plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:21:00 
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:23:33 
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:23:36 i made a millenium falcon too
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:23:40 but its just for show, it doesnt fly.
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:24:14 
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 02:24:15 maybe a x fighter
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:50:22 https://gyazo.com/df986876408f0469ea476f343b560bb1.gif
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:50:43 i successfully made it be able to also hover instead of just fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:53:33 it looks good
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:54:34 anytime there is a ship in pvp people just obliterate it
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:55:20 i like the flak cannons people make with magnet/tnt
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:00 SHIPWRIGHT [IV]

plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:28 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:51 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:52 NO
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:54 I ACCIDENTALLY

plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:57 THE SAVE
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:56:58 GOD DAMNIT
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:02 HOW
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:12 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:16 i was about to go 🦍 mode
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:38 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:39 this has 2048 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:41 but cant fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:57:43 😔
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:58:08 does it have to fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:58:20 proficiently
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:58:28 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:59:05 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:59:05 it floats
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:59:10 like a turd in a toilet
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 02:59:46 what do ballast blocks do again
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:00:08 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:00:17 so it just makes your build more dense
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:00:38 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:02:36 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:02:44 ive built a very detailed model
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:02:47 but its too fat
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:02:49 and cant get off land
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:03:19 i saw some dude make a millenium falcon
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:03:22 with working hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:03:27 he said something about conveyers
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:04:02 he said that the speed went up to 21k
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:06:06 if i insert one of those drives in my falcon
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:06:11 it may have a chance to actually launch
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:06:20 then i go see chewbacca
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:06:48 you have a v-22?
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:07:01 im over here using primitive tactics
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:07:07 just putting an ubundance of jets
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:07:11 abundance
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:07:28 https://gyazo.com/df986876408f0469ea476f343b560bb1.gif
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:08:02 i dont know how to set up motorised propellors
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:09:34 i fixed the sinking problem
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:10:17 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:11:12 i also built a chinook a year ago
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:11:19 which ironically drives better than my v22
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:11:32 it tends to sag in one direction
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:11:37 and when i try to turn the osprey
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:11:47 it kind of tilts to the other direction
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:12:27 https://gyazo.com/f5cc8f5d66b7c233419f9e283b03216e.gif
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:13:12 maybe its the problem in the back control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:13:30 when it goes plane mode instead of heli mode it flies good
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:13:35 but when i try to go for a landing
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:13:38 its very difficult
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:14:49 the top speed is near 460-500
creations-chat 2020-01-07 03:19:26 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:20:27 i dont know
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:20:37 considering a lot of people target ships/boats
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:20:39 probably a lot
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:21:57 
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:22:01 before the incident of the iraq general, i made this uav
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:23:06 <@!351848864531218442> some dude is using a generic turret
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:23:09 and spawnkilling
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:23:11 gonna put this uav to good use
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:24:20 I DID IT TO HIM
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:24:21 LOLOLOL
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:25:30 i have 16gb of ram
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:25:36 and a ryzen 5 cpu
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:25:54 i have a 2600x
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:26:04 that i got very expensively from best buy
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:26:08 cause they cant match price right
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:27:42 that moment when i have a mid tier pc
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:27:52 but kids who spawn in the max amount of jets crash my game
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:28:09 i have a rx 560
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:29:09 ram prices have really dropped
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:29:33 some are moduel
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:29:38 you can change memory on some
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:30:06 <@!351848864531218442> fun fact, i had to build that falcon on my old pc that was complete shit
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:30:18 had 6gb of ram, a pentium cpu
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:30:19 was utterly laggy
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:30:46 https://gyazo.com/e565c967eb9691ce1b12c16831a40455.gif i did it to em
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:31:08 cuts off right when the missiles make impact
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:31:44 <@!351848864531218442> if you build your own you can pay much less than a prebuilt
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:32:09 oh 🦍
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:33:11 <@456226577798135808> what graphics card do you have
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:33:24 damn
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:33:25 i have a 560
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:33:42 i could've gotten a 570 if i saved up a little more
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:33:56 1 petabyte of storage
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:34:11 1 yottabyte of ddr4 ram
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:34:45 win7 is discontinuing this year
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:34:47 i believe
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:34:52 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:36:08 time to grab one of my old towers and grab the product key
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:36:17 so i can get a basically free upgrade
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:36:45 i still got that annoying watermark
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:36:55 for windows 10
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:37:11 i bought a key off of ebay but it was 50/50
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:37:15 and i spent $3 on nothing
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:38:13 maybe if i accumulate $100 for my birthday i will buy a key
the-dump 2020-01-07 03:40:22 rip that kid 🦍
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:40:44 my pc is too hot
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:40:55 i can make an asian cuisine ontop of my case
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:41:07 my pc is worth $800
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:41:40 <@!381254083845029888> ram prices have really gotten cheaper
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:41:51 i remember paying $80 for 8gb of ddr4
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:42:03 and like 4 months later i got 16gb for $80
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:42:10 mine is 3200
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:42:52 <@!381254083845029888> is it rgb
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 03:43:05 i got the corsair sticks
general 2020-01-07 03:43:46 
general 2020-01-07 03:44:17 yes
general 2020-01-07 03:44:24 ram prices decreased dramatically
general 2020-01-07 03:44:57 i would've gotten a m.2 drive but i dont do any video editing
general 2020-01-07 03:45:07 so its not really any use to me
general 2020-01-07 03:45:16 and i already have an ssd so <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-01-07 03:48:30

general 2020-01-07 03:49:18 never buy parts from them
general 2020-01-07 03:49:24 they overcharge their hardware
creations-chat 2020-01-07 13:08:13 my millenium falcon (cannot fly unfortunately 🦍 )
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:20:19 i removed the helium blocks off my osprey and it flies way better
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:20:27 i might stop being reliant on helium
general 2020-01-07 13:23:19 if the osprey counts as both a heli and a plane then does that mean if i am legible i can get ranks vtol engineer II/aeronautical engineer II
general 2020-01-07 13:24:07 damn 😔
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:28:54 https://gyazo.com/7ff9b09c64371cfaac3d71e06df29c1e.gif i finally made it be able to hover
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:34:15 i dont know how to make motorised propellors 🦍
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:35:32 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:35:58 you dont add propellor blades?
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:36:19 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:36:31 ill replace the giant propellors
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:37:25 what speed should i set the motors to
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:37:49 and do i tweak out the torque
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:38:02 ill test out 10 speed
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:44:04 <@!287459677611098114>

plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:45:15 im over here using primitive tactics with 10 engines
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 13:45:21 while people are using conveyer drives

plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:07:54 i would say this is a success
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:08:02 i just need to find a way to make it turn faster
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 13:10:33 my osprey is capable of VTOL/aeronautical
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 13:10:53 i rid every helium block & it is capable of pitch yaw and roll
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 13:19:11 this thing has a lot of sway though

plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:26:04 is there a minimum speed limit that planes/aeronautic vehicles must have to get the ranks
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:26:24 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:26:45 The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing, and short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. Wikipedia
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:26:53 since v22 osprey classifies as both vtol and aeronatic
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:27:06 does it mean i can obtain both ranks for it <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:27:16 brick count is 457
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:27:18 no helium
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:28:31 its capable of both horizontal and verticle takeoff/landing
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:37:35 <@!163143541160148992> not much i can do about it
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:37:44 except maybe add interior
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:37:48 but then it will make it chonk

general 2020-01-10 02:51:10 😳
general 2020-01-10 02:53:57 not just name it off topic to keep it concise
general 2020-01-10 02:54:00 when i thought general
general 2020-01-10 02:54:04 i thought any range of topic
general 2020-01-10 02:54:06 including the game
general 2020-01-10 03:00:05 may i ask, why is plane crazy discussions prohibited in general
general 2020-01-10 03:00:13 thats what this discord is based off of
general 2020-01-10 03:00:32 anarchy <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-01-10 03:01:05 plane crazy is the main topic though
general 2020-01-10 03:01:08 yes
general 2020-01-10 03:03:42 yes but those rules arent concise unless you look further
general 2020-01-10 03:06:54 lets start an anarchy 😳
general 2020-01-10 03:08:10 i cant help but to think this started because i posted a cursed thomas the tank engine build 😳
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 03:08:51 that moment when the argument started because of this picture
general 2020-01-10 03:10:15 they should atleast place it lower on the general list
general 2020-01-10 03:10:20 instead of **ontop**
general 2020-01-10 03:14:32 i mean the same thing can be applied to <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-01-10 03:14:44 people might be conversating about how to do a certain thing or just talk about their builds in general
general 2020-01-10 03:14:49 and someone posts a picture of their build
general 2020-01-10 03:15:23 wait nvm im dyslexic
general 2020-01-10 03:15:30 interpreted that sentence wrong

help 2020-01-10 03:22:09 
help 2020-01-10 03:23:55 I was hoping to get VTOL engineer II (and maybe aeronautic engineer II since v22 technically counts as both). It has a block count of 457 and i rid every helium blocks. runs on a plethora of engines/propellors and is capable of yaw,pitch, and roll.

plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:42:16 steering is perfect
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:42:30 it is perfectly parallel to the water
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:42:48 
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:43:10 i just used a reference
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:43:16 half of it is submerged anyway
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:44:09 
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:44:35 i use 6 water propellors to steer
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:46:10 maybe i can do something with 1x2 half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 03:47:02

general 2020-01-11 03:51:19 "However, while both are types of passenger ships, there is a difference. An ocean liner is a ship designed to transport passengers from point A to point B. ... Cruise ships are built for the purpose of taking passengers on a journey that begins and ends in the same port."
general 2020-01-11 03:51:38 my ship is built for the journey
general 2020-01-11 03:51:49 which is why theres a jacuzzi among other things 🦍

plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:35:09 i dont understand why people show off tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:35:15 its better to learn from mistake after mistake
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:35:18 than to follow a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:35:59 because then after a while you will be able to create planes or whatever the hell you wanna make that beat the tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:36:05 bruh <:kek:652566605028524033>

plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:03:37 
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:03:41 i figured using snowblasters could convey a bubbling affect to the pool
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:04:24 unfortunately there arent any noncancollide bricks
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:04:31 and nobody can actually go in the pool

plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:15:15 search up boat prefixes
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:15:28 MV stands for motor vessel
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:15:37 since it runs on motors/propellors

general 2020-01-12 13:55:02 i hope this car doesnt have the same fate 😩
general 2020-01-12 13:56:35 oh bruh
general 2020-01-12 13:56:39 i thought i actually had it for a sec
general 2020-01-12 13:56:48 idk
general 2020-01-12 13:58:35 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-01-12 13:59:46 how it feels when u spend an hour or so on a creation then have a 1:8 like/dislike ratio in creations
general 2020-01-12 14:00:33 i spend like 10 minutes planning in my head how the blocks will go together in the build
general 2020-01-12 14:00:45 like in my cruise ship
general 2020-01-12 14:01:01 i thought how i would integrate wedgeblocks/corner wedges together
general 2020-01-12 14:01:16 to create the front of the ship
general 2020-01-12 14:07:26 <@!216193164199985152>
general 2020-01-12 14:07:46 im creating this car mesh for a game
general 2020-01-12 14:08:03 wanted some feedback
general 2020-01-12 14:08:28 an actual car
general 2020-01-12 14:08:47 
general 2020-01-12 14:08:52 it was a 1983
general 2020-01-12 14:08:55 forgot the car model
general 2020-01-12 14:09:37 
general 2020-01-12 14:09:47 i know
general 2020-01-12 14:10:13 roblox doesnt make it easy to do with its rendering
general 2020-01-12 14:10:20 when you export a mesh and you use a plane
general 2020-01-12 14:10:25 it is transparent on one end
general 2020-01-12 14:10:41 if i could i would go for complexity
general 2020-01-12 14:10:48 but roblox has a seizure when rendering so 😔
general 2020-01-12 14:11:30 no
general 2020-01-12 14:11:35 i create the mesh in blender
general 2020-01-12 14:11:40 then export it using FBX
general 2020-01-12 14:11:44 then i import the mesh in roblox
general 2020-01-12 14:12:44 exporting is just when you get the mesh you made and put it in a file
general 2020-01-12 14:13:01 then in roblox you can then import the mesh file into your studio
general 2020-01-12 14:13:47 yes
general 2020-01-12 14:13:49 exactly
general 2020-01-12 14:14:32 
general 2020-01-12 14:14:33 ive made others like this
general 2020-01-12 14:14:48 but then this bs happens
general 2020-01-12 14:15:55 its harder to do
general 2020-01-12 14:16:09 in blender you can easily manipulate shapes into whatever you want
general 2020-01-12 14:16:56 yes
general 2020-01-12 14:17:09 but i believe if i import the car chassis
general 2020-01-12 14:17:16 and doors/trunk/hood seperately
general 2020-01-12 14:17:24 it may fix the problem
general 2020-01-12 14:18:40 oh
general 2020-01-12 14:19:14 let me show you the geometry
general 2020-01-12 14:19:24 of the car im creating
general 2020-01-12 14:19:50 fucking hell gyazo isnt working 😔
general 2020-01-12 14:20:49 <@!314383347214319616> i believe most of my faces have 4 vertices
general 2020-01-12 14:22:02 bruh my adapter is acting gay <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-01-12 14:22:58 <@!314383347214319616> theres this one face in the rear render
general 2020-01-12 14:23:02 where theres multiple vertices
general 2020-01-12 14:23:11 <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-01-12 14:24:11

general 2020-01-12 14:25:06 mirror modifier
general 2020-01-12 14:25:13 makes me feel <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-01-12 14:25:50 same 😔
general 2020-01-12 14:25:56 i watched a few tutorial
general 2020-01-12 14:26:12 on booleans and mirror
general 2020-01-12 14:26:18 and watched a tutorial
general 2020-01-12 14:26:21 then i was set
general 2020-01-12 14:26:30 maya? <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-01-12 14:27:57 did rick/madattak use 3d modeling for certain wedges/blocks
general 2020-01-12 14:28:29 oh
creations-chat 2020-01-12 14:29:21 i mean if he had pride in his creation then he has the right to upvote it
creations-chat 2020-01-12 14:29:45 theres bigger issues at hand, someone self upvoting shouldnt be ontop of the list <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 19:40:21 <@!454320801303232512> you know what
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 19:40:30 your creation idea gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 19:40:36 i might make a hover car
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 19:40:44 but maybe a tad bit smaller
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 19:40:48 nice volvo btw 😳

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:24:30 theres a chance one mod will be like <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:24:51 atleast thats how it was when i joined
general 2020-01-12 20:26:10 yes <:KEKW:664957134454259744>

general 2020-01-12 20:34:04 theres an option to keep it day
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:47:42 the f22 is probably the most common tutorial build
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:47:47 and theres people who swear they are good at pvp
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:47:54 because they built it <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:48:06 i wait to see the day when i see an original f22
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:48:18 😳
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:49:35 do you become an inventor by creating machinery that would more or less improve the effectiveness of ones build
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:49:40 or just think outside the box in general
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:50:18 why was it closed
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:50:27 was it part of an event
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:51:16 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:51:45 i invented jacuzzi bubbles by using snow blaster
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:51:54 revolutionary moment
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:52:23 bruhb
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:52:29 did it actually function as one
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:53:26 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:53:30 i remember that version
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:53:53 transmission 😳
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:54:30 how can i learn
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:54:33 to use springs/suspension
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:54:40 or to use any kind of vehicle function
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:56:04 complex
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:58:29 i might have an idea for a rotary engine
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:59:13 im gonna research how it functions, the parts
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:01:46 ok so
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:01:50 rotary engines run on air combustion
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:01:53 by catching air
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:01:59 and as the rotar rotates
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:02:08 the air reacts in combustion
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:02:17 then the combustion gas spins the rotar
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:02:23 to the point where it creates power
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:02:52 im just planning out loud
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:05:15 im gonna halt my corvette production
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:05:17 and actually
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:05:29 work on a rotary
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:05:35 or atleast attempt
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:11:55 what idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:12:18 the car event?
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:26:23 https://gyazo.com/f8e54c31b07838de7f722c6eedf278ea.gif
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:26:29 i couldnt get the round equal shape for the rotar
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:26:47 and too much rocking
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:26:52 in the rotar
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:27:10 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:28:43 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:29:00 didnt people think speeds of 21k in plane crazy's earlier stages think it was impossible
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:29:03 or atleast very difficult
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:34:45 closest thing i can get to a reauleax
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:39:41 yeah i tried that kind of turret one time
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:39:47 where i attached it to a rotar
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:39:55 it just creates more spread
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:39:59 which is good i guess if you do AA
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:41:46 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:41:51 <:KEKW:664957134454259744>

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 21:47:10 how does torque affect motors
general 2020-01-12 21:59:17 THAT MOMENT WHEN
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:01:09 noncancollide bricks would also be good
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:01:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:02:04 the pool i have on my cruise ship is just 1x7 blocks with glass material
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:10:12 what are friction blocks used for
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:10:20 or what is their function
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:16:52 https://gyazo.com/ca14540c0e3f0d7e079f2d4df0621477.gif
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:16:58 i have the body down for the rotary engine
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:17:02 i now need to make it functional
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:17:16 i know they are used for drives
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:17:18 thats all i know
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:28:21 😳
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:28:48 <@!513783921134141455> do you know what friction blocks do
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:29:05 i know the name implies that it creates friction but what is its function
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:29:34 😳
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:29:49 https://gyazo.com/ca77ae88c1838c9a893e6135c44a5ebb.gif this man fr vibin though 😳

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:37:22 
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:37:26 this is my cruise ship
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 22:37:30 very small

plane-crazy 2020-01-13 00:35:20 how the motors correspond to the turning
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 00:35:28 how the engine works in general

plane-crazy 2020-01-15 13:48:01 eliminated most of the shake
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 13:48:45 maybe its because when it lowers
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 13:48:48 it just bungee jumps

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:34:06 the plane im in was the successful one while the one at the base is the one that sucked

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:37:06 conclusion: the game is broken and rick should add more wedges <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:37:24 everything from the rocket engines, plane body, other functions is the same
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:37:29 nothing should be different
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:37:52 i even tried to switch the 2nd plane seat to main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:37:54 no avail

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:42:15 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:42:18 but im trying to make a fleet
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:42:41 ok but its easy for me

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:44:42 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:45:21 one problem i have with it is the wings connecting the osprey to the propeller looks too thin

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:21 i have a system that uses ryzen 2600 with a radeon 560
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:39 <@!435946988559925248> i fucked myself over though
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:44 as soon as my 560 arrived
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:51 a 570 went on sale on amazon for $120
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:56 the same price i bought the 560 for
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:59:33 
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:59:54 <@456226577798135808> if you want to save a little more
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:59:58 you could build your own
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:10 totally in control of what you could put in your system
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:22 i knew jack shit about building pcs
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:29 hell i even almost dropped my processor 😔
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:34 but hey it works
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:53 i worked off of youtube
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:55 and manuals
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:01:06 fry a steak on the cpu
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:01:23 also you cant just fry it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:01:30 the hardware
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:01:40 you have to be a professional dumbass to fry the hardware
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:02:09 its all in the matter of screwing things in, plugging in cables correctly, then booting windows or whatever on the pc
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:03:10 the payoff is good, you get a custom pc with the parts you like, would pay less
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:03:23 you might feel confident in yourself
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:03:40 you might grow an inch or two
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:03:54 might become one with allah

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:05:35 best buy is notorious for overblowing their shit prices on parts that you could get cheaper elsewhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:06:02 i bought my 2600 for $200 fucking dollars when i could've went on amazon and payed $150

plane-crazy 2020-04-28 00:57:04 so if rockets go a tad bit faster than the creation you launched them frome
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 00:57:21 you can possibly create a lightspeed rocket if you go 8.2435256239532e+ speed or some shit like that 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 00:58:53 no i mean the pvp rocket
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 00:59:25 im over here going mach 2+ speed and the rocket outbeats me

plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:07:00 vip3
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:34:49 might have just designed a better efficient, more smaller microfighter than my last <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:35:04 what if i worked on the map 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:35:15 time to make the terrain out of blender and make the game more laggy
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:36:21 the take off is clean as HELL

plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:41:03 
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:41:14 show
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:41:47 i like the retractable canopy
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:42:02 maybe the front of it can be more symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:42:11 looks too square for me
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:43:13 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:48:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:49:58 it runs on a single drive and 3 propellers
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:50:08 no gay rocket engines or helium
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:51:04 what i just realized is that because the width of the new microjet is smaller, i can make the fuselage of the 747 thinner and make it better looking <:PogChamp:516298810700464128>
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:52:09 ironically the smaller model i made is more efficient in flying and turning than the bigger one

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:58:26 i could hide the motorlock better
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 22:04:58 would it be possible to fit a full sized 747 with the scale im using
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 22:05:00 in one plot
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 22:05:02 <:Huskattak:624726402209415218>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 22:05:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 22:05:37 i did the dimensions for my jet engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:53:23 
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:53:30 hopefully the nose looks better than last time
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:54:13 747 carrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:47:44 
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:51:38 i didnt really see a problem with the mech
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:52:00 combined two images
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:52:01 made epic bp
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:58:22 
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:58:24 just gonna do this
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:58:27 the tip of the nose is black
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 20:58:46 it looks like its accurate to the bp

plane-crazy 2020-12-01 23:11:26 
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 02:50:11 did some measurements
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 02:50:20 my 747 will probably carry a minimum of 7 microfighters

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 02:22:40 
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 02:22:45 this might actually turn out to be 1:1
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 02:22:48 and not out of wack
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 02:23:05 i did measurements and it will fit a minimum of 6 microfighters
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:24:55 
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:25:00 its coming together
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:27:01 if everything goes right
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:27:07 I could fit at least 6 of the microfighters
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:27:33 2 of them will be operational
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 15:28:02 everything is 1:1
