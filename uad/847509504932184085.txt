plane-crazy 2022-10-15 20:26:26 is it hard building a helicopter from scratch if you only just started with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 13:32:46 trying to build apache from scratch, whats the best way to make the cockpit? angled with pistons and motors ?
help 2022-10-16 14:34:43 i have this design on my helicopter, i need landing gear on it, do i just use motor and cover it up with a half brick or how can i motorlock the 1x1.5gap
help 2022-10-16 15:57:00 i have this hull design on my helicopter, i need landing gear on it, do i just use a motor and cover it up with a half block or how can i possibly motorlock the 1x1.5 gap?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 16:34:05 Whys an Apache nose with good cockpit so hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 16:55:29 Why do so many Apache‚Äôs in pc have the same cockpit but I can‚Äôt find any image here or in any discord showing the build of the same cockpit everyone uses
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 16:56:47 Well I did find a image but it was like 10 stacks of motor lock cuz it also included the nose

general 2022-10-16 17:13:30 Why do so many apache‚Äôs have the same cockpit but I can‚Äôt find a clue where they got it from
general 2022-10-16 17:35:36 I just can‚Äôt look at that cockpit, everyone has those kind of cockpits on their Apache and I just can‚Äôt find a clue on how they build it
general 2022-10-16 17:36:14 I‚Äôve tried different wedges and angling but I can‚Äôt find the right ones
general 2022-10-16 17:55:27 I‚Äôm trying camera angling rn, but my trail dissapears, I thought only the camera should dissapear?
general 2022-10-16 18:00:27 Why does my trail move 1 block to the side when I‚Äôm camera angling
general 2022-10-16 18:02:11 I also found out how to place the trails for my cockpit, but now I need to find out how to get them in place with motor lock while also having to motor lock the actual cockpit in
general 2022-10-16 18:03:14 I‚Äôm still working on learning it but my angled trails move 1 block to the side
general 2022-10-16 18:54:41 My pain of motorlocking is going to begin, i have 0 motorlock experience
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 18:55:59 I'm going to try motorlocking a cockpit, i have 0 experience so i kinda need some tips??
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 18:58:02 oh okay, thanks
general 2022-10-16 19:29:16 I sort of made my cockpit for my Apache but I can‚Äôt put trails on top cuz I‚Äôm not that advanced with motor locking
general 2022-10-16 19:30:42 Can‚Äôt send images yet but I‚Äôm kinda proud of my cockpit although I‚Äôm gonna change it up a bit

general 2022-10-16 19:33:25 90% of the player base is kids, they probably got the game cuz it‚Äôs free, and now they‚Äôre toxic little kids
general 2022-10-16 19:34:57 That‚Äôs nothing compared to Dutch kids
general 2022-10-16 19:35:31 It‚Äôs fun
general 2022-10-16 19:37:07 So close to image perms, then I can show my trash cockpit
general 2022-10-16 19:43:49 Oh damn i ruined my cockpit and I didn‚Äôt save it before making changes
general 2022-10-16 19:48:29 Dead cuz I‚Äôm concentrating on ruining my Apache cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:51:24 what i made vs what i tried to make, i lowkey need help
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:52:37 Roast mine
help 2022-10-16 20:00:29 I collected a pontoon today, I only started playing yesterday
general 2022-10-16 20:00:56 I bet that car is better than my cockpit
general 2022-10-16 20:01:31 Nah it‚Äôs not look in plane crazy it‚Äôs trash
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:20:57 The real pain is trying to build a 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:23:33 I found this picture of someone‚Äôs Apache nose build with cockpit, I deadass went to their dm to try and get permission to rebuild it with a couple changes
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:24:34 Not if I haven‚Äôt build it yet and I asked kindly for his permission for changes for mine
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:26:17 How that carrier sailing when it‚Äôs hollow
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:26:51 That carrier looks like a British carrier handicapped
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:26:55 No hate tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:28:09 Idk if there‚Äôs a height limit cuz he could‚Äôve build the hull vertical instead of horizontal
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:32:58 That‚Äôs just pure skill, kids would say that‚Äôs a 3D model imported

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 07:24:02 what is the shape of this apache window supposed to be, i cant figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 07:36:13 It‚Äôs supposed to be this window (not my image)
help 2022-10-17 09:26:50 what wedges were used for the glass, i can see the small half wedge but idk the rest
help 2022-10-17 14:12:05 how do i get this this to move a half block back, it for some reason doesnt work with a motor
general 2022-10-17 14:23:04 Anyone here knows how to move something back half a block, motor doesn‚Äôt work
general 2022-10-17 14:24:48 But it‚Äôs the side of my helicopter, I can‚Äôt have my motor lock exposed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:47:34 What is this, cuz a wing panel can‚Äôt be made glass
general 2022-10-18 19:04:45 After 3 or 4 days I figured out how to make a window for my heli
general 2022-10-18 19:05:06 I was so stupid to think it was 5 blocks high but it was 2.5
general 2022-10-18 19:07:41 Exposed motorlock tho but there‚Äôs no other way to make the window then
general 2022-10-18 19:14:01 Gta 5 Akula is the only real name
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 19:15:04 finally got the window, now i need to make the actual hull
general 2022-10-18 19:17:09 I suck with helicopters too it took me 4 days to build a cockpit and now I need to add trails and hull and there‚Äôs half a block of motorlock sticking out underneath the helicopter
general 2022-10-18 19:17:59 No, I got permission to use someone‚Äôs build as inspiration and used his cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 19:18:24 Cuz I need to add trails still and maybe delta wings
general 2022-10-18 19:19:24 Now is the hard part of my cockpit, motorlocking frame in over the glass (trails with delta wings)
general 2022-10-18 19:29:32 My first helicopter was a tutorial helicopter and it couldn‚Äôt even fly so bad did I mess a ‚ÄúTUTORIAL‚Äù up
help 2022-10-20 15:07:43 how do i motorlock this to the red area, if i attach it to the motor it messes up my motorlock
help 2022-10-20 15:07:48 
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 15:20:44 how do i motorlock this to the red area, if i attach it to the motor it messes up my motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 16:08:54 I‚Äôll do when I‚Äôm home, it‚Äôs all on the ground rn except the motor and wing panel
help 2022-10-20 18:05:12 how can i motorlock the parts to the red line cuz if i add them normaly it messes up my motorlock, it also has to go half a block back which i cant figure out how to too for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 18:06:17 how can i motorlock the parts to the red line cuz if i add them normaly it messes up my motorlock, it also has to go half a block back which i cant figure out how to too for some reason
general 2022-10-20 18:45:14 Advanced or simple cockpit for a Apache?
help 2022-10-20 18:52:51 It has to go half a block back and the 3 block gap has to become a one block gap but if I add it to the motorlock already it messes up my motorlock
help 2022-10-20 18:55:31 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 19:17:53 Fu-
general 2022-10-20 20:07:23 Honestly might just quit on my  Apache, isn‚Äôt gonna work anyway my cockpit
general 2022-10-20 20:08:27 I feel like that yeah, I was allowed to use someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs cockpit and messed that up too, but it‚Äôs complicated and you couldn‚Äôt see every bit
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 20:15:39 cuz I keep failing my own Apache nose should i make a Apache from tutorial and model some bits to my own liking, and ofc controls and rotor etc to my own
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 10:39:23 Caught someone building a F-16 YouTube tutorial <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 10:40:07 It didn‚Äôt even look like the tutorial he build
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 10:40:28 Bro thinks he funny
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:20:38 im getting somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:21:05 Apache
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:21:14 Thanks
help 2022-10-21 18:26:03 uhm, how do i prevent this
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 19:06:05 what do i add at the red circle cuz i know nothing myself
help 2022-10-21 19:11:27 Motorlock sticking out underneath
general 2022-10-21 19:38:34 Why you taking photos of my puppy man
general 2022-10-22 14:11:44 i just discoved a life saver, if you press ctrl c in game, and ctrl v in discord, it automatically gets your image, no having to save it on your device
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:13:26 istg im bout to make a tutorial helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:13:51 Also who‚Äôs in game rn?
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:14:28 Cuz apparently if you press ctrl c in game and ctrl v in discord, you can send image, no need to screenshot
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:31:52 no, you just have skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:42:38 Dunce, all you need to do is flex creations
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:43:20 Down vote
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:43:48 You‚Äôre missing a main pilot seat I think, that‚Äôs why your plane won‚Äôt fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:44:31 Upvote
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 18:37:33 I basically know motorlock now, but now I reached the fun part of my build, angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 18:37:34 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 19:54:15 do i angle lock something here or no
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 19:59:46 Will winter items come back this winter instead of having to buy them for robux
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 20:00:07 Great, I could use them for my Apache if I don‚Äôt keep messing smth up
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 20:01:26 Im still not sure if I wanna anglelock the sides of my Apache or not
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 20:03:47 How do people get this type of text
help 2022-10-22 20:06:54 How can I get this type of text on my sign
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 21:08:19 Do I angle lock smth or nah
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:23:23 how do i spice up this cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:23:45 Apache
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:24:29 I might try cover up the motorlock in the cockpit itself
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:24:41 but idk if I can manage to cover the outside
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:38:46 much better aleady
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:43:20 Its pretty much impossible to add a seat or smth in the cockpit due to my motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:46:51 What
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 09:49:16 I‚Äôm not that motorlock experienced yet, I can try my best
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 10:54:30 How can I improve this cuz I‚Äôm not that pc experienced, only 28 in game hours
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 10:55:16 But this motorlock is simple
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 10:55:44 pretty simple ig
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 10:58:03 It‚Äôs currently 5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 10:58:44 6 yeah mb
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 11:35:27 Gun i am still working, still looking through every Apache image in this discord for inspiration
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 11:43:24 Thanks, i might just use a FireyOblivion tutorial for single rotor with blade flapping
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 11:56:18 Apache engines once I get tho that part will kill me
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:23:09 ig this could work
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:23:26 Not single rotor which will upset some people
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:40:30 this wil be a pain to continue building
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:41:07 Thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:55:34 do i move the missiles back 2 blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:56:49 I think I might cuz in real life it‚Äôs slight after the rotor
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:57:51 Only if I watch a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:58:15 I recommend FireyOblivion helicopter basics
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 12:58:39 Np
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:17:55 Alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:29:55 I'm struggling filling this red part up due to how i build my motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:32:47 half wedge is the only way i can do it, cuz half block will lock to my motor lock and mess it up
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:33:02 we need a quarter block for this type of situations
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:40:20 So I think now my pain will start, because I now need to build apaches engines and tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:54:10 keep or change?
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 13:59:21 this will be a pain
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:00:23 maybe the apache will be a bit way too long if i look at it now
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:01:27 it has 1 motor exposed on each side, but i kinda covered it half
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:01:43 and if i have a glass cockpit, youll see so much more motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:02:48 
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:03:20 this apache will be way to long
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:04:17 Rn my Apache is basically an inspiration from tmen and some tips from this discord
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:06:02 I could put a disconnector with it
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:06:55 
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:07:00 better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:08:12 u mean this?
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:17:22 how to improve
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:18:11 I also now realised, my helicopter only runs on 2 super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:18:44 I don‚Äôt think I can due to my motorlocking and design
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:19:17 how can i add engines to this
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:21:22 Does super rocket engine work better
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:22:54 How fast is the average helicopter in pc
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:23:44 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:23:56 And maybe I should build rotors if I wanna test how fast my heli goes
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:27:39 Good for single rotor or also for double
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:30:27 <@906661510212890657> a big pipe with wings this is a example
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:32:04 Easiest plane is mig-19 cuz it‚Äôs just a pipe with wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:37:41 ehh this could work
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 14:38:34 My nose without canopy and the slope down to the tail is basically a 99% tmen inspiration
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 15:43:19 I join pc to work on my Apache
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 15:43:27 I see the biggest brick flying through the sky
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 15:55:37 keep or make new better engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 16:07:50 How good with motorlock are you
general 2022-10-23 16:16:36 Nice, joined a new server after disconnecting, the first thing I see when joining is an airbus beluga backfliping
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 16:34:02 This dude didn‚Äôt just ask me ‚Äúwut this‚Äù like bruh it‚Äôs an helicopter can‚Äôt you see lmao
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 16:55:29 wil i get hated for this motor as decoration cuz ppl might see it as exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 17:58:50 Due to small motorlock i cant add trails on the red line, should i up my motorlock just for these 2 trails?
general 2022-10-23 18:09:52 Is anyone who likes small details able to read a quick message in <#384021699466756107> and answer yes or no
help 2022-10-23 18:54:45 i wanna have another trail on top of my cockpit, but if i add a trail (the red trail) it goes into the ground, how can i add a trail on top whitout the trails going into the ground
help 2022-10-23 18:58:56 thank you sir, i used the gap underneath the cockpit to make it so that no trails connects to the motorlock, thank you very much
help 2022-10-23 18:59:29 Without your comment I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the gap underneath the cockpit cuz I wouldn‚Äôt have looked at the cockpit cuz it‚Äôs done
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:04:02 Finally managed to have trails on the cockpit cuz of someone‚Äôs help
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:07:47 Damn went for a test flight, saw a trail was visible now I have to check all 18 trails which one I didn‚Äôt configure
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:13:58 the worst exposed motorlock in pc history??
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:48:21 shorter tail or nah
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:49:47 A normal server is also peaceful if it‚Äôs non PvP
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:50:27 Also you can just say if you wanna build my Apache I can just send some screenshots of it
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:51:42 I need to make my Apache fly too still
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 19:51:49 No rotor and no propellers either
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 20:43:13 my apache WIP, time to get off almost 11pm here
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 20:43:54 i basically made this whole thing today in 8 hours while i spend 27 hours on a cockpit which i scrapped
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 21:01:19 Should I wait with my Apache till Christmas to collect all the event items I‚Äôll need to spice up my Apache, cuz it‚Äôs basically done it just needs a rotor and some propellers
general 2022-10-23 21:01:26 Should I wait with my Apache till Christmas to collect all the event items I‚Äôll need to spice up my Apache, cuz it‚Äôs basically done it just needs a rotor and some propellers
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 08:11:11 is it hard to get this camo? so yes do i have to motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 08:29:41 thrizets?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 08:31:35 ive seen his video, it looks pain to set it up
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 08:31:46 might just make a basic su-57 no camo
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:08:57 place 2 blocks under the tezt, select your color and drag your cursor from the blocks to the text
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:09:18 basically drag over it
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:20:17 Hmm, anyone knows why my Apache is wobbling up and down, is it cuz I have no propellers yet?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:21:45 Thanks, the wobbling is less but still when I press w for my super rocket engines my Apache goes for a backflip
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:24:26 No idea how I am gonna add propellers in the back of my Apache as the tail isn‚Äôt made out of motorlock or smth
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:25:20 Not for my tail but for the rest yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:25:52 I removed my tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:26:07 Gonna cover the propellers up with disconnectors if I can
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:29:12 Cannon on wheels
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:30:25 Motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:30:39 Or normal idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:30:46 I build helicopters and planes
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:31:36 Istg how do propellers work i have 1 propellor and it‚Äôs still too much cuz it tilts so much forward
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:35:49 I was happy with my Apache, but now that it can‚Äôt fly idk about it
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:36:34 I tested it before I made the tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:36:45 But I also just realised I have no stabiliser or smth in the tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:41:21 I might just use this Apache as a first ever built in my saves and work on my new Su-57 which is pain cuz I have 38 hours
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 12:22:10 building a su-57 with no plane experience actually kinda hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 12:46:06 this good for a su-57?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 13:26:16 hows my su-57 so far?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 13:36:53 nah, after the cockpit theres a giant ramp, im changing it rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 13:37:02 im not plane experienced so this is hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 14:53:06 Should I make this camo for my Su-57
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 14:53:55 Because I think this one is too hard for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 14:55:02 Oh yeah that‚Äôs true
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 14:55:03 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:07:02 whys all camos so hard, might just make my own cuz i cant build flat shapes well of pictures
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:10:49 colors are easy with that but building all shapes for the wings is hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:12:39 okay thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:22:09 i dont see 10 blue colors in the picture but this will do
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:38:22 i have no idea how to connect the top one, and the fact i need to create 2 more wing layers too
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:41:20 how
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:41:45 cuz i cant add trails to the side
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:42:47 got it, cameras
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:44:40 bro i was in my mind "how do you know this is a su-57" cuz it was a mess still
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:44:45 thanks still tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:45:41 but cameras work too, or might camers bug out the plane later?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:13:29 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:13:39 not the most accurate camo but i tried
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:14:18 Engine and intake will be a pain I think
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:22:49 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:23:15 might have to see if there are intake tutorials on youtube which i might be able to use lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 16:42:48 impressive su-57, i wanted to try but im not sure if i am experienced enough yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 17:20:03 should i start a f22?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 17:26:27 There‚Äôs a difference
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 17:27:09 Your discord name is a anime show
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:01:13 Going to abandon my Apache and Su-57
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:01:35 neither are done, I‚Äôm gonna work on a F22 which I‚Äôll probably abandon once and work on smth else once again üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:12:07 Turn on do not disturb
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:13:23 Depends on how big your f15 is
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:13:32 But most intakes with most jets are 1
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:14:11 How wide is your body
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:14:36 I meant cockpit, canopy nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:16:03 7 is wide enough, make it 6 because you‚Äôll need 1 for the intake
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:38:25 Yo
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:47:46 With?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 19:43:36 i dont know how these  can look similar
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 19:51:46 youtube can
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:16:54 What? There‚Äôs 1000s of tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:17:14 There‚Äôs this tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:17:19 On F22 wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:17:26 8 hours ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:17:34 It‚Äôs good wdym
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:17:59 The wings aren‚Äôt lame like most tutorial planes
general 2022-10-24 20:22:30 Where do you life to have school rn? It‚Äôs 22:22pm here
general 2022-10-24 20:23:38 I know but where in the world are you if it‚Äôs around 12:00-14:00 and in school
general 2022-10-24 20:24:15 That fast?
general 2022-10-24 20:24:43 How‚Äôs boris‚Äô replacement gone already, was she that bad
general 2022-10-24 20:25:23 I did see a tiktok tho with them booing the prime minister for minutes
general 2022-10-24 20:30:00 What type of Ohio stuff is that
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:36:31 Some of y‚Äôall on another level
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:36:52 Y‚Äôall can build a F22 in a week meanwhile it‚Äôs gonna take me months probably and then it can‚Äôt even fly properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:38:04 Can‚Äôt even fly my helicopter even after FireyOblivion tutorials on helicopter basics
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:39:03 If we get decals we can make better camos on wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:40:15 Nice A-10
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:40:31 That jet in the background tho üëÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:41:06 Is that his Su-57
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:41:33 Damn it, he knows I‚Äôm struggling with mine, he didn‚Äôt have to flex like that
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:42:37 But it‚Äôs meh
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:43:20 Imo El Frossy has a great one
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:44:09 Due to El Frossy‚Äôs Su-57 tutorial I managed to find the shape for the wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:39:51 This kid mad cuz I said Santa has 9 reindeers and he thinks it‚Äôs five
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:39:52 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:40:04 He build 5 for his sleigh
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:41:36 Why he private messaging me ‚ÄúWHO‚Äù like bruh I know you‚Äôre gonna say who asked
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:42:49 But that‚Äôs easy
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:43:10 I don‚Äôt see how anyone needs help with that
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 08:51:03 Damn school, I‚Äôm sitting here at home waiting for that solar eclipse
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:22:29 apache
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:23:23 Time to work on my f22 now
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 11:48:47 harder than i thought
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:34:43 having no jetpack is pain
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:35:52 there need to be 2 more layers of motorlock on top and on that i have to build the wings and stuff for the intake
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:40:17 building on top will be pain
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:45:16 this 250 block motorlock tower turns into a 3x3 block <:what:644996672048463942>  250 blocks for a 3x3 block that adds detail
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:45:45 wouldnt surprise me if this jet will have 1000+ blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:46:59 what does drag on hover thruster do
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:52:21 what is ignore others on hover thruster
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 13:58:27 is this enough?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:00:50 might just have to go with 8 hover thrusters instead of 36 cuz my laptop not the best and its probably gonna be alot of lag cuz my f22 will probably be 1000 blocks+
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:01:13 its at 413 blocks rn and i only have a nose which isnt done either
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:13:46 Might have to sacrifice 3 euros for a jetpack
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:14:29 No way
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:14:41 Robux prices are 20% higher now
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:15:09 Or my roblox is in dollars now i have no idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:15:33 I don‚Äôt remember 800 being 12 bucks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:16:11 12 for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:16:30 
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:16:59 Bruh I don‚Äôt have 40 robux option and above 800
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:18:33 Thats 1/10th of what I have
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:19:27 My f22 rn:
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:22:21 Hmm you can build outside the border with 1x7 beam
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:23:41 jetpack at home:
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:30:42 Watch them all be tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:08 
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:46 Let me grab a boat and some flex tape real quick
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:50 <@638065544561426451> built something with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:34:24 No tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:38:27 <@638065544561426451>'s motorlock plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:39:15 There‚Äôs 0 trouble when building motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:40:46 So? Instead of lame wings you can make this
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:41:54 Every jet is military
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:00:28 god damn this looks nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:03:21 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:03:41 But motorlock is a feature
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:03:43 Not a glitch
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:05:02 But it‚Äôs not my build
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:05:27 But I can literally build that wheel rn without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:12 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:17 Folding is easy
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:25 you just need a motor and cameras
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:08:15 But then your builds get downvoted because they look lame with no detail
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:09:34 I have a motorlock tower rn whit 4 motorlocks on the side rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:09:35 <:kerrorEZ:1021740720857563206>
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:33 Even if you play 2 hours a day, after a week you still can have a amazing build
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:12:42 <@638065544561426451> do you build your builds by pictures
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:13:26 Did you use a 3D model for shapes
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:15:37 this is way easier, especially for wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:21:50 Windows key for sign?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:22:12 I can‚Äôt copy and paste cuz my laptop broken or smth, what do you think I go through
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:23:27 I don‚Äôt use emojis (yet) so I don‚Äôt go through that pain (yet)
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:06:37 we getting somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:07:23 now have to copy it to the other side, aka my 5th sideways motorlock attached to the motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:08:19 2 are for the intakes 1 for the wing and 1 is still being used for idk and now my 5th the 2nd wing
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:24:09 Im getting kinda bored building this F22 rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:24:33 but I‚Äôm not stopping, everything is just gonna take 3 times longer due to watching tiktok every block placed
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:31:21 Su-57 but I have the wings already aka the fun part cuz of the camo‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:34:54 I mean it better does, no way I am rebuilding this F22 again
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:35:17 Currently 570 blocks for a nose with wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:52:52 alright
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:57:54 cant you just place the piston higher
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 16:58:53 like this
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 17:25:35 Time for f22 intakes
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 17:25:36 <:kerrorRAGE:1021740719959965736> <:kerrorRAGE:1021740719959965736>
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 18:36:10 A good looking F22 intake is actually hard ngl
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 18:45:54 Hell nah this tank camping people‚Äôs plot got absolutely destroyed by a random jets bombs and guns and rockets, he didn‚Äôt even see him coming
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 18:46:01 Tank rage quit btw
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 18:54:20 I wouldnt mind it as chirstmas gift
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 18:54:35 as long as winter event items come back before pc2 im happy
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:20:30 These f22 intakes are so hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:25:18 But I‚Äôm trying to make a detailed f22, not some blocky tutorial f22
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:27:11 Tiktok logo is 50% white
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:27:36 There isn‚Äôt even black beside the box around it
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:05:19 when i spawn my jet in, why does it spawn more to the right than it was before spawning in
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:06:52 welp this is where im leaving my f22 at today, intakes are such pain detailed so no progress in 5 hours
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:51:51 Yeah? I only have 54 hours or smth, I‚Äôm not experienced enough to do it in an hour
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:53:32 At first i thought it was this sukhoi, but it‚Äôs an F14 apparently
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:55:12 Thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:55:19 I already knew that tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 11:51:14 getting somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 11:51:39 dont mind the nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 11:51:46 i didnt set it up for this pic
general 2022-10-26 12:28:20 pc2 would be too boring they said cuz its the same but just a better map and some new blocks
general 2022-10-26 12:31:05 and then you look at the map once and go to building again
general 2022-10-26 12:31:48 yep
general 2022-10-26 12:32:03 winter items update
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 12:53:45 definitely messed something up
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 12:57:01 Now I have to check the whole 700 block build, cuz my nose pieces aren‚Äôt working anymore either
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:05:06 this better? apparently i accidentally placed a half block in the motorlock tower
general 2022-10-26 13:05:19 Wdym motorlock works fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:05:45 dont mind the nose and the rest thats not working
general 2022-10-26 13:05:59 It says 2021
general 2022-10-26 13:06:52 I used to have a 2016 discord account which got banned for underage tho I‚Äôm 13+
general 2022-10-26 13:07:52 Also, why do people place explosives and balls and explode the balls onto the whole server thinking it‚Äôs gonna effect our performance although it does nothing
general 2022-10-26 13:08:27 Still tryna figure out how to get color roles, I probably need a certain role
general 2022-10-26 13:12:30 John do you need expert to get color roles
general 2022-10-26 13:13:05 Sadge, can‚Äôt get a color role until my f22 is done which will probably get 50/50 votes
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:13:31 I‚Äôm not
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:13:35 It just looks like it
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:14:11 Yeah I have it on automatic, dunno if it can handle full manual
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:18:16 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:19:27 Ugh
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:19:44 I had to fix motorlock tower where it didn‚Äôt exactly lock into place
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 13:20:09 And now my stuff for the nose moved down half a block and now that‚Äôs not correct anymore
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 15:42:05 Hmm I have a problem which I don‚Äôt have any idea how it is happening
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 15:42:33 The cameras attached to my motorlock which are frozen due to disconnectors move half a block down
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 15:42:45 and that‚Äôs causing my nose to mess up
help 2022-10-26 15:43:16 Why do my camera‚Äôs move half a block down when spawning in to test, cuz the motors are frozen due to motorlock
help 2022-10-26 15:54:41 Neither
help 2022-10-26 15:54:43 It‚Äôs too blocky
help 2022-10-26 15:55:17 Try something like this <@700813401030393896>
help 2022-10-26 15:56:44 Ooh canopy I didn‚Äôt read well
help 2022-10-26 15:56:57 Right in my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:06:08 Omg
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:06:18 cuz all my cameras move half a block down for no reason
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:06:28 It has messed up every part for my jet‚Äôs nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:16:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:17:17 forward, but mine move down
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:18:02 do i use text instead of cameras then for my nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:18:58 no way to keep them in the same place?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:19:23 motorlock for my cockpit?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:21:33 i only need the underneath of my nose, but i also use the motorlock its connected to for small details for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:21:54 ok wait i accidentally pressed enter
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:24:05 
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:25:05 its 1.5 blocks so i need to angle some pieces to make sure the nose goes from the triangle to the half wedges
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:56:56 So after being afk for a bit I decide to fly my unfinished f22 and my f22 decided it be funny for the motorlock to stop itself from connecting to the body
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:57:42 This build can‚Äôt get any better
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:03:03 And now it works again, what kinda pc magic is this
help 2022-10-26 17:49:15 My version of a Su-57 camo because im not an expert
help 2022-10-26 17:49:31 the real version looks pretty close to that
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:49:50 
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:49:58 I wanna quit my F22 and work on my Su-57 now
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:53:52 It‚Äôs not even done
help 2022-10-26 17:59:19 thanks :)
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:59:33 tell me why and where
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:59:38 so i can try to improve
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 17:59:40 it
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:02:02 atleast i lowered the wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:10:24 üòî
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:15:49 motorlock problems
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:17:48 I now have a Apache and F22 which aren‚Äôt good the community says, time to see how bad my Su-57 wil be
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:19:55 My F22 could maybe, it‚Äôs just nobody wants to say why it‚Äôs bad and what I could improve
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:20:26 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:20:57 Quitting pc seems like the best option rn

plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:56:41 you cant motorlock trapdoors?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:58:18 hmm i guess i am doing something wrong then
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:01:39 whys this not working, am i this dumb
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:03:29 im just tryna design a 2x1.5 intake for f22 but i guess trap door wont attach to my motors and lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:04:38 its the only way to make them fold
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:04:45 into the right place
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:42:57 he has to run his frikandellen business
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:04:26 f22 intakes opinion? bottom part is attached to jet already and  i need to fix up the back of the intake
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:16:07 its not entirely perfect, i just wanted to see how it looks like when its all together thats why the white mess on the right
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:18:30 just let me be happy okay, atleast someone finally said something is decent for my f22
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:19:07 is it done ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:20:22 i didnt rotate it, it just fell to that side due to ther ebeing cameras under the left light gray delta wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:21:44 cuz im not experienced enough yet, i might try angling cuz the motorlock its attached to is frozen because of nose parts and cockpit details
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:22:22 and i got into it 3-4 days ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:22:56 ok wait not 3-4 days thats when i begun my f22, but probably a week ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:24:21 could the intakes i made work on a f35 if i angle them
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:24:48 and also add a bottom delta wing too
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:51:49 here we go again for gods sake
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:54:53 how am i supposed to build this one and a half block down
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:07:47 Would look better if you managed to have the inside black after a block
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:08:03 Still looks good tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:10:22 You didn‚Äôt have to do that, his first language isn‚Äôt English
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:11:01 Did I say it was rude?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:11:04 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:12:35 It‚Äôs not
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:12:47 the ramp at the bottom isn‚Äôt flat
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:12:59 Every game has that
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:14:32 So? Am I not allowed to make a comment Mr. Grammar corrector who doesn‚Äôt use grammar in his correction and his own sentences
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:16:02 That‚Äôs me yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:16:09 What‚Äôs wrong with the sentence huh
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:16:21 Grammar*
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:16:47 Why do you wanna know ‚ÄúMinecraft player‚Äù
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:16:56 Cuz my ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù is better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:17:57 Did I say it was for kids?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:17:59 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:18:13 So?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:18:55 Atleast I don‚Äôt correct grammar while not being able to correctly spell grammar
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 21:20:31 But you‚Äôre not even spelling y‚Äôall correctly

plane-crazy 2022-10-27 09:45:55 i dont get why my intakes work fine, but when i attach them to my motorlock, they dont work properly anymore
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 10:32:03 Where do I put my landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 10:32:42 A plane
creations-chat 2022-10-27 13:02:53 alr, let me just give it a downvote real quick
creations-chat 2022-10-27 13:14:19 the blue angels build was better imo
creations-chat 2022-10-27 13:17:33 Yeah, you didn‚Äôt even try make the wings less blocky while it‚Äôs so damm easy
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 14:07:16 opinion on vertical stabilizers for F22?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 14:07:35 good shapes or change it up a bit
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 14:12:32 Getting these vertical stabilisers in place will be a pain
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 14:14:23 Build a block
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 14:15:17 Upvote
help 2022-10-27 15:17:41 how can i get this whole wing to angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 15:21:11 fill up with half wedges or nah
help 2022-10-27 16:12:28 It doesn‚Äôt work for me, but I‚Äôm not angle lock experienced so I might be doing something wrong still
help 2022-10-27 16:32:29 Cuz I motorlock it in?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:12:41 ^ when you mentioned pistons and hover i thought glitch engine but i dont understand it anymore after the roll, pitch etc
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:41 Are there 4 pistons?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:46 And 2 hovers
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:59 Oh I see now
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:50 like this?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:59:03 left or right intake
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:01:11 bro its the best jet wdym
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:06:03 ^ he made good F18 after that
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:07:51 cuz my f22 is bad, can i call it a custom f22 now?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:08:53 What if I don‚Äôt angle intakes and vertical stabiliser and give wings different shape
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:09:57 My nose is too thick tho, but if I motorlock the bottom with top half a block, it messes up my whole jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 18:22:43 not this half block bs again
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 19:39:31 Hell nah I removed my nose of my F22
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 19:39:40 It was 300 blocks apparently
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 21:49:00 How do you make a cone for eurofighter nose for example, just a whole lot of anglelock?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 21:50:09 What block do I use then to make the cone?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 21:54:56 <:wait:652565313337950230>
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 21:55:24 That‚Äôs a whole lot of delta wings and a extremely higher motorlock tower then i think
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 22:02:23 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 22:02:59 Still have my bad F22 to build, after that maybe a f16 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 22:03:04 Or finish my Su-57
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 22:23:22 But you didn‚Äôt start playing like 1.5 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 06:49:41 Turn on auto save
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 10:44:31 train opinion? i got bored so yeah...
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:53:36 But no robux
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:57:36 Welp that‚Äôs too bad then
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:18:28 White name = getting bullied for your builds
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:18:57 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:18:57 Me and my F22
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:19:39 No way this random dude placed walls of camera cuz I can‚Äôt enter his plot and I‚Äôm not blacklisted
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:23:03 LukeP
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:32:28 Someone name a jet to build rather than this failure f22
general 2022-10-28 12:34:03 Stop flexing the jet I want <:kerrorRAGE:1021740719959965736>
general 2022-10-28 12:34:50 Idrc about the bottom one
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:39:05 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:39:05 F16 I can only make the intake cuz of a tutorial I saw today
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:40:17 Give me a sec I‚Äôll make one rq from the tut it‚Äôs pretty good
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:42:08 <@619947837085450241>
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:42:12 For f16
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:43:42 Its control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:44:04 You have to jump out your seat while holding the controls to get it in the right place tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:44:34 
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:45:10 Its 3 wide tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 13:01:41 Nose probably
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 16:27:27 vulpen are you aware that sometimes when you show build mode you show the entire build but say you arent gonna show all due to copy
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 16:29:28 Was about to say, what kind of ultimate expert do you have to be to steal that build whitout seeing the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 16:37:43 Anyone can steal your f16 now for example
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 16:58:05 Just chat till level 3
bot-central 2022-10-28 16:58:39 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:25:27 Place the green inside the the grey
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:25:31 With motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:26:43 So that the green is in the ground as actual grass
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:26:59 And maybe use grass texture
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:27:19 Np
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:36:50 Why should we trust you then?
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:37:30 Atleast my builds don‚Äôt have 6 exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:39:00 Atleast none are exposed
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:40:03 When you think you‚Äôre funny
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:40:29 You don‚Äôt have expert, you think you are one and can shit talk anyone‚Äôs build, you‚Äôre basically a white name still
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:40:43 Idk, I‚Äôm just doing something
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:41:44 Sure sure Lukie Boi
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:42:13 You talk bad about my builds, how about I roast every build you‚Äôve made so far
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:43:05 In your opinion does that look better than in top?
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 17:53:41 how big do you want your f16 to be
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 18:13:14 Oh its not mine
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 18:13:41 but the f16 length was the entire plot
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 18:16:10 <:wait:652565313337950230>
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 19:25:40 This dude really asks me why I blacklisted him, maybe because it looks like you‚Äôre taking pictures of every angle possible of my f22 cuz ur standing still so many times at every location
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 19:26:42 Its not even good
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:03:22 hell nah how much delta wings does a cone nose require
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:06:34 Im never thinking about making a Eurofighter typhoon again
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:06:43 Or atleast a realistic good detailed one
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:11:32 Why did I get this dumb idea that I‚Äôm gonna need to fold motorlock on top of motorlock for a cone nose, but if I did that it still wouldn‚Äôt even be inside each other the fold motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:13:29 pc2 better have cones
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:14:20 I don‚Äôt play fifa so I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs bad if it‚Äôs a fifa game?
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:15:40 Okay yeah I am hoping for that too now
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:26:40 Chat in general
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:26:54 But you‚Äôre a white name like some others so you might get bullied
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:31:04 Not me
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:31:06 But my builds
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:31:32 Exposed motorlock is a crime here sort of btw
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:34:14 I own a Apache that can‚Äôt fly, it‚Äôs also out of shape besides tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:34:23 Im not even gonna try post it in creations
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:34:48 And it‚Äôs double rotor
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:35:29 and there‚Äôs exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:36:08 I love this weapon design wingthingy tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:36:35 Definitely not from tmen üëÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:37:41 worth posting in creations?
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:38:00 It can‚Äôt fly so it‚Äôs hard taking pics in the air
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:38:22 But then I‚Äôll always be a white name
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:38:34 If I get the first role I‚Äôm fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:41:17 free trash apache no engines or controls
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:42:10 I still don‚Äôt know what jet to build, I wanna build a F22 but I‚Äôll get roasted
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:45:23 This whole day I‚Äôve been playing, I‚Äôve build a crappy train and I‚Äôve been server hopping to try find jet inspiration
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:55:22 tips for what
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:55:31 looks perfect to me
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:56:38 where in the tank do you see b...
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 20:56:51 under the barrel or besides?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 08:36:54 what is this camping kid bs
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 09:13:06 you simply join a pvp server whit no kids who dont know how to build so they become a trash shredder kid
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 09:38:33 i think im gonna start an f14 but i dont know where to start cuz everyone has these detailed noses
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 09:59:11 should i angle lock the top of the nose for a f14
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 12:44:29 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 12:44:43 I still don‚Äôt have any idea how I am gonna make my F14 nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 12:48:09 I think I am gonna start my f14 nose with a pyramid
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 12:48:11 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 14:07:33 where should you start a motorlock tower for F14? behind spine or behind canopy or where?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 14:12:07 idk how long my nose and canopy should be, should i just start a motorlock tower and build onto that?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 14:18:50 do i anglelock till the 1x2 half or make it a 1x1 half wedge down
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 14:41:52 does this tutorial tank see my 8 missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 15:53:40 how bad is this for a tomcat nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:10:23 My nightmare
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:13:28 <@791259000561074188> may I know where you put your motorlock tower? Is it after the spine or under the spine (I don‚Äôt need images of the motorlock)
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:27:48 ehh is this too smooth?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:31:37 this better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:31:59 although it looks like i just used wedges now
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:34:00 You said custom angle is a block too long so I thought you meant the angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:34:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:34:40 Thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:37:29 i use this half wedge to get the perfect angle, because it also dissapears into the nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 16:37:47 Or should I not use it cuz it might cause trouble later?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:18:51 paul walkers supra
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:19:59 see you again
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:20:14 ... khalifa
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:20:18 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:41:44 how did you put a text on a half block whitout exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:46:27 im doing something wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:46:36 also dont mind the paint job
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:47:10 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 17:50:51 idk if this is the correct way?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:05:06 I know angle lock camera lock and motorlock but wth is piston lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:05:14 Its time I go to YouTube again
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:07:01 oh wow, thats actually good
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:09:19 double sided tree emoji idk lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:12:54 it floats tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:13:02 sad
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:23:38 its time for f14 canopy <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:23:56 im not good at designing canopy glass
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 18:45:14 I literally just got done collecting the items

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 19:06:08 This uhm f14 canopy is giving me a mental breakdown
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 19:39:16 do i just start the canopy here
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 22:30:38 Are most f14‚Äôs 3 wide or 2?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 22:34:26 If I wanna make mine 3 wide do I need to make it longer? Cuz if yes I might keep it 2 wide
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 08:53:55 ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 09:31:18 Hmm angle locking, can you only angle lock up and down or why can‚Äôt i angle lock sideways
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 10:55:48 Good or bad canopy shape for f14
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 11:07:13 ehh i dont think im keeping this canopy
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 11:49:14 There isn‚Äôt a single PvP server where if I spawn in to test motorlock I don‚Äôt get obliterated by camping tutorial tanks

plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:06:44 atleast its not a 150 motors motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:10:02 Is it like this F14?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:11:46 This is the f14
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:19:54 angled canopy isnt my thing

plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:23:46 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:26:16 And so did the 2nd YouTube video picture I sent
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:28:32 How about you go to the YouTube video and start at 4:05 and watch till 5:35
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:28:38 And you‚Äôll see
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:29:01 Cuz he didn‚Äôt angle anything yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:30:07 You still haven‚Äôt watched the YouTube video it seems
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:30:46 You aren‚Äôt even apart of this so stfu
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:31:32 you only joined mig to act more cool and become more cool, but you‚Äôre not
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:32:09 Only because he saw some nose angles?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:33:07 I never thought 2 experts would be dumber than some whitenames
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:38:12 I mean, we play plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:38:33 Thats what you did too
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:39:53 You didn‚Äôt say anything to me before this so you inserted yourself
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:41:01 2 experts being too lazy to watch 1:30s of a video because they think the picture I showed isn‚Äôt the f14 in a thumbnail
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 13:58:21 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the white name‚Äù
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 14:29:22 good or bad f14 canopy
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 14:54:16 this canopy picture really giving me troubles as im not that good at angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 14:56:53 Level 3
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 15:28:25 god damn disconnector
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 15:33:13 Explosive block works too for the helium block stoppers
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 15:33:21 Ive never used springs tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 15:51:14 Are springs better than explosives? But springs might also get stuck right
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:07:43 Reach level 3
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:19:34 <@448677698773057547> are you a f14 expert?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:20:02 For canopy, do I make 3 different anglelock sections?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:20:54 I now have this üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:21:02 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:21:27 6/7 blocks too short?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:22:29 8 or 9 I can‚Äôt see if the last wedge is 1x2 or 1x3
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:23:54 I think canopy is going to be the hardest part for my f14 but even if it takes a week I‚Äôll still get it (hopefully)
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:26:55 For wings motor 2 right ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:27:47 What should be the max angle for wings on f14?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:27:53 40¬∞?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:28:25 Hmm okay
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:29:27 Should i maybe switch to 3 wide f14 to make canopy a little easier or is angle locking harder than
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:32:26 The hole in the exact center?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:32:33 Not exact but close
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 16:35:11 Gotta be like 8
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:10:37 do i make 2 seperate angle lock parts cuz theyre not even
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:11:00 (the custom wedge i made to make it 3 wide)
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:23:32 this nose is way better than 2 wide
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:30:38 round trail huh
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:31:15 mustve taken 100 anglelocked trails <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 17:51:57 dont tell me its a tutorial jet and also build backwards?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:03:14 canopy should go over the red right?
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:08:04 it allows take off faster tho <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:43:19 These custom canopy‚Äôs with angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:43:24 How do y‚Äôall hide the motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:43:29 Or where
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:51:59 Next week this f14 canopy is done
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 18:52:06 I have no idea how to make custom canopy‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:51:02 custom canopy's actually hard
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:51:28 angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:51:46 4 different parts
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:52:17 Custom canopy using 4 different angle locked glass
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:53:07 Reference picture of what I mean by ImHereForGam3
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:54:14 I can angle lock, but not 4 different parts
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:54:51 4 different parts I need to angle and lock them together I‚Äôve never done that
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:59:08 Where do I even put the motors? 2 blocks under the canopy to hide it in the body or where
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 20:42:43 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 20:42:47 I wanted to load my Apache
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 20:42:55 But I saved my mini f14 from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 20:42:59 now my Apache is gone
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 22:58:34 Pc 2 will release once all of us whitenames have expert
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 23:32:14 gta 6 vs pc2
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 23:32:31 Battle of who will never release
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:00:23 im gonna be stuck on f14 canopy for a while
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 18:51:01 how bad is this f14 nose and canopy (im too lazy for custom canopy and i absolutely suck)
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:14:48 goofy f14 bottom
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:18:31 Whitename without image perms acting like a expert hmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:19:23 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:19:28 Expert is better than a professional
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:19:48 Nah cuz I ain‚Äôt talking like da hood
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:20:17 Creations is roast your builds nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:20:47 I shall now make capybara

plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:26:22 due to this gap i shall now rebuild my f14
bot-central 2022-10-31 19:28:02 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:29:26 How big is your plot
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:29:34 50x50 or smth?
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:30:58 Hell nah why is my plot 51x51 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:31:01 Why not 50x50
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:31:37 51x51=2601 blocks I don‚Äôt have that many blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:32:07 Unless I use beams and blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:32:41 it‚Äôs time to build my build
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:32:45 it‚Äôs a secret
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:32:57 Okay nah
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:33:04 I wanted to make 51x51 capybara pixel art
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:33:35 It‚Äôs time to make capybara pixel art
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:34:23 How do you make images smaller
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:34:26 to pixel size
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:36:20 here we go lmao
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:36:49 Gonna have to use auto clicker to place blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:37:06 unless that‚Äôs illegal <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:38:33 Okay but I just realised this capybara image 51x51 is blurry
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:38:38 how am I gonna get the colors rigjt
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:39:07 But it‚Äôs for capybara pixel art I need expert
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:42:33 Placing 2000 blocks kinda boring
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:47:02 636 blocks left to place
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:47:06 Then 601 beams
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:49:07 Can‚Äôt I just get 1000 more blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:49:16 Would be easier to fill up 51x51 plot
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:54:37 Placing 601 beams 1x4 is harder than 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:54:39 <:kerrorRAGE:1021740719959965736>
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:55:56 3/4th done i think
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:56:29 This is torture
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 19:56:48 Alr <@370594904268734464>
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:38:19 Apparently auto save is broken and I lost this progress for my pixel art
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:38:43 After placing more than 2000 blocks why does the game think I did nothing and it didn‚Äôt save anything
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:41:10 I literally went to play rocket league i got disconnected for idling cuz I left my pc on
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:41:41 Maybe rickje should add auto save every minute
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:41:50 now I have to place 2601 blocks once again
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:42:52 He‚Äôs working on pc3 so when it‚Äôs done he can work on pc2 and not release pc3 till 2040
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:44:00 Is madattack even online in roblox or here I never see him
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 21:44:44 Madattack <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 16:39:07 its time for capybara pixel art
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 16:39:26 and yes i saved the 2601 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 16:58:11 2592 more blocks to paint
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 17:09:32 For my 51x51 pixel art I have to color pick 2601 pixels and put rgb in color too in pc
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 17:09:36 This will take long
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 12:50:06 Simple, don‚Äôt make it flip
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 10:05:57 F14
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 20:42:25 hmm steam locomotive
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 20:42:45 gear is from a tutorial <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 21:51:19 if i play 24/7 this weekend can i finish this 2601 blocks pixel art??
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 21:52:31 i mean maybe i can finish half cuz its gonna be a capybara which will motivate me
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 22:02:06 thinnest part for what? to hide smth aka make it float or what

plane-crazy 2022-11-06 12:27:10 r
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 12:28:00 because this doesnt look that good with these big cylinders
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 12:54:59 current progress on russian battleship <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 09:52:27 is this too low
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 22:46:20 If one trail touches your base blacklist him and he‚Äôll despawn
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 22:46:41 and then unblacklist him and repeat it till he rage quits
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 06:14:08 Why‚Äôd the downvote reaction get removed from this one creation

plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:23:33 how wide should this be
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:28:23 where the bow ends the straight part
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:39:36 Spitfire
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:40:40 how do i even start lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:46:00 but its a triangle bow, meaning i cant make it one block then start wedges, i now cant make proper turrets
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:46:30 3x3 turret layout which needs 5x5 cylinder but its gonna be off the middle
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:47:36 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:49:32 like this?
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:52:53 But you build your Alaska‚Äôs bow also out of wedges
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:54:07 I am on beginner level
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:55:50 I don‚Äôt even know how wide to make it so idk how to make the wedges cuz my last battleship it wasn‚Äôt wide enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:56:54 my old battleship which wasnt wide enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 21:06:50 I might make it 11 then cuz it‚Äôll be easier for turrets with a 5x5 cylinder aka the barbette
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 21:08:09 Though the roundness of the bow ends almost behind the conning tower
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 21:09:10 I think this bow might need angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 16:18:11 do i make the very front also custom angle locked
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 16:30:31 cringe bow
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 16:51:08 opinions?
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 16:53:05 That‚Äôs what I thought too but otherwise it‚Äôs gonna be too long maybe
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:02:03 how am i gonna build the deck and turrets conning tower etc tho when the whole bow is angle locked
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:08:41 Exactly what I‚Äôm doing rn thanks tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:17:29 maybe its too thin yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:18:12 its how the original ship is
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:18:16 triangle

plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:20:18 looks so goofy now
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:21:04 So back to the cutters ig
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:22:10 Nope 1x1 half wedge up, doesn‚Äôt take me 3 minutes to paint then
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:33:33 goofy stick thats on the front of the bow

plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:56:56 I know
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 17:56:57 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 10:37:35 is this a better bow?
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 10:45:29 this should do
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 11:17:19 eugh
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:08:16 how do i fold this for when i get to that part
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:20:52 I know how to fold Kaspa but this is a angle locked bow
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:22:02 And I don‚Äôt have any straight parts unless I shorten a part by 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:22:26 I guess I‚Äôm gonna need to do that
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:23:56 i can fold if i attach it to the white part but then i need to make the 2nd part higher up
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:43:19 Why wont this connect or is it not possible
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 20:43:39 connect to the control surface
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:03:11 ugh
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:04:47 1.25 distance in piston is 1 block right
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:05:45 I‚Äôm trying to piston lock like 0.3 blocks, but gotta learn it
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:05:54 For this to make it better a bit
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:16:50 got it
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:32:11 current progress before going to sleep, deck will be fixed tomorrow

plane-crazy 2022-11-11 21:34:41 WW2 battleship never build I believe
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 11:56:01 best i can do with the deck
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:05:42 liking it
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:15:58 is this any good?
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:23:45 turret done
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:30:59 like this or a tad lighter?
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:32:22 perfect?
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 12:32:49 just bucket it so barrels are yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:17:18 HMMM
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:17:45 Almost at the part that requires folding <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:24:45 can it move?
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:25:06 I mean you build something big that can‚Äôt move and is easy to hit
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:28:00 Bucket it
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:34:33 Happy with my ship so far, now it‚Äôs time for superstructure and folding soon
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 13:35:38 I think I will finish mine but maybe not cuz I also have 51x51 pixel art
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 14:00:17 This superstructure harder than i thought
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 14:08:09 goofy super structure ong
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 14:41:49 how to improve?

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 16:41:50 unless you really want single
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 16:42:25 Make sure the tender says LNER too then ;)

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 16:49:19 Did u even use motorlock for the build
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 16:50:04 Maybe just maybe a detailed interior with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 16:50:49 Such as idk tbh

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:21:10 <@727218792685633547> f16 nose is also angled
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:22:25 Under the canopy
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:24:33 use delta wings as theyre thicker
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:25:37 Also how u gonna attach a body to this as half or 3/4th base is used for the nose
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:26:38 does roblox have uwu faces
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:28:13 do i make this 1 longer or keep the intake 3 long

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:41:57 But it‚Äôs just intakes really for me already on Eurofighter
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:43:32 this on eurorfighter makes me not wanna build it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:44:32 It‚Äôs only 25 robux so probably a random maybe or someone who has 1000 spare
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:46:32 Oh wait yeah I had ptfs game tab open cuz it has f14 now
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:48:23 How am I gonna angle this f16 nose, I don‚Äôt even know where to start

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:55:51 It‚Äôs not mine
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:56:09 But that looks like it could be made with a couple motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:56:14 or even without almost
