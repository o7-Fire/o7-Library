creations-chat 2020-08-02 21:50:41 I'm gonna build an in ground missile silo but there was no ground that I could dig into. *Adapt. Improvise. Overcome*
creations-chat 2020-08-02 21:52:50 Because of how big it is I might build an entire military base up there
creations-chat 2020-08-02 22:55:04 I've made the silo door for the missile silo. I'm a slow worker
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:18:10 Typhoon i think
creations-chat 2020-08-03 00:00:20 Some dude took credit for another person's build
creations-chat 2020-08-03 00:00:44 And even when he was exposed **with evidence** he continued to deny it
creations-chat 2020-08-03 19:59:29 <@531042200017174539> why is the second image a screenshot of a discord image lol
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:00:57 Oh
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:01:03 No you don't need to
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:01:07 I was just wondering
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:48:45 Tutorials are against the rules to post there anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:49:38 Itâ€™s still against the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:50:45 Lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:52:27 The only kamikaze weapons that are acceptable in my eyes are well made Zeros and Goliath Tracked Mines
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:52:59 ^
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:53:46 I was pulling out the belt for that one
creations-chat 2020-08-03 22:55:28 Yeah thatâ€™s better
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 03:23:47 Just got out of a dogfight with a swarm of shredder bugs. Idk how I won lol because my plane was a dive bomber. Below are images which show the damages sustained during the fight.

creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:50:12 Why do we not have the option upvote this one?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:50:28 I mean I wasnâ€™t planning on doing it but Iâ€™m just confused
creations-chat 2020-08-17 00:40:33 Why are there no reactions on the posts in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-08-19 05:04:36 <@!568818354060787743> Make a mentos truck that collided with your tasti-cola truck to have a backstory to the explosion
creations-chat 2020-08-20 00:10:31 Just because itâ€™s named after pee pee poo poo doesnâ€™t instantly make it worthy of an upvote <@!273536574770380800>

creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:00:37 I know I am but what are youðŸ˜Ž
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:00:40 Wait
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:01:50 Itâ€™s not as annoying as people pinging you because they want to know why you downvoted their post
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:03:29 Yeah but the person that posted it shouldnâ€™t be pinging people because it was downvoted
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:04:14 If they wanted to give criticism then they should dm the person who posted it
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:04:27 I know why they ping
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:04:32 But doesnâ€™t mean they should do it
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:04:36 Itâ€™s really annoying
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:05:35 But I want to still receive notifications for important pings, and not some kid that is sad because somebody didnâ€™t like his post
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:06:41 Again, I want to receive pings if theyâ€™re important, but not salty kids that canâ€™t handle peopleâ€™s opinions
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:07:15 Itâ€™s not about not wanting pings
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:07:32 Itâ€™s about not wanting to have to explain to the kid why I donâ€™t like their build
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:07:58 Nice
creations-chat 2020-08-20 20:08:26 I like your use of hover thrusters for the headlights
creations-chat 2020-08-30 23:38:46 Ok I'm kinda dumb but how do I make a plane that's agile and doesn't require the whole map to turn 180Â°
creations-chat 2020-08-30 23:40:26 Is it better to place the control surfaces near the center of mass or away from it?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 23:41:19 What does enabling servo do?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 23:41:41 Oh alright

creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:36:27 Am I allowed to post something like this
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:36:31 Or will it get me warned
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:39:03 <@!449507213648592897> imagine self upvoting
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:44:17 Just let people downvote it naturally
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:44:47 I feel like when people say "downvote this" they say it so they have an excuse when their build gets hated on
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:16 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:25 I should make a list of those people
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:32 So people don't get on that list
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:47:39 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:47:47 Good idea
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:47:58 Although they aren't really breaking rules
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:48:12 So the admins can't really do something like that
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:48:25 Oh true
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:49:31 There should be a neutral button in between upvote and downvote so we can show those people that it's not that their post got ignored but we genuinely don't want to give them attention
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:50:03 Yeah it's a Toyota Supra
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:50:27 True
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:50:42 Shake my SMHing head
creations-chat 2020-09-08 20:03:24 Hm?

creations-chat 2020-09-23 18:36:46 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-23 18:38:30 All 3 of those pixels in that picture look great
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:07:18 So what does motor locking a bunch of cameras into your builds do because I've seen a few people doing it recently
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:07:54 Hm
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:08:27 But why so many cameras...
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:08:46 Oh
