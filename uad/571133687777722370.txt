plane-crazy 2020-10-17 00:15:31 All pvp starships should have 3 layers of armor
Ballasts, cutters facing the outside,
And normal.
general 2020-10-17 00:16:03 Funny
the-dump 2020-10-17 00:29:26 I HAD TO! I'M SORRY!
help 2020-10-17 00:36:32 Do Ballast Blocks do anything for defense?
help 2020-10-17 00:37:01 What about cutters?
help 2020-10-17 00:37:53 Nevermind, they can be used in conjunction to normal armor to slice any cutter bugs and the like.
