general 2023-02-21 15:50:28 please find "needs to be more than 1 engine": Thrust vectoring, also known as thrust vector control (TVC), is the ability of an aircraft, rocket, or other vehicle to manipulate the direction of the thrust from its engine (s) or motor (s) to control the attitude or angular velocity of the vehicle.
general 2023-02-21 15:52:07 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring#:~:text=Thrust%20vectoring%2C%20also%20known%20as%20thrust%20vector%20control,the%20attitude%20or%20angular%20velocity%20of%20the%20vehicle please find where it says it needs to be more than 1 engine
general 2023-02-21 15:53:53 also most modern rockets (the space kind) uses thrust vectoring, even with 1 engine: https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.d308baacff6fe936d9a3414351e2a670?rik=3wlciMD8O%2b6WQA&riu=http%3a%2f%2faeronotes.weebly.com%2fuploads%2f2%2f5%2f3%2f7%2f25370889%2f7089805_orig.png&ehk=J9CYyroZsRcMw1UxYR6jnmGuKlJrxGhhBdmHSROrN7Q%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0

He shakes the thugs for money, once I think I saw him shake a bunny.
Sometimes he shakes me other times he fakes me.
He is very shady I do not know if he's a lady.
My mother makes him shake pies at least it's better than him shaking guys.

creations-chat 2023-07-14 19:53:41 the tail wings and any parts that dont really matter are done lazy
creations-chat 2023-07-14 19:57:02 this was mostly just a test bed to test hypermanuvrability at 2k+ speeds, redundancy, trimming, and reducing sliping without thrust vectoring.
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:01:53 im trying to develop the techonlogys so i can out tryhard the tryhard, without trying hard
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:12:06 the cherry on top is it requires mouse and a remapped flight stick to fly optimaly
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:28:27 ok in a dive the wings can handle up to 4k speed before they start to slip when pulling up 90 deg, so i can realistically double the speed, the only issue is i would need 3-4 times torque the current engines output to keep the insane acceleration (torque does not equal speed)
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:51:14 i dont make things that look good, i make things that kill good
