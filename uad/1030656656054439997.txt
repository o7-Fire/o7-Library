creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:01:36 f-35 in modern aerial combat is unironically better, as its still stealth and can carry more missiles, dogfighting doesnt matter that much anymore
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:05:28 it is that simple, in the age of missiles that can reach over the horizon all that matters is who has the most missiles, who detects the other guy first, and being lucky enough that your countermeasures and evasive manuevers work, jet dogfights almost never happen in modern aerial warfare
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:12:48 AIM-120D, AIM-260 JATM, R-37M, PL-21, KS-172 for example
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:18:13 yeah, which is why sweden should make a stealth gripen c to finally produce the best fighter jet ever
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:20:34 gripen c pretty baller idk, if they made a stealth version of it that had equivalent stealth tech it'd probably be more stealth than the f-35 just due to it's size (even smaller radar cross section)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:24:56 i found one guy on the internet that says its already kinda stealth https://www.quora.com/Is-Gripen-E-stealth, idk bro
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:28:05 a valid source of course
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:30:30 no i was being ironic inbetween 2 minute chat cooldown while looking for solid info
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:39:41 ok so i couldnt find shit on the gripen's radar cross section that wasnt from some random dude on the internet, so i will now assume its probably shitty due to only being able to mount weapons on it externally, it seems that the gripen E would be the only variant that could possibly "fight" US aircraft (get a missile off) due to it's supposedly pretty good radar that i cant find any info on within 5 minutes
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:42:07 yeah if your radar cross section is larger than a golf ball you arent stealth, but the gripen production and maintenance costs are still pretty based and redpilled for what you get, its just shit against stealth aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:44:38 no
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:47:40 depends how big the marble is, theres billiard ball sized marbles
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:51:42 oh yeah i almost forgot about heat, imagine making your aircraft invisible to radar only to have it get taken out by a cold war era heat seeker
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:07:00 radar cant pick up infrared, also infrared is light so an enemy jet probably couldnt detect you beyond visual range by infrared, so its probably not that big of a deal in terms of air to air
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:13:10 it still cant see over the horizon (infrared is light)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:20:46 interesting, kinda vague on how it works though

general 2022-12-02 02:26:44 post it
general 2022-12-02 02:26:58 wait is it the one where the upper half gets stuck in the landing gear for a bit then falls out
general 2022-12-02 02:27:46 yeah, the video clip i saw only included the landing gear touching down then a deer getting mostly vaporized
general 2022-12-02 02:28:01 it was epic
general 2022-12-02 02:28:11 the deer got vaporized
general 2022-12-02 02:28:47 then the upper fourth or something fell out of the landing gear like a few seconds after explosion
general 2022-12-02 02:29:59 world hunger is based, shut up
general 2022-12-02 02:30:36 the video im referring to is landing gear vs runway deer
general 2022-12-02 02:31:13 after a review it turns out the part that got stuck in the landing gear was just the head
general 2022-12-02 05:26:19 just gonna reach in and grab a liver

creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:46:48 
creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:49:26 fact, i've improved it alot since then and it looks more drippy, i should repost the new version and see what happens
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:17:42 i posted the new version of my propfighter and INSTANTLY some dude downvotes it, a bit suspect
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:23:13 
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:28:37 you got 90 votes on simple pixel art and 13 dislikes, 94 likes 24 dislikes on a barebones suspension car, then 252 likes 11 dislikes on a plane that is supposedly "built for functionality not looks" (it obviously isnt for functionality entirely as you gave it a airframe and various other decorations), then i post an ok looking aircraft with good functionality and it gets INSTANTLY by some dude within half a second then immediately disliked, a tad sussy
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:32:17 doing a real good job at ignoring the point
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:34:43 no my bad i did mention those, thought it was the other screenshot chain
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:41:07 seems as though people in this server simply have high standards for what classifies as an ok build at first, then i see some simple pixel art get 90 upvotes 13 downvotes and a barebones purple suspension car get almost the same amount
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:44:49 i pointed out something i thought was sussy (some guy downvotes within the half second reactions are available) and you lost it lol, i wasnt complaining about my build being downvoted in the first place
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:47:16 you said "its just shit" then i pulled out your three builds of less or equal quality (unless you argue about the effort put into the "airframe" on the plane one)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:50:41 my plane only looks ok in terms of looks, but it most certainly has more interesting functionality than pixel art and better looks than a barebones purple suspension car
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:52:57 either i need to post my builds during certain times (different parts of the community are in different timezones thus different standards at certain times) or theres something sussy amiss
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:55:38 look closer, its definetly not the exact same
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:58:54 yeah, thus ok cause i had to extend out the prop so i could motorlock propblades into eachother to get 2x thrust for speed (it was a bit too slow), it'd look alot better if i could phase them into the nose of the prop better
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:01:13 havent seen it flying before, but you should try to hide the wings and control surface wings inside blocks, try to make the control surface gaps as hard to see as possible (in the case of servo control surfaces)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:05:02 yeah it looks pretty good, but then you see the control surfaces, to avoid needing wide gaps around the control surfaces you can motorlock them downwards into place, use round ins to unobstruct the front part of the control surface
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:30:50 rate his build

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:50:01 probably idk
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:51:28 usually i put the cockpit backwards then the engine ontop

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:57:45 no not really
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:59:15 the wing ends are the vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:00:22 they should cut it out with all this vertical stabilizer stuff and just use thrust vectoring

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:02:05 it'd make sense if they made a wacky rapier engine so they could send this thing into space (less wing weight and drag)

plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:07:27 motorlock it inwards
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:07:56 fake prop plane then
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:15:03 do keep in mind the actual prop size, the image you were going off of makes it look small from the angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:17:01 the diagram!!! use it!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:17:32 yeah the front one
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:17:46 it looks like you should just motorlock the whole engine forward by .5 though
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:18:09 motorlock it NOW
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:18:28 MOT O LOC!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:18:54 you WILL MOTOR LOCK IT
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:21:25 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:21:28 i am satisified
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:21:49 wait no use the one on the left
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:22:48 nevermind use the one on the right its supposed to stick out that much
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:23:11 put the wing one block out then motorlock it in so you dont have to worry about welds

plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:34:18 maybe in ohio üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:34:53 also do consider that you may have to motorlock a few wings into the cockpit for stability later on
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:35:19 it probably wont need the cockpit wings though
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:35:43 the dark green one looks good though
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:36:33 have you considered that germans put different camoflauges on their plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:36:43 it could be that color or it could be gray and yellow
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:36:49 they had alot of camoflauges that they'd put on planes
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:37:05 no way, he found it
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:37:34 paint more of it that color
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:40:00 yeah that green doesnt look very good
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:40:29 its too white
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:40:50 its not camoflauage if it makes you look like a flashlight
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:41:15 yeah i guess that could work
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:41:22 as the second part of the camo
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:42:02 give it a working propeller
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:42:51 no angle, doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:43:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:43:44 look, the engine wasnt that perfectly aerodynamic, it was one of those ugly radial ones, you could probably sneak some motorlock into the prop and get away with it
creations-chat 2022-12-12 23:30:40 its pretty good with exception of the prop but knowing how shit goes in <#384025409945337856> it'll probably get downvote spammed

general 2022-12-18 23:49:37 ok a few do have about the same as the ship, but the ship is still really good shit and this doesnt justify not credditing

general 2022-12-18 23:53:55 very true, as a professional aircraft eyeballer that has made plenty high quality aircrafts by eyeballing i can confirm that this could work if the center of mass was moved forward sufficiently (it probably will be after the cockpit is finished and a few dense parts are put in it)

creations-chat 2023-01-01 07:40:32 it would technically work without it atleast to an extent where a crash isnt guaranteed, computer systems would just compensate for the horrendous constant center of drag and lift shifting and possibly save you from crashing due to a single engine failure, but this plane has too many flaws to ever be practical so it doesnt matter

general 2023-01-03 01:43:42 thats not spelling thats grammar
general 2023-01-03 01:43:57 you're an unde trying to look smart with an attempt at proper grammar
general 2023-01-03 01:44:20 you shouldnt have capitalized the no or added a period here as it is not a sentence
general 2023-01-03 01:44:31 not a unde is not a sentence either
general 2023-01-03 01:45:13 capitalizing words and throwing periods around doesnt make you look smart it infact does the opposite
general 2023-01-03 01:45:56 when he wants it to what? <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-03 01:46:51 surely mangos perhaps?
general 2023-01-03 01:47:10 maybe
creations-chat 2023-01-03 01:48:31 1 wide airliner
general 2023-01-03 01:49:18 on time i saw someone make a 3x5 flying thing and unironically say its a f-14
general 2023-01-03 01:49:53 it also went like 50 sps or less
general 2023-01-03 01:51:19 true, too many boomers took their grandchildren to see topgun 2
general 2023-01-03 01:52:49 beyblade plane
general 2023-01-03 01:54:06 do it in israel
general 2023-01-03 01:55:20 just make it a big wedge on a spinning stick attached to a spring
general 2023-01-03 01:55:26 then put a green trail on the spring to indicate proximity
general 2023-01-03 01:56:09 the 2 gallon jug of chloroform in my basement:
general 2023-01-03 01:56:50 you wanna remove that h?
general 2023-01-03 01:57:44 exactly this
general 2023-01-03 01:58:18 its a dumb child trying to sound smart in hopes that someone will hit him with the "O EM GEE THATS AWESOME!!! YOU'RE SO SMART!!!!"
general 2023-01-03 01:59:26 yeah i just took a look at the image
general 2023-01-03 01:59:36 its just the same thing as the wedge on a stick concept
general 2023-01-03 01:59:42 but with a hoverengine to provide force instead
general 2023-01-03 01:59:48 he said it was a fucking working radar
general 2023-01-03 01:59:53 he said functional multiple times specifically
general 2023-01-03 02:00:46 warthunder players in 2077 instantly recognizing the timetravelling poopfartass panzerwagon
general 2023-01-03 02:01:37 hey baby i rocket snipe with swordfish
general 2023-01-03 02:02:03 its literally just a spinning suspension with a hover engine on it
general 2023-01-03 02:02:23 it turns out hover engines can repel off of players
general 2023-01-03 02:02:46 and he thought to himself: "ITS A PLAYER TRACKING RADAR!!!"
general 2023-01-03 02:03:02 that was just a load of dumb shit lol
general 2023-01-03 02:03:14 the closest thing you can get to gas in plane crazy is magnet balls in a magnet box
general 2023-01-03 02:03:52 its not gas, as it cannot physically interact with anything
general 2023-01-03 02:06:00 it isnt
general 2023-01-03 02:06:10 mid 2023
general 2023-01-03 02:06:26 its already summer in texas
general 2023-01-03 02:06:29 where is it
general 2023-01-03 02:07:12 im excited for wings that calculate lift instead of just drag
general 2023-01-03 02:07:55 oh yeah he did say that
general 2023-01-03 02:08:02 that means they probably calculate lift
general 2023-01-03 02:09:12 no they dont üóø
general 2023-01-03 02:09:20 wings in pc only have drag
general 2023-01-03 02:09:33 thers no lift its just drag
general 2023-01-03 02:09:39 the blades are angled
general 2023-01-03 02:09:44 or the blades are fake and theres rocket engine spam under them
general 2023-01-03 02:10:00 it creates drag
general 2023-01-03 02:10:03 in the upwards direction
general 2023-01-03 02:10:08 its pseudo lift
general 2023-01-03 02:10:39 i made it up
general 2023-01-03 02:10:54 drag enacting an upwards force
general 2023-01-03 02:11:41 the wings in pc2 create lift (upwards force) while going completely straight at a completely level angle
general 2023-01-03 02:11:47 cause they work more like actual wings
general 2023-01-03 02:11:55 which dont rely on drag but rather lift
general 2023-01-03 02:12:16 no thats just drag creating the exact same thing but not in the same way
general 2023-01-03 02:13:12 those are strong words for someone with that pfp
general 2023-01-03 02:13:47 real wings split the airflow to create upwards force while moving straight (they create a vacuum on the upper half of the wing and high pressure on the lower half of the wing)
general 2023-01-03 02:15:09 cause its creating drag rather than lift
general 2023-01-03 02:15:17 real wings dont need to increase AoA to generate upwards force
general 2023-01-03 02:15:37 depends on what
general 2023-01-03 02:16:15 true!!!
general 2023-01-03 02:19:27 exactly
general 2023-01-03 02:19:34 it only creates upwards drag
general 2023-01-03 02:19:37 no lift on it's own
general 2023-01-03 02:19:57 no
general 2023-01-03 02:21:18 i was saying cardboard rectangles only create upward drag, theres no lift created by their shape
general 2023-01-03 02:22:40 drag is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion, lift is created by differences in air pressure
general 2023-01-03 02:25:26 the word "roscale" on the post of a vehicle in creations is one of the variables that contributes to making me downvote it
general 2023-01-03 02:26:23 yeah no shit thats what i said
general 2023-01-03 02:26:28 go google it nerd
general 2023-01-03 02:26:56 yeah then i googled it
general 2023-01-03 02:28:14 lift is the upwards force generated by air pressure differences, drag is the air resistance
general 2023-01-03 02:29:10 it means they can glide
general 2023-01-03 02:29:36 its cause he said so
general 2023-01-03 02:29:46 NO
general 2023-01-03 02:29:54 low pressure air ontop high pressure air below
general 2023-01-03 02:29:57 idiot
general 2023-01-03 02:29:59 smh smh
general 2023-01-03 02:30:06 i cannot BELIEVE you made tihs mistake i am FUMING
general 2023-01-03 02:30:40 it racially segregates the air into high pressure and low pressure
general 2023-01-03 02:30:42 and the low pressure goes ontop
general 2023-01-03 02:30:48 the high pressure fucks off to the bottom
general 2023-01-03 02:31:54 everytime i see some variation of this question i want to crush the windpipe of the person asking the question
general 2023-01-03 02:32:23 thats when the wings are going fast
general 2023-01-03 02:32:33 the wings are just equally sexist and tell ALL the air to fuck off after flaming it
general 2023-01-03 02:32:45 however this is only when it goes mach 5 and above
general 2023-01-03 02:33:35 no its the nose of the plane i think
general 2023-01-03 02:33:42 the plane is pretty much just flying off of drag at that point
general 2023-01-03 02:34:00 but the airflow is being deflected away from alot of the plane so theres not too much drag
general 2023-01-03 02:34:38 tldr
general 2023-01-03 02:36:08 ingame wings resist momentum based on orientation, velocity, and direction of momentum, not by slamming into a gas
general 2023-01-03 02:36:19 its just simulated drag
general 2023-01-03 02:37:07 the wings flap and that makes them go up
general 2023-01-03 02:37:39 no its just to prove you wrong
general 2023-01-03 02:38:39 he wants to be pissed on and embarassed by being proven wrong, hes a sussy baka
general 2023-01-03 02:40:32 shittiest logic ever
general 2023-01-03 02:41:41 its just a hover engine on a suspension
general 2023-01-03 02:41:55 the hover engine pushes off of players standing right next to it
general 2023-01-03 02:41:57 show us it then
general 2023-01-03 02:42:31 yeah, the hover engine pushes off of the player standing infront of it and thus pushes the suspension
general 2023-01-03 02:43:02 all the engines ingame break the laws of physics
general 2023-01-03 02:43:27 all of them create infinite energy (this violation they all share in common)
general 2023-01-03 02:43:48 with the exception of the fuel option
general 2023-01-03 02:43:57 but even then you can put them in a box and turn them on and they'll still give thrust
general 2023-01-03 02:44:05 so they're still in violation of the laws of physics
general 2023-01-03 02:45:27 if there is no way to do something then it is impossible to do that thing
general 2023-01-03 02:46:11 i wasnt talking about a mustang
general 2023-01-03 02:46:14 or any sort of plane or car
general 2023-01-03 02:46:46 the box shouldnt move
general 2023-01-03 02:47:07 by thrust i meant the box gaining directional thrust as a result of the engine being on
general 2023-01-03 02:48:12 what is this thing üíÄ
general 2023-01-03 02:49:00 this is the main thing preventing it from detecting shit practically
general 2023-01-03 02:49:08 the other thing is that hover engines use a raycast
general 2023-01-03 02:49:33 you'd have to point it exactly at the hidden object that could be thousands of studs away
general 2023-01-03 02:49:57 what was this guy's shit creation
general 2023-01-03 02:50:07 before his alt gets banned
general 2023-01-03 02:50:22 who the hell is died
general 2023-01-03 02:50:52 f
general 2023-01-03 02:51:27 the only person being annoyed in <#497142796961054721> by people stating facts is you
general 2023-01-03 02:52:13 poor desperate child
general 2023-01-03 02:52:30 hello post the evidence in a completely public chat
general 2023-01-03 02:53:30 exactly the same thing
general 2023-01-03 02:53:44 a white name is a white name
general 2023-01-03 02:54:25 then post them again
general 2023-01-03 02:55:54 ok i just went through the messages that include radar in his chatlogs
general 2023-01-03 02:56:15 only three have pictures attached and none prove that it functions beyond 5 blocks
general 2023-01-03 02:58:15 whitename is white name without a space
general 2023-01-03 02:59:05 stop trying to stick random ass definitions to "white name" in a desperate attempt to not be wrong
general 2023-01-03 02:59:27 there were only 50 results
general 2023-01-03 02:59:31 oh lol
general 2023-01-03 02:59:45 yet none of this proves it actually tracks anything
general 2023-01-03 02:59:55 or if it can track further than 5 blocks
general 2023-01-03 02:59:59 its just a box with pistons in it as far as we know
general 2023-01-03 03:03:59 the most basic form of a radar just detects position
general 2023-01-03 03:04:35 so you're saying that its tracking nothing? and thus the position indicator is fake
general 2023-01-03 03:04:48 post it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:05:01 just post it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:05:07 this
general 2023-01-03 03:05:33 if it works so well and fine at a practical range then post it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:06:16 why not do it now
general 2023-01-03 03:06:18 hm???
general 2023-01-03 03:06:30 why not post it right now
general 2023-01-03 03:06:35 surely you have a save of the radar
general 2023-01-03 03:06:58 ^
general 2023-01-03 03:07:02 he doesnt have a functional radar
general 2023-01-03 03:07:04 no proof
general 2023-01-03 03:07:33 not if theres a video of it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:07:34 lmao
general 2023-01-03 03:07:39 no proof
general 2023-01-03 03:08:42 "uhmmm MAKE IT FOR ME INSTEAD OF ME POSTING PROOF!!"
general 2023-01-03 03:09:24 little bro all you've got to do is post it lmao
general 2023-01-03 03:09:32 post a video of it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:10:13 if you're so worried about people other than you making it then why are you telling other people to make it
general 2023-01-03 03:10:30 also there'll always be plenty of chatlogs with dates attached to them to prove you made it first
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:12:06 theres no video evidence, its just a box with a moving red object in it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:12:32 he keeps throwing out bullshit excuses to not post video evidence
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:12:55 he just absolutely WILL NOT post any video evidence that he has a functional radar
general 2023-01-03 03:14:57 later meaning sometime between now and the end of time
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:15:30 yeah
general 2023-01-03 03:19:56 maybe 10 hours, maybe 10 years, maybe next century
general 2023-01-03 03:21:03 hes calling up his big bro for suggestions on how to get out of the situation
general 2023-01-03 03:21:18 the ancient arts of the chakra
general 2023-01-03 03:22:33 hes summoning up the infinity stones to get it into operation
general 2023-01-03 03:22:43 thats why hes taking so long
general 2023-01-03 03:23:52 he posted literally that earlier
general 2023-01-03 03:23:54 yeah
general 2023-01-03 03:23:57 someone walks into it
general 2023-01-03 03:24:00 but it only works for like 3 blocks range
general 2023-01-03 03:24:05 yeah
general 2023-01-03 03:24:15 then he started acting like he made something better than that
general 2023-01-03 03:24:19 after we all collectively shit on him
general 2023-01-03 03:24:32 up untill now and continuing hes just been spewing shit
general 2023-01-03 03:24:57 how is this evidence
general 2023-01-03 03:25:20 you dont need to
general 2023-01-03 03:25:25 you just need to show it actively tracking something
general 2023-01-03 03:25:37 you need to show something outside of it moving and the red thing on the screen following
general 2023-01-03 03:25:52 but clearly all this is is just a trap door with a red block behind it
general 2023-01-03 03:26:19 "you want proof?? yeah well it works cause i say it does"
general 2023-01-03 03:27:08 its not even a piston block, its just a panel with a red spot on it that swings to the right
general 2023-01-03 03:27:26 i just now noticed the motor in the back
general 2023-01-03 03:27:57 it looks like he just had it set to go slow
general 2023-01-03 03:28:18 yeah cause it actually detects things within a range üíÄ
general 2023-01-03 03:29:16 if it legitimately worked then he'd post a video of it tracking a moving vehicle
general 2023-01-03 03:29:45 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-01-03 03:30:01 you dont even need to take the cover off to prove it works
general 2023-01-03 03:31:34 he just stopped talking
general 2023-01-03 03:31:50 hes back
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:32:24 yeah cause you can clearly see the motor in the back and a panel swinging to display a red block üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:32:37 also you never show it tracking anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:33:30 if you look through the left corner of the "screen" you can see the motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:33:38 its just a slowly swingly panel with a red block on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:33:58 he uses the excuse "i didnt press anything!!!" in attempt to prove it wasnt player operated
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:34:08 but he could've just started the motor right before recording
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:34:26 or used a physics actuated hinge
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:34:51 read the chat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:35:09 dont think im gonna let you get away with ignoring counterarguments conveniently
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:35:20 that motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:35:30 it doesnt detect anything except a button input from the user
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:35:57 he just turned on a slow motor to swing a panel with a red block before recording
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:36:27 if its a camera stick then its not a radar
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:10 yes, and those are very short range
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:40 yes, clearly better than the black box he built
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:13 i never asked why it was black
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:22 seems like you're now trying to change the topic
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:24 very sad
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:34 thats a hover engine on a suspension
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:43 thats not a practical radar
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:59 it doesnt matter if it detects a block or not
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:40:12 the range is so horrendously short that it would never work practically
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:40:57 the guy with the hammer is coming
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:41:38 yeah he just switched the shit out of the topic, as you all know his radar is bs and doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:41:46 argument concluded
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:42:18 all hes done today is attempt to make himself look smart and failed horrendously
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:42:30 then post actual evidence
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:42:53 the radar tracking a moving object
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:05 the moving object and the radar display being on screen simultaneously
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:47 you zooming in the camera to the display to the point where we cant see anything but the box doesnt prove that its tracking a moving object
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:50 just that the display can move
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:56 you only need one phone to record
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:57 zoom out
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:44:09 or you could always just take the cover off
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:44:33 it wont matter, everyone on the disc would know you made it first
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:44:51 "and also to make it track"
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:44:55 very goofy
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:45:01 yeah this lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:45:46 hes just throwing out random bullshit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:05 just give us a video of it fully working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:12 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:17 its just fake bs
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:27 hes an unde trying to make himself look smart
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:45 but his whole "i can make a radar!!" thing backfired on him
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:47:10 he was already trying to make himself look smart earlier with a flawed attempet at grammar and random bs
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:48:20 we arent asking for that
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:48:25 we're asking for proof that it even tracks at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:50:16 its literally just a motor you're controlling
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:50:30 we dont believe you cause you havent shown how it works or showed it actually working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:50:51 you could've just turned on a slow motor before recording
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:51:22 i watched the motor, and noticed it was just a very slow motor with a panel on it that has a red block
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:51:35 we'll believe you if you give us an actual video of it working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:13 yeah its literally just a motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:19 you can see the motor attached to the panel in the back
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:44 he could've set a slow motor with a magnet arm outside of the box to swing into place to attract the panel if he wanted more time to start recording
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:54:11 hes gone silent
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:54:14 its fake lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:54:35 prove it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:54:43 its not hard to give us a video
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:55:11 yes, with the motor assembly in the back it could never move upwards
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:55:20 unless the up motor is inside the panel
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:55:42 which will be never
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:55:52 and all we have for that is your word
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:06 also from the motor assembly visible its very plausible that it doesnt even move up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:12 LOL
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:21 yeah, you'll never post it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:41 you're just hoping to leave this without everyone collectively saying its fake before you leave the conversation
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:53 you're now just making up bullshit excuses to avoid posting it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:59 hes not going to, its fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:57:19 hes not gonna dig his own grave the whole 6 feet then put the nails in his own coffin
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:57:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:57:54 all hes being throwing around is shit logic, bullshit, and tricks
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:58:12 lmao he realized how shit his argument was
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:58:21 come on post it again little bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:58:48 next time an unde posts a paragraph im gonna screenshot it immediately
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:59:07 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:59:44 stop throwing around bullshit logic and just show us your radar working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:00 also the componets that make it work are actually visible in the picture, which makes this argument even more dogshit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:02 LOL
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:16 OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT SHOWING IT, its FAKE
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:25 lmao running
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:26 hes running
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:41 get out of here you beating worthy child
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:00:53 never*
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:01:04 hes just gonna go to sleep
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:01:18 now hes trying to make us look like basement dwellers
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:01:28 i bet thats your bedtime isnt it little bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:02:11 fakest ass radar ever
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:02:22 we arent screaming at you that its impossible
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:02:31 we're asking for proof that it works, perhaps a picture of how it works
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:02:42 its just a motor swinging a red block into place lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:02:54 more random bullshit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:03:15 record it actively tracking something this time
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:03:24 or better yet, give us a breakdown of how it works
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:03:30 give us inside and outside perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:04:27 hes supposedly recording at the moment, stop talking
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:04:30 give him a minute or two
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:06:49 minute or two is up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:07:14 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:08:03 ship fans watching me vaporize their "op battleship!!!" with one rocket barrage
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:08:43 stupid water float brick
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:09:29 turret fans watching me rocket snipe them (based cockpit aim)
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:15 once again, no exterior perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:22 wheres the exterior perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:29 no shit we need
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:37 i can see that its just a basic turret motor assembly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:42 it can just be a car passing
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:10:54 theres no outside perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:11:00 we dont see if its actually tracking anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:11:11 we just see the "display" move
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:12:07 oh so it cant track? thus it doesnt work?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:12:26 wait a second
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:12:41 LMAO HES OPERATING THE MOTORS ON HIS ALT
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:13:28 remember?? the radar structure was white in the car picture
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:14:13 caught in 40k
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:14:31 he has two different phones
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:14:50 he just used the other phone that has the "radar" save on it to control it while the alt that doesnt was recording from the display
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:15:12 are you reading what im saying
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:15:25 he fucked up big time on the "the buttons arent lighting up!!" argument
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:16:01 he caught himself in 40k
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:17:57 bro running
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:17:59 yeah its fake lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:18:03 yeah we can
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:18:30 we pointed out that it doesnt point in whats supposedly the correct direction
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:18:38 we pointed out that you could've just used an alt to control the motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:19:13 you refuse to provide any evidence of it working or explanation on how it works
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:20:34 you can just tell us the basic componets
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:20:47 what it uses to get the input most importantly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:20:55 what does angle lock have to do with this
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:21:14 little bro is trying to bullshit and topic change his way out of this
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:22:06 very easily
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:22:20 im not gonna google translate all that shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:22:30 just post proof that the radar actually works
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:23:20 lmao, no its just that you absolutely refuse to explain how it works and refuse to show any solid evidence of it working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:23:46 very sussy evidence that is most likely fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:34 you never show what its detecting
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:39 absolutely no exterior perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:51 you just show a display moving on a simple turret motor assembly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:59 we have plenty of reason to say its fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:25:03 stop trying to bullshit and topic change
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:25:36 show us how it works or show us it actually working
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:27:11 also the plot with the "radar" on it is white
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:27:21 thus showing that you have two accounts
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:27:24 that you can use at the same time
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:27:35 thus you can just use the one that doesnt own the radar save to record the display
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:27:42 then use the other one at the same time to control the display
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:28:07 yes he has two phones
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:28:14 atleast two phones that is
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:29:03 you never said
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:30:51 it doesnt work lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:31:02 he is indeed a kid and stupid
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:31:39 you're a donut earther
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:31:51 you're just throwing out random bullshit with no  meaningful proof
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:32:17 bro decided to be square üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:32:54 i bet hes a straight f student
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:33:32 all hes been doing today is desperately trying to make himself look smart
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:33:44 he just overdid it with the radar and it backfired on him
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:33:51 now hes triyng to dumbass and bullshit his way out
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:34:20 i've operated a servo through a microcontroller before
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:34:22 which classifies as a robot
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:34:48 spot on
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:35:07 yeah his parents bought him an arduino kit lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:35:20 i've used that kit before, its nothing difficult
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:35:32 its just basic circuitry and instructions on how to use a microcontroller
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:36:33 translate that to something comprehensible please
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:37:01 this doesnt explain why you arent playing minecraft rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:37:34 what does this have to do with you not playing minecraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:37:40 nobody gives a shit what OS your computer uses
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:37:53 if its your logic then its just magic bullshit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:38:36 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:38:42 yeah this guy is just a dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:39:20 hes just randomly thrown out "i use linux!!!" and "im doing something on terminal!!!" in attempt to look smart
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:39:33 we've looked at all the details there is, and its fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:39:53 lets all just collectively stop talking to this child and let him rot in his shame
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:40:16 we all know it doesnt work for shit and he never brings up any proof or sound logic, lets just cut the line right here and stop talking to him
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:30 hes just been spewing bullshit, using dogshit logic, comparing people to idiots, and never giving any solid proof
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:52 some unde made a fake radar and spent 2 hours just now trying to use bullshit logic and shit to say it was real
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:01 it doesnt work, it runs off of 2 motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:14 its just a basic display controlled by an alt
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:42 hover engine can supposedly, but only for a few blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:43:33 or the human could just be me, im built different
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:43:54 im ex minecraft special forces
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:43:58 i would definetly win
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:44:52 the lifespan of a human is like 5 times longer
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:44:59 he will outlive the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:03 the cow will die and he will live
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:07 hes beat the system, hes won
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:29 he just walks up to it and takes a shit on it's corpse
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:46:17 you could also just dig out the roots by hand if you didnt have access to tools
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:46:28 aint nobody gives a shit that you speak taco
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:46:50 real
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:47:06 very sad
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:47:29 i could just eat the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:47:48 not if i eat it first
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:28 im one of the guys that punches the cows to death to obtain burger
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:39 i can confirm you can just eat the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:18 just sidestep the cow repeatedly untill it collapses from exhaustion
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:23 then get it in a chokehold
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:50 the neck sticks all the way out there i bet i could
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:54 i have long arms
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:50:21 unless you're a midget you can pull off this strat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:50:36 this happens with bulls all the time what are you going on about
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:51:22 just keep sidestepping the cow untill it happens
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:02 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:38 a human cant break a cow's neck you rhetard
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:40 anyways
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:48 just keep sidestepping the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:54 true not barehanded
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:01 yes im superhuman i dont fall into this category
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:41 cows are just a fuckton of muscle without the capability to sweat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:57 if you just keep sidestepping the cow it'll get exhausted and worn out alot faster than you will
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:54:50 the only winning move is to sidestep the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:27 rko the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:46 anime type shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:53 you'd have to be a shaolin monk or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:34 <@695983848575598664> you can just sidestep the cow untill its too exhausted to run, then run off to go improvise a weapon
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:55 since you're so skeptical of the cow chokehold strat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:01 yeah i can
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:08 less than a human's
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:13 by using my legs
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:33 professional cow sidestepper
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:45 cows weigh thousands of pounds, they cant turn that fast once they've picked up momentum
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:50 just sidestep
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:02 i know the physical limitations of a human
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:17 you definitely are not the definition of the limitations of a human
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:36 no you can just sidestep the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:42 dive out of the cow's way
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:45 ez
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:03 he thinks skinny basement gamer arms are peak human
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:16 not if i sidestep them faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:47 just sidestep them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:57 do the elden ring roll
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:06:58 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:50 his best move is to sidestep the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:53 theres no other way
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:08:17 cow cowtermeasures
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:09:37 deploying eclairs
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:03 hes being challenged
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:13 activate your star sign
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:26 hes also going to do it with NO other equipment
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:28 hes going in ass naked
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:38 its gonna be peak masculinity display
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:55 its a rite of passage
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:10 hes doing some african oogachaka shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:34 just dig a hole under the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:19 just crouch he wont see you coming
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:38 if it was a peak human going up against a cow then you could literally just sidestep the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:44 and then get it in a chokehold
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:54 yes it can if you shoot it in the head
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:04 they do the exact same shit with high power air guns
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:07 and it works reliably
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:25 oh my gosh
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:31 you  absolute grass avoiders
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:39 if it was a peak human then he could literally just crush the cow's windpipe
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:21 there was a guy that deadass lifted 6,270 pounds
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:32 you could just crush it's fucking windpipe with your bare hands if you were a peak human
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:20:08 its not
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:20:38 this guy thinks the peak human is a basement dweller with stick arms, and thus cannot defeat a cow in hand to hand combat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:12 
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:17 we arent talking about bears
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:36 are we talking about the peak human or the average one
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:41 we're going off of biology in the wild
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:59 yeah well the average person isnt a caveman in the wilderness with no tools
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:22:27 the average cow is mass bred just to produce milk and steak
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:22:57 they arent going to be big muscled up bulls on steroids
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:23 im built different
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:36 yes i can
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:59 i dont have a basement
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:24:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:06 true just slice the tendons
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:33 dont give these chatlogs to the press
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:11 thousands of years of advancements have left cows weak as shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:42 you can just smack the cow with a rock
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:00 you're putting up an average modern day human against an average modern day cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:10 the cow is gonna be weak as shit and the human is gonna be able to bash it's knees in with a rock
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:36 no im eating it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:41 also thats a bull not a cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:46 we're talking about cows not bulls
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:08 hes too weak to use any of the strats we've given him
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:51 i've never seen a cow in one of those bull arena things where they sidestep the bull
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:30:19 cows aint built the same way they used to be
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:30:36 so true
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:01 in the modern age the average cow is a miserable thing bred to eat, produce milk, then get slaughtered within a second to make a burger out of
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:18 its  been like this for a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:22 the average cow is not going to be that strong
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:30 its gonna be a reddit mod's spirit animal
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:32:11 theres a reason why they never made a planet of the cows movie
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:32:20 even the dumbass monkies are stronger than them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:32:38 same bro im just built too different
