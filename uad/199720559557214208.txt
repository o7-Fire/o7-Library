plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:10:19 those noobs that cant find that door to your plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:10:22 omfg
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:10:29 they stand on the top of it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:10:47 and it makes it hell to take off
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:00 indeed
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:02 but..
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:09 I could see ALOT of people abusing that
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:22 true
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:27 protection mode maybe
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:11:57 true
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:12:09 is there any conclusion on what the new game mode is going to be?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:13:04 I was thinking teams etc
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:13:13 games
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:13:23 nah hes not lazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:13:31 hes just got life to attend to
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:13:35 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:14:17 it could be a game mode that just makes you play tag or hide and seek with no planes or builds <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:14:38 easy one rick
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:15:01 of <:purpTrig:357156668728934431>
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:15:08 ah
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:15:24 I want rick to add more buildings
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:15:36 places too go
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:16:07 I would pin race tracl
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:17:07 add missile targets
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:17:22 noe
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:17:43 rick is still working on some bugs I think
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:17:58 like big build server crashing
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:18:20 a homing missile but you can only put one
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:18:38 and long regeneration time to prevent constant spawn killing
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:19:13 I think pre made bombs would be cool as well as "door blocks"
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:19:20 or invisiblocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:19:30 n o anti radar
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:19:40 theres no point in an anti radar
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:19:54 but there isnt tho
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:20:06 <@!381263178589536257>  absolutly
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:21:07 I also think a sky/clouds would be great but also a minor fall back for toaster users
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:21:50 I think the winch should go faster
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:22:07 and a music box bought with robux would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:22:46 Idk I could just see it getting really abused
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:23:13 <@!587406379451678722>  agreed
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:23:36 the guns are already op as they are
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:23:58 I just think a faster winch would be better
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:24:09 yeeeahhh...
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:24:18 thats quite a few <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:26:19 <@!427466925275217931>  the crazy planes game seems to be having problems with big builds crashing games
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:26:25 <@!381263178589536257>  OH MY GOD YES
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:26:30 PLEASE FIX THE MOTORS
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:26:57 pistons too
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:27:34 idk why
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:27:50 but im telling you pvp is already nerfed as it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:27:59 it makes it fair for everyone
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:28:07 if pvp is nerfed even more
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:28:22 its gonna take a toll on how many people play the game
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:28:38 again if pvp is removed
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:28:53 its going to seriously cut the game down to like 150 people or less
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 14:29:06 im pr ove

creations-chat 2020-03-28 12:25:11 A medium sized VTOL I made for non laggy and quick transport to the lab or other ships etc. VERY comfortable and fun to ride in with smooth controls!In flight mode it does great at high speeds and stopping mid flight, it also features folding landing gear,lights,interior (as always) and seats for all your friends seating up to 7 people with the main pilot seat making it 8.Great for landing on smaller carriers!

plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:48:48 this is pretty raw so far so I still am open to ideas here
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:48:56 ~~might be a thumbnail maybe~~
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:49:15 and im going to need to photoshop and make it look nice
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:49:36 <@!359387481562677249> ye
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:50:02 should I post it in creations?
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:52:43 alright...
creations-chat 2020-03-29 18:54:12 Well this is a creation I was hoping to do a background for my PC and this has taken me a bit and now with the poses/props done I need to render it (hopefully) and I would love some feedback on how to improve it...Once done with the Crazy Planes name and some other lovely things added I hope I can have a nice screen background for my PC! (I got told to post this in here)
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:54:27 <@!409676438682206218>  how so
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:54:47 I can only make it so advanced before it becomes a pain, I have to keep in mind what is seen by the camera
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:09 what could I add
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:16 hmmm...
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:19 is it the posses?
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:22 poses?
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:28 Yeah thats what it is
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:34 thats why I need to render it
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:55:40 and THAT is going to be VERY hard
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:56:14 but if done right it will look beautiful, it might also be the poor image quality since roblox snapshots are horrible for quality
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 18:56:22 ill see
creations-chat 2020-03-29 18:57:04 thanks!

plane-crazy 2020-03-29 23:19:39 Some other guy suggested that I do a mad scientist riding on a rocket. I don’t want to get too advanced because it may kill the vibe. It is also going to take me a very long time if I do add something big,I’ll need his permission before I do that but I will definitely keep that in mind
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 23:19:53 I can’t add a bacon hair doing that because roblox will seriously freak out.

plane-crazy 2020-03-30 01:04:57 <@!409676438682206218>  can you brighten the watermark please 👀
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 01:05:04 its invisible
creations-chat 2020-03-30 01:14:46 SO it has been decided that the basic of the basic shall be used (non rendered sadly) while I am currently working on getting the watermark brightened in the bottom left hand corner. This here is the final product as of now, it has taken of total 5 hours and 26 minutes. (drafting,rough drafts,decisions etc.) and has been finished thanks due to the help of <@!409676438682206218> and you guys!I was hoping to add more but I feel that adding more may make it loose some of its atmosphere and it is open to editing for a thumbnail if it must be. Photoshop the hell out of it and thank you guys for making this possible!

creations-chat 2020-03-30 12:41:33 for all of you curious as too what the man was building in the picture this is the final product of the small but artistic get around VTOL being incredibly nimble and very deadly in battle but yet very stable as well as a great stunt plane.It has a top speed of 315 speed and and take a direct vertical climb at 130 speed.It can stop in 3.5 seconds from 315 speed  and land vertically and horizontally (yes I didn't get that wrong it can land on its nose)

creations-chat 2020-03-30 14:11:34 One of my most prideful VTOLs/creations,The Armageddon flying VTOL fortress is a giant super armored VTOL for fighting those spawn killing noobs and small planes.It is stupid effective for ground support and ship battles but not the best with air to air combat.It is fast for its size and requires more than 20 large rocket engines and 8 super rocket engines to propel it off the ground.Its fully equipped with 5 turrents (including rear turrent) 2 being 6 missile turrents, 1 being close range fireworks, the final one being a hell raining bullet sprayer that just rains bullets and the rear being a 2 missile attack turrent.It has 6, 3 dynamite bombs as well.

The giant craft can handle upwards of 12 missile strikes to every part as long as it has its wings, if 6 of the 20+ engines on one side are destroyed thrusters on the opposing side can help to support it.It can easily stabilize even after being heavily struck and missing massive chunks of the cabin and cargo hold. In the case that one wing is blown off or an engine is destroyed completely then I can blow off both engines to cruise down safely and land. It can hover so well mid flight that the craft can be walked around mid hover for any reason in any condition (as long as the 6 engine rule isn't broken) It can easily go into flight mode and the engines turn forward taking it too a top speed of upwards of 275 speed.Its incredibly thicc and heavy but has only 2067 parts making it better for cheaper computers to handle without causing enormous lag spikes (lag matters in fights) don't let its appearance fool you for its competence,resilience and maneuverability.

Note: This this can take a 90 degree vertical straight up incline without a problem taking it to very high heights

Okay basically if you don't want to read it all its a huge flying armored VTOL fortress.

general 2020-04-08 02:42:09 ^
general 2020-04-08 02:42:21 Yeah chase it into the house
general 2020-04-08 02:42:57 What
general 2020-04-13 13:27:32 picked up a mower yesterday that when I got there found out this 👀
general 2020-04-13 13:27:43 
general 2020-04-13 13:27:52 
general 2020-04-13 13:28:06 he first threw dirt at it to try to put it out
general 2020-04-13 13:28:13 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-04-13 13:28:29 it dumped liquid burning gasoline everywhere
general 2020-04-13 13:28:44 look in the bottom left corner of the first one
general 2020-04-13 13:28:48 youll see some of the dirt
general 2020-04-13 13:29:10 then it only made the fire bigger so he then admitted to THEN spraying it with water
general 2020-04-13 13:29:41 and it carried the fuel down the frame (you san see the burned paint)
general 2020-04-13 13:30:15 so after that he called his neighbor and told her to bring a bucket of soapy water and then they finally put it out according too him
general 2020-04-13 13:30:37 im going by his claims but the engine is fine, the gas tank thankfully did its job and no one was hurt
general 2020-04-13 13:30:56 yup 😉 and also a good idea not to try to jump off the engine from the starter stud
general 2020-04-13 13:31:13 because sparks MIGHT ignite a fuel leak or rubber
general 2020-04-13 13:31:48

general 2020-04-13 13:36:24 I was already told to make a mech but im not that mechanically inclined and I have more importaint things to attend to
general 2020-04-13 13:36:32 this year has been incredibly busy

general 2020-04-13 13:41:00 my uncle In ever got to see because he died from some sort of mental disease or something

general 2020-04-13 13:41:11 he had some wicked ptsd

general 2020-04-13 13:41:20 really fucking bad
general 2020-04-13 13:42:00 when there was a thunder storm outside apparently my dad says he would like take the tv and turn the tv up so loud that you could be inside the neighbors house and hear it loud and clear
general 2020-04-13 13:42:48 and during cops when there was shouting or people yelling he would mute the tv and he would start telling everyone to shush and look around frantically
general 2020-04-13 13:42:58 and he would like freak the fuck out
general 2020-04-13 13:43:56 😦  rest in peace person I never met
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:24:50 anyone remember the BYM days before plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:27:57 <@!682389964541132883> agreed
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:05 Im very close friends with sharky
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:10 hes...
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:16 working on something
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:21 he wont tell anyone what it is
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:58 <#497142796961054721> ill explain a bit more
general 2020-04-15 14:29:40 Basically sharky was left with no choice but to close bym because as we know roblox cares nothing about you or what you like
general 2020-04-15 14:29:47 they dont care about anyone
general 2020-04-15 14:30:41 and after closing experimental mode sharky was left with a broken game but he worked around the clock and spent over a thousand dollars to have the game heavily encrypted
general 2020-04-15 14:30:47 for months
general 2020-04-15 14:30:51 he worked
general 2020-04-15 14:31:23 and coding the game over and over but hackers from vermillion and another sites got very smart
general 2020-04-15 14:31:47 and kept breaking the code before almost tearing the save system apart and destroying the game permenatly
general 2020-04-15 14:32:24 so he had to take it down and he lost everything he spent almost an entire year sacrificing his work and hours of his time to the game
general 2020-04-15 14:32:30 he was broken man
general 2020-04-15 14:32:47 then zen came in and he made the decision to make a new BYM and well
general 2020-04-15 14:33:31 his was much better than sharkys with a better engine and tools, alloowing for more building and with the way he reconstructed it the code was stronger and unbreakable.
general 2020-04-15 14:34:13 Zens game ruled over sharkys and the two used to be friends but when I asked sharky why Zen didnt help code his game..
general 2020-04-15 14:34:22 he got kind of upset and said it was "personal"
general 2020-04-15 14:35:51 sharky lost his most beloved game and thousands of dollars to BYM but yet with the help of me and some other members and hundreds of fans still waiting for the game to return.Shark has told me hes working on something and sent me this picture
general 2020-04-15 14:36:16 
general 2020-04-15 14:36:24 hes coding something..
general 2020-04-15 14:36:35 hes working on code
general 2020-04-15 14:36:53 testing it and reconstructing it...That man is just unstoppable
general 2020-04-15 14:37:16 after an injury on his dirtbike that broke his leg he still kept working on the game
general 2020-04-15 14:37:32 those hackers just kept coming..
general 2020-04-15 14:37:46 fucking roblox
general 2020-04-15 14:38:04 Build your Mech
general 2020-04-15 14:38:25 I was the one with one of the largest interactive ships in the game and the most detailed creations.
general 2020-04-15 14:38:35 I was arranged to be on the thumbnail
general 2020-04-15 14:38:40 yeah
general 2020-04-15 14:39:11 roblox just wants your money they didnt remove expiremental because of the hackers they removed it for money because before the nonfe his security was great
general 2020-04-15 14:39:29 they crammed fe into all the devs mouths
general 2020-04-15 14:39:36 and said live with it
general 2020-04-15 14:40:04 
general 2020-04-15 14:40:16 sharky and I are close friends...I stuck by him in those hard times

general 2020-04-15 14:45:05 and zen and him as close devs as they where are now almost enemies and I think it has something to do with zen stealing the bym idea
general 2020-04-15 14:45:12 and claiming it as his own
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:47:33 I do not approve of code

general 2020-04-15 14:51:34 <@296280922771292170> Sort of Zen kind of stole his community and then ran off to make his own discord server after ditching sharks
general 2020-04-15 14:51:59 I vowed to never play the game again because I was level 3 to 400 or something hell I think I was getting close to a level 1000 hell if I remember you need to check the picture
general 2020-04-15 14:53:58 I had all the most detailed builds you can imagine people had engines with functioning crankshaft pistons connecting rods camshafts. I had giant mining machines with detailed exterior and interior In working drills I had it all. Hours upon hours of work. Some creations like my ship taking upwards of 2 to 4 days to finish. My biggest ship though where’s my pride and joy.I worked for about a month on it. With three deck levels and a five story tower
general 2020-04-15 14:54:18 Detailed cabins control room everything you name it.
general 2020-04-15 14:54:49 Even a working engine inside and then for the fun part the ship even had a sink and parts would blow off and it would start turning very slowly and you had to get the life rafts before it sank or you die
general 2020-04-15 14:57:47 yeah..
general 2020-04-15 14:58:23 sharky is working on something but like I said when I realized what happened I knew I lost months worth of work
general 2020-04-15 14:59:18 if sharky paid 2 grand to have his game recoded by a professional security coder and they broke that your NOT remaking bym

general 2020-07-05 15:26:37 And got it running
general 2020-07-05 15:26:53 At the show in 4 days with crude tools.

general 2020-07-05 15:30:14 Yes.
general 2020-07-05 15:30:31 It was very difficult
general 2020-07-05 15:30:41 Quite a bit
general 2020-07-05 15:31:03 The exhaust valves where locked open as you can see in the picture
general 2020-07-05 15:31:12 From sitting so long
general 2020-07-05 15:31:58 I freed them up and got everything nice and lubricated
general 2020-07-05 15:32:39 Cleaned out the cylinders and had to remove the silt and oil and rust sludge from the cylinders
general 2020-07-05 15:33:37 Had to clean the points and get the mag straightened out
general 2020-07-05 15:33:46 Aka set the timing
general 2020-07-05 15:34:16 It wasn’t the lubricanting that was difficult
general 2020-07-05 15:34:39 It was taking out the valves and cleaning the valve seats
general 2020-07-05 15:35:54 I was super lucky and some one at the show had buckets of Wisconsin v-4 exhaust valves
general 2020-07-05 15:36:14 The valve stems where ceased in the head
general 2020-07-05 15:36:58 I broke one of the valve heads off and had to extract the valve stems
general 2020-07-05 15:37:15 With a small punch
general 2020-07-05 15:38:32 Well no it’s really all cast iron.It weighs 560 pounds
general 2020-07-05 15:38:37 Or more

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:47:24 <:OmegaGasm:585549313422131230>
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:47:53 hell no a game rewrite would result in save wipes
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:48:04 we would all loost everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:48:53 thats basically a game rewrite
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:49:51 hell no if he deletes the original plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:49:53 im out
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:49:55 f that
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:50:17 well I mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:50:45 ^
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:50:48 YES
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:50:59 not a new map but like
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:51:07 caves n shit
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:51:38 first they need to get some of these major bugs out of our hair
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:52:28 Yeah I dont think a rewrite is a good idea right now
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:52:45 it would completely open a whole new world of bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:53:21 gottcha
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:53:29 however they must be careful too
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:53:41 a softcode can make things easier for hackers to breach...
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:54:00 madattak,Rickje, the developers and staff
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:54:17 ...I dont speak about my days of bym'
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:54:57 but it doesn't leave the actual servers save system and other players vulnerable
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:55:09 its not a very easy task too do.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:55:21 thats why no one does it
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:56:00 ye
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:56:24 But seriously a softcode could come with its narrow lines
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:56:35 and loopholes
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:57:23 Im not a scripter myself but I sure as hell would defiantly be careful
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:58:03 one wrong move could kill like half or more of his fanbase if something breaks his save system
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:58:14 cool

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 12:59:57 
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:00:30 Sharky and I are very close friends.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:00:41 he is bringing the game back..Hes been working so freaking hard
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:00:47 the man just wont give up
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:02:13 hes going to be reopening bym soon.Basically Sharky99 made bym and his game was stil in expiremental mode and worked fine then handy dandy roblox came in and ruined his security/anti hack.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:02:34 first think those kids with injectors wanted to do?Screw up the save files
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:04:45 and its what they attempted.Infact a bunch of people on vermillion actually MADE a save corrupter to ruin his game.Zen as we call him made the new build n destroy as a remake of BYM for "temporary" use for players until BYM came back but it turned out Zen had 10 times the experience that shark had with security and with an opportunity to start from fresh Zen used Sharkys idea to his manipulation.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:05:15 Zen copied Sharks game and ditched his friendship...
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:05:40 now wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:05:44 it gets interesting
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:09:33 Sharky however realizing Zen copied his game and now with it far out of his control and Zens game being better in every single aspect from physics to even hitmarkers everything new blocks all that and daily updates Sharky behind our backs to prevent hackers from getting a first tense step into Sharky99s biz has been working indefinitely on BYM.His fans are still cheering him on but Sharky doesn't like talking about the whole Zen thing.Ive been motivating sharky and when I brought up the whole time with corona virus thing.Hes back at it.I talk to him every now and then to check up on him.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:09:58 Hes working very hard, Like I mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:10:09 really REALLY hard on his game.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:10:17 BYM yup
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:04 Sharky has a plan when he reopens BYM so that it will be easier for him to import saves he will be requesting that anyone who wishes for their saves back
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:10 may request
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:17 and he will work on importing them
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:27 to reduce clutter
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:49 yup, hackers are a huge threat too his game
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:11:53 even zens game
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:12:46 but not as much as zens but the reason I talk about this here is because Sharky used to be just like Rickje.He had this giant fanbase like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:12:55 it was huge
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:13:15 and like that thanos snapped
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:13:26 <:Thanos:559116346424557568>

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:30:55 on how you make it and use them
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:40:41 dont worry we aren't missing much of the plane.
bug-reports 2020-07-23 12:23:07 it seems I have this giant armagedon destroyer ship here and its about 2300 parts.Its built for heavy fighting in pvp but upon crashing or explosives going off (like more than 1 or 3 explosives going off I guess blowing up a vanishing part?) the entire roblox client freezes.It forces me to leave and rejoin.
bug-reports 2020-07-23 12:23:13 It can get kind of annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 12:26:53 its all fun and games till the player next to you breaks out the tnt car

general 2020-08-02 02:08:01 Ive been working on a mower that
general 2020-08-02 02:08:08 some one set on fire
general 2020-08-02 02:08:20 would yall
general 2020-08-02 02:08:26 like to see 👀
general 2020-08-02 02:08:56 the mower-
general 2020-08-02 02:11:42 a scots 42" cut, ignited after the ~~idiots~~ individual didn't realize that in order to start any riding mower and pretty much most utility tractors you must mash down the clutch or his battery was flat. Either way he was attempting to jump it off from the starter stud bolt and in the process ignited the fuel line setting the mower ablaze <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2020-08-02 02:12:22 Its another parts mower among my 300 but
general 2020-08-02 02:12:49 I run my own business <@!615876745710534676>
general 2020-08-02 02:12:53 BUT
general 2020-08-02 02:15:40 anyways the briggs and stratton 20hp V-twin of course was still just fine and just the plastic starter gear,plastic blower,wiring harness,engine cooling shroud, left and right side sheet metal coverings,dipstick & dipstick holder where charred,warped,melted or completely destroyed  (carbon burn/black spots) and for some reason it had a lower crank seal leak so I did a lower crank seal so it wouldnt dump oil and cleaned it down.
general 2020-08-02 02:16:23 had a 21.5hp cooling shroud and because all the briggs and stratton v-twins are practically the same things they bolted up like butter and everything completely interchanged

general 2020-08-06 15:33:14 Yall know subaru makes small engines
general 2020-08-06 15:33:22 like lawnmower engines etc.
general 2020-08-06 15:33:38 
general 2020-08-06 15:35:08 
general 2020-08-06 15:35:54 they have made small engines long before they made cars
general 2020-08-06 15:36:13 they found themselves better at cars and making more money in the car industry
general 2020-08-06 15:36:37 but they still build wicked fuel injected small engines and even a few diesel small engines
general 2020-08-06 15:36:46 they are great engines too
general 2020-08-06 15:37:45 saddly almost identical to the predator series stuff though im sure some of yall have heard of the cheap harbor freight predator engines.
general 2020-08-06 15:39:27 okay I eat my words no the predator and subaru v-twin blocks are different 👀
general 2020-08-06 15:40:47 but nonethanless subaru is also known as fuji heavy industries before they became subaru

general 2020-11-11 15:23:18 it could go into sink mode
general 2020-11-11 15:23:31 and you had to escape the ship and the giant cargo boxes falling down
general 2020-11-11 15:23:37 fire and stuff exploding
general 2020-11-11 15:24:00 the drone?
general 2020-11-11 15:24:23 it was Bym
general 2020-11-11 15:24:45 Im still close friends with the owner of BYM sharky.
general 2020-11-11 15:24:52 <@!448505589983739914> its a long story.
general 2020-11-11 15:25:33 The owner of the game was very determined to get his game working but when roblox removed expiremental mode games from being played it ruined BYMs already struggling security
general 2020-11-11 15:26:01 basically but this guy like
general 2020-11-11 15:26:07 sharky was deterimined as FUCK
general 2020-11-11 15:26:10 to get his game
general 2020-11-11 15:26:20 running again like he would literally update the code daily
general 2020-11-11 15:26:42 until the hackers threatened the save system and fucked his security.
general 2020-11-11 15:27:01 they had full control over his game.He spent months fixing what roblox broke
general 2020-11-11 15:27:10 only to be pushed into a pit
general 2020-11-11 15:27:33 and all of it to be bad, yeah fucking crappy children
general 2020-11-11 15:27:55 Im still close friends with Sharky
general 2020-11-11 15:28:11 Roblox dont give a shit
general 2020-11-11 15:28:15 about their users
general 2020-11-11 15:28:25 if they are making money off kids they can smile
general 2020-11-11 15:29:02 legend has it the owners of roblox back ijn 2010 where forced to sell the franchise when they changed their logo
general 2020-11-11 15:29:10 when there was that big update
general 2020-11-11 15:29:27 they sold roblox for what they thought would be a good sum of money
general 2020-11-11 15:29:46 and ultimately turned it into this money milking from your moms creditcard franchise
general 2020-11-11 15:29:54 lmao
general 2020-11-11 15:30:11 I dont know who bought roblox
general 2020-11-11 15:30:13 lmao
general 2020-11-11 15:30:16 it does
general 2020-11-11 15:30:37 theres quite some conspiracies' about roblox
general 2020-11-11 15:30:44 yes some one did
general 2020-11-11 15:30:51 some one bought the name
general 2020-11-11 15:30:59 and turned it into a marketing franchise
general 2020-11-11 15:31:06 no shit
general 2020-11-11 15:31:29 older roblox in 07 and 08 was just like our discord here
general 2020-11-11 15:31:34 it was tiny
general 2020-11-11 15:31:59 and then all the sudden 2010 hit and boom players hundreds of millions
general 2020-11-11 15:32:06 yes
general 2020-11-11 15:32:07 we are

general 2020-11-11 15:34:30 so like legend goes
general 2020-11-11 15:34:43 other legends go that the creators abandoned it or it was stolen

general 2020-11-11 15:45:50 <@!195253906333368320> I assumed he was a developer of the game just like rickje?
general 2020-11-11 15:46:10 oh my
general 2020-11-11 15:46:13 I see..
general 2020-11-11 15:46:51 Rickje took over development of the game because of...His interests in the game or did Madattak just become too busy with life?
general 2020-11-11 15:47:13 I see
general 2020-11-11 15:47:37 so Mad is an alpha developer but as life got busy he had to sacarfice
general 2020-11-11 15:47:43 and move on from the game.
general 2020-11-11 15:47:58 I understand now
general 2020-11-11 15:48:26 thanks obc <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

general 2020-11-11 15:50:45 aight im gonna go feed conduit into my house breaker box with 20,000 watts
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:01:29 I have got a seriously interesting question..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:01:38 maybe im doing something wrong here but..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:01:55 
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:02:00 Im trying to find the weight
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:02:23 equivelancy of a ballast block to one block right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:02:26 yeah yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:02:28 Ive done that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:02:36 but heres what ive found..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:03:15 1 ingame block = 0.166666667 is the weight of one single ingame block.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:03:37 rounded being = 0.17
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:03:41 HOWEVER
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:04:29 I would think okay 0.17 is one block alright so then if I want to make 10 blocks I just do 0.17 x 10 giving you 1.7 right
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:04:45 heres where things get REALLY weird..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:06:01 So i did 10 blocks on the scale (and yes the scale is absolute even with one block between the motors and 2 1x4 blocks on both ends)  on one side and then did the 1.7
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:06:30 on a ballast block painted green as you could see
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:07:37 The ballast block was easily lifted up and the 10 blocks slammed down.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:08:43 I questioned my math and then I thought maybe the blocks on the end where just sticking out creating more leverage and so I made it a flat weight up like a wall and still to no avail the same results.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:11:02 so confused I went ahead and removed a block by block until the weight scale was even and the result has me confused slighty, it turned out that 6 blocks are equal too 1.39
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:11:05 ye
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:11:25 but the 3 blocks to ballast ratio was 0.5
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:11:49 6 blocks to ballast ratio is 1.39
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:03 <:what:653036133105664005>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:10 oHHHH
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:19 oh nono
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:23 not like that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:31 I did 10 regular blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:36 vs 1 ballast
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:12:51 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:13:06 ballast set to 0.5 would even 3 blocks on the scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:13:29 ballast set to 1.39 would balance 6 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:13:39 ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:13:43 Oh thats why
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:13:51 I did the flat one like I said
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:14:01 here
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:14:07 ye try it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:14:10 its weird...
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:14:33 <@!217336009455566848> Sorry for the ping rick but your game has us puzzled
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:14:53 we are very confused here with the weight system or maybe if we are doing something wrong?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:15:56 ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:16:24 what, No its his game, if anyone would know this kind of answ-
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:16:29 wait they added a help channel-
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:16:40 <:dsPTSD:529305285270175760>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:17:26 If anyone would know why the weight system would be so weird it would be the developer rick himself.He designed it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:18:29 but what does this 0.86 variable have to do with the in game weight difference between 3 and 5 blocks. <:FurSayWhatNow:694327153344381071>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:18:44 <@!774377045346091008> whAT
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:18:48 hold on hold on
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:19:09 wait wait..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:19:13 but the ballast
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:19:52 Im doing 8 from the center
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:20:09 both sides
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:21:09 so the ballast is heavier than the 10 blocks with the ballast set to a even 1.7
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:21:30 oop
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:21:50 how could that be..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:27 
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:43 but if each block is 0.7
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:46 in weight
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:49 oop
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:52 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:22:57 .17 in mass
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:23:18 multiply by 10
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:23:23 because of 10 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:23:35 each one being .17 in mass
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:23:43 would give us 1.7
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:27:39 hmm...
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:27:41 I will check
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:27:45 I found that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:28:03 2.45 = 10
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:29:31 I did 0.3 to one block
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:29:48 
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:30:48 WHOA i found out what it was!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:30:55 i used 4 blocks instead of a beam
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:31:06 and it resulted in contamination of the weight
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:31:50 but that would mean that a 1x4 beam is lighter than 4 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:31:58 <:unsettled:661093590818357261>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 17:32:04 Its working now though..
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:13:16 gottcha rick thanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:13:28 Yeah turns out to be 0.3 is = to 1 block
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:14:45 thanks for your dedication to game and we fully understand, But yeah roblox physics is just **motor**

general 2020-12-16 17:49:10 No what I mean is that they would be moderated by roblox for the users that have it but the users that dont have it can see it.
general 2020-12-16 17:49:27 so on their cilent they cant see it
general 2020-12-16 17:49:35 but some one without safe chat

general 2020-12-17 04:52:42 the two cilents can see the serverside differently.
general 2020-12-17 04:53:12 same reason why planes go invisible when you shoot them enough if the game doesnt like to interperit their speed
general 2020-12-17 04:54:04 so it just says "fuck it the planes frozen" when the users cilent sees otherwise.

general 2020-12-24 17:09:00 if your gonna ping rick be respectful and dont waste his time
general 2020-12-24 17:09:22 <@!435946988559925248> hes focused on the rewrite of the game?
general 2020-12-24 17:09:35 So that would explain his absence..
general 2020-12-24 17:10:24 would be a little scary, I mean softcoding the game could result in a chance of exploits.Right?
general 2020-12-24 17:11:14 if they do I have not ever seen them in plane crazy in the exception for a dude using scripts to fly
general 2020-12-24 17:11:30 His game has grown crazy in popularity
general 2020-12-24 17:11:50 if he softcodes it and improves it his could probably hit like
general 2020-12-24 17:11:51 10k
general 2020-12-24 17:11:53 a day
general 2020-12-24 17:12:11 <:dsPTSD:529305285270175760>  that sounds fimilar

general 2020-12-24 17:13:03 Me and shark are close friends.
general 2020-12-24 17:13:40 zen stole his game
general 2020-12-24 17:14:04 its complicated, sharky wanted zens help to fix the game,
general 2020-12-24 17:14:17 zen went on his own accord to try to improve the game
general 2020-12-24 17:14:42 He did but he still left sharky in the dust Sharky for some reason wont tell me what happened between him and zen.
general 2020-12-24 17:15:04 But sharky is the original owner of bym.
general 2020-12-24 17:15:13 I think you need to be patient

general 2020-12-24 17:15:40 theres your answer
general 2020-12-24 17:18:57 the key to finding a good mechanism is staying as simple as possible

general 2020-12-24 17:19:32 as your toy
general 2020-12-24 17:19:55 but it needs to be unique and useful

general 2021-01-10 13:53:29 you see
general 2021-01-10 13:53:55 Rickje genuinely wants to build onto a game because he enjoys it
general 2021-01-10 13:54:04 not because he makes an income from it
general 2021-01-10 13:54:33 and I guess he enjoys seeing people make things
general 2021-01-10 13:54:54 these other devs don't care they just want your robux
general 2021-01-10 13:55:01 or real money.

general 2021-01-18 04:14:07 for god knows rickje is working on something
general 2021-01-18 04:14:25 this game is going to die
general 2021-01-18 04:14:33 if he doesnt do something.
general 2021-01-18 04:14:44 its been months.
general 2021-01-18 04:16:09 many months since anything has been added to the game other than some snow that is part of the winter event
general 2021-01-18 04:16:29 rickje has to completely rewrite the entire game but
general 2021-01-18 04:16:42 thats what he claims hes spent the past many months doing.
general 2021-01-18 04:17:19 Madattak is kind of I guess got a grudge on rick
general 2021-01-18 04:17:29 Im not sure what the beef is on them
general 2021-01-18 04:17:55 but Madattak is not even in the slightest as eased about the game or even empathetic about anything to do with Plane Crazy
general 2021-01-18 04:18:15 neither does he like the fanbase or the players at least the way he acts
general 2021-01-18 04:18:22 kind of shadey
general 2021-01-18 04:18:42 Cant be fixed until he gets the softcode
general 2021-01-18 04:19:21 It will dramatically increase the games popularity.
general 2021-01-18 04:19:35 with the incredibly huge base of players it has
general 2021-01-18 04:19:39 I mean in the millions
general 2021-01-18 04:20:07 Ive been playing plane crazy every single fucking day for the past year and ahalf
