plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:09:00 E so im trying to make the back of a pirate ship but its so hard
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:09:34 I dont really know whats its called
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:09:43 uh I guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:09:44 not really
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:09:55 its like the area with the captains quarters
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:22 the stern just refers to the back of the ship in general
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:28 idek
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:34 its like the square part
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:40 with the wheel
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:56 its so hard to blend it into the ship without looking stupid
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:10:58 ye
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:11:03 but like the entire thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:12:33 oh lol

plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:13:37 Well I was going to put a picture of what I was trying to build but the attach button doesnt wanna work
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:16:41 there should be a thing where you can set a certain object and paint all of them the same color
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:16:51 like lets say your build has a bunch of cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:16:59 and you want them all black
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:17:18 instead of painting them all black individually you can just select all cylinders to be black
general 2020-12-31 23:41:29 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-02-17 00:27:46 <@!343453345542963210> crikey that is one good lookin TIE bomber
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:18:14 is anyone else getting massive lag spikes when anyone else spawns a moderately large creation
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:32:57 is anyone else getting massive lag spikes when someone spawns in a moderately large creation
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:33:20 like 0 fps drops
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:33:23 shame
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:33:39 and for like a solid 15 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:35:16 meh it handles most games fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:35:21 roblox, of course
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:36:03 I manage a solid 60 fps in building mode with 7 graphics bars or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:36:44 I mean its a 2015 imac with integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:37:14 wheeze nothing special
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:38:19 im trying to build a 3060ti + ryzen 5 3600 pc soon
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:38:24 soon™️
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:38:40 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:39:32 basically it would be able to run plane crazy at 200 fps if roblox didnt cap at 60
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:39:38 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:40:56 dope
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:41:07 that and the 3600 are basically identical
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:42:04 I think 3600 just has more threads and a higher octa core clock or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:42:45 specs?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:43:58 bruh no way you're hitting 143 on a lenovo laptop
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:44:10 oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:44:30 crikey
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:45:25 what graphics card does that laptop have
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:45:40 wheeze
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:46:16 oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:46:51 if its a 10400k then thats basically a 5 3600
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:47:27 well the processor doesnt really determine how fast your PC is
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:47:38 the GPU plays that role more or less
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:48:20 Im not sure if intel even has a 10th gen CPU with integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 03:50:16 nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 17:38:54 Same thing has been happening to me
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:18:29 I hit 215k sps in a conveyor engine plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:32:12 ok wtf
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:32:15 this is in non pvp
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:33:17 idek I just spawned in
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:33:21 and it went haywire
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:34:32 which is weird since there isnt any illegal connections or anything
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:34:35 no motor lock either
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:39:03 here is it unfolded
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:39:11 if anyone wants to see
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:39:23 the bow spirit is still being worked on
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:39:41 and its missing the foremast
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:39:44 and its interior
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 01:40:03 its like 50% done tbh
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:13:29 w o a h
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:13:47 your bow is absolutely amazing looking
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:13:59 and your hull lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:14:03 my hull is utter garbage
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:16:57 the thing is I kinda just freestyled mine so I really dont have any actual ship for reference
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:17:21 its a mashup of the black pearl, HMS victory, and HMS royal sovereign
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:19:15 yeah thats probably what I'll remodel next
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:19:57 do you have a good suggestion for the gold color
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:20:02 I couldnt really find a good one
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:21:04 that looks awesome
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:39:11 do-do
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:39:20 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:39:42 yes but it doesnt turn too well
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:39:49 probably cause its 4k blocks and 2 plots long
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:40:39 looks like something from subnautica
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:41:55 just place them in front, middle, and back
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:41:58 easiest way to do it
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:44:59 woah
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:45:01 thats dope
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:45:17 smooth as hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:45:43 wait I was right
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:45:47 it is from subnautica

plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:53:45 you can make it even more compact
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:53:51 using half wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:54:08 if you try hard enough
creations-chat 2021-02-22 05:00:05 <@!511559470376026135> you should modify your AT-TE to be like captain rex's from rebels

creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:34:20 <@!454980072181465088> how did you do those missile pods? did you just use half wedges? thats really impressive.
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:47:07 how come the intakes end before the wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:47:54 the wings still end before the intakes there
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:48:27 also move the wings up and make them thinner
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:17 look how much space the wings take up compared to the body in the reference
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:30 the wings do not need to be bigger at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:55 w-
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:59 why would you move it back
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:50:16 look at the space between the tail and the end of the wings in the reference
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:50:26 now look at it on his
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:51:50 you can make the wings have a more steep curve at the front so you get that intake properly scaled and move the wings up a bit to make it more accurate to the actual length of them comparative to the tail
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:52:13 also, the intakes should come close to the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:52:32 where as yours end long before that
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:53:32 that looks a bit better but you should make the front of the wings a steeper curve
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:54:33 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:55:12 i would still suggest making the slope on the wings steeper
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:58:32 no use 1 block higher than whatever you are using currently
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:58:38 like if you're using 1x2 use 1x3
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:01:12 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:01:16 the delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:02:25 one sec
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:04:54 sorry for my awful drawing skills but
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:05:06 the left is what it currently is
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:05:16 the right is more similar what it needs to be
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:06:34 <@!465121200847192075>
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:07:45 obviously dont take this drawing to the heart but it just gives a rough idea of what it needs to be

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:21:38 No make it straight but use that last thinner delta wing for the entire thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:22:41 Like the drawing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:23:45 No not that lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:23:50 For the entire wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:23:56 The wing is too big
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:24:09 I already did
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:24:18 On the right of that drawing

creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:26:23 use half block triangle wedges for the front glass wedge on the side to round it out 
and fix the paintjob
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:29:26 also the platform standing thingies are supposed to have a slight tilt to them and the front is supposed to have a cannon/light thingy
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 21:52:02 I can confirm dying fish on crack do not in fact fly very well

plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:38:43 never bothered sharing any creations on here
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:38:49 besides like an old ship I built
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:39:20 get jumped by the expert hivemind for not having enough motorlock per cubic centimeter
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:41:21 also when people downvote high quality creations just because they have low block count <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:42:31 three expert arguments are "it doesnt have enough motorlock" "it has exposed motorlock" "low block count"
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:47:13 oh yeah making huge ships move correctly is literally impossible

bug-reports 2022-03-10 00:59:38 there wasnt anything that appeared in the f9 logs when I respawned it
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:02:09 no signs of this on any other builds
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:04:12 rejoined the game. was fixed
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:04:21 still odd though
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:04:32 no lag machines or anything else in the server
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:05:05 it was also saying that I had 0 blocks
bug-reports 2022-03-10 01:05:12 just for the blocks though
contest-chat 2022-06-25 00:44:56 ok what if i build an exact replica of a build ive already built and submitted that
contest-chat 2022-09-16 01:52:59 #contest mfers literally choosing the same basic ass topics every single fucking time
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:37:28 Sci-fi space stations
Land/water assault transports
Fantasy castles
Airborne cities (anything humans can live in)
Sci-fi Capital ships
Land based defense emplacements  (sci fi or realistic) (think of like shore cannons or whatever they are called)
Siege weapons

Etc etc
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:38:14 Getting kind of tired of the generic “xxx aircraft that can be taken any direction” or “word/letter”
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:41:16 Still just a word and everything ended up just being a comical sci fi ray gun
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:42:30 And it doesn’t apply specifically to aircraft per se but any generic “attack” or “assault” vehicle that ends up being  an mbt or something
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:42:54 Perhaps
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:43:12 Land/water transport
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:43:21 Different than just “assault vehicle”
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:43:31 Not really if you think outside the box
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:43:38 It doesn’t even have to be that specific
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:47:04 Wasn’t exactly blaming the contest makers with my original comment I understand that people will vote for shit topics that’s why I said “#contest mfers”
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:47:15 But you asked for suggestions and I gave you them
contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:48:24 Thus my original comment

general 2023-05-14 04:44:38 garbage my brother absolute dog my friend
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:36:03 People here like implying that your build is bad and then not stating why. Anyways your intakes need to be bigger, nose needs to be thinner and a bit longer, and I think the rear might need to be lengthened but it’s hard to tell from that angle. Your wings are also a little wacky
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:36:22 Look at this one for example
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:37:53 Also your intakes should not be flush with your fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:38:08 They should be flat against it
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:50:17 no problem we all start somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:51:19 Just know that a lot of people here have a superiority complex because you don’t have a gazillion bagillion hours and don’t know all the obscure motorlocking designs made by the ancient sorcerers or some shit

creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:50:02 Fleet of retribution giving actual advice (previously thought impossible)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:03:12 “This game with a more simple building system sucks because there are games with more complicated building systems” bruh
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:06:34 If the level of enjoyment you are having is based on how other people think your builds look then you’re missing the point
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:09:39 there’s nothing wrong with trying to squeeze the most out of the system. That’s what the challenge of the game is. No one is holding a gun to plane crazy players heads
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:18:57 You’re the one acting like it’s fuckin life or death lol. If I wanted to do super realistic shit I’d go download blender. I like the building system of plane crazy and I think motorlocking and shit is fun. What’s wrong with that? That it takes longer? I’m not trying to convince you that plane crazy should be the game you enjoy, but it sounds like you’re trying to convince everyone else that they shouldn’t enjoy plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:24:00 Lmao mald
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:26:44 You’re gonna act like a baboon then you get treated like one <:clueless:942802644043464734> no one gives a shit dude go somewhere else
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:30:23 It’s funny because all you have to say is “hey check out this game for those that don’t like plane crazy’s building system and want something new” instead of screaming like a child into a crowd of people who are effectively laughing at you
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:37:07 You can easily convince people who want something new by not being an asshole. My previous point still makes perfect sense. In fact, you are discouraging people who might even want to check out the game that **are** content with plane crazy by basically telling them what they enjoy is actually shit. I’m not even trying to argue with you man this is just advice on how to get people to play

creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:35:45 he won’t warn him because he “hasn’t posted any links” even though he’s stated multiple times he’s advertising
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:37:50 He was doing the same thing for hours earlier and didn’t get warned so <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:40:26 You’re such an idiot it’s almost mind boggling you can keep spewing this nonsense without realizing it. That is literally the definition of what you’ve been doing no where does it say that you have to make money off it
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:45:53 Whatever you want to call it advertising or promoting an idea it’s all the same as far as this server is concerned. I think you just like arguing with people lol because if not you would literally just tell people about your game and leave it at that
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:48:07 What’s the plane
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:50:14 What block are you using inside the wings? If you’re trying to curve them you’d be better of using a motor to rotate them
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:52:18 Ah. Imo it looks a little funky. Also it’s kind of hard to tell from this angle but I would say they should be more swept back
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:57:25 Actually yeah it looks good. I would try to fix the gaps in the wings if those are control surfaces
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:59:41 Hall of fame isn’t great because they stopped taking submissions over a year ago and even then I don’t think they bothered to accept submissions but there are good builds
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:03:18 At the end of the day his logic is “since you cant make ultra-realistic builds given the style of pc the game sucks everyone is crying I am a force of good in the land of the wicked go play my super epic game tailored towards a different style and audience but I am going to insist you guys all are mad because you like plane crazy”
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:06:23 sword the type of guy to say that Indie games suck because they don’t have ray tracing ultra high 8k textures  and photorealistic graphics (it is a 8bit parkour game)
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:08:26 So what you’re saying is that both games have different build styles and challenges and they shouldn’t be directly compared because they aren’t meant to be direct competitors ❓
