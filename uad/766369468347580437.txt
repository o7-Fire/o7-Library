creations-chat 2022-05-02 16:16:32 Bro fr, it looks so bad. Or at least put some ballast to hide those
creations-chat 2022-05-02 16:18:16 If you post creation then don't count on something like "wow nice build". People are honest here so better be good or leave.
If your build is REALLY good then yeah people like your build but shit like that is trash, not good build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 16:21:29 Bro if you have mental problems then go visit specialist, not cry in server where you post builds.
creations-chat 2022-05-02 16:23:48 This is the worst way you can solve problems, you just give up without trying. Get real and seriously visit someone qualified, he will be there to help you only
creations-chat 2022-05-02 16:28:11 Fr, do he thinks that we will pat him over head? We all have problems and your words are true

plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:48:57 damn
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:49:23 i understand making tutorials but copying whole build is the new level of being lazy fatass
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:52:09 you can report it
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:52:13 üëç

plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:17:40 this server is literally to judge builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:18:55 bro if you post build then you want honest opinion not just patting into back
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:20:13 yes and notml told him what to change and sometimes its better to delete build and start over without the mistakes you made before easy as that

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 09:33:07 its like i would take bradley with machine gun, shoot down planes and then classify it as spaa because it can shoot down planes

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:00 bro
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:04 wtf are you talking about
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:15 F-35 have variants
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:49 maybe not? üóø (i know)
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:32:28 wait what?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:32:33 i just read it again
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:32:37 wtf is he talking about
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:32:48 turned upside down and still being able to hover??
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:03 bro wtf
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:59 bro you are stupid
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:34:10 VTOL is vertical takeoff and landing
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:34:16 how tf you want to flip it
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:34:54 it will most likely be going on side
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:36:56 tbh it sounds like heli requirements
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:04 thats what im saying rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:08 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:28 well not rlly
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:40:56 *speed draw*
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:17 thats how vtol works
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:27 if you try to roll it will push you on side
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:37 so its impossible to roll while in vtol
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:40 fr fr
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:15 WOW THATS WHAT WE TRY TO TELL YOU ALL THE TIME
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:43:45 helis can do barrel roll because 
1. they use vtol to go foward
2. they fly high and fast so roll is possible without losing much height
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:43:53 jets cant do because vtol is just for takeoff
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:44:15 easy as that
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:44:21 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:44:57 designer V is nothing special
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:45:08 robotics and vtol V is something to flex about
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:45:15 (for me)
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:46:16 im still wondering how i got so much votes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:46:22 üóø

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:51:30 then give proofs that its not true
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:55:01 should i give more or its enough?

creations-chat 2022-07-29 19:59:24 honestly i would not show this, try to make it smaller and more detailed and maybe try to angle lock the anti heat cage? and dont hide the gun, yes you can make smaller tracks and suspension but will require more work, no its not worth upvotes at all

plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:33:35 it didnt helped
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:33:45 you need to use different combination of colors
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:33:46 idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:40:32 so basically if your build has colored ropes its rare?
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:41:25 my old railgun has colored ropes
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:41:52 idk what else could have
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:41:58 gotta check but most of my builds are
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:42:02 not as old
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:43:34 suspension of my maz has colored too
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:44:03 and those are only builds
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:44:04 lol

plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:52:45 nope
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:52:50 roblox was too lazy to moderate sounds
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:52:58 so they did all for one method
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:53:46 well it was all fine untill magically roblox started to make more useless updates
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:53:52 like removing of old OOF sound

general 2023-06-20 09:05:26 This is called mental disorder
general 2023-06-20 09:05:41 Ped*philia
general 2023-06-20 09:05:52 And its not brave
general 2023-06-20 09:06:32 As i previously said
general 2023-06-20 09:06:36 Mental disorder
general 2023-06-20 09:06:55 Ong
general 2023-06-20 09:06:58 It sucks
general 2023-06-20 09:07:12 Even frog eaters have better
general 2023-06-20 09:07:43 Because this is true tragedy
general 2023-06-20 09:08:04 And no one gave them month
general 2023-06-20 09:08:10 They just took it
general 2023-06-20 13:26:10 so in percentage from 1-100%, how much the game is done
general 2023-06-20 13:27:50 sad
general 2023-06-20 13:27:56 still you gave allot of info
general 2023-06-20 13:28:02 so he didnt abandoned PC2?
general 2023-06-20 14:36:58 
general 2023-06-20 14:37:32 it's nuclear power plant <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-06-20 14:37:46 it wont cause global heating
general 2023-06-20 14:39:28 radiation
general 2023-06-20 14:39:49 also only reactor to explode is RBMK
general 2023-06-20 14:40:22 you can't blow up a reactor
general 2023-06-20 14:40:26 its impossible
general 2023-06-20 14:40:32 only rbmk could do such a thing
general 2023-06-20 14:40:45 meltdown is very likely but not blowout
general 2023-06-20 14:41:00 and usually corium stays inside reactor vessel
general 2023-06-20 14:42:26 you can't do that
general 2023-06-20 14:42:33 it will cause it to shutdown
general 2023-06-20 14:42:40 and pipebomb is too weak to cause such a damage
general 2023-06-20 14:42:51 it's designed to withstand explosions
general 2023-06-20 14:43:23 against 1 meter thicc reinforced concrete wall?
general 2023-06-20 14:43:33 no
general 2023-06-20 14:43:37 its reinforced concrete
general 2023-06-20 14:43:56 ok kiddo you lost opinion privileges
general 2023-06-20 14:44:09 even if
general 2023-06-20 14:44:16 the reactor has allot of layers of protection
general 2023-06-20 14:44:29 you'll need rbmk then
general 2023-06-20 14:44:31 yes
general 2023-06-20 14:44:47 unfortunately the only existing RBMK's are in russia
general 2023-06-20 14:44:54 and they are much safer than before
general 2023-06-20 14:45:09 average furry
general 2023-06-20 14:45:36 dude
general 2023-06-20 14:45:40 you dont get it
general 2023-06-20 14:45:55 yo fat ahh thinks about blowing up stuff without knowing how it works
general 2023-06-20 14:46:07 dude
general 2023-06-20 14:46:26 if the reactor gets damaged it will shut down due to safety measures
general 2023-06-20 14:46:32 its not 1986 where reactors are bad
general 2023-06-20 14:46:55 government will be on yo ass before you'll even try to do that
general 2023-06-20 14:47:06 ironically power plants are one of most secure places
general 2023-06-20 14:47:16 because they are into this
general 2023-06-20 14:47:58 ong

general 2023-06-20 14:48:11 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-06-20 14:48:30 you dont get it that reactor wont explode like bomb
general 2023-06-20 14:48:35 it's like a device
general 2023-06-20 14:48:40 if you destroy a device
general 2023-06-20 14:48:41 it wont work
general 2023-06-20 14:48:53 well uh
general 2023-06-20 14:49:00 this changes the point of view
general 2023-06-20 14:49:29 there already are and the main reason they exist is to stop reactors from existing, not causing economical disaster
general 2023-06-20 14:49:56 ya'll poop nose ong
general 2023-06-20 14:50:14 japanese one had a meltdown and didnt exploded
general 2023-06-20 14:50:22 on the other hard RBMK did explode
general 2023-06-20 14:50:29 however today they are much safer than before
