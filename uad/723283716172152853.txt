bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:12:08 If you have complete symmetrical surface , and launch it with rocket thrusters , (jet too) but place one side with 1x7 and 1x4s , it will register as one being heavier than the other , but is completely symmetrical with no difference , this can be a problem with rocket ships because you need to be balanced to work .
