plane-crazy 2021-07-28 00:45:12 oh so I enable it and it wouldn't explode when it touches my plane?
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 00:45:17 *or other bombs*

plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:20:43 I have like a huge empty space in my battleships hull, what should I do with it
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:21:08 Lazy for that
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:21:15 I want it to be less vulnerable
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:21:28 I get shot down by small ships
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:21:30 so easily
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:21:41 *maybe a railgun?*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:07 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:21 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:22 missle
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:24 probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:30 mouse guided missle
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:39 *wait im a boat idk if it works*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:22:46 F
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:23:01 I'm kinda new to the game
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:23:12 so I'm not good at making missles and torpedoes work
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:28:31 pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:29:45 I have decided
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:30:04 to make a mix of a heli, jet, gunship and ufo
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 01:30:17 I don't like the vulnerability of helis
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:18:06 How do I make something like a ufo that stays in the air, and can move in all 4 directions
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:18:12 like a jet
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:18:30 I wish to make it a gunship
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:18:45 I shall try
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:19:00 ima make a kraken thingy first
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:19:26 should be easier
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:10 <@847591142978748438> Ship? You don't pvp with it.
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:16 You literally get rekt
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:20 no matter what
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:27 unless its small
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:31 like real small
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:41 but folding ships are just target practice
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:23:54 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:24:17 I think I will use motor 2 for my movement with the ufo thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:24:31 *now thinking how to make it able to be like a jet*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:24:47 Alright maybe my demands are a bit too much
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:24:52 ima make a kraken first
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:25:10 I think I will use motor 2 to make he tentacles
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:25:29 That isn't a heli sir
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:25:33 thats a gunship
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:25:40 a weapon of mass destruction
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:26:55 Anyone wanna rate my plan of making a kraken?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:26:58 no one?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:27:01 alright : (
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:30:17 that thing from Tokyo ghoul? zero two?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:31:16 no
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:31:28 n o
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:32:49 I plan to make like a platform thing (filled with cutters and 2 lava spitters) and connect a ton of motor 2 tentacles on it (filled with cutters too) and make it like a sub, I will then like use the tentacles to close onto ships and pull it down and shred it
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:32:59 A demon?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:09 my plans for a kraken
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:16 aka: Underwater shredder
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:27 gl
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:51 ima plan my kraken
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:00 and ufo/Gunship
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:10 I don't like helis
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:17 or mechs
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:22 useless in combat
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:25 and I personally
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:30 don't know how to control those
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:34:44 prefer my gunship thingy
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:43:21 then I prefer a gunship ufo
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:43:28 they are less easy to destory
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:43:34 and even moreee powerful
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:05 I mean I can just use a anchorblock for me to not move
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:25 I'm planning a kraken rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:30 brb
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:42 I wish to devour enemy ships
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:48 its basically a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:44:52 but with tentacles
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:53:31 Hmm do I like use a hover drive (with motor 2 mouse control) for my ufo flight method?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:53:47 and use several super rockets to lift off
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:54:22 ima do that
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:54:35 or do I make a dragon with lava spitters
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:54:51 ima do the kraken first
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:12:13 wait till I make my kraken, I shall drag your creation into the depths of the plane crazy sea *insert evil laugh*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:12:48 or my cutters on the tentacles will destroy the ship before it even descends
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:23:14 darn it a heli
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:23:20 I can't drag that down
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:31:56 My tentacles are full of cutters. No drag=shred the whole thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:32:05 drag down=shred by the platform
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:32:15 and have lava spitters
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 03:32:26 Nooo my fatal weakness!

plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:42:37 ?ban
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:46:21 Do u guys think motor 2 Rocket would work? Like i use motor 2 to control the super rockets / Hover Drive so i dont need wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:46:35 I’m planning to make a decent sized UFO gunship like that
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:47:07 Also, how many ballast tanks should i use for a submarine (that drags other builds down)
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:47:19 Wdym lift *that moment when new player*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:47:39 Im planning to use like the turret style
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:47:54 OHhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:47:56 Well
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:00 So a few wings?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:08 But no control panels
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:10 Would that work
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:28 So ima male it like a ring
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:31 So it looks good
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:34 While working
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:48:46 And have a turret under it
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:49:01 So i can blast the shat out of planes tanks and basically everything i see
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:49:58 Wanna do like a kraken style think, has tons of Motor 1 tentacles (with cutters on it) and pull stuff down. The platform/ Ballast tank area would have cutters too
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:50:12 Cus you know, terrorizing big ships is fun
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:50:21 *as if making a battleship wasn’t bad enough*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:50:27 I made a battleship
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:50:32 Now suffering:(
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:50:58 Anyone help thanks?
general 2021-07-30 07:52:59 <@456226577798135808> You finally got the milk?
general 2021-07-30 07:53:18 Ah ic
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:53:54 <@456226577798135808> Pro, help
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:54:04 I really wish to drag people down to the sea bed
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:54:19 **And have them feel the pain of drowning** *demonic noises*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:55:02 But like when I bump into others they like do bump away
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:55:12 So why cant i use like the tentacles and wrap around them
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:55:14 And pull them down
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:55:32 *i mean crushing them with the cutters on the tentacles is fun too *
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:55:41 But dragging them down would seem eveeeeen cooler
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:03 I qualify for ship maker or smth like that [1]
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:06 But am lazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:11 *i made a battleship*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:14 But am lazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:15 Also
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:56:35 <@456226577798135808> its too big idk how the whole thing looks to give suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:57:03 Sometimes its just original build with no reference
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:57:18 Oh well
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:57:20 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:57:58 So i just cant pull them down in water? Roblox, seriously? Uncool.
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:58:35 I guess ill just use the cutters to make their whole hull go boom
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:59:12 I mean, I’m like a submarine but a platform shaped, i will use like engines and stuff to swim over
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:59:28 I will probably camouflage my self
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:59:31 But maybe not
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:59:40 *its fun you know*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 07:59:45 *seeing them shatter*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:01 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:05 Maybe a bomber works
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:23 *Wha*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:26 But
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:28 I’m talking
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:29 About
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:33 Bombing big ships
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:38 Like those that look good
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:43 But unpractical
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:46 Those are slow
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:00:48 And bulky
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:01:04 Wouldn’t be too hard to sink with a hover drive submarine with tentacles
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:01:30 That moment when they realize they dont have anti submarine cannons
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:01:35 And i would wrap around them
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:01:42 Crush them
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:02:11 Its a literal submarine using Hover Drives
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:02:21 *and propellers to turn*
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:02:32 I think i can kill a big ship
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:02:38 Those rarely can fight well
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:02:49 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:03:01 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:12:54 tonk
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:13:02 cool
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:13:07 but I'm a sci fi preferer
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:13:12 so not too interested
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:22:25 Doom soundtracks I suppose.
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 08:22:45 Violence isn't the answer to our problems. It is a question, and the answer is yes.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:29:30 Totally not like a target for bombers *cough*
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:29:50 *That moment when i realize im only good at naval battles*
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:30:18 Probably, unless that moment when you cant lift off
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:30:43 That works i supose
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:30:47 i had a bomber
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:30:52 and i just idk what i did
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:30:57 but i couldnt make it fly

plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:43:30 629 speed, is that a turtle
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:44:14 Atleast use hoverdrives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:44:16 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:44:19 are primitive
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:45:16 Just use hoverdrives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:45:19 they are fast
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:45:26 and are like almost the same size as rockets
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:45:33 like its just a few blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 11:47:05 why

plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:54:41 I wanna make Monarch mothership in Plane Crazy, but I dont wanna make folds
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:54:48 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:55:05 This is the reference
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:55:24 I want it to look not ugly but eh
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:55:47 Ima do the graph paper concept first
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 06:56:01 *Skillless me ;-;*
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 07:06:52 I plan on adding some trails in the middle, so when I shoot the middle guns, there are circles that make it look cooler
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 07:07:55 Like when I shoot the trails will spin with a motor along with camera
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 07:08:04 So it will make a circle
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 07:09:40 Like this
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 11:00:09 Current design
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:20:33 Ive been trying to replicate smth like these 2 in game, but I cant get the legs or just even tge body shape right, do you guys have any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:24:04 I made it quite big, but the shape turned out ugly ;-;, and I have no idea how to do legs
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:24:39 Im pretty much giving up at this point
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:30:38 Does anyone have any idea how to make a symetrical structure steer and float (on the same height)? I have gravity slider too.
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:31:04 Im trying to recreate the Black Stone Fortress
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:31:10 From WH40k
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:31:30 What should I use to make it rise?
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:31:46 So it doesnt eternally go up and up
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 01:32:12 and, how to do I make it move in different directions that doesnt make it flip?
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:42:28 Uh guys
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:42:44 Why does my flying fortress tilt up
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:42:52 when I activate the rockets
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:43:14 Wdym? I cant read the language ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:46:01 ;/
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:47:13 This is the thing

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:47:54 <@338229121282736129> I use PC to play
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 11:48:02 Was just lazy to boot it up
general 2022-03-30 12:41:14 TEACH ME YOUR WAYS
general 2022-03-30 12:48:05 God
general 2022-03-30 12:48:18 I just saw so many WH40k builds in <#384025409945337856>
general 2022-03-30 12:48:23 Now I want to make one myself
general 2022-03-30 12:48:29 But Im bad at designing it
general 2022-03-30 12:48:33 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:43:58 I have a question
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:44:06 What material is the most tanky
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:44:15 (can take most damage)
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:45:16 Besides that? *I am aware of TNT armor... but it would look terrible on the Blackstone Fortress I am trying to remake*
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:46:22 Thanks. According to the wiki, it says it is tougher idk
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:47:32 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:47:53 *What I am trying to make*
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:48:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:48:17 Indeed
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:48:26 Chaos forces amirite
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:48:57 Standing here, I realise, my prototype is some what incorrect
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:49:00 Frick
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:49:10 Thats gonna be alot of rebuilding
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:50:15 Plus, some types of blocks dont even exist
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:50:21 Which is quite annoying
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:52:05 Im thinking
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:52:12 is there a material bucket?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:53:06 It appears not
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:53:24 time tk manually replace all the materials for a stronker design
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:53:30 as its all plastic
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:53:43 apparently Diamond Plate is better? Thats what the fandom said
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:54:47 frick this game, too annoying
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:54:57 Gonna go back to purging heretics
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 07:55:03 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 08:24:57 Exactly.
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 08:25:08 Plus, too time consuming
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 08:25:49 You my friend, deserve to be purged in holy fire
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 08:26:42 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:58:58 How do you make smaller turnable turrets? *FYI: I want to attempt making an unfolded Imperial ship*
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:59:17 I did a Blackatone Fortress, but I want to be a loyalist now
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:00:21 Played too much Gothic, the influence is getting to me
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:05:38 ima not build until PC2
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:25:16 Hopefully the plot size increases, I really hate folding
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:25:30 Fair
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:26:04 But it would be so much more easy to build anything from WH40k *the scales are so damn different its such a pain*
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:27:15 I wish it would increase by at least double, then at least it would be possible to design a compressed escort ship
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:27:48 True
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:34:25 This is what I wish to try to recreate in Plane Crazy, but as a fold dumbarse, I really dont know
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:35:56 Hmm, will try
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:36:18 Do you guys think the plot will increase in the update?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:36:42 Good point.
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:36:55 Thats what Im talking about
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:37:18 Really hope plot is increased
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:37:37 Make WH40k builds not a pain in the arse
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:38:41 Theres the 4 side batteries each side, 1 turret, 1 lance artillery, 2 side cannons
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:39:17 Im thinking that I will use 2 guns for each side cannon, 6 guns for the lance artillery, 1 rocket for each side battery, 2 rockets for the turret, maybe 2 rockets for front torpedos
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:39:26 Will use gravity slider ofc
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:43:37 Not sure about how to do the cathedral, nose, but the pain is folding
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:52:03 Its from the same series, but that appears to be a battle cruiser, mine is only an escort. the one in the picture would be an Emperor Class, while mine is a Firestorm.

*Not too sure tho.*
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 06:05:33 Do you guys think it is possible to remake this ingame without folding? *I really hope the plot gets enlarged one day*
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 06:06:23 And its only an escort, the smallest ship type besides fighters in 40k
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 08:06:11 You play for satisfaction, I play to prove my faith to the God Emperor, we are not the same.
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 08:11:06 How does it not make sense ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 08:11:26 Anyways, 10h presentation on WH40k lore time
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:32:44 <@262097738169188362> Create this in game to prove your faith to the god emperor
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:33:30 Firestorm, an escort class ship. of the Imperial Navy
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:34:03 Fun fact: Turning on a tank can use the treads only, not damn propellers
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:34:45 Kinda cringe innit? make a based Firestorm Frigate and crush the enemies of the Imperium!
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:35:00 https://tenor.com/view/elmo-exterminatus-explosion-nuke-40k-gif-22693290
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:36:04 Dopeee
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:36:26 Now create it based on an Imperial tank
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:36:35 A leman russ to be exact
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:37:23 40k is futuristic innit?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:39:48 Thats cool, but can you purge heretics while screaming for the Emperor?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:40:22 
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 02:46:31 “Hey you hear any jets bombing our base?”
“nahhhhhhh”
*Huge jet noises*
