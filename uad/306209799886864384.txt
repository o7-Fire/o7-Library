plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:15:38 The Car Carrier isn't finished on the top yet

plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:16:31 and then I have a cruise ship I am making as well, but i still need to add lower deck balconies and finish the back half of the boat
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:16:48 Well on car carriers they usually end up flattening out
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:17:10 like this
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:17:25 and so that was my attempt at doing that
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:17:49 Sorry if that doesnt really answer your question
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:19:24 oh oki, heres a closer view of it lol, it was difficult to really figure out how to make it flatten out without making it look super ugly
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:23:22 And here is my unfinished cruise ship, it will eventually have at least one floor of balconies below the main deck and the top-back will have windows like the top-front, and there will be a door in the side of the hull to board the ship at the docks
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 18:24:00 the car carrier and cruise ship are still under development, i start new ships when others are not exactly done becuase i come up with ideas i dont want to forget ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 21:50:26 what about that game?
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 21:53:18 oh, oki, thanks
