general 2020-09-05 01:25:40 I waltz.. onto a guy building a ship deck gun
general 2020-09-05 01:26:29 Sorry TWO guys building deck guns
general 2020-09-05 01:27:05 One is a full on like 150mm gun and another is a actual deck gun.. ~50mms

general 2020-09-05 01:28:14 It fires and loads
general 2020-09-05 01:28:20 With moving handles and cannon
general 2020-09-05 01:28:30

general 2020-09-05 01:30:27 And his accomplice has a triple barrel deck gun

general 2020-09-05 01:31:34 I couldn't fight against these guys, my level of hydraulics is too low..
general 2020-09-05 01:31:43 It's better than I could ever be!
general 2020-09-05 01:34:07 this mans gun is too damn big it has to fold.. and this oversized one also does the same as the other, but if say that these are garbage I would love to see what you can do.. because I cant do much at all
