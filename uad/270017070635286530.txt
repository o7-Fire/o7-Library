help 2020-12-23 02:55:36 yeah its still not working
help 2020-12-23 02:56:40 
help 2020-12-23 02:56:53 the blocks below it are half
help 2020-12-23 03:00:01 half wedge up, still doesnt work
help 2020-12-23 03:00:22 why does everyone say these are "Easy and simple"
help 2020-12-23 03:01:41 I think I fixed it?
help 2020-12-23 03:01:58 I pressed left control (the conveyor go foward button) and went 300 speed backwards
help 2020-12-23 03:02:45 <@!683847069890510887> idk give me a minute
help 2020-12-23 03:02:59 cuz now my conveyor is falling
help 2020-12-23 03:03:42 yeah so
help 2020-12-23 03:03:43 it works
help 2020-12-23 03:03:44 but
help 2020-12-23 03:03:51 the conveyor is falling out of place
help 2020-12-23 03:11:39 what situation would the Conveyor Engine be useful in?
help 2020-12-23 03:15:51 because I'm starting to think
help 2020-12-23 03:16:08 is it worth it, I'm practically trading in 150 of my regular speed for a 300 burst speed
help 2020-12-23 03:17:14 and it also glitches out my entire plane (as in like, making it turn when Im going straight, losing half its speed randomly, flipping upside down for no reason) when I'm not even using it
help 2020-12-23 03:19:16 idk what would make my plane twitch by just adding in a piston and a conveyor
help 2020-12-23 03:20:02 so I tried zooming in mid flight to see what the conveyor and piston were doing
help 2020-12-23 03:20:26 turns out its the Conveyor thats glitching
help 2020-12-23 03:20:31 its facing upwards and towards the front
help 2020-12-23 03:28:52 well uh
help 2020-12-23 03:28:55 now what should I build
help 2020-12-23 03:32:22 <@!683847069890510887> <@!486276884611465256> any ideas? (something my skill level, not some 8k block ship behemoth)
help 2020-12-23 03:35:36 uhh something thats not a ship
help 2020-12-23 03:39:04 cuz I am really bad with ships
help 2020-12-23 03:42:26 might make a RC-XD
help 2020-12-23 04:09:06 
help 2020-12-23 04:09:11 Why is it not turning?
help 2020-12-23 04:11:38 
help 2020-12-23 04:11:39 It just does this.
help 2020-12-23 04:12:10 Speed is 2, steering is on, collision is on
help 2020-12-23 04:15:45 oh
help 2020-12-23 04:17:35 now its not turning
help 2020-12-23 04:23:37 so uh
help 2020-12-23 04:23:40 what should I make next
help 2020-12-23 04:23:42 (no ships)
help 2020-12-23 04:30:19 why is my plane glitching out
help 2020-12-23 04:30:29 twitch
help 2020-12-23 04:30:29 the conveyor in my conveyor engine is glitching out and causing my plane to like
help 2020-12-23 04:31:54 
help 2020-12-23 04:32:00 thats enough wing panels
help 2020-12-23 04:37:00 nah Idk how to do that
help 2020-12-23 04:37:23 The conveyor is like moving around very slightly
help 2020-12-23 04:37:33 But its impossible to move around
help 2020-12-23 04:37:53 Because its touching like, 5 different surfaces
help 2020-12-23 04:38:38 Ill try to fix that tomorrow then
help 2020-12-23 04:38:49 so, what am I building next

help 2020-12-24 16:02:44 How does one get the GUI that tells you all of your controls?
help 2020-12-24 16:03:15 that sucks.
creations-chat 2020-12-24 16:47:07 nah it works good, 600 speed-ish
creations-chat 2020-12-24 16:49:17 it also has VTOL in it, idk why I put it there but it does.
help 2020-12-24 17:16:32 Uhh, my plane is too heavy, and suggestions on how to make it more agile?
help 2020-12-24 17:20:59 noone?
help 2020-12-24 17:22:29 aight nevermind then
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:28:03 This plane can barely get off the ground or turn, any suggestions on how to make it lighter?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:30:03 it COULD be the entire VTOL system that I added in for fun, I currently am using 87 super engines sooooo...

<@!712670999899799552> already tried that

Bro, where?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:33:29 okay I added more helium blocks and now my plane is lifting up off the ground, maybe its the control of the plane.

any uh...any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:35:39 any suggestions that aren't motor lock

and I have 87 super engines I don't think adding more speed is gonna help

idk how to make custom control surfaces

what are motor rudders

is that for turning or for going up, because I can't do neither
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:37:51 it has enough control surfaces..right?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:40:34 oops I should've read your message first
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:43:00 so I tested it out, still wont turn well. It has the angle and everything but it just continues in a relatively straight path
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:45:57 <@456226577798135808> imagine caring

<@456226577798135808> im workin on the motor 2's right now
