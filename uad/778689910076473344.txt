Please read this carefully: A fair warning, Look out for a Discord user by the name of "ninjachibi" with the tag #1767. He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim as well. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. Discord is currently working on it. SEND THIS TO ALL THE SERVERS YOU ARE IN. This is IMPORTANT: Do not accept a friend request from ninjachibi#1767. He is a hacker. Tell everyone on your friends list because if somebody on your list adds one of them, they'll be on your list too. They will figure out your personal computer's IP and address, so paste this message where ever you can.  He is going around sending friend requests to random discord users, and those who accept his requests will have their accounts  and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. sorry for the ping,
be careful @everyone
Donâ€™t die
just warning ya'll
