general 2021-12-09 18:07:15 in pc2
general 2021-12-09 18:07:34 and just ban anybody that has a motor and cutter

general 2021-12-09 18:10:27 and hopefully
general 2021-12-09 18:10:32 we dont need angle-locking
general 2021-12-09 18:10:34 that much in pc2
general 2021-12-09 18:10:56 then finally big jets would be considered like medium size jets or something
general 2021-12-09 18:11:15 I think that was implemented on purpose

creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:07:44 <@!620688670105534476> F-22 Looks good, The nose ruined it for me.

creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:18:59 Hmmm, nothings showing for me rip
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:27:28 Feedback on this F-22, does it look too shitty? If it does, I'll continue remaking it, if not. Please tell me what could use Improvements.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:30:59 Here is more angles of the jet I need more feedback on what to improve or should I just remake it?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:34:53 cuz jet is big and yes <@!251880826386513924> , more payload xd
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:42:16 Are my wings hella shit too? xd
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:49:19 I guess I can agree with that xd Especially the expose lock. Maybe I'll just remake the whole damn jet xd. <@456226577798135808>  Canopy is fix but who cares? as the whole jet is getting a remake xd (apart from nose)
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:51:49 also uhh expect why this is bad is cuz this was like 4 or 6 months ago
creations-chat 2022-01-11 00:34:45 <@!843374289876680725> that jet looks bad,  I remember you calling my Blackhawk a tutorial and saying " I build better than you" lmao stupid kid
