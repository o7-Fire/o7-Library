help 2022-05-20 22:10:01 anyone who has skills with modeling have any ideas for improvements I could make to the chassis, or how to fill that one gap? I know how to do motor locking so I can layer different parts but I don't know a lot about custom angles. This is the reference with a design I drew over a grid
