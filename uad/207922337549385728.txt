help 2019-02-18 15:25:43 The torque from the rotor blades varies with speed and blade pitch so you can't really calculate a particular value
help 2019-02-19 19:58:06 The tail rotor has to compensate if you spin your blades faster or change pitch so you still need to keep adjusting manually while you fly
help 2019-02-19 20:03:51 And you can't calculate the torque from the main rotor if you don't know the power from the motor
help 2019-02-19 20:06:12 So in short you would have to estimate your tail rotor speed trough trial and error

creations-chat 2020-10-19 07:05:39 > as far away from the body means more leverage but slower and closer to the body means less leverage and more speed <@!447221768520859659>
> aka outer means constant and slow and inner means takes time to accelerate a bit and rolls real fucking fast
<@!484529511468236802> Control surface placement is different from gear ratios. Air drag counters your rotational force at a certain point, which means the rolling can't become any faster past that point. Further away placement means a greater rotational force which means faster rolls. You can easily test this in plane crazy.
