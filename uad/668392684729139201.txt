plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:38:00 Yo
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:38:09 Anybody got a solution for me?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:38:30 I made my own f22 raptor but the back wings that control my pitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:38:33 keep flipping out
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:38:36 and bugging
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:39:56 So it's just a bug?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:40:14 Is there any way to fix it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:40:23 Oh.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:41:27 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:42:53 It's fine.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:42:57 Hopefully they fix it.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:43:01 My f22 is just for looks now.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:43:30 But I'
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:43:40 I'd need control surface delta wing 1x1's.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:44:43 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:54:55 I feel I'm a pretty decent builder but I'm absolutely crap at motor locking.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 10:55:05 I wish I could motor lock well.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 11:10:36 Wow motor 2 glitch ruins my entire f22 build.
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 11:10:40 dang bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 11:10:45 im not bothered to fix it
general 2021-08-13 11:12:27 I built a Sr71 Blackbird yesterday and I'm still proud of the simple motorlocking.
general 2021-08-13 11:12:32 It flies pretty well too.
general 2021-08-13 13:22:03 Finished the f22, a10, and interceptor today.
general 2021-08-13 13:22:08 It was a good day.

plane-crazy 2021-08-13 13:27:07 I finished 3 planes off today.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 07:42:57 What should I make?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 07:43:01 Plane, preferrably
creations-chat 2021-08-14 07:46:01 What plane should I make?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 07:48:03 Fighter if possible, cosmetics mainly but PVP is a possibility. I don't mind if it's new or real.
help 2021-08-14 07:57:16 I'll work on a Su-33
help 2021-08-14 07:59:58 I can add it cosmetically but it won't be functional.
help 2021-08-14 08:00:34 Plus, I have little experience in motorlocking and the only times I've majorly used it is in thrust for my old a10, and in my sr71.
help 2021-08-14 08:00:58 But I'll give it a shot :D
help 2021-08-14 09:16:53 <@!548973346805776396> Are you there?

help 2021-08-14 13:51:53 Why are my spin locks glitching out when I explode the motorlock.
help 2021-08-14 13:51:55 It's so annoying.
help 2021-08-14 13:52:07 I have it in the right place but the spinlocks spazm when I explode the motorlock
help 2021-08-14 13:54:08 My spinlocks aren't working.
help 2021-08-14 13:54:11 This is so dumb.
help 2021-08-14 13:54:47 Waitnvm

creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:01:00 If anybody could give me some feedback on my build in <#384025409945337856> , that would be great :D
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:09:57 Wingspan or the body itself?
help 2021-08-16 11:18:24 So uh
help 2021-08-16 11:18:28 How do I make thin missiles?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:18:59 Heres a screenie, tell me what you think
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:21:31 Yeah, I think I used a lot of space trying to like blend the body into the wings. I can see their point. It's always a bit tricky to make an aircraft that's actually real because it has to be spot on to be good. This is why my unique interceptor is doing alright.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:24:26 Thanks a ton :D, I'll use all this feedback to improve the plane and repost it some other time.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:34:19 Holy crap thats awesome. On a unrelated note, how am I able to make my transition from body to canards smoother?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:37:23 I did what you said, whatcha think :D ?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:46:19 How do I make this transition into the canard smoother?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:49:07 Basically like spin locks? I'd feel comfortable doing them but this is my first motorlocking and it's getting a bit complex.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:51:53 huh, springs, disconnectors? confusion can we talk in <#478584971670454284> ?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:04:53 Ok I'm too noob to use angle locks but this is what it's gonna be for now, lmk what you think
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:09:29 But big engines look cool :( Also, update screenshot after cooldown.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:14:24 Ok so It's smoother now and the engines are smol :(
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:17:20 R.I.P my Su33's upvotes. 5 - 17 ratio.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:23:16 4-18 ratio and a lag machine crashes my server and save data :D
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:25:47 Lag machine crashes my entire server <:trollface:775024642104229898>  I hate some people with a burning passion
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:29:57 Bro I'm about to lose my su33 save data because the server is crashing
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:30:39 If you use lag machines I personally despise you
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:31:24 Some guy in my server is just spamming explosives, thrusters, blocks, guns, rockets, ropes etc and the server is about to crash and I'm gonna lose my su33 save data.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:03:00 Which is better:
A:
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:05:57 B:
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:48:18 ★
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:04:46 I'm not an expert but that's sick!
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:39:42 Better than before or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:42:15 ★ paint this red
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:46:26 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:57:05 Cheers that's really helpful.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:11:35 I upgraded stuff based on your overlay, there are just some things I cannot possibly fix due to my stupidity in angle locking and stuff, but if you could overlay this then it'd be great :D
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:16:05 What colour / colour scheme should I make it?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:18:21 I'll work on it when I get back, thanks a ton!
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:30:41 It's very tricky to paint it correctly cause I have a few too many motorlocked pieces.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:38:04 I'll take a larger dark take on the regular blue camo.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:12:26 nvm doing your idea
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:15:34 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:24:59 What can I improve?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:27:31 Fair enoguh.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:46:56 ★ paint it red
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:55:44 Can't do that, I tried but I can't conceal them when putting them away if they're longer.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:03:12 I have no good colour schemes for the Su33 flanker.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:05:53 I was just working on my Su-33 and I got banned.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:06:22 I was working on my Su-33 until...
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:06:50 Some hovering scorpion tank kept spawnkilling everybody and wouldn't quit it.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:00 I'm fucking pissed.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:10 1 week of no plane crazy Su-33.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:22 Some BS right there.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:41 Why was "gay" taken as an insult, I was clearly stating that the man was happy.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:50 Unless roblox is homophobic?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:56 Roblox is homophobic plot twist.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:09:09 LGBTQ cheezit logo
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:11:41 Maybe I should email Roblox's bot support saying that I meant happy 🤔
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:18:47 Emailed roblox hopefully some indian guy being paid minimum wage in the roblox IT department decides to feel bad for me.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:19:14 Their messages are usually automated.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:19:47 Little did they know my dad actually owns roblox >:D
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:21:32 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:21:41 bruhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:21:45 So gay is now a bad word.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:22:25 "light-hearted and carefree."
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:24:52 Roblox is kinda gay.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:25:26 cries
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:53:19 I was mad at a spawnkilling hovering shredder tank.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 09:54:20 I'm making a eurofighter typhoon but I'm too lazy to motorlock for this build.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 09:59:36 When he realises that there is a gun in pvp blocks that takes up 1 block of space O_O
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:07:55 some quick su57 superiority fighter with lots of weapons.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:14:45 Weepons
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:21:14 haha fixing it up now :D
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:42:10 better?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:50:09 now a working cockpit
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:18:03 Su57, good or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:31:10 how do i improve the nose?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:34:09 Better?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:50:06 Good or nah
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:52:35 Alright, thanks.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:21:40 Better paint?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:24:09 I'm not very good with that :/
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:44:15 Wings are a bit of a pain to fix because the flaps and the limitations of the regular delta wing panels. I could try to use spin locks to angle them but it would leave exposed motors and glitchy effects.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 13:00:52 i getchu, but like, I'll try to have it as close as possible as well as functional
creations-chat 2021-08-21 14:39:36 Better cockpit?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:26:20 Its probably my paintjob its kinda trash And I'm gonna neaten it up
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:29:08 Looks epic but I'm not a very good builder :/
creations-chat 2021-08-21 23:55:55 Why is it not good? What can I fix?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:12:10 <@456226577798135808> isn't that van from a tutorial?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:33:46 Better than my last posts or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:42:28 How so?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:44:32 I see, it's just that I'm not able to make it slope down for that long so I made it flat in some spots to try to get it longer sloped/
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:48:20 It might be the camera angle, I think they're decent size.
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:54:34 I would be able to fix the slope from the nose if I had resize tool :(
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:03:56 idk if this is an upgrade?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:16:23 I'm trying to angle the cockpit but it's insanely difficult, there is this part that goes up on the sides but it's hard to recreate without making it a bit bulky.
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:37:43 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 13:05:23 found this slick new design
creations-chat 2021-08-22 13:08:46 
creations-chat 2021-08-23 08:50:41 Does this look alright for a su 57? 2 mins there is a glitch making my window look crap
creations-chat 2021-08-23 08:53:25 I know it's a bloody pain to get it right.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:06:26 Better?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:36:01 huh
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:52:45 You think my Su57 will get upvotes or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:57:15 <@!345527706340818944>I wanna try to make the paint look smoother idk how tho
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:01:34 shittttt, how do I make the wings more angled?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:18:25 it's so difficult I'm gonna explode
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:22:04 Does anybody know how to angle the wings to resemble the actual su 57?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:24:20 How do I angle the wings to make it steeper?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:25:41 I mean how do I make wings sharper you know
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:26:04 but how? every time I try it it either won't fit or bugs out
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:05 Like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:06 
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:13 how do I make my wings match
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:19 it's tricky
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:42 it keeps glitching out
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:27:54 I did.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:28:23 It messes up my main motor lock tower and I'm like 90% sure it's not connected to a lower level.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:28:34 My motorlocking is cluttered and already capped off.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:28:41 I have very little room to work with.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:30:35 Wait I think we're misunderstanding I probably worded something wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:30:44 Not sharp as in pointy at the end.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:31:00 I want my wings to be going downwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:31:29 Normal 1x1 deltas don't allow me to slope it down that much.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:31:50 You see how my wings don't slope down enough?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:31:59 When compared to the image.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:32:30 I got like no space tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:35:01 Sorry, it takes me a bit to understand things.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:35:25 Angle locks but I have no space
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:36:35 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:36:41 sorry I don't really understand
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:45:43 Any better?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:47:13 Alright bro.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:51:21 Still not working
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:51:42 Looks goofy asf
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:52:10 I think I gotta angle lock it :(
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:52:15 I'm so trash at it.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:53:01 A lot of things.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:53:05 I tried to make it look better.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:53:12 But it looks disabled.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:53:57 Time to cry myself to sleep.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:54:02 And try to angle lock tomorrow.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 12:54:06 :( so sad

help 2021-08-24 09:23:26 But don't I need to angle lock stuff to make it look smooth?

help 2021-08-24 09:37:07 <@!714878625484243101> Do I need to motorlock more delta wings so that it looks smooth?
help 2021-08-24 09:40:20 Ok I tried to do it, and they were all in the right place, but they like flash in each other
help 2021-08-24 09:40:29 And it's glitchy.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:01 Wait I just did something epic.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:15 I fit 2 1x1 delta wings in the same block space with motorlock and it's not glitchy
help 2021-08-24 09:43:38 Ohhhh.

help 2021-08-24 09:43:44 Thanks.

help 2021-08-24 09:44:02 I'll post a nother image later.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:00 but, some of the delta wings aren't holding on, and there is no way to hold them together.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:48 Wait I got a good idea.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:54 Holy crap I'm so epic and cool.

help 2021-08-24 10:13:32 How do I have a ring going in the glass?
help 2021-08-24 10:14:44 So yeah, it's a big tricky imo.
help 2021-08-24 10:19:17 I added my own personal twist to the paint.

creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:32:50 Yeah somebody told me they were too small
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:35:01 The 3 triangular sections at the back of the wings need to be deeper. The intakes and cockpit/body need to be wider
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:51:47 Feel it get stiff? uhhhhhh

creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:37:51 It seems that maybe my Su-57 is kinda bad.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:41:37 Maybe it's the first image that's bad? I'm anxiously looking at the voting.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:24:51 put an f14 inspired painjob on a su35 lol?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:28:38 Okay I don't have enough space to put fancy text and symbols on the su 35 :(
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:31:00 I think it looks awesome
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:43:14 What other features should I put on my su 57? Not thrust vector because my motorlocking completely prevents it.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:45:55 Apparently it doesn't. What else could I add? I could try the opening cockpit like you suggested <@!751424469657976843> , but I could run into issues as my canopy is majorly motorlocked. I'll try to find a way around it.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:49:40 I'll try the fancy landing gears, I'm pretty bad at it so if it's too obnoxious when retracted, I won't do them, as I'd rather have a streamline flying experience.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:03:08 okay landing gear is a big nono, looks extremely bad on my plane, and I have no space to make good looking gears wanna see the jet tho?

creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:40:37 can you link me their su 57?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:42:41 I wanna make the souless one bcuz general grievous is cool
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:57:31 we don't really look anything alike?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:00:06 I guess so, it's just common to use triangle wedges because that's the only somewhat accurate design. I also don't want to be rude, but I don't understand how it got so many upvotes?
help 2021-08-27 13:09:58 what are those thin things at the front of the tank in <#384025409945337856> , they look like little cylinders, what are they?

creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:36:51 thank you man, I'm sure the f22 is gonna turn out amazing, excited to see a cool f22.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:40:10 if you have the space, go for it, if you don't just try to focus on appearance.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:44:04 Try to make the engines look better like russian said, I'd recommend wedge 1x4 and triangular wedge 1x4 engines. + motorlock does help make stuff look good
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:47:23 <@!389756407483990028> The colour needs to be less "eye-popping" and the vertical stabilisers are a bit too curved in my opinion.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:49:25 Yeah I like those engines you can incorporate cylinder 2 2x2s to make them longer if you want.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:51:30 That's starting to look real nice. I personally think a Su27 or 33 back design would look nice, in that joining part there is a bit of a curved beam that comes out a bit, but that's up to you.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:54:25 Looking good, try to make the front part of it less curved, but even with curves it's alright.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 14:11:55 Lava spitter afterburner?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 14:19:49 that looks pretty good

creations-chat 2021-08-28 01:53:58 I just realised if you attach something to a camera, you can rotate the camera and therefore rotate the entire thing to your exact need.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 01:56:50 Intakes, slurp
creations-chat 2021-08-28 02:36:19 You can have delta or normal winged fighter jets, you need more angle either way <@!814652641207386123>
Fix the cockpit and the nose, especially the random blocks that make it uneven.

creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:03:48 canopy update?
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:22:41 Radar station, also, it doesn't seem too tall to me?
help 2021-08-28 03:30:08 Yp need to have more control by adding flaps or more control surfaces
help 2021-08-28 03:30:26 currently it is too heavy, and doesn't have enough upwards lift due to not enough control surfaces
help 2021-08-28 03:30:49 wings will help it glide and fly, but control surfaces and flaps will let you pull up down and roll.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:35:59 I think it's alright, but it's just not interesting enough for an upvote. It's just a red car. I'd recommend adding a 155m Howitzer onto the back. Right now it just looks, meh.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:43:40 Only reason you have the designer role is for making a cringe pixel art that probably took 5 minutes. Not a valid argument.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:45:56 Telling me that this took longer than 5 minutes? That's disappointing.

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:26:17 Su 33 is difficult if you want a drooped nose.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:26:34 I did the drooped nose and it's kinda a meh build.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:27:14 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:27:55 I basically just stuffed a lot of angled pieces together.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:29:03 My engine "bump" things are all custom angled, because it was on the level where I couldn't fit much stuff, plus I screwed myself over with a tiny motorlock tower.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:29:45 Too lazy to do too much angle locking, as I just worked my ass off on the rest of the plane.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:29:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:29:54 The nose looks meh from the front.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:30:15 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:31:28 Keep practising, you'll get better over time.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:31:38 I used to build trash builds that didn't work whatsoever.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:31:46 I kept learning and over time I can kinda build.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:31:50 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:31:54 Also, here are the angles.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:39:50 Yours is probably better.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:39:54 I'm gonna assume.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:40:30 Still looks good.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:40:48 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:41:35 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:42:24 That might actually be a good idea.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:42:28 An internal weapons bay.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:42:36 I'll create a model without external weapons.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:45:08 <@!722743711628394517> I used 2 Half Wedge Downs on each side.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:45:10 To make it angled.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:45:13 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:45:21 And motor locked in the rest of the parts.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:45:26 So they would fit under my wings.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:46:55 Without weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:02:08 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:02:27 Wait was that for the comment about what the engines make me do?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:02:50 Oh alright, sorry bout that.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:03:06 I had to use control surfaces so that they don't stick.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:03:09 And they can freely move.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:06:08 The flaps got adjusted.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:06:47 Because I'm too lazy to fix it.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 14:12:39 It was the body piece connecting to the engines. It's the curved piece or the "bump" look at the centre of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:19:03 I could make working alerions but nah.
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 14:19:12 Ailerons*

creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:10:02 Yeah, I said "this gay dude". Also, engine redesgin.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:22:29 Use cameras if you want the text to be completely invisible, or just put a full stop in all of the text to make the text smaller.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:46:01 Is the shortened nose better?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:51:41 So longer is better?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:56:21 How do I turn off engine fire?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:01:11 Anybody wanna compare Su 57's for accuracy? I need to know if my wing size is right?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:07:20 The real su 57 wingspan to length ratio is 11:6, mine is 11:7, good enough I guess.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:09:24 The real wingspan is 63% the length of the body. Mine is 56% of the body length.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:19:43 Okay this might be my final design, worth posting?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:23:47 My next project might be an AC130 Gunship Inspired from Modern Warfare 2.

creations-chat 2021-09-02 08:02:13 I did the intakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:33:13 I think I'll stop working on my Su-57, it's clearly not very good. Time to make a custom plane.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:43:39 Plane. <@!467459282250629120> There is not much I can do to improve it, since the fuselage and engine pieces were made on the wrong half block level, and I do not have enough space or effort to redo them and motorlock them a half block down.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:09:09 Your su 57 looks awesome, I saw it a bit ago in creations and I’m blown away by how good it looks.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:16:48 Would be cool

Surprised on how far I've come, while considering the amount of times I just wanted to give up and quit. I'll still be working on improvements and stuff, so let me know what I should do! 🔧
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:45:13 <@!345527706340818944>
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:48:13 Cries in no thrust vectoring.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:51:50 I had the option of thrust vectoring, or keeping my afterburners and I'm too lazy to change them out. Afterburners and cool effects = votes. Do you want to compare in game?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:56:06 It might be able to work, but I think the cameras will glitch it out. Can I see your plane in game?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:58:20 This top section also pokes into my engines. They make the entire fuselage silky smooth and I'd rather keep them.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 12:14:12 all good bro, im heading off too, have a good rest of your day
creations-chat 2021-09-08 11:37:15 What colour scheme should I make my Su 57?
creations-chat 2021-09-08 11:40:23 ace combat lol?
creations-chat 2021-09-08 12:29:53 Good or nah? What do you mean by that Atomic?
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 05:43:57 my internet is so fucking slow today it's so painful.
creations-chat 2021-09-09 07:23:57 Incredible, the size makes it viable for carrier landings in most planes.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 03:12:09 Starting to become too laggy to fly (1300 blocks)
creations-chat 2021-09-11 03:44:42 That's my only turning tho :(
creations-chat 2021-09-11 03:50:01 Wait does that actually work?
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:22:44 Excessive use of cameras and angle locks as well as random little pieces here and there.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:44:42 my bad bro, I'll fix it up
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:48:58 Update, removed the exposed motor lock
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:54:58 Ignore the exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:06:27 Very nice
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:08:30 looks nice, the vertical elevator seems a bit too steep
creations-chat 2021-09-11 08:45:06 Add external weapons to my su 57, removing the stealth? <:Upvote:490311647492309004>  or <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:02:01 maybe bigger elevators?
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:36:11 Trying to make sure all edges are flush.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:39:07 I hate this fuselage part and there is nothing I can do to fix it.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:41:36 Pretty much
creations-chat 2021-09-12 03:32:46 Last time I gave you feedback you started an argument <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-09-12 08:09:21 Exposed motor lock is pain but other than that it looks awesome
creations-chat 2021-09-12 08:17:05 Blockate kinda inactive today
creations-chat 2021-09-12 08:45:14 Last time I said something truthful to him he got mad, that's quite ironic.
creations-chat 2021-09-12 09:02:06 That didn't age well, he's in my dms

creations-chat 2021-09-12 09:19:08 🤓 mans really opened the blocked message to say that
creations-chat 2021-09-12 09:32:42 That was my early model su 57, looks alright I guess
creations-chat 2021-09-12 09:38:37 Yeah, I’ve been working on it lots.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 07:16:07 lock the seat down?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:24:58 Fuselage good lol?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:27:10 Not enough room for custom angle :(
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:29:19 Not sure what to fix or improve now :|
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:47:38 Just had an idea, should I fit a bunch of smoke pipes in my jet to recreate a "sonic boom" effect?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:55:09 I'm not sure. Also, I can try to work on the nose but i have very little space to hide my motors
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:26:52 Yeah but it's difficult to get a continuous angle at that position.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:29:40 Basically my motor lock tower kinda  stops it from angling that much but I'm trying really hard to get alternatives and stuff. before this I'm gonna try to make the airbrakes. Another idea I have is to have the engines just curve down into the fuselage instead of connecting to create a Y
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:37:04 Left or right?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:41:46 Better?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:53:02 This is just the most I can get from angle locking.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:59:45 - Makes Plane
- Receives criticism for attempting to make the plane because it has been made before.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:05:15 However you said Su-57 and right after I posted an image of my Su-57, questionable.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:08:04 Better?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:10:27 Experimental Airbrakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:16:25 Better nose. P.S should I have airbrakes or a simulated horizontal thrust vectoring system with the Vertical Stabilisers?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:20:28 Wait I can actually do that hold up. Haha it would work flawlessly if my build didn't put me at 10fps and 1000 ping.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:24:35 poo
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:27:40 My earliest Su 57, It's now some sort of custom ground attack jet.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:29:52 Exactly my point.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:32:11 Without the exposed motors that would be perfect, still a good build though. Also <@!671639907281666069> wdym?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:35:53 And how does that apply to me?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:40:04 <@456226577798135808> Just an idea but if you have space you can motorlock a 1x4 wedge and 2 1x4 triangle wedges down half a block to create the back of the cockpit, just a random idea, completely up to you.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:44:35 Is this nose alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:59:11 New fuselage desgin, good or nah?
Also the sharp edge behind canopy is an angling mistake I was just rushing my angling.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:03:03 Can you help me make it better? What is wrong with it?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:05:58 Alright, will do.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:08:37 Spazzing out, the motor 2's keep glitching.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:14:36 Maybe I should try regular motors?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:20:44 I have like 8 motor 2's and they make it look ugly. 
2 of them on each side are for the vertical stabilisers and airbrakes as well as yaw.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:23:11 Yeah but if I try to cover them or something they'll start spazzing.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:25:42 Also the nose doesn't seem too long to me. Also the motor 2's will be worked upon in a sec. But I don't really want to change the motor 2's because it risks the functionality and it's not all too bad.
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:27:57 Decent nose to body proportions?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:35:24 Very good idea, however I'm tight on motorlock tower space once again and I'm not making more towers or continuing my tower.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:37:43 I would make the rear of the wings either completely straight or have the slightest increase when going into the body so the wing looks like |_/ or \_/. Oh wait that's just a shadow nevermind. Very very good build but try to lock some normal wing panels to stop the cheese grater.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:50:23 Ah, all good.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:53:31 Air Brakes lol
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:56:42 That's why I have so many motors, the stabilisers are able to rotate for the yaw and brakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:58:51 Haha, but, it works.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 11:01:42 Another issue, my hand keeps resting on the motor lock keys.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 11:14:11 yees
creations-chat 2021-09-16 07:51:34 Fuselage could be a lot better, make the nose longer as well. Try to smooth the entire thing out as best you can.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:46:00 Fix the blocks and smooth it out
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:48:43 Not just the paint, the paint is alright. Fix the poking out bits
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:00:19 True that
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:02:24 Very good build, would recommend making the stabaliser further out and not on the engines, but thats up to you.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:18:49 If its difficult it's not a biggie, still a good looking build.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:23:45 Hot take but:
Putting texts to decorate your decent builds = upvotes
creations-chat 2021-09-17 08:32:46 Honest Feedback:

It's still very choppy, and the rear elevators seem to be misshapen.  It looks very duck-like, exposed motorlocks also lessen how good it is. Cockpit is alright as it is Vulpens design but it can be improved slightly with angle locks. There are also some gaps near the cockpit.

What's good:
The angle locking on the fuselage is correctly angled, and the paint scheme seems to be very smooth. The cockpit is pretty good, the landing gears are functional, there are small details such as russian flags and radar. From what I've seen the intakes seem pretty good.

Take this how you want, sorry if I came off as rude, I still think it's an awesome build.
creations-chat 2021-09-17 08:49:37 Which side of the fuselage is better?
creations-chat 2021-09-19 11:58:40 Added 8 locked motors  to redo my fuselage, with painstaking effort into hiding everything somewhat flawlessly. It might not look good, but I think it looks better.
creations-chat 2021-09-20 05:40:20 Does this nose look alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 08:53:23 Sound I try to angle lock the nose?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:10:24 Personally I think that this nose looks the best out of what I've tried. <@!739369649971527720>  yeah that's the problem
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:12:52 I've got no other options to be completely honest. There is very very little space to hide motors, furthermore there is not much space on the motorlock tower itself.
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:44:57 The product of motorlocc
creations-chat 2021-09-21 05:35:34 Because it looks bad
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:51:28 Probably the best i've gotten from locking the nose

creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:30:27 I think the current ones are the best it's going to get.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:32:39 Oh, I thought they were a lot too thin. I'll try that design again.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:39:41 This seems fine to me.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:45:15 Bruh you do realise this channel is called "creations feedback", I'm just trying to make a good plane that is well received in a reasonable time.
Am I supposed to wait for your approval to post a screenshot and talk to somebody?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:51:53 And you might need to take some advice on "trying" to improve your plane

creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:06:01 You complained about me posting screenshots and conversing. When I talk to somebody, I really do not need your approval when you do not have to care.

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:09:42 So tell me this, why do I need your approval to talk and receive feedback? <@!447139512707973120>
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:10:54 Caveman? You're the one so heated because you observed somebody else do something completely normal?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:11:25 So that means you simply accept the fact that you're an idiot?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:11:42 How so?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:11:58 Then why are you mad?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:12:04 You're mad that I posted screenshots?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:12:16 "fuck your f-15 man"
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:12:20 Let me quote it.

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:12:47 I'm curious to why you are mad?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:12:55 There is literally 0 reason for you to have a problem.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:13:08 You're clearly stating that you do not like me posting screenshots?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:13:16 It somehow makes you mad that I posted messages?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:13:39 Bruh you started this shit stfu

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:14:12 A retelling of what happened.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:14:15 I had a conversation.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:14:44 You complained about me talking to somebody for the reason that you don't like seeing my messages?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:15:08 You know you can block people.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:15:19 There is 0 need for you to complain about me talking to somebody else.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:15:27 Never did I ever mention you.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:15:33 But you still had a problem with me talking.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:15:51 Pretty narcissistic.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:16:25 I ended it a while ago and he continued being a prick.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:18:06 Stfu
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:18:59 You criticize and instigate just because of your narcissism. Don't act like you're calm and you don't care just because you've lost an argument.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:19:10 You can see again you're just trying to start stuff because you are a prick.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:19:26 The whole reason this started was because you got mad that I talked to somebody else.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:19:30 You're pathetic.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 10:19:47 No problem.

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:14:50 and get 150 downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:20 you know
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:21 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:39 
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:40 This one
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:52 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:53 
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:15:54 This one
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:16:13 an anthropomorphic mess
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:16:44 *thats what the point of the mask isss!*
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:17:10 yes I'll make a david dobrik apology video
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:17:24 i swear david dobrik makes an apology video every 2nd day
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:17:30 might go binge watch them
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:18:07 honey I know I cheated on you with another man, but, I didn't know I was cheating!
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:18:40 What's another thing I could make <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:19:44 I could make this into a functional bomber
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:20:14 Ben ten but he took lsd for 2 years
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:22:26 Or I might make a passenger plane.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:22:29 Who knows
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:23:17 You see there is a certain amount of plot space
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:23:28 an idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:24:40 You'd need a pretty large SSD to hold that much data.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:35:24 I got a downvote on my su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:35:34 it was from the dude I argued with earlier
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:35:37 hahah
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:35:39 that's funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:35:51 bro that looks like a-
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:38:33 BRO
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:38:37 this is my time to shine
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:38:54 i made one literally 2 days ago for no reason whatsoever
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:39:10 magik
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:39:29 lemme show you
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:47:53 
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:47:57 this is the multivehicle
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:48:00 it doesn't look good
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:48:01 but
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:48:02 it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:50:32 There is a vtol system
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:50:39 it's not too well working
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:51:01 it climbs 90 degree surfaces very well
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:02 That's painful
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:08 It has a similar nose design\
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:10 to the su 57
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:15 and it's really hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:17 to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:28 but nice job so far
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:54:31 it looks good
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:55:20 thanks man
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:12:36 Yeah understandable
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:12:47 You know I might make some more improvements in the future
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:12:54 Maybe
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:12:57 Just maybe
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:13:02 Or I’ll redo it
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:13:23 Yeah tried to do a sort of point without it looking too duck
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:13:57 I didn’t have too much space
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:14:14 If you look inside the cockpit its packed with locked motors.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:15:07 Dang looks really nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:15:46 I’ll practice motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:17:22 I think another problem was that I started the plane poorly, and from there I just kept improving, but the original base of it proved problems and created limitations.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:17:41 Might be helpful to create a planned beginning for the plane.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:20:08 What modern fighter jet should I make next? Looking for something interesting and easy, but not too easy.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:31:38 I think I will work on my f15
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:34:42 but the fact is
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 13:34:54 i need help im failing all my classes 😩
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:52:55 What do you think so far?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 14:00:50 glider looks cool, i think there will be a lot more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-09-27 14:05:00 Weaponry, whatchu think?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:05:58 Anything look wrong with this to you?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:08:03 Yeah I fixed them up.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:08:27 You just gotta practice
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:13:40 Okay so I added rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:13:44 But there is still 1 problem.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:13:50 It can't fly.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:13:53 :(
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:14:13 to make it hover?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:14:48 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:14:50 I'm using them.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:14:54 It gets to a flying speed.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:15:05 I just don't have any way of controlling my flight.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:15:32 Nah, they get welded when my motors lock.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:15:37 They didn't work last time
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:15:49 I tried them and they didn't change anything.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:15:55 My plane is pretty heavy too.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:16:08 I'll try that again ^
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:30:50 yep the whole elevator idea didn't work
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:30:59 so many motorlocking pieces just clog it up
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:31:01 can't fix it
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:39:34 ok im heading off cause my f15 can't and won't fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:39:56 you would like to see?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:40:07 the whole wing is control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:40:13 and it doesn't even lift up
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:40:22 maybe it's weight
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:40:26 but i'm not bothered
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:40:34 here
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:41:08 
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:44:06 the prop part works
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:45:39 at last
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:45:40 however
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:45:45 i might use jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:45:53 for more power, and for more concealment
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:47:32 but she does fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:50:27 <@!601088113959370752> Ayo thanks bro, really helped me out when I thought I was done for, really thankful for that.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:51:29 Quite a bit for the intakes.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:51:44 intakes are just wing panels locked in half a block.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:51:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:52:06 and the weapons need to be locked in to keep it smooth.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:53:36 mkay I might go to sleep now, hoping the best for my build in terms of upvotes and stuff, who knows
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 14:53:44 gdnight yall

creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:10:55 My first plane to have functional landing gear :) ||Yeah it's stock lol I'm too lazy 😩 ||
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:35:07 Overdetailed?I just added a bunch of signs not sure if it makes it look ugly
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:37:08 What should I add?

general 2021-09-28 05:27:47 What
general 2021-09-28 05:28:11 Wait what's wrong with it?
general 2021-09-28 05:28:53 What's wrong with it?
general 2021-09-28 05:30:11 Ok lemme boot up my pc then
general 2021-09-28 05:31:45 I getchu but you could have worded your opinion better
general 2021-09-28 05:32:50 Im looking around
general 2021-09-28 05:34:57 This is with the wedge down <@!690233229642563725>
general 2021-09-28 05:36:08 Also what's wrong with the intakes?
general 2021-09-28 05:36:13 
general 2021-09-28 05:36:32 Isn't that accurate?
general 2021-09-28 05:37:34 
general 2021-09-28 05:37:37 Ignore my characters arms.
general 2021-09-28 05:37:42 I can't help it.
general 2021-09-28 05:37:53 😭
general 2021-09-28 05:37:59 smol build
general 2021-09-28 05:38:18 am white name
general 2021-09-28 05:38:19 cri
general 2021-09-28 05:38:29 I tried to make a 1 block wide build
general 2021-09-28 05:38:39 
general 2021-09-28 05:38:43 Nice.
general 2021-09-28 05:38:48 Looks very smooth.
general 2021-09-28 05:39:23 
general 2021-09-28 05:39:26 A lot of cameras.
general 2021-09-28 05:39:35 Actually.
general 2021-09-28 05:39:39 I only have like 90 cameras.
general 2021-09-28 05:39:49 So my build would be around 500 blocks.
general 2021-09-28 05:40:12 Let me tell you a little secret
general 2021-09-28 05:40:19 ok sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:40:21 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:40:23 new chat
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:40:58 Yeah so my plane is unable to provide enough pitch with control surfaces, and I'm unable to add functional elevators
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:41:37 So the pitch is made using other forms because it really wasn't working.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:42:01 Flaps were another no go because the motors had to stick out and it only provided roll.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:42:08 so I just used other methods
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:42:39 Yes.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:42:43 That's my pitch control.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:42:58 I used jet engines because my build was too heavy to actually pitch with flaps, if I could add them anyways.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:43:14 The elevators can't move.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:43:48 Stuff motorlocked inside of them glitches them out.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:43:58 And I didn't want to remove the entire back portion of my motor lock.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:04 So I just improvised.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:10 With the help of.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:12 One moment.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:35 Manny.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:41 Xxmanny19
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:45 He helped me with it.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:44:53 And without the jet engines my build would not work.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:45:04 Along with the elevators not working my build is heavy asf for its size.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:45:28 And I'm already using the entire wing for control surfaces, just to be able to roll.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:45:54 Sorry if that ruins my build for you guys, it's just that I practically had no other choice if I wanted it to fly.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:47:16 Even so I'm not sure I have enough space to generate the controllable pitch.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:47:28 All my control surface space is used for the roll.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:47:49 And flaps aren't going to work for me.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:47:59 One thing I really really hate is motors on my wings.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:48:06 Or motors sticking out.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:49:01 Making sure there are no exposed motors > having the wings be reliable for pitch.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:49:07 looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:49:49 The horizontal stabilisers are kinda off?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:49:56 Not sure.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:50:00 Might just be camera angle.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:50:21 Vertical*
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:50:22 My bad.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:50:44 Make sure it is like /| and not /\
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:51:39 Hm, well there is basically no choice for me because the entire back portion is heavily motorlocked for aesthetical features.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:52:09 The engines also weld into my elevators the tiniest bit.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:52:37 And the stabilisers also weld in to make it look better.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:53:20 Hm.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:53:29 Either way.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:53:35 I'm open to feedback
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:53:49 I'm not expecting the build to be flawlessly liked.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:54:02 Just a fun project I took on.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:54:41 Looks good.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:55:44 Yeah I think some grayscale with accents might look pog on that but it's upto you.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:56:35 Time to make a stupid Vtol creation
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:56:37 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:56:40 should I?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:56:49 What should I make.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:57:13 Ice Cream Van fighter jet transformer?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:57:38 An icecream van that can spontaneously turn into a single seat twin engine multirole air superiority fighter?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:57:47 Nah might be too hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:57:52 looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:58:46 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:59:08 BAD BUILD YOU LITTLE WHITENAME 🤮
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:59:31 No but it actually looks cooler than any f18 I could build
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:59:46 a
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:59:46 I should make
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:05:05 what plane's intake design should I copy into my custom plane?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:05:15 I wanna make some sort of hybrid custom plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:05:29 Sure.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:05:49 True ^
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:05:51 Alright.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:06:03 The cockpit design is similar to the BAE systems tempest.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:06:44 I've had too much of that.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:11:29 This alright?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:11:33 brb

plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:38:43 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:38:53 Custom stealth fighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:40:46 yes
creations-chat 2021-09-28 06:44:50 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:46:12 ok what wing design should I use?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:46:37 Yf-23?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:46:41 Hmm.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 06:53:08 What you think about this wing design?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 10:58:50 Custom Su-75 Yf-23 stealth fighter hybrid
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 10:59:10 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 10:59:44 Thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 11:01:28 still looks great
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:22:16 What should I paint the cursed Yf-23 Su-74 hybrid?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:22:59 Anyone got any paint Ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:23:26 sigh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:23:31 anime waifu on it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:24:40 Laugh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:26:57 It's like a \_/ shape
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:27:02 on the inside
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:27:40 Right
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:35:32 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:35:38 Alright fixed it quite a bit.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:36:26 they are my feet
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:36:28 heh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:36:43 ok what paintjob does it need
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:39:09 Eh.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:39:23 The top of the intake needs to angle downwards.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:39:30 To form a < shape
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:39:59 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:40:42 Well from what I'm seeing.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:40:46 It varies?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:41:18 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:41:45 Huh what is this
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:41:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:42:33 "F15 Eagle air intakes are movable and change their angle during flight to give the optimal air flow for the engines under current conditions of airspeed, altitude, and throttle setting."
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:13 So it's variable.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:25 Nah, the top of the intake shifts down.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:41 
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:43 You see how the top is angled one side and not on the other.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:51 It's apparently used for optimal airflow.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:43:54 And stuff.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:08 huh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:21 oh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:26 i looked at it wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:38 yeah i think they're the same thing.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:52 I thought you mean the actual intake being offset angled to the main body.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:44:59 mb
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:45:30 ok what camo
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:45:35 for the hybrid stealth fighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:47:05 Probably my smoothest and most simple build.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:47:08 Flies well though.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:48:28 yo should I get the desginer 4 role
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:48:33 designer*
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:51:02 Turn my Su-57 into a VTOL fighter and Get VTOL 4?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:51:14 Then turn my Su-57 into a boat to get shipwright 4
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:51:26 Lol this is an excellent idea.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:53:39 Les Goo!
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:53:42 I pull up
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:54:06 you know everybody been waiting on that baby uh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:54:21 that whip had a cop in it
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:55:27 i got me a millie i did it legit-ly
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:55:53 i hop in it
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:55:54 uh uh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:56:43 👉 😁 👈
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:57:50 guys stalking is not cool
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:14:48 Same, other than the exposed motorlock it's a pretty nice build.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:23:11 Having pieces sticking out of the build makes it look worse, you can’t deny that. I don’t mind a bit of exposed motor lock but a lot of exposed blocks on a good build can ruin it. Plus it’s a personal opinion whether the build is good enough.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:36:41 Damn bro roblox moderation actually ass, got banned for saying the word gay once. That actually sucks.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:38:07 Huh?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:40:29 It does show some of the building skill that went into the build, but I mean, it can sometimes ruin a build so agree. On the Yak I was mega-tripping it still looks balling.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:42:32 Also <@!739850757305532458> , what do you mean?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:46:58 I’m not sure what’s wrong with my elevators though?
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:56:48 A day
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:31:40 I swear there are these 2 dudes who downvote any creation they see.
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:35:26 Yeah it’s the uh Print Screen, Cactus and Beeyow dudes, I did some digging.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:41:53 Lag machine crashed my game during a build.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:41:59 Praying for my save data.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:42:34 Might max out my Futuristic stealth fighter.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:42:40 Hopefully.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:44:17 What should I add?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:47:14 You like deez engines?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:49:19 I'm adding an internal weapons bay.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:52:25 Control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:52:52 In my opinion the control surfaces are a lot smoother and less touchy.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:59:49 Ok flares are a big no-go
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:59:59 they take up too much space so I can't really add them
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:03:57 what sides of the jet engine block stick/weld
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:04:17 brruhh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:21:03 anybody wanna see my internal weapons bay?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:21:15 kk 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:21:54 tis a bit hard to show but 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:22:19 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:22:27 Best I could get when the bombs are still in there.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:22:37 I'll release them first.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:23:18 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:23:28 And closed.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:26:05 f-15?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:26:19 Use a delta wing to angle the side of the intake.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:26:52 So the side looks like ╲
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:26:56 instead of |
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:27:25 Lock a delta wing half a block back
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:28:51 Screwdriver tool on camera
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:28:59 and then click on the block you want your camera facing.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:29:05 oh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:29:07 i wouldn't know
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:30:21 I've never done that because I'm way too lazy.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:30:31 feelsbadman
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:32:33 should I make a f-18 similar to my f-15
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:35:20 How this looking for the base of an f18 cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:36:18 huh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:37:01 which wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:37:36 At the nose?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:38:53 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:39:08 Decent?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:39:15 Also
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 04:39:21 I feel like the nose looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:03:21 How this wing design lookin?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:17:31 Good shape?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:17:58 I know, I just felt that control surfaces made it look better.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:19:10 not sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:19:26 i think more 1x1 surfaces is better?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:19:27 im not sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:19:35 same
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:20:07 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:22:13 The vertical stabilisers are so hard tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:22:29 f/a 18
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:22:56 It's angled and I need it to be locked in half a block.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:23:02 So there is gonna be a lot of exposed motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:23:42 Nah I mean the entire thing is slanted.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:23:58 So instead of being straight like the f-15 i made
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:23:59 it's
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:01 UGH
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:06 it's gonna be so painful.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:14 Exactly.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:20 Angle lock is fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:22 hiding the motor
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:25 on a thin build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:27 is hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:51 and now I realise
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:56 that the intakes are also slanted.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:24:58 which =
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:25:02 more angle locking!
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:26:12 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 05:26:17 It's so fuckin curvy

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:48:13 to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:54:07 Better?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:54:07 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:57:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:57:07 This is probably the finished project.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 10:57:25 Imagine detailing it 😩
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:01:12 ayo if that's yours show me more
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:01:18 I think it looks balling
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:02:04 holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:02:12 I've used 60 motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:02:15 in this
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:02:24 oh wait I have a tower
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:02:24 build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:03:26 tricky
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:03:30 the whole thing is curved
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:19:05 mine isn't accurate
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:19:13 also I might do the f-16 tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:19:31 my f-15 did pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:19:35 let me go check up on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:11 Basically 110-0
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:24 cause there is this 1 guy who keeps downvoting everybody's builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:33 I'm doing a marathon type thing.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:40 I did the mini f-15 yesterda
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:47 I did the f-18 today
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:20:52 might do f16 tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:24:20 You think it looks good? More details?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:54:22 fort
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:54:23 nite
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:54:36 Looks better than mine at least
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:54:47 the f15
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:07:34 
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:07:36 Good?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:16:26 Is it flat?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:16:32 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:17:32 I just cram all my motors into the 1 block of space, or get away lucky
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:18:14 In both of my builds I’ve had partial exposure like half of the grey head of the motor sticking through but I usually just incorporate it into the build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:18:24 Hidden or painted to look like detail
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:18:44 I can show you the one exposed motor lock I’ve had on my f15

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:03 Try to find the exposed motor
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:11 I tried to make it look like detail
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:13 But uh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:20:59 I tried to make it look like details on the intakes
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:21:04 But eh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:21:17 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:21:59 It’s like

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:23:47 An actually good build <:4Weird:709084058721714324> 
Lots of text, signs and cool afterburners <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 12:24:22 I’m convinced adding afterburners and random details = upvotes
creations-chat 2021-09-29 13:04:55 What else should I add to the f18
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:05:30 What should I add to the f18 before I post

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:06:19 Anything you see missing?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:06:53 Oops I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:08:00 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:08:10 Cowbell?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:49:54 ok uploaded the f-18f
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:49:58 nervous
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:50:06 another 1 day build but I'm not sure if it looks good

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:50:45 huh
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:51:27 its a 1 block wide build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:51:32 it's supposed to be 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:51:44 I make it at a scale that is 1 block wide lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:51:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:51:49 that would make it a 2 block build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:53:05 Yes but that’s not the point
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:53:21 I do not make 2 block builds, which is the challenge.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:53:42 I’m comfortable making it at a seperate scale and adding as much detail as possible at that scale.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:53:59 For now it is 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:54:29 :’(
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:54:40 Just trying to do the best I can
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:55:15 It’s made at a 1 block scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:55:27 How come I didn’t get any complaints for my f15
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:55:48 ?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:56:49 Plus this is plane crazy what do you expect
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:56:55 When I want to build at this scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:57:02 There are certain limitations
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:57:13 I can’t make perfect curvature.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:57:44 Thank you bro
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:57:53 Understandable I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:57:58 I did use lock system
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:58:08 But there is a certain level to what I can do
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:58:11 Sure angle locks
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:58:18 But that means exposed motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:58:48 Oh lol, I think that arises from the scale of the build, I think building a 1 block plane is fun.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 13:59:48 <@!720751430595772418> got any feedback for my build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:03:37 Ok what 1 block plane am I doing tomorrow?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:04:51 Yes the twin engine supermanuverable aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:05:04 Ok su 27

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:05:18 😩
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:05:24 And droop snoot
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:05:31 Nah I’ll make it work
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:05:35 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:11 Depending on the scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:13 I could
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:20 Do a droop snoot
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:28 With a wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:37 😀
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:50 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:07:54 But wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:08:02 How am I gonna hide the motor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:08:12 😩
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:08:49 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:08:53 Camera lock

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:12:58 How do I make the front of the wing of the su 27
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:13:04 It’s like curvy
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:13:19 Doesn’t it go up?
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:13:27 Maybe I’m stupid
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 14:13:39 Ah

creations-chat 2021-09-29 14:53:28 Good f22 I like the intakes, try to make the canopy smoother tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 01:37:24 Ago my f-18f did pretty well.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 01:37:33 Might do a su27 today
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:31:34 I still need to make one.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:31:39 Will do it now.

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:31:59 Yeah pretty nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:32:44 Did you use angle locks?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:33:37 Damn you pulled it off really well.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:34:52 Too good man
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:35:05 I might have to make mine at a larger scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:35:06 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:35:34 If you want, we can both do a cinematic shot and post it in creations when we're done.

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:20:27 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:20:32 Or should the wings be shorter?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:26:20 i feel like the wings should be shorter?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:26:29 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:26:47 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:26:50 Doesn't this look a bit long?

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:10:42 Good?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:10:52 because
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:10:55 1 block build
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:11:25 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:13:13 Intakes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:29:13 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:29:17 This wing better?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:32:22 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:32:23 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:36:24 Which wing looks better? For the right one I'll shorten the body, for the left I'll keep the body the same
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:37:25 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:37:28 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:37:34 Cause then the cockpit looks really short.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:41:28 This good?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:41:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:41:59 A bit thin.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:43:36 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:43:50 true
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 07:52:07 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:03:46 decent?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:07:38 Vtol
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:07:44 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:07:46 will look to fixing
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:13:36 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:13:38 Better exhaust?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:14:12 So it can rotate?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:14:15 In vtol mode
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:14:27 It's a 1 block wide build it's the best I can do.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:14:33 Not really without welding it.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:14:56 Haven't done the stabilisers.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:15:02 But the nose seems fine.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:15:15 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:15:18 And the intakes, agree?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:17:02 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:17:05 This good?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:17:11 Probably the best
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:17:29 But it doesn't look good on a side profile.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:20:56 Good canopy and nose?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:23:40 What should I do with the nose?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:29:59 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:30:02 Decent stabilisers?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:30:39 Ok time to fix the nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:40:56 Should I keep this a 1 block build or widen the nose?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:41:43 The nose is kept 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:41:47 and it's built from there.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:44:54 So keep 1 block or make wider?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:45:19 ????
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:49:01 Made 1 block wider.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:50:54 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:50:58 This is without the extra block
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:51:18 The thing is these intakes look a lot cleaner.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:52:56 so
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:52:56 But I'm not the one upvoting it
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:52:58 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:54:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:54:57 I think 1 block looks better from side angles.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 08:55:07 It just doesn't look that nice from a top view
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:11 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:17 I mean the intakes aren't big anyway.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:52 You can't really see them.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:57 I've already reverted.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:04:08 But you can't see the intakes, only like a little slit.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:05:20 Should I use Hover engines or super rocket engines for the Vtol?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:10:10 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:10:11 It works
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:35:27 They complain when I tell them to stop using lag machines because they are salty about their building skill.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:35:48 Lag machine users are just people who can't build, get annoyed, and take it out on others.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:37:46 Exactly.

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:46:36 He says he's making "a firework" and "idc"
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:46:44 He is unbelievably stupid and ignorant.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:46:57 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:47:46 He just lags it and resets.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:47:49 Lags and resets.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:49:10 All the lag machine users start crying when I insult them.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:49:15 What do you expect 🤷‍♂️
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:50:19 Bruh

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:51:21 It has working Vtol and moving engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:03:22 Stable asf
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:07:10 Does the nose look that bad?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:11:50 Good?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:17:53 yeah
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:20:06 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/893094764260491274/unknown.png
Is this better for a nose?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:23:31 What about this?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:43:43 I added an internal weapons bay.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:51:03 We do some decorating
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:53:23 They aren't?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:00:18 I mean it is pretty thick, and the intakes are a bit hard as I can't angle lock without having exposed motors and more trouble.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:02:38 I can kinda replicate that but at this 1 block wide nose scale I can't do too much.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:06:02 I mean I personally think it looks alright, and it works well.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:10:04 Also is the internal weapons bay alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:12:23 Not really, it would collide with pieces of my motorlock tower. Also, new jet https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/893108060783013908/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-09-30 14:49:09 Should I post the f-35 in creations?

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:11:33 It's a bit wierd I guess.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:11:39 weird*
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:26:08 Good idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:28:06 <@376049059695165440> got any feedback for my f-35

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:43:49 <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:46:56 True
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:47:14 It need to angle lock that, so I'll put it off for another day.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 15:47:26 But 100% agree
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:57:28 Joke
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:05:17 Good build, very good build
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:50:16 How do these f22 intakes look?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:50:30 1 block smaller?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 10:44:21 What intake looks better for the f22?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 10:46:09 What intake is good?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:03:31 These intakes look good?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:03:50 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:10:23 This wing design okay?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:11:59 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:12:03 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:12:18 So maybe use wedge 1x3 instead of 1x4?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:12:56 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:12:57 This good?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:13:29 Should I add Vtol for fun?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:13:37 actuall nah
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:13:43 thats what my f35 is for
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:13:49 vtol super fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:15:01 But you can just fit a bunch of engines inside of it with a rotating engine piece
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:15:10 That's not possible for f22 tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:17:59 F-35 was my most downvoted build.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:18:03 But it's my most fun build.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:18:11 I love my f-35.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:18:17 Especially the STOVL mode.
creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:48:16 How's it lookin so far?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:48:23 Looking good so far?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:49:53 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:49:58 I mean the engines are supposed to be quite short.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:19 I think my 1 block wide nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:23 Will look a lot better.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:25 On this build.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:31 Since it isn't fat.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:34 Like the f-35
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:50:36 kek
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:17 Imagine a community workshop.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:38 But it'd have to be like moderated.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:42 Or actually.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:14 It would be that you can only submit completely original creations, and you can't modify the creations from the workshop.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:22 Good idea.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:55 Not many F-22's have been made.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:54:00 my mom

creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:56:50 It won't once I've done the elevators
creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:59:34 I haven't done them, go to <#384021699466756107>  this slowmode annoying
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:00:08 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:00:10 Stabilisers done.
creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:02:20 Less gap* between the main wing and elevators, and the elevators may need to be a bit bigger, other than that, maybe move the engine upwards as well as the stabiliser. Good job either way!
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:11:57 Looks good and proportional?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:12:14 wait I need to fix the elevators
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:18:27 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:18:30 Bigger elevators?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:18:41

creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:57:59 Tried very hard and used 6 motors to move them back but it didn't work well, and caused a bunch of exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:00:23 This is it 1 block back thought (Right)
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:02:47 Thats the plan haha

plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:09:44 Grey?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:12:50 New nose good?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:13:51 You posted? It's sad when you have to be that toxic because somebody cannot build as well as you, it takes another level of stupidity to not understand that people have different skills, and levels of what they think is good. It is hard for the "noobs" to improve when met with such a toxic attitude. Sure posting in creations gives you downvotes, but that is feedback, not utter rudeness. Everybody starts somewhere.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:16:51 that was a joke
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:17:56 Man I dislike people sometimes.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:19:10 The only thing about my Su-57 that I liked was the exhause nozzles
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:20:10 Good Idea.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:20:55 ok what colour of grey should I paint it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:21:18 imagine having good builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:21:21 could not relate
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:21:29 :-(
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:21:32 I make crappy 1 block builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:22:08 Time to make half block wide cargo planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:23:21 Su-57 nose keeps me awake at night
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:26:25 It took me 3 hours to do my su-57 nose, and I changed only a few blocks and it doesn't look clean.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:46:51 Good paint?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:48:03 Yeah I'm just trying to make 1 block wide builds.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:48:41 I think my other 1 block builds turned out well.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:56:31 another internal weapons bay
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:00:03 This cockpit alright?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:00:17 Or make it less steep at the front
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:01:47 I'm trying to make it 1 block wide intentionally.
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:25:21 Decent?

plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:58:06 imo ww2 planes are overhyped
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:59:10 I think this is my most detailed build
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:59:12 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 14:59:20 It's the smallest but it has the highest block count.

creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:35:11 Proportions look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:37:26 I mean it is supposed to be at a 1 block wide nose scale so is it reasonable?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:40:15 Uh they're not very good but uh they are 2 half wedge downs with some motorlocked wing panels.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:46:30 Making fun jets > Making good jets.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:05:04 Should the next 1 block wide plane I make be an a10 warthog?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:28:07 Could I see it?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:30:57 Yeah it looks really good apart from a few little motors. Awesome build.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:33:32 Does this A10 nose look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:36:54 Does this warthog nose look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:45:19 Any better? Nvm a10 can be for another day.
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:59:52 exposed motors a lot of the time end up making a build hideous, only in some cases is it alright for the build
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:00:25 nice
creations-chat 2021-10-02 09:02:13 not for you lol, your build is epic
creations-chat 2021-10-02 09:38:48 This f4 cockpit look alr?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:38:57 Is this f4 cockpit alright?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:40:03 My first attempt.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:40:06 Making an f4.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:45:31 Just put 2 trails behind each other
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:45:51 and set them to 0.03 length and 0.3 transparency.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:46:01 The one further out should be set to 120 120 255
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:46:07 and the inner 1 should be 255 128 00
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:47:25 I feel like this is the best I can do for the f-4 canopy
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:48:42 I don't wanna bother anybody.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:48:49 hmm

creations-chat 2021-10-02 10:50:38 No offense but the idea of creating a giant blue diamond isn't going to be accepted by the pcc
creations-chat 2021-10-02 11:07:25 How the intakes lookin?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:21:41 Does it look alright?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:21:47 cries in canted intakes.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:21 The intakes are entirely angled.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:23 It's easy.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:24 But.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:28 Making it blend well.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:30 Can be difficult.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:32 Not to mention.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:44 Having moving wing pieces results in an almost definite exposed motor.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:22:52 And exposed motor = unacceptable.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:25:46 engines better?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:34 I feel like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:36 looks better
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:44 wobble is caused by hover engines for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:48 or going too fast
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:36:41 This aight for the wings?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:37:27 why not
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:39:58 Is this more reasonable.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:41:39 
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:41:42 yeah uh
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:41:55 ok i'm finishing production on the f-4 phantom.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:42:02 f-4 phantom is no more
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:45:10 unfortunately.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:45:32 but I think that's due in part to the amount of time I spend building and messing around
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:45:36 or the type of build
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:45:43 like the f-15 was just really easy
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:45:51 and it was small
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:46:03 but with my f-22 it has to be big for detail.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:46:04 and
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:46:07 i think it looks alright.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:46:57 why does it spawn like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:47:04 2 gears down 1 gear up
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:47:07 this is pain
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:50:21 I feel like this looks alright.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:51:03 
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:51:06 This is my old one
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:51:35 I think I'm just doing this because of the amount of stress the su-57 caused me
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:52:00 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:52:04 nothing else important in my life
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:52:28 it's school holidays and I'm pretty crapped out
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:52:42 i spend a lot of my day just listening to the same song for a few hours straight while playing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:52:50 my builds are kinda falling off
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:17 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:22 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:28 roblox is boring now
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:35 i feel like i've maxed out any fun game
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:39 but plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:54:41 is different
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:55:55 build a su-57 with vectoring thrust and levcons
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:07 😭
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:38 should I make a cylinder cockpit!?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:46 I feel like that would be a good idea.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:59:32 i feel bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:59:36 all my builds are falling to shit
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:59:43 and I'm not gonna fix them
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:00:37 ok time to make the complete opposite of what I was making
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:00:48 no more 1 block wide builds >:)
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:16:08 im gonna make a big plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:18:49 instead of a 1 block wide nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:19:00 im making a massive plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:49:36 This look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:51:19 What should I make it?
1. Cargo Plane.
2. Large winged modern bomber.
3. Custom Gunship.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:51:31 Custom gunship, bomber, or cargo plane.
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:51:46 jk it's an f22
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:52:39 massive f22 intakes on it
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:52:54 probably gonna make it a gunship
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:55:20 nah fighter jet it is 😎
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:56:49 how thick should the wings be
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:56:54 a block or a wing panel?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:57:34 yeah that's a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:57:44 I can't without angle locks
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:57:54 And I'm trying to use 0 motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:59:39 How big should the wingspan be? Massive, regular, or smol?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:59:51 and how long should it be?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:00:01 should it be like b52 long boy
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:00:03 or
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:00:05 normal
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:15:15 Good fuselage?

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:33:54 both wings are done, good?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:36:30 🥵

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:04 i gave them bigga
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:26 Its a less narrow c17 wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:48 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:56 Should I make them bigger?
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:38:35 hmmm

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:46:34 How does the custom gunship look in terms of proportions
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:49:23 Does it look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 05:49:28 Good?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:28:18 Custom gunship, also, working opening
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:33:52 Oh crap I just realised the cockpit isn't supposed to go up, but I'm trying to get some sort of access to the inside, as the rear is very very difficult to do.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:36:11 I'm going to try to get the rear to work but idk if it's going to be pretty
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:46:04 Making a working back door is really really difficult, god help me.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:31:24 Does the side view look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:33:41 That's pretty necessary because it moves.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:38:41 I think it looks alright, but I might extend it further.
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:02:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:02:23 im still working on my gunship
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:02:45 Working back door.

creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:05:43 What type of engines should I use? Turboprop or Jet?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:05:54 What type of engines should I use?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:06:29 I mean.
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:06:34 What they look like
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:07:34 Like jet or propeller
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:15:06 I'll use something artificial, but I'm talking about for the wings, for looks.
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:15:18 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:18:22 cylinders

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 14:10:35 Does the opening look alright?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 14:10:44 After I detail it It'll probably look better
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:12:41 Motor lock another jet engine behind it.

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 04:37:19 sugonda nuts
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 04:37:29 🤣
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 04:39:56 both, make a skull pattern if you want.
creations-chat 2021-10-04 05:26:39 Very nice.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:45:44 some dude in VIP1 is lagging the server claiming to be rickje. Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:46:31 
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:47:13 Yeah the entire server is pretty much crashed,
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:48:13 Who's that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:49:26 Well he's basically broken the server.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:49:58 And he has access to the discord chats.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:50:09 So he is active in this channel.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:51:48 yeah he broke the server
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:52:26 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/873847232762351657
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:52:34 This dude messaged the exact same tag.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:53:30 It's an expired ping.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:53:40 He pinged him but the account is no longer here or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 05:53:43 Not sure.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:00:21 So just a hacker alt ruining the server?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:00:26 Claiming to be Rickje?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:04:08 And he crashed my game.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:04:24 There goes my save data.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:04:26 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:05:00 Cause it wasn't really that bad.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:05:05 My frames were at 60
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:05:09 and then it just stopped.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:05:24 I think it just broke the server.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:12:53 You should pvp me in VIP 1 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 06:13:18 I have a truck, a special kind of truck.
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:01:41 only update I want is to stop being spawned in the cockpit for christs sake
general 2021-10-04 08:37:30 It's a pusher goddamnit
general 2021-10-04 08:37:36 but yeh
general 2021-10-04 08:37:38 it's weak
general 2021-10-04 08:37:44 i'm not into all that glitchy stuff
general 2021-10-04 08:38:00 Your one glitched me out, but I can't really replicate it
general 2021-10-04 08:38:01 sad
general 2021-10-04 08:38:01 so
general 2021-10-04 08:38:18 i tried :(
general 2021-10-04 09:33:51 Lmk if hacker is still in the private server
general 2021-10-04 09:34:00 I’m looking forward to pushing him off the map
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:52:39 Su 34 is just obese nose Sukhoi plane
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:56:21 Agreed,
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:59:28 Yeh lacks detail, looks kinda basic, but it ain’t bad
creations-chat 2021-10-06 09:01:52 Yeah add details like lights and stuff seems pretty simple to do. WIP Project?
creations-chat 2021-10-06 09:06:46 What was the crappy plane you guys were talking about earlier? I don’t really see it anywhere.
Oh deleted.
creations-chat 2021-10-08 09:02:46 nice f22
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:03:23 Make the tip of the nose a bit more bulbous, alr, still a good build
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:05:59 The tail is off, I’m pretty sure the fuselage goes straight, not down at the tail
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:08:25 Wait never mind, it goes down at the slightest angle, maybe try angle locking a piece?
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:10:29 Angle lock a row of blocks and wedges to slope down at the back for a slight continuous slope.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:35:13 Smokestack is disproportionate, the details look out of place and incorrect, there is a lack of detail, and the colours also look off. If I’m going to be completely honest, I couldn’t recognise it as the picture whatsoever.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:49:47 Yeah no detail guns look off and generally looks bad
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:54:12 Attach it to the top of a dusty Fed Ex van
creations-chat 2021-10-10 10:03:24 agreed, and I thought the plane looked bad with a good paintjob.

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:04:26 I think one of the angles makes it look fat
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:21:55 This is the first UAV in my collection, what design should I use in my next one?

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:41:06 Soaring dragon.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:45:31 the colour scheme looks like a nerf gun, it would be great camouflage in a Spiderman birthday party.
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:45:46 make 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:45:47 haha

creations-chat 2021-10-11 10:45:32 Also the boat looks very blocky and generally plain, so maybe make some improvements?
creations-chat 2021-10-11 12:11:49 That’s a very good ratio based on how the build looks.
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:14:22 They just mad because it looks so good
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:14:33 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:15:01 I don’t think that worked
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:15:42

creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:07:37 Can I get a hall of fame for 150 score?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:12:46 Yeah to be honest it might not be that great of a build
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:46:03 I wish I had sparkler rn. Ugh this is so annoying.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:48:15 I could but I need it to be 2 blocks long without the bases on it
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:57:35 You haven't seen my thicc custom battleship, have you? Your ship is godly in comparison.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:00:05 I'm working on it rn
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:08:36 It's not going well.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:16:29 Do the turrets look alright other than paint?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:28:27 I'm basing it off a south dakota battleship, but I'm trying to modify it because of motorlocking issues and fatness.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:32:54 I should probably fold it, right?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 11:41:18 Better?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 11:44:42 Reference
creations-chat 2021-10-17 12:43:53 South dakota so far. The 2nd turret is wrong but who cares.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 12:47:37 It makes it a symmetrical.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 12:50:37 a-symmetrical*
creations-chat 2021-10-17 12:59:27 It's a cool idea but to be completely honest it doesn't look very nice
creations-chat 2021-10-17 13:07:39 Custom South dakota inspired battleship, looking good so far?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 13:24:00 More improvements.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 13:26:43 Yeah.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 13:44:26 This is how far I've come in a few hours, time to go.
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 13:45:38 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 13:45:50 I will add more detail later.
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 13:45:53 sleep time
creations-chat 2021-10-17 14:59:50 A good build ||jk jk more detail||
creations-chat 2021-10-17 15:02:07 More shaping to the feet, and maybe some trails and shapes here and there for detail, its a good build nonetheless but if you have intentions of posting it then you might need more detail for acceptance. **The back looks pretty solid, adding more stuff is up to you**
creations-chat 2021-10-18 08:25:54 Good proportions?
creations-chat 2021-10-18 08:28:20 Reference, also barely any details are done. Thanks Weep

creations-chat 2021-10-20 11:30:14 hahahhah 😐
creations-chat 2021-10-20 11:33:33 I'm kidding, pretty cool.
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 11:38:06 Upgraded the turrets.
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 11:47:57 older planes are overhyped
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 11:48:48 F4 is overhyped :-)
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 11:49:08 Everybody and their mother has an F-4.
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 11:49:34 Nice.
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 12:28:14 I improved a bit.
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 12:28:57 indeed
creations-chat 2021-10-20 12:29:05 Good?

plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:42:27 F-15 is a lot easier than f-22's in my opinion.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:42:33 A lot more straight angles.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:43:27 Hm.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:44:01 Fair enough.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:44:17 I think I made a smaller scale one.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:46:14 Nice.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:46:28 I never posted my f-22 because it honestly looks pretty crap.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:47:38 
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:47:41 This is the front.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:47:44 I hate my nose.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:47:58 Eh, it looks alright I guss.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:48:03 But the nose really bothers me.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:48:09 It just looks very off.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:48:20 I guess it might just be hard to nail at this scale?
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:49:11 The back and no.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:49:14 They don't.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:49:33 I had to motorlock them heavily and it ended up not working.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:49:45 It works in my larger builds but at this scale I don't have that type of skill.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:50:53 The intakes also look ugly.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:51:34 He's just more skilled than me.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:52:00 I might be able to make them slightly functional but I don't wanna spend that time on my builds.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:52:12 I just take a day or two and push them out.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:53:14 My first boat 🤣
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:55:11 The pain machine.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:55:27 Nose is bad but the top view looks alright.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:55:48 No thrust vectoring on mine either because of motorlocking, again.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:58:18 
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:58:22 I'm not sure about this one.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:58:29 Gonna continue on my boat.
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:58:46 Should I make the flooring or whatever on the boat wood or grey?
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 11:00:28 Does the colour scheme look alright?
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 11:06:15 What colours do you think I should do?

help 2021-10-22 11:00:58 why tf will the game not let me place a wedge in this exact spot, it keeps phasing into other blocks and even when I reset and respawn my build I can't place a block there.
creations-chat 2021-10-22 11:02:17 All you know is that it's low effort and I think it is very, very trash, and it might be deleted for being such low effort.
help 2021-10-22 11:02:58 Ah, I could've used that but I already rejoined and it's working.
help 2021-10-22 11:08:53 Not sure.

plane-crazy 2021-10-22 11:19:13 Can I piston lock with half pistons?
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 11:19:44 Both really, if you need help on a WIP build that's perfect

plane-crazy 2021-10-22 14:18:49 Hard to cram in detail.
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 14:18:57 Cause of exposed motors and stuff.

plane-crazy 2021-10-23 12:44:25 Should I make a delta-winged Su-57?
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 12:45:47 Maybe a Eurofighter with regular wings?
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 12:45:57 Or an f-18 with Delta wings.

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 03:47:58 thats the dollarfighter heavywind
creations-chat 2021-10-24 03:49:36 Yeah, slightly modified and repainted
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 04:05:07 Looks like something out of avatar.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:32:19 Good?

creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:37:08 Yeah it looks a bit too thick

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 04:39:43 Lies
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 04:48:06 why are the motors always so annoying to turn
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 04:48:11 they keep glitching back
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 04:48:13 is this a bug?

creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:16:56 That's madvulpen's tutorial, he added some things on the end of the wing segments and called it his own.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:20:02 Fair nuff
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:25:27 In my opinion, you should probably classify it, and convert it to be a Slow Flying VTOL Gunship. <@!738064035135750224>

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:29:43 Bigger and a few more upvtoes
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:30:37 Maybe I just do the f-15 for the HoF.
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:30:44 Switch up the norm,
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:30:47 with smaller jets
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:31:26 You can do anything

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:31:51 I'm joking.
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:32:34 You reckon they would like the F-15?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:32:44 Alright.
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:33:00 I'd probably need it to be bigger, right?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:33:26 Yes, they lack big acceptance of small builds 😭
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:33:49 :)
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:06 It's not about the size, it's about what you do with it.
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:11 Mine has thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:24 ah, I see
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:37 I should make a comedic f-15.
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:43 With multiple rows of weaponry,
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:34:57 I think I have an idea
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:35:03 they asked for a bigger build

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:52:41 Should I make the Mig-25?

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:54:23 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:54:45 Looks basic
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:54:48 I'm trying to get HoF
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 05:56:45 And I can't really do 5th or 6th gens because they are basic and most of them are boring.

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 07:31:31 u ripped off the drakula skin from fortnite
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:26:41 Good looking mig 29 spine and nose?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:28:48 For sure on the group pic, also do you mean a flat surface before the nose slope?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:31:07 Alright, thanks
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:33:17 Sukhoi just mig 29 on a diet. Also it's hard to custom angle this nose as I need another angle lock on the exact same settings and the motors are too glitchy for both to say on the exact same level and angle. Like the entire nose is angle locked right, and to add a custom nose, I'd need a seperate angle lock.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:37:03 Yeah I can record a clip of this angle locking not working because the motors are so glitchy.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:39:35 ok it worked, looking good?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:47:52 Looking good? and also <@!682147422218223616>  that's looking pretty nice, idk about the cockpit and angle but maybe I've just got poor interpretation
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:51:24 its kinda like how you see things, like I'm not good at understanding or knowing the su-30 proportions
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:53:26 Another motorlock behind it that's higher. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/902147788245180416/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:01:57 Didn't you also do this for your su-30? oh.
Also I just realised that the Mig - 29 is just a su-30 and f-15 lovechild.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:53:41 You like?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:57:06 looks about right, how r u going <@!682147422218223616> wait 2 mins this blueprint looks bad

creations-chat 2021-10-26 09:17:23 Does this look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-26 09:22:46 Yeah the spine was too short and now it's too long.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:04:58 <@!567763933952475157>
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:05:06 
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:05:55 It doesn't look too curved to me, idk.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:06:37 Maybe very slightly, but I think most of the curve is from the thickness sloping down.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:06:42 Not the actual wing being angled.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:16 It doesn't look too curved.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:19 Maybe slightly.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:27 No clue.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:38 Either way.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:40 It looks good.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:54 Maybe curve it a bit less.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:07:58 But other than that.
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 10:08:03 It's an awesome f-18

These intakes look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-26 11:35:00 3d intakes are cool
if you're skilled
 and i think i need more space for my vert stabilisers too
creations-chat 2021-10-26 12:51:11 Did my best and there are basically no exposed motors, although the back looks kinda messy.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 06:58:53 Mig 29 or 35, which do you like more?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 08:15:05 Mhig 29
creations-chat 2021-10-27 08:44:31 I'd rather not as I'm low on space on my angle lock for more motorlocks, do you think this nose could pass?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 08:52:48 Lol I like building stuff, it's the joy in building that motivates me, it brings me a lot of happiness making builds to be proud of and share with others.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:15:42 1 block with half blocks on either side which is 2
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:50:30 Side view
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:56:17 Should I add armaments to the Mig?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:59:43 Unfortunately it can't be without having exposed motors and general ugliness, jus trying to keep it as clean as possible.
general 2021-10-27 10:05:49 hi?
general 2021-10-27 10:05:57 oh you're in my server
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:07:42 This is the space I'm working with right now, so for now my mig is just the 29a which has a shorter spine
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:10:33 <@!766841196534169612> Pls fix the cheese grater wings if you can, still an upvote for pro jet.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:12:54 Do you want to see the wings? I'm not sure I understand.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:15:51 Ignore the colour bug, I will fix that. <@!755389462443458611> What do you think?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:19:29 so good or no? <@!755389462443458611> ?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:22:49 I thought I made a mig 29? Does it just look like a 35? Alright, I'll probably just stick with a Mig 29a because that's what I modelled it off.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 10:32:59 Mig 29 > Su - 30
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:37:57 I see, thanks

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:47:46 Cri
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:48:04 But the big blocky part on it looks more than hideous.
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:51:45 The intakes look good.
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:57:46 How are the missiles looking?
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:58:13 I hate them.
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:59:46 Yeah Idk what to do
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:59:51 I don't have sparklers.

creations-chat 2021-10-28 08:38:38 show us the plane then
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:09 are we doing it in expert vip 1
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:18 i'm crying about my non-functional airbrakes
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:23 I hate this game so much
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:32 I tried to make functional and realistic airbrakes.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:46 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:30:47 I tried to do this
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:31:08 Trap doors small :(
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:31:27 sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:31:31 spawned or not?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:31:56 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:32:19 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:32:57 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:06 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:19 I had the internal for the airbrakes done
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:30 but the actual functionality didn't work
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:39 And i don't want exposed motor lock because that's bad.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:52 What are you doing, step mig?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:33:57 That was a joke.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:34:46 When the supermanuverable twin engine multirole fighter is showing signs of sceptical behaviour.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:35:25 Imagine exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:35:26 its like
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:35:38 639
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:35:42 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:36:08 more block = more skill
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:36:13 thats why I get low block counts
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:36:29 If you make a really big build, there is no need for motorlock imo
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:36:38 Unless it's a ship.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:37:00 If you have a massive 2 fold Mig, it's gonna be pretty good.
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 10:38:10 Mig 31 is so intimidating

creations-chat 2021-10-28 12:07:54 You do realise if I were to be in the cockpit, my arms would stick out the sides, giving people a better reason to downvote it. Also don't be dog, you're downvoting a build I tried well on just because it is French?
creations-chat 2021-10-28 12:10:09 Alright, you do you then.
creations-chat 2021-10-28 12:14:52 The irony.
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 06:39:50 is roblox just down?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 06:40:12 shit
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 06:40:16 that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 07:28:18 I'm still bugged by people that downvote for no reason.

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:00:59 Stop posting stuff here
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:19:43 <@456226577798135808> Why you downvoting all the builds?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:20:41 You're hating on the build?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:20:49 You think the build is bad?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:20:53 I'm not mad.
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:21:35 If he says that it's bad, then why would he post his builds thinking they're good?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:21:49 Bruh.
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:21:56 So downvoting means you love the build?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:22:07 It's supposed to be a sign that you dislike the build, or it is bad.
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:22:25 What else are they for?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:22:41 Bro doesn't know how the voting system works.
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:22:50 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:23:21 Why would you downvote it tho?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:23:39 It's almost always used to show negative feedback?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 09:23:45 Not almost always.

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 06:59:42 Yo <@723940197456281640> , what paintjob you think I should try for the mig? Should we all do something matching?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:05:47 I was thinking like a type of yellow, or like yellow stripe on one of the wings, but the rest idk.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:06:09 Like a greenish or yellowish colour.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:06:45 Both look off, try to make it in between both types. If I had to choose the first is better.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:06:54 The one in the middle is the best
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:07:16 Nose also looks sus
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 07:07:39 You should show me a side view.

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:06:45 Does this look hof worthy?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:06:55 I just submitted it and I'm having a nervous breakdown
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:09:43 It's fair enough if it doesnt make it
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:09:49 because it's a very small build
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:09:55 and
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:10:01 i can understand if they don't think of it as good
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:10:16 because I don't really think it's "extraordinary" myself.

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:50:50 
creations-chat 2021-11-01 10:53:13 Tried to get it close, idk if it looks similar
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 10:53:23 looks good
creations-chat 2021-11-01 11:02:47 Yeah I was going for the top one
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:19:32 I made a huge photoshoot collection of all my planes in the night.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:19:44 I've been working on it for the past few weeks.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:21:09 You wanna make it long slope at the front
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:21:15 And then flatten out a bit
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:21:23 and then a bit of a harsher slope at the end.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:23:29 Decent <@!721103577380159490>
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:24:57 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:24:59 Something like this?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:06 But the front is angle locked with large slopes
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:17 So it's a custom slope
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:31 It's hard to do it with only 1x4s
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:42 1x4s usually aren't sloped enough
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:52 im not experienced in boats
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:25:58 yeah lol mine looks a bit

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:35:46 I did the South Dakota as it has a simple hull design
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:35:52 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:36:02 Literally flat and one long slope
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 11:36:06 and the back is kinda round

creations-chat 2021-11-01 11:54:51 old games are always a lot better than this new stuff, I'm still in love with those old rpg and adventure games, especially the ones you'd have to grind a long time to beat.
creations-chat 2021-11-01 11:58:51 (insert generic simulator) 5 is all you see on the front page, or those weeb games

Plane crazy is great because it takes a lot more to be proud of your achievements than just autoclicking and repetition.

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:40:08 It’s super comedic, don’t you think?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:40:32 You have a grudge against people?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:40:59 It’s not just me, I’ve seen you as the only person downvoting certain builds.

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:47:59 I could go on because there are so many instances.
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:48:49 And my point is that it’s just toxic to mass downvote, plus I want to know the motive behind it.
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 06:50:41 Should do the same with the PrintScreen guy

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:00:31 You like the wing paint?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:01:17 What needs to be less steep?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:01:34 Blue?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:01:48 The blue segment?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:02:42 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:02:59 idk what to do for the body
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:05:13 Does this look nice?
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:05:35 This better?
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:08:07 Similar but I'm trying to make it original.
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:08:41 I reckon this looks best
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:11:06 The upper part is essential, as it needs to be a uniform level due to the blend into slopes, it's difficult to understand but it offsets the paint by 0.25 blocks and usually makes it look a bit ugly.
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:14:12 Also the lower part is very difficult as the turn sits in between 2 1x4 wedges that make the rear shape.
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:18:48 Slight improvement?
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:23:06 Perhaps, I'm kinda trying to go for the russian flag

creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:09:45 <@719168864705052802> any reason for the downvote on my f16?
creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:14:30 I just want feedback for my plane, I tried my best to make it look good qnd I'd like to Improve on anything that seems wrong.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:54:46 Although hars has a lot better builds than me, I wonder why he downvoted my f-16? I don't see anything noticeably wrong with it, and it would be great if he told me what was wrong with it.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 08:00:37 I thought I basically added everything and no exposed motorlocks or pistons? maybe he just doesn't like the build or photos generally which is fine ig
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:01:49 What plane am I doing next
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:01:56 I think the f-16 turned out well so what's next
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:02:04 Could convert it into F-2
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:02:34 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:04:57 Is my build still too small for HOF?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:04:58 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:05:11 Trying my best to get a small build hof worthy

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:06:24 I added guns and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:06:33 And afterburner and canted intake
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:07:01 I think the photo angles I posted weren't very good in showing the plane off, but they were cinematic
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:07:12 Might post some more in a few days
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:07:19 You think people would like that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:08:53 maybe I should make 1 block wide a-10?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:08:58 You think that would look good?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:09:37 I'm really gunning for a HOF build.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:09:46 My mirage failed and I don't think my f-16 can make it.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:10:19 I think it's fine that they don't like lower detailed small builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:10:24 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:12:04 Maybe I make F-16 XL?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:12:09 Should I?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:13:33 still don't know what I should build
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:14:30 Don't think I can make it as good as yours

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:36:44 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:36:48 I could send you a clip
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:36:59 I rotate anything and it immediately locks back
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:37:40 well I'm going to do something very bad if it happens again
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:37:49 I'm going to do something that I will most definitely regret
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:37:55 😠

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 12:18:03 Time to make thrust vectoring Airbus A330
creations-chat 2021-11-09 12:22:11 Thicker nose height or at least sloped at the bottom, as well as this, the intake looks very off, similarly with the cockpit, but you’ll get it right over time, no hate just keep working hard.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 12:27:31 Tutorial, it gonna get deleted
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:25:32 Gap is meant to be there, I can’t overdo my engines without exposed motor lock, the half wedges connect to the fuselage almost perfectly, and the landing gear is literally implemented in the game so why not use it? I feel you’re nitpicking and downvoting anything that you see a slight gap in, plus everything you do and say is kinda pricky. You make good builds but you’re quite literally annoying for no reason.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:28:00 Yes but I think your opinion is incredibly harsh and unjust 😀

Reference for the gap, also calling my fuselage “fucked” is a bit off because it looks pretty accurate for the scale of my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:30:55 I worked my ass off at this scale, and you expect me to have the level of detail and perfection of a build 3 times the size, but if I try and have exposed motor lock you’ll still downvote?
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:34:32 He does have the best planes, but I don’t like it when people start sending hate for the tiniest of things. If you try your best on something and you spend 3 nights getting the photos right, you won’t really like other people criticising the build for the smallest things. I wasn’t here when he called my build fucked. Hars I know you can do that, but you’re a lot better than me, I still don’t get how you downvotes for a slight gap and my use of a certain block.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:36:54 Plus I only have use of half wedges for the armaments, anything else looks awful, and motorlocking runs the risk of exposed motors and cramped space in my unloaded build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:49:42 But half the stuff in the criticism is just nitpicking, the other half is actually supposed to be on the plane, and sutff that I really can't do at the scale, I'm just salty ig, but I'm also passionate about my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:51:47 Would be fine if he had a good reason, and some parts he did, but he went further to call my build "fucked" and was generally a bit rude which I didn't really like. i also don't believe that the things he mentioned should've lead to such a negative reaction, but he does him ig.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:56:21 It's like if I downvoted his good build for having an exposed motor head
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:00:24 What
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:10:15 It's not bullying, hars had a point but he was kinda annoying about it, and half the things he told me were shit were basically unable to be fixed without exposed motor
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:13:27 He has but Im not hating for it, also you're just starting another argument you oddly shaped brainlet
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:16:32 But every time you message you just continue it by calling my builds shit, not even mad at hars anymore, you need to 🤐. Also double as much as I respect you, please stop sucking hars' toes, I was just mad at him nitpicking and being a prick by calling my build shit and fucked, he was being a Simon  Cowell.
creations-chat 2021-11-10 06:36:22 finished crying to realise a lot of what hars said was true 😭

creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:55:32 <@!401530469952389130> Add some yellow and details to the rotor as well as half cylinders in front of the intake
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:00:29 Ah, yeah some half cylinder in front of the intake would look nice
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:02:42 <@!401530469952389130> The body shape is all there, but you can do a lot better if you add more details here and there, because it looks kinda standard rn.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:08:07 make the brownish colour darker, also can I see the intake?
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:14:57 Use half cylinder 2x2s down the bottom, and piston lock one half cyl 2x2 0.1 outwards and 0.3 upwards using pistons at the front to create the black part.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:19:44 make the brown darkerrr tooo
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:36:41 whats with the intake wings and engine and smoothness and why is it the colour of the floor
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:51:27 That's cracked, the details make it look soo good
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:54:12 <@!702907851001167882> If that ain't HOF, idk what is, I truly honour the amount of effort and detail that went in that, seriously a 11/10 build, still in awe.

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 10:01:25 or should I repost with better angles and upgrade and then do it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 10:02:13 True
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 10:02:21 Small builds need more respect for what they're worth
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 10:02:38 The choice to make small builds should be respected although bigger is a possibility if you get what I mean

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:28:50 baguette being mad again :(

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 13:47:40 Because it features intake weaponry, but not the fuselage of the V variant
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 13:47:55 And the rest is F-16 C with PJ's details like the heart.

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 14:02:49 I'm still breathtaken by the amount of detail on that thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 14:03:15 He would have to angle lock individual wing panels and cylinders, and more panels in the center
creations-chat 2021-11-13 14:03:57 I would've been able to pull it off quite a bit better if I had sparklers, but I'm kinda limited to this shit for now.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 14:06:33 the wire pieces on the sides are all angle locked trails that have also been angled to sit flush with the wedges.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 14:06:43 Holy shit im still being blown away
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 14:11:43 i angle locked everything on my f-16 and when I have 900 ping and motors start glitching I actually want to hurt something

creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:44:14 Try to angle half wedges solely to sit alongside your wedge piece, or have the whole top portion angle locked half blocks and wedges.

creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:37:41 Paint armament blue?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 12:01:35 .it's flat and fat and the colours are kinda off, also, the ship needs to narrow down to a point towards the bottom and generally be more out of the water.
creations-chat 2021-11-14 12:07:23 nose is short and stubby, the intakes are too square and small with no pointy thing, and the cockpit shouldn't be on that level where it's submerged below the angle of the nose.

This Falken looks crazy impressive at this scale

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:09 Yeah tone the colour and material variation down and it'll look great

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 13:28:34 wait what's wrong with the nose? I'll fix it up
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 13:48:08 With the small gap if blue its almost impossible at this scale cause I'd have to basically angle lock a sign or something. Also with the half wedge and the half wedge 1x2 it makes the cockpit seem boring and off, and it makes my entire cockpit too short and throws off my scaling.

plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:31:29 I don't think my build can
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:31:56 There has to be some consideration for the size of my build limiting my motor locking capabilities and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:32:04 I could add so much more but I have no space
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:32:11 Yeah that was a scam
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:32:32 The f-16 you posted was absolutely beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:37:35 I probably don't have much of a chance, but who knows
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:37:38 ill add more tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:39:16 Bigger builds seem a lot easier to detail and add detail to.
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:40:22 I feel like the size you make a build should be considered when they assess the detail, having a bit less detail than a build 2 or 3 times your size should be somewhat reasonable.
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:41:37 I feel like this should've been in HOF instead of the F-18

creations-chat 2021-11-19 23:57:38 is this low effort?

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 01:45:15 better than my other f-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 01:50:56 does it look overdone?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 01:51:13 or maybe underdone
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 01:52:11 Nope, they would be too difficult and would make exposed motors + not enough room for it to be functional
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 01:52:21 but i do have gear doors and accurately angled gears
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 02:12:09 This is what I got
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 02:12:36 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 02:12:40 That looks good

creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:01:42 Not gonna be able to, <#384025409945337856> doesn't allow low effort <- obviously a joke
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:04:19 I can't, none of my build have enough blocks
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:07:24 It's at like 1400 blocks rn
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:09:29 More blocks than my su-57 but like less than half the size.

I have 4 seperate motorlock towers.
 <@!702907851001167882> is that possible?
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:13:59 i don't think thats fair, I don't have enough blocks and the F-2 isn't really that super special, but maybe
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:17:10 how do you get modeler or inventor?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:18:49 so modeler is just making a really good unique thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:18:56 like HOF level unique thing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:19:20 What is inventor tho?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:19:23 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:20:00 Ah, so like the person who figured out how to motorlock.

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:29:21 I just don't wanna be in the fuselage or cockpit because it throws off the details
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:29:57 Yeah I fly for a few minutes until I get vaporized
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:31:38 You got the best ships and spaceships lo
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:33:50 You have sheer quantity and quality combined and it's impressive.
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:35:52 Yeah I was just impressed by the F-22, the F-18 and F-14 look kind of average or below average.
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:38:13 impressive
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:40:20 Now I'm embarrassed to only be making this
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:42:27 ty, but its really obviously not much in comparison to those ships and planes. Also <@!447139512707973120> it's a Mitsubishi F-2.

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:23:08 until I kinda fell off
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:23:20 I made an absolutely shit f-22, and then took a break
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:23:32 then my parents split
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:23:36 and I adopted a dog
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:23:43 and from that, I started bitcoin

creations-chat 2021-11-20 10:33:25 Wings are understandable but the nose is slanted, its just not too slanted because it obstructs my intake.
creations-chat 2021-11-20 10:42:16 The front half wedge needs to be longer imo
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:07:08 <@!629858706997248000> What should I fix up?
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:11:25 Bruh that's literally detail, the trails on the nose are found on the actual aircraft, as well as the wing trails and grey lines, same with the elevator and grey on the fuselage. The red in front of the stabiliser is intentional and used as detail for my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:14:49 You can see there are grey lines on the fuselage and I extended the grey outline easily seen at the back and on the middle segment, the grey shape on the top of the fuselage can also be seen. Sorry my exhaust looks a bit blocky, I can't really fix that,
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:17:02 sad because your opinion is quite off because the looks of a plane is factual lol. Would you like me to give some feedback on your builds?
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:19:11 I'll accept any realistic feedback that shows my plane as inaccurate and I don't really care that much but like why does your opinion influence the accuracy of my plane?

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:57:23 It's just a prototype
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:03:54 "Thrust vectoring, also known as thrust vector control (TVC), is the ability of an aircraft, rocket, or other vehicle to manipulate the direction of the thrust from its engine(s)" <@!746383586755870821>  It does just that, but in a very irregular and stupid way lol.
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:04:03 Supposed to be some sort of futuristic prototype
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:04:12 Almost certain it wouldn't work irl
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:04:13 but
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:04:14 who knows
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:05:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:05:22 dumb idea
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:05:28 i should probably just make something realistic
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:07:13 Unless
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:07:25 I have a negative motor rotation to the vectoring
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:07:34 so the wing remains on the 180 degree angle
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:07:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:08:45 the wings are locked in and there is no way I can make it realistic
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:08:52 maybe it exists in some sort of alternate realist
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:08:55 reality*
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:08:57 Anyway
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:09:08 it works alright i guess
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:09:26 I'll probably save it as a prototype for proper thrust vectoring

creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:06:41 bad stabilisers*, exposed motorlock, canopy looks off too, flaps look kinda ugly too
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:20:39 I see 2 angled top and bottom wedge pieces with a triangle wedge at the end to form the point
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:20:47 way easier than the su-57 nose imo

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:25:11 well the plane looks good
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:25:21 canopy might be a touch to small but that might just be angle
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:25:44 you gonna use it for the photo?

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:29:33 I think they should be a bit closer and the black should be 1.5 long
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:29:51 but idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:29:58 ah
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:30:10 I think that they just look too thick
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:30:14 that might be the issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 11:30:39 trim down the sides and have it widen towards the engine to sit flush

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 12:06:37 it front flips at a insane speed, maybe 0.1 seconds to rotate 360
creations-chat 2021-12-02 10:58:25 Your build's cockpit slopes way too much at the rear, and the body and cockpit is generally too thin and long

creations-chat 2021-12-12 04:50:34 Canard development
creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:37:57 looking at images on google, Adding trails, wing panels, piston locked decals etc. I borrow a lot of features from different images. I'll give an example after cooldown
creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:41:25 Here, as you can see there are 2 small fins on the front slope of the rudder, and on the downward slope of the cockpit's connection to the spine. There is also a small red detail, being a light on the left side of the intake. As well as this, there is a small black strip protruding from the front of the wing. Other decals are easily noticeable and I just spam them in. Spam = good
creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:45:17 dms
creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:54:48 Thanks man
creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:59:22 Fair, I tried to go all out on the details department so it's fair if it looks a bit sus
creations-chat 2021-12-12 06:23:25 Elongated and slanted intakes, as well as canards, does it look alright?
creations-chat 2021-12-13 06:30:41 This look alright for an a10 nose?

Yes its very true, many other issues like the nose and paint, and there is no thrust vectoring
creations-chat 2021-12-13 12:18:18 True, it’s almost 3 months old now and it’s basically my 2nd motorlocked build.

It was also made horribly at the start and it caused many many issues when I worked on improving it due to the underlying problems that I couldn’t fix. My bad for the crappy build 🙁
creations-chat 2021-12-16 03:24:58 sparkler is finally here im so excited
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:28:58 sparkler 😌

creations-chat 2021-12-16 04:16:43 a10 nose alright?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 04:32:46 But this looks better, right?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:33:27 Good a10 nose?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 04:39:25 Any better? canopy fix later
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:06:33 make it thinner, remove the bottom half block
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:10:24 Don't think an f105 is possible at that scale, you'd have to motorlock a custom angle for the slope
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:13:52 I mean for the slope of the nose making it longer
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:41:21 Why does this spine always look so off
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:44:12 Any better
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:57:23 How do I fix this A10 spine?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:05:44 I'm done, this is getting way too messy
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:12:53 How do I continue from here? When I add a spine it often looks too tall.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:30:41 Ah I already left, I'll work on it later.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:34:55 I angled it custom and it looked a bit like this
https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/920914191269904384
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:38:48 Yes that was my issue, trying to get the spine to sit below the spine without it looking comical when I blend the noticeable gap between the end of the canopy and the spine
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:43:33 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/920917508716900382

Like this blend, I'm trying to get the canopy to slope down further but It's not working too well with the space I have. Alright, thanks, I'll try to work on it with the advice you've given.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 08:09:02 its funny when people go to so much detail explaining the build and its stats and 6 images just for it to look absolutely horrible lmfao
creations-chat 2021-12-19 08:26:42 looks sick my guy
creations-chat 2021-12-19 08:58:53 is that just a control room or what build are you going for?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:01:40 So like a whole building?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:04:49 I see, well if you can make everything at that level it would be seriously impressive, looking forward to seeing how it turns out. I feel like the way you've made it, it gives a really really fitting atmosphere and theme, dayum.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:12:46 engines look not that great rest looks good
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:17:08 standards need to 👆
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:19:38 move back a block or 2
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:23:03 A block back would look better
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:26:34 And if you could, maybe wing panels to give the elevators that angle rising towards the engines if you know what I mean. all up to you tho
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:29:07 nose kinda fat, intakes small, engines too far back, the elevators look a bit bad, so do the fuel things and cockpit
creations-chat 2021-12-19 09:54:41 You're so hilarious when you act like an 8 year old for comedic purposes!!! honestly stfu you probably have bad breath

creations-chat 2021-12-19 14:31:50 agree apart from 1st and 4th reason, well, mostly

1 block wide looks good for some planes but yes it is very hard to get proportionate
creations-chat 2021-12-19 14:33:57 definitely. also that's a weird looking tree <@!719168864705052802>
creations-chat 2021-12-19 14:36:15 1 wide looks alright with f-15s and older planes cold war era

creations-chat 2021-12-20 11:21:18 Canopy opens, not sure if I should keep this cause it needs a bunch of space inside the build and cockpit to work.

creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:30:17 if I made the intakes higher up it would look worse, and if I made them any shorter they would be comically bad

oh wait I realise the mistake I made, I added blocks underneath experimentally 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:33:44 to make my build look decent, I would have to move the engines up 0.5 blocks but that also looked bad

creations-chat 2022-01-03 07:53:29 the fear of abandonment and the fear found in many liminal spaces derives from the feel of a completely habitable and regular, while perhaps vintage or old place having absolutely nothing at all (like humans and stuff). thats why the backrooms and shit like that is so scary

creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:13:52 i dont have speakers 😭
creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:28:57 robloxian powered vehicle
creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:48:37 idk but are the engines small or is it just the angle or
creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:53:41 maybe the shadows just make them look small, I'd go for 2 blocks wide for the engines so 1 block wrapped with halfblocks

ok they're probably right then. yes colour and shadows

plane-crazy 2022-01-08 12:00:14 you reckon a tank like 33% bigger than an abrams would be realistic?
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 12:00:38 maybe like 43%

creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:36:46 Even if i didn't hate anime the build isn't that good
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:40:10 Yes I hate it because it's meh and anime, double whammy.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:45:44 Neither should I from an anime enjoyer 👍

creations-chat 2022-01-12 15:43:30 i spend 2 days on a build or I'll leave it
creations-chat 2022-01-12 15:51:12 same,
creations-chat 2022-01-12 15:55:54 I hoped it would, I was going for something inspired by the k2 and leopard variants

<@456226577798135808> cheers mate
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:03:56 <@!473580489337339914> yo, what should I fix up on my build? 🛠️
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:06:25 understandable, but it is kinda hard to make 1 block wide tracks, have them work, and still have it look pleasing and not ruin features I want to add in the rest of the build.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:08:33 Possible and possible without ruining the build, creating disproportions and issues is very distant.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:10 Plus, I'm trying not to overcomplicate my builds, my builds usually only consist 1 motor tower and I'd like to keep it that simple and easy to modify and work with.

Also the barrel hole is quite hard as when I remove the bases of the sparklers, it removes the decal on the front automatically, and there is no way to add a text block onto the front of the sparkler? 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:16:01 I thought you meant the hole in the front of the barrel 🤷‍♂️ 

I don't have easily accessible space to create another completely identical turret system, especially with a locked motor bringing the sparklers in, it would make my turret look pretty much hideous at the base.


I have one block inside the turret that I use for the elevation motor, how tf do I fit another motor in 1 block of space without glitching it out?
ok good talk
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:19:42 I meant I have a single motor, in a single block of open space that means it doesn't glitch out, right?
This motor moves the gun up and down.
I can't fit another motor in the 1 block of open space that my elevation motor sits in?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:25:45 so what else i fix
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:32:11 yes sides kinda bad, idk about colours i thought they were kinda spicy u know, what colours should I go for?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:34:30 Yeah less saturated agree, I tried to make it dark enough for a forest, but it's kinda neither light or dark enough for anything, will fix perhaps
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:41:44 <@!719168864705052802> feedback would be appreciated i guess
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:44:46 yes I used the same green in different shades maybe next time I'll do a camo of some sort, not sure about the barrel, it seemed alright but I might improve it and add back some features
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:59:41 what should I do with this?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 17:02:30 
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 17:03:32 somebody pick a style of 5th or 6th gen intakes

creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:56:23 Slowmode kinda useful, it would be way more messy if people didn't think for 2 minutes before saying what they want to say.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:58:32 Sometimes you can't fix stupid people, but it's better if they don't spam anyway. If there was no slowmode this channel would go absolutely ballistic during an argument.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:02:10 True, glory to the whitenames
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:04:31 Just have people ask if they want honest, sometimes harsh, and constructive feedback, or kind feedback about what is good about their build?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:06:32 150 upvotes on a good looking build for des expert
Not a meme build
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:08:34 Insecure
Just treat people the same and you won't look like an asshole lol. Keep some things to yourself too.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:10:58 Im not a furry, but I can still learn to leave them to do whatever they want, it doesn't affect me. Sure, cringe is real but you gotta keep some stuff to yourself
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:13:04 A furry makes a good build
A transgender makes a good build
A person of different complexion makes a good build.
They should all be treated the same
If you can't do that, fuck you.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:15:50 In another server lmfao, and you treat them worse than straight people who do the same???
If they don't affect you personally, then don't hate on them for no reason. That's just childish
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:19:10 For sure.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:21:19 Straight people that arent furries dox too 🤦
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:24:52 Yeah imagine if somebody of different ethnicity tripped you over, so you punched somebody else from that same ethnicity.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:27:32 If you hate on somebody or a group because they have a connection in hobbies to a person who treated you wrong. Get a life lol
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:31:14 Youre treating this like only furries doxx, plus they were a different person. Just treat people the same and if they do something to you, its not always associated with them being a furry. You need to chill man.

creations-chat 2022-01-13 06:31:24 currently how it looks
creations-chat 2022-01-13 07:02:11 how many engines should it have? 1 or 2?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 07:04:24 what engine style?
F-22, etc
creations-chat 2022-01-13 07:07:27 ill make a single engine
creations-chat 2022-01-13 07:10:19 Should the body be longer?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 07:19:31 This good?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 08:21:14 why do my motors keep spinning after i rotate them?

I move them, and they kinda keep gliding and it messes it up all the time
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:13:25 im making a custom successor to the f-22 and f-35, what rudder style should it have?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:21:47 custom f-22 and 35 successor, how does it look so far?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:24:04 is it bad?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:26:30 fixed the vertical stabiliser
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:36:11 It's already pretty fat. Keep in mind it is designed to be a mass produced f-35 successor, and isn't supposed to be as advanced as an f-22, though close. Hence why it has 1 engine and is a lot smaller than the f-22
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:38:52 it's a f-35 successor, kinda a combination of both f22 and 35
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:48:22 better spine
creations-chat 2022-01-13 11:26:15 Custom, supposed to be like that
creations-chat 2022-01-13 11:30:58 hmm, I mean, maybe that isn't a bad thing, well, to me it isn't lol

does it make it look a bit sus?

Positive feedback:

creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:41:53 If it’s that troublesome to redo the turret, I would personally restart.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:44:23 It looks like a Soviet destroyer or some sort of artillery idk.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:48:00 Make the nose more defined i guess.

creations-chat 2022-01-13 17:11:31 Noted, this was somewhat an experimental build, and I’m learning to build it this size and style, I will definitely put this towards my next jet.

creations-chat 2022-01-14 08:59:06 Anything really, super jets usually
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:12:19 1 Block wide working tracks are hard enough to do and fit into a build, it is close to impossible to make them look good and function.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:16:43 2 block wide works but tbh it isn't that appealing to look at, also needs quite a large tank to work in and look proportionate in, you usually see them in bigger tanks.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:54:06 good build but it seems a bit stubby and the engines seem a bit small
creations-chat 2022-01-14 10:00:05 i wasnt here when vulpen posted that but his is also a bit disproportionate.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 10:23:14 Positive feedback:
|| build is smooth, good colours ||

Honest Feedback:

|| Pretty good build, but the proportions of the canopy and other features make it look a bit stubby, engines seem small but that might just be camera angle ||

What you do with the build is up to you

creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:28:49 Does the "grass" on the barrel look bad?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:32:14 inspo, but I don't want to hide too much of the tank itself
creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:54:28 does this look bad?

Which is better?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:56:43 angle better
creations-chat 2022-01-14 14:00:29 tank is fairly tall, also changing the grass now
creations-chat 2022-01-14 14:05:41 Better grass?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 14:48:43 Redone side print and barrel details
creations-chat 2022-01-14 14:55:42 <@!698587744842022983> what should I improve about my build?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:06:37 that's fine, study hard 📝

Which looks better?
I made it less saturated and darker.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:36:31 It's a custom design, also front pic:
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:40:14 How should I improve?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:45:48 All angles, what's up with it? It's only around 2 full motorlock towers entirely.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:51:40 perfect
It's supposed to be for the army, so you can expect some prankster to decorate it.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:54:17 ill fix it up
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:58:20 Better <@!765983880032682054> ?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:02:29 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:05:52 if you mean the main gun yes, the 50 cal thing no
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:08:07 cameras, a lot of cameras
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:10:54 This is build mode, also press 1 to go to your normal view instead of going through 300 cameras

I start by making the base of the turret with normal blocks and angling, then I move onto detailing and try to paint last (unless you suck at camo like me)
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:30:06 fixed the colour variation issues (mostly) and ill tackle the rest, I dont want to make it too beat up because it is a very modern tank
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:55:28 fair but the space around my tracks is kinda limited so 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:04:20 I meant space to add stuff to the wheels and tracks, I can paint for sure
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:07:00 I can't fit text signs on the majority of the wheels, its very tightly packed
I may be able to do some motorlocking magic on a seperate tower though
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:09:24 Yep.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:37:19 <@719168864705052802> Wow you downvoted my build mass downvoter 😡😡😡😡
Admins, seize him!
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:39:57 Imagine if there wasn't a massive build in HOF
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:41:59 Looks bad compared to the real one
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:44:37 How to get into HOF
Make a very large build.
I wish smaller builds were easier to get into hof
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:47:26 The hornet looks good for a build but not exceptional
Remove the T72 as well. Although it is old it is below average IMO
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:50:07 I don't like how the t72 looks in general. Tiny blocky turret with a long ass gun on a flat hull.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:52:08 Its accurate and put together but its not awesome. I think mko has better builds that are more sensible for hof
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:54:30 Imagine F2 in creations (joke)
Ive posted it too many times

What about in HoF tho?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:58:18 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/911496231589650472
Does this seem good enough for a new standards hof build?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:00:49 I hate making big builds, but should I try to add more to that build or? I want it to have a chance because I don't have the motive to create another somewhat good build. But if I add more it will probably look bad and unrealistic.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:03:06 Why tf am I hungry asf, can somebody find that pic of the hornet created in entirely motorlock.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:06:54 Most of my builds only have 1-2 towers. Motorlocking is bad ew

I don't want to be like that, but I had like 20 angle locks and 25 piston locks on my plane 👨‍❤️‍👨
creations-chat 2022-01-15 10:16:23 su-34s are rare, it would be epic to see one done well, try fixing the cheese graters plsplsplsplspls
creations-chat 2022-01-15 10:33:10 Wait are you the same person as <@!744591826891046943>  or am I stupedd?
creations-chat 2022-01-15 10:35:12 I'm double stupid, I thought weep's name was AWACS Sweepin this whole time. Pretend I didn't say anything.
creations-chat 2022-01-15 10:38:32 shut up bro I got wayy more chromosomes than you 😎
creations-chat 2022-01-15 10:42:00 I have the chromosome DLC and expansion pack.
creations-chat 2022-01-15 11:51:36 Which is better?
creations-chat 2022-01-15 11:56:57 I don't like 2 tbh, there is a massive gap above the wheels and it looks bad.
Also 1 seems more realistic?
Thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:21:34 Is it alright to delete a creation with lots of reactions because you do not like the way it looks, and it has already been posted before with minimal differences, not to mention I want to post the build again with many new changes later?
I feel like I've reposted it and it looks ugly.
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:24:07 I don't want to be that gronk that posts 20 pictures of my build.

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 12:35:20 But you do you
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 12:35:47 It should be pretty symmetrical though
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 12:38:01 if an f-4 phantom ever gets into HOF I'm going to do something I will very much regret
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:43:21 I can't, I'm physically unable to have elevation if I try. My motor is under the red circle and there is no space to have a motor locking blocks half back. Also whenever I try to have phased blocks in my gun it spazzes out.

forgot to post photo

general 2022-01-15 13:20:56 I've had some 270s for 3 years and even with a hole they took 2 months to deflate enough for me to get rid of them
general 2022-01-15 13:22:25 If you don't want to get the heat, that's not my problem.
If you wanna dress well, there is a point to getting it. Most people will judge you on what you're wearing and that's just something you can't change, so why not spend a bit more cash for the comfortable heat 🔥
general 2022-01-15 13:23:32 You be tiptoeing around in these, you getting judged
general 2022-01-15 13:23:45 can't change the fact that people will judge the way you dress
general 2022-01-15 13:24:54 You could probably find some 270s for less than 80 euros

the rest will be fixed
You reckon the barrel would look worse with gaps than it would with sparkler bases?
removing the fard trails
creations-chat 2022-01-16 11:30:18 I've tried a ton to fix the mantlet, should I instead have a barrel that is unable to elevate or "depress"? ( i don't know terminology)
I don't think it's possible to have a good looking manlet or barrel at this scale with the conditions I have.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 11:36:31 Ok, I got it.
Reply with 1 if I should have a moving gun (up and down) with gaps, an ugly mantlet, and ugly turret in general.
Reply with 2 if I should have a non-moving gun with no gaps, an appealing gun and mantlet.

creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:01:31 Not if you don't want gaps in the barrel and a bad mantlet and detailing.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:05:08 ok bro, there aren't that many decals hiding the tank, I think you need glasses.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:11:39 Well you'd really think a motorlocked tank designed to look good should pvp?
you should also consider the many complaints about lack of detail and looks, even gaps when I had a working turret.
And yes, in this case I am prioritising it.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:14:57 Well that opinion serves as somewhat useless when it comes to making a good looking build to post in PCC. 

Also <@!441939688018935818> is right, what is a moving turret that doesn't affect pvp capability going to do for me?
The turret spins, and I've maintained a level of visual appeal in the build and that is enough.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:17:12 I could easily revert to a functional gun that moves up and down, but it looks bad and I don't want to.
Not only is it difficult to have it at this scale, there are many other circumstances that limit my build if I have a working barrel.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 17:21:22 Not really? It doesn't seem cluttered or overdetailed? To be fair it looks a lot cleaner than some of your builds?

creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:01:11 what is the somewhat ok build in this case?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:04:16 I experience that a lot, especially when I post a few worse angles compared to a few good angles, sometimes the worse ones do better no matter just because of spikes.
Also gotta account for the pissyshit downvoter.

This was my first boat, and it was made before I had sparklers, I've upgraded it slightly since I posted it, but I'm too lazy to record a video and apply for expert shipwright.

will send updated pics
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:09:16 
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:11:43 I added a bunch of tiny details and filled the entire hull to get 4000 blocks and I'm still too lazy to apply
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:57:26 if its big it will get into hof, if it is small it has no chance, or so I've learnt
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:12:34 It has a lot to do with size, the bigger it is the more "impressive" it is. Plus the 1 smaller jet in HOF is agreed shouldn't be in there anyway. If you make a tiny creation with a bunch of detail, it is a lot harder to get into HOF than an enormous arctic explorer.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:17:51 the past 7 HOF builds are all plot sized or larger, now are there any 1 block wide jets in there? Hars' jet is quite large to be honest, and the f-18 is pretty random to see in HOF because it isn't the best 2 block wide jet in creations, not even from MKO.

general 2022-01-18 09:48:47 
creations-chat 2022-01-18 09:52:46 Add more detail, change the colours to not be completely grey, change the horrible material choice, the windows are too bright blue. 
Rn the build looks horribly plain and basic, but it could turn out pretty good if you work on it more.

general 2022-01-22 10:47:33 Indeed
general 2022-01-22 10:48:24 Well, perhaps a HOF build deserves Master Designer?
general 2022-01-22 10:48:48 Hi
general 2022-01-22 10:48:56 trying to make a bigger build for HOF eligibility
general 2022-01-22 10:49:31 Perhaps.
general 2022-01-22 10:49:33 I was thinking
general 2022-01-22 10:49:38 Rhino from GTAV
general 2022-01-22 10:50:16 Because I can't think of anything else.
general 2022-01-22 10:50:50 Night has pulled that off pretty well, I'm not into the shaping of it.
general 2022-01-22 10:51:10 Might do something that has been somewhat less popular.

general 2022-01-22 10:54:44 this thing
general 2022-01-22 10:54:46 the 2a7 140
general 2022-01-22 10:54:49 it might be from a game
general 2022-01-22 10:54:54 but I think it looks pretty rad
general 2022-01-22 10:55:23 I don't really want to do the leopard for 2 reasons
general 2022-01-22 10:55:43 The front of the  hull looks kinda bland and there isn't really much realistic detail you can put on there
general 2022-01-22 10:55:54 and I don't feel motivated enough
general 2022-01-22 10:56:25 ripp
general 2022-01-22 10:57:02 I feel like my tank has way more potential
general 2022-01-22 10:57:12 But its tough trying to figure out what to add
general 2022-01-22 10:57:22 so I'm just adding environments and diorama type things
general 2022-01-22 10:58:38 Anybody got any good tree designs that I could borrow?
general 2022-01-22 10:58:47 Preferably without leaves.
general 2022-01-22 10:58:58 I'm making an environment and my trees look horrible.
general 2022-01-22 10:59:33 I don't exactly live in chernobyl or ukraine.
general 2022-01-22 11:00:01 I could try, but I don't have the space to create entire buildings large enough to fit my scale.
general 2022-01-22 11:00:07 Pretty much.
general 2022-01-22 11:00:45 Night suggested having completely broken trees stripped of leaves.
general 2022-01-22 11:00:54 Not sure how well I may be able to pull it off.
general 2022-01-22 11:01:04 Since my trees need to be much smaller than the ones he created.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:06:14 Both builds are impressive.

creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:39:41 any better?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:42:36 working on it
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:47:32 good job
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:52:38 This look like a decent broken tree to you?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:27:48 does it look better?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:34:50 Perhaps different angles?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:37:40 I'm removing some of the random clutter, perhaps that would make it look a bit better
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:40:17 With clutter reduction

creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:02:41 would've done better without the reference anyway
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:23:22 I want the big trees though

Chernobyl MUTANT TREES!
theyre alive!!!1!!1
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:25:49 I made them that size because if they are made smaller, it's hard to make them look good whatsoever.
Also, does this shot look alright?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:38:01 It's alright, just hit me up when you're able to and we can work on some good looking trees together.

<@!410455661814480896> <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:43:32 Yep, comes with turret rotation too.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:45:53 Well, my piston helping the rotation struggles, but if you retry the piston pushing multiple times while the torque is maxed, it might work.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:32:36 new trees?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:47:30 Do the smaller trees improve it?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:52:47 noted, although, it is pretty intentional
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:56:46 It's possible, but I think it wouldn't look very full.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:04:50 my guy, you're wasting your time, go write about it in suggestions for the minimal chance that they'll add something like that. This is a building game not an FPS game. Go play call of duty or smth

creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:25:56 <@!347182144873037824> That's a sick tank, are you able to use working tracks on it?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:37:34 the sneaky top view
not sure if the tank sticks out enough
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:45:32 trees are supposed to be pretty big
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:48:57 If I made them smaller it would look alright but when I work with half blocks things tend to be blocky without triangle wedges.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:53:55 My build isn’t motor locked and I do not plan for it to be.

How tf did this get upvotes entirely.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:12:41 Thoughts so far? Obviously nowhere near completion
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:14:43 Elevators aren't as steeply angled as they should be, there isn't enough gap between the wings and elevators, engine placement seems to be off, and the spine could be longer. I would also lock a 1x4 wing panel into the front of the wings to give the slight curve that it needs.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:16:49 Sounds good, keep working and it'll turn out great.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:24:08 Looks basic, generic, and has little to no detail
Seems relatively blocky and some colours are gross.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:28:18 The pastel blue makes it look a bit off.
On the jet engines, that is.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:30:48 Do you think this desert/bush colour scheme looks alright?

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:19:19 
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:20:02 I think you'd want it to overlap, so that there aren't any obvious gaps when the wing sweeps.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:22:39 I mean the entire part that doesn't move is placed above the moving wing part, so that it can hide any gaps. The wings shouldn't look paper thin anyway.
bot-central 2022-01-23 09:22:44 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:24:03 Yeah, when you look at it from a front angle, the wings are kinda thick at the fuselage.

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:24:34 what i was saying
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:24:35 earlier
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:25:02 Piston lock exists
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:25:34 I know that Dailysean has made a really good wing sweep mechanism that sits flush with the non moving part overlapping and hiding any gaps when the wing folds.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:25:44 I'm not a big sweep expert so maybe check with him.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:26:35 ?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:27:24 wha
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:28:59 You can have the sweep motor hidden in the fuselage and connected to the wings with invisible texts, but you have to piston lock it down slightly so the wings go down and are able to be slightly below the non moving part.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:29:12 You just need to get the right angle for it to look alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 09:29:15 or

Currently I have a Ukrainian Warzone (Forest) diorama and an Afghanistan War (Desert) diorama.
What's next?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:35:49 That seems a bit similar to the Afghanistan Diorama?

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:37:17 Currently I have a Desert, and Jungle diorama.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:38:03 Would be cool but I have a similar forest theme and my tank is a modern MBT, and I'm not sure if it would really belong there.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:38:18 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:38:24 ill think of something
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:44:52 Perhaps I will go for an arctic camo.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:47:53 upwards lock is good, side lock is good, but using both is better.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:48:07 Just be sure to hide the motors well and it should be really good
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:48:30 Personally, upwards lock seems to be easier and superior for smaller builds.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:48:39 What are you making?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:52:56 This look aight for an arctic themed camo.

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 14:05:55 anchor lolol
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:13:50 if you have a block of empty space in your build, you can fit a motor and connect it to a panel that sits flush with your fuselage using text blocks.
I think that's what you're currently doing, so you might just be able to make it longer?
If you can't you may need to shorten the engine things.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:16:39 Ignore everything I said, apart from shorten the engine things whatever they may be called.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:19:31 Maybe try using a half ball to make the connection to the fuselage?

<@!719168864705052802> what should I improve about the tank entirely?
Perhaps some difference in general detail across the tanks?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:51:02 I could make it wider, but that just changes the scale of the build entirely, and I’d much rather have it be a tall tank, adds more to it imo.

If you can see anything really off about the hull, just ping me about it and I’ll work on fixing it tomorrow.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:22:11 What are your thoughts on this scene?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:24:28 I'll add more detail, but I'm not sure if it would ruin the general aesthetic of emptiness and lifelessness.

What type of detail would look good?

creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:15:43 However it looks nothing like how it does in real life.
Or what was shown in the reference image, anyway.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:30:02 Engines are too bright, the build lacks detail and is rather generic and common.
The nose is much too sharp.
Also add custom engines if you want it to look better.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:32:05 Because with no curvature inwards it looks quite comical, and duck-like. Also fix the rudders and engines.

creations-chat 2022-01-26 15:06:44 Are the front things control panels? If so do yo need to keep them pressed or something?
creations-chat 2022-01-26 15:13:12 that would be so useful I wish I had known.

creations-chat 2022-01-27 06:31:17 <@!747811503591129170> what i fix?
creations-chat 2022-01-27 06:57:46 fair, I'm doing another one that should be a bit different
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:44:48 I mean, although it is harder, master supremes and whatnots have more experience in building, most of the time. Wouldn’t this make them more eligible for determining if the builds are worth?

Contest winners need to make a good build that gets a lot of upvotes. This can be a meme build or anything. However most master ranks require HOF submission and high block counts, as well as Staff approval.
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:52:59 Yeah expert supreme may not deserve it, but master ranked players should *in my opinion* I suck at understanding sarcasm so excuse me for doing something stupid lol.
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:58:26 Going to try to come up with something next contest if the topic isn’t lame.

mediocre build with cheese grater wings and a bad use of editing and photo angles.
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:42:07 Not plane crazy, its just a lack of skill
creations-chat 2022-01-31 07:47:50 you should make the super hornet, the intakes are generally easier because with smoke things it looks a tad small

creations-chat 2022-01-31 10:38:56 No that angle is definitely steeper than 1x1 delta wings but not as steep as 1x2s 💀
creations-chat 2022-02-02 10:13:38 The locking on the wings looks kinda bad, same with the curvature at the front of the wing whatever it may be called.

creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:05:10 cool but the tanks are kinda ugly
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:07:17 not really the camo, most tanks at that scale just look ugly, it's not easy to fix
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:10:11 i mean it can sometimes be pulled off kinda well but most tanks smaller than roscale look shit
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:15:52 most ww2 tanks are a lot easier to do in roscale, but like
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:18:20 make your next sukhoi 6 wide nose
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:21:21 not making a roscale build or mini builds and making a differently sized build is like taking a good piss

creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:15:24 noooo!!!! :dies:
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:20:52 decided to make it custom because I couldn't do the nose effectively :dies:
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:37:29 too angular and the ladders look bad, colours also look a bit sus
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:44:14 perhaps <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

<@!723940197456281640> I made the nose longer only for you papi 🥺
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:47:33 The intakes aren't angled too much inwards on this one?
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:50:23 
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:54:49 Wait what part do you mean?
creations-chat 2022-02-04 09:58:49 would be cool
creations-chat 2022-02-04 10:02:44 Seyo and I think aviationwxxb are also doing this

creations-chat 2022-02-04 14:44:40 Ty lol 😃
creations-chat 2022-02-04 14:50:46 Build itself lacks detail, the paint job isn’t very good, and it’s well, too simple.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 00:32:36 You should make large builds <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Your T-72 is pretty epic


<@!765318482753224704> nothing is even going on, you got me laughing so hard 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:10:34 Exposed motor lock needs fixing.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:14:36 Wait what is the build? Also I was joking about it being in build mode.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:19:21 Looks good
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:43:24 Tutorials shouldn’t have motor lock. Not only does it allow undes to flex a somewhat decent build but people will click off if the build is too difficult for them or too long.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:45:34 What

Unde sees large motor lock build on thumbnail
Not a modern fighter jet or b22
Unde does not click 
You are sad
No subs or views.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:48:11 What 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:50:39 Just post a shitty f22 click bait tutorial and it’s a win win.

Undes flex bad builds that people realise are trash
You get views and whatever.

No point to making a motor locked ww2 bomber because they won’t click and the ones that do have something good to flex.

creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:01:18 the blood of orphans
creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:26:44 because it uses basic motorlocking
creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:52:52 also give the intake depth because rn it looks kinda sus ^
creations-chat 2022-02-05 09:04:29 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/939396719609794640/RobloxScreenShot20220205_121741758.png

something about it is so sus
creations-chat 2022-02-05 09:19:49 i would make the intake deeper


send me more angles
creations-chat 2022-02-05 09:32:32 spoiler done
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:52:49 <@!747811503591129170> The kfir looks good but the intakes are kinda small and they look a bit squished, and maybe you could make the nose longer?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:55:42 I think 2 should do for the nose, the rest seems good
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:59:05 Yeah the nose is always really long and pointy on mirages.
take your time there is no rush
help 2022-02-05 11:25:18 you get those error codes if you have exploits or intentional malware and shit on your device.
So you copied a build and got banned for hacking?

creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:15:51 <@!719168864705052802> Yo I tried to fix the things you mentioned, let me know if it looks better.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:20:04 This is with the cockpit extension
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:24:02 Glass canopy
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:29:03 Personally I don't think the glass canopy looks that bad, you can barely see the cylinders for the frams and there is a lot of space for detail
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:35:16 give feedback on extended glass canopy and fixes
😄 

sorry for so many images trying to get as much done before I head off.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 13:31:03 haha
help 2022-02-05 13:46:00 no but you exploited
help 2022-02-05 13:46:09 now you're banned from roblox on any account, basically.
help 2022-02-05 13:46:28 that error code is always for if you have exploits on your device
help 2022-02-05 13:46:43 That's if it keeps happening whenever you try to join.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:54:17 Ty a lot for taking your time to help me out. I'll be sure to work on the things you mentioned and get back to you in the morning. 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:57:09 Thanks to all the positive feedback from others as well. Last question is, should I have half block thick wings or regular? I suppose regular would be more manageable and customiseable.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 03:11:46 Are you still making the mirage? Also the nose is kinda smoothn’t.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 03:38:24 k
creations-chat 2022-02-06 04:29:04 Elevators complete with leading and whatever edges.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 04:34:58 I used 2 shades, there is a certain range of colours that mimic metallic effect, they're like pastel but darker if yk what I mean.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 06:44:01 When you have a 2000 block build that has excessive motorlocking in the fuselage and weight imbalances, AND it is created only to be used for looks, there is no real need for everything to function. To make it function is basically making it look ugly.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 06:51:06 I'm not going to use it for pvp?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:01:32 Its 2 seperately angle locked parts, and the both go into the fuselage to make it look flush, how do you expect me to have function anyway.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:03:54 Also, completed the wings.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:06:35 I kinda like it this size tho?
not sure about it
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:09:04 Supposed to be a successor to the f1/2 being an "F-3"

Wings are supposed to be smaller and different to the f1
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:13:52 Also my wings help simulate the intakes initially going back into the main body.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 08:57:00 dw adding more later
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:47:27 although the intakes do slope in a continuous angle after a few blocks, I will add more detail. not sure how I would be able to improve the exhaust nozzle as it seems decent enough.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:57:06 I gotchu, with the bumps, it's just to try to stop gaps and stuff, but I'll work on fixing it now.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:17:41 poopy account
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:20:10 Heres a few views and a new engine
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:27:51 im not removing that <@!719168864705052802> 

also do I add armament?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:36:48 Not entirely sure.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:43:06 Wing undersides, I'll work on hardpoints and armament tomorrow.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:14:34 Making the statement that every expert is so horrible, evil, and rude makes me want to downvote your builds 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:23:26 I’d be happy upvoting any good build made by you, but when you start banging along with the stereotype telling people that ALL experts are so evil!! It’s just stupid. Now I will have no remorse when I tell you to cope and build better, and stop crying, using the bland stereotype whenever somebody critiques your build.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:26:22 That’s sick, but is there any way to replace the guns used for the barrel?
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:11:08 Armament done
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:13:46 I'm doing a photoshoot with him, the inspired plane is similar anyway. There are also a huge number of differences between builds.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:15:53 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/940111269460049950/Screen_Shot_2022-02-06_at_4.52.03_PM.png

Many differences
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:35:42 Top one isn't mine lol, thats seyos.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:44:02 Ah ty, but seyos jet is what inspired me and his is very good. Personally I think both are good in different ways.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:56:54 Not sure, but I'm trying to make the build mode as concise as possible
creations-chat 2022-02-07 13:03:58 Canopy front is too steep, the intake is too far back.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 21:21:47 Canopy is too thin and some parts of the fuselage are smoothn’t. If you could fix that it would be good. Armament below the plane looks a bit out of place without anything on the wings, hard points could also look pretty nice.
creations-chat 2022-02-08 09:24:08 smoothn't
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 09:33:53 .
creations-chat 2022-02-08 09:59:49 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-02-08 10:02:19 there are though
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:19:50 It is ||you wish||
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:21:24 but it isn't very good
and a good barrel would finish the build making it exceptional
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:54:26 the sides of your turret should curve inwards
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:55:06 why
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:56:07 personally I'm not worried about wasting space in a tank that's basically finished
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:56:24 you should fix it if you can
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:01 why, you want to make it?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:09 you shouldn't
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:11 roscale is bad
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:15 ww2 tanks are worse
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:19 :dies:
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:57:52 build a custom mbt or something
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:08 better than making a roscale ww2 tank and joining that community of people
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:13 shush
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:16 🤬
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:30 even if I can't make it
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:37 ww2 is overrated
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:58:40 best war is the emu war
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 10:59:56 I know too many people that talk about ww2 too much
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:00:01 at this point I hate hearing it
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:00:11 And people make too many ww2 builds
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:00:32 ill start another if people do not stop making jokes thinking russia is funny
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:00:38 lol xd
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:01:22 i hate the kids that think they're german and making german jokes and speaking german makes them funny
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:01:27 always the kids with greasy hair
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:01:49 greasy hair and either morbidly overweight or malnourished
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:01:54 god damn
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:02:19 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:02:46 if you were born before the war had started, and you had lived in that country for your whole life
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:02:56 There is a good chance that you believe what the people around you believe
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:03:07 and fight for what everybody thinks is "right"
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:03:27 if you were born in germany
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:03:31 before the war
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:11 but the soldiers did believe they were doing the right thing, well most of them
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:16 even if they were fed lies and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:21 or they were uneducated
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:25 you can blame them
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:28 to an extent
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:52 because if you were raised with those beliefs only there is a good chance you're going to think it's right
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:57 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:04:59 less ww2
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:05:02 more emu war
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:05:17 
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 11:08:07 what

<@!744591826891046943> yes
help 2022-02-08 11:18:14 ok
help 2022-02-08 11:18:36 thanks
help 2022-02-08 11:18:49 these little things that I miss
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:19:17 Landing gear is a huge no no and I will add an afterborner later.


<@!723940197456281640> Where to?
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:23:20 but that fuel tank is a funny one!!

perhaps under the intakes?
or just one intake for that matter
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:28:23 why move them around if I may ask
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:35:47 also i can just replace the missile thing with a gunpod
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:37:48 going to be honest, it's going to be such a goddamn pain to move them because they have 3 seperate motorlocked parts for each and I have to replace every one of them into the right spot.
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:40:40 good, because the rocket pod is the only one that doesn't have any motorlocked parts <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:42:43 Because I added some details and pylons to them and added blocks to where I cannot fit them on the main layer.

They look cool on the end anyway, plus downbending and stuff.
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:45:55 This thing got way too messy way too fast, I'm not bothered to change the location of my drop tanks
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:56:12 Yeah sorry bout that, I might feel motivated to do it some other time but for now it’s gonna stay like that. Is it a large issue from your perspective?
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:23:15 The gun, materials and general details and features can be improved
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:20:42 not only are your colours too saturated for that, but using the corroded metal doesn't look very realistic to be honest
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:47:03 nah most furries are cringe
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:54:23 I mean, somebody who likes a video games > a grown ass adult dressing up as a fluffy pink cat
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:57:28 all that for a shitty mast or whatever
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:02:08 yeah guys!!!
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:05:37 stop the argues. listen to yousapp
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:27:59 Redone armament including 2 new gun pods and moved drop tanks
also little new things
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:33:10 not sure 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:44:52 not enough space for a good looking gear set and it might make it smoothn't
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:08:06 state of the build rn
creations-chat 2022-02-12 05:56:28 engine piece still looks sus and the body of it is kinda sus

and rudders
creations-chat 2022-02-12 06:01:34 they're not really connected to the fuselage, is the problem
creations-chat 2022-02-17 09:35:41 intake looks rather small and the nose is improvable.
bot-central 2022-02-17 10:03:51 -servers
creations-chat 2022-02-18 23:14:03 Canopy protrudes a ton and the spine looks kinda bad.

Nose slope also looks uneven and choppy.

probably just make everything a ton lower

creations-chat 2022-02-19 00:59:32 porhaps

creations-chat 2022-02-21 10:49:32 should I add/keep this?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 11:41:12 What is bad about the build?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:19:04 all vehicles on 1 account, and diorama on the other since I hit the build height limit.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:21:19 Hard to please somebody who can’t meet their own standards 😩
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:26:52 Telling everybody that their builds are shit, still waiting for you to build something to the standard that you paint.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:29:18 I mean, if you claim to be so distant from pc, why are you still in this server, better yet, why are you still active and eager to express your unachievable standard?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:37:52 Just seems a tad stupid right? Somebody who doesn’t play the game, and judges based on an excessive standard in which they cannot reach takes the time to negatively criticise builds?
Seems like the only thing you get from this is attention.

creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:50:44 Exposed motorlock, ew engines, and funky looking nose. No build is ever "perfect" and rarely are builds ever close to perfect.
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:53:52 Your build is basic, knowing a trick in the game and creating a trash build just to argue about it is kinda stupid.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:21:39 looks choppy, intakes look bruh, and the cockpit and nose also look bruh
creations-chat 2022-02-28 09:01:44 looks kinda sus

creations-chat 2022-03-29 08:10:20 canopy material and frame looks sus, engines are too far apart and the light blue looks off, rudders also look sus
as well as this the rear fuselage part sloping down looks weird
nose slope isn't continuous either
creations-chat 2022-04-02 01:44:46 the rear fuselage angle looks a bit sus along with the rudder and elevators
