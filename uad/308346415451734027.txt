The Tale of xynthesis (308346415451734027)
creations-chat 2019-08-24 20:58:33 This is my first aircraft i've built so far, Capable of a partial vertical takeoff
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:03:50 Rip, they gotta be uncropped, k then one sec lol
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:06:13 Here's a better pic of it, using its "Vertical takeoff" functionality, I only say its partial vertical takeoff since its wings never pivot 90 degrees to fly straight up.
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:08:52 Nice
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:09:11 Also that plane i made has a 382 brick count, forgot to mention that rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:14:45 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:15:09 Wait what kind of suspension were they trying to copy? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:15:13 Was it like a custom suspension layout?
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:16:52 Like i have this chassis i built for one of my massive trucks, It sorta has custom suspension in the back end its a tandem suspension system
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:16:58 Sadly no friction adjustment exists though for parts rip.
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:17:07 Meaning it'll forever be a drifty mess regardless
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:17:25 I couldnt see fabric making too big of a difference though.
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:18:06 Oh rip, guess that does help a bit, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:40:04 I disable all of the outlines on my cars in studio just because how much of a mess outlines make them
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:43:34 Idk if i'd get raged at for posting a pic of one of my builds in studio or not, cause like
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:43:49 I have a build that legit turns into a giant cobweb
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:43:56 as soon as i show the welds on it
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:44:26 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:48:55 Ye that pic someone posted of the "Ps5" was gross, i sincerely hope thats not what it'll look like
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:49:30 Yeah that's why i said it wasnt really doing an actual vertical takeoff
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:49:53 Also, it lands like a normal plane still, It just lifts off the ground at an angle in a short time period instead of needing to speed up down a runway to takeoff
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:50:24 I guess i'll find out if im not allowed to "post" my own work here lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:51:04 This one build of mine from studio will literally never get welded together and scripted since it has over 1400 parts and lags like hell just to drag around in studio
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:51:37 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:51:49 Y'know whats worse
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:51:58 when windows 10 decides its gonna make you get that update one way or another
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:52:04 and forces an update right when your working on something
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:52:36 Luckily for me it only happened once, but still, windows 10 can be quite "forceful" Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:55:51 Eh, to each his own, but i still would never play fortnite personally, its not my kind of game what so ever.
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:59:18 I cant get over the amount of times i went on servers only to see people having their entire building area covered in rockets
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:59:34 and then theres just some kid spamming "lololololol" in the chat
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 21:59:52 Usually ends up with me nailing their flying blob of thrusters with my plane just sending it crashing into the ground
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:00:47 Ik what i wanna try making on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:00:52 But ik it'll like impossible to do properly
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:00:54 a rock crawler
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:01:14 I want to try to make something like my rock crawler in studio, of course it cant be a 4 link though sadly since there's no rod constraints ingame
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:01:47 Not a true 4 link though
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:02:02 I would be trying to make a triangulated 4 link
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:03:06 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:03:13 
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:04:42 My rock crawler in studio is actually a mechanical 4 link pushrod rock crawler = a bit too much going on in it
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:04:43 XD
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:06:08 But like yeah if i was to attempt to make a triangulated 4 link like this  it wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:11:46 Rip that poor tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:12:52 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:15:09 I had a hilarious conversation with a kid on roblox yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:15:19 He told me mesh cars are superior to brick built cars lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:16:09 You cant make a mesh car actually crash and crumple and you also have no way of truly protecting its original assets, All of my brick built cars in studio are almost impossible to steal since i never upload them to the site and their only files are the occasional unions rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:16:28 I think i might try to make my sandrail on plane crazy idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:16:40 It's more of a dune buggy than a sandrail though
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:18:13 Actually im just gonna make a giant offroad vehicle instead, idk how the hell i would pull that off with that sandrail rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:32:07 I had a bit of fun redoing the back of one of my cars in studio earlier rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:32:26 I wanted to puke over the old rear i made for my car so i decided to put a new one on it
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:32:32 The one on the left was the old design for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:37 I had to make a monstrosity of parts to make the rear suspension on my truck rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:33:43 The rear suspension on my trucks chassis literally looks like a blob of parts
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:33:49 Like it works sure but damn aint pretty one bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:34:11 
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:36:56 That's just the chassis for my truck, it's "body" is ugly aswell though rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:37:26 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:49:04 I find it slightly triggering that i have to make blocks to limit the steering angle on my truck
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:49:32 I mean i guess it works still but adjustable limits would come in handy rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:50:08 I turn lightmode on to put myself through suffering for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:13:58 I would do a hilarious loophole with that teaching someone how to script thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:14:06 "You gotta teach me how to script every single thing in existence"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:14:13 "then i will pay you 1 mil robux"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:14:20 = sadly they could never do that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:28:37 Welp, it's nice there's finally servos with limits on em
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:28:56 Now i don't need to make a mechanical steering stop just to make the steering not "oversteer" and fold the wheels under the chassis...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:26:23 I did a few alterations on my truck
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:26:57 Not the greatest looking truck but eh, at least the rear suspension is the one thing that actually had a fair bit done to it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:28:17 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:28:48 It's basically just a modified tandem suspension system
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:34:25 That truck i made used to have a truck bed but i literally had to take it out because the rear suspension was getting too err "complex"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:34:41 If we ever get thinner motors that'll come in handy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:36:50 Half block wedges in longer lengths?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:36:52 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:37:18 I ended up needing a half block wedge in 2 studs length but like there wasnt one so i just got stuck doing unnecessary alterations
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:11:41 I find it slightly triggering how my truck can still "throw" itself
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:11:45 Even though i set its torque to 5
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:12:14 Literally if i floor it then "reverse" it'll send the truck flipping over onto its roof
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:12:41 You should try using a spring kubeczek to force it to push the cylinders tightly together
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:12:54 It might work idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:16:09 I wonder if i can make my radial engine on plane crazy or not
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:16:27 I ended up making this a while back on a building game back when springloaded engines did function
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:16:47 But of course, springloaded engines are entirely useless now since they sorta patched that minor flaw in the springs
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:17:37 Like it used to function well enough to the point that you could start the engine just by turning the propeller a couple times to get it to start the cycle
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:17:46 And as soon as it started running it would run on its own for a good 10 mins
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:17:51 Even though its entirely scriptless
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:18:02 The only script it had was the rpm gauge i had wired to it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:20:57 Moments before disaster
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:21:05 ripperoni
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:21:05 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:21:16 Ironically you'd think the back of the truck would be the heaviest
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:21:18 Not even close.
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:21:25 It's actually the front and there's not even an "engine" in the front
general 2019-09-12 16:25:21 Best accessory ever https://www.roblox.com/catalog/3871639140/Human-Cosplay
general 2019-09-12 16:25:54 These work too though https://www.roblox.com/catalog/434290315/BFG-Giant-Ears
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:26:29 The rear suspension is a custom tandem suspension, it weighs a fair bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:27:27 It might of been because i took a pic while it was in mid air though
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:27:38 Since for some stupid reason the game has no functioning torque adjustment still for motors...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:28:18 Like i literally set the motor torque to 5 and my truck still throws itself if i'm driving it quick then reverse fast it ends up just flipping it onto its roof
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:29:07 It's literally to do with the motor speed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:29:26 Like i was expecting motor speed to being a motor top speed not its acceleration speed and the motor speed combined
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:37:30 ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:37:45 Wdym by that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:37:52 The spring tensioning?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:38:08 You could just replace the piston with a suspension spring, max out the stiffness and dampening on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:38:33 Then adjust its freelength to push on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:40:45 Fun times when the game lags as soon as you go to drive your plane/vehicle
general 2019-09-12 16:41:26 Mathew you could legit use that as some alien character
general 2019-09-12 16:41:39 Two ears, two noses, creepy
general 2019-09-12 16:41:45 Now ye just gotta find out how to get 4 eyes next
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 01:52:06 rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 01:57:09 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:02:07 Scrap mechanic suffers from a bit of an irritating thing though
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:02:17 If you try to make complex suspension on a vehicle it can cause it to uh
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:02:39 It'll act like there's a gyroscope on it pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:02:50 Forcing it to remain upright at all times making it near impossible to go up hills
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:02:57 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:03:12 Oh i run into it all the time without even trying
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:03:24 It just happens to plague 90% of my builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:03:58 Also, i finished my truck on plane crazy, it's still not the nicest in terms of aesthetics but considering its my first truck it's not bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:06:12 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:07:05 I was actually considering trying to join up as a mod but i just thought of how irritating that would be
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:07:15 Im already a mod in a game and two discord servers and a group
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:07:47 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:09:02 I find it triggering how bad roblox handles advanced things at times
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:09:13 I have a sandrail that actually explodes if i hit a jump and hit the ground hard enough
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:09:22 It doesn't really explode more so just vanishes out of existence without warning
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:09:47 It's this, I kinda want to make it on plane crazy but i know it would be rather difficult to pull off
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:09:58 It's using pushrod suspension in both the front and rear
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:10:42 Ironically it drives flawlessly until i end up sending it flying into the ground and roblox decides to have a mental breakdown
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:10:58 One thing i don't get though
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:11:05 If i have a friend in the other seat on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:11:08 The thing wont blow up at all
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:11:26 It even works fine if i launch a second client and hop into it rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:12:44 Rip roblox then damn
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:12:59 I might try fiddling with the game settings to see if minor adjustments do anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:13:20 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:13:39 I'm talking about roblox though in general, not plane crazy's physics
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:14:03 Like none of my builds on plane crazy blew up = for now
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:15:38 Wdym 4 axis
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 02:16:49 ngl the camber triggers me
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:50:42 I keep getting bugged by people to race them with my truck so i decided to try to build a car, not done yet though
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:53:06 What's that red wall from?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:53:14 Like i've seen it ingame countless times but always wondered what it was
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:54:34 I went faster than that on games before k
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:54:37 Like y'know
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:54:42 when robloxs physics commit potato
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:54:46 and the car just goes flinging off the map
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 10:54:51 And turns into a distorted ball of parts
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:17:16 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:17:46 If you think that's bad the server i moderate on is much more strict
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:17:59 16 alone is pushing it in terms of age
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:18:19 Most of the mods are 18 or older and active a mass amount of the time
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:18:47 I mean it makes sense though, give someone the ability to literally do a kill all command in game if they wanted, if it was someone who was younger and easily set off it could cause problems
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:19:04 Like i've met a few users on roblox that i personally wanted to strangle ngl
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:19:18 Forking out over 100 alts on a daily basis trying to do server takeovers with exploits
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:19:39 And considering roblox is as bad as it is with their exploit prevention most of the patches are done ingame
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:19:49 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:19:55 I moderate three things for that one game
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:20:09 Their discord server, their groups, their game
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:20:17 It's slightly irritating at times
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:20:19 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:20:39 I was considering joining as a mod here but i don't feel like getting the extra stress of it
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:21:55 I just noticed something and im triggered now
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:22:12 I accidentally made the wheel wells on my car offscale to what the game would "allow"
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:22:25 They should of been 3 studs in the middle or 1 stud
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:22:29 Accidentally made em 2
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:41:28 I think i figured out the wheel spacing on my car in a bit of a bad way
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:41:39 I literally just used pistons to center the suspension in the wheel wells
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 13:00:40 Shame we don't have density adjustments or high density blocks to mess with cause like
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 13:00:46 Higher density constraints are much more stable
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 13:14:09 I had to do something a bit rediculous just to get the steering on my car to stay stable
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 13:14:20 It has 6 servos responsible for steering its two front wheels now rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 13:14:33 But needless to say it's pretty solid now in terms of steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:15:06 Ik it'd certainly get someone a lot of disrespect copying others
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:15:26 But aside from that im not too sure rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:15:54 Ik if someone were to post their "creation" and someone else ends up copying it and posting a pic of their copy they might get in trouble if its confirmed who the original maker is
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:17:26 Yeah you can tell he is trying to copy it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:17:29 Not a very good copy though
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:17:58 Like i see some designs shared but he didn't really get it right so in that term its pretty much almost a different plane still
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:25:57 I was considering submitting my truck into the contest but i changed my mind, It's scale sorta limited it from having any extra "detail"
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:28:15 It was my first truck though so i wouldn't really say its bad considering it was a good build for my first land vehicle on the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:29:22 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:29:47 The only part of it i'd say that still sets it apart is the rear suspension but aside from that its still a pretty "normal" build
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:30:08 The rear suspension ended up costing me a truck bed though.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:30:12 Since now there's just a giant hole in the back of it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:30:34 No it's not a jeep no
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:30:46 Just a truck
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:31:25 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:31:38 I was originally just building more of a retro styled truck though
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:31:47 Like it used to have yellow headlights but i just changed them to white when i repainted it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:32:02 Since it was all white last time cause i had no clue what to do for a color scheme on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:32:59 I think its just mid-sized
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:33:01 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:40:10 I'm gonna try to build new front suspension on my truck, probs gonna fail badly
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:51:36 Simple jefferey, get a warp drive
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 13:51:48 so you can go real quick
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:37:54 I'm dealing with a bit of a triggering thing rn rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:38:08 Trying to somehow squeeze a slightly more advanced suspension system in the front end of my truck
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:38:24 Rn i'm trying to find a way to put a hood on it because well, the suspension is too "tall" in the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:52:36 I managed to give my truck some slightly better front suspension, not very complex though but cramming it into the front was a pain
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:52:45 It's just "swingarm" suspension mounted sideways
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:53:14 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:53:21 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:53:30 The mechanism was too tall to fit under the original hood rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:53:35 That hood scoop wasnt a design plan one bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:53:58 It actually had to be added otherwise there would just be a hole in the hood so the suspension's hinges wouldnt weld to it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:57:23 This is basically the mess of parts underneath the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:57:28 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:58:10 Not without having it weld to the body it cant.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:58:40 I've been messing around with that for a bit trying to make everything work without it welding itself to the body of the truck
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:59:39 I guess the kinda cool thing is when its "flexing" on an angle it looks almost like a solid axle suspension system
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:59:48 I was trying to put double wishbone suspension in the front end earlier but it didn't really work out well
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:59:57 Since the control arms would of been too low to the ground
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:01:01 I cant help but cringe when someone says they made 4 link suspension on plane crazy and i see it and im just like damn thats not even remotely close to its real life counterpart
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:01:30 Like i've built 4 link suspension before in studio and it was never anything remotely close to what people dare call "4 link" on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:02:03 I'll show a pic of an old rock crawler of mine from 2016, It uses a triangulated 4 link
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:03:16 Like this is my old 4 link rock crawler from 2016, It's just a chassis of course
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:03:30 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:03:47 But yeah this is what a triangulated 4 link actually looks like...  rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:04:12 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:04:29 That's why i find it funny when someone calls their suspension a 4 link layout but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:04:40 You don't see anything remotely close to the real ones.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:04:53 Couldn't they just give their suspension a new name rather than try to name it after something it isn't?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:05:38 Because like me being a car/truck person i get triggered by people calling their suspension somethin it aint
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:05:46 Same like when they call suspension "suspensions"
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:06:22 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:06:28 ngl the front is a bit too long
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:06:36 If it were a bit shorter then that'd be fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:06:55 You wouldn't even want to know what the monstrosity's i've done when i wasnt paying attention to scale
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:07:04 I built a lamborghini on roblox a while back in 2015
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:07:08 And i made it look like a pancake
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:07:14 Because i wasnt paying attention to the scaling on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:09:23 Kinda a shame that there's not  really any way to make a true 4 link system on plane crazy atm
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:09:49 I mean im sure it'd be possible if the building area was bigger, could probs get away with making linkages out of deactivated motors & blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:09:57 But that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:11:41 When roblox was down on the 21st i was actually still building in studio
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:11:52 Also yielding, i don't mean to sound rude but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:12:24 Plane crazy is a different type of game than most are, it's building style is a part of the game, if you change that it wouldn't really be the same game.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:12:36 It'd ruin it pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:13:28 Like i stick to making my complex creations in studio not really on other games
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:13:42 The hell is that
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:14:06 What was that on?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:14:20 Like if im seeing it correctly that grey spinning block has two thrusters on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:14:22 To spin it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:14:55 I was making this thing two days ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:14:58 Idk if i'll finish it ngl
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:15:16 It'll be entirely mechanical aside from well the obivious part
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:15:18 The drive system
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:15:25 The steering will be mechanical aswell as the suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:15:41 Because like rn i still cant figure out how to get my mechanical driveshafts to be small and stable enough for front steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:16:11 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:16:19 But yeah its a 6 link layout in the rear
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:16:22 And a 5 link in the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:16:39 I could put a friction differential in the back of that thing but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:17:06 I cant make a driveshaft compact enough that would move with the steering & be stable because welp, roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:17:14 I'd have to make it a hell of alot bigger to get away with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:17:20 Since tiny parts spinning at a high velocity = bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:17:47 Yeah you wouldn't really wanna run into the issues i have with driveshafts
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:18:15 Try the fact making a driveshaft in a steering system is very uh
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:18:16 triggering
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:18:30 It has to be specifically put together otherwise you'll have limited steering angles
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:18:51 I've done it years ago on roblox but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:19:00 I want to make it at a realistic scale not something oversized
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:19:11 Roblox quite frantically just hates tiny parts though.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:21:05 If your trying to get them to move while under heavy stress it can be troublesome.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:21:56 Yielding, I've been building mechanical suspension on roblox for over 6 years, I know for a fact that if you try to make compact cv joints in a steering system then expose it to heavy stress it'll explode.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:22:06 Unless roblox fixed their trash physics.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:22:31 Because last time i tried doing that it literally exploded as soon as the wheel got caught on something it "tore" the cv joint to shreds
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:23:00 black_bird, I'm talking about cv joints in the front drive system of an awd vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:23:11 Constant Velocity joints.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:23:33 It's easy to make a driveshaft stable when it only has to move up and down & stay straight
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:23:42 But as soon as your trying to get it to bend sideways for steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:23:44 it can get a bit weird.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:25:56 Black_bird, there's a bit of a thing i have against fake things.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:10 I don't like err.... "hiding" what things are
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:15 Like if i make a mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:29 I show the mechanism & not make it look like something it isnt
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:40 Like you know those people who make fake suspension on cars on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:49 Like having detailed "live axle" suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:26:54 But it ends up just being prismatic suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:27:01 And all of its visible "suspension" was just for show.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:27:26 Basically just saying i don't like invisible parts.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:47:16 I literally went under some afk guys ship while it was in the water with my plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:47:24 And just flew straight up and flung his ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:47:25 rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:47:50 I'm thinking of converting my old plane to servos since its still using "mechanically limited" motors for the wing angles
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:48:10 But the only irritating thing is you don't have full angle restriction controls yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:48:31 Like say you want a servo with -30 and 40 degrees for its limits
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:48:37 It wont let you on plane crazy of course.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:48:53 Because if you set the angle limit to 40 it'll set it to -40 and 40 for the limits
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:49:20 Hopefully that becomes a feature later on though
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:50:45 I mean with some minor alterations it could fit on the gui.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:50:57 But since uh
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:51:08 the gui was sized so it was easy to see = sorta limits it because of the giant font
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 15:51:31 Guess i'll stick to using mechanically limited motors as servos on any of my builds that need specific angle limits.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:06:39 rickje, Ik this is a crappy "edit" but this was sorta what i meant by the gui could get altered
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:09:36 I'm already triggered by that
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:09:42 "activate windows" damn
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:11:21 There's actually more than a few trolls here that like to downvote everything regardless of how good it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:27:05 Some dude in my server keeps spamming help me in the chat because he flew his plane into the ocean/lake
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:31:39 I just did the cruelist thing ever
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:31:46 Tricked the dude into thinking i was "rescuing" him
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:31:50 He hopped on top of my plane and like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:31:58 I just immediately darted the plane forward and he got flung
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 16:32:37 That guy was getting irritating though, spamming help me in the chat a good 50-60 times
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:06 I made a tank chassis in studio a while back that happened to be too laggy to even use apparently but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:15 It did have some sort of suspension for its drive rollers
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:33 Well not always vipempire
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:41 If your taking the simple way around.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:35 This was the tank chassis i was working on in studio quite a while back
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:54 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:39 I kinda get disturbed by some tank tracks people use on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:47 They don't add any "treds" to it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:59 It ends up being smooth tracks with nothing able to grab surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:11 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:12 Like see
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:18 On my tank since it has the small parts sticking out
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:24 It can actually grab ahold of objects its driving over
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:30 And pull itself up
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:39 The concept still would work.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:53 I already know plane crazy requires a pretty different type of "tracks"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:48:00 But that can still be applied.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:48:17 Plates/Treds, Whatever.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:48:21 You could call it nubs for all i care.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:48:31 Treads/Treds
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:50:11 Damn this is the time when the morons come online isnt it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:50:23 I bet we got 7 year olds here claiming to know the old roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:50:30 As soon as some older player mentions something of the "old times"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:50:45 Don't worry, i wouldn't want to know you.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:51:17 Yeah didn't really sound like you were joking.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:51:57 Considering i literally saw them spell out "tred" at a bike shop for tires i assumed that was an alternate way of saying "treads"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:52:19 There's an age old argument by the way that still goes on, "color" and "colour"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:52:32 By the way
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:52:37 That low key looks like the facebook log in page
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:53:36 I've literally gotten raged at by people on roblox for saying "color"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:54:24 Also, the reason i have no roles is literally just because i don't bother with trying to get any of them atm since there's still trolls who keep downvoting the hell out of everything i put in creations
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:54:40 I literally put a picture of my plane in creations and in less than a minute it got downvoted 10 times
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:55:42 Thats my first plane on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:01:36 That plane of mine as i mentioned earlier was my first plane, At least i can say one thing, It's not "horrible" for being a first plane.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:03:13 Considering it was downvoted in the short time period like almost instantly after it was posted was a bit of a giveaway that someone was trolling.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:04:30 I see people like to nitpick over tiny things here?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:04:44 I bet someone could misplace one brick in a build with over 4000 parts and get raged at for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:05:26 Some moron called one of my builds a jeep because they didn't know what the hell a jeep looked like
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:05:38 saw the two circular headlights and jumped to the conclusion that "it must be a jeep"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:12 It was my first truck that got called a "jeep"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:17 Last time i checked jeeps don't look anything remotely close to that
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:21 Jeeps have slotted grills.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:39 That's a Volkswagen beetle
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:49 Why would you even like deadass try to call that a jeep
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:51 damn
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:07:12 I'll just jump the "conclusion" and assume nobody here is a car guy
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:08:16 Probs the same kind of person who sees a pontiac fiero and assumes its a ferrari
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:22:56 Liberalism? trash
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:22:59 government? trash
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:15 no u prom night dumpster mistake
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:17 eat shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:31 toxic little 7 year old got mad
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:24:14 shinxlevi, you'd be surprised what kind of things go on in discord
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:24:41 I've had a squeaky ass voice kid hop into a vc with me once and i ended up muting him within minutes of him popping on there.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:25:35 darkz_uwu is a toxic kid
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:25:39 lil squeaker box
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:25:52 probs picks his nose
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:26:26 He just consciously picks his nose shoving pieces of snot into his mouth without even realizing he's doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:26:59 ok monkey man
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:27:06 go back to your cardboard box
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:27:10 you shitstain
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:28:07 go back to your box you stupid hermit crab
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:28:38 = Personally i'm not too concerned about being banned, I actually don't really like this disc server much
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:28:50 Plus if im seeing things correctly
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:29:02 Doesn't look like a mod is even doing anything yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:29:16 This server is like atf i swear
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:29:23 Night time being the time when every toxic little shit hops on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:30:00 Darkz, You literally said that countless times and i still don't care.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:30:08 What makes you think repeating it over and over will make it mean something.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:30:34 I didn't say that i didn't like them.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:30:54 The only thing i'd say to them is obey the laws & not complain when they get told to follow them.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:31:30 The entire system is flawed that's why.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:31:36 Politics are trash in general
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:31:46 Just something to argue over at the end of the day.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:32:13 You should know people get toxic over politics.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:32:40 Y'know, just look at trump
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:32:44 That's evidence enough.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:32:54 Trump and his little cardboard box
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:33:09 America is gonna be the next gen north korea shitbox
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:33:28 Atleast it'll remain that way until trump gets his fat ass out of the white house
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:34:09 Where did furrys come in?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:34:16 I don't believe anyone mentioned furrys
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:34:23 Also that's not a furry ye dingus
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:34:32 Someone didn't take history class
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:34:58 Considering the anubis is literally a jackal headed man
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:35:02 Its far from being a furry
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:35:24 The only furry "thing" on him is his damn head.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:35:47 darkz_uwu must of hit his head pretty hard
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:36:10 The entire system is a problem k
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:36:18 Regardless of who you vote for you get something bad in return
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:36:26 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:36:33 someones gotta pay the price regardless
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:37:07 Y'know still didn't make free health care that's what
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:37:08 k
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:37:16 I'm stickin to canada, you can have fun with america
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:37:19 i aint ever gonna set foot there
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:37:56 no u shit monkey
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:38:06 crawl back into the dumpster you came out of
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:38:47 yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:38:54 7 year olds are quite like monkeys
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:39:01 monkey see monkey do = exactly what a 7 year old does
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:47:40 Needless to say, it gets real toxic here at night
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:47:44 From what i've witnessed so far
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:48:01 I was trying to have a normal convo earlier, ended up saying treds instead of treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:48:04 And that started it all
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:48:21 Ye then the "shit" hit the fan
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:48:57 Yeah perhaps it should get considered that not everyone likes "cruel" jokes.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:49:19 I correct people for typos at times but don't tend to make fun of them for it, unless they were being rude.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:52:22 That literally sounds like talking about the kind of person at a party who makes a bad joke, then gets mad at you for not finding it funny
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:52:39 Personally i don't find anything funny about making toxic jokes just to try to piss someone off.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:53:18 I get joking around sure but when it starts getting rude that's where i'd say it becomes less of a joke and more so just bullying in general.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:03:05 Doesn't mean that the attempt cant be made to have a better community.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:04:03 I personally hate arguing with people but when someone decides to try to "bully" me for some stupid reason i can't help but get mad back.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:04:10 I mean i could just ignore everything they say sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:04:40 I could just say in my opinion.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:04:44 That's pretty much the same thing.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:05:10 Anyways though, In way i am sort of sorry for arguing with them but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:05:25 If they don't apologize back i could honestly care less.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:05:51 mocmish, that's why you don't stay up late to the point you make typos
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:06:31 Honestly i already muted this server though because of the countless pings i got over that little arguement
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:09:42 I don't tend to block people unless they get endlessly toxic
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:09:54 Like you know those people who just decide to get toxic with you whenever you go online?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:23:58 It has only just begun
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:24:01 👀
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 19:49:06 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:29:06 Im kinda bad at those speed typin stoof still
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:44:04 Y'know what would be op if it was "simple" to pull off
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:44:09 Having a bunch of little drones armed
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:44:13 and remotely controlling each one
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:44:21 And just sorta swarm someone in pvp and fire at them from all sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 14:37:59 Someone should make the Antonov A-40
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 14:38:05 cause its cringe
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:04:06 👀
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:05:09 It's recommended to at least act your age, or just act mature in general.
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:05:31 Joking around is fine sure, but when immaturity causes problems that's when i'd say draw the line there.
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:05:46 Because like im sure all of us could admit it gets out of hand at times.
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:06:40 The only rick i depend on is rick sanchez cause he's gettin me that szechuan sauce k
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:06:51 he's gonna raid the space vault
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:06:53 and imma get it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 11:07:43 Rip.
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:30:35 I found the power armor in fallout new vegas and fallout 3 triggering
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:30:38 they let a bug go unfixed in both games
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:30:44 If you sit the pauldrons will tilt
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:31:10 Tea isn't bad but i just prefer coffee
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:31:24 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:31:33 On fallout 4 i had a giant rideable mech
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:31:36 But like the problem was
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:31:44 It would occasionally turn hostile against my companions
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:32:01 Having a giant 15 ft tall robot suddenly go hostile and start attacking your companions = triggering
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:32:34 Next time i'll just completly leave my companions behind so they can quit getting in its way
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:32:47 Fallout 76 was a mistake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:07 Y'know there was one thing i liked about fallout 76
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:08 the pip boy
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:11 Nostalgia in general.
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:14 But that was it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:30 Yes but not the same one as fallout 76
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:33:51 Ik
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:34:08 It was the Pip Boy 2000 Mk VI
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:34:17 I almost was tempted to buy the model of it but like
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:34:22 I was thinking about how useless it'd be
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:34:39 I'd rather have one that would have a working display that controlled the radio on it etc
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:36:46 Someone needs to make a tea that is literally just cinnamon
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:36:50 just to put people through suffering
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:37:32 I was trying to make a submarine on plane crazy and like
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:37:36 I hate the appearance of it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:37:44 But i only have one thing to say about it, it still works like a submarine
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:37:55 even though it looks like complete utter trash and id rather burn the thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:41:59 There is a difference between the two you know?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:09 The spring has no prismatic in it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:14 So it literally moves in any direction
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:26 And well the suspension one just has a prismatic with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:42 Not entirely certain what the spring was for still i never found a use for it
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 18:07:37 👀
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:06:46 I made some ugly "Thing" out of boredom, shockingly it does work after fiddling around with it for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:06:48 Idk what to even call it
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:07:29 
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:07:44 
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:09:00 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:09:04 
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 05:09:53 It's sorta like a flying bike? I'm not even sure
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 02:24:04 That's pretty cringe.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:41:36 Just curious, has anyone built any functional popup headlights on plane crazy yet?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:42:13 I haven't seen any yet, it just makes me wonder how many are actually already built by people
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:42:47 I was trying to make popup headlights on one of my cars but since parts weld together regardless i ended up having to use a bunch of pistons to align the mechanism after its been "spawned in"
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:46:47 This entire mess is the crappy popup headlights mechanism i made
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:47:44 
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:47:50 
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 14:48:07 I'm probs just gonna give up on making the popup headlights honestly
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 16:45:31 Why do people even do this
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 16:45:48 I swear it's like when someone just goes on plane crazy and like
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 16:45:56 immediately spams rockets all over their base
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 16:46:06 and then just places a seat and just sends them all flying
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 16:47:05 He just left this pile of "parachutes"
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:28:32 I'm making somethin "cursed"
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:28:39 It's a small truck pulling around a massive camper trailer
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:29:08 I feel like im probably going to have to put duallies on it cause its been spinning out the back wheels whenever it trys to run up that one hill by the lab
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:29:19 The truck is too small for the trailer
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:29:26 It's like having a toyota hilux pulling a full size camper trailer
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:29:52 Don't worry i'll hide bodys under the floorboards in the trailer
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:30:29 I'm talkin about like those
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:30:33 old hilux's
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:30:37 Those small little pickup trucks
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:02 
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:04 cursed
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:28:49 Dang that range rover though
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:10:40 Uh
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:10:46 There's a major problem on plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:10:54 You can move your builds into other peoples bases...
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:11:01 Someone was just moving their train through a bunch of peoples bases
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:11:04 And i went to test that
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:11:11 And yeah it legit let my move my build onto someones elses base
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:25:33 Y'know, someone could abuse that like mad in a vip server
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:25:40 Making extremely massive ships
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:25:54 Like i mean literally using all the bases as a huge building plot
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 01:26:05 Building it in sections then every time your base is "filled" just move it over
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 05:16:11 I had someone try to do that to me so like
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 05:16:22 I moved my truck i was building right into his stupid "box"
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 05:16:34 And it got his dumb box car jammed right in the front of it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:40 I'm planning something bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:49 
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:53 I'm going to make a swarm of my flying bikes
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:35:15 It only has 67 parts on its own so it's easy to replicate for the most part rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 22:54:57 Y'know what someone needs to make
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 22:55:00 the flying ship from fallout 4
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 04:57:19 This is cursed
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 12:52:33 I built a "Monstrosity" on plane crazy rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:22 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:24 I uh
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:28 Got in an extremely broken server
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:36 Somehow i own a base with me and another player
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:41 
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:56 
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:41:57 See
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:02 Not a single blue base now
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:06 Really?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:07 Damn
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:14 First time i encountered that bug
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:19 Also ngl that tank thing looks kinda cool-ish
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:42:20 XD
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 23:27:47 Dang that bird thing though
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 23:28:15 I find that map a bit triggering-ish
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 23:29:18 Idk all these terrain maps people keep doing looks like everyone just keeps using the autogenerate feature
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 23:29:26 And then just plopping a few models down
general 2019-11-18 03:15:25 Have you guys heard about the new grass yet?
general 2019-11-18 03:15:46 Roblox's "Animated" grass they added
general 2019-11-18 03:16:02 Here's a short video of it i guess idk https://gyazo.com/edab1ca2e2c3b75fb51f4a328cbb59c5
general 2019-11-18 03:16:26 You turn it on here
general 2019-11-18 03:16:38 It's supposed to be getting released to public game clients in a few weeks
general 2019-11-18 03:24:17 Hopefully when it gets released to public game clients it'll be enabled on plane crazy
general 2019-11-18 04:10:59 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:12:27 Tiny like this? Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:12:54 Only 67 parts on that flying bike
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:12:58 "thing"
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:15:45 I honestly think i could of gotten some ranks before here but i never bothered to get any ranks lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:17:04 I built this about 2 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:11:17 I just had a headache and a half trying to cram double wishbone suspension into the front of my truck rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:12:01 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:12:10 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:12:16 It was literally jammed in there with no room left.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:12:26 One small corner of the front grill is the motor rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:13:00 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:13:21 I might of been able to make it smaller if i wasn't trying to keep my steering system i already made
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:13:38 Like i keep the servo as close as possible to the wheel for a better steering angle
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:13:47 That way it won't hit the wheel well when steering
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:14:16 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:14:42 Since the farther you offset the servo from the wheel the more it'll end up turning, besides that can lead to some very wobbly steering rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:16:02 Its a truck though, I'm keeping it AWD, Keeping the servos that close to the wheel actually helps with quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:16:20 Letting it get sharper steering angles with a smaller wheel well, the steering wont tuck in from torque either
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:40:49 I managed to finally put in the extra springs in the front suspension on my truck, now it doesn't need the stupid helium blocks i had to put in just to offset the weight rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:44:16 I was doing it at first honestly just to see if my suspension would actually work properly in it considering how crammed it is
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:44:31 I'm just glad something stupid didn't happen to it in the process
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 21:45:11 new update: fortnite deleted
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:06:52 Makes me wonder what he calls his space ship.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:51:13 This dude has a sick ship mg
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:51:25 
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:52:00 The guy doesn't speak english though so i don't think he'd know if i complimented it or not, probs just gonna walk over and do a thumbs up "emoji" i guess lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:32:01 Idk what to even say about that
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:40:01 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:42:35 Welp, that's a sad fate right there
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:56:19 I just caught some random noob copying my truck = ended up leaving rip
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:56:22 Not even surprised honestly
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 15:56:37 I'm so used to people going around taking a ton of pics of my builds then making the chinese knockoff edition of it.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:01:12 That doesn't really help much honestly
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:01:17 Considering they can still see your build
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:01:26 Not walk up to it sure but seeing it from a distance yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:01:42 The guy got the scale wrong anyways so regardless his will be bad compared to mine.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:01:54 Mine is complex underneath.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:02:11 A bit complex on the outside since its scale restricts anything "more" rip.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:02:37 If i was to build a gigantic truck that literally ends up having block built wheels then yes i probably could make it extremely difficult for them to try.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:02:52 I have builds in studio that would literally give anyone a headache to recreate.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:03:02 Even though morons assume at first glance its easy until the outlines get turned on.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:03:11 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:03:38 I gave myself a headache just building my trucks front suspension so i already know that guy who was trying to copy me wont manage to copy it easily
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:03:51 
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:02 It's a double wishbone front suspension system crammed into it with barely any room to spare
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:24 
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:26 I just love how the guy literally was like
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:28 "Nice"
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:36 then proceeded to attempt to copy my work as if it didn't mean anything
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:45 Reminds me so much of build and race honestly
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:04:54 People on build and race back in 2013 were like that
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:05:02 They'd compliment your work then proceed to take tons of pictures
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:05:08 Only to see them with some crude copy a week later
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:05:13 Claiming to be the original maker of it
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:06:15 Like i mean i could care less if i saw someone building something with some aspects of my build considering the scale of my truck its inevitable
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:06:34 But when someone ends up trying to build an exact replica that's when its a bit of a piss off if anything.
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:15:43 Oh y'know
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:15:47 build a giant mech with hands and feet
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:15:54 and go play football with it
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:16:15 = if only it was that easy
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:38:38 Some guy is being a literal creep in my game rn
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:38:45 going around being like "are you a girl"
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:38:54 And if someones dressed like a girl he just starts following them around
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:39:08 It's kinda cringe ngl
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:40:02 Not even gonna bother to censor his name out
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:40:11 I mean the dude is a literal creep, deserves to be known here
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:40:22 = people like that shouldn't even be on roblox honestly
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:48:26 I'm building some real ugly body on my buggy chassis
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:06:39 I did some uh
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:06:45 hidden door? On my rv
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:06:48 
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:07:34 
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:07:54 Basically when the door opens it pushes back the "block" at the top thats just springloaded
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:08:07 That when when its closed there isn't some like massive gap inbetween the door and the bodywork
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:09:21 Well not with the mechanism layout on mine, it wouldn't allow it
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:40:46 I just thought of something really dark involving my rv
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:40:52 Since its door can be opened and closed
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:40:59 And the fact it looks like an oversized van...
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 22:41:16 Well if signs get added and i just so happen to paint it white and write free candy on the side.... = that'd just get dark real quick
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 23:04:25 Acdakota
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 23:04:34 This is what happened last time i went to swap my cpu
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 23:04:36 JK
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 23:04:54 That's the kind of stuff that you'd expect when you pay a guy at a computer shop 5 cents to go swap a cpu
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:58:13 I got the best truck ever k
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:58:16 
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:58:21 totally isn't destroyed or anything, it's in tip top shape
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:58:27 Ready to go hit the road
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:58:46 Kinda looks like what you'd expect when you go to buy a truck from a craigslist ad
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 00:59:01 Says the truck is in excellent condition, turns out to look like its been through WW3
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:09 Some guy/kid in my server literally was copying the front of my truck
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:15 Then when my friend asked him about it he blacklisted him
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:19 = kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:30 Robicksi was the one doing it
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:46 Got asked by my friend if he was the one who "designed" that and he just stayed silent
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:53:55 And after getting asked 2 more times he blacklisted him for it
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 02:54:36 Like i was literally just working on my rv and the kid starts building a copy of it right next to my base and its just like r u srs kid
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:05:25 This is what that kid is doing btw
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:05:38 I have him blacklisted and anti copy enabled on him but like
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:05:48 He legit just follows me whenever i drive it
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:06:00 = I swear next time the kid does it im gonna smack that stupid thing off the map on him
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:06:25 He does have this thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:06:27 But i assume that things copied too
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:06:30 Or from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:08:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:08:20 That guy robicksi hasn't even seen my rv's inside
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 03:08:36 Has no clue how its front suspension works, he could probably figure out the rear suspension though since its only like 5 parts
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:45:23 Is anyone else having the same issue im having involving motor 2's?
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:45:34 Whenever i get out of the drivers seat on my build and re-enter it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:45:40 The motor 2's lock up and stop working
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:48:24 Oh weird i just saw something about it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:48:35 So for some reason it will not lock up if i leave it steered slightly before exiting it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:48:47 But if the servos are at their starting position when exiting they break.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:48:56 Yep.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:04 I wasnt sure if it was just one of my builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:12 So i checked 6 different other ones, all of them were doing it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:32 No error codes come up from it either
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:41 So i don't think i could really send a screenshot about it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:49 The servos just act as though they're jammed
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:49:58 And will only "wiggle" slightly when attempted to move them
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:52:29 I've had random people hunt me down when they see me driving my cars or trucks
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:52:42 Just because it's a "land vehicle" so they try to do some aerial attack on it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:53:55 Yeah i've had that happen to me before
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 15:54:13 It's irritating, tends to happen whenever i load one of my bigger vehicles.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 16:28:34 I wonder if its the exact same issue i was dealing with
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 16:29:10 The motor2's locking up after hopping out of the "pilot seat" and re-entering it
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:40:46 I was looking at bug-reports and i take it rickje still cant find out why motor2's are breaking
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:41:28 I literally told him the exact step by step process as to what leads to them breaking every single time, If the motor2 set to servo and centered if you exit the pilot seat and re-enter it the motor2 immediately breaks and no longer moves.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:41:42 At least not properly, it'll just wiggle around almost like its limits got messed with.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:51:13 Idk about you but when the winter event comes back
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:51:21 Im definitely making a snowmobile using those conveyors as its tracks
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 14:51:26 Just to make a compact little snowmobile for jokes
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:11:18 I'm just watching some guy trying to copy my plane rn, kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:11:30 He doesn't even know the underlying mechanics of it but eh i'll just see where his copy goes.
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:12:07 I might, just to see if he'll give up lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:12:17 He keeps messing up on the length though
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:12:21 He literally just redid it 5 times
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:12:27 Because he cant get the length of my plane right
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:13:01 
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:13:24 He's literally trying to copy my first plane i ever built just because he saw it dart off through the air almost instantly = i was messing around with those uh
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:13:27 conveyor "engines"
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:16:01 I skipped the tutorial lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:16:09 I was just doing trial and error
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:16:28 My friend mentioned to me about the centre of mass and lift so i just took that into consideration when i built that
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:17:20 Just turned on the blacklist and anti copy once he got to this point, Kinda curious what he's gonna do now
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:23:04 That guy is legit failing so bad at copying my plane its hilarious to watch
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:23:06 
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:23:21 I already blacklisted him but he's still determined to attempt
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:28:40 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:28:59 You gotta admit though it's pretty priceless when some kid starts copying someones elses work
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:29:08 Then claims they made it yet there was proof of the original
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:29:22 If he's on this discord server he's likely just being real quiet rn
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:30:22 SeaMasterPirate, If you mean the guy who's badly trying to copy my plane.
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:31:01 Here's to hoping if he does go here and trys to upload it to creations
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:31:12 Someones gonna end up getting him a nice warning over that one
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:31:20 Because i've uploaded a picture of it a while back
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:32:28 I had KSP before, ended up just getting a refund on it
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:32:36 Since i didn't like it as much as i used to
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:49:06 Not gonna lie, I like that ford build 9theking10
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:49:10 But you ruined it with that back.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:49:27 The 2006 Ford GT Tungsten edition is a beauty honestly.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:49:59 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:50:05 I like the rims on it honestly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:50:30 I still have to get a SSD for my computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:50:43 One of the stick style one's, Only irritating part is that their not all the same.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:51:09 Sata connector ones are generally not a problem since they all connect the same and can usually just fit in a normal harddrive bay
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:51:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:51:32 Like i mean there's different lengths
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:51:47 Well atleast with the one that my computer holds apparently.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:04 I brought it down to a shop and the guy there showed me a few of them
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:11 Like they had the same connectors
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:14 But the SSD's themselves
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:18 Were different lengths
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:30 Issue is if i get one that isn't the right length
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:52:33 It wont screw in properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:53:16 I'm gonna be buying a samsung one online from amazon
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:53:25 Because my computers like cutting it close on the memory because well
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:53:26 = mods
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:53:32 I have a fair bit of mods on some of my games
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:53:45 Plus i have a massive game collection on my computer that i'm trying to well, Build up i guess.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:13 302 gigabytes free out of my computers 1 TB hdd
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:15 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:24 Yeah sadly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:36 Not when your downloading massive games it aint
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:37 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:47 But like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:54:57 For now i don't want to do a hard drive replacement
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:12 Since i don't have a seperate computer to transfer the contents of the drive over to the other
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:21 My desktop computer had a power surge fry it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:42 I'll be building a new computer though luckily, just not any time soon rip.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:49 Wait a minute
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:51 Did you just like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:55:56 Smack it off the edge with the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:01 Or did you ram into it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:09 Rip that person
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:23 Ik i want to make a snowmobile when the winter event comes
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:33 Using those conveyors as the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:37 Just to make a nice compact one
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:52 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:56:58 You can buy hybrid hdd's
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:57:07 Ones that are a bit faster than the traditional drives
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:57:37 The only thing that harddrives have over ssd's is the fact they can literally beat any SSD in terms of lifespans
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:57:42 Atleast for now though.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:57:54 That's a bit excessive with the length lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:58:09 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:58:24 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:58:30 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:58:40 That's like the length of three tanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:58:56 Atleast they tend to y'know
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:02 Give you more of a warning when they're dying
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:13 Solid state drives can fail without any warning signs
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:24 I'd still always like to have atleast one reliable hard drive
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:27 In any computer build
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:40 Solid state drives for the os sure
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 00:59:43 And games
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:00:25 There's one thing though solid state drives can't do
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:00:47 They cant write data as many times as a hard drive would.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:00:54 Not sure when that'll change
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:00:57 Hopefully soon though.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:01:04 Because yeah i do like solid state drives but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:01:14 If your someone who does major recording like a buisness
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:01:20 Or does alot of downloading
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:01:53 Yeah that's why i said i'd still recommend having atleast one hard drive in any build if you can fit it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:00 Like they do have hybrid drives out there
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:03 That are quick
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:09 But still have the reliability of a mechanical drive
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:34 Ik one thing that i cant stand about flash storage is like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:50 I've had tons of expensive usb's and ssd's burn out for no reason.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:02:53 They'd be working one day
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:04 Then suddenly "there's something wrong with this device" = never reads ever again.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:26 Yeah but even those are prone to failure.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:33 Plus i hate to say it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:36 It's a phone.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:40 Nobody would have that much on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:42 Atleast i'd hope not
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:51 If someones packing over 1 tb of data on their phone
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:03:55 Idk what to say there
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:04:14 I mean i have a sd card in my phone with over 200 gigabytes of storage
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:04:28 But like that however, no i'd never need that much on my phone.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:04:58 Actually they're not necessarily delicate, You just need to keep in mind they have moving parts.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:05 Throwing around anything while its on would wreck it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:09 Even if you have a solid state drive.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:24 You can drop a ssd and still have a chance of it getting damaged and no longer functioning.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:49 I've actually dropped a computer with the hard drive in it and the hard drive was still going strong for another 8 years
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:54 Before slowing down to nearly a halt
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:05:58 Still works even after that
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:21 Why would you even do that anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:31 It wasn't a laptop lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:36 It was a desktop computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:41 It got dropped out of a moving truck.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:43 Right onto the road
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:06:48 Completly busted the case
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:07:22 Well yes but anyone who drops a computer while it's on honestly doesn't deserve to have one.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:07:32 If i caught someone walking around with a laptop and just casually you know
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:07:36 dropped it while they were using it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:07:44 I'd be thinking what the hell is wrong with that person
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:05 Ok that's just stupid
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:12 If i was to do that with my computer i bet it'd "hate me"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:26 The weight of the computer would likely wreak havoc on the hinges.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:36 Atleast on mine it would
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:47 Speaking of holding laptops by the screen
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:08:53 At my old highschool
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:01 Someone broke my "school laptop"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:03 By doing that.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:08 Literally took a chunk out of the back of it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:14 And they tried to pin it on me
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:19 Because they didn't sign it out first
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:27 So as far as they were concerned i had the computer.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:41 That computer was dated as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:48 Old windows XP lenovo laptop
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:51 With 4 gigabytes of ram
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:09:55 And a 250 gb hdd
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:05 Couldn't even stay on for longer than an hour
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:09 Even with power saver on.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:17 You could literally turn off the wifi
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:20 And it'd still die.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:37 They were like "oh as long as it stays on for longer than 30 minutes it doesn't need to be replaced"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:49 Right so if their phone couldn't stay on for longer than 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:53 Would they not replace it?
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:10:54 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:21 Like my computer would die while working on projects
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:30 Like i'd literally be using that one cursed software
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:32 "wordperfect"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:37 Or microsoft word
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:43 And it would literally die midway through
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:46 And they never had plugs available
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:11:55 Because those stupid teens being like "no i need to charge my phone"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:01 = has like over 8 people charging their phone all at once
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:26 Oh ik one thing for sure though
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:31 If i ever went back to that highschool
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:38 I'd be knocking more than a few peoples teeth down their throat rip.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:47 I had a $40 power bank stolen
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:12:52 From the kitchen that i was working in.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:00 I got told by the teacher nobody would touch it apparently
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:19 I was busy cleaning the kitchen because the morons there didn't clean anything properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:26 And when i went to go grab my powerbank it was missing
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:31 Along with the charger block and cord.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:45 Rip that server
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:13:51 Someone got fired for that one
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:14:21 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:14:23 when your printer
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:14:25 shits itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:14:54 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:14:57 This pic is worse
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:15:00 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:15:46 Imagine how horrible that'd be
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:15:50 Witnessing that at an office building
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:15:53 And your friend's like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:15:56 "every god damn time"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:16:09 Only thought that would come to mind there is like "Wait so that happened more than once here?"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:16:21 Rip that computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:17:02 That's an fps cap unlocker right there
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:17:10 I have one on my computer too that i don't use
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:17:22 I never found a real use for it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:17:28 Aside from just messing around honestly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:23:20 Ah rip motor 2's are still broken since the recent update
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:23:40 They still lock up if they were left centered when you exit from the pilot seat rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:24:16 Pilgrim islands reborn was actually a pretty fun game back when it was still around and functioning
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:27:43 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:27:48 I found my really old build on the game
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:27:58 The owner left it so you could still load things there
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:28:03 But you cant save anything.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:28:06 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:28:09 This was my old "floating" house
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:28:21 I don't even recall the date i made that on
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:30:21 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:30:37 Honestly there's not that many good games to build on in roblox anymore.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:30:52 Plane crazy being one of the good ones
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:30:59 Sandbox yeah a bit abandoned but still not too bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:31:21 I always found build your own mech a bit irritating
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:31:32 The building system bothered me a bit
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:31:42 Build and race by louis was just destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:31:50 Some guy hacked his account when he left roblox
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:31:58 Then claimed it was him = really wasn't
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:32:06 Considering he never came back to work on the game despite claims to do so.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:32:35 The issue i always had with most building games is peoples constant urge to copy others.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:32:48 You could spend hours on something
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:32:56 And some kid would just come along
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:03 And copy all of your work in under 2 hours.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:09 Then claim your not the original builder
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:12 and that you copied them
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:13 = cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:22 Literally going through the time of trying to figure out how to make something
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:26 Then they come along and do that
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:36 I've actually done that a few times on building games before
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:46 Some game developer i know = he quit working on his game but anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:53 "tigreblood" made a new build and race at one point
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:33:56 He abandoned it but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:34:10 I had a few cars on it that were detailed on the outside
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:34:23 But underneath they were just crammed full of mechanical parts
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:34:34 I had a build that used a flywheel that was spun using thrusters to power it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:34:41 Linking to a friction differential in the back
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:34:49 I think i have a picture of it still one sec rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:35:47 It was like this on the back
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:35:48 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:36:02 And this was it later on
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:36:04 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:36:07 It actually wasn't bad at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:36:28 It's just a shame i can't even replicate that in studio rn not with my "scripting" knowledge that's relatively limited atm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:36:55 Like it could shift to reverse and well forwards
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:37:02 By switching the sides that the rollers were on
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:37:42 I built this a long time ago too
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:37:44 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:37:45 Back in 2017
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:38:01 I'd honestly love to rebuild that but trying to remake that on plane crazy would probably give me a mad headache
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:38:26 I don't really have a good picture of the back considering like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:38:36 When i did go to take a picture this little shit exploited
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:39:07 But yeah it was like a custom version of the jalopy from half life
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:39:17 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:39:22 Hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:39:34 A 2080 ti would give you better performance but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:39:57 Then again if you have a monitor that was being a bottleneck in the first place limiting how well you could see the graphics in the first place.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:40:24 This is what the original jalopy from hl2 was supposed to be
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:40:27 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:40:28 Gross
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:40:38 I like the muscle car one more honestly.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:40:54 I actually might make the attempt to build that jalopy from HL2 the muscle car one that is.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:41:28 Oh thechosenone made it before
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:41:53 This is his? hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 01:42:07 I'm triggered by the fact his doesn't have the double headlights.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:06:59 The guy that's making this was calling it a roller coaster...
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:45:25 Gotta love when someones building things that flings into your building area constantly
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:45:33 And even after i blacklisted the guy to hopefully "prevent" it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:45:38 He ends up building another stupid thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:45:43 And started shooting springs and blocks into my base.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:45:58 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:47:54 Eh he finally stopped anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 02:48:05 Started working on something more productive than trying to piss off everyone apparently.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 03:41:18 I'm remaking a build i did on another game back in 2017 on plane crazy rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 03:41:38 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 03:41:53 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:11:25 ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:11:46 Oh i'll be putting an oversized double wishbone suspension system in the front
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:11:51 And an axle one in the rear
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:12:03 It had a 3 link on the one i built before
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:12:12 Even though it was destroyed thanks to well, "Exploiters"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:12:34 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:12:36 It's the jalopy from half life 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:12:44 Or atleast mine being a modified one
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:13:11 With a different muscle car but generally sticking to the original.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:13:24 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:13:32 That was the jalopy from half life 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:13:46 I didn't like how the jalopy from half life 2 was so err
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:13:49 "destroyed"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:14:00 I wanted one that was pretty beaten up sure like missing body panels
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:14:09 Just looked a bit more like someone actually tried to use it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:14:16 Instead of fixing it enough to drive and that was it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:50:12 I got asked something cursed by someone
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:50:22 They legit looked at my builds air intake on the engine
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:50:26 and asked if it was a spare tire...
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:50:48 Yeah like my spare tire guys
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:50:54 I keep it above the engine to keep it nice and warm for when i need it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:51:24 Honestly at this point i could actually get a few ranks but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:51:27 I don't even bother rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:51:44 I atleast qualify for about 3 of them considering all the random stuff i've been making
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:51:52 But yeah idk, it's just "too much work" Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:24 I just saved my recent progress on my build and well
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:25 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:27 Yay.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:35 I'm curious as to if thats going to be red when im done
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:41 Because i still haven't finished the rear suspension yet
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:52 I literally just started on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:52:58 psst
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:53:03 an anime a day keeps the real girls away
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 04:53:17 = bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:24:31 Well my build sorta drives
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:24:34 Gonna have to stiffen the rear suspension more though
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:25:06 Y'know whats triggering
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:25:12 When your sitting at your desk late at night
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:25:19 and suddenly a mosquito is in your room
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:25:21 flying around
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:28:54 I had a bunch of ants in my room once
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:28:58 Basement room issues much
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:01 But anyways yeah i just uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:07 Flooded them with raid
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:16 They came up from one of the trims in the corner of my room
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:22 So i just literally drenched that area in raid
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:25 They never came back.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:47 My friend's a bit crazy when it comes to using raid though
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:29:51 He literally sprays flies with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:11 Y'know what you need to do
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:20 Make an electric fence powered by a 9 volt battery
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:23 A tiny one
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:26 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:26 right near where they come in
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:30:33 So they'll go try to climb out and get fried
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:31:00 "internally screaming"
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 05:31:10 Nah i just finished the rear suspension and noticed that
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:04:37 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:04:39 I just realized
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:04:43 Im in your server 224jay
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:06:03 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:06:04 Rip your ship
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:06:34 Eh it's not too bad.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:07:47 Rip.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:07:47 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:07:55 Big fat rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:08:08 I could get a higher fps if i decided to turn down the graphics but nah, im good
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:04:07 y'know
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:04:15 like how the "motors" aren't fixed yet
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:04:17 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:05:15 This entire mess is going on in my custom jalopy
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:06:08 I remember it actually, because i tried using it and that just didn't work at all.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:06:21 I was trying to use it to make a working door lock :/
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:07:01 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:07:07 It was more like some deadbolt almost
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:07:28 Using the motor to force a rod to fit into a slot in the doorframe to lock it
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:07:32 It worked a bit sure but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:07:37 The mechanism would break under heavy stress.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:09:26 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:09:44 I'm not even sure what to call this rear suspension
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:09:54 It's literally just been added onto a fair bit now
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:10:15 Those springs facing the sides are controlling how much the axle can pivot, acting almost like a anti bodyroll system
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 07:10:33 That's a sick shelby though
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:18:45 Look at this "beautiful" truck
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:18:48 
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:18:49 rice rice baby
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:17 That moment when your using dial up internet in 2019
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:21 So roblox takes a few days to update
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:32 "It'll only take a minute"
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:37 3 days later "it's done"
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:46 Takes another day just to join a game
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:23:50 Then another 4 days to spawn in
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 02:36:58 Me and my friend were just ricing out our trucks rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 04:13:05 What if someone made a version of russian roulette on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 04:13:08 With 4 seats
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 04:13:16 And having some magnet thats spinning in the center
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 04:13:24 And if it hits someone it'll just "yeet" them off the map
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 04:13:52 A bit of a less barbaric one
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:06:01 I got bored and built some tiny atv to fit in my small truck
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:06:44 It doesn't actually fit in the truckbed properly though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:07:18 Also another big fat rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:07:23 Its tailgate doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:07:29 = Im gonna be spending a bit of time to try to make that work though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:07:31 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:07:49 So for now the thing gets driven over the edge, a bit of a cringe way of getting an atv out of a trucks truckbed
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:16:18 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:16:39 I trimmed down its wheel wells in the truckbed area so it fits a bit better now
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 05:16:48 Yea
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:43:15 I was just thinking about somethin, I would of totally put my flying bike in the creations channel but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:43:22 It has so little parts it doesn't qualify for anything
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:43:26 Literally 67 parts
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:43:32 Still looks sick as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:43:42 So many noobs on plane crazy tried to copy it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:44:08 One sec
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:44:41 
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:45:01 
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:45:04 It was this lmfao
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:45:46 My friend said he wouldn't copy it because of the tiny flaw it has
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:45:53 Only a single flaw in the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:46:03 It literally shakes around a slight bit when its going over 600
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:47:33 I got asked by someone last night as to why i don't post my builds in creations to get ranks, It's for more than a few reasons.
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:47:38 There's literally 2 year olds here
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:47:41 Who downvote every single thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:47:44 Regardless of what it is
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:47:58 I wonder if they're even recognized at this point though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:48:19 Like i could literally post something with well over 1k parts that's detailed and they'd still downvote it immediately as they go around downvoting everything else they see lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:48:34 Speaking of that
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:48:38 I finished my massive jalopy build
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:48:48 = It gets targeted by people like mad now though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:49:12 
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:49:27 I'm thinking of altering the bodypaint color a bit though to make it a bit darker
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:49:47 It's actually a rebuild of a car i made on a different game on roblox years ago though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:50:22 This was the original one i made back in 2017
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:50:24 
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:50:45 Kinda wish we had more blocks though on plane crazy ngl.
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:51:03 I don't get why we have wedges of wedge x1,x2,x3,x4 but not half wedges of those.
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:51:17 I would of loved to have half wedges longer than 2 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:51:24 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:53:19 Some guy pretty much just started a war with me, i think he's already regretting it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:53:32 Literally flew his block spammed bomber "thing" into the side of my vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:53:46 So i just darted at him with my plane using its conveyor motor just to yeet him off the map
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:53:57 Literally smacked into him going over 3k
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:54:22 Only triggering part is i noticed the motors that control the wings on my plane don't actually hold together at that speed lmfao
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:54:32 They literally glitch right out
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:54:38 Regardless of if i slow it down or not
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:54:45 I'm sure i can probably find a workaround though
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:55:05 hence the fact i just said "probably" likely won't even work whatever im gonna try to do
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:59:49 Well i found out one triggering thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 13:59:56 Even if i stabilize those wing motors on my plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:01 The landing gear will still explode itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:22 I'm surprised when the landing gear is folded up that the landing gears wheels don't just lock
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:40 Wait what even is that
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:43 Ik its a ship but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:53 Atleast i think its one
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:00:59 Kinda looks like its got a mouth
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:01:00 XD
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:01:22 I wonder what a gravity cannon does underwater
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:01:32 yeets the water at someone with the strength of a thousand earths gravity?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:03:06 Yeah that looks sick
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:03:15 So it all folds up hiding away inside
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:04:08 I'm gonna make some deadass startrek ref
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:04:22 So should we just say anything that goes over 1k is warp one, 2k is warp 2, etc lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:05:41 I still find it hilarious how i have like over 8 different car builds in studio that i spent hours on
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:05:45 But never bothered to make them a chassis
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:05:55 They're still sitting in my saves somewhere with no wheels at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:02 Or they do have wheels but there's not even a god damn frame under it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:08 big fat rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:41 If im thinking about that correctly then well
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:48 Those two side parts of the "gravity cannon"
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:51 fold inwards
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:06:56 Then it just lifts up inside the hull
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:07:27 That's nothing compared to what i made on build and race a few years ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:07:41 Massive water inlets that would of literally murdered hundreds of fish
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:07:43 as it goes along
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:08:05 And it was routing the waterflow throughout the inside of the submarines hull out to the back
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:08:15 And it turned by tilting panels on the sides redirecting it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:08:27 = That thing would of been a real mess to put in the damn ocean right there
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:09:00 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:07:25 I love roblox's new catalog title
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:07:27 "avatar shop"
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:07:46 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:07:48 Oh rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:07:58 Yeah i'll just let him go rage at someone else
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:08:07 But yeah honestly though, not even surprised
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:08:18 Also, plane crazy's motors going a high speed? = bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:08:28 I literally exploded an entire aircraft by flying it over 8k
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:08:31 Because the landing gear imploded
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:08:38 And then the wings just popped off.
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 03:28:21 Rolling coal much
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:35:20 Idk what to even say about what i just did
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:35:23 
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:35:28 I literally just built that in under 30 minutes out of boredom alone
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:35:35 Some little "kei" truck almost
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:35:46 I had to literally cut out the front a bit just because the wheel kept colliding with everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:36:08 Also uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:36:17 What's the "collision" option for wheels anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:36:26 Not sure if anyone knows or not, I just don't use those wheels often at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:37:12 It was still colliding either way though
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:37:13 XD
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:54:31 My tiny truck only has 100 parts
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:54:42 It's kinda funny ngl
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:54:57 
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:55:04 I just redid the suspension again
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 09:55:17 Since i realized yeah i could attach its springs to the wheel blocks themselves, kinda helped
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 04:22:15 It's a little early but im already building a massive snowmobile lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 04:22:36 = watch as the winter update never comes then that thing never gets used
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 04:23:18 Ah if that happens maybe i'll just do this
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 04:23:30 slap some wheels on it in place of the ski's = good to go
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 04:23:33 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 05:53:51 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 05:53:57 My "snowmobile" works
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 05:54:14 I had to put conveyors in the front ski's in the center just to let it steer properly.
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 05:54:24 Because the ski's kept being forced to slide across the ground....
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 19:36:25 ha
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 19:36:41 Ps, the voice chat still functions.
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 19:37:19 The voice chat still works by the way.
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 19:41:19 This is why, have fun with that "knowledge" k.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:08:02 Any thoughts on my snowmobile? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:08:06 Aside from the fact its not on snow cause no snow yet k
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:09:10 ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:09:13 What thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:09:23 The ski's?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:09:57 Did you limit how much the ski's themselves could pivot?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:10:21 Oh y'know what i did to solve that issue lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:10:31 Those pieces in the middle of the ski's are actually conveyors
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:10:36 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:10:46 I don't even find any humor in that so
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:10:50 gj trying
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:11:08 Anyways yeah i use conveyors on the front ski's in the center that way they can actually affect the direction it turns.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:11:25 Otherwise i would of had to put wheels there.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:13:03 Conveyor "engines" literally love to blow things up though i swear.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:13:18 Second it goes over 2k its just like the end of everything, It'll explode.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 03:18:39 Ew lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:54:57 This was too cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:55:06 I literally just perfectly landed my small flying bike into my friends plane while he was building it
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:56:32 You literally sound like a depressed 12th grader realizing he didn't study for the exams and he only has a day left
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:58:55 Rip.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:59:24 Yeah a half inner wedge would of been nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:01 Coolracer
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:05 Y'know why they lock up
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:22 It's because if you leave them in their starting position when exiting from the pilots seat
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:27 they'll immediately lock up and stop working.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:43 = stupid bug that apaprently is too complex to find out.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:53 I've literally explained it before and kept getting asked for more information on it...
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:12:01 Even though that bug can be replicated in under 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:07:27 Anyone have any thoughts on my truck i built in under two hours? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:07:36 Also yeah i didn't really like that one map with all the uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:07:40 extended islands
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:07:53 It just feels like it would be annoying to get to them all
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:08:05 Also they looked tiny, not sure if they were bigger up close or not
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 21:08:06 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:14:53 I just got my quick built military truck's hood working lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:14:57 Took a bit rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:15:28 
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:15:44 
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:15:48 It was a bit irritating to try to make it close properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:16:01 "mom said its my turn on the xbox"
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:16:37 Any thoughts on my quick built jeep thing? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:16:46 It was modeled after a willys jeep but of course it isn't actually one, It was changed around a bit
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:17:16 
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:17:29 Those cutouts in the hood sadly were necessary rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:17:35 Otherwise those servos would of welded right to it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:17:54 Yeah but that thing wouldn't even get me a rank at all.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:17:57 246 parts.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:18:05 Neither would my others.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:19:00 This was the truck i built previous to that jeep
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:19:15 Had to have some smaller military vehicle to go with it i guess.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:25:09 Hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:25:28 If you could actually simulate real tank tracks on plane crazy without lag i totally would of been like make a ripsaw it'll be great
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:25:39 But y'know, either it's gonna lag like hell or its going to be far too easy to break.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:25:49 Or worse it's gonna just work like garbage.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:26:02 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:26:12 My snowmobile works well a bit sure but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:26:19 There's only one thing i have an issue with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:26:27 The conveyors i used instead of tracks to keep the scale down well
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:26:36 They have instant torque.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:27:33 That moment when you tesla swap a smart car
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:27:44 That's just a crash test photo k
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:27:46 But anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:28:00 Imagine making a smart car on plane crazy? Yeah i can't even imagine that it's just too cursed
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:28:01 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:28:12 I can picture someone making a gigantic smart car though
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:28:43 I might post my jalopy in creations though idk
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:29:07 1541 parts on it rn
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:29:20 
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:29:43 Ik how to make a self driving car k
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:29:46 But its not smart at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:29:53 It just drives and crashes into things doesn't steer either.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:30:00 = leaves the motor going
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:30:11 Just hold w when you exit the seat
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:30:14 there you go, self driving car
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:30:15 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:31:01 There's one thing i honestly hate about my jalopy build though
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:31:05 Its taillights honestly bother me
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:31:18 Because the original one i built on another building game a while back were much more detailed obiviously.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:31:28 
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:31:31 They should be a little bit thinner.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:32:14 Oh that won't help much in that things case honestly.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:32:26 Because then i'll have a tail light that'll look too recessed in.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:32:45 Or i'll lose the entire shape of the tail light too
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:33:47 This is a bad picture since some kid literally exploited the game i built it on when i took the pic rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:34:08 That lil 3.0 moron exploited it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:34:14 But like yeah that was the back of the car i originally made
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:34:17 It was built back in 2017
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:39:05 Eh it was build and race at one point, Now it's just gone from roblox lol.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:39:12 The game developer who was working on it abandoned it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:39:16 And shut the game down for good since
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 03:39:31 It was made by joosai/tigreblood
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:03:36 This right here is a big rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:03:38 
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:03:41 Idk what the hell happened there
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:03:46 I was getting a solid 60 fps then like
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:03:58 Some kid joined my server as i was flying my plane far off in the distance
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 13:04:05 And the fps just started dropping like mad
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:21:58 I am honestly so glad this discord server doesn't have the same bot as the other server im in rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:09 I got muted on another server then my friend had to unmute me because i asked someone how old their computer was.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:16 It was their dyno premium bot that did it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:24 It assumed i was asking someone how old they were
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:29 Even though i was talking about a computer.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:41 Literally gave me no warning messages either
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:46 It just automatically deleted it
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:22:56 Then when i went to say it again because i thought maybe the message didn't send = muted
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 16:06:34 Someone needs to build this
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 16:07:15 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:27:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:27:52 Just to think
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:28:00 I'm making people think im a noob with my no roles going on
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:28:22 Nah it's more like i just can't be bothered to try to get any roles lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:28:45 Gotta love how you gotta specifically request it now in a seperate channel
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:28:49 I have a car with over 1,700 parts
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:28:53 = that giant charger.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:29:12 Also roblox's new leaderboard is disgusting.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:29:30 Whatever, it's still gross lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:29:41 I wouldn't mind too much if it wasn't so y'know
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:29:43 "thick"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:29:50 and looking like a dark blob in the corner of my screen.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:37:36 Some guy got mad at me for blacklisting him on plane crazy kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:37:49 He was shooting a bunch of blocks that kept rolling into my base
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:38:01 And was like "if you don't unblock me your gonna die"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:42:17 That wheelie though
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:42:30 My friend dropped something on the top of my car and as it was driving it started doing a massive wheelie
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:42:35 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:43:02 His so called "mystery box" amazon package drone
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:43:06 That thing is just loaded full of explosives
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:43:54 That'd be terrifying as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:44:07 Having some amazon drone fly and drop some mysterious package off to your house
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:44:31 Not even ordering it
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:44:40 Just living alone and some random drone just drops off an unlabeled package
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:56:17 That's just great
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:56:29 I wonder how many people stopped using rover since
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:56:51 Also just curious so like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:57:02 To get a rank do you have to post in creations? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 01:57:32 I wouldn't be surprised if that one guy who downvoted my builds every single time would just end up coming back out of nowhere to do it again
creations-chat 2019-12-12 01:59:32 This is my custom jalopy build
creations-chat 2019-12-12 01:59:54 
creations-chat 2019-12-12 01:59:58 
creations-chat 2019-12-12 02:01:00 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:02:10 Lol creativ did you just say what is this to the new leaderboard?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:30 Oh that?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:35 It's roblox premium
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:55 Oh that
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:57 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:58 playerlist
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:03:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:05 People usually hide it but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:10 I was in my vip server so i saw no need
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:37 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:39 I just saw something cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:41 Look behind my name
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:44 See that saying
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:46 "button"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:04:50 Lmao roblox failed
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:23 Oh i started getting that when i went back on roblox again
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:27 Also
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:27 Ended up getting an update
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:32 Roblox apparently enabled the new grass now
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:44 It's not turned on in plane crazy yet though rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:05:52 Everyone was like "the grass is going to cause major lag"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:06:04 If anything, I'm mad it doesn't even put a dent in my fps on max graphics.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:06:14 And it doesn't render far enough on max graphics
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:06:16 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:06:48 I do want to try to get a rank with that jalopy build but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:06:53 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:07:07 I don't like the idea of having to ping a mod for it lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:07:33 Because on most servers im on you end up pinging a mod then they're like "did you just ping me" = ends up getting a warning for it
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:08:16 One build i definitely aint gonna post in creations though
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:08:27 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:08:36 I'm honestly not too happy with how it turned out
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:08:57 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:09:02 My computer is just trying to get on my nerves i swear
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:09:10 It keeps muting the audio for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:09:18 Then i have to unmute it again
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:09:25 It's like my keyboard's mute hotkey is acting up rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:03 Ik the mute hotkey on my computer needs two keys to be pressed in order to do it so like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:05 I have no clue.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:13 It's also been doing another really irritating thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:16 It'll mute every single window
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:24 And unmuting the audio as a whole won't do anything
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:10:35 I end up having to go into volume mixer and unmuting it all again
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:11:48 Honestly though this is like the only problem with that car i did
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:11:50 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:11:53 This stupid section
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:11:56 I wanted to use half blocks there
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:12:09 But of course, that middle portion wouldn't be attached properly if i did.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:13:05 I fixed my massive suspension chassis too
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:13:20 It was having issues before with the steering because the motor2 wanted to act like it was being "abused"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:13:53 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:13:58 Basically there's like 4 servos on mine and it kept doing some really stupid thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:14:09 Where it'd lock up for no reason and start twitching
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:16:52 I didn't even pay attention to that but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:17:04 What even is the letters in the roles for?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:17:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:17:09 Also
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:17:16 Yeah i think they work on land still technically because like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:17:23 They're nothing more than adjustable mass blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:18:22 I literally don't even recall choosing those but alright lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:18:32 I'm just like trying to figure out this one thing so uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:18:47 When you go to try and get a rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:18:57 Do you just ping one mod? or all? lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:19:08 I thought so
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:19:54 Imagine pinging rick to get a rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:20:02 = gets the muted rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:20:04 finally suceeded
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:21:06 Do you guys like my snowmobile im gonna use in the winter update? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:21:47 Eh, it would just be weird not to use them at all honestly
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:21:54 Also kinda helps it go over hills a bit still
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:22:16 You forget that like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:22:23 In studio you can change a material all at once on terrain
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:22:30 You can literally just replace terrain
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:22:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:23:31 What doesn't work?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:24:32 I like the new creator icon on the leaderboard, lil bob the builder hammer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:24:34 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:25:18 Roblox's grass render distance is triggering
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:26:43 Imagine if roblox actually updated their water terrain
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:26:50 To give it the appearance of the water being displaced by things
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:27:10 That ground plane though
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:27:19 Taking off in.... Never
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:34:56 You didn't know about that?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:34:57 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:00 I do that all the time man
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:08 Just because on the game i moderate kids literally are like "oh no a mod"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:13 So i go on my alt and just sneakily record them
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:21 Then i end up hopping on my main and whip out the ban hammer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:37 Looks like i cant run that game
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:38 big rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:41 Jk
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:55 has i3 integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:35:59 with a cpu clocked at 1.5 ghz
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:06 and 4 gigabytes of ram
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:10 JK
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:14 If someone legit was playing roblox on that
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:16 I'd be like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:30 "you cant say anything about a game needing to have lag reduction done"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:36 Because their computer would be trash so bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:41 Dude my desktop computer from 2009
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:43 Was like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:47 But it ran roblox better
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:48 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:52 It actually beat my friends computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:36:58 Even though it had a dual core pentium processor
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:37:04 Clocked at 2.5 ghz
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:37:11 With 4 gigabytes of ram
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:37:16 Using integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:37:21 Yet beat my friends 2016 computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:37:47 That desktop computer nearly met a sad fate
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:00 But i gave it to my brothers friend, He's using it now lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:09 Yes i can do that too
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:11 lemme just
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:12 flex rq
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:24 Gotta open up that windows 10 app too andddd
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:38:25 ye
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:39:02 nice horn
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:39:14 That moment when your flying your plane around and all you hear is another plane honk at you
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:39:47 I could of bought an hp netbook thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:39:51 For over 1000
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:39:59 And it wouldn't even get close to beating my gaming laptop from 2017.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:40:46 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:40:47 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:41:15 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:41:20 reee
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:42:01 You mean flying carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:42:10 Also
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:42:16 Nice curves on the hull
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:42:18 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:43:39 See this is with two things loaded in still = My alt just has some destructible wall for me to test random crap on
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:43:52 Mostly just so i can shoot stuff at it honestly
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:44:09 I wonder, imma go uncap my fps rq just for jokes
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:45:20 It might be possible to do that
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:45:23 If you well uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:45:30 run a virtual machine?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:45:33 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:45:57 Imagine 900 instances of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:00 On a server computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:05 Just to see what would happen
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:22 All you'd hear is the equivalent of a jet engine as the server is trying to stay cool
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:42 You should hear my gaming laptop on fallout 4
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:48 Sounds like a literal jet engine
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:46:59 Just some high pitched fan noise pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:47:19 Still my mic wont pick it up but its loud enough to be annoying without music playing yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:48:32 The back vents on my computer are like this
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:48:38 I got triggered with some video i saw online because like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:48:44 I saw two 7-8 year olds
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:48:46 Playing on one
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:48:56 And it's like so uh, who the hell gave these little kids a gaming computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:49:04 I would never give a kid that young a gaming computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:49:20 Maybe if it was like you know, a setup that they cant touch?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:49:29 A desktop computer perhaps? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:49:34 Locked in a cabinet so they cant fiddle with it?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:50:46 Mostly because y'know
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:50:53 nasa's computers are for computing data
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:50:55 Not games
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:51:19 They don't exactly y'know
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:51:22 have gaming graphics cards
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:01 You cant play games on a quantum computer but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:06 Yeah if they could it'd likely be quick.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:20 They're way of computing data isn't the same as a normal computer making it impossible
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:35 Ah the day we get home quantum computers
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:45 = that's the day we'll get sentient ai's in our household
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:46 JK
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:48 Imagine that
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:52:58 Your wife decides to cheat on you
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:02 so you cheat on her with an ai instead
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:09 "Atleast she's smart"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:15 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:31 I really hope someone does that in the future even though i won't live to see sentient ai's i don't think
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:32 XD
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:48 Cheats on their wife with a toaster
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:53:55 "At least the toaster makes me breakfast"
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:54:18 Yea
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:55:12 That moment when your in a discord server, it's all quiet then all of a sudden
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:55:16 Like 10 noobs pop in
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:55:25 start spam pinging everyone
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:55:47 That's horrible
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:55:53 That guy is a literal moron
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:56:33 = tests chloroform on himself and thinks it doesn't work then suddenly "Wham" hits his head
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:56:51 -10
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:56:58 Jk
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:57:07 6?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 02:57:33 Does the wings fold up or something on it?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:45:26 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:45:43 My friend showed me my false mute thing on another discord server and look
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:45:46 
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:45:49 This is what happened to me on another server
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:45:55 I can't even
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:08 It's just too cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:10 Btw
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:15 Yes ik that player list triggers me bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:19 It should be like in the top right corner
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:22 In the actual corner
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:25 Not offset from it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:39 Plus its transparency should be the same as the top bar
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 05:46:58 That way it all mixes well together rather than having some darker player list than the rest of the gui.
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:05:47 My friend tried to flex on me with his "vertical takeoff" plane even though he did the vertical takeoff the noob way
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:06:00 Using rockets to make it fly up.
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:19:03 👀
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:43:25 Like my oversized drift chassis's steering angle? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:44:58 Dang i like that police car build in creations
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:45:08 I kinda want to know if my jalopy is the same scale or not though
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:47:41 That moment when you casually just downvote every single build you spot in creations
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 03:48:00 and just upvote every copied, crude build you spot
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 01:43:51 That's nothing
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 01:43:56 I had someone send me an invite to some uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 01:44:03 non family friendly server
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 01:44:19 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 19:58:37 I got a snowmobile too
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 19:59:31 Oh i cheated a bit to let it turn
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 19:59:52 I just stuck conveyors in the center of the front skis to give it something to grip properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:00:07 Because otherwise it would of just pushed the skis around and the skis wouldn't be able to guide it what so ever.
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:08:17 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:08:33 Then again mine is massive in scale compared to yours, Probably explains why
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:09:30 
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:09:49 They're mounted in the center of the ski's and drive at the same speed as the rear conveyors do
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:09:56 That way it'll actually steer properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:10:02 I could of used wheels and that would of worked too but like
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:10:11 It would of just been really weird to put wheels in the center of ski's.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 20:59:25 I found some modern artwork on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 20:59:28 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 20:59:43 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 20:59:44 Nice name
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:04:31 Does anyone know what this thing even is?
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:04:34 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:04:50 Idk what the thing even is, some dude is just building it but he doesn't talk either
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:07:03 I really wish we could also make it so the people we blacklist that we'd have an option to hide their builds from being seen
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:07:11 Yeah i did that on plague inc a few times
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:07:33 Just give it the ability to spread but no negative side effects, so they'll never know its there or cure it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:07:46 Then once the whole world is infected, start giving it the most deadly side effects
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:08:16 That would literally be the mind of a sentient virus right there
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:18 I noticed something kinda bad-ish about the tablet me and my mother got for my younger brother on christmas
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:27 It's a samsung tablet that turned out to actually be one with a pen for it
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:35 Didn't even say anything about it having one and it was well hidden
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:39 Nah the thing is there
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:47 But my younger brother will likely lose it knowing him.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:09:57 Nah it was literally like hidden in the bezel of the frame
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:10:32 If i knew it was that kind of tablet i would of honestly bought it for myself lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:11:28 I speedbuilt some trophy truck on plane crazy yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:11:39 Ngl if i built it at a larger scale it would of turned out better
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:11:52 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:12:06 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:13:01 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:13:21 11 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:16:01 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:16:43 If there was wheels slightly bigger than 3x3 i would of
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:16:53 But y'know, it's scale doesn't exactly fit well with 5x5 wheels.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:17:19 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:17:26 That's what it would of been like
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:17:29 If it had "5x5" wheels.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:17:49 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:17:58 Still looks too big for it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:18:40 Shame we don't have 4x4 cylinders though
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:18:48 I'm not throwing 5x5 wheels on it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:19:20 They'd literally make it look like some mental "donk" car if 5x5's were used.
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:20:05 Sorry but i picture this shit
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:20:10 When i think of my truck having 5x5 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:20:23 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:20:55 Well hopefully the suspension will compensate for the bumpy ass wheels
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:21:29 Crap im gonna have to do the equivalent of "portal axles" to fit these wheels
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:22:16 This is my oversized suspension chassis lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:22:29 Literally built the thing to be the equivalent of an oversized drift car
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:22:38 Also nice build hankwilliams
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:23:06 
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:23:12 Got my overkill steering angle on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:23:22 But yeah it drifts like some oversized go kart pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:23:31 Mhm
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:24:31 You could make it spawn in anchored
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:24:40 then unfold itself and unanchor it
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 21:24:51 Assuming it'll fit on the tracks in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:06:55 Needs some cardboard fender flares
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:07:52 I managed to cut out almost 500 blocks from my massive jalopy build i built almost a month ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:08:02 Kinda made it a bit less of a laggy mess to drive around
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:08:29 When you nearly have 2k parts just bouncing around on mechanical suspension it never exactly goes well for anythings physics lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:08:37 I literally exploded peoples things just by driving near it with that damn thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:09:29 I get people saying this to me nearly every time they see it
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:09:38 "Nice mad max car"
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:09:43 It's not even from mad max though?
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:09:59 Eh guess it just shows how little people even played half life before though
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:10:05 Its this
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:10:21 And this was the car from half life
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:13:03 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:13:13 Look what i made earlier in under 20 minutes out of boredom
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:13:23 
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:13:27 I both hate it and like it at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:13:42 
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:15:09 It's like some crude small pagani zonda cinque
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 11:16:55 Found your server
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:23:52 I unintentionally made a cannon?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:24:06 I was bored messing around with mechanisms and ended up making something that can shoot 3x3 balls
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:25:02 It was just this
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:25:02 
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:25:12 Some weird mechanism that ended up squeezing the ball in the center shooting it upwards
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 03:25:29 It wasn't even meant to shoot anything i just wanted to see what would happen if i dropped a ball in it then it ended up doing that.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:33:19 Some kid is being real cringe on plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:33:27 Tryna say that anyone who builds cars on plane crazy is bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:33:39 And that they are "stuck on land" for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:33:41 I don't get it
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:33:50 He said it takes no skill to build cars either
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:34:03 Now he's trying to prove that cars are easy, kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:34:16 
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:34:19 He's just doing this stupid shit rn
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:34:47 I was just afk and came back to the kid roasting me and my friend out of nowhere for having cars
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:37:05 I literally tried to explain to the kid though
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:37:14 That just because you can build cars one way doesn't mean thats the only way
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:37:23 There's easy ways to make planes and cars on plane crazy with barely any skill.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:37:51 But if you actually spend the time you can make nearly anything complex, I personally see both planes and cars on plane crazy able to fall under both being equally difficult.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:37:56 Depending on what you do with them that is
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 05:38:22 There
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:17:41 Back in highschool i used to literally get like 3-4 hours of sleep every night
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:17:54 Then stayed awake all day by drinking an excessive amount of coffee
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:18:01 And like literally as soon as i got home i'd go crash in bed or somethin
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:18:16 Nice ship
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:22:41 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:22:49 I've just been giving myself a headache with this monstrosity
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:22:53 
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:23:08 
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:23:18 The suspension system for the front extends out throughout the middle of it
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:23:57 It's rear engined but i couldn't be bothered to build an engine in it anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:23:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:24:36 Also yes i literally had to put holes in the hood just for the suspension to work properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:24:43 That's sorta what happens when you get the steering servos too high.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:24:57 I really wish there was some way to actually get the servo right next to the wheel without it welding to it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:25:06 So either you get stuck with a few bad situations
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:25:17 You put the servo too far from the wheel and get trash steering
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:25:35 Or you put it too high up and end up having to deal with the fact you have barely any room to do anything rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:25:58 Honestly that car was just supposed to be a normal supercar build but then i got sick of it being incapable of offroad
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 08:26:03 Then i just did that to it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:44:59 I'm gonna try to do something cursed-ish with my cannon thing i made
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:46:38 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:46:54 I gotta find a way to load 3x3 spheres into the cannon, It's messed
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:47:46 It's just this thing, turned out to work pretty decently as a cannon so im just gonna turn it into one
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:48:11 
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:51:29 It just squeezes the 3x3 sphere forcing it to shoot out
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 19:51:53 A bit like one of those old toys that would shoot marbles
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:29:29 Well... The "cannon" works but my god its ugly
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:29:37 Literally looks like a god damn tennis ball shooter
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:30:07 Yeah but instead of shooting tennis balls its shooting cannon balls
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:30:19 It wasn't even meant to be a cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:30:22 But apparently worked as one
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:23 Ghost_TheReaper, It wasn't even meant to be anything at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:30 I just got bored and started building a mechanism on my base
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:34 Then i dropped a ball in it
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:45 It managed to actually shoot it so i tried to use it as a cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:54 Irritating part is like it does work but it always varys in how far it'll shoot
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:42:10 Sometimes it can shoot it past the ramp from the base
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:46:00 Well there is one thing people don't seem to keep in mind
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:46:07 He doesn't exactly make "bank" off the game.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:46:22 Plane crazy is more so a side project.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:46:53 And developing is already hard enough as it is, Having an army of impatient people at their backs all the time isn't exactly what i'd consider to be fun.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:26:12 Idk what to even say about this
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:39:34 Wait so
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:39:43 How would you guys even check if someones actually underage here?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:39:48 Because i mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:39:54 You can literally fake it with profile ages.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:40:03 "I'm just gonna set it to 60"
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:40:24 If you already have it set to underage obiviously you cant
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 22:40:45 But i mean if you just made an account with an age older than your own age it's one way to get around it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:27:31 I'm putting together some 2006 ford gt body for my car's chassis, Any thoughts on it so far? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:28:07 Also those are disconnectors on the back, they're for the license plate
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:28:15 I could use a sign as a license plate but eh, didn't feel like it honestly.
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:28:55 Ik, It's being built on an offroad chassis
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:20:31 for now
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:20:54 Now people know who's it is, There's gonna be a gang of trolls to downvote it probs.
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:21:04 That's a sick pelican build though
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:25:24 Eh, just something people do whenever they're bored i guess.
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:26:14 Like i get it there's going to be the occasional downvote but the fact that there's literally people who would downvote every single thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:28:02 He's referring to mine i assume.
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:28:20 As though perfect grammar is necessary, I don't even care until i get "marked" for it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:29:00 I finished this monstrosity earlier and thoughts on it? Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:30:31 I wonder how many people have built ford gt's on plane crazy, I haven't seen any 2006 ford gt builds in creations rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:30:38 One thing i don't like on it though ngl
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:30:45 The exhaust pipes placement
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:30:54 They're supposed to be lower but i didn't want to use springs to offset them
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:32:11 I still hate the doors i put on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:32:26 I didn't like the idea of not having any functional doors since it would of led to the driver getting stuck in it
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:32:39 
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:33:39 Old ford gt doors were so badly planned i swear
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:34:06 If someone didn't know much about the car they'd likely get up slamming their head off the door as soon as they get out
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:37:49 The old ford gt40 was hilarious small compared to the 2006 ford gt despite them looking quite alike
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:38:05 They literally made it too small, Someone who is 5'8 would still struggle to get into that car
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:39:59 The gt40 was built for midgets i swear
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 09:41:36 Here's a hilarious comparison between the two, the one on the left is the 2006 ford gt
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 10:01:46 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 10:02:10 Yeah that was the 2006 ford gt heritage edition
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 10:03:43 It's supposed to look like one of the old race cars, This one to be specific
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 10:16:55 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 10:16:58 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 12:14:46 I still wonder when the motor 2's issue with locking up when left at center will be fixed rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 12:17:17 Idk what to even say about this
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 12:17:31 The snow particles are just hovering there
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 12:18:08 Sparkler you mean?
plane-crazy 2020-01-04 05:35:54 I'm building some random mechanical lawnmower engine and im getting "attacked" by a bunch of random people in the process lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:45:52 Well they did ask for it.
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:46:36 I made a small differential mechanism on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:46:50 That was literally a bit of a headache to get it to actually be small enough to allow it to use cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:47:30 ?
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:47:35 Those disconnectors are linking it to the differential
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:48:47 Nah those just connect it to the gears in the differential
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:52:15 The gear gets so close to the ground though damn
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:52:31 I had to offset the gear just so the gears would mesh together properly
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:53:23 I might actually build portal axles for that differential so it won't be touching the ground
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 01:55:16 👀
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 23:02:54 👀
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 16:28:29 I find it unsettling lights on plane crazy can be this bright
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 16:28:36 That's what the guy next to my base is doing rn rip
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 00:04:58 Gotta love the noobs that do this
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 00:05:08 
plane-crazy 2020-02-03 06:57:50 I'm building some cursed truck rn
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 07:26:50 I take it there's some bug going on right now? Every time i try to use my vip server i get kicked and it just pulls up the error code 267 with an unspecified reason
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 07:26:55 But as soon as i go on a public server it's fine.
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 06:05:29 👀
general 2020-02-12 12:17:29 I don't even know what to say about what happened here
general 2020-02-12 12:17:52 There was like a mad delay with the jetpack and i ended up getting two, then apparently found myself able to use a parachute and a jetpack...
general 2020-02-12 12:17:54 Sounds safe
general 2020-02-12 12:18:13 Very_Noobdude, Care to start a toxic argument here and now?
general 2020-02-12 12:18:15 Because how the f'k
general 2020-02-12 12:18:21 would you know what others would think
general 2020-02-12 12:18:28 Also that wasn't a matter of a bad pc.
general 2020-02-12 12:18:32 That was a bug.
general 2020-02-12 12:18:43 It didn't equip a jetpack when i first clicked it, So i clicked it again and it did that.
general 2020-02-12 12:19:11 Get rid of your walmart pc kid.
general 2020-02-12 12:19:17 Before you go on dissing others.
general 2020-02-12 12:19:31 You should of learned to throw out that 32 bit piece of shit you own.
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:10:45 Has anyone made a quadski yet?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:11:09 I finished one a few hours ago i was just curious about how others done theirs if there is any other ones
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:12:36 This is how mine is, I'm not too big of a fan of how its body turned out though
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:13:08 It does fold the wheels up though like the quadski does, It's using double wishbone suspension as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:15:35 Hopefully that would fix a lot of issues
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:15:48 Like when you try to put stuff in the back of a truck on roblox and it'll just freeze the parts in place stopping the truck from moving
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:16:06 Before the only way to stop that would be having some sort of constraint attaching it to the vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:22:59 That should fix that one issue with roblox's physics but also there's another thing too
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 19:23:41 Mechanical tanks on roblox rely on having some sort of connection to the actual chassis with the tracks otherwise their tracks would come out of sync occasionally, That beta feature might actually fix that entirely
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:56:48 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:57:09 What about when you find people attempting to form a gigantic transformer out of a bunch of cars
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:57:51 I got a question, I'm pretty sure i already know the answer to it but i just want to make sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:58:08 Are people allowed to resubmit builds to get ranks?
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:58:33 Because i wanted to submit my jalopy build, It stayed about the same since aside from me doing some block reduction on it
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:59:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:59:05 Yeah but i put the build in creations back in december
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:59:20 I mean i still obviously have the car, I have no intentions of ever getting rid of it honestly
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 01:59:59 What even was the steps for getting a rank with creations though? Because i could of sworn there was some thing about you having to ping about it
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:01:31 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:01:40 I don't like pinging people ffs
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:03:09 I still didn't like how the rear turned out a bit on the jalopy because its tail lights were supposed to be up more by at least half a block but there was nothing i could do at least not at that scale without severely altering it
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:03:59 I'm not in a game rn, that was a old pic
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:04:09 But i can show you in a server if you want
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:04:37 I just don't know about me wanting to show it off in a public server too much because players have a tendency to lurk over and start thinking they get free rights to copy people when someone is trying to help a friend build the same thing
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:04:45 "Well if he can copy it why can't i"
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:05:09 Ik
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:05:21 I just mean users on plane crazy can be a bit ridiculous at times lmao
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:05:36 Steggy i'll show you a cursed military truck too lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:05:44 It's hilariously offscale and needs to get fixed
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:06:02 I'll meet you in my vip server lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:06:15 My camper? It was a small truck
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:35:06 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:35:12 Yeah i just noticed that typo
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 02:35:22 I meant to say they were supposed to be up more
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:39:13 This is totally not cursed or anything, I ruined a perfectly good snowmobile
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:57:08 This is how my snowmobile normally looks
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:57:29 I still think the build itself went well but if i made it larger i would of definitely attempted mechanical tracks on it
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:58:47 
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:58:52 I mean its conveyor tracks aren't very wide
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:59:20 If it were a bit bigger it would work
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:59:28 But the tracks themselves would have no room to move at the scale it is rn
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:59:46 
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 06:59:55 Idk who that dude is your talking about
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 07:00:07 If you mean nabees1 he is
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 09:30:37 I hate this so much
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 09:31:20 I built that out of boredom and i hate it already, didn't even have it for a hour yet
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 09:35:27 This just makes it so much better
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 09:35:36 Just gotta slap some oversized bodykit on it then it'll be tolerable.

plane-crazy 2020-02-17 20:59:12 I "finished" that tiny truck from last night, made it the worst ricer possible
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 20:59:24 
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 21:16:36 yousuf283, It's not a fire engine, more like a fire hazard
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 21:16:51 There's literally a rocket between the seats
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 21:17:07 And a massive jet engine in the back
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 03:43:51 I play it on windows 98 with a virtual machine to run roblox on
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 03:43:55 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 15:33:56 I assume your talking about ballast blocks, Yeah i've used them on land vehicles a few times
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 15:34:04 Just to offset the weight of builds when needed
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:58:16 I built some random flying thing any thoughts on this? Lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 14:04:43 It's irritating as hell to fly i'll just leave it at that
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 14:55:21 Is the new map going to have swamplands in it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 14:55:56 I was gonna say because a bunch of small interconnected islands wouldn't leave much along the lines for any land vehicles.
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 03:36:45 This looks pretty normal to me
general 2020-02-25 03:37:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:11:05 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:12:10 I built some custom 70s inspired car
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:12:49 It's got sorta a engine bay as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:13:05 
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:15:26 I almost got the trunk working but it ended up failing pretty bad
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:15:41 Because both of the pistons kept moving opposite from each other despite being both controlled by the same hotkey
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:16:11 Whenever one would go up the other would go down, It ruined the entire truck mechanism so i just left the trunk interior and just covered it back up.
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:30:22 70's Inspired car, Modeled after some old low riders
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:30:29 Shame i cant lower it any further without ruining the steering radius
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:22 ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:43 It does offroad surprisingly well, It can get around the whole map without any issues surprisingly
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:57 Aside from not being able to cross that one arch by the lab
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:34:41 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:35:07 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:35:30 Here's the engine bay
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:36:56 Just thought i'd share some compact suspension/steering design i used on my car
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:37:25 Just gotta make a quick model rq
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:38:08 
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:38:30 The delta wing is used just so it doesn't weld to the wheel and the motor can pass through it without colliding.
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:38:54 Hopefully that can be to some use to people
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:39:02 Since i saw someone ask about compact suspension before
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:39:12 It's not necessarily complex but it should help.
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:39:55 ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:40:08 I mean my car has a 50 degree steering radius
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:40:20 It's only limited on it because if it steers any further the double springs on it would hit the engine.
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:42:44 
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 17:34:26 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 17:34:38 Idk why i feel like it would be funny if there was some junkyard
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 17:34:47 With a bunch of rusted old builds just sitting there broken
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 18:13:57 Lol i bet this dude wouldn't last long on this server
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 18:14:19 He's one of those kids that takes screenshots of peoples builds then starts copying it
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 19:07:13 This totally aint cursed
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 19:09:13 I got told it looks like megaminds car before even though megaminds car doesn't look anything remotely close to it
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 20:43:55 Rip i was thinking about it, I gotta find something to replace my snowmobile now
general 2020-03-04 20:45:36 That moment when your so bad that discord has to literally warn you.
general 2020-03-04 20:46:04 That's like getting in trouble on roblox to the point roblox itself has to step up and warn you.
general 2020-03-04 20:46:13 = roblox doesn't, that's the joke.
bot-central 2020-03-05 07:32:06 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 09:21:47 Its in public servers now
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 09:22:11 You don't need to go in a testing server just to use it
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 09:22:17 It's in the propulsion tab
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 09:22:41 
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 09:22:46 When you scroll down its at the bottom
creations-chat 2020-03-06 11:34:58 Here's my custom truck, It's based on a 1942 Ford F100

creations-chat 2020-03-06 11:35:22 
creations-chat 2020-03-06 11:35:25 I hate how the back turned out
creations-chat 2020-03-06 11:41:12 The text blocks i used as handles?
creations-chat 2020-03-06 11:41:47 They're just full block unicode characters
creations-chat 2020-03-06 13:12:56 Oh i see the rail cannon, Weird
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 23:49:36 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:18:00 Rip to the poor kids who play on mobile who happen to think its a good idea to jump on one of my builds while its moving
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:18:40 Especially with those massive builds some people have
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:18:50 Some guy's just gonna spawn in some massive folding aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:18:58 And every single mobile user is gonna crash
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:19:24 Rickje and madattak better get ready to hear players raging about lag on their phones
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:23:15 more like
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 04:23:27 "GIVE ME IT NOW OR I WILL CUT OUT YOUR ENTRAILS AND FEED THEM TO MY DEATHCLAW NAMED MITTENS"
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 05:55:35 I have no idea how i survived this
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 20:36:50 Looks like one of those walkers from star wars
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 22:54:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:39:09 Bit of advice, give it some control surfaces that can tilt it
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:39:38 I have a compact flying bike that did something similar before i gave it control surfaces to tilt it
bot-central 2020-03-29 16:59:06 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:00:35 I built a rv, Any thoughts on it?
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:31 Yeah its pretty massive
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:35 It makes a extensive use of locked motors as well
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:51 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:51 
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:03:29 I originally was trying to make some old gmc motorhome but it didnt go very well
general 2020-03-30 11:08:38 Lol
general 2020-03-30 11:08:51 I've always ran into players constantly trying to get the reactor to meltdown
general 2020-03-30 11:11:08 I never witness it freeze, its always a meltdown or people running around infecting everyone
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:24:58 I'm honestly still surprised by how little upvotes my jalopy got compared to my old car i built
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:25:06 Even though the jalopy took far longer to build
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:25:50 My jalopy got i think 14 upvotes and 1 downvote
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:26:18 And my car got 27 upvotes with no downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:26:34 I feel like it was to do with the execution or something
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:26:58 Considering it took more time to figure out the mechanical side of the small car, over where the jalopy everything was sorta already planned idk
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:27:52 Your ship did look pretty nice though pyro
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:28:29 It's certainly better than what i would of done
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:28:40 Considering i can hardly build boats at all, I was always more of a car person
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:28:59 Like the only things ive ever built were land vehicles and aircrafts but aside from that, I stayed away from building boats
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:31:54 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:32:44 Damn
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:32:52 Kinda wish i got to see that ingame
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:32:55 Looks like a sick build
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:37:04 A rope engine?
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:37:12 Idk what to even say about that
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 00:09:12 <:elmo:693336953017335808>
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:49:55 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:50:01 My jalopy has 805 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:50:12 Yet it towers over my other builds with like nearly twice the block count
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:51:14 Oh i could get designer 2, didnt even notice
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:51:38 Since one of my builds got 27 upvotes and no downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:57:00 I looked at general for not even 5 seconds and just saw how toxic it got
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:57:15 Yeah i won't even touch that channel with a 10 ft long stick for the next 5-6 hours
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:57:28 Considering it looks like it became a warzone
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:58:01 I'm kinda pissed how i cant even use the text blocks for handles anymore on builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:58:12 Roblox did some dumb update to their filter so it gets censored now
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:58:22 But my older builds that used it already still load in to some extent
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:58:28 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 11:59:59 Like its not censored here
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:00:15 Thats on the other side
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:00:15 But look
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:00:19 Fun right
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:00:25 If i spam load it like 3 times
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:00:31 It'll load in just fine and no censors will be there
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:01:40 Yeah but like
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:01:47 Even then i still cant put those handles on any of my newer builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:01:51 Because it censors immediately
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:01:59 It's just some stupid filter update roblox did like a week ago
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:02:22 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:02:32 That car of mine wasnt even built too long ago actually
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:03:29 I literally built it last month
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:03:38 Ik i did finish a rv recently that went well though
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:03:47 It has no side doors because of its weird design
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:04:01 There's just one main door and that's it
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:05:09 I honestly love how in public servers if you spawn anything large players always assume its the reason for them lagging
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:09 Damn, I just realized how old my old flying bike actually is now
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:17 I think its like 5 months old now
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:19 
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:29 
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:49 It has only 67 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:40:50 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:41:03 I could of made a tutorial on how to build that but like
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:41:13 The idea of seeing over 800 players with it would bother me heavily
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:41:22 Especially considering i'd get asked by people about why theirs doesn't fly properly
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:42:05 I also have this monstrosity i built a bit recently
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:44:10 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:03 I built this truck recently but i didn't submit it
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:10 Its abusing locked motors heavily
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:21 
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:34 Not even sure what to call it honestly
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:45:43 Other than its just been based a bit off of vehicles from the fallout universe
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:47:41 There's 22 locked motors on my truck
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:47:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:47:49 Assuming i didnt miss any
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:48:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:48:49 I'm like mildly concerned why that vc is called the wind tunnel
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:49:01 I'm just picturing people blowing into their mics the whole time
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:50:21 I feel like my 1942 Ford F100 has even more locked motors though
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:50:29 Thing is i cant even count them because they're so tucked away in it rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:50:55 Damn nice
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:51:34 
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:51:36 Everything is like hidden inside that
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:51:46 Its irritating as heck to try to count them since they're all painted the same color rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:52:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:52:55 I think the underside of my truck looks pretty nice honestly
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:53:09 I've been gradually getting a bit more uh detailed with my builds lately though
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:53:16 Trying to stuff a bunch of detail into small builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:54:28 My old 1970s low rider is still one of my favorite car builds that i made
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:55:09 I'm concerned by that turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:55:28 Nice garbage bag to keep the rain out
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:55:30 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:57:07 I would join that vc but im slightly concerned by why so many people are muted in it
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:57:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 12:59:20 I kinda hate myself for doing this to my truck
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:00:49 That's so disturbing in a way
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:03:21 <:elmo:693336953017335808>
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:27:22 11/10 heat shielding right here
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:27:34 The only thing that covers that engine is a wooden center console
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:29:25 
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:29:28 That's all there is covering it
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:29:29 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 13:32:07 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 22:17:07 <:elmo:693336953017335808>

general 2020-04-02 22:22:10 Lol
general 2020-04-02 22:22:59 Should of been a cracked egg with a motor sticking out of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 23:01:52 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 23:02:18 I built this really unnecessary complex boat
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 23:02:29 It's got a mechanical steering system on it, It's just sitting on a stand rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 23:02:59 I built really compact double wishbone suspension before on a giant van build
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 21:31:12 I repainted my jalopy build to closer match the original one i built back in 2017
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 21:31:35 Definitely not gonna black out the headlights the original though
general 2020-04-04 21:32:51 Lol
general 2020-04-04 21:32:59 Y'know your kinda screwed now ngl
general 2020-04-04 21:33:07 If you forget your settings pincode your done
general 2020-04-04 21:33:09 Im not even kidding
general 2020-04-04 21:33:14 I never forgot mine luckily but like
general 2020-04-04 21:33:17 You literally cant change it
general 2020-04-04 21:33:36 You might be able to contact customer support though if anything
general 2020-04-04 21:33:40 = assuming you can even get ahold of them
general 2020-04-04 21:34:18 It took them literally a few weeks to respond to my email about retrieving a old account before
general 2020-04-04 21:34:32 So needless to say unless they improved their customer support your gonna have to wait a while if you do email them lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 21:34:51 It's my own custom interpretation of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 21:35:09 Pretty plain dashboard on it though
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 21:35:18 The one i built on plane crazy has far more detail though
the-dump 2020-04-06 02:13:34 nice croissants
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 04:13:21 Well i mean you cant technically make it but like
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 04:13:50 Since torsion bars are just twisting pieces of metal you could just use a spring to add resistance to a rotating motion of a bar connected to the rest of the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 17:50:10 Wdym grounded
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:17:24 That took me like no time at all to get the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:17:32 I literally just flew my small plane into it and leaped out at it
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:10 I'm just waiting for someone to try to build that now
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:11 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:37 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:44 I think something was accidentally left unanchored
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:54 
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:58 Looks like it at least
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:19:23 Hopefully its intentional lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:19:49 But yeah easiest way to get it well
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:20:02 Just go chase it down into the building
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:24:27 fun times
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:24:28 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:24:33 That happened on the vip server
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:28:46 that moment when you realize discord is actually a browser still
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:28:57 "modified discord client" You can literally jack the entire system
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:29:05 Just by screwing with the inspect element
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:30:22 Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:30:28 Totally didnt just go on a vip server or anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:30:47 I literally got the egg within seconds, i bet thats the easiest egg in the entire egg hunt
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:31:08 Considering i literally just flew my plane up to the island, landed, then chased the flying egg down into the building and grabbed it
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:31:29 For a new player i mean they can just go build the starter plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:31:30 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:31:39 Assuming they know how to fly at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:43:35 Lol i think roblox is already having issues now from the "egg hunt"
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:43:47 I tried to join a game and it literally froze entirely at the loading screen
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:43:54 So i tried to join another game, did the exact same thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 20:49:14 <:elmostare:694672758793175121>
general 2020-04-10 07:32:30 I started rebuilding my custom truck from plane crazy in studio
general 2020-04-10 07:32:32 Lol
general 2020-04-10 07:33:17 Yeah its a remake of this one
general 2020-04-10 07:33:31 I still have more work to do on it though
general 2020-04-11 06:03:11 I just finished that truck i was rebuilding in studio
general 2020-04-11 06:03:14 Lol
general 2020-04-11 06:03:14 
general 2020-04-11 06:03:22 It has a mechanical chassis underneath built by me
general 2020-04-11 06:04:10 
general 2020-04-11 06:04:15 Some nice mechanical steering and suspension lol
general 2020-04-11 06:04:38 I got lazy with the rims though because i wasn't in the mood to make new meshes for them
general 2020-04-11 06:04:52 I guess its not too unrealistic considering most old trucks with those "hubcaps" were still just steelie rims anyways
general 2020-04-11 06:05:33 Just thought i'd share this lil pic too
general 2020-04-11 06:05:39 The one on the left was built to scale of the one i built on plane crazy
general 2020-04-11 06:05:41 Lol
general 2020-04-11 06:05:49 It literally makes the other one look like a powerwheels in comparison
general 2020-04-11 06:06:50 Cute bunny
general 2020-04-11 06:07:04 There's only one thing i don't like about bunnies
general 2020-04-11 06:07:14 The fact they can immediately turn once nice smelling room
general 2020-04-11 06:07:19 into something that smells like a barn
general 2020-04-11 06:07:21 in less than a week
general 2020-04-11 06:07:28 Even if you constantly clean their cage it'll still happen
general 2020-04-11 06:07:32 That too
general 2020-04-11 06:07:43 I remember my old pet bunny used to literally crap and pee whenever
general 2020-04-11 06:07:57 You'd be playing with it and the thing would just crap right on the floor
general 2020-04-11 06:08:03 Then proceed to run off and piss somewhere else
the-dump 2020-04-14 12:50:58 I was looking at my first badges, then i saw this on a game that i got one of my first badges on, pretty cursed lookin ngl
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:13:33 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:13:54 This sounds kinda weird ish but like a double sided motor/joint would come in handy actually
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:14:35 Or at least a uncollide plate
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:14:38 that doesn't weld to the sides
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:14:47 On a specific variant of motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:14:51 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:14:59 It would let people compact suspension even more
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:15:00 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:15:17 I already assembled one of the most compact suspension layouts so far i think quite a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:15:40 It uses a delta wing to let the motor pass through where it attaches to the servo
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:16:40 This is what i threw together a while back
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:17:02 If we get new motors i'm definitely going to try to compact it more
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:17:18 Not sure if i can but certainly won't stop me from trying to
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:18:31 I wonder if paint sprayers could even get scripted in or not though
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:20:40 Probs best to just make it only paint the owners creations
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:20:41 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:21:12 I just mean like
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:21:21 If it was added as a block that only affected your own builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:21:25 We could legit build an entire car factory
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:21:35 Making it so there could be paint sprayers painting the premade body parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:21:40 That lock onto a rolling chassis using magnets
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:11:02 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:11:13 I mean i just abused locked motors earlier on a new build i'm working on
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:11:25 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:11:36 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:11:49 I wouldn't call them useless.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:12:04 Considering a fair bit of builds use them for adding extra detail same with helping with folding builds.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:14:50 Kinda irritates me how i wanted the wheels closer to the front but i keep running into one issue that could have been avoided
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:14:55 If we had a single block type.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:15:22 A half wedge that was actually offset forward rather than back.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:15:34 That way i could keep the grill but let the wheel pass it when it steers
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:15:44 But nope, had to move the stupid wheels back by a block thanks to that rip
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:16:09 I'm aiming to try to pull off a relative amount of detail to what my lowrider had
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:17:21 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:21:47 I still have a ton of work to do on this but i think it's going well so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:22:15 Ramp?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:23:20 The bumper?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:23:34 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:25:24 I don't mind cameras but i don't like to use them if i have a choice not to.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:25:30 Considering you can literally run into it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:25:49 If it wasn't for them being collide honestly i'd likely use them.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:27:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:27:14 Look at the motor lock abuse going on with this build
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:27:24 I'm going to be overwriting it with that "land yacht" i'm working on.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:27:50 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:28:07 Only downside the hood doesn't open.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:28:40 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:29:13 Honestly i'm surprised we didn't just get like a single rocket, single jet engine etc
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:29:16 That were configurable
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:29:26 That way we wouldn't need multiple different variations for thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:29:39 Like still having different sizes of course but not needing super rockets etc.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:30:01 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:30:40 My only build that even got close was my lowrider build
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:31:02 It was this
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:31:21 I kept it though and have no intentions of getting rid of it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:31:33 Since i know i can never rebuild that car thanks to roblox's filter.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:31:49 The stupid handles get censored now on it leading to me having to reload the stupid car 50 times
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:31:52 before the handles load in
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:32:22 I swear i could go into a 24 hour discussion about why roblox is a hypocrite when it comes to their filter.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:32:45 They censor stupid things but let actual inappropriate things slip.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:33:16 I think their learning bot got dropped on its head that's probs what happened
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:33:36 The day it first came online, dropped right on its big old head
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:34:02 I guess it's not as bad as what happened on discord though with a bot
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:34:30 Some idiot in a server decided to make the word old become a "offense"
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:34:47 I literally got muted for asking someone how old their computer was when they said it was having problems
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:01 Then the second time a month later was when i mentioned about a old car.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:11 And guess what bot was responsible
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:17 Stupid degenerate dyno.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:46 It literally deleted my sentence once, no warning at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:51 So i assumed it just didn't send
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:35:58 And as soon as i repeated it = muted, still no warning
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:36:26 I'm just glad we don't have that here honestly.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:36:34 I can just picture how many people would of gotten false mutes over it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:37:06 Also, I found out something a lil bit triggering, I gotta use more locked motors on my build
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:37:16 Just to raise the side steps.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:37:32 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:37:55 I honestly haven't had any lag from ever using it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:37:59 Even when i got excessive with them
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:38:17 If that's not a thing we actually need it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:38:31 Just have every single copier plastered on the hall of shame
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:38:45 I swear that hall of shame would never end if that was the case
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:44:53 Y'know what's actually irritating though
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:44:58 As soon as you spawn your build in they can see it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:45:11 So your going to deal with a 6 year old lurking around your base waiting for you to spawn it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:45:33 And even if you leave to join another server, chances are the kid already spam screenshotted it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:11:17 I just fixed the side steps
bot-central 2020-04-29 15:16:21 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:33:59 I love how i wasn't even in a public server for long and i immediately started getting chased down by tanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:34:34 They kept trying to wedge the barrels into my jalopys rollcage
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:34:48 Honestly i don't even know any other way to word it without that sounding dirty
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:34:59 Excuse my dirty mind honestly, but yeah it was pretty bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:35:21 I just parked and before i knew it, I had those two guys chasing me down saying random stuff in some language i have no clue what it was.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:35:28 "ok"
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:35:33 Keep saying that and your going to get muted for spamming.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:35:50 It literally will count as that if you repeat it enough.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:38:39 I'll just tell you this rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:38:46 Give kids the ability to swear and they'll never stop.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:39:22 They literally will use it constantly and the toxicity will reach levels so bad no normal person would want to be here.
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:17 ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:53 On a buggy i was just building less than a hour ago it's adjustable
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:07:08 Where it can switch to a widespread firing range as well as a narrow spread
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:07:20 Not a pretty looking build though honestly
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:08:11 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:08:21 Good use of locked motors lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 03:15:03 I hated this pvp buggy build at first but i'm starting to like it a bit now that it's starting to take shape, kinda looks like some sci fi build
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 03:15:19 
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 03:15:43 The turret rises up out of it but i still have some work to do on trying to stabilize the linkage that moves it
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 03:16:21 
creations-chat 2020-05-03 05:03:07 Just thought it was about time i posted this in here considering i built it months ago and never put it in creations lol

plane-crazy 2020-05-05 21:48:20 no u
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 21:55:19 I think my car build is like immediately 10x better than most cars i seen because of one thing only
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 21:55:24 It's got two cupholders.
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 22:25:13 wow what block is that
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 22:25:19 i never seen it before
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 22:25:21 must be
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 22:25:23 fast
general 2020-05-05 23:08:36 What even
general 2020-05-05 23:08:38 
general 2020-05-05 23:08:40 What did roblox do
general 2020-05-05 23:08:48 Why do i have two
general 2020-05-05 23:17:13 Nah
general 2020-05-05 23:17:26 Its the anubis holding a flaming blue skull
general 2020-05-05 23:17:38 Or well having it levitate over its hand
general 2020-05-05 23:23:49 Just give them time, They likely got requests flooding in still since that feature was added recently to request ranks.
general 2020-05-05 23:45:51 Yep
general 2020-05-05 23:47:23 XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 23:13:59 Nice flying roomba
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 03:12:43 I was working on some ferrari f1 car, I still gotta build some linkages for the steering though rip
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 03:46:40 I like how in my server there's two people trying to copy me lmao
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 03:47:02 They're both doing like a noob version of my build, kinda makes me curious how the hell there's will turn out
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:36:23 This is lowkey the best engine ever
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:36:24 ball pit
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:36:28 gonna lose a kid in there
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:37:37 the real secret is
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:37:41 that ball pit is just to lure kids in
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:37:53 and it'll just suck them into a grinder that'll process them into fuel for the truck
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:37:58 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 04:37:59 infinite power
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:02 Totally not sketchy that i got in a updated server that had speakers and my car didn't load at all
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:19 I just went onto my vip server and it loaded just fine but apparently whatever server i got in the save was useless.
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:42:08 Adopt me will forever be hated by roblox's "slightly older" community
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:42:25 Considering it causes problems for everyone who doesn't play the disturbing game.
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:04:44 lemme just do that to all my saves rq
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:05:11 Im gonna tell someone to do that in my server rn
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:05:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:58:07 I just got engine sounds to work with my jalopy build
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:58:22 3 speaker blocks, Two varying of pitch for forward and reverse and a idle sound one.
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:58:28 Plus some other one for a startup noise.
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 02:23:10 Some guy already raged at me for talking about playing music yet he was blasting a air raid siren with 10 spammed speakers
bot-central 2020-05-14 02:25:47 !servers
general 2020-05-14 02:42:40 Vip 1 is working again lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 02:05:25 I just finished this car finally
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 02:05:58 
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 02:06:17 
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 02:06:50 It's based on the chryslus corvega atomic v8 from fallout
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 02:53:38 <:elmostare:694672758793175121>
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 15:21:39 <:elmostare:694672758793175121>
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:13:23 Just thought i'd show this so black_bird can see it lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:13:42 
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:14:38 It used thrusters connected to a flywheel to propel it, those two rollers in the friction differential would switch places to go change gears from forward and reverse
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:23:07 I finally got the hood to work properly on my corvega build
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:23:27 Not too many seams luckily
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:23:52 Opens really weirdly though
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:24:00 Not front engined anyways so i didn't care too much
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:24:39 
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:25:02 I cant get over how i wasted a hour making that hood work without interfering with the rest of the car
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:41:53 <:elmo:702613678004109312>
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:52:06 Bully them then, problem solved
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 14:04:47 I got into another cringe convo about why the speaker block being a gamepass only item is actually a good thing, cause some noobs started ranting about how it should be free
general 2020-05-18 14:30:15 <:elmo:702613678004109312>
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 13:41:02 Idk what to even say about this
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 13:41:15 That guys duck is making a ear piercing quacking sound
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:24:22 Exokay, there's not actually a gap
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:24:27 It's just clipped into the ground ever so slightly
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:25:05 I swear this is still my favorite avatar to bring onto games with r15
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:25:11 Gotta love disturbing people with that
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:39:49 I kinda like my truck more without outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:40:08 It looks more like the one i replicated in studio
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:40:47 I'll put a pic of my one from studio
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:40:55 One studio finishes updating that is
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:41:16 Why isn't there one though
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:41:21 There should have been one
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:41:50 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:42:36 This is my rebuilt truck in studio
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:42:42 Shame i cant make it like that on plane crazy though
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:44:58 That stupid forced color randomizer is a stupid idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:45:30 As far as i'm concerned if i want a build to be a certain color i want it to be that color, not some stupid sun faded color
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:47:03 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:47:17 I mean not all of us want to have our builds look like it had a $5 paint job done to it.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:47:38 Or like you just tried to paint your car with a literal paint brush.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:48:13 I do know why that idea is getting considered but i still don't like it being forced
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:48:27 I'm certain its just to replicate that stupid bug roblox had with outlines and lighting
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:48:37 Causing blocks that were all painted the same color to appear slightly different than one another
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:57:28 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:57:28 Imagine pinging for bad reasons
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:58:10 Nah i think my avatar is beautiful
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:58:13 gotta make that my pfp
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:19:32 One thing i actually like about the outlines being gone is the fact blocks are all the same color now when painted one solid color.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:19:58 Rather than looking like you just tried to paint your cars/planes with a home depot paint brush
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:20:29 I still think my truck looks nicer without outlines lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:24:22 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:24:53 I still think it looks nicer without the outlines ruining it.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:24:58 Well actually the outlines themselves didnt ruin it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:25:03 The stupid splotchy paint crap did.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:25:34 You say it looks like a toy but its still massive compared to a avatar's scale
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:25:42 I have bigger builds as well
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:26:15 The hood works on it too
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:26:16 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:26:20 I kinda wanted to remodel the engine but like
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:26:30 Using cylinders instead of half wedges on the engine just didn't look right
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:04 That splotchy paint crap bothers me with lighting
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:14 If it was a smooth transition i wouldn't care
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:22 But considering its just some sudden brick color changes alongside a whole build
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:24 It just looks weird
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:35 Yeah but its not just sudden random miscolored parts
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:27:39 Unless you got a garbage paint job
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:28:14 Yeah and it ruins the design of some builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:28:24 Considering if you want something to be a solid color, it just ruins it at times.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:28:36 The fact alone we can barely use any other materials than plastic kinda limits that too.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:29:00 I mean im not gonna lie not having it does sorta make builds look like they just popped out of a mold
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:29:47 But honestly, In my opinion, I still think that forced color randomizer shouldn't be added
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:29:51 It should be able to get toggled.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:31:50 Yeah we just need a paint tool block selection outline.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:03 I hope block reflectivity ends up getting added to the paint tool some day
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:12 Then i'd be able to actually replicate chrome parts
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:48 I don't think you understand what im talking about
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:59 Block reflectivity, the variables of it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:34:08 Yes.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:34:44 What do you think chrome does in real life?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:04 It actually adds a shine to things, and makes it reflective.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:13 What do you mean it doesn't do it to plastic
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:16 I literally do that in studio
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:18 All the time
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:36:45 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:14 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:17 Then there's .2 reflectivity.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:24 When you set it really high thats when things get "Fun"
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:39 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:38:46 You can just type in 100
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:38:48 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:38:50 Same with inf
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:39:02 Oh wait no my bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:39:07 On a game i used to play you could
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:39:25 If it did reflect other models around you imagine the lag.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:39:37 You'd need more than just some walmart pc to handle it.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:27 I like how this is
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:37 The outside of the block actually looks like its glowing
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:51 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:55 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:42:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:43:18 It would of been neat if it was actually added to the paint tool
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:43:57 That way you could set individual part reflectivity while painting
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:44:55 Yeah like how on my rv i had to use light grey blocks just to sorta give the appearance of it having chrome trim.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:50:01 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:50:11 Spitter
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 16:03:40 I broke into your engine bay earlier
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 14:08:45 I finally managed to get my different build remade
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 14:09:05 
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 14:09:26 
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 14:10:44 This was the one i made months ago
bug-reports 2020-06-02 02:46:20 Those stupid cylinders don't even roll like cylinders anymore, Good job with your stupid "improvement", You did the exact opposite of a improvement.
bot-central 2020-06-02 02:54:50 !servers
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:07:44 I don't see what's being improved there, I only see a new problem being made caused by something entirely unnecessary in the first place.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:07:56 Cylinders should roll like cylinders, Not like some preschoolers version of a circle.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:21 Try using a build with actual cylinders for wheels, It'll bounce.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:44 You likely won't notice from how heavy your build is but if you have anything that isn't heavy it's going to bounce.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:49 And the larger the cylinders the worse it gets.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:05 Literally everything that uses cylinder wheels.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:23 Cylinders got "optimized" apparently and now they're collisions aren't even that of a cylinder.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:33 More like some low poly cylinder collisions so they don't roll smoothly anymore.
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 19:46:42 This truck is taking a while rip me
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 19:47:05 It's at 659 blocks and i haven't even built the chassis or the interior yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 19:51:29 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 19:49:32 I'm getting raged at by some guy who has been trying to copy me lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 19:49:33 
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 19:49:53 
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 19:50:22 I'm just casually trying to build a vehicle to let my friend copy later and this guy is just raging at me, it's hilarious
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:11:52 My build is doing it too lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 02:17:45 
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 02:17:49 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 02:17:58 It's just the wedge block.
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:04 This is a weird bug but like
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:11 If you do the paint all with train wheels on a build
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:15 They don't get affected
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:20 But you can still paint them manually
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:47:44 I added a bit more detail to the front of my truck
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:48:01 Just redid the front bumper and the grill
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:50:01 I'm still debating putting a lightbar on it though.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:52:04 It's the kamacho from gta 5, not entirely built to match though since the kamacho from gta has garbage interior
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:52:58 It literally has flat interior doors with the textures ripped from the 3D counterparts.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:53:08 So it just looks like someone painted the doors interior on.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:54:29 Vip 1 is still outdated so i cant even work on my truck there unless i intend on redoing all the god damn signs on my build every time.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:56:04 Looks nice so far
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 03:56:15 It'll look better when painted though
creations-chat 2020-06-14 07:23:32 Oh rip forgot about that update there

general 2020-06-14 07:56:49 This truck legit disgusts me so bad
general 2020-06-14 07:56:58 I'm just picturing those fog lights in the bumper as buckteeth
general 2020-06-14 07:57:35 I was building a 1956 f100 and when i was looking through google images i saw that monstrosity

plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:53:02 Well actually there could be a replacement for motor locks anyways if roblox does patch it
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:53:12 You can manually change positions of constraints through their values
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:53:42 Meaning it could still be possible to have it offset a block intentionally, but it would likely need to be a whole new block alltogether.
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:54:06 Nice to know there's a toxic kid.
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:54:20 GJ, Your ass wouldn't ever be able to figure out how to build in studio either
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 06:54:32 Come back and try to diss people next time you can actually build shit yourself.
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:01:52 One thing might be able to replace locked motors when they get fixed
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:01:57 But it would act a bit differently rip
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:02:45 Welds, they'll just force the two blocks connected to be pulled into one spot, aside from that i'm not sure what else would replace the function there.
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:07:04 This could just get done instead to replace the locked motors if they ever do get patched
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:07:08 
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:07:48 I just used the cylinder to show that it clips into the other block.
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 07:08:59 Also, it would only move into place once unanchored, just like how locked motors acted.
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:08:16 I don't even know what to say about this
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:08:18 Somehow this didn't tip over all the way
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:13:03 Yay
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:17:53 It's even worse now
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:18:00 Guess we're screwed
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:22:03 "Roblox is being shut down 2020 😲"
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:22:08 stupid kid video title
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:22:24 I bet someones making a video of that right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:27:17 <@!400465835845615616> Its this website https://roblox.status.io/
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:27:30 Roblox had it on their site the one time during a problem so i just bookmarked it lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:32:14 Good news, roblox apparently found the problem and they're fixing it now... yay.
general 2020-06-17 02:39:17 <:cursedelmo:693336953017335808>
the-dump 2020-06-17 03:12:24 Ok, here's one, big funny because some dude spilled his coffee on the servers that's why roblox is having problems.
the-dump 2020-06-17 03:13:38 Have fun angry mods, imma go do stuff now
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 07:31:40 Idk what to even say about this "thing"
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 16:52:10 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:28:24 My plane got called ugly so it's not classifying under that one
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:29:10 I'm probs gonna post this thing in creations in a bit
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:29:19 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:29:25 I just finely tuned it again to make it fly properly
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:31:34 Anyone have any ideas for this? Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:31:40 It's got like a single gun hidden behind the front of it
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:32:45 I kinda want to try building this plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:33:00 It's some plane that was crashed in my city during the war that they just put up on display
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:33:14 Right by the zoo apparently
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:33:35 F-86 Sabre yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:36:22 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:36:40 I'd be surprised if someone hasn't already made one
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:37:56 I'm just picturing this now, the way that f-86 sabre was made
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:38:04 Seeing it just flying sucking birds right in through the front
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:38:11 leaving shredded up burnt bird bits out the back

plane-crazy 2020-07-03 13:21:17 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 13:21:59 Each block is 2 studs in height, length and width.
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 13:22:42 Nevermind a bit over 2 studs
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 13:22:45 But its about that
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 13:22:48 I think its 2.5
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:25 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:53 I used multikey macros before to manipulate a larger build once but i'd never ever call that a exploit
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:07:05 If anything its just triggering multiple keys with a single keystroke.
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:07:23 Not when its been programmed into a keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:07:26 Didnt exactly "install it"
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:07:47 Besides id laugh if someone literally got banned over a keyboard macro that was built into their keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:08:07 It was just one to assign multiple keys to a single key
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:30:32 My new truck is finally done
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:31:17 It has a oversized v8 too
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:31:32 
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:32:04 
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:32:07 Enough locked motors though
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:32:34 I have to actually do more though to do something with the front fenders later, just not really up for tearing it apart again rn
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:32:52 And sadly that hood needed 4 servos to open it
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:33:04 I couldnt do a single pivot hood, it kept getting stuck against the dashboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 08:33:20 I like 1 and 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 09:38:13 Now my truck is actually done, i forgot about the side mirrors again ofc
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 09:38:26 I swear like every car build i do, i forget to make the side mirrors and always end up doing them last
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 09:39:13 And i fixed the fender vent, its much more shallow, used to be a block deep vent, didn't really look right
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 02:24:11 I built some this out of boredom
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 02:25:44 It's powered by that hover thruster engine thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 02:25:55 Not sure what to even call it but i guess its closest comparison would have been a rotary engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 02:26:13 It has a ton of torque but not much speed thanks to its horrible gearing rip
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:30:26 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:30:32 I did a overhaul to my corvega build
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:30:44 Increased its top speed from 360 to 565
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:31:10 Still uses only motors though, just gave it new suspension in the front and rear to allow it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:31:38 Still looks about the same on its exterior
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:31:49 Underneath not so much lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:34:42 Well if half life is dystopian then
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:34:46 time to submit my jalopy
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:34:47 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:35:09 Nah im not getting involved in the event, don't really feel like spending a bunch of time making another vehicle rn
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:36:02 
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:36:08 What about that
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 09:36:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:45:51 I finished this weird lookin car
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:46:02 
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:46:38 It's roughly based on the chryslus rocket 69 from fallout
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 00:12:40 10/10 makes a great batmobile when painted black
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:41:42 I built a new drift truck lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:42:17 This was its older counterpart

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 10:27:33 I can't think of much to add to my truck, I'm sorta debating off if i should try to put some side turn signal lights on it or a bull bar if its even possible without ruining it
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 10:28:15 It's this truck i posted it in creations a few days ago https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/730222105790119977
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 10:28:28 Every bull bar i can think of would take up too much of its front
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 10:28:35 And just end up ruining the styling

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:02:45 About those people lagging servers that was mentioned like half an hour ago, i do something pretty evil to them
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:02:58 I just get my friend to bring out his large truck and me and him just go ripping right into the lava pools
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:04:36 My most recent build is this thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:04:57 Some noob said it wasn't a motorcycle though cause it has 4 wheels, even though they're placed side by side closely
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:05:39 If it isn't a motorcycle, then this is a car
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:06:00 That's a 4 wheeled motorcycle with a car engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:06:06 So i guess it's just a really compact car
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:06:29 I can run the "motorcycle" on just 2 wheels but it handles like garbage
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:06:33 Like it makes it much harder to turn
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:06:45 Just because there's either too much traction from wide wheels, or not enough with thin ones.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:08:22 3 wheeled motorcycles are still classified as motorcycles but there's a bit of a gap still between what 4 wheeled motorcycles even are
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:08:33 Like they're not cars, but they're apparently not motorcycles either.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:10:16 I'm laughing a bit rn, the Yamaha tesseract is a 4 wheeled motorcycle but wikipedia is trying to call it a quadricycle, which is a human powered 4 wheeled vehicle.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:10:47 Unless your pedaling that motorcycle around, don't think it classifies as anything related to a "quadricycle"
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 08:36:20 
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 08:36:45 I'll just prove to you how stupid the internet is
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 08:36:47 
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 08:37:22 
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 08:37:28 Right,totally sums up what that is.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 09:06:14 The dodge tomahawk is even more like a normal motorcycle in comparison to the yamaha tesseract, considering its wheels aren't even a foot apart
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:43:50 My one build that uses the most locked motors on it out of all of mine is literally this
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:43:57 Even though my giant 6x6 truck is assumed to have more
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:45:46 This truck uses less locked motors than my blue truck
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:46:04 1856 blocks on that truck, Definitely not fun to drive around with how bad it lags
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:47:17 I remember when roblox had no settings page security pin option
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:47:36 And you could literally just go on someone's account and set their age to 2 years old and just ruin their account
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:49:25 Imagine calling someone a unde by their account age alone, that's kinda cringe

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:22:10 I did a really significant facelift to my trophy truck

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:12:59 I made a robot arm out of boredom, works pretty well though
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:13:19 I sincerely hate how difficult it is to actually control one though, there's so many keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:14:25 I just used normal motors so it could have a better range of controls
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:14:29 It was using motor 2's earlier though
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:14:47 Just led to it being barely able to reach for things that needed "precision" movements for it
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:16:15 Yeah i wanted to give it more of a utility color scheme

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:40:25 I think roblox just did some update either that or my computer got faster for no apparent reason
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:40:46 My massive 6X6 pickup truck build has over 1,800 blocks, usually laggy when driving it given its size
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:41:06 But for whatever reason when i loaded it in a server it's been driving stupidly quick unaffected by lag like it normally would've been
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:46:49 It wasn't from rickje
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:46:55 Last update was 3 days ago.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:47:13 Yesterday i was having issues with lag still with my massive truck, but today it's just been working really well
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:47:18 Mind you a bit too well since it goes "flying"
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:47:57 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:47:59 Ends up just going too quick that it just bounces all over the place
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:48:21 That's on my truck with 1,825 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:48:48 I just don't recall it ever being that agile
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:49:10 Used to say it'd be going 300 but still moving at a relatively slow speed from the lag alone, so must've been something roblox did
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:01:59 Yeah i already know one of the main reasons
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:02:07 Roblox has bypassed decals on it.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:02:09 Some uh
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:02:28 Very nsfw things that aren't exactly easy to find but i still spot them on the platform.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:04:08 Another infamous one has to be bypassed tshirts
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:04:45 I see them pretty often, and you can use tshirts as decals still just by using their asset id so that's another problem with decals
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:05:14 Real shame it cant ever get added just because a majority of roblox's playerbase can't act mature.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:06:44 The sad thing is that it's actually older players too.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:07:03 Because older players should know better.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:08:05 tootipoodi, If someone's 16 and they're still doing stuff like that they need to grow up.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:08:17 And i don't expect you to even understand that one given this community even has players like that in it.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:08:45 First week of me being on the server some toxic users tried to start problems over a typo, that's immaturity at it's finest
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:10:28 Yeah because its flat
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:10:57 All those people disappearing? they fell off the edge
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:11:02 easy
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:15:15 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:15:26 I'm just waiting for someone to realize driving large builds doesn't lag now
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:15:37 But loading stupidly massive builds is a different story
bug-reports 2021-03-08 20:21:17 Shame people can't load builds with that many blocks now, i'm just glad none of my builds sit near that block count
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:22:04 I load a 1,800+ block truck and it just loads like normal so i'm not even sure what's going on there
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:22:10 I actually like the update roblox did lmao
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:22:18 My large vehicles don't lag now so
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:22:30 And the builds that used to torture entire servers? Well those can't be loaded now so
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:22:54 I guess there's sort a positive side, but hopefully rickje can figure out the "low lag" loading thing he apparently had planned.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:28:04 Noobs have been doing that for so long, no clue why
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:28:12 They'll just join plane crazy and start placing random blocks down
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:28:44 Not even in any attempt to make something, but just placing every block they can, usually rockets then trying to use it with the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 05:17:33 So close, but still failed
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 05:17:44 Got it stuck on the bump when i went to drive over it lmao
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 05:18:31 That's not why it got stuck, it's just ground clearance
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 05:18:58 Since my trophy truck sits around a block and a half off the ground

general 2021-10-29 08:22:37 Dunno
general 2021-10-29 08:22:49 Roblox studio used to function offline at one point
general 2021-10-29 08:22:57 I actually have the old port of roblox studio from like 2013 or so
general 2021-10-29 08:23:05 And it still works despite this whole "issue"
general 2021-10-29 08:25:40 big funny moment
general 2021-10-29 08:25:44 I did manage to make it launch though
general 2021-10-29 08:25:52 Had to launch it directly from its exe instead of by its own launcher
general 2021-10-29 08:26:10 Lol
general 2021-10-29 08:26:11 
general 2021-10-29 08:26:26 time to go build a house
general 2021-10-29 08:29:00 I'm still surprised this even works
general 2021-10-29 08:29:21 Albeit most features are non functional given they need to be able to access roblox's servers to work or are just legacy features now
general 2021-10-29 08:30:02 
general 2021-10-29 08:30:14 I actually had that on my old desktop computer
general 2021-10-29 08:30:23 But it wouldn't be very useful now since you cant do too much with it
general 2021-10-29 08:31:39 Funnily enough that version of studio is so old now it cant even be updated under any means
general 2021-10-29 08:31:49 The servers that were used to update it back then are long gone now
general 2021-10-29 08:32:00 Shit thing is, the file will exceed discords limit though f
general 2021-10-29 08:32:22 Well actually it might im not sure
general 2021-10-29 08:32:27 Its surprisingly not a big file no
general 2021-10-29 08:32:42 46.5 mbs in total
general 2021-10-29 08:32:52 Watch some mod threaten to ban me for posting files
general 2021-10-29 08:33:13 Nevermind, i cant even i might have to compress it if it even allows that lol
general 2021-10-29 08:34:49 Hm
general 2021-10-29 08:34:58 It apparently will post now
general 2021-10-29 08:35:11 Just question is, how are the mods gonna act from me posting a legacy studio build
general 2021-10-29 08:35:46 Well i'll just say this because i feel i'm obligated to incase any mods harass me about it later
general 2021-10-29 08:36:09 Don't download it if you don't trust it, just use it at your own risk i guess? Lmao
general 2021-10-29 08:36:24 It should technically work given its the entire folder there with all of its assets
general 2021-10-29 08:36:29 
general 2021-10-29 08:36:34 Funnily enough it can run off a flashdrive
general 2021-10-29 08:37:01 Its actually more or less the 2012 build
general 2021-10-29 08:37:23 
general 2021-10-29 08:37:31 If you do run it, just run robloxstudio.exe not robloxstudiolauncher
general 2021-10-29 08:37:38 You can try it if you want to run the launcher but it never worked for me
general 2021-10-29 08:40:55 Y'know what's gonna suck soon though
general 2021-10-29 08:41:08 The 2013 build of roblox studio will be rendered almost completely useless really soon
general 2021-10-29 08:41:15 Because it runs on internet explorer still
general 2021-10-29 08:41:23 At least the website half of it
general 2021-10-29 08:41:41 Not like it worked quite right to begin with since roblox is incompatible with internet explorer now
general 2021-10-29 08:48:06 I just remembered something...
general 2021-10-29 08:48:17 The old roblox studio still has the old physics engine running
general 2021-10-29 08:48:27 I can pull of my old suspension builds there
general 2021-10-29 08:49:27 Sadly i can't even test anything in the old roblox studio with a player since it won't work that way f
general 2021-10-29 08:51:51 It's painful how the old studio acts when it comes to resizing blocks...
general 2021-10-29 08:52:06 Its broken now enough to the point that 1,1,1 is stuck as 1,1.2,1
general 2021-10-29 08:52:18 You cant access the site on the old studio
general 2021-10-29 08:52:21 you gotta hit file then new
general 2021-10-29 08:52:32 Doesn't load with a baseplate either so you gotta do things a tad differently
general 2021-10-29 08:52:41 insert, then object, then a part
general 2021-10-29 08:52:43 Lol
general 2021-10-29 08:53:03 The toolbox is dead on it since it relys on roblox to work but roblox ended support for internet explorer
general 2021-10-29 08:54:56 You literally can't get rid of that
general 2021-10-29 08:55:02 I already told ye about it lol
general 2021-10-29 08:55:13 The 2013 Roblox Studio client runs on internet explorer
general 2021-10-29 08:55:29 but internet explorer is no longer supported by roblox so it will not run anything that requires contact with the site
general 2021-10-29 08:57:02 You cant, you'll have to click file in the top corner then new
general 2021-10-29 09:01:18 Got a question for some people here just to test em about old roblox physics
general 2021-10-29 09:01:27 Do you think this will remain static when i hit run?
general 2021-10-29 09:01:29 Or do you think it'll move
general 2021-10-29 09:01:39 The stack on the side is a bunch of motors on blocks attached to one another
general 2021-10-29 09:01:51 Watch
general 2021-10-29 09:02:05 When i hit run this happens
general 2021-10-29 09:02:07 
general 2021-10-29 09:02:09 That's old roblox physics for ye
general 2021-10-29 09:02:16 I used to make suspension that way
general 2021-10-29 09:02:24 SInce springs weren't a thing back then
general 2021-10-29 09:02:39 Only way around it was to change stiffness of the "springs" by making each segment thicker or thinner
general 2021-10-29 09:02:45 You cant
general 2021-10-29 09:02:54 It needs to access roblox's servers to load in a avatar sadly
general 2021-10-29 09:03:03 I might be able to "make" one yeah
general 2021-10-29 09:06:16 I don't remember how to weld everything on it but this is it so far lol
general 2021-10-29 09:10:47 Oh wait a minute i somewhat made the "npc" work in the old roblox studio lol
general 2021-10-29 09:10:57 It actually stands back up so that's a good sign
general 2021-10-29 09:11:01 Just has no animations or anything
general 2021-10-29 09:11:21 
general 2021-10-29 09:12:39 I can't get over how bad the npc bounces
general 2021-10-29 09:12:44 wth
general 2021-10-29 09:14:48 Yeah just invite it to your server, let it have admin perms then watch it ban everyone on the server including you lol
general 2021-10-29 09:14:52 That's probs what it'd do
general 2021-10-29 09:15:09 Things probably meant to go disable entire servers when its given perms
general 2021-10-29 09:17:10 Lmao
general 2021-10-29 09:46:49 I win
general 2021-10-29 09:47:19 I made the ultimate vehicle that would easily beat everything
general 2021-10-29 09:47:23 og roblox physics
general 2021-10-29 09:47:40 If its old physics were to interact with the new physics engine at the same time we'd all be screwed
general 2021-10-29 09:58:12 Lmao
general 2021-10-29 09:58:25 Ngl that spicy salsa is just too tempting
general 2021-10-29 09:58:37 Every time i bring out my truck i just can't help but go drive into it
general 2021-10-29 10:00:10 shit bob is dead
general 2021-10-29 10:00:25 I set his health to 0 and tried to set it back and nope
general 2021-10-29 10:00:29 he just tipped over and died
general 2021-10-29 10:01:29 bankupt moment
general 2021-10-29 10:19:49 I find it interesting how roblox's 2013 studio client has a print option...
general 2021-10-29 10:20:14 to print your place as a piece of paper... I think that's residual from the fact it runs on internet explorer... yikes
general 2021-10-29 10:20:28 Doesn't even serve a purpose other than the fact it pulls up a blank page as a print option
general 2021-10-29 10:22:35 
general 2021-10-29 10:22:39 damn
general 2021-10-30 01:48:06 Lmao
general 2021-10-30 01:48:15 That moment when a burrito event kills roblox
general 2021-10-30 01:49:56 At least its making some kids go touch grass for real instead of touching grass in a game
general 2021-10-30 01:50:05 lmao
general 2021-10-30 01:51:33 Fun fact, your inhaling someones dead skin rn
general 2021-10-30 01:51:48 LMAO
general 2021-10-30 01:53:50 I'm surprised people are even uploading stuff to creations still
general 2021-10-30 01:54:03 Must be just digging up old pics or somethin
general 2021-10-30 01:58:39 This is great
general 2021-10-30 01:58:52 that moment when your company goes bankupt
general 2021-10-30 01:59:13 Yeah its funny though ngl
general 2021-10-30 01:59:19 I know lmao
general 2021-10-30 01:59:40 Apparently some people believed it lol
general 2021-10-30 01:59:48 "Omg roblox is shutting down!?!?!?!"
general 2021-10-30 02:00:03 "How am i gonna find my virtual girlfriend now!!!"
general 2021-10-30 02:00:05 Lmao
general 2021-10-30 02:00:26 Nah apple can't even sue anyone properly
general 2021-10-30 02:00:31 They're only good at making normal things overpriced
general 2021-10-30 02:01:06 Yeah that still makes me laugh
general 2021-10-30 02:01:11 Funny thing is, it used to be places
general 2021-10-30 02:01:15 then it became "games"
general 2021-10-30 02:01:17 now its experiences
general 2021-10-30 02:01:21 experience pain more like
general 2021-10-30 02:03:23 They probs changed places to games and games to experiences because kids saying "wanna come over to my place" sounds creepy
general 2021-10-30 02:04:09 I'm still surprised i haven't gotten harassed yet by a mod for posting a fully functioning legacy build of studio
general 2021-10-30 02:04:12 Lol
general 2021-10-30 02:04:50 I mean it makes sense
general 2021-10-30 02:05:01 Go onto a erp game and you'll experience something alright, you'll experience pain
general 2021-10-30 02:05:07 and disgust of what modern society is
general 2021-10-30 02:05:30 Imagine erping... smh
general 2021-10-30 02:05:41 Lol
general 2021-10-30 02:06:18 Shame i'm not doing any halloween decorations irl this year
general 2021-10-30 02:06:26 I would've made this pumpkin lol
general 2021-10-30 02:06:52 Even funnier, make a jack-o-lantern and fill it with concrete
general 2021-10-30 02:07:01 then just wait until some stupid teen tries to smash the pumpkins like last year
general 2021-10-30 02:07:37 Yikes
general 2021-10-30 02:07:55 Seems legit
general 2021-10-30 02:08:18 Especially when your cars engine is literally crushed into the interior and it still drives
general 2021-10-30 02:08:59 Watch roblox just go down again in under an hour when it finally comes back up
general 2021-10-30 02:09:06 Because of the spike of little kids swarming back to adopt me
general 2021-10-30 02:09:31 Nah i'm not talking about rn lmao
general 2021-10-30 02:09:40 I'm saying when roblox does come back on, not sure when
general 2021-10-30 02:09:52 I can see roblox going down just because of the sudden spike in kids wanting to go there
general 2021-10-30 02:09:54 Lol
general 2021-10-30 02:10:14 One thing those kids should be thankful for is the fact that it probs saved them from making dumb trades on it again
general 2021-10-30 02:10:18 Or spending their moms credit card
general 2021-10-30 02:11:44 Perfect.
general 2021-10-30 02:12:24 Same reason why cookie clicker was popular
general 2021-10-30 02:12:41 Pointless games meant to generate income and attract people who are easily amused lol
general 2021-10-30 02:13:37 I remember kids spending like 300 R$ just for a fidget spinner gear ingame
general 2021-10-30 02:14:12 Especially sawblades
general 2021-11-03 23:46:19 Damn i didn't know spatial voice was even enabled
general 2021-11-03 23:46:21 
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 00:14:20 I don't think i ever posted a pic of this monstrosity before
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 00:14:22 
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 00:14:46 I made that monstrosity powered by a ton of propeller engines
general 2021-11-08 18:26:26 Damn that big funny development update
general 2021-11-08 18:26:33 Can't even show real development progress smh
general 2021-11-08 18:26:49 No wonder why people think the games never going to get a update
general 2021-11-08 18:26:56 There's just shitposting instead of actual development updates
general 2021-11-08 18:28:34 Ngl with how crap plane crazy's old code is i'm not even surprised that he'd want to make a new game
general 2021-11-08 18:28:51 Unless he's going to hire a team of scripters to fix the whole mess that plane crazy currently is in terms of scripting
general 2021-11-08 18:29:21 He def should hire some extra scripters though
general 2021-11-08 18:29:47 Pfft so his top secret dev team? Lol
general 2021-11-08 18:29:51 Hate to sound snarky but come on
general 2021-11-08 18:29:56 Literally never heard once about who any of them are
general 2021-11-08 18:30:11 It's a shame though
general 2021-11-08 18:30:18 Hopefully when the release ever comes out
general 2021-11-08 18:30:23 That they'll get recognized for it
general 2021-11-08 18:31:05 Well here's to hoping plane crazy eventually well, comes back from the brink of collapsing on old scripts
general 2021-11-08 18:31:26 Just hope it'll be worth it in the end lol
general 2021-11-19 01:29:44 Yeah people are obsessed with copying others builds so as soon as you post a single thing here, better be prepared for some kid to try to reverse engineer it
general 2021-11-19 01:29:45 lmao
general 2021-11-19 01:30:15 I posted a single pic of my differential build and not even a month later i saw someone else making one using the same technique i did
general 2021-11-19 01:30:27 Only part that sucked was the differential just barely fit in the max cylinder size
general 2021-11-19 01:30:39 But they still used the pics i posted as a reference point ffs
general 2021-11-19 01:30:57 Still not the point though Expiredcookie
general 2021-11-19 01:31:07 Just the fact alone they tried to do a carbon copy of my own one was a dead giveaway
general 2021-11-19 01:31:13 I laughed though when it didn't work
general 2021-11-19 01:31:17 They literally asked me for help on it
general 2021-11-19 01:31:21 as if i'd help them copy my own work
general 2021-11-19 01:31:56 Probs
general 2021-11-19 01:32:09 Ik one thing i used to do with mechanical suspension concepts on older building games like build and race
general 2021-11-19 01:32:21 I'd enclose the whole suspension system and drivetrain to stop people from copying it
general 2021-11-19 01:32:34 Just hides the mechanical aspect of it so they have no clue how it's inner workings are
general 2021-11-19 01:32:49 Either that or you could just find a way to make it look stupidly complex so they can't wrap their head around it
general 2021-11-19 01:33:03 Yeah sadly the og one is dead
general 2021-11-19 01:33:20 louis1199 had his account jacked by some dumb kid that i knew back then
general 2021-11-19 01:33:23 subeam was his user
general 2021-11-19 01:33:35 He literally went on for months intentionally breaking the baseplate there
general 2021-11-19 01:33:50 Then eventually went on v3rm and got some guy to jack louis's account... cringe
general 2021-11-19 01:34:43 Painful thing is when you use a differential on block wheels they uh
general 2021-11-19 01:34:45 slip a lot
general 2021-11-19 01:34:56 Unless you manage to incorporate a limited slip system
general 2021-11-19 01:36:28 I got a really mental engine build
general 2021-11-19 01:36:31 
general 2021-11-19 01:36:37 Oversized inline 4 that can't be used for anything
general 2021-11-19 01:36:48 It generates so much downforce that it can only be used on static things
bot-central 2021-11-19 01:37:53 -servers
general 2021-11-20 06:51:26 Damn it pains me lookin at a bunch of my old builds that i never finished
general 2021-11-20 06:51:42 Talkin about studio builds though
general 2021-11-20 06:51:43 Lol
general 2021-11-20 06:51:46 
general 2021-11-20 06:51:52 Like that was going to be a hatchback but i never finished it
general 2021-11-20 06:52:05 I could never quite figure out how i was going to do the back half of the car
general 2021-11-20 06:52:32 I'll likely just take it's front end off and use it on another car build instead just so at least that'll get used
general 2021-11-20 06:52:36 And just use it for a sedan or somethin
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:57:29 Just do what i did lmao, land train
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:58:00 I converted it into an actual vehicle for driving on land with because it could never quite work as a train when i did set it up with rollers n crap
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:58:16 Since it was too long to actually turn around the bends on the tracks
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:58:29 Some of those turns on the tracks are just too sharp lol
bot-central 2021-11-20 07:00:12 -servers
bot-central 2021-11-20 07:00:17 -expertservers
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:21:05 Got my weirdly engineered drone plane thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:21:10 Runs off hover thrusters lmao
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:21:29 I made the whole engine assembly spin freely so it won't affect the glider half
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:23:39 Sadly my only true engine build rn generates so much downforce it could never be used
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:24:13 
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:24:32 It's technically a 4 cylinder but runs more like a 2 cylinder with how the pistons are setup
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:25:03 I'd give it a true inline 4's engine cycle but there's the whole issue of not being able to actually fine tune their strokes properly
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:27:59 The thing that pains me though is the amount of people who refuse to believe things like that are even possible
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:28:14 "You probably just leave a propeller engine running on it the entire time"
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:28:15 bs
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:28:19 I only use it to start it
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:30:06 Whoops one sec
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:30:40 Here's a clip of it running
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:31:28 It runs using a relatively basic system it's just that the hover thrusters themselves generate downforce every time it runs a cycle
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:31:52 So unless i make that engine a lot smaller and able to produce the same output or more with less hover thrusters then no it's pretty much useless sadly
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:32:05 Still a cool build to screw around with though lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 16:59:48 So basically flying big boom haha machine
general 2022-03-04 03:27:32 👀
general 2022-03-04 03:35:45 Hey guys look what i built
general 2022-03-04 03:35:49 ion thruster
general 2022-03-04 03:38:01 ion thrusters are hardly mechanical anyways
general 2022-03-04 03:38:13 For a game
general 2022-03-04 03:38:37 Yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:39:20 Most building games on roblox barely put any effort into how their blocks look it's sad
general 2022-03-04 03:39:31 Like they do it like how a minimum wage worker would make it if they got paid to do it
general 2022-03-04 03:44:55 Yeah i made a industrial spotlight block too for some industrial vehicles like mining equipment etc
general 2022-03-04 03:47:20 I made it that shape so it looked more utilitarian
general 2022-03-04 03:47:44 I tried making one with a round lens and it just ended up looking like some boring old miners headlamp
general 2022-03-04 03:51:32 Yeah already got some working logic blocks enough to make some relatively complex systems
general 2022-03-04 03:51:45 Like sensors allowing someone to make a functional engine, even transmission systems
general 2022-03-04 03:52:17 Can even make a crude autopilot system with em
general 2022-03-04 03:53:55 Who?
general 2022-03-04 03:55:23 Yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:55:29 I wonder when plane crazy will get a logic system
general 2022-03-04 03:55:44 Hopefully plane crazy 2 introduces some degree of advanced wiring
general 2022-03-04 03:55:51 So players can make more complex creations etc
general 2022-03-04 03:56:42 Hell even one feature that'd be really useful for this game would be gears
general 2022-03-04 03:56:52 But i doubt that'd be added for some time
general 2022-03-04 03:57:07 Hopefully the collisions would be better than the first time the cylinders got "optimized"
general 2022-03-04 03:57:25 Yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:57:37 So you could adjust the gear ratios properly, maybe even make a crude mechanical transmission
general 2022-03-04 03:57:52 Cause even without the use of logic systems you could still make one but the gears are a necessity for that one
general 2022-03-04 03:58:07 Such a shame though seeing all those large mechanical builds on the game that could be made 10x better with stuff like that
general 2022-03-04 03:58:16 Who knows, maybe even larger cylinders
general 2022-03-04 03:58:42 Yeah could even make detailed wheels out of them actually
general 2022-03-04 03:58:57 Although it'd take some skill to do, it'd be worth it
general 2022-03-04 04:00:01 Hopefully plane crazy get's more frequent updates in the future though
general 2022-03-04 04:00:25 Who knows maybe even make a better alternative to motorlocking
general 2022-03-04 04:00:39 So you don't need like 10 locked motors to put the bodywork in place on detailed builds
general 2022-03-04 04:01:01 But rather just one block that can be adjusted to retract on a xyz axis or somethin
general 2022-03-04 04:01:16 Cause locked motors are pretty limiting on small builds, hell even large ones cause you have to try to hide them
general 2022-03-04 04:01:33 And lets face it, locked motors ruin the appearance of builds so fast whenever they're visible
general 2022-03-04 04:01:51 But at least with an adjustable one you could hide it better
general 2022-03-04 04:02:34 Cause being able to adjust how much it offsets blocks would come in handy, especially for fine details
general 2022-03-04 04:02:44 Instead of being limited to a half block retraction every time
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:04:13 Shame the motor locks can't be adjusted like to pull blocks in more
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:04:30 Instead of having to like stack them
general 2022-03-04 04:07:33 Yeah i actually work for two games
general 2022-03-04 04:11:11 xbox live gamerpic
