general 2022-05-30 08:53:20 hi
general 2022-05-30 08:54:39 are there any plane crazy - based groups?
general 2022-05-30 08:54:52 really!?
general 2022-05-30 08:54:59 lol
general 2022-05-30 08:55:00 what are they?
general 2022-05-30 08:55:07 -server
general 2022-05-30 08:55:12 -servers
general 2022-05-30 08:55:15 ah
general 2022-05-30 08:55:48 hmm... maybe there should be like an advertising channel for the groups to show themselves
general 2022-05-30 08:56:00 that would be really helpful for groups to get members
general 2022-05-30 08:56:08 and to be known in general
general 2022-05-30 08:56:33 a lot of discord servers do
general 2022-05-30 08:56:43 even shipping lanes has company advertising
general 2022-05-30 08:57:12 shush I played it in like 2017
general 2022-05-30 08:57:17 alpha/beta stuff
general 2022-05-30 08:57:22 and yes true
general 2022-05-30 08:57:26 I can agree
general 2022-06-03 07:50:01 hi
general 2022-06-03 07:50:10 I just want to know if thereâ€™s any pc groups
general 2022-06-03 07:50:57 real?
general 2022-06-03 07:51:00 I know like none
general 2022-06-28 01:56:26 does anybody know any plane crazy groups?
general 2022-06-28 01:56:34 (there is no advertising channel cringe)
general 2022-06-28 01:56:46 I meant as in
general 2022-06-28 01:56:52 military groups
general 2022-06-28 01:57:04 basically people make creations, go to war with one-another and whatnot
general 2022-06-28 01:57:10 seperate from the official one here
general 2022-06-28 01:57:16 they're player based
general 2022-06-28 01:57:17 welp
general 2022-06-28 01:58:39 I think the server needs a certain minimum amount of members
general 2022-06-28 01:58:48 to be discoverable on community
general 2022-06-28 01:58:51 in discord
general 2022-06-28 02:00:19 lol
general 2022-06-28 02:00:44 any sensical ones?
general 2022-06-28 02:00:59 welp
general 2022-06-28 02:01:15 guess the idea's better than the way it's made...

general 2023-03-25 06:17:15 Unrelated to discussion question:

I see in some images in <#384025409945337856>, people have a really nice (shader? filter?) I was wondering if it is edited after taking the photo or if there is a way to install the thing into plane crazy itself
general 2023-03-25 06:18:31 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/993258613005111406/unknown.png?width=1236&height=671

like for example this epic creation
general 2023-03-25 06:19:37 it is very nice yeah
general 2023-03-25 06:19:40 but about the question
general 2023-03-25 06:19:46 just... how?
general 2023-03-25 06:19:57 is it edited with a filter after taking the image or is it some sort of addon?
general 2023-03-25 06:46:18 yeah

My plane is too front-heavy, and it means I literally can't get it off the ground. I've put helium beams and blocks in the nose but it isn't doing much. Any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 07:57:34 It's like something's pulling it very hard to the ground
general 2023-06-25 04:59:59 quick question
