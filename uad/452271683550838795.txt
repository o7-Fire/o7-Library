creations-chat 2021-03-19 02:02:56 <@658153536047022090> ur build isnt new, there is a more compact way to do it too
general 2021-03-19 02:04:02 <@658153536047022090> okay 👍
general 2021-03-19 02:05:06 It’s for the experience
general 2021-03-19 02:05:15 Plus you would be able to make differentials
general 2021-03-19 02:05:32 Using bearings and motor locking them together
general 2021-03-19 02:05:55 ^^^^^^^^ that’s the point
general 2021-03-19 02:05:59 .
general 2021-03-19 02:07:05 Plus you could make stacked motors spin 5x faster... like my 10 motor 1:5 gear (cylinder) ratio
general 2021-03-19 02:07:20 You could add another 1:5 onto it and make it spin much faster
general 2021-03-19 02:07:28 There’s a point where the motors would just break
general 2021-03-19 02:07:41 
general 2021-03-19 02:08:08 It’s for the experience 🤭
general 2021-03-19 02:08:25 Cylinders skip too much
general 2021-03-19 02:08:31 Not enough experience
general 2021-03-19 02:09:32 Gears would help people understand how things move

creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:10:03 <@!467459282250629120> the problem with cylinder “gears” is that if u apply **L i t e r a l l y any** resistance, they slip
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:29:22 I’m talkin about like slapping it on a car
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:31:09 Oh, gg then

I’m the type of person that if it’s not perfect, I’m not happy. Even with my gears that are incredibly reliable, I’m not really too happy about them
general 2021-09-03 02:31:52 <@!467459282250629120> rip
general 2021-09-03 02:32:37 I can teach u my gears if u want
