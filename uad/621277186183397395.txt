creations-chat 2021-12-12 14:36:31 so far how does it look, if it's bad I need a feedback and suggestion
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:30:00 When your bored of building in game so you build irl
the-dump 2022-11-23 22:17:30 Blind stick that has sensor that can detect object in front of it
the-dump 2022-11-28 02:41:17 Plane Crazy but hard
the-dump 2022-11-28 02:49:02 Yes
the-dump 2022-11-28 02:49:18 I wanna try it with Nano but the simulation doesnt have Nano
the-dump 2022-11-28 02:49:33 Cuz Arduino is bigger
the-dump 2022-11-28 03:25:27 I mean if you want to simulate it, you can use Tinkercad. But the real thing? You can buy it online. But it will be better if you test it first in Tinkercad before buying the component and building it.
the-dump 2022-11-28 03:25:56 I also dont have Arduino, and im going to buy it and make it real
the-dump 2022-11-28 03:26:30 Oh
the-dump 2022-11-28 03:26:41 Just buy it man
