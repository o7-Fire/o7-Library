creations-chat 2022-12-04 01:31:36 You could probably improve the length and shape of the nose, those engines are massive, and does it have gear? also, what are those beams on top and the wing? 🤓

help 2022-12-14 02:41:53 It needs soft terrain to work (which plane crazy doesnt have), so if u want it to work I would recommend using wing panels instead of fabric blocks (wing panels might work on land and will definitely work in the water)
help 2022-12-14 02:47:23 There is no reason to do that... while paint sliding, all ur doing is hitting the tiny hitbox on the side that is for the back of the sign
