general 2020-03-06 20:49:36 Oh no.
general 2020-03-06 20:49:42 I've made a Vectored-Thrust A-10!
general 2020-03-06 20:49:55 Using the hover blocks lol
general 2020-03-06 20:50:13 This is  actually cool though.
general 2020-03-06 20:50:51 Landings are so much more epic now...
general 2020-03-06 20:53:44 I'm thinking of  changing up the frame of the A-10 now, to accommodate the upgrade to VT
general 2020-03-06 21:07:00 
general 2020-03-06 21:07:02 Vector-Thrust MQ-120A
general 2020-03-06 21:08:00 It can fly at about Mach .7
general 2020-03-06 21:08:45 6 XN-E4 Shrike Missiles
general 2020-03-06 21:09:17 2 AGM-190 Devestator DLGA Rockets
general 2020-03-06 21:09:54 And an interior-mounted Miniturized FOF Super Gravity Cannon
general 2020-03-06 21:10:21 I was just showing you guys...
general 2020-03-06 21:10:56 Mk fine
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:13:19 ``Vector-Thrust MQ-120A, 6x XN-E4 Shrike Missiles, 2x AGM-190 Devestator DLGA Rockets, 1x Internal Miniturized FOF Super Gravity Cannon, Top Speed: Mach .7``
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:13:43 I have it  in a flawless hover here...
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:05 A basic run turbo, I'm still working on the design
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:17 When it's done it shouldn't even be able to be recognised
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:33 I needed a base and I liked that model though
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:50 I could work on a tank though.
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:58 What are those wheels
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:18:13 I hit the build limit and I couldn't finish my giant PA.
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:18:31 Just because I changed the scale  from 1x1 to 2x2
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:18:49 Every square in the PA was now 4 blocks ingame total
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:18:56 And...
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:19:27 
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:19:28 It no work
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:19:57 I wonder if I can find a way to make Kongou from Arpeggio of Blue Steel..
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:19:58 NO
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:00 YOU
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:05 that's  not sans
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:20 No.
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:25 I'm very sure it isn't.
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:29 It does not.
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:09 ...
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:21 
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:26 Not sans
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:54:03 AX-40 Low-Altitude Light Transport Has Been Completed. For Now.
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:55:54 
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:56:07 Sorry, I was just messing around and I got the idea.
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:56:15 I know it looks like a YF-23
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:56:23 But it's only meant to hover.
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:56:38 Yes.
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:58:19 Highest straight-line speed without any hills/obstructions  is 95
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 07:58:35 It's not built for speed
general 2020-03-10 07:59:06 Question. What units are Speed and Altitude measured by ingame?
general 2020-03-10 07:59:27 Like MPH/ KPH, Feet/Meters?
general 2020-03-10 08:00:50 Wait, so that's...
general 2020-03-10 08:01:37 Theres 160934.4 Centimeters in a Mile
general 2020-03-10 08:01:48 So,
general 2020-03-10 08:02:16 1 MPH is 1 Mile Traversed in 60 Minutes
general 2020-03-10 08:02:28 So, 160934.4 times 60
general 2020-03-10 08:02:41 Sorry, I need a clocitulator
general 2020-03-10 08:07:43 So.
general 2020-03-10 08:08:41 I am correct.
general 2020-03-10 08:11:28 Okay.
general 2020-03-10 08:11:31 I was wrong, actually.
general 2020-03-10 08:11:56 15 Speed Ingame = 1 MPH Real
general 2020-03-10 08:14:26 Lemme  do the math
general 2020-03-10 08:14:37 No.
general 2020-03-10 08:14:49 The math is different from whatever the hell just happened there
general 2020-03-10 08:14:56 1 Stud is 5 Centimeters
general 2020-03-10 08:15:53 No, 1 Stud = 5 Centimeters
general 2020-03-10 08:16:03 If You can find  how many centimeters in a mile
general 2020-03-10 08:16:05 Which is
general 2020-03-10 08:16:13 160934.4 Centimeters
general 2020-03-10 08:17:01 9656064
general 2020-03-10 08:17:10 Wait hold it
general 2020-03-10 08:17:37 Yeah
general 2020-03-10 08:17:53 160934.4 Times 60 is 9656064
general 2020-03-10 08:18:48 No, wait
general 2020-03-10 08:19:04 160934 Divided by 60 is 2682 centimeters in a minute
general 2020-03-10 08:19:45 Now divided again is about
general 2020-03-10 08:19:52 44.7 Centimeters per Second
general 2020-03-10 08:20:45 Yes
general 2020-03-10 08:20:47 Which is 9
general 2020-03-10 08:20:50 bru
general 2020-03-10 08:20:54 No.
general 2020-03-10 08:21:00 Quit with that childish joke
general 2020-03-10 08:21:46 9 Speed is 1MPH
general 2020-03-10 08:21:50 Well.
general 2020-03-10 08:21:59 That's  some pretty exhausting shit there.
general 2020-03-10 08:23:51 So Basically
general 2020-03-10 08:23:57 At my top speed of 95 Speed (Studs)
general 2020-03-10 08:24:03 I'm going  about 11 MPH
general 2020-03-10 08:28:15 This is hard to control my Stabilators.
general 2020-03-10 08:28:38 And no, I'm not making a mistake
general 2020-03-10 08:28:44 Not stabilizers, stabilators
general 2020-03-10 08:28:49 Because there's only two
general 2020-03-10 08:29:07 So, like on the  YF-23 Black Widow II
general 2020-03-10 08:29:22 And there's only two Tail stabilators
general 2020-03-10 08:29:29 At a 90 Degree angle
general 2020-03-10 08:29:50 Look
general 2020-03-10 08:30:49 Dude wait
general 2020-03-10 08:31:13 
general 2020-03-10 08:31:14 Look at those Stabilators
general 2020-03-10 08:31:28 Because there's only two, it's a  mix of the  Stabilizers and the Elevators
general 2020-03-10 08:31:40 Because they do both jobs at the same time.
general 2020-03-10 08:31:54 So, not Stabilizers, they're known as  Stabilators.
general 2020-03-10 08:32:51 Dude my  reaction to that video in <#384021699466756107> is those two keybinds `T` `F`
general 2020-03-10 08:33:20 What is your fastest vehicle
general 2020-03-10 08:33:23 Like, without bugs
general 2020-03-10 08:33:29 Without Mag Drives
general 2020-03-10 08:33:40 Like, a Car
general 2020-03-10 08:33:46 Just straight-line speed
general 2020-03-10 08:34:12 I still love my MQ-120
general 2020-03-10 08:35:46 No Bugs, No Mag Drives, Just Level-Off Straight Line Speed
general 2020-03-10 08:37:51 My car is being  a pain in the ass
general 2020-03-10 08:38:56 I can't even guage my cars top speed
general 2020-03-10 08:43:06 Well, one of my cars flying speed can go about 20 mph
general 2020-03-10 08:45:33 I JUST DROPPED SOMEONE INSIDE THE VOLCANO
general 2020-03-10 08:45:52 <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>

general 2020-03-18 02:56:26 Wait, who?
general 2020-03-18 02:56:35 I don't even know what's happening here.

general 2020-03-18 02:56:58 Yes, I know this.
general 2020-03-18 02:57:14 Just the situation as I came in.
general 2020-03-18 02:57:29 Right after I said something, hyper started cracking down on someone for being underage
general 2020-03-18 02:57:38 And I was like
general 2020-03-18 02:57:50 "Holy shit, why this again. I've already proved I was 13+!"
general 2020-03-18 02:58:05 And then I realized it was that sad soul
general 2020-03-18 02:58:18 That was getting ripped from this beautiful server
general 2020-03-18 02:58:31 By his own stupid idea to be born less than 13 years ago.
general 2020-03-18 02:59:36 Jackoon, may I ask you a science question?
general 2020-03-18 03:00:14 How much Hydrogen can I inhale before I spintaniously explode from the heat of my body igniting the hydrogen?
general 2020-03-18 03:00:25 Oh shit!

general 2020-03-18 03:01:00 Someone needs to put some queen on in a VC
general 2020-03-18 03:01:12 Because everyone is just biting the dust.

general 2020-03-18 03:01:45 Or,
general 2020-03-18 03:01:47 HMM.

general 2020-07-07 07:08:35 Sorry, I was too busy dealing with the fact that I lost an entire Gamepass somehow.
general 2020-07-07 07:08:44 So yeah.
general 2020-07-07 07:08:53 haha

the-dump 2020-07-08 00:59:18 
the-dump 2020-07-14 06:06:34 *A ship cannot attack a Submari-*
the-dump 2020-07-14 06:06:57 Surcoaf called, they want their  joke back
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 07:50:02 FV that tank is Uncanny
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:12:13 Mega
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:12:14 woah
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:12:31 224, what ship class is that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:12:47 What did you base it off?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:13:11 Almost looks like a *Kongo*-class Base
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:13:17 Welp,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:13:46 Here's a little  cinematic-like of *U-2501*, *Milchkuh*, and some partials of the little *Seehund* Midget Subs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:14:23 Lonk
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:14:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:14:28 Does look like a Kongo
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:15:04 I mean Kongo base.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:15:18 Turret Placement and Superstructure, along  with hull
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:16:16 I don't know if anybody remembers  my Endeaver to build *I-401*, but it was just Absolut Lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:16:32 While *U-2501* seems to be much smoother
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:16:45 Likely because of size difference, One second..
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:17:48 As you see,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:17:57 Sen-Toku *I-401*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:18:31 Lol they look like Rookie Phalanx guns
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:19:02 and then, to compare with Sen-Toku *I-401*,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:19:18 *U-2501* with *Milchkuh* and *Seehund* Midget Subs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:20:56 and  heck, to even compare,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:21:04 Light Cruiser *Nagara*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:21:22 Not sure Fish.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:21:55 I'm having  a problem with Nagara though,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:22:07 Whenever my Smoke is going, and I start Accelerating forward,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:22:12 The smoke goes  forward.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:22:28 and ends up enveloping my forward mask
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:22:30 mast*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:22:40 Is this a bug?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:23:39 as you see here.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:23:51 I'm moving forward.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:23:58 Ah, as I thought lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:24:25 I did take advantage of those nice Motor2's for my Turrets on both *I-401* and *Nagara*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:24:41 Yeah, I have  *Fixed* Option on
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:24:44 On all of them.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:25:22 but yeah, I had to completely build *U-2501*'s hull from scratch.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:25:46 aha
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:26:15 Reminds me of a *Schlachtschiff H* design Battleship.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:26:48 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:26:54 Supensionity
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:27:01 Are those Richelieu guns?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:27:14 Cool.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:27:22 Well,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:27:31 I noticed instantly from the Quad-barrel Design.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:27:58 And the difference between the Richelieu multiple Quad barrel and the  *King George V*'s Single Forward Quad Turret.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:28:39 Althought I am confused,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:01 as to why the Hull Bulge is contained within the hull itself.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:08 and not seperate.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:14 Is it detail?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:24 Ah.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:30 Detail choice or Detail Limits?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:43 It would be pretty hard to seperate bulge from the red of the bow.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:29:58 But also would make it fairly unstable as I could  gues-
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:30:07 *spits out the water I had* woah lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:30:26 That is quite intimidating.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:30:41 I don't think he knows,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:30:49 those guns  weren't fitted with PVP weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:31:03 Dude, I want yo join your server lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:31:25 shinx,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:31:49 > battleships have vanished from the pvp gamemode
<@!434989303882579981> 
it's because they get assaulted by shredders
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:32:18 They've been outpowered by Bombers and  Shredder Bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:32:34 As well as my fun little  Drone Turret Platform.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:33:21 Well, not really true for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:33:28 I'll shoot them up, but for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:33:40 Either due to Roblox physics or something else,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:33:43 it just keeps flying
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:33:59 It'll be missing about 2/3 of the shredder but it's  still flying around
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:34:32 I just realized what your actual name was
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:34:46 Roblox Physics when you shoot a shredder bug in half
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:34:49 *Ah yes, the Negotiator*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:36:35 You wouldn't mind if  I built a 40-mile long runway, wouldn't you?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:36:55 oh nevermind, something else just took precidence >:)
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:37:34 Ah, this will require me to strip off *I-401*'s entire deck.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:38:17 Except for Gravity Slider
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:40:26 I need an opinion from some genuine PC players,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:41:09 Should people actually think less of other people if they use Tutorials?
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:41:32 Because  I see people who use Tutorials alot, and alot of the people on the  server just start yelling at them for having absolutely no skill
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:42:29 Well,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:42:48 I'll look at Tutorials to pick up on little details,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:43:13 to kinda find little details to help when I'm building my own stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:43:37 almost like tips or just genuine designs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:43:51 Like my AA mounts on my *I-401*
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:44:19 I got the design idea for the AA mounts on my submarine from a Truck tutorial.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:44:34 Not copying,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:44:59 I really don't care about your opinion.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:45:12 wow, ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:45:26 I built the entire  submarine and  I needed Design ideas for the Turrets,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:45:30 so after looking around,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:45:47 I compiled some tricks other people used along with my own twist,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:46:01 and  made completely custom AA Mounts.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:46:10 Using details  and  tricks I saw other people use,
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:46:17 Nah, I don't  do those
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:46:22 No offense but gross
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:47:01 I'll just take little things like Turret designs or say Vehicle shapes, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:47:18 and I'll use it to support when I build  a Custom build.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:47:35 It's actually quite interesting  what you come up with.
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:47:39 eXoKay
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 09:48:10 are you deaf or blind  I just said 
> I really don't care about your opinion.

plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:36:29 Yamato superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:37:45 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:37:51 that really looks like Izumo
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:38:32 Now this.
This  Izumo.
Looks like something someone would build in Plane Crazy legit no lie.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:38:41 no get your Richelieu Successor off my screen.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:38:57 Suspens that Richelieu Successor lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:39:15 I said

plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:41:51 I'm wrong
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:42:13 Richelieu successor was *Alsace*
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:42:31 Seriously,
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:43:17 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:43:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:43:22 another Fictional
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:43:53 Wow
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:43:57 Suspen
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:01 Azuma was an
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:04 Armored Cruiser
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:15 Technically named *Adzuma*
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:23 Armored Cruiser
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:26 not Heavy  Ccruiser
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:32 that's because WoWS has fictionals
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:35 Like the Izumo BB
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:44:54 Izumo is also an Armored cruiser.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:03 But Wargaming gave us a Super BB
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:24 But it's the same concept,
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:35 One ship having the same  name  as a much lighter ship,
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:43 but being totally buffed and  fictional,
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:48 Wow.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:45:55 I'm not 100% Naval History, hah

plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:47:25 Ur Fictional Heavy Cruiser Azuma reminds me of my Fiction Mogami Successor Heavy Cruiser Satsuma.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:48:30 hmm...
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:48:35 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:48:41 ofc not,
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:48:54 too recenlty designed looking.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:49:10 Older Carriers like Graf Zep have a certain look to them.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 09:49:11 yeah lol

general 2020-08-12 22:34:34 You know at 6 inches Mantis Shrimp have the power of a 22 Rifle V
general 2020-08-12 22:35:01 It'll break ur skull.
general 2020-08-12 22:35:23 Wish me luck bois
general 2020-08-12 22:35:56 One-Punch Shrimp will soon enter the battlefield and none will be able to defeat me at CQC
general 2020-08-12 22:36:45 Imma be punching tanks away
general 2020-08-12 22:37:29 Also I'll probably add some Blast Shields to my ships
general 2020-08-12 22:37:42 Like Torpedo Shields, or Tank Skirts.
general 2020-08-12 22:37:58 Don't worry
general 2020-08-12 22:38:03 I'll be  sure  to add Rocket Pods
general 2020-08-12 22:38:17 Actually the design reminds  me  of a certain walker...
general 2020-08-12 22:38:28 Then I'll fire another one.
general 2020-08-12 22:38:42 You realize I can set different Keybinds for each missile?
general 2020-08-12 22:39:00 I just fire  1 at a time until one hits you
the-dump 2020-08-12 22:45:16 Yikes so before I build the Mantis Shrimp Imma have to build this walker V
the-dump 2020-08-12 22:59:44 Not too hard though,
the-dump 2020-08-12 23:00:28 there's a fairly simple walker design that reminded me of that walker, so I can use the walker design as a base, maybe update  it.
the-dump 2020-08-12 23:18:18 Yikes

the-dump 2020-08-13 02:20:59 If you can say *Fuck* here, I would think you can say anything.
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:21:01 But ok
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:21:17 Common sense must be failing me today
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:21:20 but to be honest,
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:21:24 Not very many people have it
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:21:50 so I might be the one in 1,000,000 that  happens to be in this server that actually has it.
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:22:42 > No, you just seem to have a slight case of autism my guy.
<@!456238251204935690> that's actually offensive to people
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:22:53 No that's offense.
general 2020-08-13 02:23:32 Puri <@!456238251204935690> is saying I have Autism isn't that  offensive to people who actually have autism?
general 2020-08-13 02:23:41 WOOOOO NEVADA
general 2020-08-13 02:24:06 *smh* Expired stop calling  people Autistic is that your only insult
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:24:26 <@!335599526414909451> Earrape video
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:24:39 No it isn't
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:24:58 Dude I have  a headache now
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:03 I was wearing
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:07 *e a r b u d s*
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:12 Nonono,
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:18 Earrape videos are just common sense
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:36 No server  I have ever  known has allowed Earrape videos,
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:49 That's like a fucking Discord Commandment.
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:56 Then why did the Mod remove it?
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:25:59 If it was  allowed?
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:26:29 😮
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:26:32 amazing
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:26:35 Hm
general 2020-08-13 02:31:24 Yo bro <@!335599526414909451> but I just noticed that Earrape videos are  condoned by the rules you need to make a  rule about that or I'll report the server for allowing unsafe content, I just got a headache from a video earlier and there are people who  are sensitive to that kind of thing or it can permanantly damage their ears.
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:32:04 Because skill
the-dump 2020-08-13 02:32:10 the power of Turning Differential
general 2020-08-13 02:33:52 Purified I pinged you to make a rule about Earrape Videos or I'll report the server for condoning unsafe content that could Disorient or even Injure people.
general 2020-08-13 02:34:39 <@!315262125113081856> , I didn't know it was an earrape, and the poster didn't alert me that it was an earrape.
general 2020-08-13 02:36:16 Sympt maybe not spam rick.
general 2020-08-13 02:36:33 It's not  for nothing
general 2020-08-13 02:37:08 The server condones content that could Disorientate or Injure people.
general 2020-08-13 02:37:17 I cannot allow that.
general 2020-08-13 02:37:48 Unless you want lawsuits from people  that have suffered Seizures from Epileptic Videos or Have gone Deaf from Earrape Videos.
general 2020-08-13 02:37:57 Which, last time I checked
general 2020-08-13 02:38:00 they're both condoned.
general 2020-08-13 02:38:11 But it's not against the rules,
general 2020-08-13 02:38:18 You need to make it against  the rules.
general 2020-08-13 02:38:37 <@!315262125113081856> I can't, that's Youtube.
general 2020-08-13 02:38:57 It would be a report because the server is condoning the content,
general 2020-08-13 02:39:15 But  check the rules.
general 2020-08-13 02:39:18 No, Sympt
general 2020-08-13 02:39:28 It's not the same.
general 2020-08-13 02:39:39 It's not against Youtube's ToS,
general 2020-08-13 02:39:53 but  it's against all other  Discord Server's Rules.
general 2020-08-13 02:40:03 It should be against this one's as well.
general 2020-08-13 02:40:14 Because they delete it.
general 2020-08-13 02:40:18 it should be a warn.
general 2020-08-13 02:40:41 <@!315262125113081856> you blind?
general 2020-08-13 02:41:00 I literally said it's not against Youtube ToS, but it's against Discord Server Rules as a whole.
general 2020-08-13 02:41:42 You have to be more specificc than "show me where in the tos"
general 2020-08-13 02:42:41 <@!456238251204935690> so is this server trying to be different from all the others
general 2020-08-13 02:42:59 Never have I seen one server that condones Excessively Loud or Epileptic content.
general 2020-08-13 02:43:20 Just if you're going to warn people for it then put it in the rules please.
general 2020-08-13 02:44:00 <@!429826358827417601> that ToS doesn't condone anyone getting *Injured* by content
general 2020-08-13 02:59:09 Just perm mute me.
