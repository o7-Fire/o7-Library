general 2021-04-26 01:00:22 The only thing I can‚Äôt understand in game is the stupidity of some people
general 2021-04-26 01:01:30 ‚ÄúMy plane not werk‚Äù yeah I wonder why it doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt even have the IQ to spell

general 2021-04-29 10:41:20 I have a player to report who uses an extremely toxic build
general 2021-04-29 10:44:38 No it‚Äôs a different player but I don‚Äôt have image perms
general 2021-05-02 19:44:35 Why am I not allowed to submit a suggestion
general 2021-05-02 19:45:10 Oh ok
general 2021-05-02 19:45:32 Anyways, we need improved pistons
general 2021-05-02 19:47:06 We need a cylindrical piston (like a cylinder but a piston)
general 2021-05-02 19:47:34 We also need different sizes of pistons
general 2021-05-02 19:48:27 1x1, 2x2 (yes ik we already have that), and a 3x3 for large machinery
general 2021-05-02 19:48:58 I‚Äôm talking pistons here
general 2021-05-02 19:50:59 The current version‚Äôs pistons are very unstable as hell and can fling your vehicle if too much pressure is implemented
general 2021-05-03 02:50:57 Wth that was too funny
general 2021-05-03 02:51:10 I went so fast that my game crashed
general 2021-05-03 02:52:41 Who wants to see how fast I went
general 2021-05-03 02:52:44 Wait
general 2021-05-03 02:52:52 No image perms
general 2021-05-03 02:53:12 No one asked you to be toxic about it
bot-central 2021-05-03 02:53:39 !rank
general 2021-05-03 02:54:25 Because you want to start a huge argument over how nobody cares

general 2021-05-03 02:55:45 among us
general 2021-05-06 02:14:15 I‚Äôm getting real tired of the car controls
general 2021-05-06 02:14:22 It keeps bugging out
general 2021-05-06 02:14:42 And reversing the x axis controls
general 2021-05-06 02:14:57 Not helpful
general 2021-05-06 02:15:17 It rly isn‚Äôt
general 2021-05-06 02:15:30 shut up
general 2021-05-06 02:16:02 <@!466793357318815744> toxic people
general 2021-05-06 02:16:09 Being extremely rude
general 2021-05-06 02:16:46 They keep saying skill issue when there is an in game bug
general 2021-05-06 02:17:34 Because they are constantly repeating it
bug-reports 2021-05-06 02:18:38 Bug when controlling car on mobile. 
When testing, the x axis controls occasionally reverse
general 2021-05-06 02:20:03 Wow probs the most disgusting behavior I‚Äôve ever seen from any discord mod in my lifetime
general 2021-05-06 02:20:20 Toxic community
general 2021-05-06 02:21:00 Do it
general 2021-05-26 00:36:54 What is the new update have?
general 2021-06-22 17:19:56 What level for image perms?
general 2021-06-22 17:20:34 Wth I didn‚Äôt have them until I said that
general 2021-06-22 17:20:49 Epic
general 2021-06-22 17:21:08 Now I can finally propose a suggestion
general 2021-06-22 17:23:06 I want them to add a better piston system
general 2021-06-22 17:23:35 
general 2021-06-22 17:24:48 Because this is how I lock my Destroyer. (this is due to the motor being really heavy for some weird reason and causing my boat to list)
general 2021-06-22 17:28:02 Hopefully it flies
general 2021-06-22 17:28:08 Omg
general 2021-06-22 17:28:29 I‚Äôve seen that, and was like: that‚Äôs advanced as hell
general 2021-06-22 17:28:43 Color is a bit off
general 2021-06-22 17:28:58 Ahh ok
general 2021-06-22 17:29:05 It looks good then
general 2021-06-22 17:34:15 They need to make pistons similar to Minecraft pistons, where they extend a block and do not move, unlike the current ones. They move around while in motion
general 2021-06-22 17:34:47 So anchored, yet unanchored
general 2021-06-22 17:36:46 Who is Joe
general 2021-06-22 17:38:45 I think we ask staff
general 2021-06-22 17:39:29 <@!335599526414909451> sorry to disturb you, but may I add a suggestion to <#507673335816126509> ?

creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:40:07 yeah
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:42:14 I'll correct myself, the only thing people upvote are motor lock builds that don't have exposed locks. nobody likes old fashioned shit.
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:44:31 I don't care how "low effort" it looks, I put my time and effort into her. I guess its just the ego that these people have. "oh it looks low effort so i will downvote it". this is exactly like the starscape discord server. the reason it got shut down is because the veteran players were extremely and indiscriminately toxic to the newer players of the community. the whole server is in read only
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:46:41 if something "sucks and is low effort" you are supposed to give Positive critical feedback to tell them how to improve, not bring down their self esteem by telling them their build is shit
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:48:44 i know my build is low quality, i have no idea how to improvise and improve on detail and quality of building. i never said my build was the best build ever. this "argument" is done. i do not wish to incite toxicity any further.
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:50:48 if its not good, Please tell me how i can further improve on detail in the future. i would absolutely be so grateful to know
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:53:58 ill take that into consideration thanks

creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:35:02 i asked for positive feedback not negative. please refer to the channel description before you are potentially escalated/striked/warned.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:37:31 I apologize for the inconvenience of being unproportionate, I myself have never been strong in proportioning objects in various shapes and sizes to scale exactly with a model.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:40:02 Thanks for the positive message. I will reshape the entire front of the ship over time, and work on enlargement of the turrets. curving the front tower was very difficult and in the future, I will experiment on angles, and curves. <@291284163762323457> I will look into more versions of 3d rendered models of ships.

creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:52:20 I appreciate the.. sorta positive message. Look I've never been much of a builder. IRL I work as a cook, not an architect. I only play games like these to pass time, or to enjoy spending time with family. I did not know that the guns were decommissioned. Yes, I do not like derogatory language unless used in a form of joke.
