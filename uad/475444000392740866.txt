help 2020-11-26 02:33:51 Would any of y'all ladies or gents happen to know some tips/ideas for how one might be able to make a starship hover in place? *using non-hover pads so it doesn't get affected by the ground, and in normal gravity because otherwise is a thing I'd prefer not to do.*
help 2020-11-26 03:07:42 Get it centered then use propulsion for up and down as well?
