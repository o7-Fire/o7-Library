general 2022-02-25 22:39:50 Why u ask?
general 2022-02-25 22:40:34 I'll ruin my reputation even more
general 2022-02-25 22:40:43 22:40 rn is GMT, 
A.K.A. Britain.
general 2022-02-26 11:17:30 Europe is highly overrated
general 2022-02-26 11:17:37 Too many different currencies
general 2022-02-26 11:18:10 the other half uses whatever the fuck they come up with
general 2022-02-26 11:18:28 It's annoying to keep changing
general 2022-02-26 11:18:46 No
general 2022-02-26 11:19:06 I'm saying that there's a lot of different currencies, which means a lot of searching for converters
and that europe is highly overrated
general 2022-02-26 11:19:30 can agree
general 2022-02-26 11:20:37 Britain got Churchill
And we got bombed
general 2022-02-26 11:20:48 USA got it lucky, they got barely anything
general 2022-02-26 11:20:59 Apart from a harbour, of course
Then again, that was a national tragedy
general 2022-02-26 11:21:21 Fine

general 2022-02-27 13:23:24 Cause thats how steak **can** look
general 2022-02-27 13:23:31 If that was chicken, i'd be concerned
general 2022-02-27 13:23:40 but it's steak, it can be that colour
general 2022-02-27 13:23:58 shush
general 2022-02-27 13:24:15 Are you having a stroke?

general 2022-02-27 13:55:42 T  r a n s
general 2022-02-27 13:55:53 embed fail
general 2022-02-27 13:55:54 laugh at this user
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 13:56:58 That's in the whole server
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 13:56:59 but wow
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 13:57:16 Oh now that's interesting
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 13:57:19 I've got 1,716
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 13:57:35 So what is unhidden with ur roles?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 17:57:19 Does bloxlink / whatever we use not already look at someone's account?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 17:57:36 And can it not see their age?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 17:57:57 I meant on the roblox account page
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 17:58:11 Can a bot check their age?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 17:58:17 Or is that something only they can see
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:04:00 Someone said "We should hack their PCs"
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:04:06 And i just wandered over to that thought
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:04:14 Of "Can we see their age externally?"
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:04:32 ^
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:05:03 I can send it to you personally.
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:05:12 That's a choice of mine, not you mini-modding
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:05:14 Give me one moment
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:05:51 My question was
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:06:07 Are we able to check their age externally?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:10 Math homework?
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:13 Now that's a new way
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:25 Voice proof requires an ID
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:30 Which usually means 16+ people
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:51 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:51 OHH
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:07:53 I'm dumb.
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:08:19 Rude
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:08:53 Because it's "off their platform"
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:09:11 Yet they'll complain if someone who uses it damages the companies reeputation Off platform
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:09:31 Like that one Roblox moderator that was posting publicly available NSFW stuff with them involved
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:09:37 They didn't care
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:09:49 But as-soon as someone pointed it out, they banned the person who pointed it out
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:10:08 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:10:22 That too, yup
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:11:01 They made no effort to hide it, And it was roblox who stepped in at the end
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:11:07 And didnt even do a decent job at it
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:12:17 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mr4a84prMc
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:12:21 Go take a look at that, covers those points just talked about
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:12:49 mhm
general 2022-03-03 18:30:41 It's an injector
general 2022-03-03 18:30:42 of course
general 2022-03-03 19:34:33 It's even worse when they do it in game.
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 19:36:01 Dear god, am I looking at?
bot-central 2022-03-03 19:36:41 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2022-03-14 20:31:18 Honestly, yeah
Expected a bit more chaos tbh
creations-chat 2022-03-25 19:16:10 <@!800270805409464320> 
just wondering

what is the giant floating pringles can meant to be?
creations-chat 2022-03-31 16:51:29 <@!796708501816213524> That's a **wheely** good circular frame
Surprised that it rolled so smoothly
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 09:09:44 Is it just me, or do creations in the airport setting spawn higher?
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 09:10:42 Was testing a way to get a building underground, and this didn't seem to work at all, with it spawning raised and not at floor level
