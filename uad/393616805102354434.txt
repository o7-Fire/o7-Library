The Tale of Udin Rendang (393616805102354434)
bug-reports 2019-02-10 11:03:06 When I play a VIP server, the big plane won't explode by a TNT. It's like not taking damage. Even if the PVP enabled. But if on the PVP public server, it can explode and my big plane destroyed. So i hope the VIP server bug is fixed.
