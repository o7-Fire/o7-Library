help 2019-12-07 21:29:50 Are you allowed to build the beach where D-Day took place. Just asking because a guy did, and I was thinking that people might get emotional or something.
help 2019-12-07 21:42:47 He only put down the guns on the beach, and of course the cover for the soldiers. But no actualy fighting. Like said, just the guns. Which he used in pvp if that changes anything

general 2019-12-08 16:00:36 Yea
general 2019-12-08 16:01:09 He passed away due to a seizure
general 2019-12-08 16:02:11 hmm. He also said "we ain't making it past 21" beaucse many rappers pass way before they pass the age 21. He didn't make it either
general 2019-12-08 16:02:24 He said that in a song called "legends"
general 2019-12-08 16:03:12 No idea
general 2019-12-08 16:03:52 um
general 2019-12-08 16:04:16 Yea
general 2019-12-08 16:05:48 The seizures can be very dangerous, especially if you don't have anyone with you
general 2019-12-08 16:08:50 Can't you start vomitting while having a seizure without hitting your head?

Not a lot of evidence I could get, but I did see his name tag from time to time while he was driving over me with the truck, had no time to take a screenshot, though. 
I tried to get him to confess that it was his truck, but I had no luck.

help 2020-03-31 18:25:10 Anyone know why my submarine keeps tipping to the right side when on water. When I test it's weight, it's even. How I test it? Ispam the flip button until I am quite a bit up in the air then drop it, if it tips to one side, that side weighs more
help 2020-03-31 18:25:57 Wym, I don't use those
