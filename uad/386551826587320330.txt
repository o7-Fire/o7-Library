plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:57:51 google it man
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:58:30 bananas can be big or small
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:58:54 like how big

plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:59:28 give me like 20 min
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:14:04 what are you trying to make it look like
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:14:43 what model
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:14:44 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:15:06 i think the front fenders look really good
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:15:20 the rear doesn't really look like what ur trying to achieve
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:04 I like the curve of the front fenders
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:27 but the rear of the car doesn't look the best
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:46 from the photo's you showed me
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:53 you need more curve in the back
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:17:22 also if you can maybe try to make the car a block or two longer so you can make it curvy
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:17:35 yea see its not a straight angle like that
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:18:17 it starts of flat the goes on starts declining
