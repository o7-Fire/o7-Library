general 2022-08-24 23:45:47 ...
general 2022-08-24 23:48:45 Yup.
general 2022-08-24 23:49:59 I saw that word for a split second.
general 2022-08-24 23:51:11 One word, thats all I saw, seems like the joke anyways.
general 2022-08-24 23:51:32 Okay I got it all.
general 2022-08-24 23:53:24 Someones going to become a bot.
general 2022-08-24 23:54:19 What?
general 2022-08-24 23:54:40 Does it look like Im a furry?
general 2022-08-24 23:56:31 If its the pfp, thats a silkwing from WoF, not a furry picture, a pfp thats considered a furry pfp in my fandom is the fur they add along with the pfp to indicate the furry intention, I have a dragon pfp, no furry things.

general 2022-08-25 00:11:05 Hello.
general 2022-08-25 00:11:23 Imma get popcorn for this.
general 2022-08-25 00:13:14 A bunch of kids talking normally I guess.
general 2022-08-25 00:13:36 Yeaaaaaaa
general 2022-08-25 00:14:49 Im sorry that I wasnt one of those people.
general 2022-08-25 00:15:37 MOST sane.
general 2022-08-25 00:16:08 Once again Im not a furry.
general 2022-08-25 00:17:13 Im just gonna eat my popcorn now, not get involved in this... thing.
general 2022-08-25 00:18:33 Mhm.
general 2022-08-25 00:18:58 You'll find alot of immaturity around in things like this.
general 2022-08-25 00:19:56 This is a live show, the best one to be entertained by.
general 2022-08-25 00:27:39 There is no limit to how bad it can be.
general 2022-08-25 00:33:39 Because they joined.
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 20:08:14 Anyone know where the shredders are? It seems they just dissapeared for me wherever I go.
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 23:20:10 Plane crazy is plane crazy, Im a carrier here... with 2 helis attacking a destroyer and a jupiter spaceship trying to land on my carrier, if I had perms for the images which I'll get eventually then I wouldve posted it.
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 05:20:31 Wow, haha.
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:56:32 Hello.
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:58:16 Anyone got any idea what happened?
bug-reports 2022-10-06 00:20:49 Sometimes my motor 2 on my guided missles or the currently building minions turns in a way that it spins and it doesnt move with the cursor then. Its not on toggle nor inverted or anything, just 10% with 1 speed. Fun to watch but not fun to use in pvp or testing upgrades.
bug-reports 2022-10-06 23:55:42 How about wait for a answer, eventually it'll come up. Saying dont play doesnt help either, just let someone that knows a fix to the bug or let them know they're fixing it if its at all being fixed or even known.
bug-reports 2022-10-07 00:10:52 How long has it been in between those four times and complants?
bug-reports 2022-10-07 00:55:06 Alright, sounds reasonable.
general 2022-10-09 09:08:14 [Insert hello here]
general 2022-10-09 09:09:03 Eh sleep whenever, its 4:08AM here.
general 2022-10-09 09:12:36 *Grabs popcorn*
general 2022-10-09 10:02:01 Ight Im back from smth what did I miss?
general 2022-10-09 10:15:17 Its 5:15AM over here lol.
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 07:37:42 Is void tech not allowed? Im trying to know because of some random dude talking about it.
help 2022-10-24 04:46:58 Is there a way to go to another pvp server? Everytime I try to go to another pvp server it only goes to the same server and I dont think theres a option to go to several servers of pvp as far as I know. There is a lagger that goes by the name of ChrisHadField0 and me and another person that recently friended me are trying to find another pvp server.
help 2022-10-25 05:53:18 Apparently my friend found a button at the flying island while we're streaming on youtube, wtf is call owner?
help 2022-10-25 06:17:08 I dont have their perspective in it, Im streaming in my side and he found it past the rick roll picture or smth inside one of the silo entrance like thingies. Apparently it also disappeared or smth. Im still waiting for another friend of mine to check if there is multiple buttons or just that one.

help 2022-10-25 14:29:07 Ikr doesn't sound right.
help 2022-10-25 14:46:10 I'll go look for it, I don't really know how to do timestamps and I ended up wasting 3 hours because I forgot to turn it public.
help 2022-10-25 14:55:00 2:47:36
help 2022-10-25 14:56:25 I dint have the slightest clue, I just managed to get it working with wing panels and some mechanic that allows you to do a steep turn under unknown conditions.
help 2022-10-25 14:58:53 He said it teleported away. I could try to get him to share his screen so that we can see the call owner button in settings he claims he got.
help 2022-10-25 14:59:17 We aren't in the same server though so it might be hard to do so.
help 2022-10-25 15:08:55 Lol
help 2022-11-13 20:30:32 Can anyone help me with my carrier plane? The controls on my carrier plane's manually set wing panels arent working and I been trying to find a loophole to this since this morning.
general 2022-11-13 20:36:03 I have come to see if the general chat is still a burning trashdump.
general 2022-11-13 20:36:40 Looks the same.
general 2022-11-13 20:37:26 ...
help 2022-11-13 20:44:56 My pilot seats arent working on anything that isnt my main build, they seem to only work on my propellars rn for some reason.
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 23:08:16 I might as well quit mobile. ðŸ’€
Can't even set all the buttons before my build hyper glitches its motors and flings me to death.
