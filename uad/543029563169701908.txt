general 2023-01-07 02:10:09 ok ive got one issue with this and while it is true, you cant really rely on this, if it were that easy nuclear fusion machines would be in our homes or atleast be used in greater sizes for everyone to use but it isnt that reliable given nuclear fusion has been done that few times, plus if you were to do this in a greater size you could potentially end up making something extemely dangerous causing the earth to maybe even collaps or be sucked by a new star you just made, or a black hole you just made, overall id rate this tutorial a 3/10, anyways, what would you rate this tutorial
general 2023-01-07 02:10:16 sorry for any spelling mistakes*
general 2023-01-07 02:10:53 ok
