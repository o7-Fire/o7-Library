general 2023-04-09 03:01:58 I guess I could delete it and just repost when I 100% finish it
general 2023-04-09 03:05:41 im reposting it when I finish it
help 2023-04-09 03:55:38 Does anyone know anything that would help with this problem? (I know the build is bad)
help 2023-04-09 04:01:04 when I try to move forward the tail spins and the whole aircraft turns when its not supposed to

help 2023-04-09 04:07:29 half of my builds are worse then it
help 2023-04-09 04:08:37 bro this is the best I could have done on it
help 2023-04-09 04:08:57 I don't know how to do freaking angle lock and piston lock and all of that stupid crap
help 2023-04-09 04:11:22 I have tried my best for 3 years on this game and almost all of my builds were either tuts, or pieces of crap, but now I actually like the way my builds look, and I just want to improve the one build I actually like
help 2023-04-09 04:13:02 I know probably 90% of motorlock
help 2023-04-09 04:13:18 this is one of the few of my better builds that doesn't have towers of it
help 2023-04-09 04:14:36 I would call going from this to that an improvement
help 2023-04-09 04:16:04 all I am saying is that I want to fix this stupid little problem and have a "crap" build that I like to use
help 2023-04-09 04:18:16 namnam jets are kinda mid but they are still better then that abomination I called an F-15

help 2023-04-09 04:34:50 if you want to see a packed tower
help 2023-04-09 04:35:01 you should have seen my old huey
help 2023-04-09 04:35:10 I made the tower like 10 high
help 2023-04-09 04:35:19 and then made the whole top of the lock
