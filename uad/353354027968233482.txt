help 2020-10-10 03:54:45 Is there a way to understand motor locking for builds? I wanna take my builds up a level.
bot-central 2020-10-23 07:26:55 ?rhelp
help 2020-11-26 06:05:14 I've been making a airship and when i fold it it freaks out and breaks. I've set the folding motor to 179, I've had a locking mechanism and still it freaked out. Any suggestions?
help 2020-11-26 06:11:24 It freaks out and slams itself into itself and gets stuck like this
help 2020-11-26 06:15:24 yeah
help 2020-11-26 06:18:48 yeah that fixed it, thanks everyone

creations-chat 2021-05-12 20:08:50 im sure its fine
help 2021-05-16 01:34:54 Is there a way to get the motors to stop swinging back and forth? The vehicle I'm making can't turn well when the wheels are flopping randomly disregarding button input. I've tried both motor 1 and 2 but it still is uncontrollable. Ping with response
help 2021-05-16 01:49:33 pain
help 2021-05-16 01:51:10 ill try it but I'm lacking space so it'll be hard to fit
help 2021-05-16 01:52:11 It's too big for something like that
help 2021-05-16 01:54:02 huh, never seen something like that. ill give it a try
help 2021-05-16 01:56:49 now it works well enough
help 2021-05-16 01:57:02 thanks <@!674434894616854548>
help 2021-05-16 01:59:49 yeah i added two more on each wheel and now its fairly stable
help 2021-05-16 02:01:05 Not sure how it works, but if it works it works. That and it fits without interfering.
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 21:21:58 is anyone else experiencing a lot of bouncing?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 21:22:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 21:23:39 no i mean like its rapidly shaking up and down like its never done before
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 21:24:06 is it a bug or something?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 21:24:17 because this didnt happen before
help 2021-06-04 21:56:43 Is there a way to stop the bouncing? It makes the vehicle unable to turn well.
help 2021-06-04 22:07:45 doesnt help, it still bounces and its supposed to be able to flex anyway
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:46:39 bruh  whats the point in making an announcement for an update that doesnt bring in anything new...
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:48:03 not new also
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:50:10 uhh?
general 2021-06-21 21:54:33 it doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:00:03 isnt the sprayers awful for pvp? i never used them it just what ive heard
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:03:21 its a limited time event for a reason, to be available for a limited time
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:04:28 ive missed older event but im not complaining, its my fault for not joining sooner
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:06:09 if theyre more unfortunate theyd have more to worry about than not having a ingame item

general 2021-06-22 02:57:54 how long does it usually take to get a rank? Im waiting for a support member to show up in the ticket chat and i dont want to be afk for it
general 2021-06-22 02:59:01 okay so i dont really have to worry as much, thanks
general 2021-06-22 03:00:07 i have all of that already, just waiting on someone from support
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:10:40 damn, exposed motorlock do be hindering the look of my build
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:13:37 
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:13:59 just that single thing bothers me
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:14:05 on the hood
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:15:10 im still a nooby on motorlocking so im not messing with the front end
general 2021-06-22 03:22:04 ...
general 2021-06-22 03:23:02 lol
general 2021-06-22 03:25:30 an original idea doesnt mean not low effort..
general 2021-06-22 03:26:08 i know you didnt
general 2021-06-22 03:26:57 gif fail
general 2021-06-22 03:27:49 this chat took a steep decline huh?
general 2021-06-22 03:28:53 he was beaned?
general 2021-06-22 03:29:03 damn, guess not
general 2021-06-22 03:29:47 and you're acting like this?
general 2021-06-22 03:31:36 we get it shut up already
general 2021-06-22 03:31:52 then dehydrate already jeez
general 2021-06-22 03:33:13 one word yet so powerful
help 2021-06-26 05:50:53 i think the half-blocks that are supposed to make the bottom of the plane are connecting with the blocks below, my guess is to have the guns and blocks connecting them a block lower and add an extra set of motor locks to bring it up. other than that idk whats causing that
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 06:11:57 what would be a good color for a suspension set up? i have the main body color and secondary color selected but im unsure what to do for suspension and under the body
help 2021-06-26 22:08:15 its falling out because the wheels cant turn with the tracks. have the two wheels connected like a solid axle and have a free spinning motor in the center.
help 2021-06-26 22:15:37 <@!371036190767448065> i made an example of what i was talking about because i kinda suck at explaining things
help 2021-06-26 22:20:56 its a motor 1 thats not powered, its in the middle so when the "axle" rotates the wheels stay aligned on the track.
help 2021-06-26 22:26:06 <@!371036190767448065>  I realized i made an error, the wheels were on wrong. they are corrected in this pic. also this is the rear view
help 2021-06-26 23:25:07 yeah
help 2021-06-26 23:27:19 
help 2021-06-26 23:27:32 
help 2021-06-27 00:13:26 I'm not sure how I should cover the suspension in the bed of the truck I'm working on. If I do a full liner of half blocks its too tall and looks weird. Any suggestions on how to handle the wheel well?
help 2021-06-27 00:34:09 nvm I got it
help 2021-06-27 15:19:32 No, it works just fine
help 2021-06-27 17:10:18 do what?
help 2021-06-27 18:08:35 Like in the picture as long as the wheels are close together on the same rail, along with the free spinning motor in the center of the wheels like before it should work fine. (The part holding the wheels is a 5x5 square with the wheels at each corner) The horizontal motors are there to allow the wheels to pivot to keep level with the ground on hilly parts.
help 2021-07-12 03:05:23 I made an 8x8 chassis but idk what body i should put on top
help 2021-07-12 03:13:16 i thought of adding a center steering hinge but id have to work around this and i didnt want to.
help 2021-07-12 03:17:46 what?
help 2021-07-12 03:33:22 why does it need a clock?
help 2021-07-12 05:29:42 it kinda is, but it was necessary to shorten the overall length
creations-chat 2021-08-05 23:15:06 lightish red
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:02:46 data will transfer over? pog
creations-chat 2021-11-08 03:44:43 I want some feedback if I can improve this 3 linkage suspension I made https://streamable.com/r8murb
creations-chat 2021-11-08 03:48:56 Damn how am I supposed to keep up with these talented builders üòî
creations-chat 2021-11-08 03:55:00 Yeah eventually I'm going to make it small enough for at least the 5x5 cylinder to be used as wheels. MAYBE even 3x3 but that might be pushing it but I won't know till I start shrinking it down.
creations-chat 2021-11-08 04:14:32 I made the previous design smaller and more compact-ish. (The motor-locking in the middle was because I was lazy and didn't want to delete a bunch of stuff <:trollface:775024642104229898>) https://streamable.com/av8nb3
creations-chat 2021-11-08 04:17:03 exposed motorlock <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2021-11-08 04:21:01 Maybe a chain of loose motors?
help 2021-11-10 00:12:32 Any idea on how to attach suspension onto this?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:19:20 I'm really hoping there's a ball hinge block in PC2 üôè
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:20:30 A piston that starts extended would also be really cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:25:25 like bullet drop?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:32:01 do we? idk I don't use the guns that much
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:41:03 Hopefully the map has places to use trucks at
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:42:18 It'd be cool if there is a rubber material that would be good for built wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:43:20 The fabric slips a lot for my use
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:44:04 yeah fabric wheels looks dumb
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:44:42 Oh and bigger cylinders would be mega pog
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:45:13 U rite
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:45:18 i forgor
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:48:01 Having a cylinder with a rounded edge would be cool so wheels dont look as weird
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:53:39 I was thinking something like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 00:55:04 Since it would be scale-able it could be used for more than just wheels too
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 23:08:17 is this based off anything?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 23:10:02 id say make the windshield and front more rounded but thats just a nitpick. looks good
