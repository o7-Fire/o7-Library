creations-chat 2023-06-05 06:57:44 i need more ideas for this "please give ideas but dont give me stupid ideas" (based off the Meteoro-class offshore patrol vessel)
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:10:01 good idea but for the cannon possibly not its more for pvp
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:15:04 I‚Äôll check that out tomorrow but I‚Äôll definitely try and add some detail to the bridge windows
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:19:53 Not much you can really do about the way mechs walk It mostly comes down to how fluidly the legs move and the surface area of the feet
the-dump 2023-06-05 08:46:56 
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:09:21 <:Shit:1096294444166291486>
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:12:51 Indeed
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 17:13:31 Someone should definitely make a cyclops from subnautica
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:15:02 Because shredders are idiotic and built by peoples who‚Äôs mother drank and smoke while they were in the womb
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:18:12 That doesn‚Äôt change the fact it‚Äôs a shredder
creations-chat 2023-06-05 19:13:26 do you know how to make those?
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:50:44 The goober 35 obviously
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:56:09 its literally 3 wide <:kalskull:993609557765005342>
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:59:25 show
creations-chat 2023-06-06 03:49:12 hence why i said the goober-35B
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:12:16 i actually chose the green for pvp. because i found out if you have that green underwater its almost invisble
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:21:14 but not underwater
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:29:31 well the green makes it blend into the flooring
creations-chat 2023-06-06 15:27:13 Old photos and I dont think the shaders work anymore
creations-chat 2023-06-06 15:30:29 Even up at 10 <:LoByronFacepalm:655977766587596811>

creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:37:34 <@860615820228427818> personally i think those headlights would be better as half down than full wedges

creations-chat 2023-06-09 19:10:56 yeah work on the sides and see if you can make them more curvy but overall its nice
creations-chat 2023-06-09 21:57:51 <@769319142146048001> is that a Indianapolis?
creations-chat 2023-06-09 22:17:04 W

plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:50:49 but idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:50:53 i dont think it would look that good
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:52:40 i was talking about for the ship man...
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:52:59 lmao you're good
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:53:33 they do work
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:53:42 they have ballast so they actually sink
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:53:56 wdym by motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:54:21 so like engines?
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:54:38 i mean its more for pvp but i could
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:54:48 its gonna have 4 big ass vls missiles
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:54:53 and its gonna kill people
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:54:56 its fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:55:06 15x3 missiles üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:55:24 the missles we got for it are cluster as well
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:55:42 well 1x1 is almost impossible
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:55:47 and 1x1's suck at water
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:55:51 so they kinda need to be x3
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:56:33 no lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:56:40 i havea  ss of them somewhere

plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:57:00 use
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:57:07 but imagine them as 15 long
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:57:37 but their not fitting inside of a ship
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:57:56 these will be
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:58:14 nah we doing by 15
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:58:18 it makes them more stable
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:58:26 and can handle higher speeds at water
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:58:30 and dont lag out and fall out the sky
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:58:36 thats what those tiny ones used to do
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 01:59:45 i got a friend with a flying porta potty
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 02:00:50
