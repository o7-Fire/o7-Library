plane-crazy 2022-02-18 18:03:28 didn't occur to me how oversized it was
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 18:04:59 damn it something is broken
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 18:08:08 
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 18:08:19 atleast it has working elevations

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 10:59:36 so i guess i'm not supposed to remove the connecting motor thing?
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 10:59:50 or is there a method to keep glue it together
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:00:04 where are the shipbuilders when i need em
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:05:05 right

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:14:41 
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:14:47 for now
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:18:13 never had the urge to build a ship until now so im dipping my head it with no knowledge
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:18:17 👍
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:19 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:22 and only now i've realized
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:25 it's too goddamn big
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:39 there's no more space
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:48 that's like 1/4th of the total length
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:14:25 gonna have to remake everything scaled down
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:16:03 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:16:09 gigantic
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:16:47 lass it's roblox
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:17:03 kitty
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:18:15 i feel like a takao-class ish turret would be easier to build in scale
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:18:29 does anyone know what im on about
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:19:16 grav slid
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:20:13 tf
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:20:13 oh that's supposed to be a 400z
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:24:28 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:24:33 turrets will be way easier to make
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:24:34 in scale
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:24:39 but that superstructre
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 08:20:22 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 08:20:24 now in a more
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 08:20:25 uh
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 08:20:27 managable
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 08:20:29 scale
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 10:20:24 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 10:20:39 now i have a  backup plan if the takao still turns out to be too goddamn long
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 10:24:00 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 10:24:03 please don't be oversized this time

plane-crazy 2022-03-15 10:32:04 it was originally yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 10:32:17 but i gave up on the superstructure so it's a makeshift Myoukou now
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 10:32:47 fixed the round glass thing since that was too big
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 10:35:37 mm vehicle with wrong turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 10:35:44 ~~straight out of wargaming~~
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 08:08:06

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:42:07 Hood and King George the V
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:43:04 While that's supposed to be
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:44:00 haven't got time to color the deck
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:44:17 tho I'm not sure what's the closest color i can use in roblox's brick color palette
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:46:41 the wooden deck color is something like
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 17:47:36 I tried putting straight up red just so it stands out
But I didn't end up liking it
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:13:01 yeah ig
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:13:08 as long as it's not copying the example
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:23:11 playns

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:26:29 the Do-31
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:27:32 late 60s vtol pinocchio
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:27:37 would be pretty unique to build
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:29:23 Haven't seen anyone try it so would be pretty cool
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:29:52 It's weirdness could get people's eyes on you
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:30:41 Yeah rest of it's pretty simple

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:03:16 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:07:24 
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:07:34 turret is a bit wider than it should be
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:08:53 cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:09:29 it's not a pocket battleship like graf spee
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:09:33 most cruisers are like that
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:09:38 
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:09:59 already as small as i can get
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:12:08 think roblox crashed
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:12:10 ola
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:12:39 oh well that means i have to redo the bow shape either way

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:25:31 long fuckin
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:25:33 way to go

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:29:55 
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:30:02 yes i haven't finished it either
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:30:09 it's missing like 70% of the hull
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:30:18 i like doing the deck first
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:32:28 damn he really dropped the 1h 4w
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:34:08 tnt
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:34:21 wait is tnt still immune to rockets
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:34:56 my tank uses it
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:35:01 but it's from like
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:35:05 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:35:19 haven't seen that in a while
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 09:38:12 lol this thing is gonna dwarf some battleships
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 10:21:31 like 5 and a half
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 10:22:19 i take that back there was just some guy with a small bismarck

plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:16:45 still needs like 3 more folmds
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:29:05 It's like 1/4 done
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:29:34 hull can sit down and go last
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 06:36:22 no hull yed

plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:26:57 
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:27:02 i stopped this for a while
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:27:06 finally did the aft turrets
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:27:21 
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:32:14 they all turn and elevate
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:54:18 you can see
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:54:22 that it is not done
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:55:11 too bad
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:55:20 i calculated the height already
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:55:26 so it could go last
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:57:09 now to make the stern
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 05:57:11 but i am incredibly lazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:03:11 ah who needs a stern anyway
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:03:14 
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:11:59 you don't know how many people i've met that calls it a battleship

plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:18:10 well i guess that explains it
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:25:00 the lighter grey looks kinda better tbh
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 06:27:09 saaaaab
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 02:33:54

plane-crazy 2022-04-30 14:08:51 wuh
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:40:00 naval 🥺
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:40:27 the opposite for me lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:40:38 i can't do coastal
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:40:44 but destroyers and cruisers
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:41:13 not high in the tech tree enough for battleships
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:01:03 did you fold your ship today
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:02:13 sounds like a weird itsult
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:02:18 fridget
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:02:28 frigate + midget
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:09:59 feels like every fighter in the server starts building bombs on the spot when i spawn the ship
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:12:00 finding an interesting server is way harder than 2020
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:12:06 it feels like
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:12:09 or just not the hour
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:18:29 hell os
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:20:52 let me
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:21:00 
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:21:15 crazy majesty
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:23:08 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:44:13 you can always try
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:44:19 waiting in queue for half an hour
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:46:17 arise
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 17:58:44 Run
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:01:46 i wonder how many buttons will be on my mobile screen
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:01:53 this is before it was done
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:01:55 there's more controls now
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:02:55 im running out of mkfd keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:03:42 i should probably use supers
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:05:31 true
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:06:34 i was suprised 4 of them was able to move the thing
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:06:47 honestly thought they were gonna be decor
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:07:21 the shadows look like oil leak sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 18:07:33 im just afking the game
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:54:21 It you cut a hole in the bottom it would just make the deck float
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:54:51 or even the hull's wall
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:55:21 plane curazy anything will float
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:55:34 it you want something to sink other than with ballasts
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:55:37 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:56:13 hoh
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:56:27 you could make a ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:56:41 with a *really* tall conning tower
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:57:04 and then stack the inside with 10 block density ballasts
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:57:09 Would make the ship top heavy
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:57:12 And it'll capsize
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:57:41 actually no it would still float upside down
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:59:06 bring ship to pvp
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:59:19 even a 1x1 block would float
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:59:33 
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 08:59:42 yea still floats sideways
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:01:20 I could probably shoot down a ww2 style plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:01:35 granted it doesn't have 2000 rockets hidden under it
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:02:02 but most people i see have modern jets anyway
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:02:19 I got attacked by a fucking mech once
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:02:53 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:03:05 you saw the split second message
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:03:37 Torpedo them back
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:04:06 jea
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:04:19 you could kill a plane that crashed under water
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:04:25 On water*
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:05:07 that would be funy
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:05:38 Here aa nug
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:05:55 a Myōkō class
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:05:58 Heavy cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:06:23 the ō is the same as ou
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:06:41 wt naval
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:06:59 even if you damage a plane enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:07:08 it will just respawn and get another bomb
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:07:38 So you don't get the joy of seeing it go down
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:08:34 shredders destroy me the fastest tbh
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:09:00 Because they could just fly thru the bridge and stab me
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:09:06 and it'll be all over
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:09:43 Show ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:10:10 ah
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:10:25 I finished the cruiser like this week

plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:12:18 I could probably nae nae a battleship
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:12:21 Haha torpedo

plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:16:07 so no solo tankin
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:16:23 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:17:00 mtc3 is a bit close range
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:17:24 you could pull 1km shots in mtc1 and Syrian bitch game
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:18:08 well i did manage to get a kilometer shot across the road near A
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:18:39 I want to make an Italian cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:18:53 the zaras have ugly turrets so no

plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:24:38 
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:24:56 in my time away with a shitty laptop i tried to make a prototype turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:25:01 for a future ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:25:07 it's 
shit
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:25:33 might actually try to understand what motorlock is if i end up going thru with this

plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:39:19 I'll be away for more probably lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:40:25 The top superfiring turret has somewhat of a late tiger II shape
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:40:34 which I've seen done here
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:43:04 yesj
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 10:39:27 What is it based off
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:40:43 
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:40:51 flaking
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:41:00 it is no better than throwing rocks at the planes
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:41:20 should probably set it lower?
bot-central 2022-05-04 20:43:12 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:07:49 😳
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:07:57 I should try
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:08:15 Might make something like
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:09:30 Oh wait does it have elevation?
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:09:44 o
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 12:09:48 unfortinate
bot-central 2022-05-05 12:15:47 pocky cross
general 2022-05-05 13:10:21 that's
general 2022-05-05 13:10:24 it's roblox
general 2022-05-05 13:10:48 i don't think anyone have made actual car AI in roblox
general 2022-05-05 13:10:59 under than ones that go in a straight line
general 2022-05-05 13:11:11 eh might be plausible
general 2022-05-05 13:11:23 but you have to account for roblox's performance
general 2022-05-05 13:11:44 in progress
general 2022-05-05 13:12:07 yes but like
general 2022-05-05 13:12:23 a ps2 from the 2000s would probably run better than roblox
general 2022-05-05 13:13:00 why super detailed driving games like horizon fail
general 2022-05-05 13:13:07 since no one could run it
general 2022-05-05 13:14:47 no i am underestimating roblox
general 2022-05-05 13:15:12 that wasn't like 
a serious statement
general 2022-05-05 13:15:32 i mean
general 2022-05-05 13:15:35 tell me about it
general 2022-05-05 13:17:12 plymouth
general 2022-05-05 13:17:22 or perhaps it's a dart?
general 2022-05-05 13:17:50 it's a destroyer
general 2022-05-05 13:18:56 nice pink haired "girl pfp
general 2022-05-05 13:19:32 oh isn't that the guy that runs wangan runners
general 2022-05-05 13:19:40 or whatever the game now is called
general 2022-05-05 13:19:49 o
general 2022-05-05 13:20:46 everytime i hear about wangan runners i remember my fellow mrt mod who got demoted for talking shit in their server
general 2022-05-05 13:21:23 xqc
general 2022-05-05 13:22:28 pensive
general 2022-05-05 13:23:29 plane crazy ai but it's just random people's builds
general 2022-05-05 13:24:17 it should be completely random
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:14:47 can i see the mustang 😳
general 2022-05-06 13:51:34 ganged by "a"

general 2022-05-06 13:57:20 More of a jag guy
general 2022-05-06 13:58:01 I doubt the moderation here cares about it
general 2022-05-06 13:58:48 so a JDM amg is invalid
general 2022-05-06 14:11:29 M4 ?
general 2022-05-06 14:12:12 The dealership stats are broken
general 2022-05-06 14:12:15 Don't look at those

general 2022-05-11 12:32:52 original is still very good but
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 00:54:10 That's
Sharp
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:13:06 you could always rebuild it
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:13:48 i build my thing without
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:14:05 😃
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:14:15 you could make a submarine bow without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:14:32 im assuming it's supposed to be a modern sub?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:14:36 oh
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:14:39 ded
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:06 modern submarines have a blunt bow
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:07 that
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:12 's all im gonna say
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:36 i don't have a sub
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:51 only a cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:55 no i've seen it before
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:15:58 ww2 esque bow
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 01:16:18 it's not so different from a traditional ship bow
general 2022-05-12 13:48:41 most of them are named after mountains or prefectures
general 2022-05-12 13:49:09 im not sure
general 2022-05-12 13:49:21 well
general 2022-05-12 13:49:30 there's plenty but im not sure which to chose

general 2022-05-12 13:51:00 o

general 2022-05-12 14:05:10 was thinking about getting UAD
general 2022-05-12 14:05:18 significantly more expensive
general 2022-05-12 14:05:43 the thing that's kinda boring about admiral dreadnoughts is that you have to use existing superstructures
general 2022-05-12 14:07:00 oh lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 11:00:52 ooh those are snow launchers i think?

plane-crazy 2022-08-24 09:09:28

plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:43:17 Only problem is

plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:43:23 Since the guns are so close together
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:44:28 Yea I still have no idea how motorlock works
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:44:38 I know it's probably simple but
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:45:16 Noi
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:45:23 I quit the game for 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:45:31 Have no idea what is going on
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:46:00 this how I be when someone teaches me to use a technique
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:47:30 My old and currently only finished build
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 02:50:20

general 2022-11-21 04:50:48 🥛
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 05:54:25 what's your method of dealing with top heaviness in a ship
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 05:55:45 ha! done that
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 05:56:51 im making HMS london when i get home
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 05:56:59 a short hull with tall freeboard, and a narrow beam
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 05:57:04 doesn't sound too promising
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:52:13 I forgot if the half blocks are lighter or not
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:52:52 Though I think you can make ballast blocks lighter ?
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:53:12 by decreasing it's density
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:27 I used ballast on my last heavy cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:35 I meant uhh
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:38 Helium*
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:46 which I wanted to remove soon
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:55:23 Eh nothing wrong with using helium I guess?
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:55:40 Can I see them
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:56:51 Sweet
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:57:13 I mostly make heavy gun cruisers
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:57:22 well, one finished and a few others I abandoned
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:57:59 Oh wow that block number humbled me
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:58:26 
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:59:45 Interior too
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:59:47 Neat

plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:20:28 hi i am someone who is completely clueless
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:20:41 about motorlock

plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:23:37 i just need to move this floating piece
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:23:39 one block down
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:23:52 simple enough right?
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:24:07 so how do i motorlock that
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:50:20 well i guess i figured something out
