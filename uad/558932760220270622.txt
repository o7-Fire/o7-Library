creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:08:07 Motorlock, trails, control surfaces, text objects, motor 2s
creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:10:12 The motor2s that control them are inside the jet
creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:12:51 thanks
creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:25:01 Why are the engines brown?
creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:28:53 Should have made it way darker
creations-chat 2022-10-02 06:35:19 Motorlock
creations-chat 2022-10-02 10:37:01 I fixed the motorlock sticking out the back
(i can't fix the motor2s for the canards because there's not enough space for text blocks)

Can't really do anything about the lines on the wings though, since they are the fins of the missiles

creations-chat 2022-10-02 12:14:25 Yes but the canards will not work since they are directly attached to the heads

creations-chat 2022-10-16 09:46:01 looks like 2 doritos covered in milk
creations-chat 2022-10-16 11:05:24 use signs instead of trails for your rotors
make it ice or metal material so it doesn't have the wood texture
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:09:36 hey sorry for the ping but are you able to do something about the track sticking out?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:10:03 Alr
