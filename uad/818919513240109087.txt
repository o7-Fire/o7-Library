general 2022-06-16 07:21:17 hello
general 2022-06-16 07:21:56 i am creating an f 4 phantom it is coming out better than i expected but i need help for the wings
general 2022-06-16 07:22:05 they are difficult for me
general 2022-06-16 07:22:28 I don't know whether to use 1x1 or 1x2
general 2022-06-16 07:23:23 And how many can I use?
general 2022-06-16 07:23:39 I think back I have to use some 2x2
general 2022-06-16 07:24:28 the last wings i made were from a su 27 and i was not happy with the result, they look like a russian fighter but some parts were different
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 17:15:26 Does anyone know how to make the wings of the phantom?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 17:15:38 how many delta could i use

plane-crazy 2022-08-22 00:36:19 Does anyone know if I can put blocks inside the motor lock?
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 00:36:38 I mean if I can transfer it using blocks so that it is not seen
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 06:22:15 Hey nothing happens if I'm creating a c 130 but it resembles the sticknub although I don't base it on or copy it
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 06:32:59 they can tell me to copy
creations-chat 2022-08-24 05:34:06 One question, are you going to expand the map in the near future?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 05:37:20 I think he's been working on it for a few years
creations-chat 2022-08-24 06:16:21 I was trying to create the hercules recently
creations-chat 2022-08-24 06:20:03 it smells like you are interested in knowing the information

general 2022-10-22 19:32:30 Hello
general 2022-10-22 19:34:08 can the motor lock tower go through anything?
general 2022-10-22 19:34:43 I have not had much interest in building those things when it comes to building but when I build some I see that they go through things
general 2022-10-22 19:35:12 I mean the motor lock tower a normal motor lock goes down but if there is a block it collides the motor lock tower does not

general 2022-10-22 19:41:36 Have you fixed the bug of painting a text?
general 2022-10-22 19:42:09 hello
general 2022-10-22 19:42:11 gringos
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:48:27 What do you think of this prototype of c 130 hercules that could change it?
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:50:48 That's what I work on based on the nose of your Hercules
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:07:58 What could I do to improve it? I don't know how to use angle lock or anything like that, although I learn more and more how I could improve it. It's not a c 130j, it's a c 130H.
creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:18:27 I tried that but it is very high if it is already high it would be higher the truth is I tried to do the best I could I was working on it I saw the original model and a small part of the wheel is hidden
creations-chat 2022-10-30 03:57:32 does it really look good? what could change?
creations-chat 2022-10-30 04:00:06 I could not do more there was the most real nose that remained among a lot of failed nosesI could not do more there was the most real nose that remained among a lot of failed noses something else?
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 00:42:07 Can someone pass me a code for a higher red color?
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 00:42:30 if they know any color code for red high
general 2022-11-02 00:43:05 Does anyone have a dark red color code?
creations-chat 2022-11-02 04:19:49 a 3x3 interior is good for a c 130?
creations-chat 2022-11-03 01:03:39 One question Does the Creator not have time to fix the bug when you want to paint a text? either he does not have time or it is very complex to fix that
creations-chat 2022-11-03 01:06:52 I forgot to say it, forgive my ignorance, they already told me that twice, well, how long do you think it will take to fix that problem? Roblox doesn't even care about big mistakes... I wonder why not continue with the first version? upgrade it imagine seeing what you have built in Plane crazy on a new Plane crazy map in the same game
creations-chat 2022-11-04 04:11:56 r
general 2022-11-08 06:12:08 Today I went to plane crazy and I learned something I suppose that a motor without power does not have any force you can move it it is like an endless valve and using motor lock it can be adjusted to some shapes the angle lock has to do with that?
creations-chat 2022-11-08 23:29:57 Someone tell me what this is?
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:13:32 is rather an experiment and if they are the super hornet since yesterday I have worked with that I will not make the plane it was only a prototype
general 2022-11-13 18:44:35 Would a c 130 hercules without windows look good?
general 2022-11-13 18:45:34 why
general 2022-11-13 18:46:11 I'm building it but if I use the location of the real windows I don't know if it would look good
general 2022-11-13 18:46:39 I don't trust much yet I've already seen it but I would also like your opinions
general 2022-11-13 18:48:04 is a 3x3 space decent?
general 2022-11-13 18:48:20 that is the space inside the plane
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:16:23 It is in white because it is a Prototype for some reason I like to leave it blank Although I lose more since it will take longer to paint it
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:18:40 Does the window look good there? The window does not let me continue with the project a week ago due to doubts
general 2022-11-18 16:13:21 A question nothing related to plane crazy. Does your country have war bands?
general 2022-11-18 16:15:28 had?
general 2022-11-18 16:17:30 What do you understand by war bands?
general 2022-11-18 16:19:16 Yes but they are not used in times of war I doubt it is a weapon
general 2022-11-18 16:19:46 You don't need to be at war to hear them coming
general 2022-11-18 16:20:04 that's why I doubt it
general 2022-11-18 16:20:30 They are used by the armies perhaps to indicate something
general 2022-11-18 16:20:54 Normals just don't need a war to hear it coming.
general 2022-11-18 16:24:16 I just heard a go by on my street
general 2022-11-18 16:25:11 No
general 2022-11-18 16:25:21 They use bugles and drums
general 2022-11-18 16:26:50 And they are shaped like bugles
general 2022-11-18 16:27:08 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-18 16:27:45 For every school there is one
general 2022-11-18 16:28:46 they are air instruments
general 2022-11-18 16:29:24 These fried foods are not sold here
general 2022-11-18 16:30:37 Rick can fix it?
general 2022-11-18 16:31:10 Other people told me that was Roblox's fault.
general 2022-11-18 16:31:36 So that bug will stay for an indefinite time
general 2022-11-18 16:32:17 maddatak has more games, plane crazy, it's just one of the many that he has, I doubt he's going to do something with plane crazy
general 2022-11-18 16:33:32 Maybe Plane crazy is a little collaboration between Rickje and maddatak that maddatak is not very interested in
general 2022-11-18 16:33:56 maddatak has more famous things that you should be more interested in
general 2022-11-18 16:34:37 Will the game run out of updates?
general 2022-11-18 16:35:59 When you have planes and are in pvp, you put +8 rockets on them
general 2022-11-18 16:36:13 and shoot them at the same time?
general 2022-11-18 16:36:59 They should set limits or at least not let everyone throw themselves at the same time
general 2022-11-18 16:37:23 I'm sure those people only think of saying win
general 2022-11-18 16:37:53 I'm not going to say that plane crazy should be a realistic game but they put rockets everywhere on their plane
general 2022-11-18 16:38:24 I also see cubes with wheels with many rockets in the bases
general 2022-11-18 16:39:08 What I'm getting at is that they put that everywhere
general 2022-11-18 16:39:46 The normal build system becomes obsolete
general 2022-11-18 16:42:10 a 3x3 space is good for the cargo bay of a c 130
general 2022-11-18 16:42:38 3x5
general 2022-11-18 16:42:49 3x3 with seats
general 2022-11-18 16:43:06 3x5 
with other details
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:11:52 What could this be? Is this happening right now? Are they following each other? Is it a formation?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:12:57 Is it real that you can have a vip server for free?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:14:41 how can i get a rank
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:15:27 <@217336009455566848> 
sorry to wake you
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:15:48 yes i did
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:17:45 I am working on it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:18:07 is it detailed?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:18:15 what space do you have
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:27:28 Does the f 4 currently fly?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:27:51 I am surprised to see that the Il 78 is still flying
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:28:00 28*
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:28:47 Does the F 5 still fly?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:29:05 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:29:54 Which is better the F 4 or the F 5?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:30:56 The f 5 costs almost the same
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:31:14 I like the F4 better in many ways
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:31:24 maybe it's more powerful
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:32:16 The f 4 has more capacity
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:32:56 I don't know why they kept buying the f 5 and retired to the f 4
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:33:14 Maybe the US blocked the sales of the F 4
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:34:07 And which do you think is better, the Kfir or the f 5?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:35:28 My country could have the Kfir but the US blocked it for having the J79 engine
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:36:30 And why did he fly in Colombia and he flew in the US Navy?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:37:21 
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:41:22 The mi 17 can have machine guns
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:08:13 I'm sorry that the door affected this plane a lot in terms of cosmetics, there will only be access through the loading ramp
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:09:09 If you don't have a door, you don't need a window, right?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:09:18 Not yet
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:10:34 He told me that the window of the door
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:10:45 how not to remember
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:10:55 The window is next to
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:11:11 I have a prototype with window it doesn't change much
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:15:40 Hey
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:17:42 I don't have one defined since I see several and they all have that window there, even one from the inside
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:18:02 
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:18:14 It's not the one I'm looking at but it also has the window there
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:18:27 C
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:18:53 C 130H
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:19:00 C 130K
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:19:26 My country does not even have the H, it only has the K
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:20:10 but the c 130H and C 130K don't change much
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:20:36 It is specialized for the RAF
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:20:47 The J is longer
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:21:23 The RAF retired all its C 130K I suppose but in my country it continues to fly because it is from the third world
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:22:25 So what do you think? Do I leave that window there?
bot-central 2022-11-19 21:01:38 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:10:10 Where could I get a model of the interior of the C 130 Hercules but from the side, not from the back?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:10:59 I found nothing
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:11:21 Do you know any model from the side, not from the back of the plane?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:26:02 It is the number of windows that the real plane has
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:26:26 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:26:52 What the color looks like will be changed soon it is blank because it is experimental
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:30:00 Where?
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:32:04 I don't know if I should keep the window in the middle The real plane has that many windows.
general 2022-11-19 21:33:03 test
general 2022-11-19 21:34:05 Did you say the landing gear is low?
general 2022-11-19 21:34:31 If so, you couldn't do more, that's the real size
general 2022-11-19 21:34:49 Not exactly but it's the closest
general 2022-11-19 21:35:02 ?
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:41:31 The windows don't look bad?
