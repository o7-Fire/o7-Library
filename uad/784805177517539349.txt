general 2021-02-28 10:33:01 This is different.
general 2021-02-28 10:33:13 I was trying to fix my keyboard.
general 2021-02-28 10:33:23 It's broken sometimes.
general 2021-02-28 10:33:32 Yes.
general 2021-02-28 10:33:41 I will do it in DMs now.
general 2021-02-28 10:33:51 Because here, it's not well received.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:06 As far as I know, h is a key.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:18 So by pressing it, I check if it works.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:21 Correctly.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:32 With rare to no issues.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:41 But it was already fixed.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:46 Seemingly.
general 2021-02-28 10:34:52 Yes.
general 2021-02-28 10:35:03 Am not noob.
general 2021-02-28 10:35:30 What's this?
general 2021-02-28 10:35:38 What was that?
general 2021-02-28 10:35:42 No.
general 2021-02-28 10:35:47 Disaster.
general 2021-02-28 10:35:57 No.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:02 Yes, but no.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:11 That guy.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:28 I'm just trying to type.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:33 In here.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:39 Can I name a country?
general 2021-02-28 10:36:42 Please.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:52 I need to tell you about a country.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:55 From Europe.
general 2021-02-28 10:36:57 Now.
general 2021-02-28 10:37:08 Am not saying something else.
general 2021-02-28 10:37:13 Am not noob.
general 2021-02-28 10:37:46 We should not talk about restricted things.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:05 Hey, Mega, can I talk about my country in Europe?
general 2021-02-28 10:38:20 Answer now.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:23 Please.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:29 Eh.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:33 This is getting long.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:38 For like, no reason.
general 2021-02-28 10:38:45 Alright, thanks.*
general 2021-02-28 10:38:50 My country is Romania.
general 2021-02-28 10:39:00 In the South East of Central Europe.
general 2021-02-28 10:39:11 It has a neo-latin language.
general 2021-02-28 10:39:34 And has been first declared independence in 1877.
general 2021-02-28 10:39:43 And went to war against the ottomans.
general 2021-02-28 10:39:48 And won.
general 2021-02-28 10:40:04 So.
general 2021-02-28 10:40:17 In 1881 the kingdom of Romania was established.
general 2021-02-28 10:40:52 With Karl Eitel Friedrich Zephyrinus Ludwig von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, crowen as king Carol I of Romania.
general 2021-02-28 10:41:05 He ruled the country for 48 years.
general 2021-02-28 10:41:13 Until he died in 1914.
general 2021-02-28 10:41:25 It's fricking german.
general 2021-02-28 10:41:43 Romania had german kings.*
general 2021-02-28 10:41:52 That's why the name is complicated.
general 2021-02-28 10:42:05 He spammed h.
general 2021-02-28 10:42:08 Ban him.
general 2021-02-28 10:42:31 It was a reference of course.
general 2021-02-28 10:42:41 It's called h.
general 2021-02-28 10:42:48 No.
bot-central 2021-02-28 10:43:05 !rank
general 2021-02-28 10:43:25 What was that?
general 2021-02-28 10:43:35 Oh, I see.
general 2021-02-28 10:43:43 Don't spam.
general 2021-02-28 10:43:46 So anyways.
general 2021-02-28 10:43:52 Back to Romania.
general 2021-02-28 10:44:22 In 1914 it was part of the Triple allience, with Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy.
general 2021-02-28 10:44:40 But when the war started, it stayed neutral.
general 2021-02-28 10:45:01 Because this coalition had defensive purposes.
general 2021-02-28 10:45:19 Also, the new king was Ferdinand I, nephew of Carol I.
general 2021-02-28 10:45:33 Hmm.
general 2021-02-28 10:45:49 It seems this is getting stranger in time.
general 2021-02-28 10:45:52 Get it?
general 2021-02-28 10:45:55 No?
general 2021-02-28 10:45:58 Bruh.
general 2021-02-28 10:46:17 I'm trying to type fast.
general 2021-02-28 10:46:28 Alright.
general 2021-02-28 10:46:33 I've been mistaken.
general 2021-02-28 10:46:37 Indeed.
general 2021-02-28 10:46:55 I will of course respect your wishes, good sir.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:07 What's that?
general 2021-02-28 10:47:18 I know.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:25 But what's it about?
general 2021-02-28 10:47:32 Some wierd thing.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:35 Moving around.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:38 And dancing.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:42 In several ways.
general 2021-02-28 10:47:48 Faster and faster.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:00 Of course it's gonna die at some point in time.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:09 Eh.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:11 Hmm.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:12 Haha.*

general 2021-02-28 10:48:33 Alright.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:37 Calm down.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:51 Am I not allowed to use upper cases and periods though?
general 2021-02-28 10:48:56 I think I am.
general 2021-02-28 10:48:59 Anyways.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:14 Ok, ok.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:19 Don't worry about it.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:30 Well, yes.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:35 It should be.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:53 It may have expired already.
general 2021-02-28 10:49:58 Or it may have not.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:05 It depends.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:17 Many concepts and ideas are only relative.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:29 Permanecncy is relative.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:34 Of course.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:42 No.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:46 Yes actually.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:49 but not really.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:53 I mean.
general 2021-02-28 10:50:57 It's complicated.
general 2021-02-28 10:51:12 Well, in that case, I don't know.
general 2021-02-28 10:51:15 Because, yeah.
general 2021-02-28 10:51:38 But what about learning some physics now?$
general 2021-02-28 10:52:53 And getting fair economic deals.
general 2021-02-28 10:53:02 Wanna learn a foreign langauage?
general 2021-02-28 10:53:06 Anyone?
general 2021-02-28 10:53:15 It may help you later in life.
general 2021-02-28 10:53:29 Seems like this place is deserted right now.

creations-chat 2021-03-02 17:57:35 Guys, can I show you a dornier do 17m?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:00:42 <@!527653676022628353> I don't. It's the m version of the do 17, lol.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:05:04 What do you think about this dornier?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:07:41 Is my dornier good enough for you?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:18:40 Lol, I didn't make that version. It's a special romanian one.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:24:35 Ok, but do you like this NMS Elisabeta romanian cruiser? If this 3593 blocks detailed ship is "too small" for you, I think  we don't use the same metric system.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:27:35 I can't count, but here I'm on the deck, you can make a comparaison.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:29:57 It's about that, but the real thing wasn't gigantic, it's pre ww1. I used 1.5 blocks for 1 m on the ship. I got a friend who made an incredible Ratte, but in smaller scale. Do you only like size? In that case, build a giant block, and post it.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:32:23 <@!718006867808485447> Well that means most voters on this server are dumb.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:37:00 Well for example, here I made a small but detailed 500+ U-I class submarine from the K.u.K. navy. The real thing was a coastal U-boat and was only 30 bloody meters long. If I'd make it bigger, it would be unrealistic. But I understand that only size, and not historical accuracy metter for votes.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:41:57 Do you like this one?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:48:23 Eh, ok? Is it good than?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:50:49 It was a psychology experiment.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:53:16 Yes, I wanted to see how dumb people were.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:55:48 Bruh, I wanted to post a submarine but, ok. This server is so toxic anyways.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:58:20 Do you at least know if I'll be blacklisted forever on this account <@!690967945165275216> ?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:02:07 <@!707133341454958604> Thanks for blacklisting me. You got all the compliments.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:05:38 Bruh. I'm new here, how can I possibly know who can blacklist? But I'm leaving anyway, here people only care about the size of builds and this server is so toxic. Just get over it.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:10:26 Bruh, I'm not NeW oN tHe GaMe, I'm new on the disc. I got a lot of detailed accurate fucking builds, don't trust me? Join me on the bloody game.

general 2021-03-05 19:18:32 Looks like grammar is seen as torture, around here.
general 2021-03-05 19:19:43 It depends on one's taste for esthetic beauty in writing.
general 2021-03-05 19:20:00 Which is of course, relative.

general 2021-03-07 08:07:46 Poor kid... I don't think we have the same definition of grammar and, unfortunately for you, mine is the average one.
general 2021-03-07 08:08:27 You should get the Nobel Prize, to be honest.
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:09:50 
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:38:40 No problam.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:27:05 Guys, I got a problem. I got a 10200 blocks pre-dreadnought that lacks an entire server when spawning. Is there a possibility to minimize the lag, or something?
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:57:36 NSFW.
help 2021-03-08 20:08:35 Greetings, I got a significant problem. I can't spawn my 10200 blocks pre-dreadnought, because every time I try, the whole server freezes and many people disconnect. I've seen that recently, other players with large creations experienced the same thing, so could someone fix the game? It was working before.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:11:55 Has anyone else noticed, that the game gets so laggy when you spawn large builds?
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:12:01 Recently.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:15:59 <@!527653676022628353> Well, I spawned a 10200 blocks pre-dreadnought battleship and it crashed my friend's game multiple times, along with freezing the server.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:16:15 But this sucks.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 20:16:26 I can't spawn it, without getting him mad at me.

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:09:17 Eh.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:09:34 Just because I'm blacklisted, but ok.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:10:59 <@!551806781609869313> It's an old ship. It has a pre-dreadnought design. Search it on the internet, you're gonna see, it is accurate.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:11:13 Thanks. <@!251880826386513924>
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:22:19 Hmm ok.

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:27:42 This picture is better.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:28:18 Not to mention that it has ~1000 blocks only from minor exterior details that you can't notice from pictures.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:28:37 And around 3000 blocks of interior.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:29:40 What? It has 10200 bloody blocks.

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:34:32 <@!790732709559271444>
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:34:57 No.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:06 The inseide has an interior.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:38 Around 2.75 plots.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:53 Around that.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:25 Well, it's another kind of ship.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:37:12 But I reproduced many details in the interior.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:37:28 It depends to literally anyone's personal tastes.

general 2021-03-22 21:07:52 <@!790732709559271444> They were strong. In WW1 they deployed 13 million troops.
general 2021-03-22 21:08:05 But everyone except a few conutries was against them.
general 2021-03-22 21:08:14 No.
general 2021-03-22 21:08:36 Actually yes, China is stronger than the USA now, the americans lost most of their advantage.
general 2021-03-22 21:08:46 China has the largest industry.

general 2021-03-22 21:10:20 And in WW2, they were rules by dumb austrian painter.

general 2021-03-22 21:10:42 Look at Barbarossa.
general 2021-03-22 21:11:05 Going to land war against Russia, on it's territory, is suicide.

general 2021-03-22 21:11:41 Maybe.
general 2021-03-22 21:11:56 But Hirohito would've started a war in the Pacific anyway.

creations-chat 2021-12-05 14:47:40 <@!799381636407099483> Shut it, noob. You think your first ever ship will beat mine, whatever. Come on, build something better than this in 8 days. Forgot to mention, must be 9000 blocks or more. Go ahead.

help 2022-02-17 18:26:35 Greetings, fellow players. It has come to my attention that locked motors will no longer teleport in Plane Crazy 2. I was wondering if that means that motorlock as we use it now will still work.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 21:24:08 DM me if you wanna see a rocket.
