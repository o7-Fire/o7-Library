The Tale of Klit_Kommander_Kyle (618288433814568974)
general 2020-05-31 19:02:25 Sooooo
general 2020-05-31 19:02:43 Is there anyway the Dev can make the allowed altitude higher?
general 2020-05-31 19:03:05 My Spaceship gets so high that I glitch out and can't land
general 2020-05-31 19:03:30 Yeeeeah I use helium
general 2020-05-31 19:04:00 Would not using helium help?
general 2020-05-31 19:04:40 I mean, I've got a LOT of helium in this thing too
general 2020-05-31 19:05:37 I'll delete all my helium and see what happens
general 2020-05-31 19:05:50 Anyone playing Plane Crazy rn?
general 2020-05-31 19:06:53 Well thats kinda what I want is for it to take longer cause rn I glitch out before I even get a chance to disconnect, release parachutes, etc.
general 2020-05-31 19:08:30 I was getting over 50,000 mph in less than 2 minutes, I have 4 huge rocket engines, 4 regular, and 8 super, 4 for acending, 4 for descending
general 2020-05-31 19:09:00 It doesnt show an actual unit of measurement sooooo
general 2020-05-31 19:09:08 I just kinda assumed
general 2020-05-31 19:09:12 Good to know
general 2020-05-31 19:09:40 Imperial>metric
general 2020-05-31 19:10:38 Degrees F üòâ
general 2020-05-31 19:11:58 Lol I literally wish the US would just go completely to metric tho. Due to this fucking country I'm only proficient in Imperial
general 2020-05-31 19:12:07 For most things
general 2020-05-31 19:12:24 Especially in distance because I went to school for Machining
general 2020-05-31 19:13:33 Yeah, I like that
general 2020-05-31 19:13:57 Then theres like, 24.5mm or some bullshit like that in an Inch
general 2020-05-31 19:14:53 Yeah tell me about it m8
general 2020-05-31 19:43:07 Possible reasons for a disconnector not working?
general 2020-05-31 20:11:31 That stuff is disgusting
general 2020-05-31 20:13:32 Baha Blast man
general 2020-05-31 20:13:38 Thats where its at
general 2020-05-31 20:15:59 Got my space ship working flawlessly now
general 2020-05-31 20:16:07 And it lands so smoothly
general 2020-05-31 20:17:04 How do I get roles?
general 2020-05-31 21:01:32 wot
general 2020-05-31 21:01:53 That is not plane crazy unless you have a ton of like, DLCs or whatever
general 2020-05-31 21:04:31 Oh, ok
general 2020-05-31 21:04:46 I was basically asking if that ss was Plane Crazy
general 2020-05-31 21:43:40 I had the perfect spaceship and the game autosaved over it ;-;
general 2020-05-31 23:40:42 Finally rebuilt my space shuttle. This ones a little better actually because it separates in 3 different stages
general 2020-06-01 17:38:28 Do you need to pay robux to use glass?
general 2020-06-01 17:38:52 I can't seem to find glass beams or anything
general 2020-06-01 17:39:16 oh
general 2020-06-01 17:39:23 crap
general 2020-06-01 17:39:27 /oh ok
general 2020-06-01 17:40:17 I'm new to the whole game. I had an account years ago that has since been hacked
general 2020-06-01 17:40:37 Like, it was so long ago that my favorite game was call of robloxia roblox at war
general 2020-06-01 17:41:21 But I'm following a tutorial. Is there a standard length for beams or are different types of beams different lengths?
general 2020-06-01 17:43:30 Yessir
general 2020-06-01 18:20:16 Any VTOL techs on here?
general 2020-06-01 18:21:20 I followed a VTOL tutorial but It's unstable
general 2020-06-01 18:22:32 <@!429826358827417601> You ingame?
general 2020-06-01 18:23:22 I was following a VTOL tutorial from dec 2018 and it's unstable but I'm wondering if theres any changes I can make to it to stabilize it
general 2020-06-01 18:23:38 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCFDOE5SZvM
general 2020-06-01 18:24:22 I can't even get off the ground with it
general 2020-06-01 18:24:47 Literally my spaceship I completely designed myself works better than this piece of garbage
general 2020-06-01 18:25:38 rn this VTOL is basically just a showpiece cause I do think it looks cool
general 2020-06-01 18:26:13 Think not teaching Newton Law is bad. I went to a god damn Christian highschool
general 2020-06-01 18:27:39 Would physics include the uses of springs, gears, pivots, etc. or is that just the topic of basic mechanical engineering?
general 2020-06-01 18:28:54 Imagine.. Guns being illegal
general 2020-06-01 18:29:25 This is why I love America sm ‚ù§Ô∏è
general 2020-06-01 18:30:38 Who here isn't from the US?
general 2020-06-01 18:31:24 Very much so but I'm from a rural area of it
general 2020-06-01 18:31:44 This is why I love America
general 2020-06-01 18:32:09 I have 2 of those
general 2020-06-01 18:32:16 Plus a 12 gauge
general 2020-06-01 18:32:47 One in .308 and the other in .223
general 2020-06-01 18:32:59 That one in the pic is .308
general 2020-06-01 18:33:09 Ban guns? I dont think so
general 2020-06-01 18:33:22 The .223 is just plain ol .223/5.56x45
general 2020-06-01 18:33:36 But, our school system is absolutely fucked
general 2020-06-01 18:33:57 I use mine for deer sooo
general 2020-06-01 18:34:45 Some parts of the US just kinda get along better when the citizens are armed. Like the rural part that I'm in called Maine
general 2020-06-01 18:35:39 I'm just fucked cause I have a lot of conspiracies after dropping a shit-ton of acid in college
general 2020-06-01 18:37:35 Most parts of the US do need stricter gun laws
general 2020-06-01 18:38:41 But my area, nah. Murders are few and far between and 9 time outta 10 it doesnt involve a gun
general 2020-06-01 18:41:01 America isn't that bad if you stay out of the cities
general 2020-06-01 18:41:30 Or Maine. Which is basically south Canada
general 2020-06-01 18:41:54 It basically is the UK cause they're still under the crown
general 2020-06-01 18:43:09 Kanto. Are you in the US?
general 2020-06-01 18:43:17 Ah
general 2020-06-01 18:43:26 Is literally anyone here in the US?
general 2020-06-01 18:43:48 Oh god
general 2020-06-01 18:43:51 Yeah
general 2020-06-01 18:43:53 No
general 2020-06-01 18:44:09 Cygnus, go to like, rural oregon or Washington
general 2020-06-01 18:44:26 Ew
general 2020-06-01 18:44:44 Maine is where its at ‚ù§Ô∏è born and raised here, never leaving
general 2020-06-01 18:45:14 22_Syn. Where you from?
general 2020-06-01 18:47:01 Jackman, Maine ‚ù§Ô∏è
general 2020-06-01 18:47:19 Literally Radiator Springs from Cars irl
general 2020-06-01 18:48:33 I don't actually live here unfortunately but this is my dream town to live in. This is the most densely populated part of Jackman, Maine (downtown)
general 2020-06-02 17:34:14 Are cones a thing?
general 2020-06-02 17:34:51 Dang
general 2020-06-02 17:35:31 We should have cones
general 2020-06-02 17:36:00 There are those?
general 2020-06-02 17:36:22 I just want something on top of my fuel tanks for my space shuttle
general 2020-06-06 07:08:00 Anyone wanna guess what I'm working on?
general 2020-06-06 07:08:17 Amen
general 2020-06-06 07:11:57 huh?
general 2020-06-06 07:12:48 It's kinda skeletonized rn. I fatten it up with half blocks
general 2020-06-06 15:06:22 A10 Warthog is done, gotta find a way to hide super rockets on it tho cause the 2 large jet engines in NOT enough
general 2020-06-06 15:16:38 What ya'll think?
general 2020-06-06 15:23:49 Its my first model plane built from scratch (not by tutorial)
general 2020-06-06 15:26:28 Like, I just looked at a picture of an A10 and recreated it as much as I could
general 2020-06-06 15:27:04 Ye
general 2020-06-06 15:28:12 Got it flying ok now
general 2020-06-06 15:28:34 Had to add some super rockets inside it
general 2020-06-06 15:32:25 ?
general 2020-06-06 15:32:57 but I don't think A10s are supposed to be fast
general 2020-06-06 17:49:09 I use Gyazo
general 2020-06-06 18:23:28 Can a launch pad be used for the rocket scientist rank?
general 2020-06-06 18:26:26 I use disconnectors on the launch pad to build up momentum for lift off. That sux
general 2020-06-06 18:28:02 I don't need it. I was able to launch without it
general 2020-06-06 18:29:25 I do believe my Rocket Ship would qualify for Rank 3 Rocket scientist
general 2020-06-06 19:12:49 Just got my first rank üôÇ
creations-chat 2020-06-06 21:18:21 Kinda disappointed at the flying cars rating üò¢ kinda a dumb idea but it works mint
creations-chat 2020-06-07 00:41:09 Ouch. both creations ratings tanked
general 2020-06-07 01:07:28 uh oh üòõ game shutdown
general 2020-06-07 01:08:24 Its back already
general 2020-06-07 01:08:49 The 20th of June I'll officially be legal to drink
general 2020-06-07 01:09:00 Sweet
general 2020-06-07 01:10:59 How tf can you get cameras to stay put?
creations-chat 2020-06-07 15:01:50 My A10 still has a negative rating üò¢
general 2021-08-31 15:22:02 .
general 2021-10-16 21:11:34 Soooo whats the deal with disconnectors lately? Can't get them to work
general 2021-10-16 21:12:33 Yall, why ain't disconnectors working?
general 2021-10-16 21:12:56 They always worked for me before
general 2021-10-16 21:13:31 I hit the letter I set it for and nothing happens
general 2021-10-16 21:13:39 false welding?
general 2021-10-16 21:14:47 Uh. How would I correctly place a disconnector then?
general 2021-10-16 21:16:04 I haven't played for several months but I've got a reasonable amount of experience with the game
general 2021-10-16 21:19:18 Wait a minute, do I need the disconnector on an anchor block? I don't remember
general 2021-10-16 21:22:17 I got it to work but it will only let me use the default "G"
