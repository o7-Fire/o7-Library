general 2020-01-04 23:25:26 yall, is it possible to make a functioning rocket ship in plane crazy?
general 2020-01-04 23:25:44 it is? cause my rocket cant fly straight
general 2020-01-04 23:26:02 you guys have interesting reasons of why things dont work
general 2020-01-04 23:26:15 then again, this whole controversy is stopping human progress anyway
general 2020-01-04 23:26:20 so you guys actually arent wrong
general 2020-01-04 23:26:36 i dont know how to use stabilizers cause i never saw them in tutorial lol
general 2020-01-04 23:26:47 also when i add wings to my rocket ship, the center of lift never appears
general 2020-01-04 23:26:59 oh
general 2020-01-04 23:27:54 what is drag and where can i find gyros
general 2020-01-04 23:28:12 and also the wings just fall off, they dont stick to the rocket
general 2020-01-04 23:28:19 <@!163143541160148992> makes sense.
general 2020-01-04 23:28:49 <@!224513422161739776> yess
general 2020-01-04 23:29:00 why not?
general 2020-01-04 23:29:08 hmm
general 2020-01-04 23:29:12 so i HAVE to make a square rocket?
general 2020-01-04 23:29:32 i am confusion.
general 2020-01-04 23:29:35 and woah thats epic
general 2020-01-04 23:29:55 true,
general 2020-01-04 23:30:13 the geometrical shape of wedges allows for infinitely complex possibilities
general 2020-01-04 23:31:02 theres all that stuff u guys are making
general 2020-01-04 23:31:13 meanwhile, heres what i made:
general 2020-01-04 23:31:25 im very not pro
general 2020-01-04 23:36:54 is there a wedge that can fit in this type of corner?
general 2020-01-04 23:37:02 s h ut
general 2020-01-04 23:37:24 <@!163143541160148992> which triangle wedge is it?
general 2020-01-04 23:37:29 ok
general 2020-01-04 23:37:50 epic, thanks
general 2020-01-04 23:38:47 is there a way to just copy a whole set of blocks instead of having to place a whole ton of them?
general 2020-01-04 23:39:04 a  n g e r
general 2020-01-04 23:39:14 i aint filling my rocket one block at a time
general 2020-01-04 23:39:20 i might as well leave it hollow
general 2020-01-04 23:39:30 yes im aware there is a double space
general 2020-01-04 23:39:44 ok
general 2020-01-04 23:46:52 nothing like watching an expertly built and properly functioning rocket fly into the sky while suffering with not even making ur rocket work properly or look nice
general 2020-01-04 23:50:30 and uh my rocket seems to be strange, the moment i turned on my rocket engines, they started screaming HARbERGbERuGHg bg
general 2020-01-04 23:51:57 welp im stumped, i just dont know how to make the rockets work.
general 2020-01-04 23:52:41 wow. epic.
general 2020-01-04 23:53:05 a shame my rocket couldnt work properly so i could bask in the glory of my luck
general 2020-01-05 00:09:30 i cant go a day without breakfast without fainting
the-dump 2020-01-05 00:36:25 in this universe, u get oreos in your stockings and u dunk coal in milk
general 2020-01-05 21:36:59 just found a cheat for keeping my rocket straight
general 2020-01-05 21:37:17 when my rocket starts tilting to the side, i click flip, problem solved
general 2020-01-13 21:26:18 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
general 2020-01-15 20:33:45 uh yall im in america land and im not necessarily sure if i updated in time
