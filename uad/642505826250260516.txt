general 2022-03-07 04:34:04 Hello everyone, I'm new to Plane Crazy, and joined the server to ask questions and all of that sort in means of improving! Is there anything in particular I should know early on before I start messing up my builds due to lack of the knowledge of it? Thanks! :D
general 2022-03-07 04:34:50 Alrighty, I'll check out motorlock now, thanks everyone!
general 2022-03-07 04:35:00 Thank you!
general 2022-03-07 04:37:00 Hmm, I'm mostly thinking about tanks at the moment, I'll probably get into mechs when I have more knowledge about joint mechanics!
