general 2022-03-08 01:26:10 Camera keybinds are reset!
general 2022-03-08 01:27:06 I have a build that has like 500 cameras..
general 2022-03-08 01:27:28 Welp time to get back to re placing all my cameras
general 2022-03-08 01:28:19 Yep
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:28:36 Cameras are set back to deafult keybinds on saved builds
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:28:58 Eg: Was set to v to activate and is now set back to 1
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:30:06 This is a issue multiple people are having
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:33:38 happens every time a build is loaded even if the keybind is changed and the build re-saved
general 2022-03-08 01:38:36 Do I ping someone in <#498473314445033472> ? I found a bug that's actually pretty bad xd
general 2022-03-08 01:39:27 Cameras are set back to default keybinds
general 2022-03-08 01:39:38 glitch happens whenever the build is loaded
general 2022-03-08 01:39:45 even if re-saved
general 2022-03-08 01:39:51 YEP
general 2022-03-08 01:40:31 Look in ya dm's
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:01:46 wdym? I said cameras are set back to default keybinds on all saved builds (even if re-saved with the correct keybinds)

bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:22:46 Just one problem. I need cameras to hold together most of my builds
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:23:45 i press 1 to activate something and I get put in one of my 500 cameras on my build
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:24:44 and deactivates the other thing
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:25:23 It's not really a problem for me but a lot of people are complaining about it since I mentioned it xd
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:26:44 yep... and they are all set back to 1
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:27:02 I bind all cameras to \ so I don't activate them
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:27:34 The problem is every build I load (or save) is just set back to the default keybind on them
bug-reports 2022-03-08 02:31:27 As shown here
bug-reports 2022-03-08 03:25:24 Idk if he's seen it but I mentioned it
