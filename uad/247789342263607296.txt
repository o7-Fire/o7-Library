general 2022-10-08 20:40:30 I baited him into saying hes 3 years old
general 2022-10-08 20:40:31 lmaooo
general 2022-10-08 20:56:09 what happened to MrDoge
general 2022-10-08 20:56:44 Amazing,
general 2022-10-08 20:56:56 Ima go into PVP and see if an entire server can takedown my tank plane
general 2022-10-08 20:57:18 That plane is tougher than The Rock's forehead
general 2022-10-08 22:04:11 What about a flying 5x5 box?
general 2022-10-08 22:04:19 well 5x5x3
general 2022-10-08 22:04:44 I mean , if you can make that fly then id say its pretty impressive
general 2022-10-09 16:18:42 Btw the blue sphere doesnt show up when i place down wing panels
general 2022-10-09 16:18:48 is it broken
general 2022-10-09 16:18:56 or has it been removed
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:19:27 Its not but it looks pretty nice
general 2022-10-09 16:19:33 no u
general 2022-10-09 16:20:02 Racist much?
general 2022-10-09 16:20:24 nah im not in first person, but it happens to me pretty often,
general 2022-10-09 16:20:36 I remember it showing up a while back but not anymore
general 2022-10-09 16:20:47 It shows up in some old planes that i have saved but not in any new ones
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:37:59 Anyone have an idea for a compact ejector seat?
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:38:16 Good idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:49:44 extremely ^
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:49:59 my first build took me a good 4 hours
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:50:07 Terrible plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:50:20 well all my planes are terrible so meh
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:50:46 I want an ejection seat!
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:51:09 one that isnt just a detachable seat sticking out of the plane with a parachute on its back
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:54:00 Yeah, when just take out any mechanism you need and build your own
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:54:21 whats the heaviest block
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:54:30 I need to bring the balance down a bit but i dont have much space
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:58:05 Its almost... PLANE CRAZY!
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 16:58:09 That was bad
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 21:48:13 Has anyone ever actually made a good working ship in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:06:16 Ive spent the last 40 min trying to figure out a full controled missle i can drop, i just realized that i cant control it without crashing my plane because its controlled with my mouse aswell
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:08:08 Ill either switch how my plane is controlled or ill just make the missile be contolled with arrows, although if i do that its really sensitive so i cant control it properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:11:01 every server
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:11:03 game update
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:11:53 I swear to god if i lose my missile i will commit war crimes
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:12:16 Every time i refresh the page the game drops by around 200 players
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:12:27 its gone from almost 3k to 1.6k
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:14:04 It was 1.6k like 3 min ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 23:14:16 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:20:28 Anyone got an idea on how to lock down a structure to the ground?
I've got a few missiles that I launch one at a time, but when I control one it moves all the other ones and pushes the whole structure forwards, any way to lock it in place so it won't slide around
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:21:10 Actually I might make the takeoff vertical and use ballast blocks to stop it from going up
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:21:15 ty
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:21:40 and that would make it so I can have even more because it would be far more space efficient
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:23:11 I wish there was a way to copy and paste builds with all the different controls, It's gonna be such a pain to have to change the detonation button on each of the 5 tnt for the 6ish missiles I'm going to have
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:23:48 wait what
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:23:54 you can do that?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:24:41 Ive wasted so much time changing all of them individually
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:24:55 I need some sleep, ill finish it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:25:16 also anyone know why sometimes the mouse control on a missile is inverted and sometimes not?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:26:01 I was messing around with only one missile and it just kept switching back and forth whenever I reset it without me changing anything in it
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:27:23 it can be really annoying to not know if the controls with be inverted or not so you have a 50% chance of crashing the missile into the ground right after takeoff
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 00:29:11 a lot smoother,
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:41:00 Why does the disconnector block not work half the time?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:42:58 Like im actually sitting here trying to detach a missile and send it flying but it doesnt work!
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:43:02 Ridiculous
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:45:37 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:45:57 No but actually why the hell does it not want to detach?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:46:52 This is weird, whatever
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:52:45 Hold on lemme join the game rq
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:54:06 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:54:10 ^
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:55:37 there are 2 anchor blocks keeping the platform in place but still
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:56:08 Even on the one with multiple missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:58:04 Now the missiles wont rotate!
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:58:07 This is just ridiculous
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 07:59:08 Im just gonna play smthing else
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:06:08 Disconnector,
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:06:22 That wasnt the issue tho, it can detatch with the camera just fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:06:38 now it just wont go side to side, it only goes up and down
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:06:42 It cant spin around
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:07:12 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:07:25 I havent had a single lag spike
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:27:21 Ive fixed that, Now it refuses to turn, it only goes up or down
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:27:54 if it gets pushed aside with something then it stays in that position and i can only go up or down, turning my mouse side to side does nothing
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:28:48 Im joining the game to see if i can fix it
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:31:35 This is still broken
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:31:36 oh my god
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:10:17 Anyone got a large bomber or plane i can test my missile on?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:50:16 Im actually fucking dumb
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:50:29 I was trying to test my explosive rocket, on a non PVP server
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:51:59 Why do my missiles not do dmg?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:52:24 I just rammed into this random with a TNT rocket that explodes on impact, it exploded but didnt dmg them at all
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:59:22 so impact missiles are pointless?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 10:59:35 Unless the target is not moving at all?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 17:48:52 can you whitelist someone to build with you?
events-chat 2022-10-12 17:57:25 Best missile competition ^
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:01:15 Is it possible to have a missile that automatically locks on to something?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:01:56 Either by the vehicle being close to you, being close to your mouse (would be amazing) or some other way,
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:02:34 Well to be fair, ive seen some really advanced stuff
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:03:32 Also, i have an issue with my missile causing no dmg to anything around
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:03:51 yeah, without it being in PVP it wouldnt explode innit?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:04:40 I had my missile planted right beneath a plane as it spawned, i detonated it as it started moving and the plane took no DMG
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:04:52 Well its front landing gear fell off
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:05:25 I have it on 12 blast radius, 2500 blast pressure 100 impact speed and its got on impact enabled
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:06:40 even when i hit a gigantic warship that wasnt moving at all, it destroyed maybe 4/5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:08:41 I can even detonate it with F right before impact and it still does little to no dmg
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:10:22 Is it like 3 seconds behind?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:10:41 Because it seems unless im landed ontop of a non moving vehicle i do no dmg
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:10:47 200 ms
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:17:10 So i need to detonate a bit after hitting them?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:52:08 wait so since materials have different masses
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:52:20 do they also have different durabilities?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:56:21 would be nice if for example wood would start to burn and it would spread from lava shooters or whatever they are called
