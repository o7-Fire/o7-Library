creations-chat 2020-12-02 03:20:58 should I post on creation?
creations-chat 2020-12-02 03:45:06 maybe, I noticed some problems with it though, and I feel like posting something that I know that isn't a 90%-100% replica would just not be the best thing and I wouldn't really be happy posting it knowing that I could've done better if you want to know problems, the front is way to long, and wedged. It should be about 2-3 blocks shorter and the front part of the hood should be curved
