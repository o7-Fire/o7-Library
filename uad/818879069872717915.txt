bug-reports 2022-06-10 20:00:41 the bug is basically when you fire the game's rockets they just disappear, this happened in several accounts of mine including
 the current one: (BRALU17) and in all my constructions, when it is stopped it is possible to shoot but not in motion, I play on the notebook and I have no idea how to solve it, this video shows the bug: https://www.youtube. com/watch?v=Tnv2UdYOu_Y&t=3s (not my video) and I don't have screenshots about it
