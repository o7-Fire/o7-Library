creations-chat 2021-07-02 15:02:27 look at the channel info
creations-chat 2021-07-02 15:22:20 they can't stand when minecraft builds get more upvotes than high effort ones
creations-chat 2021-07-02 15:44:59 ok what

creations-chat 2021-07-14 16:57:48 petition to make <#384021699466756107>-arguments channel
creations-chat 2021-07-14 16:59:49 it won't be <#504436696021204992>  without at least 1 argument every day
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:03:25 up at home:
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:11:26 and we're giving them attention. so just shrug it off
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:19:56 the fact that everyone doesn't think it's a joke except you means your sense of humor is messed up
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:25:16 "i ran out of valid arguments, therefore i shall resort to calling other people ugly"
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:27:21 he's getting desperate
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:31:42 nah he's baiting a reaction
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:34:13 wow funny joke <:pain:644301805534183464><:pain:644301805534183464><:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2021-08-05 17:46:48 engine looks like it's too low
creations-chat 2021-08-05 17:50:32 but 737-800 engines aren't that big compared to the plane fuselage
it'll probably look nicer if the size gets reduced by a bit
creations-chat 2021-08-05 17:54:22 i like the logo attempt but it just looks like someone spilled blue paint on the front half of the plane
creations-chat 2021-08-05 17:58:02 maybe remove it altogether? i'm pretty sure someone will know it's ryanair just but the blue and yellow color scheme alone. plus it'll look cleaner. just an opinion
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:01:10 i'm not good with planes so idk but for the eiffel tower, the legs should extend out a bit more like on the real thing
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:03:16 people here have high standards when it comes to creations
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:10:43 people like builds with good attention to detail and builds that closely resemble the real thing is what i mean
creations-chat 2021-08-09 15:38:57 why are there propellers on the wings that's cursed
creations-chat 2021-08-09 15:54:22 butthurt?
