general 2021-07-16 11:25:33 Why? Is it against the rules?
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:27:13 This sounds more against the rules than sending a few anime emojis but okay ^^
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:27:22 Moderator doesn't follow the rules I guess???
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:27:45 <@!308156968550268928>
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:28:02 Yes cry about it
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:28:23 Yes I'm an alt with Nitro
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:29:08 Do not harrass, bully, threaten or berate other members
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:29:58 A little trolling can be bullying
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:30:29 <:woah:814562211212165130>
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:30:35 <:NekoPfft:814562282590830642>
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:31:44 Damn now you're bullying me for my name? How low of you
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:32:21 Trolling is 70% of the times bullying
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:33:26 Because if you show your literal id in the store they know just as much already. If you order something from a site they know your address. So why wouldn't I share some basic things about me?
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:33:47 Are you fr this idiotic?
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:34:16 Yes. You live in another country. Even more of a reason why it's less dangerous for any of you to know
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:34:53 Ah yes my address will be leaked just because they know my age, gender, and birthday ^^
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:35:00 Oh and country
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:35:07 Which has 9M people in it
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:35:34 Who said James is my real name?
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:35:55 I never said it's my **real** name
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:36:18 What's my real name then?
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:36:26 Nope
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:36:55 Nah my real name is Vitor
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:36:58 Idc if you know it
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:37:55 Toxic and childish
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:38:04 People are too scared to even share their age online
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:38:05 Like wtf
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:38:31 Omg I'm so toxic omg omg
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:39:01 At least I don't cry about telling an age or name
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:39:56 Dw. I doubt anyone would even want you if they knew your age. But I assume you're under 16
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:41:19 I've joined many Roblox communities before but this is by far one of the most toxic, childish, rude, and stupid communities I've seen so far
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:41:28 Actually it's more stupid than toxic
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:41:45 Lol
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:41:56 At least I'm not addicted to some plane game
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:43:56 Anyway, I got what I came here for
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:43:59 So I'm leaving now
the-dump 2021-07-16 11:44:08 Bye bye <:angelRrampeace:823970292639727707>
