general 2021-12-05 18:07:22 Ah jees my game has crashed.<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2021-12-05 18:09:15 That is from bandai?
general 2021-12-05 18:10:47 Burh, i played tamiya brand
general 2021-12-05 18:11:11 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-12-05 18:12:10 I know you can!. But the budget
general 2021-12-05 18:12:12 Sad
general 2021-12-05 18:12:57 For me. It's very expansive
general 2021-12-05 18:13:34 One of the good things about bandai is that it has already been painted.
general 2021-12-05 18:13:52 But Tamiya, you have to paint it yourself.
general 2021-12-05 18:14:36 I used my all budget like umm maybe $147.65
general 2021-12-05 18:14:43 To make that tirpitz model
general 2021-12-05 18:16:54 Honestly, I'd rather buy HMS Warspite, but tamiya doesn't sell it. (That is my favorite BB)
general 2021-12-05 18:17:33 Burh
general 2021-12-05 18:20:33 I was able to walk there and buy because it was very close to my house.  But the only downfall is ||I don't have any money. ||
general 2021-12-05 18:22:36 But now I'm going to stop playing the model for a while because now I want a graphics card.
general 2021-12-05 18:22:41 Can you believe me that I am currently using an onboard graphics card?
general 2021-12-05 18:22:50 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
