general 2022-12-08 20:09:43 hello
general 2022-12-08 20:09:44 :p
general 2022-12-08 20:09:47 yea
general 2022-12-08 20:09:58 remembered by few 🫡
general 2022-12-08 20:10:11 yea i just came back
general 2022-12-08 20:10:38 i wanna make another super big build or something using motor lock
general 2022-12-08 20:10:41 gotta figure out how it works tho
general 2022-12-08 20:11:55 the ship i built was pinned in creations in 2019 but never got to HOF but everything else pinned did
general 2022-12-08 20:11:58 wouldve had master role
general 2022-12-08 20:12:00 but nop
general 2022-12-08 20:13:08 hof requirements were still ridiculous back then lol
general 2022-12-08 20:13:09 its just
general 2022-12-08 20:13:13 builds that are in now
general 2022-12-08 20:13:15 werent really possible
general 2022-12-08 20:13:16 detail wise
general 2022-12-08 20:14:40 im concerned how that last build in <#627195143040139264> even fit in the plot
general 2022-12-08 20:14:43 that 13k block space ship
general 2022-12-08 20:15:50 not really about knowing the locks its using them in a compact space cramming as much detail and functions as possible
general 2022-12-08 20:16:24 well, the problem is they are server destroyers lol
general 2022-12-08 20:16:30 back when i made my ship it would destroy the server
general 2022-12-08 20:16:32 its gotten better now
general 2022-12-08 20:16:36 but even planes and super rockets
general 2022-12-08 20:16:45 i made a bad 747 in 2019 that couldnt even take off due to the lag
general 2022-12-08 20:16:49 now it flys around the map no problem
general 2022-12-08 20:17:04 yea i know i was in the server when vip empire and the other guys were launching it
general 2022-12-08 20:22:30 helicopters are one of the hardest things to build

general 2022-12-16 02:36:25 that long ago
general 2022-12-16 02:36:36 someone probably did that already
general 2022-12-16 02:37:03 i dont remember enough to do all that
general 2022-12-16 02:37:11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCnZpTi43iM&ab_channel=LuchtLeiderNederland
general 2022-12-16 02:37:18 they done made a multi part iceberg
general 2022-12-16 02:37:19 that is true
general 2022-12-16 02:37:40 make up some BS like server destroyer then toss in pictures of your 4 part carrier in there
general 2022-12-16 02:37:50 the punisher v2

general 2022-12-16 04:53:02 wish i had 7.63 MYRS
general 2022-12-16 04:57:57 just use a EU vpn and create a binance wallet from there
general 2022-12-16 04:58:03 should bypass it just fine
general 2022-12-16 04:58:15 like a dif chrome browser then get a browser vpn eg zenmate
general 2022-12-16 04:58:32 ohh yeah to link bank i thought ur just doing only crypto
general 2022-12-16 04:58:45 u can just withdraw from binance into coinbase or another selling wallet in ur country ig?
general 2022-12-16 04:58:58 or just have a holding wallet like exodus if ur doing only crypto
bot-central 2022-12-16 05:02:04 -servers
general 2022-12-16 16:29:32 <@447221768520859659> im concerned what that looks like unfolded, great build
general 2022-12-16 16:31:37 does that actually fly
general 2022-12-16 16:31:40 or does it just nuke ur game

general 2022-12-16 16:33:47 try reposting with images attached, not embedding links
general 2022-12-16 16:33:51 that should work
general 2022-12-16 16:34:07 just download the images and send them with all ur info
general 2022-12-16 16:34:11 instead of the links
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:35:42 not everyone has a good pc to run max graphics and lower graphics hides some of the flaws aswell

general 2022-12-17 05:35:19 suspension is annoying and tricky for most people that dont do car builds

general 2022-12-18 03:15:52 Hello
general 2022-12-18 03:18:08 👋
general 2022-12-18 03:18:26 oh yeah ik
general 2022-12-18 03:18:40 good days passed
general 2022-12-18 03:19:18 i still like playing the game on occasion
general 2022-12-18 03:20:12 thats why i wanted pc2 so bad
general 2022-12-18 03:20:16 but its just not there sadly
general 2022-12-18 03:20:23 been waiting many years
general 2022-12-18 03:20:59 on god
general 2022-12-18 03:21:02 atleast rick is getting help now
general 2022-12-18 03:21:06 its hard being a solo dev like that
general 2022-12-18 03:21:23 prob just needs community for smaller things
general 2022-12-18 03:21:28 rick is capable of developing the main shell
general 2022-12-18 03:21:35 oh yeah
general 2022-12-18 03:21:37 gotta weed them out
general 2022-12-18 03:22:34 eh most people are 13+
general 2022-12-18 03:22:41 i dont know barely any underaged devs that are good
general 2022-12-18 03:22:47 just going through portfolio submissions
general 2022-12-18 03:23:29 have they done any pc2 tests?
general 2022-12-18 03:23:33 or hired testers
general 2022-12-18 03:23:43 LOL
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:57:37 the map is most definitely NOT going to be infinite
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:57:56 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:57:57 maybe alot bigger
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:58:10 it would just kill more peoples pcs
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:58:16 and judging by how pc1 already does that when loading some builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:58:56 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:59:04 pc1 is already optimized pretty decently imo
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 05:59:34 if its better in pc2 then thats a huge bonus especially for giga builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 06:00:00 a plot size increase would definitely lead to some insane 1 plot builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 06:03:08 theres others games out there besides plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 06:03:12 dont burn yourself out
general 2022-12-18 06:04:14 i think u need an expert rank
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 06:04:31 i said not infinite
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 06:04:35 not not bigger
general 2022-12-18 06:07:09 im og

general 2022-12-23 04:25:32 tank fish tutorials were actually valid tho
general 2022-12-23 04:25:36 his build skills were crazy back then

general 2022-12-23 04:27:22 props to whoever made the edit
general 2022-12-23 04:27:25 what is armadaa
general 2022-12-23 04:27:55 oh its an actual military group
general 2022-12-23 04:28:54 i have shaders
general 2022-12-23 04:29:08 
general 2022-12-23 04:29:31 roshade has like all of it doesnt really matter
general 2022-12-23 04:29:36 it just depends how u customize it
general 2022-12-23 04:30:19 its unfortunate how plane crazies helicopters now arent fucking helicopters
general 2022-12-23 04:30:25 they are planes with spinning wing panels
general 2022-12-23 04:30:37 yes
general 2022-12-23 04:30:52 the rotors do nothing
general 2022-12-23 04:30:54 is what im saying
general 2022-12-23 04:31:00 its just spinning wing panels
general 2022-12-23 04:31:39 its not really that
general 2022-12-23 04:31:41 its just sizing
general 2022-12-23 04:31:44 but nobody wants to upsize things
general 2022-12-23 04:31:49 yes
general 2022-12-23 04:31:51 everyone wants a compact
general 2022-12-23 04:31:52 heli
general 2022-12-23 04:31:52 motorlocked
general 2022-12-23 04:31:59 that has a million things in it
general 2022-12-23 04:32:07 if u upsize it a bit u can fit huge things in there
general 2022-12-23 04:32:18 idk who was doing it but i think it was G4M3 that was experimenting with helis back then
general 2022-12-23 04:32:31 and he would make these crazy helicopter swashplates
general 2022-12-23 04:33:09 i think it was sakura actually
general 2022-12-23 04:33:10 not g4m3
general 2022-12-23 04:33:16 tht rings a bell
general 2022-12-23 04:33:22 g4m3 is the big plane guy
general 2022-12-23 04:33:47 that is a good exmaple of a good sized build
general 2022-12-23 04:33:54 but do the rotors do anything? 🤔
general 2022-12-23 04:34:06 or is it internally flown....
general 2022-12-23 04:34:18 very nice men
general 2022-12-23 04:34:25 either way itd still be fine if the rotors did nothing
general 2022-12-23 04:34:27 thats a crazy build
general 2022-12-23 04:34:39 also a crazy build
general 2022-12-23 04:34:55 oh yeah motor lock just adds so much weight
general 2022-12-23 04:36:57 15 in texas is crazy
general 2022-12-23 04:37:08 its 44 for me rn

general 2022-12-23 05:14:11 with the no borders
general 2022-12-23 05:14:12 on blocks
general 2022-12-23 05:14:15 it doesnt really matter
general 2022-12-23 05:14:18 its not that noticeable
general 2022-12-23 05:14:19 yes
general 2022-12-23 05:14:51 everyone can make a bismarck
general 2022-12-23 05:14:53 detail and sizing
general 2022-12-23 05:14:56 are the problem
general 2022-12-23 05:15:06 i cba to learn all that new stuff just to make a different hull
general 2022-12-23 05:15:12 especially after i just made this one
general 2022-12-23 05:15:32 vipempire make poop ship
general 2022-12-23 05:15:54 my wedge design good

general 2022-12-24 02:22:00 not really
general 2022-12-24 02:22:03 you email roblox, get a bot reply
general 2022-12-24 02:22:08 and then half the time they dont do shit
general 2022-12-24 02:22:14 or some other BS
general 2022-12-24 02:22:24 roblox support is one of the worst supports in existence
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 02:26:04 rip
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:25:36 building suspension is not the same at all of a suspension block
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:25:39 its a difficult and tedious thing to do
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:26:02 if u cant build suspension just say that
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:26:12 its like building a huge ship vs a tiny ship
general 2022-12-24 05:43:46 blahhh
general 2022-12-24 05:43:47 almost done
general 2022-12-24 05:44:27 cant tell if thats satire but 1 day build so far
general 2022-12-24 05:45:02 is it actually?
general 2022-12-24 05:45:13 its 5200 blocks atm i think
general 2022-12-24 05:45:31 wym
general 2022-12-24 05:45:53 
general 2022-12-24 05:46:01 i mean its not really
general 2022-12-24 05:46:02 a blocky hull
general 2022-12-24 05:46:06 its smooth ish for wedges
general 2022-12-24 05:46:17 no thats stupid
general 2022-12-24 05:46:22 and it would look wrose
general 2022-12-24 05:46:23 worse
general 2022-12-24 05:46:37 smooth hulls
general 2022-12-24 05:46:39 for modern ships
general 2022-12-24 05:46:41 wedge hulls for old ships
general 2022-12-24 05:46:47 you cant get the angles
general 2022-12-24 05:46:49 like that w/ motorlock
general 2022-12-24 05:47:20 ^
general 2022-12-24 05:47:42 and atp using a super complex smooth hull to replicate the actual ship what point do you realize ur stupid
general 2022-12-24 05:48:11 
general 2022-12-24 05:48:14 
general 2022-12-24 05:48:17 and it doesnt even look bad
general 2022-12-24 05:48:22 its not like the old blocks
general 2022-12-24 05:48:59 with the no borders on blocks anymore wedge hulls 📈
general 2022-12-24 05:49:13 it all blends together nicely in the end
general 2022-12-24 05:49:52 if it was a modern ship id use a smooth hull
general 2022-12-24 05:49:58 but thats it
general 2022-12-24 05:50:21 zumwalt is fire
general 2022-12-24 05:52:07 man used the worst ship to make an example on
general 2022-12-24 05:52:23 show an example on a ww2 ship
general 2022-12-24 05:52:26 with realistic scaling
general 2022-12-24 05:52:34 theres no room for all that shite
general 2022-12-24 05:53:03 maybe if rick made the plots bigger
general 2022-12-24 05:55:01 this should be a very good 1:5 reprenstation of what im making
general 2022-12-24 05:55:11 some of these parts are aids though
general 2022-12-24 05:55:20 mainly turrets
general 2022-12-24 05:55:59 1 rocket: whole ship explodes
general 2022-12-24 05:56:40 theres no functionality in a 6k block ship
general 2022-12-24 05:57:12 pvp wise your just a 6k clunky ship with the same weapon count as a 100 block plane
general 2022-12-24 05:57:20 thats the opposite of copium
general 2022-12-24 05:58:04 unless its a carrier thats super huge theres no functionality in a ship its just a showcase
general 2022-12-24 05:58:33 is pc2 going to be a new game or just transferring the game files to the current game

general 2023-02-12 17:55:30 but flightpoint uses that type of building
general 2023-02-12 17:55:34 when pc is block based
general 2023-02-12 17:55:43 so obviously you can make more detailed builds
general 2023-02-12 17:55:52 but plane crazys manueverability and flying abilities are far far evolved

general 2023-02-18 23:58:52 worst?
general 2023-02-18 23:59:09 that makes them the best
general 2023-02-19 01:51:57 didnt take long for people to build not planes on that game
general 2023-02-19 02:17:24 pretty much every plane game ever 2
general 2023-02-19 17:39:09 robot lobby
general 2023-02-19 17:51:01 show me the thug shaker
general 2023-02-19 17:51:03 cmon bro
general 2023-02-20 02:16:55 yes if u spam rockets and guns on a plane you can handle ground units 🤯
general 2023-02-21 03:54:42 the plan
general 2023-02-21 03:54:55 did discord change their images wtf
general 2023-02-21 03:55:09 images are way bigger than they used to be
general 2023-02-21 05:07:44 what is it
general 2023-02-21 05:07:46 and how is that 20k
general 2023-02-21 05:07:53 did you build it out of 1x1s?
general 2023-02-21 05:08:13 so its a 5k build
general 2023-02-21 05:08:17 but you decided to make it annoying
general 2023-02-21 05:09:21 how many blocks is it?
general 2023-02-21 05:10:10 how many blocks is it?
general 2023-02-21 05:10:14 xfinity
general 2023-02-21 05:10:41 i think the pcc server needs to know how many blocks it is for the 66th time
general 2023-02-21 05:11:09 functionality isnt building the entire boat out of 1x1s
general 2023-02-21 05:11:15 its a 5k boat
general 2023-02-21 05:11:18 thats made to lag people
general 2023-02-21 05:11:21 on purpose
general 2023-02-21 05:11:43 using 1x1s makes it look even worse infact unless your doing different shading for that extra minute detail
general 2023-02-21 05:11:51 same
general 2023-02-21 05:12:10 a 20k boat isnt useful is pvp
general 2023-02-21 05:12:14 that arguement is invalid
general 2023-02-21 05:12:55 just admit is a 5-8k boat that u crammed full of shit and made out of 1x1s to make it 20k blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:14:46 ^
general 2023-02-21 05:15:17 its a 6k boat with no functionality besides being a sitting target after its done crashing the whole server
general 2023-02-21 05:15:33 you probably used paint blocks and painted them all the way around to think its cooler
general 2023-02-21 05:16:04 im not coping for anything im calling your boat stupid and impractical and a showcase piece that could be made in 15k less blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:16:59 theres no extra practicality in the long term with it being 15k more blocks ?
general 2023-02-21 05:17:11 not even the slightest
general 2023-02-21 05:17:25 i didnt say it cant be 20k
general 2023-02-21 05:17:28 im sayingit can be built in 5k
general 2023-02-21 05:17:30 dingus
general 2023-02-21 05:17:42 and thats my point
general 2023-02-21 05:17:47 we arent
general 2023-02-21 05:17:58 im just saying u spent 15k more blocks worth of time to build a boat thats pointless
general 2023-02-21 05:18:09 and your only copium is to continuously talk about it 30 times each day in here
general 2023-02-21 05:18:27 nobody cares
general 2023-02-21 05:18:56 im saying i dont care about you talking about ur boat 50 times
general 2023-02-21 05:19:08 
general 2023-02-21 05:19:17 hurr durr its 20k blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:19:31 youve been talking about it since may of last year
general 2023-02-21 05:19:47 the most pointless thing is you getting included in the argument because you want attention
general 2023-02-21 05:20:20 i never had an argument either you are just fabricating one out of thin air
general 2023-02-21 05:20:27 all i said is that ur build can be built in 15k less blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:20:35 and that its functionality in the future plays no part
general 2023-02-21 05:20:42 and you're getting all worked up
general 2023-02-21 05:21:00 yes when pc2 releases in 2 more years
general 2023-02-21 05:21:05 you can have 20 more frames
general 2023-02-21 05:21:31 im really not
general 2023-02-21 05:21:44 i was never mad at all you im literally just sitting here staring at my screen with a blank face
general 2023-02-21 05:22:45 i dont see why you're thinking of a false reality where im confused or mad about a block count being 20k, i literally said it can be built in 5-8k blocks then this dude gets all mad saying no it cant and talking about functionality in the future
general 2023-02-21 05:22:53 if you would read above
general 2023-02-21 05:22:55 you would see that
general 2023-02-21 05:22:57 very obviously
general 2023-02-21 05:23:15 sir bubbington go ahead and read above where i was talking about it
general 2023-02-21 05:23:53 what if it corrupts in pc2
general 2023-02-21 05:23:55 then it goes to the shitter
general 2023-02-21 05:24:00 and u have to rebuild it in 15k less blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:24:01 LOL
general 2023-02-21 05:24:28 bro youve talked about it 50 times and your talking about unwanted opinions like wha
general 2023-02-21 05:24:50 you talk about ur build continuously and you only want positive opinions
general 2023-02-21 05:24:56 thats like someone getting mad their build got downvoted in creations
general 2023-02-21 05:25:11 im talking about since he made it
general 2023-02-21 05:25:33 7/12/22 when he first brought it up
general 2023-02-21 05:25:40 since then its like every day or other day he brings it up
general 2023-02-21 05:25:59 when did i say anything about it being in a timeline
general 2023-02-21 05:26:07 im saying hes talked about it that much
general 2023-02-21 05:26:23 i mean yea its truly unfortunate everytime i open this chat i happen to see you talking about your 20k boat
general 2023-02-21 05:26:35 a shame indeed
general 2023-02-21 05:27:03 did anyone ask for you to share your 20k boat?
general 2023-02-21 05:27:14 did anyone ask for you to talk about your build?
general 2023-02-21 05:27:40 oh thanks you are confirming im the only person who gives a shit about your 20k boat
general 2023-02-21 05:27:42 i guess nobody else does
general 2023-02-21 05:27:43 LOL
general 2023-02-21 05:27:46 and yet you still talk about it
general 2023-02-21 05:27:49 what a tard
general 2023-02-21 05:27:59 i cant open the chat without seeing ur shitty build
general 2023-02-21 05:28:13 and from what youve confirmed nobody cares to see it either
general 2023-02-21 05:29:14 your scrolling up to screenshot messages you cared that much
general 2023-02-21 05:29:32 i said what is it ( what is the build ) and (how is it 20k?)
general 2023-02-21 05:29:36 then i saw the build
general 2023-02-21 05:29:38 which is why i asked
general 2023-02-21 05:29:42 and then i said it can be build in less blocks
general 2023-02-21 05:30:16 2 very obvious questions and then when i realized i explained how it can be built less and he clearly didnt like that arguing about its functionality in the future
general 2023-02-21 05:30:41 what if pc2 doesnt have increased plot length
general 2023-02-21 05:30:59 what if ur account gets banned with the 20k boat
