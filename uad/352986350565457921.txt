creations-chat 2020-10-19 19:16:04 <@456226577798135808> a good frame but its just one block too high. Also for windows, you might have to make it a little bit big, but all in all its lookin' good.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 19:36:41 <@456226577798135808> that 1x1 wedge by the top. Add another one, shifting the build up by one.

The easier way to do this is to remove the 1x2, and 1x4 wedge at the top.

Add a second 1x1 wedge so it should look like a 1x1, 1x1, 1x2, and 1x4 wedge at the top. The two 1x1 wedges should be a window due to the size of the 747. if its just one block high window then the window would look small.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 19:39:36 <@456226577798135808> what I just said is kinda a guess on how it would look like since I made a full scale 787 and the windows fit the whole jist of the plane

If you want to then you can do motor locking but it can reduce the amount of block height you will use.

general 2022-04-02 16:02:32 ey dont complain about the game, complain about the roblox platform
general 2022-04-02 16:03:49 at this point, roblox should just shut the servers completely for once and conduct a mass reboot and get ourselves out and go outside for once
general 2022-04-02 16:04:46 other games are experiencing as well but differently
