general 2020-10-25 03:15:41 Is anybody else’s rockets glitched in pvp
general 2020-10-25 03:16:15 Like where it’ll just disappear once you fire it
bug-reports 2020-10-26 12:23:33 I’m not sure if anyone else have complained about this problem but in pvp when I fire rockets they only fire When I’m staying still if I’m moving they just disappear when I fire them.
bug-reports 2020-10-26 12:24:18 I’ve had it for a couple days that’s why it’s strange
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 02:24:48 I haven’t been able to fire my rockets while moving for like 3 weeks now

bug-reports 2021-03-01 00:47:53 It’s been like 3 months since I haven’t been able to fire rockets while moving, I have to stop my build in order for them to work
bug-reports 2021-03-01 01:08:55 Nah I tried it on slow vehicles too, it doesn’t matter if it’s a car or a plane or a boat either
bug-reports 2021-03-01 01:09:03 I’ve also tried re installing roblox

general 2021-04-17 06:05:49 I barely know java tho
general 2021-04-17 06:06:08 Anyways I was using a system called hydra which is basically a brute force password guesser
general 2021-04-17 06:06:18 And that apparently saves none of your work
help 2021-05-18 00:18:21 I haven’t been able to fire rockets for 5 months 😐
general 2021-05-19 01:11:03 I haven’t been able to fire rockets for like 5 months now 💀 I can only shoot them if my build is completely still
general 2021-05-19 01:14:03 There’s  no videos on it and when I go to help people don’t know either
general 2021-05-19 01:14:09 So cursed
general 2021-05-19 01:14:38 My pc runs the game pretty well
general 2021-05-19 01:15:13 When I shoot the rocket while moving it’ll disappear but won’t fire but then it’ll reload
general 2021-05-19 01:15:20 And doesn’t explode or damage anything
general 2021-05-19 01:16:10 It worked fine before tho with the same pc and same WiFi
general 2021-05-19 01:17:38 I’d ask a dev but I feel like they’d be “go to <#478584971670454284>”

general 2021-05-19 01:33:03 Fr tho check out Brief Karate Foolish it has a lot of potential and is free on steam

general 2021-09-04 06:12:07 Philosophicaly speaking banana cannot objectively exist in my opinion, as in our existence in it of its self is subjective, objectivity of our reality would need proof of a higher power, which cannot be proven with materialism which modern day scholars often attempt. Materialism can only prove what is currently around us physically but does not give the answer to the existence of god, as god is assumed as other worldly and metaphysical. In truth there is no way to prove banana 🍌
general 2021-09-04 06:14:03 😏bet
general 2021-09-04 06:15:29 Philosophicaly speaking, TikTok can cure cancer. Physicist now believe in a theory known as the multi verse, where anything could be possible in these infinite realms, so with the assumption of these facts TikTok can subjectively cure cancer.
general 2021-09-04 06:15:35 <@!877391100137070625>
general 2021-09-04 06:16:07 That is a objective assumption 😏😏
general 2021-09-04 06:16:30 Philosophicaly speaking ur wrong nerd
general 2021-09-04 06:17:15 Just because TikTok can develop cancer doesn’t mean it can’t cure it 😈
general 2021-09-04 06:18:06 How so? Fully fully
general 2021-09-04 06:18:13 Dilly dilly *
general 2021-09-04 06:19:12 AHA! You’ve contradicted yourself good sir! You just made a subjective statement proving the existance of subjectivity meaning my theory of TikTok curing cancer does indeed happen!
general 2021-09-04 06:19:24 Dilly dilly!
general 2021-09-04 06:19:50 Yes 😩😩
general 2021-09-04 06:20:06 Reasonable
general 2021-09-04 06:20:56 Exactly why TikTok can cure cancer
general 2021-09-04 06:21:14 Subjective morality aka subjectivity 😏😏
general 2021-09-04 06:21:25 Yes 😩😩
general 2021-09-04 06:21:38 Human opinions don’t mean wrong opinions
general 2021-09-04 06:21:49 Dababy
general 2021-09-04 06:21:57 Which is a subjective statement
general 2021-09-04 06:23:48 Why killing 80 children isn’t wrong, the assumption that killing 80 children is wrong as a objective statement of morality, but if morality was objective then we as humans wouldn’t have differing opinions on various things including politics, so yes morality is subjective, meaning killing 80 children is only wrong to a individual not to the masses. <@!877391100137070625>
general 2021-09-04 06:24:16 Exactly what I’m saying
general 2021-09-04 06:24:37 How so?
general 2021-09-04 06:24:54 Yes I agree?
general 2021-09-04 06:25:25 Just because of subjectivity doesn’t mean it cannot be argued upon, I was making a statement in favor of subjectivity
general 2021-09-04 06:26:04 Diet cok I mean diet cok I mean diet cok
general 2021-09-04 06:26:59 I disagree completely, morality should be and can be argued upon. Subjective morality means it can change and people change it by arguing upon their different opinions do right and wrong. It is our job as a species to grow with this.
general 2021-09-04 06:27:46 Nobody has an objective job, I merely recommending to play a part
general 2021-09-04 06:29:20 Well we shouldn’t look at it as winning or losing, we should look at it as voicing our opinions
general 2021-09-04 06:29:46 Arguments/debates are discussions?
general 2021-09-04 06:30:01 No they aren’t.
general 2021-09-04 06:30:50 A debate is people civilly discussing their points and disagreements? How is a debate not a discussion?
general 2021-09-04 06:31:55 Yes, but they do so by discussing their opinions
general 2021-09-04 06:32:09 So it’s a discussion
general 2021-09-04 06:32:23 Chatting is a discussion
general 2021-09-04 06:32:56 Discussion is an umbrella term which includes debating it’s just multiple people talking to eachother regardless of the reasons why
general 2021-09-04 06:33:30 Why can’t discussions be specific?
general 2021-09-04 06:33:43 I disagree completely
general 2021-09-04 06:34:07 That’s like saying a piece of bread is made of atoms but not all pieces of atoms are bread, they’re still both the same
general 2021-09-04 06:34:26 It’s all still made up of atoms
general 2021-09-04 06:34:41 Just as a debate is still made up of discussions
general 2021-09-04 06:35:09 It is tho
general 2021-09-04 06:35:43 You cannot debate without discussion  there for without discussion there cannot be a debate
general 2021-09-04 06:35:59 No?
general 2021-09-04 06:36:06 But all debates are discussions
general 2021-09-04 06:37:02 I agree that not all discussions are debates I never claimed that, but all debates but be discussions as a debate cannot exist without the discussion
general 2021-09-04 06:37:33 Exactly
general 2021-09-04 06:37:47 No when did I claim that?
general 2021-09-04 06:37:57 I said that all debates are discussions
general 2021-09-04 06:38:19 Let me find it
general 2021-09-04 06:39:36 Yes that’s my opinion
general 2021-09-04 06:40:02 No not all discussions are debates
general 2021-09-04 06:40:22 Just because all pieces of bread are made of molecules doesn’t mean all molecules are made of bread
general 2021-09-04 06:40:26 It can’t go both ways
general 2021-09-04 06:40:57 You’re claiming that because debates are all made of discussions that all discussions must be made of debates which doesn’t make sense
general 2021-09-04 06:41:15 I think we’re both lost
general 2021-09-04 06:41:29 Weren’t we talking about morality
general 2021-09-04 06:41:51 No that’s not true at all
general 2021-09-04 06:42:23 Just because one thing goes one way doesn’t mean it goes the other, again all pieces of bread are made of atoms but not all atoms are bread atoms
general 2021-09-04 06:42:57 Well philosophy doesn’t objectively need to Aline to mathematics
general 2021-09-04 06:43:35 I consider debates to be discussions but not all discussions to be debates
general 2021-09-04 06:43:40 They are not equal
general 2021-09-04 06:43:44 Only one side is true
general 2021-09-04 06:44:12 I did say that tho
general 2021-09-04 06:44:22 Let me scroll
general 2021-09-04 06:45:19 
general 2021-09-04 06:45:42 It was misspelled which may of caused the confusion
general 2021-09-04 06:46:12 Well then we’ve come to the conclusion we’ve agreed the entire time
general 2021-09-04 06:46:33 Dilly dilly
general 2021-09-04 06:47:35 Toaster in bathtub?
general 2021-09-04 06:47:50 That that’s a subjective truth
general 2021-09-04 06:48:33 I have a fever, it’s 2 am and I’m talking about the relativity of discussions to debates
