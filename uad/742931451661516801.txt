general 2022-11-08 14:19:51 bruh I have to be level 3 to send imagesT^T
general 2022-11-08 14:20:36 oh hi obelisk
general 2022-11-08 14:21:11 no
general 2022-11-08 14:21:23 I will continue to randomly talk to post a mech
general 2022-11-08 14:21:27 because I want to
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 10:55:26 you could make it go forward much faster
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 10:55:36 if you use a flapping wing mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 10:55:46 instead of 1 motor 2 per wing and a piston
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 11:15:10 I could also show you the mechanism if you want
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 11:15:14 it's really simple
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:36:50 sticks and motors
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:36:58 unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:37:24 or motor 2 0 torque everything off and whatever angle you need
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:50:44 how did you not
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:52:50 no one that makes vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:53:10 some people that make small creatures using motor 2 0 torque often
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:53:41 its really useful as a joint, really useless for vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 01:42:17 only for smaller creatures bigger creatures just use unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 01:42:34 and blocks to limit the "bend"
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 02:41:19 goofy ahh walker
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 02:41:35 it has so many panels
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 02:41:40 too unstable for walking
creations-chat 2023-01-12 00:09:58 <@578603895736238100> what did it just disconnect from its feet at 0:8
creations-chat 2023-01-12 01:47:23 10 days is not enough to make a good plane tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-12 04:51:34 its so goofy ðŸ’€ there are only like 2 joints not including the limbs...
creations-chat 2023-01-23 02:28:06 <@535580493442187274> holy hell can it also function as both a car and robot?
creations-chat 2023-02-17 02:03:23 yea I noticed whenever there is a creature build it always gets upvotes
most of the time its just decent and would be criticised a lot in the servers I'm in
istg there is some bias or something
creations-chat 2023-02-20 03:47:47 <@765598011995848754> dear god thats the most realistic bird I have ever seen
