creations-chat 2018-11-26 13:01:01 A prototype moving fortress, capable of transversing across most offroad terrain at around 325 SPS, known as Giga Centauri.
Official Info
Build Name: Giga Centauri
My Username: Doomakarn
Block Count: 2119
creations-chat 2018-11-26 13:01:35 Also has 2k parts.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:03:34 h
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:05:19 Also is rules and info supposed to be empty?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:05:56 **Maybe that should be fixed.**
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:10:16 h
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:10:30 I need sum raenks
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:11:06 I did
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:11:20 I already got something in creations.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:11:42 Giga Centauri thing.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:11:44 Most recent.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:11:59 k
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:12:13 I'll wait I'm a patient boy.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:13:57 I wonder if it qualifies as a Modeller rank too, because I don't think anybody has made a moving fortress with houses.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:14:54 Being an actual builder has it's perks. 👌 😤
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:18:19 I'm talking in studio.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:18:23 As in Roblox Studio.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:18:26 That's what I mean.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:20:59 I can't script u wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:21:47 I see that talking about studio awakens the devs from their eternal slumber.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:22:51 Oh and I forgot to add official info for my build, but I'm not allowed to repost rip.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:23:39 I can see how
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:24:36 I'm stuck in a catch 22.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:25:40 Guess I just pray that my edited message gets read.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:26:52 Omg, I just remembered what I was originally going to suggest
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:27:16 Cylinders.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:27:43 What's wrong with cylinders though.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:28:16 That's because it's a good suggestion?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:28:37 Also how do I escape this catch 22 with my creation submission.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:30:45 I cri

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:35:49 Warning 2/3
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:36:13 Warning 5/3
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:36:31 Warning 16/1
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:37:21 My Giga Centauri literally has a missile launcher on it, but the missile just hits stuff instead of exploding.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:37:50 I accidentally squashed somebody with it once.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:39:05 The only real combat superior vehicles are planes.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:39:15 Which is a big sad.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:40:32 I'm attempting to make it so.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:40:40 In suggestions.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:40:59 So I can literally have an indestructible moving fortress.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:41:11 That shoots you.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:41:23 Ever heard of a word called exaggeration?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:42:01 Giga Centauri can not be flipped over though, it can only ever be split.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:42:33 Like some kind of Raiden scene.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:43:14 It took 15 mins for two planes to take it down, and in the end they didn't even hit me.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:43:36 **hmm**
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:43:52 Shameless plug for a secondary game.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:44:44 busy not being homeless
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:45:20 He'd rather earn money and not go homeless than help a few kids have more fun in a game on Roblox.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:45:28 👀
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:45:49 ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:46:03 He earns it from his part time job at that *weird place with the poles.*
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:46:32 jk pls no bad me
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:46:40 😩
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:46:44 👏
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:49:34 i cri
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:50:05 but does it qualify as NSFW though? hmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:50:11 I'll make a study for my case
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:52:55 I believe it is classified as an inneundo that will go over most children's heads, and not quite enough to qualify as NSFW, as to what it refers to is created within the mind, giving no direct indication of NSFW purposes especially to the younger audiences the content is meant to be prevented from reaching.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:53:02 Kind of like in cartoons.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:53:50 NSFW is meant to protect the people who ARE kids.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:54:11 If there were confirmed no children here, I doubt the rule would be implemented to a heavy degree.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:54:53 Despite this, there are still kids under 13.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:55:10 I personally know a few.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:55:39 One of them is legit 12 but claims he's 18.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:56:37 If discord is not designed for children of those ages that the rule is designed to protect them against, it is the child's fault more than it is mine. Therefore I am innocent.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:57:45 School isn't the only thing hard... work is; very difficult to a significant degree.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:58:42 Wait why is swearing allowed but suggestive NSFW jokes aren't.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:58:57 👀
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:59:45 I see.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 13:59:55 ***frick***
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:00:27 Considering my 12 year old friend says the N word, I'm pretty sure that indicator isn't going to work.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:00:54 I'm also not saying N because I'm white, so yeah still not under 13.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:01:03 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:01:13 👀
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:01:47 Wow I don't even think you guys got my 2nd inneundo.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:01:56 Or did you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:02:16 no ur getttin banned for threating me
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:02:20 o no
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:02:23 I just threatened u
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:02:37 We are sinners.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:03:40 You guys like to invoke your most powerful builds don't you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:04:20 I have the ability to counter your weapons no matter what.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:04:28 Dare you to try and I'll prove it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:05:23 Wow
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:05:26 Deleters are giey
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:05:52 This card is still in play even if you delete it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:05:59 It's part of the abilities, which you don't read.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:06:14 You guys are perma no-u'd.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:06:55 That's probably how he got his warns.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:07:40 They mean anime in general.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:07:46 I previously had one.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:07:55 But I opted out for this pristine PFP.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:08:30 Why does it have dark eyebrows but he's blond?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:09:05 Why is my PFP a fish from Sharktale on Shin Godzilla's body?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:09:09 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:10:26 I see that discord quotes are fine.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:10:55 Well I found this guy once.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:11:11 I actually have autism, so it's okay.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:11:15 But that's not me.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:11:27 😩 👍
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:12:55 According to the ranks I can make a big block of cubes with 1k parts and it would make me a master builder.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:13:03 and wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:13:31 But what if it's ordered block spam?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:13:49 😩 👌
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:14:46 What if I make it a big block of cubes, but it has support beams around it so it doesnt fall over, does it count now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:14:58 y not
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:15:40 What if I make it a cube and put like 1000 seats inside and call it Bus God.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:15:48 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:13 But it has meaningful design.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:25 Intentionally made for carrying 1000 people.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:48 When do we cross the border?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:20 Does a moving city count
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:47 What if I label the thing with 1000 seats as a city?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:18:30 What if I make a building inside that houses 1 seat, and then in the far other corner there's an elevated platform, but with a desk.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:18:32 Does it count now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:21:17 This entire conversation was hypothetical, I already have a build with 2k blocks and meaningful design.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:21:38 Giga Centauri in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:22:23 It has two cafes, 4 houses, a seating area for when it moves, multiples bridges for transversing through it and a captain's deck.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:22:53 And this is only a prototype btw.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:09 I almost forgot to mention the missile launcher.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:32 Yeah, but I'm still confused on what counts as reposting builds or not.

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:11:03 It's basically Roblox Lighting, but 10x better
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:12:04 It's not quite The Future Is Bright lighting though.

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:17:49 Does it usually take 24 hours of work time to make a lag overseer. 😩
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:42:11 Builder can apply to any type.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:42:48 To get this clear, when it says builder requirements, is it talking about quality or quantity?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:43:20 So I'll only get master for my 3k land build
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:43:29 Which isn't done.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:45:22 then go suggest it
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:07 He's talking about adjustable power output, like a car engine and their revs, I think.

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:16:28 Wait so you're removing his warnings.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:16:33 👀
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:17:33 Wow I wish I got warned by you instead, you're too forgiving.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:18:07 Also his warns don't appear, so nobody knows.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:18:43 Stop being very forgiving.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:19:02 Lay down justice when required.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:19:33 You're the weakspot in the mod team then.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:19:36 The hole in the barricade.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:20:17 You forgave him for NSFW.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:20:44 Forgiving for swearing is fine, but that's NSFW.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:27 Oh okay, guess the mod team is lacking nowadays then.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:46 No?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:50 Who's that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:22:28 I applaud activity, but you're not willing to lay down justice even on NSFW.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:00 When I got warned there was no mercy.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:07 A solid action.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:51 I prefer to spend my activity elsewhere.

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:41:17 But if another person was inside it would slowly float down.

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:41:55 Liar.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:42:29 I'm gonna go make a propeller that has propellers coming off of it.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:43:08 It's probably the same as a normal block.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:43:29 If you have ever used studio once in your life you know what "anchored" means.

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:11:59 😩
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:37:15 I dont think the server exterminator is any longer achievable, because it would go over 260 save data.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:37:31 My 2.7k part land thing is like 258 save data.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:37:47 <:omegalul:528987216643489792>
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:38:39 So like 258 data and 260 data are worlds apart?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:39:01 258 data = 2.7k parts
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:39:07 260 data = 10k parts
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:39:49 I've got out my 2.7k data creation and this is what it reads.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:40:12 No.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:40:33 I assumed that it was reading what is presently displayed, because it jumps up and down.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:40:50 It goes up and down depending on what creation is present.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:41:37 now I just pulled out my 300 part creation.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:41:44 Now it's magically lower.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:42:08 Then how do we tell what is legitimate data left?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:42:14 Oh wait

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:43:40 Oh true, I just understood what ur saying.

the-dump 2021-06-22 14:58:40 if you scroll up you can see someone saying 'chad' and posting a video of the kenyan president being interviewed and stating gay rights are of no importance
the-dump 2021-06-22 14:59:30 and then saying 'chad' again after posting a video about a ugandan anti-gay bill being passed that makes it so gay people are locked up, and people MUST report them.
the-dump 2021-06-22 15:00:27 crazy how people are still stupid enough to be homophobic
the-dump 2021-06-22 15:01:28 I'm all for people making fun of radicals, i.e. radical feminists, crazy LGBT supporters
the-dump 2021-06-22 15:01:39 but legit it's kinda crazy

the-dump 2022-03-12 20:26:48 That's the best meme I've seen in days.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:32:38 Why the fuck did you just post someone potential having just died on camera? Can someone get some fucking mods in here?
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:36:37 <@!370594904268734464> Theawesomegamer7900 just posted a kid that probably just died on camera.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:44:30 Not a single staff member is online 🗿 (aside from rickje)
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:46:22 I'm guessing they're not gonna do anything about the fact that a kid probably just died on camera.

the-dump 2022-03-16 23:48:21 Unironically one of the most disturbing things I've seen on the internet.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:49:35 I've seen people die, countless corpses, heads split open. But to see a child literally just fucking dying from a huge dozen metre drop is far worse than being shot/stabbed. It's so brutal.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:50:20 What's worse is that person, and whoever made the video think it's funny.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:50:41 Literal psychopaths. Like, not just 'grr insensitive' like actual psychopathy. No emotions.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:57:30 <@!603974932585644043> Please do something.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:58:24 Thank you, at last.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:59:16 Kinda shocked that's not an instant ban given how psychopathic that user is.
the-dump 2022-03-16 23:59:20 I'm blocking them.
the-dump 2022-03-17 00:00:48 Has this guy been banned before 🗿
