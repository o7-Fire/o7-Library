general 2022-12-16 12:45:22 war thunder
general 2022-12-16 12:45:35 war thunder doesnt have modules
general 2022-12-16 12:46:46 where do you see modules in war thunder
general 2022-12-16 12:47:58 yea
general 2022-12-16 12:48:07 modifications?
general 2022-12-16 12:48:13 yea those exist
general 2022-12-16 12:49:00 thats not war thunder
general 2022-12-16 12:49:20 what
general 2022-12-16 12:49:26 ok
general 2022-12-16 12:50:16 cursed tank simulator is also alot laggier than war thunder
general 2022-12-16 12:50:54 ??
general 2022-12-16 12:51:06 and bombs
general 2022-12-16 12:51:09 but those are
general 2022-12-16 12:51:10 secondary weapons
general 2022-12-16 12:51:15 you cant change main
general 2022-12-16 12:51:25 you can only change
general 2022-12-16 12:51:26 the belts
general 2022-12-16 12:51:27 for main really
general 2022-12-16 12:51:37 for the japanese you can convert some guns to cannons though
general 2022-12-16 12:51:46 with modifications
general 2022-12-16 12:52:21 you can convert mg to cannons in japanese planes with modifications
general 2022-12-16 12:52:28 props
general 2022-12-16 12:52:43 yea
general 2022-12-16 12:53:13 then its just war thunder ground battles but worse
general 2022-12-16 12:53:20 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-16 12:53:26 oh
general 2022-12-16 12:53:46 roblox physics engine kinda sucks though so its not the best engine for planes n stuff
general 2022-12-16 12:53:57 unless you make your own physics
general 2022-12-16 12:54:41 so true
general 2022-12-16 12:54:57 im gonna make the bestest tank game ever
general 2022-12-16 12:56:00 oh god
general 2022-12-16 12:57:32 war thunder has alot of problems with balancing normal WWII planes
general 2022-12-16 12:57:45 and with an improved engine
general 2022-12-16 12:58:16 actually nvm you are right, the problems are mostly with jets
general 2022-12-16 12:58:22 6.0 is the worst BR to be
general 2022-12-16 12:58:35 with props
general 2022-12-16 12:59:05 plane crazy is good if you want to have fun but like
general 2022-12-16 12:59:17 you cant actually have cool dogfights or anything in plane crazy
general 2022-12-16 12:59:38 because people will just put small propeller engines on the nose and get 0.4s turn time or something
general 2022-12-16 13:02:18 xp 50
general 2022-12-16 13:02:44 wyverns are free kills
general 2022-12-16 13:03:14 f16 in 11.7 ðŸ’€
general 2022-12-16 13:03:33 it's easy to do it with p51d20
general 2022-12-16 13:03:47 until they crash into the ground
general 2022-12-16 13:03:56 because they don't want me to get a kill
general 2022-12-16 13:04:16 I can just build some altitude, I see a wyvern going for a base
general 2022-12-16 13:04:21 I go for the base too
general 2022-12-16 13:04:24 by diving
general 2022-12-16 13:04:30 they never do
general 2022-12-16 13:04:44 they are gonna dive bomb later anyways
general 2022-12-16 13:04:56 and I don't think wyverns have good energy retention
general 2022-12-16 13:05:17 then you fight off the other planes and ground pound
general 2022-12-16 13:05:29 or just return to airfield and leave
general 2022-12-16 13:05:34 if it's really not worth your time
general 2022-12-16 13:06:38 I once got in an air battles match where the enemy team was full of bombers and attackers and was actually organized
general 2022-12-16 13:06:46 they shredded off our tickets extremely quickly
general 2022-12-16 13:06:54 and we lost
general 2022-12-16 13:06:57 in a few minutes
general 2022-12-16 13:07:33 XP 50 isn't really that op from my experience
general 2022-12-16 13:07:37 it's extremely fragile
general 2022-12-16 13:07:48 and has low ammo
general 2022-12-16 13:07:57 su 11 to 7.7
general 2022-12-16 13:08:17 idk I'm probably using it wrong
general 2022-12-16 13:08:56 but with XP 50 you usually engage multiple enemies
general 2022-12-16 13:08:59 which is trouble
general 2022-12-16 13:09:18 unless you want to engage bombers and die to tail gunners
general 2022-12-16 13:09:34 none
general 2022-12-16 13:10:48 gaijin should really revamp alot of brs
general 2022-12-16 13:11:09 but idk why they wont
general 2022-12-16 13:11:36 the queue times are because people forget to add EU, RU or SA servers
general 2022-12-16 13:12:05 yea
general 2022-12-16 13:12:50 the worst game mode by far is sim
general 2022-12-16 13:13:29 its simply too slow paced and you need an entire setup for it
general 2022-12-16 13:13:33 it's really just for enthusiasts
general 2022-12-16 13:13:47 yea but it's horrible
general 2022-12-16 13:14:15 if you think realistic is slow paced wait till you see sim
general 2022-12-16 13:14:38 you do
general 2022-12-16 13:14:55 it's fun until you see the 100k repair cost
general 2022-12-16 13:15:30 gaijin punishes you for playing the game
general 2022-12-16 13:15:58 is it that bad
general 2022-12-16 13:16:31 but fast
general 2022-12-16 13:16:34 and big bonb
general 2022-12-16 13:16:42 it kinda is
general 2022-12-16 13:16:49 it can get like 500 or smth
general 2022-12-16 13:16:57 yes
general 2022-12-16 13:17:08 but only at 1.0
general 2022-12-16 13:17:34 the higher the br the worse it gets
general 2022-12-16 13:19:10 I wish there was a game like wt but less grind and more enjoyment
general 2022-12-16 13:20:02 yea but gmod isn't that complete
general 2022-12-16 13:20:24 the plane addons can vary
general 2022-12-16 13:20:28 from good to bad
general 2022-12-16 13:20:44 gaijin developers care about war thunder, the publishers only care about money though
general 2022-12-16 13:21:03 ok
general 2022-12-16 13:21:14 but I don't have friends
general 2022-12-16 13:21:24 laggy af
general 2022-12-16 13:21:40 cool
general 2022-12-16 22:34:16 what structure shoudl i build

general 2022-12-17 19:00:24 can you believe it guys? christmas is just a week away!
general 2022-12-17 19:00:53 so true i agre
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:08:29 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:09:28 thats cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:09:50 1 stud is actually exactly 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:09:59 which makes it very convenient for calculating m/s to km/h
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:11:14 since 1 stud = 1 km/h
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:17:18 read my explanation
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:17:38 not my problem
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:18:38 1 stud = 0.28 meter
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:19:28 world panel settings say otherwise
