help 2022-10-24 14:15:30 also, its because you have a motor on top of the other, its a bug, im pretty sure if you just put a block in between them it wont do that
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 14:23:09 i used too, tho im bored and dont know what to make so if anyone had suggestions that would be nice, also i dont make cars so no cars if you do

help 2022-10-26 18:48:07 is there any way i can make this terrain look any more realistic?
general 2022-10-29 00:12:06 bruh why did i let my hopes up with the events ping
general 2022-10-29 00:12:12 i thought pc2 came out
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:30:41 not really, as long as you get good hits you can take them out
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:32:59 you only ever see a shredder go above 1000 if its a higher end shredder
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:36:10 who wouldnt bruh
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:38:15 does CSA only do shredders?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:40:23 i mean like- just because they are named that doesn't mean they don't do other things
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:43:20 i mean yeah, im all for rebelling against shredders, i mean if you actualy plan on doing it im all for it
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:47:22 i mean we could design anti shredder planes that just work as a temporary counter until we figure out how to have a permeant counter
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:49:37 thats what i was planing atleast, then when we have the perma counter make that a tut for people so we can abolish the shredder community
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:51:39 i mean, with the group chat thing we can just set the vid to private send the vid in there and just have some security so nobody gives intel to the CSA about the weopons weakness
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:53:44 you want a group chat or server? server allows over 10+ people group chat 10 people max, ill just call it ASC for now (anti shredder comunity)
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:06:26 i mean we could do that but how are we going to attack then
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:13:34 added him
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:01:26 dude, do what you want i can try to help you due to the fact i make 1 wide jets all the time
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:03:29 yeah i have to dissagree too i main 1 wide jets, i have a ton of em
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:05:37 i havent made an f4 before so this would be my first but i have an idea for one
creations-chat 2022-12-13 08:30:55 i never asked, actually i take that back i am gonna try and fix it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 08:38:10 this better for a nose?
creations-chat 2022-12-13 18:23:24 damn this shit doin numbers, and im fixing it rn
creations-chat 2022-12-13 18:41:21 no its alot longer than it should be
creations-chat 2022-12-13 18:46:08 i was debating on making it longer lol, the nose currently:
i made it shorter
creations-chat 2022-12-13 18:56:36 i said in the post
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:16:06 look up x-59 X-plane
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:20:47 prob due to the fact first post's get mainly positive scores
i posted my x-59 without saying "first post" even tho it was and i got a ton of downvotes at first
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:22:49 damn, allready 6 upvotes and i just upploaded it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:25:11 unironicly i might make it like one of thoes long nose meme planes lol
like this
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:27:47 this shit doin much better numbers than the last post
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:33:58 the exhaust pipe?
just use sparklers
just set the spark limiter thing to shorter, and set the keybind to somthing you want
that way it will have the fire
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:38:07 oh wait its not christmas update yet you will have to wait

speaking of




ITS DECEMBER 13, 
WHEN IS THE CHRISTMAS UPDATE
ITS MY FAV UPDATE
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:42:11 rip
im hopeing rick sees this and actually does the christmas update
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:44:32 matybe but i doubt it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:47:01 yes it does
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:50:35 same
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:52:41 ahhh okay
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:58:14 the last development post for pc2 was 3 months ago :p

at this point is pc2 even coming out
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:01:22 from this vid it seems like its being made but maybe the devs had burnout and just stopped making it
because theres a taxiway in the backround
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:03:48 because the fact that that post was after:
and this was 3 months ago
previews still look sick tho, like a valcano instead of a pond and a bigger lab
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:05:53 and the last shout in the group on roblox was like 2 almost 3 years ago so
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:08:40 i said almost, 3 not is 3
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:10:47 also what sk60 should i make
general 2022-12-13 20:43:59 for 1, thats on accident, for 2 dont ping me just to say that
general 2022-12-13 20:44:16 lol
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:46:34 looks pretty good it just looks a little small
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:48:39 aight then otherwise it looks pretty good just try to hide some of the back motorlock a bit more then
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:56:46 yeah i have to agree your being really cringe
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:02:01 i think its a road or like, part of the lab
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:13:08 im keeping that private so people dont try and pull a predator on me
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:15:13 how the fuck would i get in if im under 13 dumbass, your roblox account has to be 13+ to verify
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:17:24 i forgot about that, comp ima tell you somthin in dms and comfirmation for that just to fuckin verify that im 13+ and im sending to you due to the fact i can actualy trust you
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:21:10 it looks fine just try to make it smoother planet
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 08:09:24 read announcments
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 08:12:47 i mean tbh it looks pretty good without i dont think you need em
creations-chat 2023-01-04 00:23:08 this is just my opinion but the cockpit looks a little short but again i say, just my opinion
bot-central 2023-01-04 00:26:29 !rank
creations-chat 2023-01-04 00:33:51 ahh okay
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:28:14 how would i make an after burner for this?
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:39:44 i want actual responses not joke ones
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:41:45 i tried that it didnt work, im trying smoke pipes now
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:45:35 i ment actual help
and you aint helping
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:49:17 i have all items, and im trying trails again
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:53:22 aight i got it to work thanks
also keep the right engine, it looks nice and has more detail
creations-chat 2023-01-04 05:26:34 yeah i did so what
creations-chat 2023-01-04 05:55:13 i did tho lol
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:29:08 yes but it looks like little to no effort was put into it, i could probs make it in 1-2 mins
<@776497943439474689> and i feel like he could build better than that so i really dont think that he put much effort into the wings, i feel like if he put a little more time into it it would look nicer compared to what it is now it just looks like no effort what so ever was put into even for a starter status
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:04:06 im gonna be honnest i cant tell if its a 3d model plane crazy or another game it looks really detailed for plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:07:01 im gonna be honnest i dont even think it could be plane crazy you cant get that result with plane crazy it looks way too smooth
and also you dont have the inventor rank i checked
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:09:46 yeah that kinda prooves it aint plane crazy lol
he wouldnt personally do that and no glitch would let you get planes that smooth, no blocks are that smooth, it would have to be really really big to do so
and even if you or i tried your build would have to be almost 12 times bigger than the current plot size
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:11:53 lol also that still wouldnt work even if anyone tried, also nice model, |
AND ima say this because im bored and have nothing to do i dont even think you could fold it, like i said 12 times bigger than the plot, witch would mean you could fold it one time and not even half of it would be done
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:16:14 also in my opinion you should add diffrent lvls of weathering and add some more on the side walks, it would probs look nicer
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:22:30 that looks much better ngl
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:25:29 quick question what era is the road, well, what year
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:27:40 hmm, it doesnt look like that tbh the roads looked a lil rogher try adding like a small pot hole and see if it looks any better, it doesnt really look like a soviet road that might be why, they didnt have very nice roads then so if you want you should try that
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:29:44 then before you fully make the buildings layout where you want the buildings, dont build them until your happy with the road, that way you dont gotta worry about the road later
thats just from my experience if you dont wanna do that you dont have too
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:45:06 thats pretty decent
bot-central 2023-01-13 21:47:58 !rank
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:49:09 just because somebody made an f14 doesnt mean you always get to hate on a decent plane :p f14s are cool, exspecialy if you have actually seen one irl
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:54:33 also if you are adding more things to that store add a little freezer wall it would add a little more and it would make sense
and also i never asked <@718416920474288149>
creations-chat 2023-01-13 21:56:51 lemme get you a picture try and make it like a 7/11 interior it would make sense, look nice, and kinda add some immersion
basicly just make a russian nockoff of 7/11
creations-chat 2023-01-14 00:26:41 much better, sorry i was afk
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:14:12 should i make an f18 or f14 with an advanced targetting pod?
idk im just bored and want somthing to do
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:17:13 ima be honnest i just wanted to know if i should make an advanced targetting pod it was and is probs just gonna be a f14 because thats a base and its a 2 seater and yes ik the f18 has a double variant idc
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:35:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhLGnF0uM-E just a quick targetting pod demo free to use i guess, ima make it more advanced and compact soon tho
any feedback would be nice i guess
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:48:24 it aint my fault that i was bored and really didnt wanna put any effort into this also its for the quick showcase i dont really care about my pfp
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:51:28 yea and your not even talking about the build your just being rude and talking about the account that i made a few years ago
nobody cares
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:53:53 "wow webbed pfp, nice" sounds like rude sarcasm to me
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:58:45 i mean thats cool and all sorry for miss understanding but try and say somthin that doesnt sound like bad sarcasm
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:02:24 just a quick update on the advanced targeting pod, covered up most of the exposed elevation motor
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:04:34 and its a little more compact than the original but the exact same size, and it looks a little nicer
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:08:22 and now the plane for the pod....
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:30:37 it sadly allready is
tho tbh i think its bc of how simple it looks
the PCC likes builds that dont look simple
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:32:45 my only question is why is mine being downvoted to hell
you atleast got likes
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:36:15 also if your talking to me the only exsposed lock is >:D
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:39:01 all you have is cam lock so
theres no visible motor lock what so ver
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:41:53 also how tf is yours doin better than mine, mine looks alot more comlacated and less simple and yet i might have been wrong, maybe some people do like simplicity, or
its just they are doin it out of spite
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:44:04 tbh thats probs true
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:51:39 i feel like this says otherwise
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:54:15 fair argument tbh i have nothing to say
also dont refer to the other "critics" as critics unless its a big youtuber or a fairly good builder
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:01:22 your not wrong and thats the part about the server some people are what they say the are and others arent
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:04:36 same accept it was 2020 lol
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:07:22 ill show you rq
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:10:30 its that easy :)
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:12:31 ah that is dificult to explain idk how to do that tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-14 08:07:33 dam this shit aint doin numbers
creations-chat 2023-01-14 13:23:20 so i did this for a test
and i posted a few mins ago,
i think ive figured out the PCC lol
that and ive had that that ship for a while now and decided to post it
creations-chat 2023-01-14 13:58:20 mig 25 foxbat
creations-chat 2023-01-14 15:09:49 ima be real its not really that hard to figure out the PCC 
i did a test, with one of my jets and a advanced targetting pod numbers are
likes:2
dislikes, like 30
then i did a futuristic build and bam it was diffrent
creations-chat 2023-01-14 15:11:54 i didnt ask
and i really dont try and go for good pics i just try to go for showcase
creations-chat 2023-01-14 17:07:26 that was forever ago and i wasnt wanting to add more to it
creations-chat 2023-01-14 19:34:17 i think thats what tankers are
creations-chat 2023-01-26 13:18:15 yo hows this for a kc135 nose
creations-chat 2023-01-26 13:21:16 dont care about the locking, im allready working on making the nose smaller lol
also just a quick note its a plane based off of a kc135 its a mix between of an E3 Sentry and a KC 135 Stratotanker
creations-chat 2023-01-26 13:39:34 yo anyone know how i would make this, and again i say the plane is BASED off the kc135
creations-chat 2023-01-26 15:48:38 like i said, it is based off of the E3 sentry and KC 135
creations-chat 2023-01-26 15:57:28 theres not really much im not sure what you mean, i mean i would like to make it fully custom hence the 'based' part
creations-chat 2023-01-26 16:00:16 im just trying to make it a look-alike ime not really trying to copy much from the planes, this is a concept i made i know how to make it its just kinda confusing with the way i layed it out
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:25:58 thats how its done with most planes, f35, f22, f15, 16 etc. its common and makes more sense to put it on the upper fuselage
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:31:01 most of witch being attackers, its kinda nature for humans to put attacker/multirole guns on the bottom nose and fighters, for example, ww1 fighters, most of them have there gons on top/mid fuselage
ww2 was when we were learning planes, so we put them on the wings
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:33:54 tbh i kinda figured lol, it looked kinda like an attacker in a sense it wouldnt make sense for a fighter to not have a rudder
also an example of a b21 raider, bomber that has no rudder
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:37:54 yeah tbh thats kinda true lol, with the speeds we are getting to and the speeds we (had) being mach 3 i dont see much more advancement with maneuverability in planes with how fast planes are starting to get
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:40:28 ohhh that makes sense were you got that from now, yeah i can see that being used soon with the planes we have now you can kinda tell we are advancing because some planes rudders either get bigger or smaller, and the fact that we are developing planes or atleast trying to doesnt suprise me and it makes sense, less drag, more speed, overall some planes dont need rudders
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:44:11 i mean unmaned flight is allready being used in some things like recon drones and MQ-9s we might have few planes that actually have pilots in them (in what i think) by roughly 2035 we most likly we will have most planes being unmaned when it comes to fighters, it lowers the cost of training pilots we dont loose manpower as much and sometimes even just better with weight
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:48:37 i mean if im being honnest its just a better decision and we wouldnt loose as much manpower unless the flight facility gets bombed, of course we are gonna have to still have human "pilots" driving the drones from a distance buts thats just cause if an AI mistakes our troops for enemys we lose alot so its just not a great idea, and im sure in the future its gonna be like a video game, like warthunder, when it comes to flying i guess but missiles are advancing i doubt we would ever have propper dogfights i doubt they would put guns ment for planes on the drones im sure all military planes in the future will be "multi role" aka missiles for air and guns bombs and AG missiles for ground
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:51:06 i mean when it comes to ai there are lots of problems we have, as long as the enemy group has somthing that identifies enemy's from allies we still have a little way to go i guess
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:53:36 im sure that with how corrupt some governments are  some designs might fail and others that advance up the ranks, but with what we have now we will have to have human pilots piloting from a distance until we get AI to listen and not turn on us, we cant give some things there own mind it might turn on us and give us a huge disadvantage in a war
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:58:16 i can agree ai like jarvis just makes more sense, give it a voice so it can report back, give it (small) personality, and boom we have a pilot we just have to program some things into the ai that prevents it from turning, and im sure that with how we are doing this and how many planes the USA has we would just rip apart planes to make our new drones to make huge swarms for wars like they did with bombers in ww2. it would give some an advantage
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:01:07 and with how stealthy planes are getting they would most likely get detected to late that almost 100% of the armament would hit the target and cause a huge ruckus on the ground or ai but we would need to make the fuel or electricity on these planes a HUGE copacity with how far they would have to fly, with longer missions it just makes sense, granted planes get accross the atlantic and pacific in under a few hours all the time but fighters can maybe make it a quarter then they have to refuel, also the reson we have aircraft carriers
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:04:58 they should hire most of us lol we are coming up with some interesting designs im already thinking of ways people could make stealthy and fast designs lmao we could also probs make a design with more efficient engines and fuel to cross oceans faster at high speeds, a more slick fuselage would cause less drag leading to faster, and without a cockpit and the cockpit utilitys we could have more fuel, be lighter, and faster and slick without the cockpit window, having sharper edges on the plane and wings would = less drag like the sr71
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:09:32 i really wanna design a 6/7th generation fighter now lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:16:01 i agree tbh, i used to be "oh, fuck new planes they suck" nah bruh they are so underrated when it comes to planes, its sad people hate them
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:18:56 and i would say yes to this cause i play dcs all the time but, they dont make these planes they fly them. we could hire them as pilots but not engineers
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:21:38 and yeah tbh the pcc kinda makes jets seem overated but theres surprisingly not many actual future jets being made by people who are good at building, its only made by new players who can barly build, and they try to show off there builds and say "its the best. better that you" witch is probs the reson its "overated"
and i wanna work at tnorthrop grunman to engineer more neat bombers or lockheed martin to enginner fighters, not sure witch one i would choose tho
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:23:59 yeah they make most prototypes tho, they help engineer the bodys, i like skunkworks but i wouldnt work there, i wanna build the planes and (maybe) design them if i were to disign them id most likely work at skunkworks
tho tbh skunkworks is the first on my list to apply for a job with aircraft due to its just a good idea i guess
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:26:02 the crations chat has just turned into a general for engineers lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:28:05 i agree, the f16 is kinda overated,  theres a diffrent between hiding from a killer in plain sight and hiding in plain sight
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:30:08 yeah i have to agree its kinda annoying mianly when your helping someone and keep typing in short sentances
and i like the f35 but mainly just its design i like how alot of planes work like the eurofighter, but the way the f35 works is just kinda interesting
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:32:19 i feel like the eurofighter is slowly turning into a 6th gen fighter, its most European and Nordic countrys that make really interesting planes that i really like
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:34:23 yeah its kinda sad how cool planes are "overated" the planes i really like are j35 and the viggen, they work really nicely and i just love the viggens looks and how it works
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:36:27 i mean vtol aircraft have like 10% more crashes than non vtol so theres not much to say about the harrier crashing
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:38:42 i just love the sound of jet engines i dont know why, i think it must have been the first airshow i went too that you could feel the afterburner and it was just so loud its somehow a comforting noise to me im not sure why
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:42:13 the first one i went to i loved and was so worth it (a few months ago) havent been to one since, when you get the chance you should, its just kinda a place some people belong i guess, the airshow i went to was Chippawa valley airshow with the blue angels
ive never felt like i was ment to be somewere so much in one moment
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:45:03 that airshow is also how i found the love of tankers im not sure why i love tankers so much but they are probs my fav planes i got to sit in the cockpit and the refueling station, the plane was a KC-135,
theres also an "airshow" in my town ever year that contains a p51 p47 p40 and a p38 i think its really annoying the when they fly really low a few feet above your house tho lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:52:14 id like to see some planes built more often they are soo underated
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:54:47 i would like to see more sweedish and german jets, and less hueys
i really just wanna see more variaty in the PCC
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:56:52 ive been trying to make more varriaty in jets recently but i suck at building newer things so im just practicing i guess
also one of my freinds has that heli
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:58:54 bruh aint no way, we were just talking about more variaty in builds and someone is trying to post an f14, cringe
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:00:58 somthing that isnt seen as much lmao so many people have made f14 nobody is going to like it for a first build with motor lock
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:03:00 thats nice ngl also looks rlly big but the b29 is big in general so
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:06:46 ima try and make a viggen for once
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:08:55 i mean tbh i like the scale it allows more detail its just a little big to the roblox char but that doesnt really matter just as long as its good
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:10:59 im sorry THERES A 2 PERSON VIGGEN!?!?
and tbh it looks fine in the pick to me lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:13:16 welp looks like im making somthing that doesnt look real lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:19:00 wtf was that why was i pinged

creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:28:37 thanks
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:34:59 or 1 or 2 also i made your design a bit simpler
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:37:01 im not sure witch variant is better for a viggen nose
i feel like 1 is a little better but it doesnt look like a viggen
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:40:00 thats what im doing btw ima move the locking back a bit just under the 2nd pilots dome
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:45:06 lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:48:07 make it like a mig 29 or su27
creations-chat 2023-01-27 06:00:07 looks like some sr-71 type shit
creations-chat 2023-01-27 06:03:17 also turns out the viggen im making is a SK 37 its the viggen training aircraft
creations-chat 2023-01-27 06:18:18 so far on the nose, hid all exsposed motor lock so thats nice

creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:52:12 i mean have you had the problem of wing shape and have been trying to think if how to make a wing for about and hour
creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:56:22 i still dont think this looks right
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:04:12 ahhh thats why
thanks
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:16:42 bruh i posted like 2 seconds ago wtf
yalls are fast
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:18:45 thats a question for another day but i guess ill ask now, how do yalls even get ranks
and also i never asked for opions
i do not care what so ever
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:25:32 it its "plane crazy 2 ill dm you the link its a diffrent game
creations-chat 2023-01-27 11:16:20 do you not see the quotations
creations-chat 2023-01-30 18:48:51 yo is there any way i can make this nose a bit better, im struggling with the nose its a HU-16 Albatross
creations-chat 2023-01-30 18:56:47 ive made the nose slightly longer should i make it shorter or longer now?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 18:59:06 aight
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:01:29 this feels much more round what abt this
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:10:46 we dont know that :/
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:14:21 any good ideas on how to make a good pontoon design like this?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:18:45 ive tested it the pontoons arent the shape i want, i need an all the way around "circle" type thing
with the pontoons i can only get half of that shape so id preffer to use motorlock
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:50:51 i got a good design but thanks for the idea
creations-chat 2023-02-02 19:45:38 is there any way that i could make adjustable suspension? not using ropes?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 19:59:01 that was the only answer i was hoping not to get lmao
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:01:53 there are a few ways but its very janky with it and it will be a little glitchy with moving the road wheels
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:04:26 it also really comes down to how big i build it and i dont want it to be too big to where it cant pvp, i want it to atleast pvp
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:06:58 hinge systems wouldnt be a viable option and i know how they work just the strv would have to be pretty big for it to work
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:11:59 i might have to make this fairly big actualy, cause there is no actual system that would work with how small im trying to make it
however i see alot of tanks with this size so i will just have to find a way to pvp it
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:16:02 motor lock with the tank suspension i was trying to use and how small it was wouldn't even matter, it would just spaz out like it was a fish trying to walk on land
creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:28:30 then you cant post anything you have to be a lvl 5

creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:44:08 okay? so what, im wrong get over it,
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:46:37 use motorlock to tighten the tracks, or axtend the roadwheels with pistons or suspension
creations-chat 2023-02-20 18:02:10 mostly working t90

creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:22:18 my dumbass has been sitting here for a day trying to find a small compact design for a 6 bladed rotor
creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:24:30 this is the issue lmao, mini ah6m little bird,
all the tuts for thoes are way to big, either too tall or just dont work
creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:29:13 thanks, im thinkin on doin a 4 prop for now, then asking one of my other freinds for help for now
creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:39:32 im in a mini builds server, and i never make actual "mini" builds, should have made it a 3x15 but i made it a 2x12, i decided for a little challenge cause the little bird was built small in the first place
creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:43:16 cant tell if its mini, also dayum, thats so much better than me
also i think roblox broke, some mf spawned a lag machine, crashed my game, and i cant even join any servers anymore

creations-chat 2023-04-15 22:57:19 now onto the flight part <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
