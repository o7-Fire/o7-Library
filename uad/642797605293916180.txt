general 2023-03-25 09:43:11 why when on mobile do the buttons for my build not appear sometimes
general 2023-04-30 13:19:51 Anyone elseâ€™s ping go to like 20k+ when they load in any big build even if you have good wifi
general 2023-04-30 13:20:41 No my pc is good, my wifi is good and i can run really high demanding games with <100 ping
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 13:21:46 Maybe use disconnectors for the side panels since they dont have the little dots on them, however they are heavier
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 13:21:53 But nice build still
