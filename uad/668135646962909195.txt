plane-crazy 2022-07-04 14:58:23 In PC2, A possible feature idea could be the ability for other players to control parts of your build through pilot seats. You could link up certain parts of the build to a certain seat with the screwdriver tool and this would allow for super fun 2v2 pvp in planes with gunner seats and so much more. I'm not sure if this is extremely hard to implement but I believe it has tons of gameplay possibility.

plane-crazy 2022-07-04 15:01:41 Well it would be meant for multiple players. (you and a friend) and it would be great for bigger builds that have lots of different things that in real life would be operated by more than 1 person.
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 15:06:26 i wonder if it would be possible to link the scripts to the owners build and not through a trust menu
