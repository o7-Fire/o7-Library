plane-crazy 2020-11-06 20:05:39 dont mind that it's a plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 20:07:35 i wish they would add like an object destroying option that would basically make it so if objects collide with eachother or an object with terrain, it suffers damage or destruction
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 20:07:54 it would be quite good for roleplays

creations-chat 2021-07-13 20:27:12 <@!665059166221762581>  honestly, the carrier is unfixable, it's just way too small for any plane except the tutorial plane.

creations-chat 2021-11-15 19:41:44 could i get some opinions on the so far uss wasp cv-7
creations-chat 2021-11-15 19:46:48 alr ty ill take that into consideration
creations-chat 2021-11-15 20:01:22 roblox vc ü§î it came out like 3 days ago
creations-chat 2021-11-15 20:26:25 yes, you gotta verify some official paperwork, like an ID or passport to get it, after you do so you can enable it in the privacy settings

gotta be 13+ to get it

my parents were fine with it, no questions asked

if you mention that roblox is a multi-billion company and out of 1 billion players, why would they need specifically your docs <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
creations-chat 2021-11-25 11:19:33 any opinions on the bow shape of the yamato
creations-chat 2021-11-25 11:26:47 smoother as if?
creations-chat 2021-11-25 11:29:22 got it
creations-chat 2021-11-25 11:56:00 that's what i was building off of
creations-chat 2021-11-25 12:40:12 i see

however right now i am aiming to get the main shape going and if i happen to need to modify it i can always redo the bow later
creations-chat 2021-11-25 12:45:00 in my opinion it kind of resembles it, but any tips on how to make it closer to the yamato's
creations-chat 2021-11-25 12:49:35 thicc!
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:06:31 and so i made it thiccer in the bow, any opinions or tips to improve it?
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:43:00 but how about the updated bow, did it make a difference at all to resemble it closer
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:45:21 like 5

the perspective is weird
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:48:22 sure then, im gonna wait for shawn's sketch or whatever to see how it'd end up being
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:51:00 üëç  gonna work on it

creations-chat 2021-12-05 16:18:26 <@!688806157749715044>  i see what design you seem to be going for here, however, it just doesnt seem right to me, since i dont make customs all that often

heavily depends on their skill level, no one starts out as a god at building anything, you gradually learn
creations-chat 2021-12-05 16:20:51 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
creations-chat 2021-12-05 16:30:40 
creations-chat 2021-12-05 16:34:31 any suggestions on specific colors?
creations-chat 2022-02-01 13:28:26 <@!768450022156927014> the gun barrels seem to be a bit too short, also you could do a bit more with the details, the creation seems kinda plain, usage of signs, trails etc should help

a more diverse paint scheme could also help
creations-chat 2022-02-04 21:37:58 any opinions regarding the superstructure, it seem a bit bulky to me however it will take quite the time to modify it to a longer one (uss wasp cv-7)
creations-chat 2022-02-04 21:49:32 yo come on man
creations-chat 2022-02-04 21:52:17 grammar* yes
creations-chat 2022-02-04 21:56:54 you can't really call it much effort, it's moderate at best
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:41:32 chonky
creations-chat 2022-02-05 13:38:32 overall seems pretty good however to me the beige color is a bit too bright

makes sense however i think it wouldn't be bad to experiment with the beige color imo <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2022-08-02 11:16:01 should i use like half wedges to make it less jagged

creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:58:25 its pretty obvious why noobs dont post, creations that dont include any details whatsoever are gonna get pummeled with downvotes, people go to the <#384025409945337856>  channel to see something huge, detailed and amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:02:45 oh my god...
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:05:51 like his build was so shit that i was 100% certain he was trolling, no one seriously posts pride builds and expect a shit ton of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:08:32 they are defending their borders, obviously
an invasion from taiwan can come at any time because of these pesky americans!

creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:17:33 please dont post it, a flag isnt gonna boost your upvotes, especially if its another shitty pride flag

im actually concerned
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:22:59 #Vote <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:29:28 i warned you
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:31:44 i feel like any build, even if its a really good one, will get 15% less upvotes if you put a pride flag on it tbfh
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:35:07 the slightest bit of respect i had for pride disappeared when i saw what weird shit it had, thats why bruv
shit so bad that i cant even say it here
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:37:47 if this isnt a troll, which he most likely is and you are acting like this on a daily basis

creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:48:19 you are throwing out terms that almost no one understands except pride people like you, bozo
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:50:28 yeah those are simple terms, now that i read into them more, but you get what i mean - blatantly throwing out names is dumb as shit

creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:55:53 just another fan ridiculing your build, and probably your stupidity
creations-chat 2022-08-03 16:03:15 hype died down
creations-chat 2022-08-05 19:29:35 whaddya guys think of the bismarck so far?
yes, ill change the deck color later and maybe make the hull darker
the bridge is not finished yet
creations-chat 2022-08-05 19:32:31 <@694730952177483779> dayum thats a thick barrel
creations-chat 2022-08-05 19:38:58 hull not striped? or did you mean the deck
alr
creations-chat 2022-08-05 19:42:19 boney helicopter lmao
i love it
creations-chat 2022-08-05 20:54:53 oh yeah, im just planning to do the main ship shape for now and add most of the decorations when i know that this will even fit in the plot (which at this point i think it will)
creations-chat 2022-08-05 21:24:04 locked and folded the funnel, but im too tired to finish it today
(ill fix the striped deck tommorow)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:18:53 fixed deck design, now it doesnt have such visible stripes
res is bad but the new deck is way more visible in second picture
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:21:00 no, the edges are not smooth at all, and the colors seem a little too bright
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:23:02 thats called constructive criticism, you should get used to getting bad feedback, not only amazing feedback
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:27:38 i understand thats its a prototype, most likely to test the wing folding, flying etc etc, but you should make the wing bigger and the front wider (yes i know that im a very skilled artist, no autographs today)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:29:49 wdym too wide for pvp
some of my well-perfoming pvp planes have like 3 block wide noses
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:32:41 i can already tell that the wings are way too rectangular, what plane model btw?
the attempt at detail is nice but you should round up the wings
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:34:50 goofy plane LMAO üíÄ but the wings are rectangular, fine
creations-chat 2022-08-06 13:37:49 i totally agree, 100% agreement from my side
creations-chat 2022-08-06 14:02:02 i like how shit builds always get like 10+ replies but good builds usually get only a few if any <:empty:794431705070174238>

referring to that guy that paints his shitty builds in tiktok livery
creations-chat 2022-08-06 14:05:51 the guy took down his tiktok builds but here is one that made fun of his build <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:23:16 ah yes, its just like asking everyone to eat to stop world hunger
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:27:33 another solution is to shutdown <#384025409945337856> so no more shit builds<:kek:652566605028524033>

plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:06:53 there is like a 1% the release is getting held up as like a 'back to school' gift <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
but yeah there is very high chances we probably are not getting it by the end of summer
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:08:46 how about we just dont discuss about it cause like if it doesnt release by the end of summer all this hype is just for nothing lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:10:02 i know a game, that was first set to release in 2021, then got moved to may 2022, and after all that still got moved to october 2022
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:10:52 i heard that plane crazy 2 is coming out when gta 6 is
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:11:28 so just a little bit more time to wait <:bigyoshi:557242825301819423>
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:21:25 right now im thinking that building a roscale tank is easier than searching for 1 to build, like holy hell
plane-crazy 2022-08-29 19:22:06 i want it to be special, so probably not an abrams, and i even had to enlist war thunder's help to search<:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-08-30 08:25:01 about exposed motorloc?
creations-chat 2022-08-30 08:31:30 i forgot ss but new tracks, a little more sloped sides, and more detail at the front i think
creations-chat 2022-08-30 08:34:13 tbh yeah the motorlock isnt visible anywhere where you should be looking on the bmp, so its fine
creations-chat 2022-08-31 10:08:11 bro came up to me while i was building my bismarck, said " "

general 2022-09-03 17:18:20 guys my mother told me that plane crazy 2 is coming out tommorow <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-09-03 20:26:47 typical helicopter in ohio
creations-chat 2022-09-17 09:47:21 added some extra details to the bridge, some aa guns throughout the ship, and some paint change to the deck
the guns still suck
creations-chat 2022-09-17 10:26:16 thx
creations-chat 2022-09-17 10:50:16 ill repost the hull in a second cause i didnt make any changes to it
creations-chat 2022-09-17 10:55:04 yes planes, theres 1 in the hangar
boutta post the hull and plane, been busy
creations-chat 2022-09-17 11:02:23 hull and plane view, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE BACK??? it was normal i swear

also can someone tell me why the sparklers glitch out? they were originally straight
creations-chat 2022-09-17 11:04:40 oh btw regarding the back, the parts didnt load in, they are present in build mode but not present in flight
creations-chat 2022-09-17 11:07:39 they are mostly these complex shapes, and when i joined, my shirt didnt even load in, so probably game had difficulties loading them in
creations-chat 2022-09-18 18:57:58 my day has been so successful, i made someone lag outta the game when i loaded one of my 10k builds in a public server

creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:06:39 how does the bismarck in <#384025409945337856> have 16k blocks lul
i'd give it 8k blocks at most

creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:20:30 for some reason i immediately caught on why his first post was deleted lol
creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:33:43 my guy

cool boat for 2020, not for 2022, the standarts are way higher now
creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:38:42 what if im not trying to get a bitch bro, seems like a waste of time, id rather find sm1 i really love later on in my life, than to waste time on some loose relationship

creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:46:19 kriegsmarine* ü§ì
creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:49:21 you cant make the boats deployable (not sure if that was the intention at first)
but you can build 1 part on 1 side of the fold, 2nd part on the second fold, same thing with lifeboats
so like legos, the 2 parts of the searchboats snap together perfectly
creations-chat 2022-09-21 15:51:25 im afraid thats not possible especially with the amount of space that ur working with
creations-chat 2022-09-21 20:20:24 i agree
creations-chat 2022-09-22 19:22:04 <@438960075483250688> shinano looks pretty nice, the hull i mean
but the superstructure looks like it was made in 2020, you should like add trails, or rework the glass or some shit idk the bridge just looks horrendous
creations-chat 2022-09-22 19:57:37 blocky and severely lacking details
creations-chat 2022-09-22 20:02:29 wdym its not funny, bro posted a godly creation and u seem to show little to no respect towards his skill
general 2022-09-30 11:55:25 
creations-chat 2022-10-01 11:17:13 uss bainbridge cgn 25
yes, the bow is meant to be l o n g, the superstructure is moved more to the back
creations-chat 2022-10-01 17:18:16 random ass guy copying my experimental dogshit missile in a public server <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-10-01 17:28:07 turns out the design isnt so dogshit, cause it works pretty nice
creations-chat 2022-10-01 17:30:25 did that, and he is still trying to make a chinese version of my missile<:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-10-01 17:44:05 <@641526474519740446> jesus christ i just noticed your build
i dont know if it was intended to look shit or you made it shit as planned, but lord have mercy on my eyes
creations-chat 2022-10-01 17:48:57 do it<:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2022-10-01 18:00:36 progress on the uss bainbridge, the missile that i previously sent here was meant to be placed on this ship
creations-chat 2022-10-01 18:02:39 i know, i had that planned when i finished the bow, but i delayed that by a bit
creations-chat 2022-10-01 18:48:39 slightly angled bow acquired
creations-chat 2022-10-01 19:19:33 started in august 2020, so 2 years, i even have 1 of my oldest builds saved on my pc if i didnt delete it lol
creations-chat 2022-10-01 19:30:19 i deleted the picture of it a while back, but it was a 1 fold, probably 10 block wide aircraft carrier with an attempt to make it look like the nimitz
creations-chat 2022-10-02 07:58:13 cursed typhoon
the front is abnormally long compared to the stern
either 1. move the missile silos and superstructure more to the bow
or 2. cut a bit of the bow's length
creations-chat 2022-10-02 09:40:46 uss bainbridge cgn-25, just about finished, just gotta add the missiles and some minor details
creations-chat 2022-10-02 14:00:25 what do you guys use to power your ships, rocket engines or jet engines, or something else?
creations-chat 2022-10-02 14:33:27 turns out using conveyor engines to turn aint a good idea
creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:01:23 the plane just has a thick forehead
creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:16:30 anyone know how to fix these small gaps forming when the ship isnt anchored?
creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:22:51 puting lock on the folds would work, but since its a missile cruiser, it wont really work for this specific ship (specific fold of the ship has to be unanchored to launch missiles, but with the lock feature on, they all count as one big anchored part, so its pretty laggy everytime it comes to a missile launch)
creations-chat 2022-10-03 06:53:35 good or mid 2x2 door design
creations-chat 2022-10-03 06:56:07 you gon have to believe me that this opens all right, im just too lazy to film it open
creations-chat 2022-10-03 20:37:35 what ship should i make next
creations-chat 2022-10-03 20:43:10 any, destroyers, cruisers etc, maybe not the most modern warships since they dont have as many details as older ships
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 19:41:38 nahhh look at this i found one of my first builds, its back from 2020, i thought i deleted the picture

creations-chat 2022-11-09 15:07:49 the color of the deck looks more of a helipad style
if you arent building off a real thing which has that green color, i suggest using a color something like in the picture
creations-chat 2022-11-09 15:10:38 in that case, you could make use of a lighter green color, or just use Color Picker to get the exact color of the deck from the picture
(i use color picker often cause im shit at making colors myself)
color picker isnt paying me to say this
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 15:30:33 i only did an angled deck so far

plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:51:51 if you use wedges to build that bow im gonna personally smack you <:clueless:942802644043464734> 
but yeah like that
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:53:02 i meant straight wedges mate
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:53:25 
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:53:58 shit's on beginners level
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:54:36 then you can make it out of wedges, but 90% of the time anything with that type of bow structure doesnt look great
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 20:56:08 if i see somethin like this
