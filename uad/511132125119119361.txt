plane-crazy 2021-12-15 16:22:40 Why is Yamato's superstructure so complicated (I know it prolly isn't for some of the more experiences builders, but for me, it is.)
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 16:23:38 Plus im building it upside down
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 16:28:09 ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 16:29:25 true

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 16:34:55 not having a jetpack is flipping annoying

creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:48:06 Still work in progress but what do you think? (yamato)
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:50:10 What do you  guys think of my super structure? (for yamato)
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:51:43 Built it upside down :/
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:52:43 lets just say..... it took some time
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:53:13 too much... time
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:55:22 I know, i used motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:55:25 
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 18:58:03 Just hard to get blast bags and the fact that want them to elevate in such a small place
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:10:39 did you put motor 2 in accidentally?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:23:19 better?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:23:42 rip
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:24:42 hull inst polished **at all**
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:25:06 i can elevate them
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:25:37 that is why my turrets are so boxy
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:25:47 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:26:05 idk lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:26:42 it is a yamato
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:26:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:28:01 now its time to roast my superstructure lol ~~pain ~~

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 20:39:49 What do you guys think of my yama so far? (still very much work in progress, and nose too big)

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 20:44:10 haven't even touched painting yet it's just so my eyes dont burn out
