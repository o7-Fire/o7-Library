bug-reports 2022-01-21 11:21:57 Theres a bug that i dont know what the cause is but my mech’s cutters are not working in a pvp server or pvp in private server
bug-reports 2022-01-21 11:29:19 So uh what is a possible fix?
bug-reports 2022-01-21 11:29:53 Aw
help 2022-01-21 13:47:14 If he removes anchor the mech will uh die since it uses swing axe and a punch but oki we will try
help 2022-01-21 14:01:19 It did work but uh
help 2022-01-21 14:01:31 It made the mech less effective
help 2022-01-21 14:02:14 Any ways to add anchor back without cutter bug?
help 2022-01-21 14:03:00 Hes that type of guy
help 2022-01-21 14:03:30 He asked me if there can be improvements since the main weapon of his mech is a long axe
help 2022-01-21 14:05:22 This is his mech
help 2022-01-21 14:05:29 
help 2022-01-21 14:08:01 He is currently having problem with cutter anchor bug thing but when anchor is removed damage is back but it made mech less effective
help 2022-01-21 14:08:21 OHHHH HE ADDED HELIUM IN THE AXE
help 2022-01-21 14:08:27 This will really help him
help 2022-01-21 14:08:29 Thx alot
help 2022-01-21 14:09:26 Uh he uses axe swing attack from above and his mech cant do sideways swing
help 2022-01-21 14:09:51 But oki i will tell him to do it up wise
help 2022-01-21 14:40:26 Is there any way to be able to use anchor while not bugging? Cuz many of his mech uses anchor and still damages things
bug-reports 2022-01-21 15:42:27 Wait pistons affect the cutters and remove their damage? I use it on the legs
bug-reports 2022-01-21 15:42:43 Well his other mechs has damage even though with anchor
bug-reports 2022-01-21 15:44:16 The problem he have is that uhhhh yea his cutters dont do damage
bug-reports 2022-01-21 15:44:38 I know
bug-reports 2022-01-21 15:45:02 Ye
bug-reports 2022-01-22 01:50:02 He removed the pistons and uhh ye the damage is now back thx a lot
