creations-chat 2021-07-26 14:14:34 Beautiful
creations-chat 2021-07-26 20:57:48 --my pleasure--
creations-chat 2021-07-27 01:58:39 Well its a lot for me, as i am not that good at the game and generally new to motor locking and things like that
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:00:51 Sorry i meant to put spoilers not flaps
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:03:22 Sorry man im not the best in the game but this plane can outrun most generic shredder bugs, has incredibly good turn rates, and can pitch up and down incredibly quickly for its chunkyness. And tbh it could probably outfly and beat most player built c130s in this game
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:09:00 Decent looking maybe not but functional very very functional. And yeah technically i would be but i could out maneuver most of them
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:11:01 How do you suggest i do that, the plane is perfectly balanced. So yeah what should i do?
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:13:47 Like where, i wanted to make the top more round but the top is housing the motor lockage for the spoilers, and i dont really wanna ditch those although it is an option
creations-chat 2021-07-27 02:16:40 Yeah basicly they are control surfaces that raise opposite to eachother and slow the plane a little but
creations-chat 2021-07-27 04:31:00 Yes
general 2021-07-27 04:37:12 Hey in contests how come we cant build german planes?
