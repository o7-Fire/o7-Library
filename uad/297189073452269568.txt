plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:04:24 I'm lonely
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:04:27 looking to pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:04:31 Please no shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:10:08 this community is unofficial
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:10:28 Your best bet is https://twitter.com/Rickje139
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:13:20 so, turns out
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:13:22 the bot
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:13:25 hates my image host
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 23:13:56 dms
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 16:10:57 I use shredders against shredders, I just found a way to make shredder balls 40x more fatal, I won't release it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 16:12:37 u know what I mean I modified a shredder ball, and now its like 40x more deadly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:44:57 theres this fucking idiot in my server, whos using a massive lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:09 I hate kids who play this game
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:57 definition of pre-teen is 9-12
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:46:56 I wish you could votekick
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:48:37 I could get a fully functional votekick system coded
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:48:43 then hand it to rickje
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:48:52 I do know lua
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:50:55 i'm thinkin
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:51:00 half the server
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:51:11 has to agree
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:51:27 and you have to specify a reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:51:56 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:38 Alrighty, votekick cooldown, must specify a reason, half the server must agree
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:39 and
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:52 can yall think of any other issues
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:54:52 If its hardcoded, it just instance.news the whole game, thats my interpretation
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:55:02 the votekick wouldn't need to merge with the existing code
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:55:20 saves to autosave I guess...
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:56:19 using datastore service
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:56:21 hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:56:23 but possible
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:56:42 I already got my man whos great on UIS working on the UI
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:01:02 its my image host
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:01:05 It used fake urls
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:03:46 So, I found a captcha system
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:03:47 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/captchatheflag-protect-your-game-from-bots/648132
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:06:47 well, I'll be coding the backend of the votekick in serverscriptservice
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:06:52 and protecting the remotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:07:00 so no matter how hard you try
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:07:03 you can't vote twice
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:07:41 Yes?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:05 to roblox or discord?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:38 .mov cant be used on some devices
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:50 and can hide discord crashing bugs inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:59 I don't even have image perms
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:09:00 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:09:51 well, I've never heard of it, and plane crazy is my favourite game, so I would never exploit in it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:10:11 but having a picture of rick astley would be sweet
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:10:34 But knowing how most people who buy exploits are
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:10:49 exactly what I was gonna say
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:11:03 anyway, how do I get image perms?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:11:35 Ah, I see
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:11:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:12:10 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:12:42 with them getting removed, I wish I made massive blocks with 1x1 cubes of every material
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:12:45 so I can save em
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:14:00 I got my UI friend almost done the votekick ui <@!748702813948739725>
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:14:16 I'll DM u a picture of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:14:19 see if u like it

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 22:12:38 we need half triangle wedges 1x2 1x3 1x4

general 2021-08-17 18:51:10 thanks, good idea
general 2021-08-17 18:52:54 Alrighty, so I'll check if a majority of votekickers are friends

general 2021-08-17 18:55:29 each votekick would have to have a reason, that reason broadcasted in chat for the voting, and sent to a webhook
general 2021-08-17 18:55:58 <@456226577798135808> meh

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:37:40 I am mass producing shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:38:22 I recognize that, is ur design used in shredder balls?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:39:44 I'm just mass producing shredders for target practice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:41:49 I got a custom design that only works effectively against shredders, anything else, its shit at
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:42:17 thats da funny country I live in
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:43:15 got a design for a stupidly small plane?
