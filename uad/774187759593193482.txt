general 2022-07-29 01:39:29 I'd say a tank round is more like an arrow than a bullet
general 2022-07-29 01:39:53 or he might be talking about hesh or heat

creations-chat 2022-07-29 02:02:57 pretty much yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 02:11:00 should I make a 131 variant?

creations-chat 2022-07-29 02:15:07 while waiting for the creations chat to be back on, Imma troll using destroyers in wow
creations-chat 2022-07-29 02:52:18 No?
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 10:31:25 It may seem alot, but it wasnt really fully controlled, like most of their territories in south east asia was sort of puppet states
creations-chat 2022-07-30 05:14:18 I just woke up and saw that I got 142 upvotes from this
creations-chat 2022-07-30 05:16:24 **l a z i n e s s**, and the fact that I might rework it sometime
general 2022-07-30 05:17:48 I kinda want them to add a texture that is similar to marble, so I can recreate stefan from the last tiger campaign
general 2022-07-30 05:18:46 if they add a scale tool and a sort of move tool to make angling easy, that would be a builder's wet dream
general 2022-07-30 05:19:19 oh god
general 2022-07-30 05:19:36 cant they just take inspiration from build a boat?
general 2022-07-30 05:19:55 build a boat is technically the game with the best build mechanics but its grindy as hell
general 2022-07-30 05:20:24 its techically a building game now lol
general 2022-07-30 05:21:04 you can just make a long, hard afk machine to get inf gold lol
general 2022-07-30 05:22:37 I only like the scale tool and the ability to angle stuff
general 2022-07-30 05:23:11 pretty impossible, on 1:1 scale atleast
general 2022-07-30 05:23:37 it will probably be possible only if its like mega sized or something
general 2022-07-30 05:24:20 Bro
general 2022-07-30 05:24:27 I can stack tnt using that
general 2022-07-30 05:24:31 and make a actual nuke
general 2022-07-30 05:24:46 pc will explode
general 2022-07-30 05:24:50 go boom boom

general 2022-07-30 05:27:13 uh
general 2022-07-30 05:27:30 I wont question it
general 2022-07-30 05:28:56 this kinda makes me want to make a flying oreo that can go at mach 5 with super maneuverability and fire power that will make the a 10's loadout seem like childs play
general 2022-07-30 05:29:35 My braincells are just
general 2022-07-30 05:29:36 gone
general 2022-07-30 05:31:32 You know, the reason why you should spare the baby cows or sheep in minecraft after killing their entire herd, is that it would be filled with fear and traumatized, so when it grows up and gets slaughtered. its meat will be so full of richness and flavor that would make it worth it
creations-chat 2022-07-30 09:44:09 KMS Bismarck that I built around 2 months ago, and planning to do a full rework (Due to it flailing around, outdated building techniques, and just glitches)

general 2022-08-15 12:34:18 Tip for players wanting to be good builders: 
***"If it looks like a cancer tumor of motor locks, then its good"***
creations-chat 2022-08-15 23:16:20 Angle lock, if you want it to be very thin use half blocks
creations-chat 2022-08-16 02:21:35 this looks like a medieval torture device
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:41:37 I have the urge, to make a cursed camo for this....
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:44:01 hot 🥵
general 2022-08-16 11:55:57 Exposed motor lock....
general 2022-08-16 11:56:07 0/10
creations-chat 2022-08-16 11:58:13 Seems like an interesting future build idea 🤔
creations-chat 2022-08-18 12:35:12 this reminds me of that time when I was so bored in class i folded paper like 30 or 40 times
creations-chat 2022-08-18 12:52:19 It was a big sheet of paper-
creations-chat 2022-08-19 11:14:05 I'll try make the aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2022-08-19 11:32:33 it is.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 04:21:20 the guns should be inside of the turret other wise it looks pretty mid
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:38:51 progress with the carrier ( i will change how the catapults are put in cause it keeps on glitching)
creations-chat 2022-08-24 08:55:36 ideas? (catapult will be moved somewhere, its just there temporarily)
creations-chat 2022-08-24 08:58:11 Custom, its IJN Taiho modernized to 1960 standards

creations-chat 2022-09-08 01:47:58 I am just spawning in some of my old builds and he thinks Im flexing.... it all started when I spawned in my tiger and he spawned in his
creations-chat 2022-09-08 11:04:29 🥰
creations-chat 2022-09-10 00:00:14 I fucken knew that this was stolen, I literally saw the original build last month and inspired me to redo my Bismarck. Its a shame people do this ngl
creations-chat 2022-09-10 08:41:14 
creations-chat 2022-09-10 08:43:55 
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:41:54 Possibly its because of the good builders are busy
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:44:38 I mean for some people like me its exam week, there really isn't much time to build when your grades are on the line...
general 2022-09-11 12:47:10 planes that look like their malnourished?
general 2022-09-11 12:49:08 I have plans to make a darkstar, but I may do it during december cause I accidentally made the mistake of trying to make an me 262, a supercarrier and, a horten ho 229 at the same time... 💀
general 2022-09-11 12:50:03 today is exam week for me lol 💀
general 2022-09-11 12:50:47 it aint gonna be hard for me, well cause the subjects are pretty easy... until I get to the 2nd batch with math...
general 2022-09-11 12:51:08 Ah, math the bane of my existence
general 2022-09-11 12:52:33 I can somehow understand how a cluster of motor locks work, but cant understand how to do algebra
general 2022-09-11 12:53:48 make a stick of tnt and add a small propeller at the back
general 2022-09-11 12:54:39 You can try to add a cutter at the front for piercing, and wing panels at the back so it will glide in the air when it falls
general 2022-09-11 12:56:28 month/day/year
general 2022-09-11 12:57:33 the purpose of a date is for history or archive reasons...

creations-chat 2022-10-04 11:33:13 For some reason when im really busy I want to build something, then when my free time arrives my motivation is just gone
creations-chat 2022-10-04 23:17:04 The wings look too thick
creations-chat 2022-10-05 09:20:38 Remake the entire damn thing, the wings should be half a block taller and use motor lock to fill in the ugly gaps between the fuselage and the wings
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:03:27 I'm on my damn phone rn, I'd show pictures but what I said was right, the whole thing needs to be reworked
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:08:51 Its not like your giving useful feedback anyways, and like what I said, I'd have a better time explaining it on my PC, and saying that I am not a decent person when I'm actually trying to help these new people unlike you people who just laughs at them?
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:13:06 The mods are only here to moderate, if the mods are here to help new players on how to build properly they should be named helpers instead. Wasn't it supposed to be the creations chat that was supposed to help them and yet it turned into a circus to make fun of them?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 06:06:18 Should I go for a cylinder cockpit or a wedges cockpit for my su 57?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 08:19:03 Su-57 [WIP]
creations-chat 2022-10-06 08:23:14 springs and the remants of a half block ladder because the motor lock tower got too high

creations-chat 2022-10-06 09:35:47 I'll try to make it more smooth
creations-chat 2022-10-06 10:42:00 I guess thats better
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:00:41 Time to rework it again i guess
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:40:36 I just need to smooth it out (I just realized I was looking at the wrong angle when using reference images 💀)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:46:23 I need to shorten it again do i
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:50:50 Better? or does it need more tuning?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:53:43 Sorry for the unintentional scarring with that horrific nose btw
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:56:48 do I remove the extra angle (The one that is protruding out of the top of the nose) or keep it? 

<@504577008383033344> aight
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:00:03 I may have made it look more like an f22 than a su 57 (Possibly made it more stealthier ngl)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:05:58 Actually the reason why I sucked at  making the nose was because this is my first modern jet that I made 
(My best looking plane being the bf-109)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:08:50 Literally went from mono planes to 4.5 gen jet fighters real quick

creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:58:38 Thoughts? (I'll try to smooth out the front)
creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:16:02 ?

creations-chat 2022-10-22 09:24:22 No one cares about that, looks and complexity is regarded highly, and magnetic drives, conveyor drives are just the stuff that literally have tutorials for them. stuff like a working calculator, although ugly. but if it works it will be very well liked.

creations-chat 2022-10-26 23:40:42 <@577930642520801301> Looks nothing like it, The engines dont even protrude out, the fuselage needs to be elongated and the width increased a bit, also dont use that type of control surface, it looks ugly. use control surfaces and motor lock it into the wings so its not seen
