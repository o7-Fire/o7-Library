the-dump 2020-12-20 01:02:38 The browning came with and additional tripod for ground support
the-dump 2020-12-20 01:02:44 lol
the-dump 2020-12-20 01:03:17 The browning was used in planes such as the P-36, P-48, and some variants of the P-51

the-dump 2020-12-20 01:04:49 Nono on the islands aswell

the-dump 2020-12-20 01:05:50 It would frequently overheat due to not having a cooling system because it was an aircraft gun

the-dump 2020-12-20 01:07:24 Yes and they overheated a lot
the-dump 2020-12-20 01:07:39 But they were M1s I believe
