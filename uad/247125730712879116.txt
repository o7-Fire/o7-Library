plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:33:23 k
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:33:41 well anyways i managed to make something with only 5 blocks fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:34:48 yes but mainly in block count, area wise it is on the larger end
general 2021-02-01 03:44:46 wew lad
the-dump 2021-02-17 05:16:05 A friend and i have invented a new type of dumb vehicle
the-dump 2021-02-17 05:16:42 dubbed the swordfish, it may either end up in the same category as shredders or be an anti shredder weapon
general 2021-02-17 05:18:19 how do i check what level i am and hw much more i need to get image perms?
general 2021-02-17 05:18:56 dios mio
general 2021-02-17 05:19:11 plane crazy needs a fence or post type block
general 2021-02-17 05:19:42 i need a block either cylindrical or rectangular of similar size to sparklers
general 2021-02-17 05:19:52 trails too thin
general 2021-02-17 05:20:31 i dont want their little square base xd
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 04:21:43 gentlemen
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 04:21:48 i have done the math
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 04:22:12 the longest solid plane you can make in plane crazy is ~4000 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 04:22:23 theoretically
general 2021-10-24 03:27:19 so i need lvl 3 for image perms?
general 2021-10-24 03:27:33 how do i check my lvl?

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 00:37:32 oi lads
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 00:37:38 quick question
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 00:37:53 do yall have any tips on making a dragonfly based ornithopter?
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 00:38:43 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 00:38:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:55:12 ive begun to notice that other peoples builds go through my cutterblocks without harm in pvp for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:55:16 why
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:55:18 how
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:59:35 im actually running something called a swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:59:44 shredders are crinj
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 00:59:56 aight
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 01:02:00 
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 01:02:43 
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 01:02:43 <@!581412939223924767>
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 01:04:08 what im referring to is the wall of cutters i have on the back of my craft
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 01:04:32 none of these cutters spin
general 2021-11-18 01:06:12 plane crazy rock paper scissors= omni bug beats shredder, shredder beats swordfish, swordfish beats omni bug
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:29:29 how many studs do i have to travel for plane crazy to crash?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:30:07 cause im going over a million studs/sec and accelerating about 1000studs/sec
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:30:23 wait
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:30:28 how is it infinite?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:31:11 is it the way plane crazy stores location data?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:31:26 or does location data cease to exist at a certain height
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:32:50 thats exactly what im doing right now
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 04:33:33 my vessel is nothing more than pixel art rn as it has fully compressed into 2D
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 22:40:47 so whats the differences between the test server of plane crazy and the normal game?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:49:38 help i cant open my own trapdoors by clicking on them anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:50:42 can anyone help me?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:59:33 TONK REMASTERED
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:59:59 
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:02:23 
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:02:24 added the front wings as requested
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:03:16 it flies disturbingly well
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:28:38 will there ever be a cannon style block?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:30:46 has it been suggested before?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:33:12 looks like it has been suggested alot
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 07:33:56 but my idea is a tad different for it
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 06:15:37 Ive just invented the smallest conveyor engine setup
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 06:17:23 
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 06:18:11 two conveyor engines facing eachother, one regular block, and one unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:13:44 well
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:13:49 so ive done some tests
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:14:24 that micro conveyor engine has the same output as a large dual motion conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:14:38 welp drag races are now insta winnable
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:17:31 are conveyor engines still the fastest engine in plane crazy rn?
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:04:48 gentlemen
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:05:00 i have updated my micro conveyor engine for stability
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:05:22 
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:06:12 This 2x2x1 thing can officially power any thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:06:19 any speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:10:17 any questions?
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:15:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:15:59 how ever i reccomend stablizing the thing with more unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:16:26 one conveyor block needs to be solidly connected to the rest of the craft in some way
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:20:21 cursed but cool
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:20:23 blursed
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:23:51 also another version of the design
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:24:12 
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:24:54 how it works:
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:25:07 
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:25:19 two conveyors pushing against eachother lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 08:26:26 
general 2021-12-25 23:22:51 Anthrax is good, my favorite song from them is "got the time"
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:27:27 how does piston locking work?
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:28:20 i am on the verge of inventing a one time use teleportation device on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:29:04 you can already assume it is a highly unstable prototype
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:29:38 yes but im talking about teleporting from a specific place to another thats predetermined
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:30:08 because i dont understand the depth of pistons
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:32:54 that is alot cooler but a different setup using similar mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:33:11 my teleportation is manual
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:33:21 you have to hit a key for it to activate
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:40:51 welp i finished it
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:40:55 kinda
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:33:51 help
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:34:03 i caught someone using exploits to destroy peoples builds in pve
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:35:13 YEP
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:35:23 using some strange piston exploits
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:35:48 to teleport people to the bottom of the map instantly upon contact with creation'
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:36:02 no matter what vehicle youre in
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:36:15 PVE
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 08:42:14 he immediately teleports you to the void
