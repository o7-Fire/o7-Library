plane-crazy 2023-03-22 01:33:42 Should I build something relative to SR-71 or Mig-29?
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 01:55:32 I mean like
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 01:55:35 Alright
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 01:55:52 It won’t actually be an SR-71 tho, just one that resembles it
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:34:57 What’s the distance of a block, for a piston?
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:36:13 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:40:19 I did that and didn’t work
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:40:29 But I did 2.5 and it works almost
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:40:34 So i did 2.55
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:40:37 It’s 2.55
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 23:41:35 Unless my computer is really broken to the point where it doesn’t operate correctly for me
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:57:56 How do i stay motivated to my builds other than listening to bury the light by casey edwards?
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:59:36 Why would I listen to twitter’s theme song?
