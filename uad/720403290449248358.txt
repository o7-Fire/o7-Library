general 2022-01-06 06:20:22 cool
general 2022-01-06 06:20:51 make a torpedo kinda thing and then put a camera on top. perhaps make it controllable with tailfins as well
general 2022-01-06 06:21:22 and then you can steer it while looking through the camera or something
general 2022-01-06 06:21:55 does that involve a motor 2?
