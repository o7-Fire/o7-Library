help 2020-01-04 02:41:19 Any thoughts?
help 2020-01-04 02:42:11 
help 2020-01-04 02:45:53 I would rather use A magnet drive because it is easier to control the aircraft; also, they aren't too laggy if you only use one, so I use them on my smaller builds. That why I'm asking, because this has never happened before.

creations-chat 2020-12-10 03:58:12 <@456226577798135808> any feedback on my sparviero or???
creations-chat 2020-12-10 04:01:05 The I tried to make the coloration as accurate as possible for the scheme I was attempting to emulate, but I understand it to be unflattering for the aircraft. As for the holes in the wings, they are purposeful, made with control panels so as to create the Italian insignia. I could try motor locking to fix gaps in the wings. Thanks for the help!
