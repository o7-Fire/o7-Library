general 2023-03-21 11:55:29 I am writing this letter to apologize for using bad language towards you. I know that my  words were inappropriate and disrespectful, and I am deeply sorry for any harm or hurt I may have caused you.

I understand that using bad language is not acceptable, and it is not the way to communicate with others. I should have been more respectful and mindful of my words, and I regret that I failed to do so.

Please know that I take full responsibility for my actions, and I am committed to making things right. I want to assure you that I will make every effort to ensure that such behavior does not happen again in the future.

I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my actions. I understand that it will take time to regain your trust, but I am willing to work towards rebuilding our relationship.

Once again, I apologize for my behavior and any hurt that I may have caused you. Thank you for taking the time to read
