plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:39:49 Bunker got moved more and more under
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:40:04 its now about 4-5 blocks underground
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:41:14 give me an idea about how to destroy this bunker
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:41:24 without making one myself
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:41:48 doesn't work
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:42:03 I already said that I dropped a tnt plate on its top
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:42:17 He has tnt as roof
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:43:25 Motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:45:54 Very useful against large swarms of shredders
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:45:57 as its supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 06:50:34 its INSIDE the map
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 08:38:12 hmm.......yes
Me and tony is about to make 2 underground base and connect with railroads
Atleast underground rail works
just that connecting is quite hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 08:44:07 I really like  it when a shredder swarm try to phase through the ground but they cant
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 08:44:15 and eventually got stuck
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 12:49:17 Underground bunker complex
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 12:50:33 easier
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 12:50:36 no need to move
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 12:50:57 me and my friend
