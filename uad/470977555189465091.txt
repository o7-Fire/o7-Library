plane-crazy 2022-09-11 14:10:27 Basically, i want the motorcycle wheel to turn and i tried a solution which does not work ( using motor 2 ). Also the wheels wont spin when something is attached to them and i cannot have it unattached bc then it will not be weld with the bike. I am using cylinder and motors for wheels.

plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:43:55 How?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:44:10 I was never on your topic
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:44:43 Bc tuts = no creativity = game useless
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:44:53 In my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:45:08 ‚Ä¶
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:45:09 Read

plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:46:11 If you actually read this you will understand
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:46:20 You only read the last part
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:47:25 Tutorials should stay ofc, but they are hated
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:49:00 But like the game is basically made for creativity, if you use tutorials or copy people then the game would be useless for that person
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:50:01 Put whatever kind of block and then use ‚Äútext‚Äù

plane-crazy 2022-09-23 15:42:31 I took them
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 18:23:04 How do i make so that it doesn't "dingle" freely? Ik the reason it does so is because of the pistons but i need to keep them and hope to find a better way to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 18:23:12 Any solutions?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:14:00 th is that?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 12:57:28 So i made this tiny sub, it almost works but for some reason it tips back. I guess bc there is more weight on the back than the front. I have tried to put a ballast block with very mininum density but then it tips forward. Anyone know how to fix this?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 13:08:55 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 13:09:18 I made the wings bigger so the blue and yellow line match, but the tip problem remains.

plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:10:42 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:10:59 I'm gonna need a tutorial for that. Ima do it
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:43:15 Hey so i wanna learn to make planes and stuff. For testing i made this plane and what seems to be the problem is that the control surfaces at front and the back don't match. Both are using mouse movement but go different directions. Anyone know how to fix this?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:43:22 
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:44:48 Im talking about up and down
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:44:58 These
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:45:08 Dont match with these
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:45:30 But i can't go up
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:49:12 I dont think that's the problem
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 21:49:21 i added more but 0% difference

plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:41:50 sure will
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:44:52 I have no idea how i am supposed to make this, this was a stupid idea
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 19:15:45 Don't mind the model, i suck at building. How do i make the blue center with yellow? It goes down very slow but up fast and it's not as stable as it could be. Fyi the yellow parts are control surfaces.

plane-crazy 2022-10-04 20:54:58 Why does my plane controls sometimes change to the oposite? It's not always but sometimes when im flying a plane it lifts on the mouse going down instead of up and so on. You get it

plane-crazy 2022-10-05 22:27:32 Don't mind how it looks. I'm trying to get the basics of a helicopter before i actually build one. I made this simple thing as my first "helicopter" to test if it works. Obv whenever i make something it doesn't work, anyone know how the propellers should be made so that it can lift?
