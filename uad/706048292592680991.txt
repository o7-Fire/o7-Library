plane-crazy 2023-04-11 06:24:42 I'm just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue where angle lock takes like 20 years to lock, and if you mess up the tiniest bit on something while spawning, the whole build will glitch out
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 06:24:56 its like the build is lagging but not fps
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 06:26:02 it goes with piston lock too
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 06:26:53 and i also notice the disconnector piece that's supposed to fall into the ground just keeps floating for an entire minute
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 06:32:35 oh alright <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 23:03:55 Hello, I've had this problem for the past 2 weeks that I don't know how to fix, and it's really affecting my 777 progress. When I try to angle lock, the motor's don't lock for an entire minute, and when they do they never lock in the correct place. Sometimes they just never lock at all. I also notice that when I press the disconnector key, the piece that's supposed to fall into the ground just keeps floating for a whole minute.
The despawn button also just stops working, and my entire game is kinda just broken.

If you want a video for a better understanding, DM me (cuz i dont have perms here <:empty:794431705070174238>)
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 01:10:14 I've built a 777 before that had around 6600 blocks and it worked completely fine
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 01:10:29 im also working on a massive 747 that's 8000 and its good too
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 01:10:47 idk why just this plane is literal hell to spawn
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 01:13:02 bruh i have an insanely motorlocked f-14 thats working good too (theres like 300 motors)
i just wish i had image perms to kinda show what i mean

bot-central 2023-06-29 02:08:34 Oh
bot-central 2023-06-29 02:08:35 lets go
creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:04:23 alright thanks for the motorlock and color suggestions, ill use those soon. but for the proportions part, I researched pretty much every part, including the landing legs, and I think I built everything correctly
same goes for the engine layout
creations-chat 2023-06-30 06:42:10 Yeah, we both built it pretty similarly.

Look again though, I have a different engine layout, longer landing legs, the legs and grid fins are rotated differently, and the fairing is shorter.
If ur still skeptical, I can DM you the rocket in build mode and compare it to his. (I'm not home rn so it'll take a while)
creations-chat 2023-06-30 07:25:40 Oh, thanks

plane-crazy 2023-07-19 13:23:55 <@594118415384313856> Sorry I think I meant the flaps. The shape is just very off.
Try putting light blocks inside the rocket, probably in the center. Then when you turn them on, it might light up the vehicle like it's ice (this is so you're able to remove the ice later during flight, since obviously the ice won't be there forever). hope that makes sense, I don't know how to explain things
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:11:36 sorry for late reply lmao

I'm not near my PC for now so I'll just post a few of the pictures I took a while ago
