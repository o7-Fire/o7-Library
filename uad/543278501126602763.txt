creations-chat 2021-11-12 23:02:58 just letting you know it will be glitchier to have a bomb bay with motorlocked bombs in it
creations-chat 2021-11-12 23:07:46 cause if you're flying and you open the bomb bay and drop the bombs there is a pretty good chance it will get stuck in the plane. unless you have a very big bomb bay

help 2022-07-01 04:14:00 anyone know a compact angle lock design i could learn
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 04:30:33 opinion on track layout, its for a t80 (ignore the motorlock ill hide it somehow) also which looks better
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 04:31:47 
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 04:47:03 no suspension too lazy and too complicated for small tank
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 04:53:56 too lazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 05:29:50 lunch box
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 06:23:15 lunch box
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 01:44:08 how many wheels should a t80u have
plane-crazy 2022-08-05 16:48:09 how wide and how long should i make roscale panther tank
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 01:01:54 how do you make a compact panther d turret
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 01:05:20 no
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 01:05:36 they usually give me exposed motor lock 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 17:22:27 autoloader protype idk
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 17:22:45 could use some thoughts or ideas
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 18:01:02 https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/WbrvrYB_RHH3p/d1337qZS2nDP?invite=cr-MSxYTU0sMjY0ODUxNzgs
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 18:01:29 i havent set individual keybinds yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 18:03:11 also i havent made a barrel yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 19:03:03 ye
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 20:54:29 unfinished...
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 21:07:08 what game is that
plane-crazy 2023-02-20 21:07:28 i see
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:57:40 i just put cylinders and disconnectors along with some rockets or propellors and call it a day lol
general 2023-02-21 07:25:24 who uses shredders nowadays
general 2023-02-21 07:25:48 i havent seen a shredder since like early 2022
general 2023-02-21 07:26:32 all i see are either sweaty super maneuverable aircraft flying at mach jesus or the hellspawns with blocks everywhere
general 2023-02-21 07:27:14 guided missiles suck ngl
general 2023-02-21 07:28:00 pvp servers are literally so laggy that the detonation from tnt doesnt reach the specific target (unless they're still)
general 2023-02-21 07:28:40 i mean it's possble but controlling it would be hell
general 2023-02-21 07:28:46 all that weight on one missile
general 2023-02-21 07:29:27 speed isnt a problem, controlling it is
general 2023-02-21 07:29:58 yeah
general 2023-02-21 07:30:12 i mean i rather use a motorlocked bomb rather than a missile
general 2023-02-21 07:30:16 or a guided bomb
general 2023-02-21 07:30:31 boats are easy
general 2023-02-21 07:30:43 theyre usually fat and slow
general 2023-02-21 07:30:52 a few bombs can take care of em
general 2023-02-21 07:31:40 i have attempted to make an armor piercing guided missile before
general 2023-02-21 07:31:48 kinda worked against flat surfaces
general 2023-02-21 07:31:51 but overall unreliable
general 2023-02-21 07:32:44 go ahead
general 2023-02-21 07:32:52 ive been thinking of making a railgun
general 2023-02-21 07:33:09 or you can make like a scatter gun
general 2023-02-21 07:33:12 with magnets and tnt balls
general 2023-02-21 07:33:29 wait you know those builds that fling
general 2023-02-21 07:33:37 when it comes into contact with another
general 2023-02-21 07:34:02 what if you just launch that at something
general 2023-02-21 07:34:15 at a very high speed
general 2023-02-21 07:34:50 i mean imagine
general 2023-02-21 07:34:56 just seeing a giant battleship
general 2023-02-21 07:35:08 then seeing some projectile come into contact of it at mach whatever
general 2023-02-21 07:35:17 and seeing it getting flung into the air
general 2023-02-21 07:35:29 might be viable
general 2023-02-21 07:35:30 idk
general 2023-02-21 07:35:33 too lazy to build
general 2023-02-21 07:36:42 oh yeah
general 2023-02-21 07:37:06 what if you just launched a conveyor engine at a target
general 2023-02-21 07:38:48 lemme see
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:39:14 ur gonna need more speed and controls
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:39:30 u also need that at the front
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:39:48 oh
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:40:13 well move the tnt near the front
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:40:57 because the front of the projectile is more likely to get stuck into the target
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:41:03 compared to the whole projectile
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:42:05 that’s more like a shrapnel missile than an ap missile but oh well
general 2023-02-21 07:43:41 god bless america 🇺🇸🦅
general 2023-02-21 07:53:07 california is the best state (please help me IM STUCK HERE EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AND THERE’S FIRE EVERYWHERE)
