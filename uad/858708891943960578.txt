plane-crazy 2023-04-07 18:32:38 I'm looking up tutorials on how to do locks, You can look forward into seeing better versions of the Queen Elizabeth carrier soon :"D
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:15:33 Sorry if its THAT ugly I guess 😭
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:20:56 The visible motors and the ugly radar 😔

plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:21:50 I was talking abt the stuff I need to fix abt my building! ty for the tips tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:22:20 I'm pretty new to the game and anything helps rlly
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:52:03 I've had this build out for awhile, I still don't know why i added turrets on an aircraft carrier, its pretty bad but its my first build so-
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:53:04 Thanks! Its just the turrets are big enough to fit a small destroyer, I should've made them smaller :"D
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 19:59:19 Applies with media too, Trends and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:23:52 what's happening...
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:25:19 do yall have any tips on how I could hide off motor locks?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:26:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:28:30 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:29:59 alr ty
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:09:48 Ship hulls are always so complicated <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:20:33 This hull is a nightmare <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:29:37 The first motor lock finally worked 🫶
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:31:17 Thanks, pretty ugly rn but it'll be better dw
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:38:58 How should I hide motor locks that Is gonna add in the middle of a runway?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:39:12 omg my grammar <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:40:09 How should I hide motor locks that would usually appear in the middle of a runway (carrier) which is completely flat (means I can't add silly shapes to hide the half of it sticking out).
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:40:59 I wasn't aware of that being possible\
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:41:16 Oh sorry, I'm not really doing that yet, just a question for the future
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:42:11 Oh, sorry. I just wanted a heads up. Oh well I'll ask about it again when I'm actually doing it. Sorry!
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:43:50 I guess I'll hide them in the island, though i really wanted interior for it. I guess it can't be helped
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:45:51 yup... I could pretend its those mooring line things
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:46:32 The bow is so chaotic oh my
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:48:58 Oh I just copied this image the best I can, thanks for the advice though. I'll try to implement it but the motor locks inside make it really hard to change the shape.
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:57:58 I couldn't find any other carriers of interest so i just decided to remake my elizabeth, I'm planning on adding actual working mechanical parts like the elevator and phalanx guns.
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:00:09 I don't know how i'd make it float though
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:03:19 That sounds really nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:05:52 I finally finished the motor locking part <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:06:15 Theres more to come though <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:07:38 Its not, i was lying to myself. Even if the bow is done theres still the island motor locking and the runway <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:10:16 Isn't it supposed to be plane crazy content
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:11:15 Go wows on your carrier and add your own non - piloted jets that you can drop bombs with! 🫶
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:13:07 Anything is possible if you have friends!
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:13:15 Emphasize on the "if"
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:13:25 ***if***
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:14:43 Just call then drones I guess <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:16:18 I hope people actually land on my revamped qe instead of accidentally running over the water bc the runway is "too thin"...
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:17:26 I hope I can fix these ugly radars too <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:18:37 Yup
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:19:26 Don't worry, its not like I got the name wrong or anything <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

general 2023-04-09 16:17:06 Is that concorde
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:19:04 do magnets guarantee the build won't fall apart? cause I'll definetely use that method
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:22:34 oh well, I'll stick to this since I'm familiar with this folding technique, I'm not a very good builder so I don't expect my build to be comparable to other people's builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:26:22 how do you do that with fat builds like carriers?
