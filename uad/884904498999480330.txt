general 2023-04-13 01:58:32 i have question
general 2023-04-13 01:59:55 theoretically if i made a plane added a bunch of hover engines and it was soo fast the plane wobbled mid air could this problem be fixed by the perfect placment of ballist blocks while maintaining a high level of speed?
general 2023-04-13 02:01:07 so if i add more wings that will fix the problem?
general 2023-04-13 02:01:14 k
general 2023-04-13 02:02:25 could i motorlock the wing pannels out of sight *eg into the plane* rather then actually having to attach them to the side of the plane?
