creations-chat 2020-07-01 13:22:08 because it doesn't fly correctly :(
help 2020-07-01 13:44:54 camera's disappear when you go into flight mode, says I never insinuating that it is a bug
help 2020-07-01 13:45:08 that's all I actually know because I was trying to use their shape to support a gun
general 2020-07-01 15:55:26 Wtf is helium I only have like 36 hours on this game
general 2020-07-01 15:55:46 I know what it is
general 2020-07-01 15:55:54 But what are the ingame mechanics
general 2020-07-01 15:56:26 So can I use it to just lower the weight?
general 2020-07-01 15:56:30 Gotcha
