bot-central 2020-11-18 18:09:01 How do I get a rank
general 2020-11-18 18:16:37 Can I get someone to suggest something for me or are we not allowed?
general 2020-11-18 18:20:02 <@456226577798135808> Ok that would be sick if you could. Basically I was gonna suggest a feature to where you can build with someone on your friend's list. I wanna be able to help my friend build a plane and he needs help. Also you could set it to where you can either turn their building off and make it to they can delete items **with your permission**. If you can suggest this, thanks. Sorry if you had a stroke reading it
general 2020-11-18 18:20:38 <@456226577798135808> Is a whitelist being added?
general 2020-11-18 18:20:54 It says I need a rank
general 2020-11-18 18:21:15 Why not?
general 2020-11-18 18:21:40 Who said that then
