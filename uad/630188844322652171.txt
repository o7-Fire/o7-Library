the-dump 2021-08-21 12:05:09 Itâ€™s nice to think that on the left image one spin of the wheel will screw the ship and get it to run aground
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:44:58 i also have that issue but idk how to fix
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:45:07 its made basically all my aircraft unflyable
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:46:39 the motors work fine on the ground
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:46:46 but the moment i get into the air, they just break
general 2023-04-04 07:48:35 oh wait its happening to most people then
general 2023-04-04 07:48:59 i can't fly any of my aircraft
general 2023-04-04 07:49:06 i'm limited to the few tanks and ships i've built
general 2023-04-04 07:49:37 alright
general 2023-04-04 07:49:52 one of my friends joined the server and all his aircraft were working fine yet they used motor 2's
general 2023-04-04 07:49:58 so is it just certain people or something
general 2023-04-04 07:50:18 yeah figured
general 2023-04-04 07:51:28 fr fr ong
general 2023-04-04 07:51:42 i've been in the server for about a year now and only decided to speak now
general 2023-04-04 07:52:17 what aircraft carrier are you building
general 2023-04-04 07:53:37 i only have like 2 ships i've built
general 2023-04-04 07:53:43 HMS Renown in her 1942 fit
general 2023-04-04 07:53:47 and a type 45 destroyer
general 2023-04-04 07:55:11 nice
general 2023-04-04 07:55:24 i mostly build ww2 aircraft
general 2023-04-04 07:55:37 but like its mostly fighters
general 2023-04-04 07:55:46 i have a lancaster
general 2023-04-04 07:55:54 but i was told to watch a tutorial for the guns
general 2023-04-04 07:57:14 do it
general 2023-04-04 07:57:55 i need to make more warships
general 2023-04-04 07:58:05 i might build HMS Illustrious
general 2023-04-04 07:58:45 or just some british warships
general 2023-04-04 07:59:34 nice
general 2023-04-04 08:01:57 making warships in plane crazy is next to useless as most people will just bomb it
general 2023-04-04 08:03:06 i dont
general 2023-04-04 08:03:13 i build for use in private servers
general 2023-04-04 08:03:31 but even when people say they wont attack, i still find bombs raining from the sky
general 2023-04-04 08:05:07 yeah i'm gonna build HMS Illustrious
general 2023-04-04 08:05:37 gonna make the flight deck out of tnt for that armoured flight deck
general 2023-04-04 08:08:22 im pretty sure TNT can't be destroyed by anything that isnt tnt
general 2023-04-04 08:12:05 oh no, i wasnt making the carrier for pvp
general 2023-04-04 08:12:13 more just for messing around in private servers
general 2023-04-04 08:12:26 but i was told from a friend that tnt is good for armour against rockets
general 2023-04-04 08:15:57 rip
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:41:02 So is it fixed or not?
general 2023-04-10 04:18:44 i have a question for anyone who wants to answer, i built a HMS Illustrious should i make it drive?
general 2023-04-10 12:32:30 Are conveyer engines good for ships
general 2023-04-10 12:32:39 As I put one in my ship but it just forces the bow down
general 2023-04-10 12:32:48 Good if I want to sink the ship
general 2023-04-10 12:33:10 I canâ€™t get good speed with rockets
general 2023-04-10 12:33:52 Eh I should probably worry about moving the ship when my carrier is done
general 2023-04-10 12:34:06 I was told to add an emergency net ðŸ’€
general 2023-04-13 20:55:17 man why are british cruiser turrets so goofy to build ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-04-13 20:56:48 maybe people wouldnt have been so harsh if he had've made it known he was a beginner prior to that bracketed message
creations-chat 2023-04-13 20:58:56 that is true I guess but I do think people here are a bit too harsh
general 2023-04-13 21:04:56 god zamn
general 2023-04-13 21:04:58 he's got some cake
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:39:58 bro this shit is mad funny
