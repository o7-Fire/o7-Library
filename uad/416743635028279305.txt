creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:41:55 ok so i figured out how to make a sled using nothing but magnets and it can go really fast but i dont know how i can use it in other creations
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:42:44 ive tried putting wings but it got all quirky when i added control flaps
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:46:52 also the magnet sled has no speed cap as far as ive observed
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:47:10 this is as far as ive gotten so far
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:54:24 you see ivan, when put tank in water, you get ultimate submarine fleet
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:55:03 i once saw someone make a flying battleship
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:56:41 like it had propellors
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 22:59:32 is there some sort of ultimate hover block that will allow me to keep my craft at the same altitude even in the void?
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:00:55 im trying to see how fast my hovercraft can go but i fly into the void before i can see its max speed
creations-chat 2020-09-28 23:01:58 it looks cheesed to meet you
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:15:32 nah ive figured out a way to turn my vehicle into a gosh darn railgun
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:16:39 my only problem is that i have gone so fast i cant tell my maximum speed because i keep flying off
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:51:17 through the power of magnets i have attained this speed in vertical acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:51:55 whats the fastest youve gone intentionally
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:52:41 was it involving that glitch where you just kind of spazz out?
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 23:53:01 oh dang
general 2021-02-05 22:51:15 has anyone ever made a thing that can break the speed of light?
general 2021-02-05 22:54:42 but like in a vehicle
