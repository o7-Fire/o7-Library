plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:14:12 How do I make my smoke pipes shoot smoke upwards?
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:14:44 That's how I place them..
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:14:54 The smoke always goes behind my vehicle. :/
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:15:35 it noclips through my train
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:15:43 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 20:17:24 Ik how physics work.. Though there a settings that allow you to mess with the smoke and stuff (which I've tried messing with) and I want to make the smoke go upwards (through the pipe I made instead of through the train) :/
