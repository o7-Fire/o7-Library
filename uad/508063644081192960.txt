plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:52:27 i deleted my tyetures
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:52:36 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:52:36 because another game I played in was laggy asf
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:52:39 i deleted the texture
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:52:45 from the actual file
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:53:02 no it was because i lagged
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:53:06 in another game
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:53:07 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:53:08 no

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:16 lmfao
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:21 as i said..
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:26 a game i worked for
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:29 is very badly optimized
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:38 i get drops to 12 fps from 60
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:44 sometimes .2
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:57 whatever i resigned from that LESIM community anyway it sucked
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:55:31 why I haven't restored my textures yet is a question i cannot answer
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:55:37 is that a
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:55:41 UH-60
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:55:46 i dont know antytinig about helis
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:55:50 ok bye
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:56:32 lmao missiles and rockets on a rescue heli
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 05:07:55 do propellers work in water

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:14:21 yes
creations-chat 2020-12-20 17:16:01 any feedback on my creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:18:51 does anyone have feedback on my creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:18:55 anything I can improve or
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:19:52 should I make the fairing bigger
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:19:54 like this?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:22:57 lmao they always do that

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:27:18 shreaders
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:27:20 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:27:39 yes just dont post in creation otherwise your points will go down
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:29:41 question is why would you need a stabilizer
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:31:19 this is the first thing ive made after the tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:31:41 make sure to keep your helium at the center of gravity
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:31:56 it'll misalign if you put it somewhere else or dont check the box
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:32:03 especially for a plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:32:22 
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:32:29 i think the finished product will be 3000+ parts
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:33:16 oh and yes 3-4-3 seat config
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:34:56 the only thing thats a bit unrealistic abt my plane is the cockpit height
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:35:01 i made it a bit too high
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:35:16 
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:35:24 
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:35:28 no ladders
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:38:01 and the cockpit is very spacious
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:42:46 sapcious
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:42:47 spacious
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:42:50 not suspicious
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:43:10 
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:48:48 i believe there are storage areas here
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 00:50:48 wth is that door there
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:01:49 for the aeronautical ranks, is it allowed to use ballast blocks in your creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:01:58 because lets say the plane gets too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:02:30 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:02:32 thank
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:09:03 the only problem with my WIP a380 is the wing length
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:09:35 in reality the wingspan of 1 wing is like 4-5 times the width of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:09:42 plot limits allow me to only make it half
help 2021-04-19 16:01:19 damping is energy absorption. higher the dampness, the more stable and smooth it is
help 2021-04-19 16:01:44 if you want it to extend smoothly without kinks put up dampness to 100
help 2021-04-19 16:01:49 same goes for wheels
help 2021-04-19 16:02:27 add a counterforce
help 2021-04-19 16:02:35 tail rotor or another propeller spinning other way
help 2021-04-19 16:12:13 do you have any wings on it
help 2021-04-19 16:12:19 its very unaerodynamic
help 2021-04-19 16:12:24 use cylinders
help 2021-04-19 16:12:25 not wings
help 2021-04-19 16:12:33 also add hover thrusters and set them to max drag
help 2021-04-19 16:12:35 itll stabilize
help 2021-04-19 16:13:28 hover thruster on the side works for pitch control but
help 2021-04-19 16:13:36 this one doesnt work,
help 2021-04-19 16:13:40 neither does this
help 2021-04-19 16:13:47 why idk
help 2021-04-19 16:14:09 alright
help 2021-04-19 16:16:27 center ur CG
help 2021-04-19 16:16:37 did you add hover thrusters
help 2021-04-19 16:17:02 add them and if it doesnt work use the hover thrusters to trim pitch
help 2021-04-19 16:17:08 you just
help 2021-04-19 16:17:10 place them
help 2021-04-19 16:17:13 inside
help 2021-04-19 16:17:43 ok
help 2021-04-19 16:21:34 you can try to add space using motorlocks, if that doesnt work
help 2021-04-19 16:21:42 you need to align your rocket vertically to your CG
help 2021-04-19 16:21:48 or close to it
help 2021-04-19 16:22:09 you can add control surfaces as a last resort to control it
help 2021-04-19 16:22:33 just make sure it its farthest away from the CG if you're doing that
help 2021-04-19 16:22:38 or CL idk
help 2021-04-19 17:58:02 thats normal because of the way it spins
help 2021-04-19 17:58:07 you need a counterforce
help 2021-04-19 17:58:11 either by adding a tail rotor
help 2021-04-19 17:58:30 or a secondary counterclockwise or whatever opposite direction of the original rotor
help 2021-04-19 17:58:56 ur plane is broken
help 2021-04-19 17:59:50 ive never heard of it but your motors are misaligned
help 2021-04-19 17:59:57 its broken
help 2021-04-19 18:00:08 check for misaligned or motors that dont belong where they are
help 2021-04-19 18:00:27 ill draw brb
help 2021-04-19 18:00:51 im using a mouse so expect to look like bad lines
help 2021-04-19 18:03:04 
help 2021-04-19 18:03:22 i cant draw tail rotor from top down because its facing vertically
help 2021-04-19 18:03:52 this is why if you look at tail rotor failures in helicopters irl the heli start to spin
help 2021-04-19 18:04:21 another option is to make a counter rotating rotor on top of the main one
help 2021-04-19 18:04:47 it produces more lift but it almost virtually removes horizontal stability unless you have fins

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:39:32 yes it did
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:39:49 question are exposed motorlocks frowned upon in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:40:06 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:40:21 well aesthetically
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:40:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:41:41 thats just basic motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:44:40 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 14:44:59 is that how u spawn so u dont die when u takeoff
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 17:15:15 n

general 2021-09-04 02:48:39 among me
general 2021-09-04 02:49:09 you are so sussy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:52:18 ok I have a concept in PC but I have no idea if it will work
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:52:51 basically you motorlock blocks together right, and if you disconnect the blocks they just fall apart but i think you could hold them together with magnets by welding simultaneously
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:53:08 it’ll allow for smoother blocks if you know the correct math
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:54:26 no like what if you press the weld toggle at the same time you motorlock it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:55:02 as in
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:55:03 here
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:55:05 I’ll try drawing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:55:33 cabins
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:55:40 or any interior space
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:56:09 let’s say the bottom blocks are attached to a motorlock tower with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:56:19 If you enabled the motor locks it would end up like the blocks above
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:57:18 hm?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:57:19 wym
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:57:54 because, it allows for good detail because not all the available blocks fit a diagram well and it would allow for custom shapes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:58:32 ooh I totally forgot about that lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:59:50 yeah but unlike counterparts it doesn’t require a stationary motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:59:54 but that’s pretty much it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:59:56 just cleaner build
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:00:32 also there isn’t enough magnets anyway for bigger builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:01:00 no no I know they can be used well but like it’s just personal bias/preference
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:02:01 oh and I don’t use motorlock towers in general because I spawn regular blocks in and build it like a construction set
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:02:07 like welding
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:02:40 having too much void space in the middle is annoy when you’re making rockets just making things separated all together maximizes space

general 2021-09-17 00:11:19 yo
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 03:59:07 guys how do you get extra keybinds for plane crazy? I know foreign keybinds work for mobile but on windows 10, IME and other lang keyboards just show up as the actual key letter on roblox
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 03:59:54 so if you press “á” where “a” would be in the keyboard’s language, it will input “a” on roblox
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:00:03 I think it changes if you change your entire display language
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:00:08 but I haven’t tried that yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:00:40 I mean it shows up the characters for the language in the chat, but not the keybinds for PC
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:00:54 I just need a way to add more keybinds into PC
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:01:14 I need at least 90
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:01:26 the what
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:01:35 oh that
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:01:40 yeah that’s for setting the keybind?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:01:48 but I need more keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:02:08 I only have 80 useable keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:03:32 I’ll probably try autohotkey and see if that works

help 2021-10-02 03:58:53 It’s illegal to use 1x1s instead of 4x1s when possible for block requirements right?
help 2021-10-02 03:59:02 I saw a rule abt it somewhere and I don’t recall where it is
help 2021-10-02 04:00:05 ok
help 2021-10-02 04:00:17 I swear I saw a rule somewhere back then about it being illegal but it’s gone now

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:19:21 I never use it so yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:20:18 nahh I’m just saying it if pc ever adds orbit
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:20:34 since they don’t give a gravity constant or specific impulse of engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:21:02 I don’t even own kerbal lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:21:20 im just a
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:21:27 weird dude lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:21:50 I mean I play sfs mobile if that counts
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:22:57 yea ik
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:23:03 I just look at nasa websites
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:23:05 those things
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:23:10 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:24:09 I mean there have been people trying to make orbit
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:24:12 in roblox
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:24:24 I guess it works but they’ve only done it on a smaller scale
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:24:37 tbh doesn’t space sailors just
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:24:40 pre animate things
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:25:39 ic
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:27:01 I don’t think anyone on roblox has ever recreated Lagrange points
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:27:14 if pc adds those that would be sick lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:27:21 stationary halo orbits
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:27:54 Even stock KSP doesn’t have lg points without a mod
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:29:49 true true
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:29:53 well what abt the sun tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:30:12 I wouldn’t mind if it wasn’t an actual star
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:30:14 or body
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:30:19 earth itself would be fine
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:30:57 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:31:40 also do you think they’ll add an aerodynamic gradient in the atmosphere
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:31:42 because lile
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:31:43 like
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:31:52 rn there’s aerodynamic drag anywhere
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:32:03 so you can’t really stay at a constant speed without using propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:32:06 That is if you have wings
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:32:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:32:40 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:32:50 someone suggested adding logic blocks in game
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:33:00 ig you could make computers with those
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:33:09 but I don’t think it would be powerful enough to control a rock lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:33:17 rocket*
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:33:49 yea that was what I was thinking
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:34:04 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:34:17 wait in game how wide are blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:34:20 like 2 studs?
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:35:07 because like if we made creations 1:1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:35:12 I’d imagine one block is 1 foot
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:35:16 but not really sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:35:57 I’m pretty sure it was 3 lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:36:17 I heard roblox characters are supposed to be like below 5 foot realistically
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:36:53 bruh roblox studio says 2 studs = half a meter
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:37:29 true lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:38:15 huh it says a roblox character is 5.5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:38:27 weird
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:38:33 so a roblox character is apparently 5’1
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:38:50 since roblox officially puts 1 stud as .28 meters
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:39:07 I don’t think a block is 2 studs because the characters foot doesn’t line up perfectly
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:39:22 it’s something like 2.2
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:39:25 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:40:08 oh if that’s the case then
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:40:22 each block is supposed to be 2.75 studs
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:40:31 something like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:41:06 yeha that’s sounds more realistic
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:43:00 yeah nvm I scaled it wrong the first time
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:43:14 it’s like 1 stud = .918 of a foot
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:54:08 in pc2 when they say resize parts is it possible to resize below 1
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 00:54:18 or just whole numbers
general 2022-01-02 00:54:30 ok
general 2022-01-02 00:54:30 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:21:27 helikopter helikoptter
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:29:40 use windows store roblox xd
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 19:27:25 wtf lol materials don’t change block density but somehow a 1x4 beam is heavier than 4 1x1s
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:51:26 oh yoo if pc2 actually comes with a new physics engine then nice
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:51:32 current physics are broken af
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:53:33 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:53:49 idk if it’s roblox bc I’m talking abt the acceleration
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:54:01 like if u have a force - gravity ur speed should never stop unless 0 but it does here
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:54:04 so yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:56:32 no like yk how there’s a rocket and it provides upwards force right. if you subtract gravity’s acceleration from the vehicle’s acceleration as long as it’s above 0 it shouldn’t change but in game it does
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:56:41 like it tops out at a speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:56:55 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:57:06 idk why im even saying it yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:57:07 lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:57:13 I just wanna get technical with future builds
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:58:00 if pc2 doesnt meet my expectations idrc I’ll still find a way
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:58:12 I already spent like most of my robux on that game
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:58:16 I don’t have anything else to spend it on
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 04:58:23 lmao
general 2022-01-09 05:01:08 rip
general 2022-07-25 16:09:38 Throw up
general 2022-07-25 16:09:44 Yes it can
general 2022-07-25 16:10:05 any water can be lethal
general 2022-07-25 16:11:15 it don’t matter just search up LD50 water 💀💀
general 2022-07-25 16:12:59 Yeah exactly
general 2022-07-25 16:13:02 any amount of any water
general 2022-07-25 16:13:09 will kill you
general 2022-07-25 16:13:47 Are you asking if it’s lethal through mineral imbalance
general 2022-07-25 16:13:49 probably not
general 2022-07-25 16:13:56 Water can kill you in other ways
general 2022-07-25 16:15:48 how was I supposed to know 💀 all I said were literal facts though
general 2022-07-25 16:16:42 exactly
general 2022-07-25 16:16:46 thank you for agreeing
general 2022-07-25 16:17:28 Yes
general 2022-07-25 16:17:38 I said it prob can’t kill you through minerals
general 2022-07-25 16:18:51 i love eating apple seeds
general 2022-07-25 16:19:01 they’re bomb
general 2022-07-25 16:23:41 eat salt
