plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:40:51 Oh nice, I made quite a few star wars builds too but I've deleted quite a bit since they were very outdated
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:41:09 Bruh I didn't scroll down ðŸ˜©
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:45:47 Not really, just means you can't have a typical dogfight, or you have to adapt your tactics to what your aircraft is good with
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:57:40 Sounds like some red tails type of maneuver lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:08:03 The guns are so far apart oh god
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:09:22 I mean yeah but not on the wingtips ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:13:20 Yk I really wish there were control seats of some sort so that you could link certain controls and weapons to a seat and have a friend be a gunner or part of your crew. Not really a new idea but something I've thought about while working on my hover tank
