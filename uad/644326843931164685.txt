general 2023-05-20 07:57:48 its very bugged
general 2023-05-20 07:58:34 that jetpack gets stuck on for some reason even when you click off of it then it proceeds to go up even though your not making it go up
general 2023-05-20 07:58:57 I play ptfs sometimes just because its easier to log into
general 2023-05-20 07:59:09 Enjoy the 60gb updates

general 2023-05-20 07:59:28 besides the updates
general 2023-05-20 08:00:01 i have 1.5tb storage and 24gb ram yet it still dares to take up 500gb
general 2023-05-20 08:00:23 yea but sometimes i just want to screw around
general 2023-05-20 08:00:35 or to play on phone
general 2023-05-20 08:00:42 thats not payware
general 2023-05-20 08:00:56 menu is very confusing

general 2023-05-20 08:06:37 i feel like x plane 12 is the best
general 2023-05-20 08:07:59 graphics pretty decent but scenery suck but tbh scenery sucks on every sim below like 2020
general 2023-05-20 08:08:17 what gpu do you have?
general 2023-05-20 08:08:39 even xplane 11 scenery is bad
general 2023-05-20 08:11:14 u should get like a 1080 or something
general 2023-05-20 08:11:26 that can run decent graphics
