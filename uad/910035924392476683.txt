general 2023-04-22 20:58:52 has anyone else noticed how the game doesnt handle the lag motorlock causes anymore?
general 2023-04-22 20:59:23 like my when i spawn my builds it can barely load any angle locking or anchoring
general 2023-04-22 20:59:31 and your chat is hella delayed

general 2023-04-22 20:59:57 ong
general 2023-04-22 21:00:49 like bro my fa18 is heavily piston locked and angled locked, and a couple of weeks ago it had 0 problems loading in and angling, but after i came back from a break it has so much trouble doing anything

general 2023-04-22 21:08:44 blud a kid made a pc 2 rip off within a couple weeks
general 2023-04-22 21:09:23 ig
general 2023-04-22 21:09:52 im just mad about how pc1 cant even handle extreme motorlock anymore
general 2023-04-22 21:10:03 like it just delays everything you do by minutes
general 2023-04-22 21:10:09 ong
general 2023-04-22 21:10:19 real but its been like a month at most
general 2023-04-22 21:10:32 it was made by a kid so

plane-crazy 2023-05-27 06:15:39 Bro rick need to atleast update the first pcs code bc i can barely use any of my builds anymore
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 08:32:30 Like everytime i spawn it in everytime i try despawn its delayed by like 4 minutes, everytime i move a motor it teleports back, everytime i chat its delayed, everytime i try time i get a massive lag spike
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 08:32:51 He legit did it on December
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 08:33:44 Also theres a difference between being hardcoded and a simple update
