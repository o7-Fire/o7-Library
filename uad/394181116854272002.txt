plane-crazy 2019-11-28 03:03:34 when is this motor two glich gonna get fixed I was working almost completely with them ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 01:11:13 Any news on motor twos yeeting issue getting fixed?
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 01:11:54 Welp yea have to offput making my mech then...dangit
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 01:13:56 Make a plane put one peice of tnt on strap on a camera then leave the seat behind
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 01:15:16 Three hands, wait what <@228115104061849612>
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 01:16:31 Eh may not be able to make a cruise missle exactly but will still be a missle
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 05:57:10 Has anyone actually tested motor twos in depth to find the issue? The flinging one to be more specific
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 05:58:05 Really? Because last time i used motor twos it would fling my mech into the sky and that was like 8 hours ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 05:58:53 So unless it got fixed or im doing somthing wrong motor twos are still very broken
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:23:06 Aha see im not going crazy motor twos are still broken
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:24:01 Yea but at least at the beggining they did not fling you out of the world
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:30:19 icle
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:39:36 It hit the iceburg of gravity
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:40:25 Mhm
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:41:23 How can you really tell on roblox though half of the male characters look like winged rainbows hopping around
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:43:05 Only if you wear a pink fedora
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:43:27 I was hoping you would say you did
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:44:49 Let me guess your character is a edge lord with black wings and wearing some sort of black jacket or such.
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:46:21 Dang what chu look like then man
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:46:26 Hmm

plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:47:04 Good character though
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:47:25 I guess thats just robloxes default or somthing
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:49:00 Me on the other hand have done something nearly taboo in a population owned by dark colors i have made a character wearing all white clothes
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:49:22 How did "save" make it through that
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:50:08 Gosh dang it  <@287779983445721088> he used his imagination or a referance
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:50:15 Mostly imagination
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:51:33 Its hull is more deadly than its guns looks like it could chop a person in half
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:54:58 You know one thing thats bad about some of the plane crazy community, they dont freaken make thier own designs
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:55:20 Said "some"
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:55:47 Every server i see at least two people with a yuotube tutorial plane

plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:18:28 Stop linking the game!
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:18:41 Its pointless
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:19:19 Because you know having complete randos in a server can be destructive
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:19:31 And also prime for lag trolling
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:19:45 See why?
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 07:20:28 Oh geez only if there was no way for them to get another account and do the same thing XD

plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:13:04 Big oof
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:13:26 No binary
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:13:43 A failed binary code
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:14:12 I would know because my profile description is that  <@587406379451678722>
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:14:49 Its all an illusion

plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:15:30 Dont think there would be anything left
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:16:00 Sitting would be a pain the imaginary globe

plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:18:45 Okay anyway im probably gonna get off but one question to anyone thats willing to awnser it
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:19:17 Should i even talk or should i just say nothing so that i dont get mobbed by people who call me a liar?
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 08:20:01 Well that anwsers that question...
bug-reports 2019-12-02 06:16:54 Not a bug report sorry about typing here but a way to fix motor twos flinging issue if you have a multi jointed build is put mutiple anchor blocks then unachor them one at a time
bug-reports 2019-12-02 06:17:36 In each section of the build of course
bug-reports 2019-12-03 00:02:32 <@456226577798135808> put a anchor block in each section of the boat then slowly release each one, it wont complelty stop the fling effect but it probably will let you use your boat again
bug-reports 2019-12-03 00:30:20 Hm sorry i could not be of more help, its just what i did to stop my mech from flying away.
bug-reports 2019-12-07 08:44:53 This game is slowly destroying itself trying to fix itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 23:01:26 You just said yes to your own question
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 23:01:33 How does that make you feel
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 23:01:49 Oof
general 2020-08-25 16:57:03 Is it to late in the games development to implement resizable blocks?
general 2020-08-25 16:57:18 Dangit
general 2020-08-25 16:57:35 That would open up so much in terms of design
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 21:38:29 The one hit sword, you hit a tiny brick and it just shatters
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 21:49:07 they watch
creations-chat 2021-01-15 21:50:40 
creations-chat 2021-01-15 21:54:44 dang beat me to it
creations-chat 2021-01-15 21:57:18 then you must make it EVEN TALLER
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:03:22 i made a transforming wheel spider, due to it scraping across the ground when it walked and getting disfigured i tried to reset the motors  but somehow the motors can't find out where they started, so it just dances
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:05:24 Got to love motors huh?
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:07:45 i thought so to (might still be the case), but i just kept working with the motors and no matter what i did, the type of movement i use just breaks it and quickly turns it into a tornado of legs
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:09:47 anyway this is the wrong chat to talk about this
creations-chat 2021-02-01 00:43:07 i love it, but i bet it walks like soggy noodle
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:41:27 i saw other people do similar to show of their builds angles?
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:43:28 sorry though, just wanted to show off what i had
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:54:36 you can really make it as small or large as you want, but yea i would say so
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:57:10 btw im open to criticism on my build, so feel free to tell me whats wrong with it XD or what to add (just keep in mind it still a work in progress)
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:00:53 gonna sound like a broken record but any opinion on mine? or is it also just the color
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:04:36 dang, people dont take opinions very well, is just game why you mad
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:06:18 any thoughts on my warehouse/hanger build?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:08:30 <@!740641695783321670>  yea i do, its mostly flat right now but i can show you what i have

creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:21:14 and if you want a proper size reference (since i did not really put any good ones in any other photos), the first one with the small white lad in front is me, just for better scale
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:23:29 and yea <@!757887014388367401>  it looks great, i just feel like the sails should be a bit more rounded, apart from that everything looks perfect

creations-chat 2021-02-10 15:24:16 Indeed perhaps motor locking/more motor locking could do the trick

general 2021-10-29 20:54:09 skill issue
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:06:04 Someone else made a minigun with trails for the barrels so i decided to give it a go myself, how does it look?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:08:33 ah like in the middle?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:11:33 his design uses pistons facing outwards, mine go inwards, its exactly one block smaller (with the trails being the extra block)
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:13:37 actually maybe its almost exactly the same in height  and width thinking about it? his pistons are more compressed i forgot about that
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:34:14 sorry it took a while to change due to some voodo things going on with my camera's this better?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:36:31 i was about to say, i dont come here often but when i do everyone is just pretty much yelling at each other
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:38:42 okay ahem, now my turn to burn, i got 8 downvotes on my build what can i fix/change?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:40:58 ight, the center barrel is already there though (or whatever you call that....support)
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:44:13 i did not build it based off anything <@!698587744842022983> just a generic minigun
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:52:04 why hello
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:55:58 i know that much at least, and i was thinking about doing that but just decided to just wing it
creations-chat 2021-11-27 22:00:52 thats alright <@!705533053740777584> it does not exactly have to be accurate to a real life minigun
creations-chat 2021-11-27 22:03:56 alright, i don't know my guns so ill just do that.
