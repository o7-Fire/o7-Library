plane-crazy 2022-02-22 10:13:57 for walking things, use lots of motors and code some code (i'd recommend python's pyinput module) that moves the motors in a specific order and keep tweaking it until it looks somewhat natural
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 10:16:03 i dont know where I read it, but I remember someone talking about a new resize tool, so that you dont have 1x1,1x2,1x3 etc. but instead place a 1x1 and stretch it to a 1x3
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 10:16:27 or thrusters if you make the contact points ice
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 10:17:35 when my walker turns, it uses pistons that extend ice blocks from the feet to minimize friction so that I dont have to use like 70 super rocket engines
