creations-chat 2020-08-10 06:08:59 does anybody on the server have supreme master?
general 2020-08-10 06:11:29 I was looking through ranks, and I saw Master Supreme. I know tootiepootie has Expert Supreme, but does anybody legitimatly have Master Supreme
general 2020-08-10 06:11:59 I didn't think so
general 2020-08-10 06:12:06 but at that point
general 2020-08-10 06:12:24 that person would have to get probably their own item in the game lol
general 2020-08-10 06:12:40 for completing said achievement
general 2020-08-10 06:13:22 or a vip link run by admins so no interuptions
general 2020-08-10 06:13:39 a perosnal link I mean
general 2020-08-10 06:13:53 but with the plot space
general 2020-08-10 06:14:05 how would you load that on a public server
general 2020-08-10 06:15:38 224jay actually has 2 master ranks and wants to be a master supreme, but I genuinely don't know if it's possible
general 2020-08-10 06:17:00 like, you can make the builds, but the time, you might get the upvotes, but the people, you may even get it into HOF, but really...is this humane...to do that 7 times
general 2020-08-10 06:21:08 vip
general 2020-08-10 06:21:29 do you think that master supreme is possible for a human being
general 2020-08-10 06:21:47 > like, you can make the builds, but the time, you might get the upvotes, but the people, you may even get it into HOF, but really...is this humane...to do that 7 times
general 2020-08-10 06:22:39 the most somebody has I know of is 224 who only has 2 masters
general 2020-08-10 06:25:50 so does a build need at least 60 upvotes before it gets in HOF
general 2020-08-10 06:26:21 does that mean getting a anything in HOF automatically can get designer 5
general 2020-08-10 06:26:30 lol
general 2020-08-10 06:27:10 I got like 48 upvotes with a 3d balance thing

creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:05:25 well, you could put a 3x1 wing panel behind the chair, have the propeller connect to that on the back, and have inverted control surfaces infront of the panel

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:22:06 ima go for aeronautical or shipwright after I'm done with this vtol
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:22:31 I also made legacy glass useful for something
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:22:56 sure
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:23:20 gun is missing trigger and barrel and slide and rail etc
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:25:20 <@456226577798135808> that doesn't qualify for helicopter technician, it doesn't even use propeller blades and just uses tilted wings to make it elevate and hover, very basic move that doesn't qualify for any rank
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:25:58 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:26:12 mhm
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:26:27 then why do you need to have motors
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:26:34 that rotate the wings
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:26:47 
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:27:09 thats a wing panel
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:27:16 it is flat with the motor
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:27:42 dude
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:27:53 a wing panel is an even cut on the motor
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:28:07 propeller blade is slanted and is not an even cut
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:28:37 I hate when people use wing panels to simulate **rotors**
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:28:50 it's such a fake
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:29:16 exactly
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:29:21 their wing panels
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:29:29 not propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:29:51 propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:30:13 
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:30:57 make a 1 blade heli without tilting the blades
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:31:06 then you can call it a legit heli
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:31:22 wheres a picture
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:31:45 cause the one in creations tilts wing panels to make it lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:31:54 YES
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:31:58 THATS THE PROBLEM
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:32:29 you have motors tilting the blades
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:32:38 propeller blades are already angled
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:33:29 this is a legit heli
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:33:47 
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:34:22 the wing panels are there for aesthetics and make it harder to lift since their **not** tilted
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:34:52 because I worked hard to make a functioning heli
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:04 when people use motors to tilt wing panels
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:17 they dont make lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:25 make a plate of wings
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:30 and fly straight
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:33 you dont go up
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:57 exactly
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:36:04 it's counter-productive
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:36:28 theres more drag going up than there is lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:37:01 wOaH wInG pAnElS
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:37:24 can it fly without the tilting motors

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:40:26 WHY DO PEOPLE USE ROCKET ENGINES ON A ROTOR
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:41:12 do you see rockets on the rotors

creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:48:02 hey puri, I really liked that M2, how much time did it take to get all the motor locking done
the-dump 2020-08-23 05:51:35 if you don't know what I'm referencing,(or who,) I don't want to talk to you
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:54:46 seriously, I am good at motor locking, but I want to know the average time for making something look good, because sometimes I think I might be spending too long on one part of motor locking. So I ask a professional
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:56:01 exactly
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:56:15 thats what I was talking about
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:56:26 look at the upvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:57:18 though tbh, less than 50 blocks is a low effort build
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:57:50 yes, it is
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:58:04 via rules
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:58:39 now, I have a different server to moderate since somebody is acting out
creations-chat 2020-08-23 05:58:57 so I'ma go deal with that
creations-chat 2020-08-23 06:12:27 okay thanks, thought I was taking too long on making more...questionable builds

general 2020-08-23 07:32:50 Ok, kind of a weird thing to ask. But it's 2:30 for me, I can't feel anything, have no siblings, and heard knocking. Am I actually awake? Please, I dont know if I'm dreaming, going insane, or have bad hearing.
general 2020-08-23 07:33:47 I slept for 18 hours last night
general 2020-08-23 07:34:31 I will, but my anxiety and over creative imagination may not let me

the-dump 2020-11-29 03:49:49 I may or may not be going for master shipwright
the-dump 2020-11-29 03:50:25 that... is doable
the-dump 2020-12-03 03:12:22 I just became the 4,248,000th phantom forces favorite
the-dump 2020-12-03 03:13:49 
the-dump 2020-12-03 03:15:12 also, can I have tips on helicopters
the-dump 2020-12-03 03:16:37 I made one completely symmetrical, stacked rotors, top with double the bottoms, blades in the right direction, and spinning in opposite directions, along with a side of the center of mass right under the motor for the prop, and it decides to roll to the left
general 2020-12-03 04:24:12 can you use a jet for forward momentum on a heli for the role
general 2020-12-03 04:26:10 cobble is a great engine
general 2020-12-03 04:26:38 also your one to talk
general 2020-12-03 04:27:16 still better than anything you've made
general 2020-12-03 04:27:47 <@!287779983445721088>  you got pissed because I made a smaller plane than you
general 2020-12-03 04:28:19 then why did you block me after I made a 5 block plane
general 2020-12-03 04:28:37 no
general 2020-12-03 04:28:41 I dont block people
general 2020-12-03 04:28:48 I like to see the anger
general 2020-12-03 04:29:07 we are talking about on discord
general 2020-12-03 04:29:25 you thought I actually did it?
general 2020-12-03 04:29:39 sure
general 2020-12-03 04:30:38 have you ever once made something combining apocalyptic and futuristic
general 2020-12-03 04:31:27 a not quite dystopian but not new build
general 2020-12-03 04:31:39 why do you think it's named the "outlaw"
general 2020-12-03 04:32:09 really
general 2020-12-03 04:33:03 show me foil, sand, diamond plate, grass, slate, corroded metal, legacy glass(ew), metal, wood, and wooden planks
general 2020-12-03 04:33:17 show me where that is on my vtol
general 2020-12-03 04:33:29 I'm curious
general 2020-12-03 04:33:45 what part looks like sand foil or wood
general 2020-12-03 04:34:19 then get taste for beaten down futuristic
general 2020-12-03 04:34:41 yes it is
general 2020-12-03 04:35:02 it's called an engine
general 2020-12-03 04:35:09 get one sometime
general 2020-12-03 04:35:33 if you had to texture a block for an engine what would you choose
general 2020-12-03 04:35:52 thats sad
general 2020-12-03 04:35:58 lack of detail
general 2020-12-03 04:36:28 you don't fucking use rocket engines to make a jet ma'am
general 2020-12-03 04:36:53 lol
general 2020-12-03 04:36:59 so you admit to the crime
general 2020-12-03 04:37:31 thank you
general 2020-12-03 04:37:41 wait
general 2020-12-03 04:37:50 why am I arguing with pre expert disgust
general 2020-12-03 04:38:12 you have shipwright 4
general 2020-12-03 04:38:14 lol
general 2020-12-03 04:38:17 jokes on you
general 2020-12-03 04:38:47 so make a better than mediocre pvp build
general 2020-12-03 04:39:05 I don't do modern either
general 2020-12-03 04:39:16 I like the style, can't make it though
general 2020-12-03 04:40:14 thats poor design
general 2020-12-03 04:40:26 best part is barrel
general 2020-12-03 04:40:37 I'm not even joking I could build a tank better than that
general 2020-12-03 04:41:00 wow
general 2020-12-03 04:41:01 lag
general 2020-12-03 04:41:04 imaigne having lag
general 2020-12-03 04:41:13 lol
general 2020-12-03 04:41:30 I play max graphics accross the house from my router and no lag
general 2020-12-03 04:41:47 ha
general 2020-12-03 04:42:28 roblox runs perfect
general 2020-12-03 04:42:37 tf2 is the only laggy game I play
general 2020-12-03 04:42:50 and when I say laggy I mean like a small lag spike here and there
general 2020-12-03 04:43:05 2 deaths at most
general 2020-12-03 04:43:35 thats because fps drops are usually caused by lag
general 2020-12-03 04:43:55 ***usually***
general 2020-12-03 04:46:26 now
general 2020-12-03 04:46:33 back to my original question
general 2020-12-03 04:46:52 can you use jets as propulsion for a heli and still get the rank
general 2020-12-03 04:46:59 forward not up
general 2020-12-03 12:19:58 I want to say it looks like a train
general 2020-12-03 12:20:13 nut the front is rough
general 2020-12-03 12:21:12 I've never buily a functional heli before and I still haven't despite having 2 designs

creations-chat 2020-12-10 04:04:50 weakling, hes mediocre because he has a lot of level 4 ranks and im sure is fully capable of expert ranks but doesn't have the time or patience to make an expert to submit for the rank.
Also lets stop before we get warned

creations-chat 2020-12-12 04:11:50 I wish there was a neon material, I would gladly make it so, it's also funny because I had a lighter blue and people said no, so I trusted the people with expert designer rank
Should I add a second comms tower?

creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:34:09 Whys that, 7.5k blocks, discord influenced paintjob, what could change it
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:36:09 oh right, forgot people don't know what futuristic is, get out of modern already, its cool but its not the only genre
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:38:10 xD, almost half the boat is under water, there is a tower your blind, and have you even looked at the ships mediocre details.
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:40:11 n i c e, "people dont like it" alright. also are there even seperate rules other than don't talk in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:42:36 because I'm trying for at least expert
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:44:37 I'd like to see you make a 7.5k block build without inspiration
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:47:33 it does look nice
it was also hell to build the middle
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:52:55 you can get designer 2 at least
creations-chat 2020-12-12 16:59:22 go to <#384027830192832513> and do $new, then send a picture and or link to the build

creations-chat 2020-12-16 03:00:33 figured rather make a pixel art of him and everybody know who it is, or make a pixel art of something else and absolutely almost nobody know what it is
creations-chat 2020-12-16 03:02:33 <@!409676438682206218> why downvote? is it because you think its bad or because you just don't want it to have a perfect score?
bruh
creations-chat 2020-12-16 03:07:44 <@456226577798135808> why do you have designer 4 and expert at the same time?
o_o
creations-chat 2020-12-17 03:07:57 guys if I get 6 more upvotes on my pixel art it qualifies for expert designer XD;https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/788600418485272576

creations-chat 2020-12-17 04:06:02 you would need a score of 30 anyway, not 30 upvotes, score is upvotes minus downvotes, sp you would need 23 more upvotes for designer[ii]
creations-chat 2020-12-17 04:10:45 however something that needs only 2 upvotes for expert designer and actually looks good is something I'm begin brave to post because people might downvote it to spite me is this; https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/788600418485272576

help 2022-05-31 08:13:30 what?
help 2022-05-31 08:13:58 what are you being honest about
help 2022-05-31 08:14:49 is it pointless if it makes it easier to work with
general 2022-05-31 17:49:00 So sad
creations-chat 2022-05-31 21:42:54 alright, how do I paint this to get in HoF
current paint was a placeholder to stand out details and patterns
creations-chat 2022-05-31 21:44:59 I made it a 2 years ago, and I never revisited it
creations-chat 2022-05-31 21:48:50 okay but actually, getting in HoF was a joke, how do I paint it to not be bad
creations-chat 2022-05-31 21:54:27 I need paint suggestions
help 2022-05-31 21:58:54 how do you angle lock
creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:51:19 lets be honest, he watched the tutorial, and thought it would be fun to try making his own, and in doing so he subconsciously followed guidelines of the tut without directly following it
so he accidentally followed the tut
creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:53:20 I almost did, but realized it looked familiar
help 2022-05-31 22:56:12 alright so how can you motorlock a custom wedgeblock together, ie 2x2x1
creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:58:55 <@927438201503772682> don't feel discouraged, this is just how the community is, when you get the chance, change it, maybe post it here for questions on how to change it, or maybe just delete it. Not too big, it's okay to try making another plane, but I recommend looking on youtube to make sure there isn't a tutorial for it
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:01:21 he clearly didn't intend to copy it, and I told him he could delete it to avoid negative feedback
this community sometimes is very rude and likes to ignore giving feedback, many times it can discourage people from ever playing the game again
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:03:39 there are nice people here, but I personally have never seen more than 10 different people give useful feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:12:00 oh boy time to get harassed for encouraging people to keep playing the game
I seriously don't know why people are so attacking in this server. Maybe he did intend to copy it, I still told him he could delete it to avoid negative feedback. He could have copied it to try learning to be better at building, but if you don't tell people what they did wrong and how to fix it, they can't do anything. Many new players follow tutorials to try living up to the real good builders, and while yes, they are claiming other people's builds, all they want is to be is a good player/builder. You can accidentally copy something btw <@456226577798135808>, watching a video, and hour or two later building something similar your mind recognizes patterns. I never said he was experienced, and he never said he was a great builder, but that doesn't mean he didn't try. You can insult people who did a tutorial, but for some people tutorials are a way of learning, There are literally tutorials for teaching people how to motorlock, anglelock, make conveyer or magnet engines, etc, and building tutorials for new players to learn ideas or building tricks. But honestly, every time somebody posts something remotely similar to a tutorial the person possibly could have never seen is just annoying. So attack me, I really don't care, I have known this server since 2020 and it hasn't changed. Good luck on your future builds <@927438201503772682>. And the rest of you people attacking him need to chill out.
help 2022-05-31 23:12:21 we have a 1x1x1 wedgeblock
help 2022-05-31 23:12:37 I want to motor lock a wedgeblock thats 2 wide, long, and 1 tall
help 2022-05-31 23:13:38 thats 1x1x2
help 2022-05-31 23:13:45 not 1x2x2
help 2022-05-31 23:13:50 I need that but a block wider
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:16:24 did I? Not once did I say you should post other peoples builds, I said you should learn from them and not promote your ownership of them
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:18:30 I was already right in the first sentence
help 2022-05-31 23:19:52 does it exist and I can't find it or is it just not possible
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:20:39 is it alright to bully someone for something that they could have done accidentally

<@456226577798135808> his wasn't block for block, there were similarities, and you're going to argue he made the original and changed it to be 'smart', but seriously, why is this such a bug deal to you guys
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:22:42 before I left the server last year I had triple your expert ranks
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:25:05 I wasn't quoting you, I was using air-quotes. also why I didn't use double quotes

<@883063424614006878> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/707751556640145419
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:28:13 First of all, thank you for being reasonable I think I even remember talking with you, second I wish it didn't sound like that, but unfortunately that's how I'm being judged, I meant it in more of 'just give the guy a break' because this community isn't always the best at helping people
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:30:19 lol you found one of my most downvoted things as your comeback? pathetic <@456226577798135808>

<@456226577798135808> yeah im curious on how I got expert designer with it
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:32:37 pretty much, most my first iterations are bad, and it was meant to more show off the bomb than the plane

<@456226577798135808> don't act like you don't understand yourself...jokes I mean
help 2022-05-31 23:33:18 yeah I thought about trying that and I change my mind
help 2022-05-31 23:34:49 I mean the half sphere is a good way to go with it, but yeah it would be very difficult making a 1.5 cylinder
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:35:34 see what I mean, oh wait no you don't
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:39:50 well this has finally died down, thankfully. I'm tired of wasting my time with people who can't learn what positive feedback is
people ran out of arguments I saw worth my time. I mean this guy(<@456226577798135808>) is literally finding the most embarrassing excuses for insults since complimenting a darwin award was done so I think I'm going back to working on my boat
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:42:23 tell me about it, so far I have found 3 good people who aren't mods

<@550023862876635147> a little blocky, maybe change the material for the wings to metal
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:44:43 honestly one of my better missiles, see people forgot about the inverse triple reverse psychology flip where I wasn't sarcastic in saying it was made to be trash

<@873696499513561088> quadruple negative
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:49:38 Alright, so let me tackle these 1 by 1, the plane I spent half the time of the bomb on, the blimp I stopped doing because it was bad, and the tank was a challenge I did from bordom that somebody else gave me the idea for, all of which had less than 6 hours of work combined
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:51:59 I spent literally 45 minutes on that build, because I was having a race with a friend on building a bomber that worked. If you're only talking point is something that I could do substantially better in a single day and more than 90 minutes then you need some new material. Also notice that I said it was one of my first planes, I don't even have it saved anymore

I don't save things unless I actually spent a memorable amount of time on
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:54:28 also just saying look how shit my avatar was
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:57:18 nice selfie

<@456226577798135808> dude, you're only insult is something I personally made to be bad, I don't care how people represent me in this server, make me a meme, but don't discourage new players
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:59:20 so far the only things you have said apply to you in exception to images of which I have told you they were bad and why they were that way
help 2022-06-01 00:00:32 the mods have to do a lot so it might be an hour or two before you get it
help 2022-06-01 00:01:01 ah, in that case dm somebody
help 2022-06-01 00:01:12 if the ticket is still open
help 2022-06-01 00:01:23 if the ticket was closed then it was declined
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:02:05 should, but don't, never made anything like that before, my first vehicle was a functional vtol
also always paint
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:04:19 he's too thick to be a stratofortress, and not enough engines or wingspan, but good attempt
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:07:18 ?? you know there's a 2 minute slowmode right... regardless I genuinely have lost respect for you, I like giving everybody a chance, rarely 2, but honestly I have been right from the start, I am getting harassed for helping new players stay motivated.
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:11:25 If you seriously can't find it in you to respect people who stand up for those who get bullied, then you have failed as a human being in the firm of humanity, let's picture the scenario
a guy presumable follows a tutorial, and gets bullied (naturally)
I mention that as a new player he just wanted to have something good to not be called a noob for
I then get bullied for helping the guy and recommending him to delete and find inspiration elsewhere
and I continue getting bullied for..what exactly?
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:15:51 I would love, to, but I want to see how much <@456226577798135808> is willing to expose himself, because it is funny
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:17:53 for what exactly? Reposting a build I did 2 years ago in less than an hour?
creations-chat 2022-06-01 00:20:46 I try, but I have such a boring life I get carried away sometimes

creations-chat 2022-06-01 10:10:57 I need to find time to make a really nice heli, I know how, and I love helicopters, but I want to use all the tricks in the book to make it
creations-chat 2022-06-01 10:20:57 WAIT, I think I can do a triple vertical fold xd
creations-chat 2022-06-01 10:23:57 hey, at least this one will fly
creations-chat 2022-06-01 10:57:53 what do these look like
creations-chat 2022-06-01 11:00:06 can you think of anything in relation to a carrier or planes
 I thought of something to keep the planes stationary in case of a hard motion in the ship's movement
creations-chat 2022-06-01 11:02:22 yes but I need an excuse for hiding the motor fold

feedback?
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:31:33 let me rephrase, what would you change to make it better

<@793132196810588200> I meant it as in clean, no exposed motor lock
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:33:54 there is a single motor in that image and it's used to rotate the rear stabilizers

<@765318482753224704> then why don't you make a 100 block plane
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:36:27 I knew the nose was bad, didn't really try on it, I meant to have the rockets 1 lock lower but still figuring that out, and nozzle is eh I think
regardless thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:38:35 didn't notice until after, also was thinking this community cared about cleanness was a mistake I guess
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:41:27 actually no, I learned my lesson, <@466793357318815744> can you possibly help this to not become an issue
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:43:37 <@567763933952475157> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/981655790702166098

creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:45:45 I made a heli that barely functions let alone looks eh after a few days, how long did you guys spend

I got my roles
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:35:04 <@866227531032428554> despite the fact of no motor lock, it is extraordinarily hard to impress people without motor lock because they need such detail, and a lot of people, me included, don't see it possible to make a well voted heli without motor lock and often angle lock

<@733919777793507389> you need level 3 in the server to post images
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:37:36 yes, you really should have, I think white with a light gray top would be nice, but you need to experiment to find a good color combination

<@777505711109701633> the slate is an interesting choice for the material, base materials could almost be better. Color is decent however when the doors are open I guess it just looks a little messy
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:40:13 camo is tough to get right trust me
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:42:18 fair, but you can still search up images, plenty from clone wars especially should come up for plenty of reference
help 2022-06-04 17:45:08 I want somebody to help me in-game with advanced motor-lock, 
show me one of your things with a lot of motor and angle lock, then help me understand it enough to where I can roughly replicate a smaller scale,
So I can hopefully improve off that and make my own
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:45:28 lol excellent, think about scale. Also a good color could be around 175 175 175, the red maybe 135 10 10, I'm not good with green so maybe test around with it
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:48:50 try 190 190 190 instead, mess with it - silver is 192 192 192

bug-reports 2022-06-05 02:19:54 I'll let this speak for itself - no idea how I did it
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:34:47 I don't use this channel enough to know theres a pin
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:35:21 you would know
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:35:54 just as much as you
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:36:11 don't apologize about your own disability
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:36:30 what you replied is your answer
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:37:27 
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:38:11 don't need to know about your personal life
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:38:56 we'll see when I finish this
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:39:04 have to match your insults
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:39:42 your disabilities will only dampen my ability
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:39:57 take your own advice
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:40:21 maybe you need to read
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:40:55 
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:41:37 at least mine had the rightt colors
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:41:52 you're right, it's substantially worse
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:42:19 how do you manage to start an argument in any chat
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:43:27 then we have something in common
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:43:58 
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:44:26 "merely advertised the pins
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:44:42 you say after literally cursing me out
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:45:03 I said cursing not are cussing
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:45:19 at least get your corrections right
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:46:21 maybe learn the english language before you argue with those who have
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:48:10 "take your own advice"
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:48:18 remember that
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:48:34 
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:48:48 clearly you are if you can't figure out I'm not
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:49:34 the arguement ends with you
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:49:46 he who starts it ends it
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:50:14 or are you running out of 3rd grade insults
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:50:52 as if I watch anything for my insults
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:51:04 if what I have been using since 2019 is in a video deal with it
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:51:44 now go ahead and type out your passive aggressive response and continue the argument
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:52:38 if I had no skill I would have less ranks than you
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:52:55 and score
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:53:05 I do too
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:53:29 you missed my things with 70+
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:53:41 do I still have that saved?
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:53:44 no.
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:53:52 therefore I do too
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:54:46 and mine was meant to be literal trash
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:54:53 no I didn't
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:55:07 never once did I say it was good
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:55:23 because you're not saying it's bad you're saying im bad
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:55:41 what do I search for
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:56:02 I would agree if you had 1 better
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:56:07 no
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:56:15 
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:56:31 bro the starter plane is better
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:57:23 his role prob took more effort than your des V
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:58:10 I feel bad fort you then
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:58:29 because that green truck could be remade in 10 minutes
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:58:42 with more roles and skill I am
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:59:04 if you think I'm that dumb you're delusional
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:59:12 then resubmit
bug-reports 2022-06-05 03:59:38 really? because I'm not the one that continues defending pride online
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:00:54 you literally called me a dumbass in the form of "advising to read the pins"
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:01:50 you are too ;)
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:02:18 dang puri just went offline
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:03:00 what are the chances rbk is online
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:03:57 it's already gone
bug-reports 2022-06-05 04:08:14 yeah I solved it don't worry
creations-chat 2022-06-05 04:19:58 I got a better one for you
creations-chat 2022-06-05 04:22:13 I like your sarcasm
creations-chat 2022-06-05 04:26:06 well then you must not be very funny
creations-chat 2022-06-05 04:53:43 looks like a good start
creations-chat 2022-06-05 18:31:46 
creations-chat 2022-06-05 18:34:17 
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:19:45 actually though, rbk is the only mod I know that actually pays attention to this chat, maybe yousuf also looks at this or <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:22:59 I think that it makes more sense if people actually payed attention to what roles people had, and didn't expect something expert vtol worthy from a white name
sure some people get good votes on early builds, but a lot of people vote based on the best things they saw, and not the persons capability
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:25:24 not anymore also we share 3 roles lol
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:27:57 thats because there's all the top people who spend a lot of time on builds, and meantime there is a bunch of new people who put up what they made and think it's good because they don't compare themself to the top people
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:30:21 It is true I think we need to be more strict about builds in <#384025409945337856> but we also need to still be sort of kind to new players so they keep trying
<@660019099430289418> I thought about the idea of a channel for lower quality builds
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:32:58 The main problem with new players builds is they get upvoted more than they should sometimes
If they were downvoted to community opinion but offered feedback to their skill like offering to teach motor lock then that would be optimal
help 2022-06-05 20:35:54 alright
help 2022-06-05 20:36:01 so each motor locks half a block
help 2022-06-05 20:36:11 because of the way you have it there is a 4 block gap between them
help 2022-06-05 20:36:44 so it only drops 2 blocks
help 2022-06-05 20:36:53 thats where there is 2 blocks after
help 2022-06-05 20:38:05 try a staircase like
 .    .   m

help 2022-06-05 20:44:33 I think its more often taller than wider
help 2022-06-05 20:48:12 that belongs to designer
help 2022-06-05 20:48:26 I'll do ship and then architect

help 2022-06-05 21:06:28 don't worry niether do I
help 2022-06-05 21:08:28 this is where we bring in angle lock

help 2022-06-05 21:10:02 
help 2022-06-05 21:10:40 no
help 2022-06-05 21:10:51 it uses them to delay the lock
help 2022-06-05 21:11:01 detonate the tnt and it locks
help 2022-06-05 21:11:31 before you det you can use powered locked motors to rotate parts into place
help 2022-06-05 21:12:23 
help 2022-06-05 21:12:48 you can see motors that can rotate those pieces in order to get them in the right place before lock
help 2022-06-05 21:15:42 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
help 2022-06-05 21:16:08 powered lock motors can still rotate
help 2022-06-05 21:16:40 along any normal lock motors
help 2022-06-05 21:16:58 if they are connected they can't compress because it would break the weld of the tnt
help 2022-06-05 21:17:07 and it was going so well
help 2022-06-05 21:17:20 it works
help 2022-06-05 21:18:35 you have to be in pvp or private server

help 2022-06-05 21:20:49 yes, but you shouldn't
help 2022-06-05 22:19:24 maybe
help 2022-06-05 22:19:28 depends on what
help 2022-06-05 22:19:38 angle locking?
help 2022-06-05 22:20:01 you have to have the moving motor on lock
help 2022-06-05 22:20:19 "it won't rotate"
help 2022-06-05 22:20:31 show me unlocked
help 2022-06-05 22:21:15 you don't need the locking to the sides

help 2022-06-05 22:25:11 try it
help 2022-06-05 22:25:19 motor lock takes a lot of experimenting
help 2022-06-05 22:25:24 lol
help 2022-06-05 22:25:54 try moving the lock back a few blocks, and putting the main wedge there
help 2022-06-05 22:26:52 the front can be...

[ ] w [ ]
 w [ ] w
[ ] w [ ]
 (-lock)
help 2022-06-05 22:26:55 from the front
help 2022-06-05 22:27:10 the lock would bring down the angle lock to fill in the corners
help 2022-06-05 22:28:17 can you place the top wedge
help 2022-06-05 22:28:50 yes
help 2022-06-05 22:29:12 then you have the angle lock almost a replica of the nose above it and you can rotate 45 and lock
help 2022-06-05 22:29:42 no
help 2022-06-05 22:29:56 you will asdly have to use a normal motor
help 2022-06-05 22:29:58 yeah lol

help 2022-06-05 22:34:04 also maybe have the 2 angled wedges connected to a block and rotate that block
help 2022-06-05 22:35:21 yes but it makes it cleaner if you don't
help 2022-06-05 22:35:55 hold on let me get in the game and make an example
help 2022-06-05 22:37:05 you can always move the lock back
help 2022-06-05 22:37:17 remember you can use cameras and cylinders to connect
help 2022-06-05 22:39:03 I usually do mid plane
help 2022-06-05 22:39:12 or right behind cockpit
help 2022-06-05 22:41:12 yeah
help 2022-06-05 22:41:19 remember you can also have it go the other direction
help 2022-06-05 22:41:26 instead of angle back angle forward
help 2022-06-05 22:41:56 cylinders and/or cameras
help 2022-06-05 22:42:48 okay so here is a simple undetailed nose

help 2022-06-05 22:52:05 remember that anything you motor lock from the middle of the plane will be in the middle of the plane, I have that go up by 1 because the nose is a block tall
help 2022-06-05 22:55:43 is the motor on lock

creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:32:46 can both of you just stop arguing, speaking from experience all you do is waste every bodies time reading your pointless argument online
looking at you <@923332873409396747>
creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:35:06 alright I tried, hey <@602256843028299786> can I get some of that popcorn
creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:38:19 thanks man 🍿
creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:52:39 well "delete it" or anything related isn't positive feedback
creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:54:44 it got downvotes because this server has a lucrative amount of negativity and people expecting hof level stuff as normal submissions

also double mod ping lol

<@914605911744593930> it's ww2.1
creations-chat 2022-06-06 21:57:26 <@456226577798135808> dude, just stop, the more messages you send the deeper the hole you dig, shut up, and you will be fine, keep going and the chance of a warn grows exponentially

lol
creations-chat 2022-06-08 03:38:29 new rule, bot disallows downvotes on white names
imagine
creations-chat 2022-06-08 03:45:16 it was a joke dude jesus
not that it would even be a bad thing
creations-chat 2022-06-08 03:48:14 why are you so aggressive
what do you gain from failing to insult somebody online
creations-chat 2022-06-08 03:52:02 white name is a classification not an insult, it's like saying calling people in america americans, you aren't supposed to get offended because it's a group of people, because I have a role doesn't mean I have any more authority
just don't argue, it was a joke, never an insult in the first place
creations-chat 2022-06-08 03:55:01 seriously though, all they want is feedback, and I provide it when I can, I see no reason why he shouldn't let it go

<@706717603258957864> if I say americans love BBQ, would you get offended if you don't like BBQ? (assuming you're american for the sake of example)

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:38:22 brick maybe mixed in
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:38:35 it controls time
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:38:44 4th dimention is time
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:38:50 can it travel space
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:38:57 5d creature yooo
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:39:22 yet you failed to see it's 5th dimentional form
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:39:56 he said it travels time and space
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:40:41 what even is the 6th dimention
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:41:33 bro it's straight up beyond space
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:41:45 I just had an epiphany
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:42:38 the 2nd dimention is measured by the first in 2 ways, 3rd by the 2nd in 3 ways, we don't know how to measure time by the 3rd, but we measure the 5th by the 4th
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:42:44 meaning the 6th is measured by space
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:43:23 anything beyond 5 is literally outside of known reality
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:43:35 what did I uncover
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:43:56 I swear I need to stop thinking about this
general 2022-06-08 04:44:11 why
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:44:26 yo?
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:45:09 there is also a theroy that we are a simulation for a higher being
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:45:15 that can also be in a simulation or a higher being

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:55:11 im undercover as a white name
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:55:49 are blackholes a one way wormhole to white holes
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:56:11 classic comedy
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:56:58 a white hole is the oposite of a blackhole, it repels force at a limitless strength
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:57:44 there could be a supermassive white hole in the middle of the universe
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:57:53 it's possible thats where all black holes lead
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:58:55 thats why it is possible that the time blackholes bend is repaired upon contact with a whitehole
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:59:09 explaining why reality hasn't fractured time yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 04:59:45 because every action has an equal and opposite reaction

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 05:00:45 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 05:01:16 because if newtons laws apply to the 5th dimension that means that I'm right
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 05:01:30 and I'm pretty sure inertia exists in space

help 2022-06-12 01:54:33 .
help 2022-06-12 01:55:08 well there are a couple things you can do
help 2022-06-12 01:55:34 you can swap to having a single motor for all 4 wedges, or you can do the bottom the same you did the top
help 2022-06-12 01:55:51 I recomend the 1 motor
help 2022-06-12 01:56:16 unfortunately you cannot
help 2022-06-12 01:56:31 however I found that a speed of 0.4 is good for accurately making the angle
help 2022-06-12 01:57:09 maybe if they add lock to motor 2
help 2022-06-12 01:57:16 but thats a hope
help 2022-06-12 01:57:41 have the motor be locked into the same line as the nose
help 2022-06-12 01:57:57 then have a + shaped thing on the end with the wedges attached
help 2022-06-12 01:58:13 basically locking another nose into your current except the replica is angle locked
help 2022-06-12 01:58:30 kinda yeah
help 2022-06-12 01:59:03 yeah lol
help 2022-06-12 02:02:49 show an image

help 2022-06-12 02:04:32 thats fully locked
help 2022-06-12 02:04:37 the block you placed on top
help 2022-06-12 02:04:41 is on top
help 2022-06-12 02:05:00 the motors start in the middle of the fuselage
help 2022-06-12 02:05:11 when you put the blocks on top of the top motor
help 2022-06-12 02:05:27 it contracts them to 1 block above the fuselage
help 2022-06-12 02:05:35 if you move the arm down a block
help 2022-06-12 02:06:06 it should work
help 2022-06-12 02:06:31 the entire row
help 2022-06-12 02:06:46 yes
help 2022-06-12 02:07:34 it should contract 1 more half block
help 2022-06-12 02:08:04 try removing the disconnectors for testing
help 2022-06-12 02:08:09 just to make sure
help 2022-06-12 02:08:44 try putting them in a differnt way
help 2022-06-12 02:10:11 hm

help 2022-06-12 02:11:02 hold on
help 2022-06-12 02:11:43 add the disconnectors on the back in the same configuration of the motors
help 2022-06-12 02:12:02 but then just have disconnectors connecting them, and a wing in the gaps
help 2022-06-12 02:12:06 lemme make an example

the-dump 2022-06-14 05:00:11 Fake images
the-dump 2022-06-14 05:00:22 That never happens
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 01:59:54 do you have inspiration or is it just something you're making
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:00:57 well the intakes on top is an interesting addon
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:01:17 the nose looks great
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:02:32 heh, see my solution to that is being a person that works on vtols and boats
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:02:50 one of my first vtols had awesome jets however had a tube as a body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:03:05 a vtol is like a helicopter but also a jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:03:27 if you know what an osprey is thats a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:03:48 the rotors allow it to go up like a heli and then rotate forward to go fast and move like a plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:05:54 anyway you are working your way from front to back so I say try to make a sketch or idea print and then try to recreate it as close as you can to allow a natural look and 'rough'ish look
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:05:56 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:06:07 you could just motor lock it into place
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:06:49 the hardest thing to get used to in motor lock is to get familiar with how its going to look instead of how it looks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:08:44 they move into place right
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:09:02 make something else move into place with the wings attached
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:11:05 I think thats a plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:11:20 first glance thought it was a boat
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:12:22 so the part of the cone
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:12:27 that stays straight
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:12:47 yo you followed a tutorial <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:13:28 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:13:38 that could work
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:13:39 try it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:14:24 you heard him
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:14:33 without the ***i f l t e r***
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:15:34 it flters your coffee straight out your pocket
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:16:41 hm, try half a block higher
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:16:58 remember motor locks go by a half block
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:17:25 the full chain goes by 1 ontop the other for a full block
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:17:39 if you cut a part the chain in half it will go up a half block
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:17:55 but so will everything else above it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:21:23 that top mid image ain't right
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:21:50 dont know man
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:22:17 taking a short break from the game so I'm not gonna hop on to test around
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:22:40 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:24:01 test around
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:24:11 hm?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:24:29 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:24:34 true
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:27:34 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:27:47 try to cover the gap
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:32:18 check the motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:32:39 wait why cant you just ahve the wings attached to the main body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:32:47 not the angled one the main one
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:33:11 you clearly have the angled body right
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:33:13 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:33:20 have a bar go out from behind the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:33:26 to attach the wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:33:48 it would work no?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:34:07 okay
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:34:29 how does the motor lock and angle lock attach to the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:34:39 with a few blocks right
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:35:04 okay
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:35:12 have a few more go behind the bottom of the lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:35:20 and attach the wings to those blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:35:34 it will be covered by the angle locked body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:36:10 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:36:37 I know right?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:36:47 honestly more toxic than the r6 community
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:37:16 flies great!
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:37:32 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495286269459300364/983963029513306112/unknown.gif
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:38:32 yo I want to know how to build a
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:38:55 the angled body locks over the main body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:39:08 the main body is where the motor locks are attached to the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:39:30 exposed motor lock<:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:39:39 wdym?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:40:20 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:40:24 are you?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:40:40 control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:41:00 allergic
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:41:03 why
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:41:42 well you can have motors to turn the wings but good lock having them seamless
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:42:39 I am also known for locking control surfaces into the wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:42:57 have you tried opening it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:43:13 problem solved
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:43:28 if you are on xbox
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:43:43 then I understand, however you can't use discord on xbox
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:44:01 so you can play it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:44:17 for what purpose
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:44:30 were you banned
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:44:47 so why can't you play it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:45:08 how are you using discord
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:45:20 so play on your phone
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:45:42 then you also get a passive +20% respect bonus
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:49:40 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:49:47 2 motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:50:19 start by making the front
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:53:07 okay
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:53:17 have a motor on the same layer as your wing
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:53:21 and a motor on top
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:53:54 then you can have the wings next to eachother vertically
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:55:37 that means the top wing is connected somehow
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:56:26 amazing
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 02:56:36 I go watch youtube now
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 08:19:00 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 08:40:19 longth
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 08:41:24 L
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:25:30 a
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:37:38 add a ballast on the opposite end
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:37:42 even the weight
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:39:41 did you adjust the weight of the tanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:40:04 I highly doubt your plane nose is heavier than 120 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:40:10 use config tool on the tanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:40:45 wait are you using blocks or tanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:40:56 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:41:04 those are for submarines
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:41:22 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:41:59 you prob only need 1
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:42:20 whatever you set the value to is how many blocks that ballast weighs
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:43:26 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:43:36 hope you have good lift
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:44:10 can it get off the ground
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:45:10 amazing
