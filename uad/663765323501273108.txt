general 2021-09-01 12:20:34 What is the suggestion command?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:21:16 What is the command for suggesting? I have an idea :D
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:21:41 a
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:21:55 can you explain more?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:25:16 ok so I have no idea how to suggest so I'll drop it here as rickje is online

My idea is to be able to press q (or something else) on a block while the build tool is on your hand and that will get the block in your hand so you can build way faster
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:25:25 Oh, thanks bot
