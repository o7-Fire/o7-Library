The Tale of helltekky (901929515457056778)
general 2023-04-25 13:57:16 I'm building an F-22 Raptor, but there are propellers in the front that control the pitch. Is there a way I can make the propellers mouse controlled instead of W and S controlled?
general 2023-04-25 13:58:21 i think that the issue might be because the nose is too heavy, so I'm unable to control the pitch
general 2023-04-25 13:58:32 here's the model I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sv-swjI45s
general 2023-04-25 13:59:00 I play on mobile, so I don't want to use too many keybinds

general 2023-04-26 22:18:29 I've built an F-22, and I want to add a hover engine. I know how, but for some reason, I put it in between the rows of rockets, and my jet still isn't going past its intended speed. (634)

Here's a pic.
