The Tale of reiiigninblood (427233219146940417)
bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:39:28 Hey, theres been a bug for about 2 days now where players will glitch and continuously jump while on a moving craft and be sent skyward, I think its a collision issue? lemme know whats going on (:
bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:58:55 uh
bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:59:21 common sense~ when you turn the wheel round its pointing the other way, so therefore you have to reverse its controls
bug-reports 2019-02-10 01:03:25 Whus that meant to mean?
bug-reports 2019-02-10 01:04:27 Fine jeez, it was a joke thing for another server XD
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:46:39 Hehh
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:50:31 Hmm.
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:53:05 Does anyone know how I can stop people glitching on my  Land cruiser thingy.

On the lift shuttle when people stand inside, the doors close and it begins to lift people start jumping not of their own will, and then when they reach the top, when the walkways lower they kinda break cuz of the movement
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:53:24 How are you all?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:53:34 How so?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:53:54 Invisible fold? fill the details in please?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:54:08 For a boat, I see
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:54:17 But the folds for what purpose?
bug-reports 2019-02-10 12:56:40 Is anyone else having the trouble of other crafts trying to get on your craft, or just another player they continuously jump and glitch?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:59:10 Hes a bull.
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:59:19 Invisible fold.. hmm..
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 12:59:43 Have you thought about glass, on a motor, just painted white, and setting said glass to non colliding.
bug-reports 2019-02-10 13:00:06 No no, ive had that problem too. it affect sthe landing walkways.
bug-reports 2019-02-10 13:00:24 I jump outdespite touching nothing, and they automatically lower, meaning the lfit cant go up.

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:35 its more a matter of "am i skilled"

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:07:25 Hello!
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:07:27 Right
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:07:38 Ive made a damn APT
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:07:50 If any of you know what one of those are i will give you one candy
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:08:05 Yeet
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:08:07 i made one
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:08:20 It tilts and everything. British rail liveried
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:08:44 Unfortunately, i tried to make automatic tilts but i was stumped
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:08:59 How tf, tell me, would i have made the tilt automatic?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:09:08 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:09:15 Thats what i used smh
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:09:28 Funilly enough im gay
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:10:00 Nah, the main body would rest too high and the centrifual force the tilts meant to counter would make it unstable
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:10:19 Yeah, im sure it can too.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:10:33 Lemme take a few screenshots of it, ill put them here and in creations brb
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:12:16 only now do i see how an eyesore it is xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:12:29 i tried to recreate it faithfully.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:13:28 
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:15:32 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:15:35 its massive chonk
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:22:30 Long story kiddo
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:22:39 Theres winds and alot more than just hydrogen
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:22:43 some of those dont burn
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:22:46 So technically, no.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:22:55 Thats it
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:27:16 Ive created an APT. The APT (Aka Advanced Passenger Train) Was designed in the early 1970's, and realeased by british rail in 1976, however after just 1 week it was so plagued by technical problems it was withdrawn from service until 1979 where it was re launched, however, the severe lean made passengers nausious so it was quietly withdrawn 2 weeks after it went into service and were promptly scrapped, after millions in funding. The train actively tilts into corners, allowing it to go much faster than a regular train round corners.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:28:28 Due to lack of space on the plot i made it double ended, with no power car, just motors at the wheels. My design has a maximum speed of 249 using motors alone, However around corners its maximum speed is 140-160
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:14 It has a dining car, and luxurious seating, with ambient lighting throughout the train.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:32 passegner POV
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:56 At night, the warm lighting truly brings it together
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:30:20 Heres it tilting into the corner.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:30:46 
creations-chat 2019-08-11 20:54:40 oh mah gawd 7 upvotes for my APT?

creations-chat 2019-08-21 22:58:08 This is my behemoth moving city, it works on land and in water. its HEAVILY WIP, i thought id show you guys the skeleton so far. It has a large central Unpowered wheel, and a rear powered smaller wheel (ill post in a picture below) It also has the 3rd wheel, see it inside the big main wheel? That rotates like a ferris wheel, connecting the poorer district to the richer district tiers (not complete). Im not asking for any ranks YET, just can you guys Dm me with some feedback? Thankyou.

creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:50:00 Well
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:50:19 Looks alright
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:50:26 /but how practical is it?
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:50:48 Can it traverse the terrain?
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:50:56 Or is it limited to just flat tarmac.
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:51:06 I know
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:51:18 But when it does, are you making customised wheels?
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:51:46 I reccomend you use mechanical steering. The conventional wheels arent great for grip
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:51:52 Good idea.
creations-chat 2019-10-04 10:52:01 Tank?

creations-chat 2019-10-20 13:32:10 This is Le magnifique. Its a moving city/town with 6 houses, 4 decks, and several functions. It has 8 turrets, liftable Skegs (Ski legs) a large central wheel, with the smaller rear drive wheel. It has several moving mechanisms,such as some steampunk style push-pull piston mechanisms, aswell as having a fully working automatic elevator (vertical) with 2 ferris wheel like travelators providing transport between decks. it has a fully off road capable minature town bolted to teir 4, with 2 stories and 4 accomodations, lest things go wrong. it has an Advanced warning system using horns and red lights, telling people to duck or run.It can go basically anywhere on the map, albeit slowly. Build time: uhh i reckon around 3 months periodically on and off. 4900 blocks in total.
