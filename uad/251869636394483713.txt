plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:12:45 it would be really awesome to have like a radio block (with a small range to not annoy everyone) and a mute radio button

general 2019-09-15 00:53:30 <@299289130964090881> its on a wifi-like band
general 2019-09-15 00:53:45 and no military bases for hundreds of miles from me

general 2019-09-15 00:55:52 i would copy/ paste but it wont let me
general 2019-09-15 00:57:56 it is some sort of transmission though.. and it had data going.. that was one of the many encrypted packets sent.. each containing up to 6 characters
general 2019-09-15 00:58:18 what is even more weird is airplane mode was on
general 2019-09-15 00:59:44 its coming from a virtual adapter that takes raw radio from my wifi adapter
general 2019-09-15 01:00:18 at least i think thats what it does
general 2019-09-15 01:01:10 wifi push thing out of the question
general 2019-09-15 01:04:15 ummmm bye? i guess i might only have a few seconds

plane-crazy 2019-09-15 01:11:56 yes motor 2 is epic
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 01:13:24 i think it would be cool to have a system to allow a player access to pilot seats so we could have other players control guns

general 2019-09-15 01:37:08 btw did u get an EXE file
general 2019-09-15 01:37:17 no... thats a camera module
general 2019-09-15 01:37:25 just double click it

general 2019-09-15 01:37:54 can u give me a screenshot
general 2019-09-15 01:38:16 are u here?
general 2019-09-15 01:38:19 yeah

general 2019-09-15 01:38:24 good
general 2019-09-15 01:38:45 
general 2019-09-15 01:39:01 pCAP software
general 2019-09-15 01:39:08 packet capture
general 2019-09-15 01:39:12 it has lots of uses
general 2019-09-15 01:39:19 for good.. and for.. VERY.. evil
general 2019-09-15 01:39:43 pretty much if someone logs into an account over the same network their information will be logged on wireshark for you to use
general 2019-09-15 01:40:00 what OS do you have
general 2019-09-15 01:40:10 no
general 2019-09-15 01:40:14 im on windows 10 too
general 2019-09-15 01:40:19 so u downloaded the file
general 2019-09-15 01:40:25 go do your downloads folder
general 2019-09-15 01:40:38 and double click wiresharkinstaller something.exe
general 2019-09-15 01:41:00 yeah this one
general 2019-09-15 01:41:08 i have the latest patch
general 2019-09-15 01:41:18 it might say 32 for u too
general 2019-09-15 01:41:44 lol mine is out of date then ok double click it
general 2019-09-15 01:42:05 . . .
general 2019-09-15 01:42:12 ok go to ur start menu and type wireshark
general 2019-09-15 01:42:40 lol sorry i thought u meant you downloaded the installer and had trouble opening it
general 2019-09-15 01:43:43 so select whatever adapter u wanna start logging and well... watch for passwords or any other data you might need
general 2019-09-15 01:45:36 well its more of listening than action
general 2019-09-15 01:46:04 click a packet to see its info
general 2019-09-15 01:46:47 also if u wanna filter out passwords being sent over ur network http.request.method=="POST" use this in the top bar
general 2019-09-15 01:47:10 can u screenshot it just prntscrn and then ctrl v
general 2019-09-15 01:48:16 thats perfect
general 2019-09-15 01:48:24 there is no one logging into anything tho
general 2019-09-15 01:49:07 i havent tested it yet it may not work
general 2019-09-15 01:49:10 if that filter doesnt work
general 2019-09-15 01:49:33 delete all the text and try to manually find a name of a packet that appears relating to the service you logged into
general 2019-09-15 01:52:02 name of the site u logged into, your local ip address (like 192.xxx.xxx), device name
general 2019-09-15 01:52:43 u know.. its probably easier to just look up a tutorial i myself am a begginer at it lol
general 2019-09-15 01:57:33 sorry i gotta go
general 2019-09-15 07:09:01 well... tonight can get worse but hopefully wont.... 1. my only camera goes offline 2. i hear footsteps in the storage area next to my bed accessible through a hatch by the stairs.. and 3. i pick up a weird packet off my network
general 2019-09-15 07:12:03 nah
general 2019-09-15 07:12:31 tripwire hasnt gone off i had it originally because of my brother and the lock on my door being messed up
general 2019-09-15 07:12:54 after the events of ELOG-03 yeah.. its gonna stay there
general 2019-09-15 07:18:14 blue = camera (offline now) yellow = entry/exit point from storage areas
general 2019-09-15 07:20:50 its horrible quality.. the receiver had a weird function where it refused to take a screenshot because of low battery so i pressed the hotkey and aimed my laptop at it.. i caught it just in time.. this was taken facing the jumper drone into the storage compartment  entry right next to both room doors the jumper cut connection and the battery was found next to it in the morning
general 2019-09-15 07:25:16 this was a few nights ago.. lol i stayed up all night
general 2019-09-15 07:25:45 then this happened same night i really still like to think it was my jumper drone but im still unsure
general 2019-09-15 07:26:45 im not paranoid.. i just dont like hearing footsteps behind a single layer of sheetrock next to my bed
general 2019-09-15 07:26:52 they were real.. i felt the wall vibrating too
general 2019-09-15 07:28:06 ... out of the question i am NOT going back there
general 2019-09-15 07:29:00 first off its hot in there as can be seen in ELOG-07 when i put the temperature sensor in the entry
general 2019-09-15 07:29:21 79f
general 2019-09-15 07:29:39 ... why would i use celcius???
general 2019-09-15 07:29:48 no its 79 farhenhigt
general 2019-09-15 07:29:55 lol
general 2019-09-15 07:30:28 <@!307890271750979586> its a wireless thermometer and the camera is a modifed android smartwatch with an extended battery
general 2019-09-15 07:30:30 no actually
general 2019-09-15 07:30:53 uploading elog 1
general 2019-09-15 07:31:00 please wait..
general 2019-09-15 07:31:04 ELOG-01
general 2019-09-15 07:32:05 not really.. its just kinda straight facts.. what am i exagerating
general 2019-09-15 07:32:40 i do have a light.. the thing is litterally nothing else will work if its turned on
general 2019-09-15 07:33:01 im assuming u want proof of that too here one sec
general 2019-09-15 07:33:04 ill turn it on
general 2019-09-15 07:33:37 
general 2019-09-15 07:34:05 all sensors and stuff are made by me and they were made because of my stupid brother breaking into my room
general 2019-09-15 07:34:25 but they just happened to catch some weird stuff
general 2019-09-15 07:34:31 idk
general 2019-09-15 07:34:44 he is a jerk i finally got a real lock on my door now tho
general 2019-09-15 07:34:52 lol the last one could be unlocked with any flat object
general 2019-09-15 07:35:34 yes.. that is pretty terrifying
general 2019-09-15 07:36:15 yes..
general 2019-09-15 07:37:02 lol i cant really even have any clock that doesnt use internet set time because of how unreliable the electricity is i have 1 backup power bank and a smartwatch if this goes out
general 2019-09-15 07:37:21 i guess its 2:37 am
general 2019-09-15 07:40:18 this is litterally the most important thing in this room rn.. it handles my jumper drone's network, camera feed, and the network im currently using is being hosted on it
general 2019-09-15 07:40:42 structure tower
general 2019-09-15 07:41:03 me?
general 2019-09-15 07:42:11 i have 3 drone batteries 550x2 and 660x1 and then the 940mah battery that powers my smartwatch and its live video stream
general 2019-09-15 07:43:09 speaking of battery the camera module is about to go out again.. byeee
general 2019-09-15 07:43:59 .. not sure thats.. ready

general 2019-09-15 07:46:35 have u seen the video?
general 2019-09-15 07:47:03 well anyway
general 2019-09-15 07:47:11 so my camera got knocked out
general 2019-09-15 07:47:31 first off footsteps in the storage compartment to my right
general 2019-09-15 07:47:44 seperating by a wall of sheetrock and some studs
general 2019-09-15 07:47:50 yeah
general 2019-09-15 07:47:50 litterally like an inch
general 2019-09-15 07:48:00 then my camera feed goes out
general 2019-09-15 07:48:04 and here we are now..
general 2019-09-15 07:48:22 here this might help
general 2019-09-15 07:48:36 that door is next to where the camera went out
general 2019-09-15 07:48:52 the blue arrow is the camera and its FOV
general 2019-09-15 07:48:59 no idea..
general 2019-09-15 07:50:42 this weird looking thing
general 2019-09-15 07:51:27 lol its nice having stuff that is red because of how easy it is to find it and recover it if the battery drops suddenly like ELOG-08
general 2019-09-15 07:51:54 yeah i know
general 2019-09-15 07:52:10 i hate apple
general 2019-09-15 07:52:14 that was facing toward my door
general 2019-09-15 07:52:39 im pretty sure
general 2019-09-15 07:52:57 because i was not controlling it -_-
general 2019-09-15 07:53:12 its battery was in
general 2019-09-15 07:53:26 yeah something over... wifi
general 2019-09-15 07:53:42 thats it
general 2019-09-15 07:53:47 wifi
general 2019-09-15 07:53:51 PCAP time
general 2019-09-15 07:54:34 well nothing unusal here
general 2019-09-15 07:54:51 no the drone creates its own network
general 2019-09-15 07:55:05 which can be "overlapped" by a stronger network by its same SSID
general 2019-09-15 07:55:46 over the last few nights
general 2019-09-15 07:56:03 well not really all of it at night technically lol
general 2019-09-15 07:56:40 radio signal coming in and footsteps.. thats it
general 2019-09-15 07:56:55 i recorded the radio signal u want me to post it
general 2019-09-15 07:57:02 yep
general 2019-09-15 07:57:39 a very old house 1930 something idk in the country next to a beef farm in wisconsin
general 2019-09-15 07:57:43 nearest city is 7 miles away
general 2019-09-15 07:57:44 
general 2019-09-15 07:58:15 transceivers have a 16 mile range but it is unlikley any interference due to them being on a lower frequency band
general 2019-09-15 07:58:23 FRB radio
general 2019-09-15 07:58:25 handheld
general 2019-09-15 07:58:52 its like the type that people use for scanning police radio but on a lower frequency
general 2019-09-15 07:59:09 400 something to 430 something
general 2019-09-15 07:59:20 no not FM/AM/CB
general 2019-09-15 07:59:59 oooh what do we have here
general 2019-09-15 08:00:16 -_-
general 2019-09-16 03:01:21 oh poop its happening again and we are about to get nae nae'd
general 2019-09-16 03:02:56 i got mega oofed
general 2019-09-16 03:05:06 ... get a tracker and run around the map until u pick up a signal then
general 2019-09-16 03:06:08 or no  no go to the tower thats the best place to get killed in the game
general 2019-09-16 03:08:09 i hate doing this at night especially if the tracker gives below 120 while im getting here (if it didnt go out and its about to)
general 2019-09-16 03:10:34 hecc the game glitched and it stopped me from moving
general 2019-09-16 03:18:57 lol
general 2019-09-16 03:33:12 epic
general 2019-09-16 03:40:30 type this ID in i dare u
general 2019-09-16 04:25:42 i need to be decontaimanated after playing K A T
general 2019-09-16 04:25:52 they were toxic
general 2019-09-16 04:45:55 5 days till area 51 raid
general 2019-09-16 05:29:38 im bored. ima build a vehicle that can only be driven using radar in scrap mechanic lol.. kinda useless unless its RC
general 2019-09-16 05:29:54 i dont have any idea how to do it either.. should be interesting
general 2019-09-16 05:30:48 . . .
general 2019-09-16 05:30:54 lol
general 2019-09-16 05:31:04 the thing is there is no radar part in scrap mechanic
general 2019-09-16 05:31:08 i have to make one with sensors
general 2019-09-16 05:31:26 i .. accidently did a a plane that is scared of heights
general 2019-09-16 05:31:38 altitude sensor was painted the wrong color
general 2019-09-16 05:31:48 making it output negative numbers
general 2019-09-16 05:32:03 and slaming the aircraft into the ground if it goes 10 blocks above the surface
general 2019-09-16 05:32:57 that would be a creeper but with wheels
general 2019-09-16 05:34:22 lol i gotta make this place look better eventually
general 2019-09-16 05:37:11 with how fat this dude is its hard to beleive anything i make can actually lift off the ground
general 2019-09-16 05:52:11 its umm working?
general 2019-09-16 05:54:38 this is not a correct data stream something is causing huge interference somewhere
general 2019-09-16 05:54:50 
general 2019-09-16 06:00:46 i found the source but also my plane stopped responding and 1 wing folded up causing an imbalance in aerodynamics sending the plane sprialing toward the ground and destroying itself luckily i didnt crash too far from the signal
general 2019-09-16 06:10:09 idk
general 2019-09-16 06:12:13 . . . wtf what is this??? one of my research planes went insane when i messed up the frequency of a router connected to the entire system of them and it dissapeared from radar and now i find this... a minecraft block
general 2019-09-16 06:20:11 i didnt mod minecraft
general 2019-09-16 06:20:16 its scrap mechanic
general 2019-09-16 06:20:29 yeah ik
general 2019-09-16 06:20:50 some people dont know about the game scrap mechanic tho
general 2019-09-16 06:20:55 wth
general 2019-09-16 06:21:46 random beeping on channel 0 is coming through the receiver at my base its really eerie because of how silent things usually are
general 2019-09-16 06:22:06 i dont think it was really ever popular in the first place
general 2019-09-16 06:23:21 oof its going too fast for me to screenshot it but it goes -5, -14, and then 158
general 2019-09-16 06:24:53 and it appears to be coming from right outside the door ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:28:33 u guys wanna see a crzy plane..
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:31:25 sorry pressed the wrong button there it is.. its huge  way off in the distance
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:31:59 look closer
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:33:44 k here it is
general 2019-09-16 06:56:12 lol something is on the roof now and i put a hand on the dish
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:59:47 REE WHAT IS THAT THINGGGG
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:00:44 it blast through the wall
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:01:00 and it has a tracker on it so my radar dish "pointed" it out
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:01:31 
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:02:29 minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:03:33 actually yeah scrap mechanic does have alot of similar features
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:03:35 minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:03:46 i guess. if u install the wings mod
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:03:47 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:05:13 not really that seems to be the only option u could maybe compact it by just cutting off a few blocks from each of the arm things
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 07:09:16 what do u mean by 6 axis
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 22:09:13 minecraft
