The Tale of fuzz1252 (438897615069773835)
bug-reports 2020-09-16 22:46:24 2006 trapdoors I think this happened because I placed four diamond plated trapdoors and than deleted two of them on the default material but it only shoes 2006 on diamond plated material and 2000 on all other material even though i have 8 trapdoors placed which are diamond plated
bug-reports 2020-09-16 22:48:54 i can place 2008 trapdoors
bug-reports 2020-09-16 22:51:57 it can lag the game by like lest say someone places a 1000 parachute and thane depose it all at the same time it would crash the game
