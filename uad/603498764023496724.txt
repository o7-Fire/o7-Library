general 2021-09-07 12:59:38 im not defending gaijin but look at what happened when they listened to the community
general 2021-09-07 13:00:14 yes, some changes listed by the community are good, but generally whenever gaijin listens, people start hating on it
general 2021-09-07 13:00:38 gaijin does one thing that the communnity wants and now the community dislikes it
general 2021-09-07 13:09:49 Ive also noticed that theres always 2 sides are more in the community hating on whatever the fuck each want

general 2021-10-21 07:08:41 Finished f4 phantom research
creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:37:17 the nose is a bit to blocky for the a330
and the wings need to be thicker and the tail should end at less of a sharper angle
creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:43:30 for the nose you could try using half wedge 1* by 2 into a 1* by 2 normal wedge
creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:48:21 abit like that but try smoothing it out towards the fuselage
and try make the cockpit match the nose i guess
For the tail you could try motorlocking but if you dont want to thats fine
 vert stab will look better like 1 block thick
For the wings you could try making it 1-2 blocks thick towards the middle and half a block thick towards the end
creations-chat 2021-10-24 04:51:14 also try improving the "roof" above the cockpit filling the gap and blend it towards the fuselage more not just with a sudden 0.5 block rise
