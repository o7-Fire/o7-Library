plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:28:31 question, is it possible for mini biplanes to survive slamming into a cutter going 300+ studs per hour (which i assume is the mesurmant of speed in this) to survive slamming into cutters,ERA with everything maxed out except for radius,10 guns hitting it directly, 4 direct hits from fireworks, 3 direct hits from new and legacy setting rockets and still manage to fly perfectly fine? (with no evidance of motor lock)
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:28:59 ah, i see
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:29:11 my tank goes fast as hell
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:29:41 what about maxed out ERA with its radius being set to 3
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:29:54 how fast?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:30:16 strange
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:30:43 my plane is slower than my tank 💀
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:31:06 my tank goes around 700 sps before exiting the base plate
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:31:50 it was a biplane that slammed into me
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:32:03 somehow survived
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:32:08 oh yeah,
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:32:11 and a lava spitter
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:32:22 it spent only a few seconds within it tho multiple times over
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:33:59 how can u send pictures?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:34:39 im saying within the discord cha-
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:46:34 <@683015364975657024> i got a good screenshot of my tank could i show u what the biplane slammed into?

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 01:37:53 how are planes so durable and OP
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 01:53:59 Context for this question: shot a plane 2 times with a rocket 12 times with fireworks and used 12 machine guns on it with no affect.
general 2022-10-20 22:12:10 do you guys think there'd be more anti air stuff within game
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:13:15 do you guys think there'd be more anti air stuff or things like proximity explosives?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:16:51 question
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:17:23 why do my missiles bounce off with my explosives set to impact and do nothing
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:18:59 strange
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:19:12 do you know how to make them stick to vehicles?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:19:39 or planes?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:36:01 im using guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:36:50 i'll try

plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:39:58 ***WHAT DID YOU SAY***
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:41:02 too bad the explosives take half a second to exeplode
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:41:20 is there anyway to make IRCM
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:41:56 because this mig is doing fucking backflips and spamming missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:43:05 how do you make it so itself gets stuck to something else
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:43:53 wait how
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:46:19 magnets only work for yourself sadly
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:48:11 rip
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:48:26 no fucking way were in the same server
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:48:41 im the saltier than McDonald's french fries dude
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:48:50 with the missiles that barely work
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:50:27 alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:51:31 they are low quality as i dont want to crop
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:51:38 green tank with brown bottom
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:51:44 2 missiles with guns

plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:53:44 o
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:53:53 theres a mig that can backflip and spam missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:03:59 man stfu
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:05:13 looks fine to me
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:05:41 only problem is there is no half block wedge 1x0.9
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:06:07 what can i improve on then?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:06:35 tf is a whitename?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:07:03 ah, i see
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:07:35 so what if i dont have roles?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:08:39 how would my standards and expectations be inaccurate?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:09:19 wtf is that
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:09:42 anyway you can ig
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:11:42 nice BF109 (i'd assume it is)
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:12:18 eh, not an expert on planes or really know about them. So I usually get them wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:12:51 nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:17:36 how be anti shredder when shredder is using blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:22:53 why don't my missiles explode directly on contact
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:23:06 and instead bounce off
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 03:11:27 My first very low quality shitpost I made: Using guided missiles in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 03:41:20 Oh, I was implying the ones you build yourself not exploding on impact and rather a second later and ricocheting off any surface but that works too
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 13:09:50 Question
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 13:10:13 Why does it take a second or 2 for on impact explosives to explode
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 13:25:15 What’s the max limit of ping then? I avg 140-170ms
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 13:44:33 I want that glitch now that way me and my friend can build together
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 13:44:56 Damn that sucks
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:25:10 do you guys think that there will be HESH
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:25:42 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:26:15 good for AA
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:26:29 on impact missiles do not work
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:26:35 well explosives
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:26:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:26:51 high explosive squash head
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:27:00 it squashes around the aircraft/heli
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:27:04 then boom
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:27:35 pog
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:28:15 another questiion
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:28:38 how do i make it so explosives actually explode on impact rather than 1-2 seconds after hitting the target
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:28:46 studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:28:56 np
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:29:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:29:36 I have a guided AA missile
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:29:45 it hits the target and bounces off
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:30:00 why is that?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:30:17 alr i'll try
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:30:29 i dont have a way to see how close the missile is doe
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:30:57 yeah no camera
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:33:53 uhhh
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:34:05 ah i see

plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:34:49 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 21:34:55 im too stupid to figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 20:33:34 would we ever get things like delays for releasing this or that?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 20:33:44 or moving this or that at certain times?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 20:34:47 like there is a second or 2 delay after pressing this key?
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 21:19:38 prolly a new update or somethin
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 21:19:42 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 21:20:04 anyone know how to fix the glitch where you cant see other people's builds
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 21:20:10 hmm

plane-crazy 2022-11-14 03:48:31 question
plane-crazy 2022-11-14 03:49:04 why do my explosives explode where they were prior to exploding and not their current position
plane-crazy 2022-11-14 22:00:02 how do i counter a glitch that flings vehicles away if it touches you
plane-crazy 2022-11-14 22:06:30 do i just fly/drive away?
plane-crazy 2022-11-14 22:07:39 I'll try thx
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 00:04:41 is there a votekick system in public servers
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 00:04:53 or a way to kick ppl out
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 00:05:36 currently having to face a laginator using smoke,blacklist warfare,spamming cutters, and abt anything to give an unfair advantage
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 00:08:31 now hes spawning an 18k build with many loose parts
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:44:38 is there a new type of shredder?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:45:06 bc theres a shredder i've never seen in game before
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:45:44 i got a low quality image
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:45:50 lemme post it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 17:46:43 here ya go

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:55:01 goofy ahh tank
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 18:58:50 i will troll with it if asked
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:00:39 found a shredder lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:01:06 best way to deal with shredder as ground target?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:02:53 i'm doing all of those
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:03:00 don't seem to be doing much
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:03:03 or moar gun/rocket?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:04:16 is 500 sps fast enough (tested via going down the area with plots)
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:05:13 it can go even faster if i add a few more engines
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:05:23 i removed them as i filled it with armor instead
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:06:31 pretty obvious,
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:06:41 ***D A R K   T H E M E***
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:09:12 made it a bit faster for a bit less armor in the back
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:09:31 https://tenor.com/view/gun-db-shotgun-gif-21597283
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:09:54 700 sps from the beginning of the plot thing to the end
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:10:24 its not
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:11:29 i wonder what its top speed is if I remove its side skirts
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:13:21 strange, still 700
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:13:51 i bet i can make it fly if i remove the turret and side skirts
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:14:22 IT UPDATE
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:14:25 IM HOPPIN ON

plane-crazy 2022-11-23 04:47:05 I would post a meme in response to this but idk what language that is
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 04:49:15 o i was thinking right then
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 04:50:13 
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 04:51:06 im partially mexican dont worry
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 18:54:25 Do you guys hate shredders? (any kind of them)
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 18:55:07 o
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 18:55:24 i meant like stand alone shredders that have an army or are shredder bugs or ball shredders
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 19:00:01 looks pretty nice in the photo
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 19:00:13 I'd say it should make for a nice build
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 23:33:01 is there any way to fix that annoying bug where vehicles turn invisable if you damage them in some way
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 05:11:44 what a nightmare for us ground forces
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 05:11:59 anyways nice erusia skin (idk how to spell it 💀)
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 13:05:57 god damn that looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:53:43 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:54:41 is there anyway to stop vehicles from turning invisible once damaged enough
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:55:05 its super annoying to be in the middle of a ground or air battle and have the enemy just turn invisible randomly
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:55:46 literally max graphics atm
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:57:32 the problem is if i shoot them only apart appears or it just falls off and at longer ranges its harder to see tiny parts in a plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:58:47 but i'll try
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:59:42 alr
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:59:51 lets hope it don't get too close to hit me
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:59:57 or decimate me
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:00:29 i do got a fast plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:00:35 it can tank some rounds depends on what
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:00:41 depends
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:00:50 rockets a bit depending where it hits
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:00:52 bullets hell yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:01:02 fireworks it don't do so great but it can take em
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:01:09 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:01:12 a bit
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:01:27 recieves crit damage but can fly
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:01:51 it'd prolly hit my wings or torso decimating the engine and flaps to turn
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:06 and maybe the tail as well and the thrust vectoring would be ruined
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:20 if it were from the back ofc
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:30 well, kinda
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:37 pretty much just a motor 2 on a servo
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:41 and an engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:02:47 hover engine to be specific
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:03:06 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:03:18 1 per engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:03:39 its my first actual plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:05:08 rip
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:05:15 place motorlock in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:05:24 put a HELL lot of props
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:05:27 and i mean a hell lot

plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:07:36 usually props and other engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:07:57 i'd show you how i do it with a clip but i'd get shidded on by the plane community within this
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:08:08 short for propellor
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:09:25 true
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:10:23 what are those front flap things that are by the front of the nose
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:11:25 motorlock it into the nose and keybind it to turn you left and right aong with up and down
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:11:56 i have canards with thrust vectoring to help with lift
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:11:59 i dont know why i did this
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:12:25 yeah, im prolly gonna get shidded on by the pc community
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:13:20 Aughhh.mp3
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:14:47 i threw on super rockets in on/off mode

plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:32:36 somehow
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 15:36:02 what you guys think of my goofy plane

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:47:00 speaking of missiles,
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:47:06 why is the homing so bad for missiles?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:47:25 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:48:25 do you think there'd be any chance plane crazy can have homing systems similar to that of actual missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:48:43 why is that?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:49:39 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:49:53 i wonder if there'd be a chance similar to neo warfare x
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:50:04 like you press a keybind for homing
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:50:21 then press again to launch it
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:50:48 me seeing 2 towers:

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:51:40 explains why my missiles don't know what aiming down is ***200ms gaming***
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:52:12 ima ask my parents if we can run an ethernet cord or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:52:36 i thought legacy had better homing 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:53:15 same with no legacy 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:54:32 so if i want faster missiles, go fast as hell?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:55:23 problem, im an aircraft, when i even attempt to turn at around 2,000 or 1,400 im hella unstable as soon as i turn
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:55:25 wait nvm
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:55:41 time to mount this on an aicraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:55:53 i accidentally made it that fast
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:56:20 its a custom crappy mig-21
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:56:35 if i even move a flap/aileron
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:56:37 it shakes
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:56:50 i fucking hate those
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:56:58 they just show up, launch missiles, and fly off
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:57:41 i hate those
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:57:42 facing one rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:57:56 i have a jet that can counter it
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:58:00 but i suck ass at dogfighting
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:58:26 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:58:49 its why i asked if there'd be a chance for things like neo warfare x missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:58:56 me a 100-200ms gamer:
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:59:36 im about to remove wings from this thing and only have them for airbrakes
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:59:45 and have disconnectors as "wings"
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 01:59:54 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:02:28 he might be using the landing gear provided by the game
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:03:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:06:38 how stop motor 2s from being unstable at higher velocities

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:10:33 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:10:41 i recon find a way to make it fit
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:10:46 even if it does make it a bit more ufly
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:10:48 ugly*

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:11:30 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:11:45 make it turn as it goes within the wing or body
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:11:48 so it fits
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:12:12 hes not lvl 3 (i dont think anyways)
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:13:03 "it looks kinda mid for me"

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:14:42 actually,
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:15:22 whoever the hell told me to use fabric wings i thank you
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:15:55 my plane is hella stable w/ fab wings and using motor 2 at 1,400 sps
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:16:16 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:16:43 but i prefer functionality over looks tbh

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:18:49 plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 02:19:52 what is elite engineering
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 03:10:38 o
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:51:03 tbh, i see nothing wrong with "military" groups as long as its not taken seriously or anything crazy.
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:51:56 also how do i make guided missiles more effective?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:52:19 Fired a bunch off and nothing hit despite being like 20 blocks away
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:52:36 and all they had to do was go down
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:52:38 like 2 studs
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:52:54 yet it misses
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:53:03 same
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:53:10 i've built those and hate them
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:53:15 effective sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:53:17 otherwise nah
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:53:39 barely works for surface to air combat
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:54:03 even if used against tanks or ships
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:54:07 most of the time it fails
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:54:14 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:54:59 even then they sometimes bounce off or detonate too late (thanks to ***200ms gaming***)

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 02:48:18 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:21:17 why is dogfighting with jets in this just hopping your missile hits
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:23:05 you just kinda gotta hope it knows what going in any direction is
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:25:04 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:25:35 will this ever be fixed or updated or did the devs say "fuck this"
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:26:24 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:26:35 especially one thats at least stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:26:51 i remember my friend made like a 1x7 block missile
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:27:03 dont even know how
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:27:19 hell prolly smaller
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:27:36 pretty much
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:28:46 i wonder if i can make a super compact missile thats like a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:28:54 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:21 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:23 and flares
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:28 along with radar guided and chaff
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:45 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:50 idea:
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:29:59 you need a radar on the plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:30:20 and whichever direction the plane points is where you can lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:30:28 what i was thinking lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:30:52 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:07 you can lock easier at the cost of a tiny bit of damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:14 much better homing a bit worse damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:25 ehhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:30 you can use 12
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:32 but
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:31:37 only like 1 or 2 launch at a time
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:32:09 we gotta get the guys from neo warfare x 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:32:30 brb
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:32:53 back
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:33:02 not really
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:33:16 i mean, yeah they have good guidance
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:33:30 but cant really do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:35:01 or the edges of wing panels and control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:35:04 due to air friction
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:19:31 i like the third one'
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:19:32 looks nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:21:53 i'd say something but i'd get flammed by you guys
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:23:14 alr lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:29:36 state of pc rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:29:46 *jet chasing a biplane*
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:10 can fuel blocks act as armor?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:21 like against what?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:34 o
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:39 pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:52 idek
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:58 i wanted to try limited fuel
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:03 was wondering if it could act as armor
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:11 also wireless fuel 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:36 i use tnt armor
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:42 mostly in my side skirts
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:09 same
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:22 an older variant of my tank had tnt roof armor
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:36 there should be ground and air missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:49 air explodes 360 but a bit less damage than ground
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:59 ground is like heat
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:15 does more damage than air but only explodes where it makes contact
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:19 would be pretty cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:43 strange
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:45 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:55 as from my understanding
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:18:13 its not just "damage blocks in x,y,z radius"
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:18:29 but rather "tgfhjj3r9u7qaftpg4we4frgouaewfguhpaworigtu534qotp4uiuj[][][][]eqfygar9w30pgjeuwoiratgwrfhg"
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:18:40 (idk lua code)
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:22 there should be armor blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:09 LIKE THIS?!?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:18 i have mobility and heavy armor
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:22:10 goofy tank with heavy armor that goes around 500 with a suspension that can be enabled and disabled along with anti shredder cababilities
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:16 i have a variant of my tank
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:20 with guided missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:21 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:40 would be a shame if i were to blow it up with fireworks or missiles or guided missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:25:12 nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:25:24 though it would be a shame...
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:26:02 now thats nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:26:28 would be a shame if i were to go in circles around you with pretty good armor despite having almost all armor removed
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:31:40 this somehow has enough lift and power to take off and glide slightly
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:32:46 toxic communities!
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:32:59 can i see the build?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:33:40 das fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:34:14 same lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:34:19 i'll try and offer some advice
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:34:39 tru lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:34:50 dont really care abt looks as long as its good
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:35:15 rblx is also full of idiots/incompetant people
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:11 for example, saw some idiot try to get on my plane (travels around 1k within a few seconds great for short takeoff) while i was taxing and taking off
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:20 i took off and the dude flew off
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:27 then blammed me 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:41 /\
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:44 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:37:01 and from another game (MTC4) there are even dumber people
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:37:33 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:37:55 i told a dude to turn off hatch locks so i can close the hatches, refused we got slapped with high explosive and killed everyone due to the hatches being opened
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:38:19 then dude tried to pin it on me (which i have no control over hatch locks only the driver does in the game)
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:39:43 i then went solo and dude followed me, i was trying to stay hidden by crouching and doing all of the "tactical" stuff and dude sticked out like a sore thumb blaming me for getting spotted despite being brighter than the color white or pure yellow and firing off his god damn gun.
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:39:50 not too bad!
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:40:04 can i recomend a motor 2 type of thing for the missiles and gun?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:40:43 that F/A-18 (or F-15) looks tiny compared to those mig-29s
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:41:06 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:41:49 sorry
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:42:10 im not too good at identifying aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:42:31 Mig-31B in the middle and Su-57s?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:43:03 POV: that mig between the sukhois
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:43:43 im the shortest in my entire grade 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:43:50 i like being small has many advantages tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:05 im catching up to you
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:30 14yrs 5'1 (fucking genes)
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:48 its ok tailed fox nine
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:59 being smaller has better advantages
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:45:01 for example;
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:45:06 your harder to hit if you play airsoft
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:45:16 lucky
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:45:24 fitting in the trunk*

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:06:08 sign out of all other sessions
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:06:58 also its sometimes a glitch where if you rejoin or join another game without exiting the game that happens

plane-crazy 2023-01-28 14:26:03 y'all why tf are people putting german no no symbols on stuff ingame
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 14:26:29 isin't it a hate symbol?

plane-crazy 2023-01-31 14:22:55 ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 23:56:03 what speed is mach 1 in sps?
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 23:58:02 assuming its slowly turning to the side by its rotation, you need a counteracting force (tail rotor or another propeller spinning in the opposite direction but symmetrical and must be spinning double the speed on the motors to counter the first set of motors spinning the rotor)
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 23:59:14 jesus christ i've gone double that
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 23:59:23 unintentionally
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:01:26 whar?
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:02:39 how high of a velocity are you spinning it?
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:02:57 motors and motor 2s can glitch out at 1200+
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:04:33 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:04:47 is there any loose parts like connected to unpowered motor 2s?
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:04:59 yup das why
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:05:11 or, what i assume is the issue
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 00:05:44 is the swash plate the loose part?
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:23:15 german water propellors 💀
