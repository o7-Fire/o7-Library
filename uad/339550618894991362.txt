The Tale of Blade_Klinge (339550618894991362)
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:24:12 This is the Plongeur, my second sub and my second creation in the game. This is something I'm very proud of from how it's balanced, it's a little bow heavy and along with the placement of the the belly thrusters this sub always dives or submerges nose first, but not just that. The way it's balanced along with, again, the placement of the thrusters the ship surfaces almost completely level above water. Another cool thing about this sub is, though I haven't attempted to install them yet, there will be ten rockets installed where you see the grey blocks. Of course they will be installed slightly raised as to not explode in the almost submerged sub. Had a really good time making this.

creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:30:26 Just did thanks a lot
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:31:57 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:03:40 Quick question cause I'm not in game, are rockets aimable or do they just go straight in the direction they're pointing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:03:54 Thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:05:38 Would you say a submarine filled will horizontal torps op? Like would it be effective in sinking enemy ships?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:06:45 How the hell do I do that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:13:15 Do rockets ever reload?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:13:43 What's the reload time?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:13:57 Pretty good
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:17:18 Rockets don't fire underwater right they just up and explode?
help 2018-12-23 04:21:41 Can rockets fire underwater?
help 2018-12-23 04:24:16 Also, I can't get in game so I can't answer this myself but, how do rocket reloads work? Do they reload immediately after the rocket fired before has exploded? Or is there a reload time after said rocket exploded or does the reload start immediately after firing a rocket?
help 2018-12-23 04:25:07 Gotcha
help 2018-12-23 04:25:27 I get your point, gotcha

creations-chat 2018-12-26 19:23:41 Thanks
creations-chat 2018-12-26 23:45:17 Fixed version of my weaponized submarine, I found that it's rockets had a hard time launching without risk of blowing the ship up so I just raised them a bit, for breathing space y'know.

With it working properly, I can actually say it's pretty effective as a pvp ship, it can dive and hide from enemy fire whenever it wants and I found that to take down ships aircraft get really close to the ship in order to drop some bombs. So I installed a bunch of vertical rockets to blast them out of the sky, it's pretty fun.

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:45:05 Can you use magnets in the same sort of way as motor hinges to make longer stuff?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:46:09 So no?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 13:08:01 Do torpedoes work underwater now?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 13:09:32 Torpedoes I meant rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 13:09:55 Hey
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 13:11:21 Now that's eüÖ±Ô∏èic
creations-chat 2019-01-25 14:15:57 Oooo u boot
creations-chat 2019-01-26 22:46:10 So this is my little anti-aircraft submarine, I tried to make it look nice but I also think it has pretty unique mechanics as well.

So pretty much I went with the bare minimum of downward thrust to push the sub underwater. There's only about 6 rocket engines plus a few jet engines. Because of this if they were centered perfectly so the ship doesn't cavitate while going down, they would barely work and the boat would have a rough time even getting below the surface, but they aren't centered perfectly. They're placed a little closer to the bow so the ship cavitates nose downward when it dives. This is so the stern will be pointed upwards so the boat can use its back thrust to help push the boat to deeper depths. So yeah, it actually has to move in order to dive, like an actual sub.

Also, this boat IS weaponized, as I said it's AA, so it's armaments consist of a line of 7 vertical rockets so when an aircraft gets close I can just blast them out of the sky, works pretty well if you time it right.

The sub is based is on the Polish Orzel class class and the Russian Shchukas class.

bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:42:31 So i left this one server because my submarine when i spawned it on the water just started flipping all over the place, this hadn't happened before so I looked for some rocket i accidentally placed but there were no visible problems, so i left the server and rejoined and i get this. This awful cluttered mess which used to be my fully functioning submarine which i spent hours on. And nothing about the block count has changed in the save file, but when i load up the file nothing changes.
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:45:34 nope
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:45:39 still the same
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:47:00 its my only save
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:47:11 i dont like my old stuff so i delete them
bug-reports 2019-01-27 17:20:03 It's been a few hours and my sub is still all messed up, is there anything that can be done?
bug-reports 2019-01-27 18:46:31 When's that?
bug-reports 2019-01-27 22:03:36 Nope, nothing's happening
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:40:34 This is my new little sub, like the previous boat she uses minimal downward thrust just to push her a little below the surface, all the while cavitating her nose downward so the rear thrust can help push the boat to deeper depths. 

Her armaments are pretty minimal due to the limited space and my greater desire to keep the boat clean and beautiful. With those armaments consisting of anti-sub guns at the bow (mounted inside the hull) an anti-ship deck gun, and 2 anti-ship mines which have proved to be the most effective. I'll just sneak up and slip under a surface ship where I'll deploy a mine and they're pretty much done for.

The boat's design was inspired by the Russian Hotel class.
