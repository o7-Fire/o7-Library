plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:18:59 wel
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:19:06 not really play time
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:19:18 a lot of it is just hanging out with people
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:19:24 id say 2/3 is playing
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:19:26 maybe less
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:20:23 wait its either 60 days or 60 hours lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:20:32 probs days
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:20:33 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 07:21:01 do you think i could get a build in hall of fame?
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:19:45 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:20:49 Disconnectora are good for some things but sometimes you have to use springs
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:22:30 If you don’t have a private server what are you gonna do lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:22:45 And I know pvp is an option but
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:22:46 Comeon
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:22:53 It pretty much isint
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:24:13 Yeah like for small builds you can use disconnects a decent amount but springs are needed
bot-central 2021-12-08 22:24:50 How many more words are needed?
general 2021-12-08 22:25:30 You only need this?
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:27:13 Sadly no
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:27:29 I guess I would have to use horns but that takes up too much room
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:27:40 And would look weird
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:29:25 Yeah but I have glass on my car
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:29:30 In the front at least
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:29:36 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:29:42 Maybe I can turn it upside down
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:29:52 But you would see the other side point out :((
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:30:29 I think you could turn it upside down and it would look
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:30:32 Decent
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:32:00 Nvm lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:32:25 If I used a pistons and lowered it
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:32:29 Maybe
bot-central 2021-12-08 22:32:39 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:33:10 Maybe a half a piston or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:35:55 Only problem is I can’t add much on anymore cause of room lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:36:01 I have like no room
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:36:09 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:36:22 There’s no way to connect more towers
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:36:36 Cool when I get home I’ll add some
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:36:49 I did that recently for the new light bar
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:37:18 When I get online I’ll show you what I mean by I have no room
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:39:11 What build do you think will be liked most?
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:40:34 Polar express, ecto 1, daylight train, Halloween house
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:41:17 I’ll take a pic
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:41:24 And edit it to look like a poster
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:42:29 Sorta like that
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:42:34 For that
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:42:42 I took the cover of a real movie poster
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:42:51 And pasted it onto the house image
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:43:06 Yeah that’s a old pic
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:43:10 That’s before the other houses
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:43:40 You know hat sucks
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:43:47 I have it pretty much done
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:43:58 But I have 1 tree left to build
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:44:03 But literally no room
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:44:09 The whole plot is full
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:45:08 Op

plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:47:26 Front end will be difficult
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:48:05 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:48:14 The only scale i build in pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:48:23 It’s just more challenging and fun
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:48:35 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:48:38 Piston crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:49:17 Damn that’s even harder
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:50:23 I may have to make it a 67-68
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 22:50:28 Due to the nose

plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:16:07 oh

plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:23:31 lol it was hard to find any hair of face cause none fit him
creations-chat 2021-12-21 01:49:13 i did
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 04:58:00 im building a W1 trench what do you guys think so far? (its far from done ill add tons more detail later)
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 04:58:14 where?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 04:58:58 i saw a ton of other people do trenches but they all looked kinda bland (because mainly none of the walk ways were angled like irl) so i wanted to try
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:00:48 yeah its like in a rough draft type stage rn, im about to start adding details like, water pools, artillery holes, blood, rock, etc
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:01:01 theres a bunker room
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:01:14 i was thinking of adding a blown up tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:01:36 not sure if i have room though
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:02:02 again its barely started i only did detailing in the trench im about to start the exterior
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:02:57 
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:03:25 it has sandbags
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:04:00 
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:04:05 no you cant
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:04:21 every walk way you see is angled
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:04:42 you need motor lock to make trenches like this
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:05:11 theres 3 short walk ways that arent angle locked
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:05:21 thx
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:06:01 you need motor locking to make the plank walk ways aswell, and the ladders, the the bridge, and the sand bags, and every other detail ill be adding
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:06:15 if you can make a trench that looks as good as mine without motor lock ill call you god from now on
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:07:08 derp send me one of your builds
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:08:28 what is that?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:08:52 send me a real build
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:11:50 im not gonna say anything (if you know the saying "don't say anything if you have nothing nice to say")
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 05:12:27 actually, i take that back the coloring is not painful

plane-crazy 2022-01-16 04:30:31 <@!668314196764655618>
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:19:59 Difficult
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:22:22 I was able to do the lights but still trying the roof
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:22:56 I think I may just have the roof a half block in
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 00:36:44 nice
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 00:37:29 are you saying people who make "mini builds" suck?

plane-crazy 2022-01-18 00:38:08 sry im dumb
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 00:38:13 oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 00:06:07 i haven't worked on it in a little bit
creations-chat 2022-02-06 00:09:13 no?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 00:11:39 what do you mean?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 00:13:48 ohhh he's saying this channel is so toxic and since my build is about a war he's comparing them. sorry im dumb lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:01:41 damn that's very nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:01:52 i hope they do well with the body
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:01:58 sometimes the front end is nice but the body ruins it
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:03:13 id sometimes make a nice front end but because of the cylinder sizes i wouldn't be able to make the rest
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:06:15 its gonna have a resize tool?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:06:25 that's gonna be amazing
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:06:45 wait what?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:06:57 they are keeping pistons and stuff right
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:08:00 they are keeping motor lock right?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:08:08 that's the biggest deal
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:08:15 thank goddd
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:09:06 probs more than half even
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:09:27 i almost left when i heard it was not gonna be in-plane crazy but then they patched it
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:09:56 remember that time when it was broken for like 4 days?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:08:51 I go to school
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:08:56 So
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:08:59 Kinda hard
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:09:28 But yeah control surface angle locked
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 23:08:05 <@!401530469952389130> how does my tiger 1 wheel base look
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 23:08:18 
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 23:08:24 
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 23:15:12 thx
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 23:15:27 i tried to make the wheels correctly placed cause i haven't seen it done before
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:43:38 <@!401530469952389130> i added the body
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:44:54 no imma make the main height of the body a little taller
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:45:30 mhm yeah
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:45:34 ill also lower it
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:46:49 wait can you join my game?
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:47:38 any pics of the turret?
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:48:00 i may also just use my old design
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:48:04 if its not too big
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:51:20 i think ill use my own design
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:51:28 
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:54:00 ha
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 23:54:02 game crashed
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 00:07:17 the old one was a little bit bigger
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 00:07:19 by like a half block
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 00:07:25 but yeah pretty much
creations-chat 2022-02-23 02:11:12 based on the width of a block and the width of a semi-truck it should be around 4 blocks wide and for some reason 7 blocks tall but that seems a bit much
