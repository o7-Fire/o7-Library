plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:52:40 So um
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:52:50 Why can’t I put images
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:53:05 I am smart
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:53:15 I have the big brain
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:54:51 Look I just wanted to join to send a screenshot of trillions of speed leave me alone ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:55:07 I have trillions
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:55:32 I would share screenshot but I apparently need to reach chat rank 3
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:55:39 I can reproduce it

bot-central 2021-11-27 08:02:18 Anyways how’s your day going?
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:02:36 Nice
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:02:47 I managed to get trillions of speed in game
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:03:17 Oh neat
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:03:19 Lemme do that
help 2021-11-27 08:03:37 
help 2021-11-27 08:04:17 Yeah so I made a new type of useless engine that is so powerful that it ignored attached anchored blocks
help 2021-11-27 08:05:23 It simply uses motors and suspensions and exploits the slight rng in the suspensions
help 2021-11-27 08:05:29 Because I am big brain
help 2021-11-27 08:05:36 Anyways ty
help 2021-11-27 08:05:47 I added trails and it looks pretty coo
help 2021-11-27 08:05:52 Another pic
help 2021-11-27 08:05:56 
help 2021-11-27 08:06:14 It is quite fun to completely ignore activated anchor blocks :)
help 2021-11-27 08:07:47 Lol
help 2021-11-27 08:07:57 I can show the machine sometime
help 2021-11-27 08:08:10 I have a screenshot of before I turn on the motors
help 2021-11-27 08:08:33 
help 2021-11-27 08:09:06 On the bottom there’s an anchor block so it stays floating
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:10:50 Out of curiosity had anyone else figured out the secret of hover engines and how they can be used to make super powerful easily controlled engines?

bot-central 2021-11-27 08:14:02 Yay
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:14:07 Ty
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:14:37 So close to being able to put my trillions of speed somewhere that isn’t <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:15:16 Kk good
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:15:54 Never seen anyone put suspension anywhere near a hovercraft part personally
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:16:01 I wanted a sanity check
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:16:42 Those engines are simply fun, smol, and allow your plane to get as close to an anchor block as you can possibly get without using an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:17:02 Even more fun is when you combine it with a supermagnet engine

general 2021-11-27 08:21:10 Neat
general 2021-11-27 08:23:56 Lemme guess su 23 was designed for supersonic speeds?
general 2021-11-27 08:24:03 Looks that way at first glance
general 2021-11-27 08:24:13 Lol
general 2021-11-27 08:24:26 Rip plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:25:45 Yeah signs look like a better contender there
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:25:56 Also how did you round the windows?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:26:09 Motors on clipping wedges??
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:26:47 I am smart

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:35:57 I probably come across that way yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:36:01 I can see that

bot-central 2021-11-27 08:36:48 Ayo level 3
bot-central 2021-11-27 08:37:10 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:37:21 Finally
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:37:28 
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:37:40 Unedited
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:38:00 
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:39:59 The engine is powered by an anchored block (activated 100% of the time, only there to keep it from moving until it had reached high enough speeds to ignore anchored blocks), a motor (technically 2 but 1 is never used), and entirely too much suspension. I added trails for fun and visualization :)
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:40:07 
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:40:27 ^motor is still off so it’s from before it’s actually used
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:40:37 
general 2021-11-27 08:42:05 Let me guess: you live in Ukraine?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:43:07 Yeah that sounds less fun lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:43:23 I prefer just messing around to create new types of engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:43:42 Maybe one day I’ll find one more useful than a jet engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:43:53 Or rocket engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:43:56 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:44:42 I don’t think an engine producing trillions of speed and ignoring anchored blocks is very useful
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:44:57 Fun? Definitely.
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:46:21 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:46:23 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:46:27 It looks good
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:46:54 ~~now can it go so insanely fast that it ignores anchored blocks?~~
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:47:06 I dont
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:47:42 I’m not one for the visual aspect of the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:47:52 I just like breaking things honestly
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:48:00 Which is how I got
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:48:30 Neat
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:49:08 It was from this
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:49:28 I still have no idea how to motor lock lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:50:05 Honestly should I put it in creations?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:50:21 Why?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:50:26 It’s a finished product
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:51:35 Probably, though in truth it took me over 18 hours to figure out how to use motors and suspension to ignore anchored blocks which allows the creation to take off at such speeds
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:51:41 Ooooo
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:52:30 People except renderings of stuff that looks realistic… from a blocky Roblox game
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:52:31 But yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:53:09 Sadly few appreciate simply breaking things using legit game mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:53:14 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:53:46 Nooo don’t
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:53:56 Use an alt to store stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:54:07 I have a combat alt for this game
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 08:54:25 Though my total Roblox alt count is over 40 something now so I’m not one to talk
bug-reports 2021-11-27 08:56:06 Still not 100% sure how it works but I used suspensions and a motor to ignore an anchored block, resulting in chaos
*the anchored block was attached and activated but was probably not what caused the insane speed
**this is 100% reproducible and I have it on one of my save slots, though it usually only reaches e+12 to e+14
creations-chat 2021-11-27 09:00:47 I would put my 18 hour creation in <#384025409945337856> except it is not designed to look particularly streamlined or anything, it only is for ignoring activated anchor blocks and moving at e+17 (trillions) of speeds

This means that even though I put work into it, it will probably be downvoted to an all new level because people expect a cool model, not a perfectly executed concept :(
general 2021-11-27 09:03:49 
general 2021-11-27 09:03:50 ;)
general 2021-11-27 09:04:07 Yeah that exists
general 2021-11-27 09:05:12 Yeah I should probably stop putting it everywhere for now
general 2021-11-27 09:09:33 I can tell you why in one sentence

Public discord server where everyone is anonymous
general 2021-11-27 09:10:28 Toxicity and hate run unpublishable, making it hard to stay in servers line these
general 2021-11-27 09:10:34 But they can be fun anyways
general 2021-11-27 09:10:47 Otherwise they wouldn’t exist lol
general 2021-11-27 09:11:25 It got one reply
general 2021-11-27 09:11:36 It was essentially ignored
general 2021-11-27 09:12:06 This was also essentially ignored
general 2021-11-27 09:12:49 Both examples never got anything constructive, but neither were they hated on because other conversations happened to be going on at the same time
general 2021-11-27 09:15:34 So in conclusion <@!466628021273624586> it’s not just your particular creations, is that you happen to send them at times when people will actually respond to your message. This may seem like a good thing, but in anonymous public servers, it just means that there is a larger supply of hate as it is infinitely easier to respond to something with an insult than it is to respond to something with a compliment
general 2021-11-27 09:15:48 Sorry for wall of text btw
general 2021-11-27 09:16:36 True statement, if “not all” means “none” which is indeed does mean
general 2021-11-27 09:17:42 That was not intended as a roast, more as a way to explain how public servers hate
general 2021-11-27 09:17:59 I see no way that that could be interpreted as a roast but ok
general 2021-11-27 09:18:07 Humans don’t make sense :)
general 2021-11-27 09:18:18 What else can he say?
general 2021-11-27 09:18:31 Lol
general 2021-11-27 09:18:36 No
general 2021-11-27 09:18:57 Recapcha would have gotten them a long time ago
general 2021-11-27 09:19:45 A single English alphabet is 26 individual characters, not counting spaces, which for some reason count as numerals,,,?
general 2021-11-27 09:20:26 That would work yeah
general 2021-11-27 09:23:39 Right but English is also technically Germanic because there was never a point at which we crossed the threshold between Latin and Germanic, meaning even though Roman Vikings took the English throne the English language is still technically Germanic as there is no defined turning point.

In short, we are all technically speaking modernized Germanic
general 2021-11-27 09:24:02 Which is also the German language
general 2021-11-27 09:25:39 The Pythagorean theorem is about triangles and takes about 10 seconds to explain. I can do this all day and all night, are you even trying anymore?
general 2021-11-27 09:26:06 That must be one heck of a car ;)
general 2021-11-27 09:28:27 Quadruple*
general 2021-11-27 09:28:44 And I’m not even going to argue with that statement
general 2021-11-27 09:28:55 As it is beyond mortal comprehension

general 2021-11-27 09:38:30 ABCD divided by DCBA = 1, simply because they are all variables, only being multiplied in different orders. This basically means that 3x1 = 1x3, meaning ABCD=DCBA, meaning your equation simplifies to 1 divided by 1, which equals 1. Next.
general 2021-11-27 09:39:28 Used to be just 1 but they got together to co-own which makes sense for a game that blew up that fast
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:00 I have
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:23 I just do t really need motoock
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:35 No it’s legit and reproducible
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:38 I made it myself
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:42 
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:45 Also does this
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:40:55 I added trails for visualization
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:41:08 It ignores anchored hlocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:41:22 Attack a motor to an anchored block
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:41:31 Now attack another motor to the first motor
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:41:39 First motor is never used ever
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:41:56 Second one needs max speed and torque as well as powered and toggle on
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:42:04 Attach*
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:42:56 Then attach an unholy amount of suspensions at 0 for every stat except length, max for length
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:43:05 Add trails to every suspension
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:43:09 Turn on motor
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:43:18 If you built it right it might work
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:43:29 I have one that works 100% of the time on one of my saves
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:43:46 For the first 5 seconds it actually sits in place because anchored block
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:44:04 Yeah I can
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:44:52 After the first 5 seconds it builds up a good couple million speed, enough to start ignoring anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:44:57 Then it takes off
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:45:16 And I can completely control it if I make 1 minor adjustment
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:45:25 Using hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:45:43 You of course can’t land it
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:45:56 Because it moves at speeds upwards of the trillions
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:46:43 And the screenshot of it was in 1 frame of a 90 fps video, hence the long trail
general 2021-11-27 09:47:35 That single statement is more intelligent than his entire argument ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:48:14 Well
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:48:37 The build before spawn was 7x5x7
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:49:06 After spawn is was 30x30x30 because suspension
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 09:49:25 It’s like 25 parts very maximum
general 2021-11-27 09:49:48 Btw the next generation of humans has already been born
general 2021-11-27 09:49:54 Just saying
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:07:39 remember my machine with trillions of speed ignored anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:08:28 that matters not
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:08:42 if it ignores one it ignores as many as you want
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 00:25:22 high-tier blackmail material right there
bug-reports 2021-12-01 00:30:47 roughly 400 trillion speed, the bottom known bug in the known bugs list might want to be updated, motors will either not move or they will do this:
bug-reports 2021-12-01 00:31:55 it was a motor + anchored block bug
somehow i got a motor with max speed and torque to move suspension at insane speeds and the suspension SOMEHOW interacted with the anchored block with physics off
bug-reports 2021-12-01 00:32:11 this essentially tuned the physics back on without me using the keybind
bug-reports 2021-12-01 00:32:24 and it flung me into the next universe
bug-reports 2021-12-01 00:32:46 kk
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 00:34:37 make sure your balls dont move at trillions of speeds when an anchor block is attached to the motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 00:34:39 otherwise this happens
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 00:34:40 
help 2021-12-01 00:35:45 how do i uh

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:35:36 ...yes thats just one of my friends...
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:46:49 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:46:52 neat
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:36:51 i worked really hard on this plane what do you think?
creations-chat 2021-12-02 02:37:49 I worked really hard on this plane, and I even added a custom background! Is this worthy of <#384025409945337856>?

plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:33:48 Also what did you actually do with 10k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:36:57 Ayo what’s the current save max size
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:37:00 For one slot
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:37:36 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:37:48 Max save total data?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:37:56 I believe 300k but I’m not sure?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:39:00 K
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:39:06 So 400,000?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:39:11 I think that’s how that works out
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:39:17 I should double check
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:42:31 No
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:42:56 260,000
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:50:48 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 03:50:56 O wait

plane-crazy 2021-12-02 05:01:48 rounded wedges?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 05:01:59 though those are better for replacing pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 05:02:08 tiny half wedges could work
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:14:24 Why does everyone feel the need to base planes off of stuff from real life
i dont understand lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:16:31 so um why
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:16:34 does everyone
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:16:44 downvote when something isnt based off of real life
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:16:48 or isnt super abstract
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:19:57 yeah i havent put anything
i can still observe other creations and their upvotes/downvotes and compare to those that are effortless but modeled off of real life and those that are made with a ton of time and effort but dont exist irl
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:21:15 
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:21:16 this
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:21:19 thats what
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:21:31 i mean its beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:21:47 but those that do look good are still downvoted lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:26:38 one sec
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:30:03 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/915784963549437962
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:30:51 there seems to be a correlation between realism and upvotes, and its weaker when you look at the abstract or made up stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:32:16 there is no way that its based off of that... if so then yes it does deserve downvotes lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:32:27 the paint and design is so far off
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:33:28 i like the build, but i think its the size and obvious effort that got it that much attention, not realism and not abstraction
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:34:15 when unfolded and flying it is larger than the plot size which is more than i can say for a good 90% of the builds in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:34:33 there is a reason why i didnt
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:34:54 ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:34:56 yes i know
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:35:31 images you showed were looking like that and size doesnt neeed to be compared to the plot or other planes anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:36:10 im not saying size is everything ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:36:28 lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:36:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:36:44 much effort went into this build
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:36:54 "none"
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:37:01 this is true
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:37:44 and yet so many dont get that kind of attention
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:38:29 true
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:39:28 the justifications in <#504436696021204992> seem to trend towards small details that don't quite match real life or the fact that it is something that might be real but doesn't exist irl

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:44:22 large enough to work on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:44:25 maybe not in real life
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:44:26 but then again
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:44:31 real life
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:45:11 hut does it work on plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:45:28 ~~and does it have a hover drive?~~
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:45:37 can it move around just the same
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:45:52 hover engines used to move more effectively
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:45:59 it allows for much better movement of stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:15 like amazingly good control of speed and high speeds as well
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:22 basically
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:28 hover engine facing sideways
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:41 facing towards a block that is connected only by suspension
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:43 or ropes
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:44 or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:50 as long as it isnt a normal block type
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:46:57 suspension works best
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:47:06 i have
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:47:08 no idea
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:47:39 i guess im proud of figuring out that they exist and can be an amazing substitute for actual engines on a plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:47:41 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:48:28 ~~yes i have made planes that have no propellers, rocket engines, jet engines, etc. to make a flying machine better than most~~
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:07:02 This is why some of the biggest animals on earth don’t die of cancer
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:07:23 The cancer simply gets cancer before it grows and spreads enough to affect the animal
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:07:33 And it has time to do so bc of the animal’s size
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:07:47 This applies mainly to anything between an elephant and blue whale
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:08:23 Yes that’s the name
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:08:28 I forgor
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:08:54 I’m gonna try to make a shredder ball later
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:08:55 If I can
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:09:06 Hover drives are nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:09:22 They should work well for this
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:09:53 Hmm maybe magnets + ropes so the ball can be empty
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:09:57 This may be interesting
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:10:27 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:08:08 Lmao yes 2 keyboards

general 2022-01-06 05:47:56 I also don’t use motor lock though

general 2022-01-06 05:51:15 Using the power of 3 trillion speed, any race is trivial
general 2022-01-06 05:51:54 I have a sc of 3 trillion speed :)
general 2022-01-06 05:52:02 Yeah
general 2022-01-06 05:52:42 And that’s why I use 3 trillion speed :)

general 2022-01-06 05:53:38 3.9 trillion speed :)
general 2022-01-06 05:53:46 I did but
general 2022-01-06 05:53:50 The planes are weird
general 2022-01-06 05:54:00 Their center of gravity is still bound to original blocks
general 2022-01-06 05:54:11 Making carriers only possible with alts
general 2022-01-06 05:54:14 Sadly
general 2022-01-06 05:54:54 Again 3 trillion speed wins easy

general 2022-01-06 06:01:01 Uh no?
general 2022-01-06 06:01:08 I just found a bug
general 2022-01-06 06:01:10 That’s all
general 2022-01-06 14:55:00 <@315262125113081856> = bot?
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:04:17 Just use wedges to make a 1.5 by 1.5
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:05:08 Or use the wheels as deco and use hover engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:05:51 Or, better yet, max speed conveyors on bottom of tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:06:02 As your only method of propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:06:29 I once made a plane powered by conveyor belts
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:06:32 And it works
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:06:46 Top speed is 600
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:05 So basically
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:13 If the conveyor isn’t connected to your plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:15 But stuck in it
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:19 Lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:24 You get to hear it anyways
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:32 It will provide propulsion anyways
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:07:37 Similar to a hover engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:08:02 The only problem is putting it in a chamber of some kind and leaving it disconnected
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:08:14 Neat
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:08:23 But uh the right side seems to have a problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:08:56 
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:08:59 ???
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:22:40 Someone used motor lock to build a car so glitchy that if you touched it you would fly about 10,000 studs
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:23:08 So do you just not mute servers?
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:30:57 1. It’s level 3
2. No level requirement for <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:49:23 Depends on the context

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:49:41 What if I @ rickje

events-chat 2022-01-11 04:12:30 k fine
events-chat 2022-01-11 15:52:25 looks like fireworks and disconnectors which i believe are both banned
events-chat 2022-01-11 15:53:03 pathetic
events-chat 2022-01-11 15:53:30 MY boat top speed <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
events-chat 2022-01-11 15:53:57 3.9 TRILLION
events-chat 2022-01-11 15:58:04 kk
fireworks?
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:02:46 look its close enough
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:03:50 correction: 396 trillion
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:04:08 i think
if i did good maths
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:05:00 wha
no?
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:06:10 3.9611746519868e+17 = 3.9611746519868 x (10^17)

i think
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:06:38 in which case you just add 17 zeroes
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:07:16 which gets you 396,874,357,042,840
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:07:41 interesting but looks slightly easy to destroy guns
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:07:56 interesting but looks slightly easy to destroy guns
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:08:19 real quick is it against the rules to use an autoclicker in build mode?
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:09:05 ...building?d
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:09:39 lets say you misalign something and place 30 blocks on it
do you want to manually delete each block?
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:09:54 ye
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:11:12 the decimals are not part of e
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:11:37 you wouldnt add the number of decimals + e then multiply by 10^sum of decimals and e
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:12:27 e just moves decimal point to the left depending on the number
events-chat 2022-01-11 16:12:43 thats basically it
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:40:57 ive made a plane powered only be conveyor belts and its actually quite nice <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:41:13 wat da fak
events-chat 2022-01-11 20:00:41 Unguided is another word for very, very lazy guided missiles
events-chat 2022-01-11 23:48:59 
events-chat 2022-01-11 23:49:15 my boat uh is not supposed to do this...
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:33:32 ?
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:33:49 what do be the issue
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:34:07 yes i know it is large i really dont care lol
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:34:53 i was testing the turret alone in a pvp server on my base plot and nothing can stand against it on the ground, even shredders if i have half decent aim, so i am confident about putting it on the water
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:42:57 6
i only used 6
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:16:55 Yes, for small propellers it is 20,000, for normal propellers it is 2,222, and for large propellers it is 800
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:17:11 Unless you lock or fold outside of building area
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:18:31 100k+ on mine when it hit a ramp lol
the-dump 2022-01-12 17:21:40 Well I mean he did go to an art school
the-dump 2022-01-12 17:21:43 But other than that
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:21:53 Uh
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:22:15 So it looked like nothing crazy would happen because it was like a normal boat so I went towards a ramp
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:22:37 But when I hit the ramp my speed locked at 107,827 and wouldn’t change
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:22:55 Altitude bar was instantly cleared and I lost connection lol
events-chat 2022-01-12 17:23:12 It’s somewhat reproducible… sort of
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:34:33 
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:34:59 nothing wrong here
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:39:06 lmao
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:39:23 yeah i cant fix that nobody else has that problem i guess
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:43:36 i-
i tried
events-chat 2022-01-13 01:43:53 i may or may not have spent 8 hours trying to fix it lol
events-chat 2022-01-13 19:05:34 1 bote

events-chat 2022-01-14 00:03:51 Generally, when using just about any worldly language, it is generally a good idea to put spaces between numbers and words.
general 2022-01-14 00:05:05 Shredder boat >:)
general 2022-01-14 00:06:00 Lmao I remember randomly firing upwards with the smol deagle and getting a headshot kill on my first random shot
general 2022-01-14 00:06:05 It looked so sus lmao

> cant measure speed
juuuust slightly ominous...
events-chat 2022-01-14 05:58:18 Rookie numbers. I get 100-120 speed but sometimes it’s 1030000-1040000
events-chat 2022-01-14 05:58:42 Better plane tracking but worse boat tracking
events-chat 2022-01-14 05:59:07 It’s the old tracking system but rickje updated it and left an option for the old system still in the rocket settings
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:26:12 May have gotten it backwards
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:26:43 But I know it’s very situational and in this case you don’t want legacy
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:27:05 How…? In this game, that takes ages
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:27:22 Wait what I thought it only affected tracking
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:29:05 Yeah but 2 fast planes at the same time… you can’t ever strafe…
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:29:22 Never noticed a change there lmao
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:34:13 You end up constantly circling each other, never able to land a hit. This is why I use a giant, detailed, and accurately made turret

plane-crazy 2022-03-31 03:47:00 conveyor if you are brave
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 03:47:07 hover if you are just trying to make something work
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 03:48:19 conveyor ones are generally easier to destroy, harder to manage, and just generally more annoying, but they offer more speed and an unexpected form of engine.

hovers are long, so they need a bit more space, but they are way more stable and are better for combat and... well just about anything, provided you have the space. much easier to make and use.

general 2022-04-18 23:21:33 lmao
general 2022-04-18 23:22:21 honestly i see no point in the ranks
general 2022-04-18 23:22:27 what do they even do
general 2022-04-18 23:24:17 more like the fact that you actually went after roles, spending your time on changing the color of your name instead of doing something more useful like making huge folding gun replicas that have all the functional moving parts of real guns :)
my latest projects include a DEagle .50 and a colt .45
general 2022-04-18 23:25:06 the DEagle .50 is proving difficult with the slide - i need conveyors to be camera locked, which means its a little annoying to get them to work
general 2022-04-18 23:25:39 you technically have 5, which is 3 more than me, but why would you want roles? they seem to be a waste of time lmao
general 2022-04-18 23:26:23 yeah
general 2022-04-18 23:26:30 ah, so they do something? interesting

general 2022-06-13 21:42:54 yeah they are already gone
general 2022-06-13 21:43:06 yeah there are a ton joining and then getting banned
general 2022-08-24 23:29:54 <@335599526414909451> you appear to be the only online mod at this time
New discord scam is here, just got hit by it myself. It’s affecting members of this server. People are getting direct messages from others telling them to join a server which requires a QR code to verify themselves. Scanning this QR code results in a takeover of your discord account. It happened to me a couple hours ago and I didn’t know, so now at least two people from this server were sent fake dms. Just thought I should make mods of the servers I’m in aware of this.
Note: this is not “clicking a suspicious link” or anything like that. It looks quasi-legit until you hit the QR code. It backdoors discord from there.
general 2022-08-24 23:30:02 Kinda long message I know lol

general 2023-06-03 01:25:23 Lol google fail
general 2023-06-03 01:25:30 Slang moment
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:26:57 It’s in scientific notation 💀 
It’s actually 396,874,357,042,840,000
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:27:38 It just didn’t display the last four digits and might have rounded the fifth to last
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:27:43 Not enough space
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:28:02 That’s why it says e+17
general 2023-06-03 01:28:20 ~~Miminod~~
general 2023-06-03 01:28:59 Ayy I was correct
general 2023-06-03 01:31:11 ~~My hunger bar is 4 points down~~
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:31:35 Fair ig
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:31:44 That screenshot is over a year old now lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:31:52 It can definitely be pushed
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:32:28 I just put an anchor block down and attached a bunch of motors (they were not locked) and a bunch of ropes on the motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:32:35 Then locked the anchor block
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:32:39 Then spun the motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:32:45 They broke the physics I guess
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:32:59 It launched me and completely ignored the anchored block lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:33:08 It’s not hard to recreate iirc
general 2023-06-03 01:34:09 Mix well
Add 2 cups of water
Let stand 5 minutes
general 2023-06-03 01:34:24 Pfft wuausikvrnhquqoxknvr
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:34:57 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:35:41 I’m going to develop a way to send cutters to every possible location in a plane crazy server at once and you cannot stop me >:)
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:35:55 Pvp servers beware or something idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:36:24 No I mean bugging cutters so they they constantly exist everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 01:36:47 I might spend ~5 minutes messing with physics to do that and then get bored and do something else probably
