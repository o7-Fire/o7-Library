creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:28:44 is that a rounded answer
creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:34:26 1 meter = 1.42857 block
1 block = 0.7 meter

creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:10:18 you prioritize detail over functions?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:12:57 pvp or not, I value function just as much as the design, because I really don't enjoy having a good looking build that has limited functions, it's just my opinion that I like functions just as much as design (make a video on the functions 😳)
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:15:07 I actually thought ur nozzle could move up and down <:empty:794431705070174238>, turns out I overestimated something
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:18:21 I guess keeping the aesthetic while having a functioning nozzle becomes more difficult or not depending on the tank frame and design in the first place

general 2022-01-22 04:02:13 a block is no effort creation
general 2022-01-22 04:02:19 1 single block
general 2022-01-22 04:02:39 it is still considered low/no effort build
general 2022-01-22 04:02:42 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-01-22 04:03:53 that aint low effort because he motor locked yellow ball and trails in, while <@!772117586875777085> posted a literal block <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-01-22 04:05:30 so you are saying placing a block and posting in creations is a big effort build
general 2022-01-22 04:06:19 it only shows 1 block within the image 🗿
general 2022-01-22 04:06:48 he didnt show the motorlocks behind it
general 2022-01-22 04:07:44 even if you motor lock 1000 blocks into 1 block it is still looking the same as 1 block so why taking time putting 1000 blocks to look like 1 block 🗿
general 2022-01-22 04:08:12 I mean, u can just place 1 block and u will achieve what he showed within that image
general 2022-01-22 04:08:14 no magic

plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:28:29 does it affect explosion delay
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:28:33 also explosion radius
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:29:02 any downsides to increased blast pressure?
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:29:21 does lowering blast pressure do less dmg
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:29:56 so if I motorlocked cutters into a missile and have max blast pressure, that would make cutter shrapnels
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:30:35 btw, is there a way to make anti air missile easier
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 21:31:20 not sure if some people know this glitch,

creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:57:16 teleporter is definitely not allowed within the rules, what is 0g, how, if the vehicle have no weight I can slip
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:21:31 cool, if u read what I said, I only need performance, additional performance feedback, big or small, I will take it, if aesthetic feedback, I know what u are going to say already, some sacrifices have to be made for performance
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:24:22 winter wheels are the grippest things that exist in plane crazy, I tested it, winter wheels are still way better in cornering
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:26:48 then u can fuck off, I'm only here for performance feedback to dominate the F1 entry not some whining joe 🗿, I will dm u a video of the performance when I'm free later
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:29:05 active suspension system, soft anti roll bar, triple hybrid engine mix, extra adjustable wings both front and back before cornering, u can give me some more if u can think of one, I'm really trying to think of a good tech to add in
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:38:22 wdym elaborate
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:41:05 they aren't glitchy, they are just very very grippy, so grip u can flip from turning, if u have F1 downforce, u won't flip

doesn't matter, it don't mess with performance
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:44:37 im in an F1 entry that have certain rules, looking good isn't one of them

don’t care + didn’t ask + cry about it + stay mad + get real + L + cope harder + h0es mad + basic + skill issue + ratio + counter ratio + you fell off + the audacity + triggered + stay mad+ any askers + redpilled + get a life + ok and? + cringe + touch grass + donowalled + not based + your’re probably white + GG! + get good + go outside + not based + grammar issue + your're* + ad hominem + reported + you're a full time discordian + not funny didn't laugh + hahahahaha cry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:46:41 my F1 is not aesthetic based, im here for performance feedback not toxic aesthetic comments
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:49:58 so pcc is the wrong place to ask for F1 performance feedback <:empty:794431705070174238>

I posted specifically here for feedback on performance for the entry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:52:39 basically wasted time here explaining the existing performance tech components on my F1 but got nothing in return
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:27:08 should I report
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:29:11 ok I'll let him go 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:42:04 can I ask u for performance feedback in dms, here is useless other than people vomitting on me

creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:03:02 actually, I believe people just want to talk down on other people more than actually giving feedbacks, wouldn't change much if downvotes disappeared, slow mode too long im lazy to respond 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:05:57 im trying to learn to not have an ego and actually get along with people not like all of u 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:08:19 don’t care + didn’t ask + cry about it + stay mad + get real + L + cope harder + h0es mad + basic + skill issue + ratio + counter ratio + you fell off + the audacity + triggered + stay mad+ any askers + redpilled + get a life + ok and? + cringe + touch grass + donowalled + not based + your’re probably white + GG! + get good + go outside + not based + grammar issue + your're* + ad hominem + reported + you're a full time discordian + not funny didn't laugh + hahahahaha cry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:11:44 who's fault was it <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>, was it me not able to shut or was it people being toxic 🗿, also ur 4/14/2021 crazy dave post looks bad, could do better if u did motor lock and removes the disconnector rect prisms
general 2022-02-21 01:41:44 are they removing glitch engines in pc2

plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:15:11 once in a lifetime moment
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:15:32 yesterday was a day that wouldnt happen until the next 500 years
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:16:18 there is also a chance that is humanities' last chance seeing that day
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:16:31 low chance we would still exist within the next 500 years
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:17:11 i think 51 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:17:40 you can still test it
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:20:36 the more crazy u are the more <#504436696021204992> go crazy at you
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:49:33 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:49:59 yesterday was rare because it was Tuesday, 2/22/2022, 22nd day on Lunar calendar
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:50:14 in 2222 it would be Tuesday, 5/22/2222
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:50:17 not all 2's
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:50:48 then you are still experiencing one of the rarest days
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:51:05 the next time this will happen is roughly 500 years
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:16 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:22 you are completely wrong
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:27 in 2222
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:37 it is not tuesday on 2/22/2222
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:48 there is specific reason why yesterday is rare
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:43:59 including tuesday and lunar calendar
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:44:15 lunar calendar is 22nd
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:44:21 then it's also tuesday
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:44:27 then the normal calendar is also 2/22/2022
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 01:44:33 all 2's

general 2022-02-24 12:40:35 skill issue
general 2022-02-24 12:41:05 there is 2 ways to immediately stop hiccup so it really is skill issue
general 2022-02-24 12:41:27 I know how but it is too complicated to express through words
general 2022-02-24 12:42:19 easiest method is using water, drink a decent amount but dont swallow yet, hold your breath and swallow it, u will feel the water widening ur neck as it swallows down
general 2022-02-24 12:42:38 then if u do it right, it will fix hiccup immediately
general 2022-02-24 12:42:58 the other way is to use ur spit/hold ur breath for long
general 2022-02-24 12:44:11 skill issue

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:45:45 how fast do average fighter jets go
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:47:54 I don't think so looking at the volume and surface area
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:48:09 a cylinder does not even fully fit in a cube, so hypothetically, no
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:48:30 average plane crazy fighter jets
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:48:35 that's kinda slow
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:48:40 I expected somewhere near 1k
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:48:52 I needed a base speed to go above for my anti air missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:49:25 I want to be able to catch those annoying dive bombers that go at light speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:49:35 I'm developing a missile submarine
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:49:39 rockets cant reach underwater
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:49:44 I think
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:50:07 I guess I'll aim at 1k speed for those missiles
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:50:33 my ideal anti air missiles is to hit them before they know u are targeting them
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:51:07 main battle tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:51:12 tf is a microfighter 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:51:30 I had a weird concept
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:51:45 many mini drone jets in a big aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:52:47 those top fighter jets in plane crazy can go up to 10000?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:53:21 conveyor engined missile 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:53:55 well I better find out how to attach a conveyor engine onto compact missiles
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:54:37 do u guys know this glitch where u can see 3D view around the camera block u have
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:54:46 that's going to be useful for the missiles
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:54:50 wider view
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:22 wobble
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:32 isn't conveyor engine more stable
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:43 hover engine is not consistent
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:47 most pvp servers are laggy af
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:04 a bomber can end your hover engined crafts
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:15 they just drop bombs and lag u so much ur missiles stop working
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:23 lag bomb 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:57:00 for me, public pvp servers are just lag most of the time, not sure if it is region issue
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:57:45 pretty sure my pc can handle a simple roblox game if it could handle game like titanfall 2, and also my wifi goes at 300 mbps
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:58:40 but if more drag, most resistant to shake?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:58:59 that's very dependant on lag status, more lag means lower speed cap
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:10 where do u live 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:21 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:31 my country is **inconvenient** for a lot of games due to region
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:32 im aiming for a missile that can go beyond 1k with maintaining very stable
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:52 no
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:55 I dont need to turn fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:03 if I can go straight fast and turn accurately
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:07 that's all I need
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:13 further testing once I reached that state
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:32 no
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:38 it requires some form of aiming
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:43 you're chasing an active air target
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:48 that is going at supersonic
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:02 minimal 1k
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:13 minimal 1k
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:32 if opponent jet is slower than 1k, that will be convenient for the missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:39 no
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:43 we are not targeting the body of the jet
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:55 we are targeting what's slightly ahead of the jet
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:07 therefore by the time of the explosion lag, the jet will be in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:13 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:23 there is a glitch where u can get 3D view around the camera
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:30 I know
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:39 I already have a template for it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:50 compact 3 block wide guided missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:58 using motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:04:11 that missile was for ground targets though
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:08:31 I dont see a point in aircraft or vehicle carriers
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:08:49 unless plane crazy 2 have some form of sea to travel to a another piece of land on the map
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:09:43 I'm just dedicated to actual practical uses within warfare
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:11:09 I know, I built an entire mech from titanfall 2 and it has 0 purpose in warfare
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:11:38 see some titan running on the battlefield, shoot it, and it starts ascending to space
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:12:29 are they small
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:12:41 if they are u may be able to fit multiple of them in aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:12:46 then make them drones
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:13:26 probably more worth it to invest in anti air missile then storing it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:13:49 can they do much to ground units
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:14:09 multirole fighters can do devastating damage to ground units because they have space to hold extra missiles and bombs
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:14:42 so they can hold against dedicated AtA fighters?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:14:53 what is their destructive power status
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:15:40 can I see what they look like
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:16:03 if they are smaller than normal fighters do they have the space for such engine, or have space for much weapons
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:16:27 what
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:16:49 imagine shredder carrier
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:17:16 that one giant flying base that poops out shredder each time 1 dies
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:17:30 if base under attack shredder coems out like bees
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:17:40 shredder carrier
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:17:50 shredder hive
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:18:05 they are just legos for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:19:22 these can have some potential to do well against air but not sure if it has the space to carry anything against ground
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:19:28 probably dedicated to AtA
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:20:12 in actual plane crazy warfare, i dont think there would be tanks
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:20:25 everyone would just bring jets cuz it's convenient and the best vehicle to fight
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:20:50 not if u cant touch the jet in the first place
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:20:59 waot
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:00 wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:01 what
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:14 if the player is just wide open u can shoot it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:52 they get sling shotted? If out of fuel just kamikaze into opponent ships?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:22:08 not exactly, they are just magic planes afterall
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:22:43 isn't helicopter more suited to destroying the ground
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:23:18 yez
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:23:42 then you are just a weird plane with spinning wings on top
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:23:50 if u try to fight against dedicated figher jets
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:24:30 how would u plan to get out of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:24:58 what weapons might it be able to fit and how many
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:25:10 lol starts roasting
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:25:38 how do those bombs function
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:25:43 cluster? carpet?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:25:51 how many on each
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:26:02 isn't that heavy
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:26:19 I have a large bomber carrying 150 tnt cluster bomb that drops all in 1 go
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:27:09 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:28:10 if I have my bombs drop 2 times separately from the same bomb bay, some get stuck and explode my plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:28:20 and I only have 1 bomb bay
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:28:32 if i want 2 i need bigger plen 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:30:46 a flying block that poops out 150 tnt once stopped on top of a random ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:31:38 is there anything more explosive than 150 cluster bomb
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:31:44 in terms of explosion radius
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:32:09 i wanted to learn about missiles
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:32:39 I have an idea
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:32:57 have multiple alts, create and connect the power rangers mech
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:33:01 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:33:25 
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:35:48 how to defeat shredder
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:36:22 the person who invented shredder is pvp genius
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:24:47 yes it's obvious, do u think half block and block have same weight?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:25:06 no because one is simply smaller and have less volume
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:25:30 yes 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:26:35 is plane crazy 2 coming out
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:27:38 maybe considering the volume
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:16:50 is it just me or some people use ladder locking without knowing what connects to what and what is not supposed to be connected
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:17:44 that normal lock that most people use
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:18:02 motor locking stuff from upwards
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:18:16 there is methods for it
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:18:21 that's called ladder locking
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:18:30 depending on the pattern it has names for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:19:05 it's ladder lock cuz it goes up like ladder infinitely yet compacts into 1 space
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:19:16 they revert to grass map
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:19:18 from winter
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:18 just use conveyor engine, less weight for higher power
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:22:39 yes, u need to join plane crazy 5 times then on the 5th time, jump to void 10 times, when u completed it, there is 10% chance u get teleported to plane crazy 2, if you didn't get teleported, redo the following steps
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:22:53 just motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:06 no it's 6 😳
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:23 that's the most powerful one
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:38 conveyor engine is not hard to make compact
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:43 why
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:14 u literally need 2.5 block space for a conv engine
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:37 conveyor is monster in speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:51 then that's setting issues
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:00 you dont activate the piston for the conveyor engine to move
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:06 you activATE the conveyor to move
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:07 lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:37 then jsut motor lock simple, it's not hard
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:26:36 conveyor engine is literally 2 block stuff if u use piston, it's so easy to motor lock in
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:26:55 u do what u want, if it works it works lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:27:29 you can combine hover engine with conveyor for multispeed, activate conveyor for dogfights or something
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:27:45 wot
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:28:27 u can swap out the cylinder for trails, lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:28:55 hover engine can wobble if the pvp server is laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:29:34 where is the weight concentrated
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:11 motor lock wing panels into the jet's body too?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:31:02 i have a theory, if u use a lot of hover engine, will the amount of interactions cause lag
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:32:10 I had a really old blackbird, I swapped out the entire middle part for long hover engine and it lagged and start wobbling
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:33:37 funny thing, I don't make jets
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:34:26 like suddenly flying backwards at 1k speed?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:35:14 not a surprise

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:38:32 what if I don't
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:38:43 what if I don't
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:39:14 skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:39:40 yes make them walk
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:40:01 flying mechs with walkable legs are rare
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:41:23 motor 2 or control surface
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:41:45 if u good with motor lock make a compact motor 2 guided missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:42:06 i dont use control surface for guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 04:36:57 they are, motor 2 is just better
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 04:37:06 controlled surfaces are so small

general 2022-04-13 04:34:41 the deck is skill based
general 2022-04-13 04:35:10 you need to use and practise it a lot to use it well, so u will lose battles on first try
general 2022-04-13 04:36:10 just use mega knight, easy to use
general 2022-04-13 04:36:28 but also easy to counter
general 2022-04-13 04:37:29 you activated the sharingan
general 2022-04-13 04:38:09 u can now see ur opponent's future move and chakra flow

plane-crazy 2022-04-25 00:39:22 that youtube video more views than total human population
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:27:59 whenever I take too much dmg on my tank
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:28:04 my game freezes
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:28:06 and crash
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:34:56 like
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:35:06 just now, a jet fired 6 rockets all hit my sideskirt
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:35:12 then 2 seconds later the game completely freezes
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:36:07 it keeps happening
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:36:17 sustaining too much damage = crash
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:36:52 why
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:37:11 this hasn't happened to my other tank
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:37:22 my other tank can be completely destroyed and I can still play the game
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:37:31 on this tank, abit too much dmg = game completely frozen
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:44:51 is there anyway to fix this
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:54:34 when u spawn in give it some time
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:54:42 then u try testing again
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:54:47 dont press keys immediately after spawn
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:55:03 how about mine
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:55:19 every single time my new tank sustains some damage I completely frozen and crash
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:55:31 but my old tank take damage and doesnt crash
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:56:13 just shoot a few on plane then it will be working fine
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:56:44 yes
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:56:48 1-3 times
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:56:49 try it
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:56:56 if it doesn't work then there is real problem
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:57:40 this is my new tank, full of signs
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:57:45 whenever I sustain too much dmg
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:57:51 = game completely frozen and crash
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:57:57 my 1st theory are the signs
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:58:33 then im not sure
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:58:40 u can try your own theories and test them out
bug-reports 2022-05-02 01:58:44 im gonna do the same
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:05:31 the signs wasn't the problem
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:06:08 this is becoming a serious issue
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:06:15 get damaged and u completley get frozen
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:06:21 i dont know which block is the factor
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:06:50 oh
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:06:59 is there a way to mitigate or prevent it
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:07:14 or builds that are detailed and a lot of blocks will result liek that
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:07:24 ok
bug-reports 2022-05-02 02:07:35 im gonna try that
bug-reports 2022-05-02 03:03:48 problem solved
bug-reports 2022-05-02 03:04:02 I used locked piston as armour
bug-reports 2022-05-02 03:04:06 when the locked pistons get damaged

help 2022-05-08 14:20:54 does spinning the gun and firework increase their travel speed
help 2022-05-08 14:45:50 how about rockets
help 2022-05-08 14:46:11 according to fandom, for guns, they are: initial speed + 1500sps
help 2022-05-08 14:46:19 that is the gun speed
help 2022-05-08 14:46:22 so I thought if I spun it
help 2022-05-08 14:46:29 it would slightly increase in speed
help 2022-05-08 14:47:01 like
help 2022-05-08 14:47:03 ballistic
help 2022-05-08 14:47:11 fascinating topic
help 2022-05-08 14:47:13 things go up
help 2022-05-08 14:47:15 things go down
help 2022-05-08 14:47:20 guns
help 2022-05-08 14:47:23 they go up
help 2022-05-08 14:47:25 and go down
help 2022-05-08 14:47:33 depending on speed the go down take longer
help 2022-05-08 14:47:55 rotation is a speed
help 2022-05-08 14:48:07 if u attach your pilot seat to a rotating motor
help 2022-05-08 14:48:16 oh
help 2022-05-08 14:48:23 in this case
help 2022-05-08 14:48:30 my next tank design will be frekin op
help 2022-05-08 14:48:37 u can test it
help 2022-05-08 14:48:51 but not much boost
help 2022-05-08 14:48:59 you need a lot of motor to see a small change in speed
help 2022-05-08 14:49:17 and if ur barrel is spinnign it messes up ur motor 2 aiming
help 2022-05-08 14:49:59 that explains a guy with almost instantaneous high damage explosions
help 2022-05-08 14:50:09 I thought he was just spinning his rockets at very high speed
help 2022-05-08 14:50:15 but now I know it was the spinning fireworks
help 2022-05-08 14:54:30 oh
help 2022-05-08 14:54:32 fireworks are
help 2022-05-08 14:54:33 eh?
help 2022-05-08 14:55:04 do this: put 2 fireworks side by side but 1 is spinning did u do that
help 2022-05-08 14:55:16 hmmm
help 2022-05-08 14:55:28 but does 1 explode first
help 2022-05-08 14:55:50 can u screnshot the test build u did
help 2022-05-08 14:56:08 I had really high hopes for spinning fireworks
help 2022-05-08 14:56:24 <:BIG1:588443768806703124>
help 2022-05-08 14:58:17 is there a contraption that possibly makes a forward motor but not move on the spot <@587047177558163466>
help 2022-05-08 14:58:30 like motor rotation
help 2022-05-08 14:59:13 what if rotation + forward movement boosts it
help 2022-05-08 14:59:19 instead of just plain forward movement
help 2022-05-08 14:59:26 since real battle takes place in movement
help 2022-05-08 15:00:02 how about fireworks
help 2022-05-08 15:00:31 they could've at least added a legacy option to fireworks
help 2022-05-08 15:00:46 or maybe it was that way from the beginning
help 2022-05-08 15:01:35 <@587047177558163466> another question, does spinning a block (with motor) messes up incoming rocket tracking
help 2022-05-08 15:02:46 a lot of people have been implementing this
help 2022-05-08 15:02:53 spinning objects on their builds
help 2022-05-08 15:03:04 that makes the rocket go different direction out of confusion
help 2022-05-08 15:03:14 I'll probably test it myself soon
help 2022-05-08 15:06:29 ok thanks for the info
help 2022-05-08 15:06:36 btw u got an alt?
help 2022-05-08 15:06:40 roblox alt

plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:57:22 if your rocket hits them they will still go invisible
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:57:50 how many years have you played plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:58:05 and you don't know this common glitch
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:58:31 we have players from 2022 and still more informed than a 2019
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:59:19 it just means you've never opened up to other types of builds and pvp
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:59:26 you stuck to that one topic for a long time
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:59:38 which explains your amount of information regarding pvp
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 07:59:53 walking mechs are harder than flying mechs
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:00:04 single rotor helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:04:04 Real scaled aircraft carrier with working elevators and features that exist on an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:04:36 And is harder
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:04:58 Balancing and having monoaxial rotor helicopters work is harder than making a mech fly
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:05:19 I have a running BT-7274
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:06:31 Flying dolls with cutter sticks
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:06:53 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:07:12 Humans built planes because they saw birds fly
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:07:38 Yes, like charging in like a doll
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:08:16 Maneuverbility wise?
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:08:27 I've seen shredder go 3k
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:08:53 Jets rely on rockets and fireworks and guns
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:09:13 The high tier pvp jet turns 360 less than 1 second
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:09:51 Turn your mech 360 in less than 1 second
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:09:57 While going at 1k
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:10:41 Becoming humanoid shredder
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:11:16 Motor 2 with cutter is shredder
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:12:02 Are u suggesting to turn your mech into a new form of shredder
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:12:15 Flying swords exist
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:13:32 Make them walk
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:13:49 Make them run
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:14:23 Flying mechs only need a torso with arm
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:14:47 U don't need to walk if ur gonna fly
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:15:16 Extra feature to purely flex
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:15:36 But serves no purpose practically
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:16:07 Only in pcc
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:16:24 never seen one I don't follow up there
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:16:40 I told you
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:16:45 I have a running BT7274
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:17:18 which took 3 weeks
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:17:35 running and walking capable
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:17:45 What is that
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 08:18:05 I recognize fast rockets
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 05:02:41 
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 05:22:29 why
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 05:22:38 *to get roasted?*
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 05:26:45 i wasn't planning to put in creations
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 05:26:54 because it's not a serious build aimed at upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:56:23 what's the most downvoted build ever
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:59:23 im gonna achieve the most downvoted build in pcc
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:59:50 my current concept to get more downvotes:
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:00:15 1) cringy descriptions: "It works really well in pvp, probably the best pvp car ever"
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:00:38 2) make your build neon and over detailed that are just add ons to the original build
help 2022-05-13 09:37:58 Does fireworks go through tnt
help 2022-05-13 11:21:24 So it can clip through any block
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 00:26:48 how hard it needs to hit a surface to explode
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 00:27:07 if impact speed is 70, it needs to be travelling at 70 speed or above and hit a surface to explode
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 00:27:20 if below 70 speed and hit a surface, it wont explode
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 00:27:28 so you can adjust like that
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 10:02:59 slow
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 10:03:48 fatest possible speed in plane crazy is:
1) teleportation
2) inf
3) anything below inf
help 2022-05-21 14:42:06 what block is laggy?
help 2022-05-21 14:42:25 when I try to build something big like a battleship it gets laggy
help 2022-05-21 14:42:48 on my first battleship (intended for pvp) I play on about 10-15 fps
help 2022-05-21 14:42:55 so im rebuilding one
help 2022-05-21 14:43:28 make the turret turn
help 2022-05-21 14:44:15 then make it stuck but in an angle for picture
help 2022-05-21 14:44:41 where
help 2022-05-21 14:44:43 i mean the turret
help 2022-05-21 14:45:20 yes
help 2022-05-21 14:45:29 now make it can turn freely
help 2022-05-21 14:46:18 the wheel looks empty
help 2022-05-21 14:46:34 
help 2022-05-21 14:47:15 btw do u only do aesthetics?
help 2022-05-21 14:47:22 do u have any pvp intended tank
help 2022-05-21 14:47:50 you can call roscale a light tank for normal pvp sizes
help 2022-05-21 14:48:25 they are only good at upvote, not good at being used for fun
help 2022-05-21 14:48:45 they can be considered light tanks
help 2022-05-21 14:48:53 light tanks are meant to be maneuverable
help 2022-05-21 14:49:02 but can't get shot too much
help 2022-05-21 14:50:05 the smallest possible at least somewhat pvp effective tank is up to 5 block wide
help 2022-05-21 14:50:21 will the anti tank missile work or only for show
help 2022-05-21 14:51:25 i think i might make a real anti tank missile
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 16:39:15 use half block triangle then motor lock half wedge triangle, or if u can't, just use triangle wedge
the-dump 2022-05-24 11:39:57 Fertilizer

help 2022-05-25 12:50:54 trapdoor glitch
help 2022-05-25 12:51:17 when I use trap door on my build (maybe motor locked), it appears normal for me but for others the trap door is going crazy
help 2022-05-25 12:51:42 why
general 2022-05-25 12:58:28 do u guys think tea is british
general 2022-05-25 13:00:26 which one
general 2022-05-25 13:00:40 there is british, japanese and chinese tea
general 2022-05-25 13:00:51 I've never tried british tea before I think
help 2022-05-25 14:00:49 no
help 2022-05-25 14:01:32 The glitch can't be experienced client side but clearly visible to other players
help 2022-05-25 14:01:50 So u never know when it happens
help 2022-05-25 14:02:32 my theory is motor lock + trap door = glitch but not client side
help 2022-05-25 14:03:09 The trapdoor either is in odd angle or starts spinning crazy on other player screen
help 2022-05-28 03:46:40 how do i prevent my tank's turret from getting a bit stuck when turning
help 2022-05-28 03:46:48 I've used ice
help 2022-05-28 03:46:55 I limited friction using wedges
help 2022-05-28 03:47:05 there is nothing blocking its way when turning
help 2022-05-28 03:47:12 (it turns on motor 2)
help 2022-05-28 06:33:58 can't
help 2022-05-28 06:34:11 the motor 2 freaks out if it is on top of a piston in any way
help 2022-05-28 06:34:19 I don't even know why
help 2022-05-28 06:37:02 it gets worse by the second
help 2022-05-28 06:37:45 but I will attempt anyways
help 2022-05-28 06:38:37 yeah didn't work
help 2022-05-28 06:38:42 keeps randomly spinning endlessly
help 2022-05-28 06:40:23 ok
help 2022-05-28 06:40:26 wait
help 2022-05-28 06:40:29 can't
help 2022-05-28 06:40:36 the bottom of my turret are half blocks
help 2022-05-28 06:40:55 and is put down by 1 motor lock
help 2022-05-28 06:41:13 it's smooth most of the time and sometimes gets a bit stuck then smooth again
help 2022-05-28 06:43:05 no
help 2022-05-28 06:43:10 all engines are below the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:43:23 so the hull is flat
help 2022-05-28 06:43:45 
help 2022-05-28 06:43:47 red is the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:44:00 it is pretty much flat
help 2022-05-28 06:44:07 the half blocks are all ice
help 2022-05-28 06:44:18 and wedges
help 2022-05-28 06:46:17 yes
help 2022-05-28 06:46:26 it is hollow inside
help 2022-05-28 06:46:41 there is nothing inside other than the outside layer of half block shell
help 2022-05-28 06:46:51 for the part that touches the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:47:12 then it will be see through
help 2022-05-28 06:47:17 but likely removes the problem too
help 2022-05-28 06:48:21 ok I found the main problem
help 2022-05-28 06:48:30 it's not the friction between the turret and the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:48:49 it's the actually the friction that causes the barrel to elevate downwards clamping the turret and the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:48:57 so it's barrel's problem
help 2022-05-28 06:55:30 after another test
help 2022-05-28 06:55:33 that was the wrong problem
help 2022-05-28 06:55:41 the turret didn't clamp down at all it still got stuck
help 2022-05-28 06:56:18 no
help 2022-05-28 06:56:28 my new theory is collision
help 2022-05-28 06:56:47 motor locking things together sometimes some things are not fully into each other maybe causes small friction problem
help 2022-05-28 07:00:45 wasn't that either
help 2022-05-28 07:01:10 the most motor lock collision things were either my top mounted gun or rockets, their were both removed and the small stuck behaviour is still there
help 2022-05-28 07:02:28 that brings back to square 1
help 2022-05-28 07:02:35 friction between the half blocks and hull
help 2022-05-28 07:02:42 because removing the half blocks removed this problem
bug-reports 2022-05-28 12:29:54 probably have already been reported but worth a shot, I was in a random public pvp server where the guns were glitched, the red bullets didn't came out for everyone there was only the yellow bullet in the guns, so shooting someone makes their builds invisible and look damaged but infact, on other player's view there is nothing happening

general 2022-06-12 10:59:50 should pc2 have a digging mechanism

general 2022-06-12 11:00:06 or you have earth mover thing
general 2022-06-12 11:00:19 then make it last like 1 minute
general 2022-06-12 11:01:21 then 10 minutes
general 2022-06-12 11:01:35 you can pull the tactical positioning but last for 10 minutes
general 2022-06-12 11:02:58 wouldn't soft code make less lag
general 2022-06-12 11:03:26 how did rick make it so that loading was around 25x faster
general 2022-06-12 11:04:18 if pc2 have a 50 player server, and pvp servers would give everyone a hand held gun, we can have war games
general 2022-06-12 11:05:00 then you rain missile on him

plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:48:12 more super rockets
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:48:40 technically if you fell down first then you can't really be shot down
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:49:45 just make a tank and give it wings
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:50:25 you need the armour
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:50:29 not the firepower
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:50:41 it's never enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:51:09 I'll rephrase
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:51:15 you can have *more*
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:51:40 planes don't need a body
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 16:51:48 they only need wing and engine
general 2022-07-08 16:53:18 gliding will be added so assume that won't happen

plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:08:43 Camera is quite floaty too
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:09:32 If we are talking about combat conditions it's always better to have smaller and more
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:10:04 I'm going with small and more since I main pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:10:36 Less lag I think
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:11:22 What do u guys think of 1x1 guided missiles flying out of a 1x1 hole in a box
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:12:12 Worth the grind while pc2 is on the way
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:12:43 Disagree
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:13:07 Big builds aren't efficient anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:13:33 Inertia exists
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:14:04 If an object gets big, their mass increases way faster than the physical visible size
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:14:40 But it closely links
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:15:16 Meaning u need way more thrust the larger u are and is not proportional to increased size but mass
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:15:43 There is no ammo box
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:15:58 Then they are weak
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:16:15 Tiny cars simply means no armour
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:16:21 Easily gunned down
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:16:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:16:58 Otherwise people can just spam useless blocks at their plot just for higher weapon cap
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:17:50 This is plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:17:58 U need to abide to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:18:10 Small comes with much less durability
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:18:48 Do u understand that someone can spam thousands of blocks as the corner of their plot just to add 100 guns to a small car
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:19:43 wrong because if proper air physics
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:20:06 pc2 will have added gliding so shredder maneuver will be not easy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:20:38 Inertia is not air flow and air physics
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:21:06 Falsefalsefalse
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:21:18 Shredders work because u cant glide in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:21:57 In pc2, shredders can't stop midair and turn like that because once gliding is added they will most likely fail
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:22:15 Inertia is not air resistance
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:22:41 inertia exists, you can easily test this
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:23:02 Take a car and move forward then time the braking time in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:23:21 Afterwards, add 20 more blocks on the car then time the braking distance again
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:23:31 you can easily see inertia is in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:23:43 Air physics is crap that is why
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:23:52 not just shredders even jets can stop midair
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:24:03 simply because u cant glide in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:24:22 Crap air physics
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:24:29 In pc2, u can glide
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 11:24:49 So no, it's not inertia

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:07:51 I've only ever seen people good at killing surface vehicles with jets
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:07:55 not dogfights
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:14 it's like dogfight is the zone where they don't want to be in
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:43 can you dogfight
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:54 how fast is the plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:14 I only make conventional fighters
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:21 the dogfights now are like 2k speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:29 and they take up to 10 minutes to end
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:02 which is the same as trying to flip a coin until it lands vertically, same interpretation as trying to hit the enemy aircraft in 2k speed, kind of luck based
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:24 and then we have people who enjoys that and think it's skill based
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:58 where as infact, you can blatantly see the luck in every time someone who dogfights at 2k speed is just luck
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:11:10 "skill"

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:14:35 if you're going down the path of being able to kill is the key, it might as well be the 6th gens I suppose
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:14:38 design efficiency
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:14:56 actually 4th gens are great for design efficiency
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:16:16 preferred time line
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:16:20 of designs
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:16:39 I personally prefer conventional, modern or future concepts

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:09:36 plane crazy is revolved around innovation and one self's creation
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:09:43 That the core of the fun

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:10:56 then stop impersonating them
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:12:32 you can just ask to look at some cool builds in the community then we have this
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:13:22 welcome to the world of talking with you
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:13:43 I doubt hall of Fame will include pvp
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:14:11 yes, you are the main factor that shapes the community and you blame it's the community
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:15:00 have you ever heard of the domino effect
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:15:09 and the power of influence
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:15:31 <@456226577798135808> you're not the only one
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:16:14 yes, what should I refer to you instead
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:16:35 ok average pcc joe
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:16:40 sounds good
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:16:51 average pcc joe that says whitename
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:17:08 average response from an average pcc joe
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:17:20 yba can do better
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:17:33 pcc joe real
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:17:47 being average again
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:18:10 
events-chat 2022-09-02 17:35:03 everyone died and left
events-chat 2022-09-02 17:35:20 I was the last one there so I left
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 10:52:27 ships made for pvp are one of the most interesting things I've tried building in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 15:13:19 balls
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:10:42 they are
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:16:26 Musashi battleship yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:16:47 I make modern stuff for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:16:55 like a Destroyer ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:17:19 that's ww1
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:17:31 I'm making ww3 things
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:17:53 pretty sure the Arleigh Burke is gonna be in ww3
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:18:05 soon to be
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:18:21 and if it happens Arleigh Burke is in
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:18:34 ww3 is probably Nato vs the communist countries
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:19:11 self-inflicted emotional damage
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:03:37 pc2 should already be out what's the delay
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:04:28 when they say the release date they mean it's actually 3 months later than what they said or something
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:04:52 then Christmas of 2023
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:05:03 then new year of 2024
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:05:14 then summer of 2025
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:05:18 then cancellation
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:05:20 lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:07:31 did they get confident because they thought the game could be done at this rate
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:07:36 but encounter problems
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:08:00 then the problem isn't fixed by the date
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:08:04 further delays
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 05:48:30 https://tenor.com/view/cursed-gif-25039102
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 07:47:11 a circle has infinite sides, keep going
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:33:28 rick should increase the speed of gun bullet in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:33:55 because it's hard to shoot down plane with a bullet that drops down too fast
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:34:20 it's not even possible to graze a jet that fly by
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:34:39 yeah 0-600 speed is possible
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:34:57 but once the plane starts targeting you, when you grazed it you are already dead
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:35:24 no, it's possible at 10000 too
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:35:37 we're talking about rational and practical chances of killing a plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:36:00 so you're confident you can take down attack helicopters and jets with an anti-air vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:36:12 wanna try
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:36:22 exact
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:36:53 no one can beat jets with ground based anti-air
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:37:09 because there's no good options for it in a practical and realistic situation such as public pvp
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:37:38 a straight line
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:37:48 except there's number of them
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:37:58 I am
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:38:25 lol 300 speed is not gonna catch up to 1k speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:38:48 maximum gun is 10
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:39:06 also you're not going to slice a jet that's flying by
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:39:22 they do maneuvers to the point you can't predict them without radar systems
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:39:40 and if the jet starts going for you, you are already dead
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:40:05 there's no practical anti-air solutions as ground vehicles in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:40:33 it's easy to shoot down random planes slower than 600 speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:40:45 but even then would still take more than 5 minutes of constant shooting
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:40:57 that's why I suggested higher bullet speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:41:26 plane users should not be invincible
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:41:33 there's all there is to it
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:41:59 yes that's what I'm talking about and we have people going like <@654091171433283637> "skill issue"
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:42:27 yes it's impossible, you'll die before you get a graze
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:42:50 and if you move while shooting you're going to shoot off course and not even get close to the jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:43:17 but when you can barely hit them the battle ain't going anywhere, especially for aircrafts in dogfight or anti air operations
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:44:14 rick didn't say anything about changing the stats of the pvp weapons other than cutter new model
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:44:47 in general I believe that rockets and guns should have a higher base speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:44:59 but a nerfed velocity add on speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:45:16 such as only registering 70% of your velocity + the weapon's base speed or something like that
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:45:22 but the base speed is higher, I think that's more balanced
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:46:02 bullet drop is not proportionate to the map size, it's something to do with gravity or bullet velocity
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:46:32 if so, what
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:47:16 what's your reliable solution to ground based anti-air
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:48:15 for anti-air operations, you need both long range and high firing speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:48:23 and a radar system for leadshot
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:48:32 even so would not garuantee a hit
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:49:07 because machines can't predict the future and what the player will do in terms of maneuvers, only the math calculated forward trajectory
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:49:25 but if that thing is added in plane crazy aircrafts will have a higher chance of being shot down
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:49:57 at least all you have to do is click and pressure's on the pilot
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:50:10 rick is already doing it
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:51:03 it's easier to shoot down shredders than shoot down jets I wonder how many even realise that
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:51:42 then again, you have 8k speed dogfighters
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:52:02 at least it's a large moving 8k speed ball making it more shoot-down-able
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:52:35 fighter jets are more dangerous than shredders
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:53:16 it takes a good pilot to be accurate on wasd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:53:25 but it doesn't take a good pilot to be invincible in a jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:54:33 in general, fighter jets are realistically the nearest thing to invincibility right now
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:55:12 we can talk about the problem all day but we need a solution
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:55:40 wobble is very easy to fix
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:55:50 the problem is how do u reliably take down jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:56:19 how do you deliver them.
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:56:38 how will you hit them.
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:57:09 have you tried to kill a random fast and super maneuverable jet in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:57:38 because you're gonna be chasing it for 10 minutes and there won't be a guarantee that you will even graze that jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:57:56 same case for fighter jets fighting another one of it's own kind
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:58:35 a lot of dogfighting leagues and limited speed or some have rules like "no running away have to keep fighting" just to make each jet not invincible
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:59:23 with that out of the way, how are you going to take down a jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:59:31 realistically, you can't
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 10:59:46 that's why the in-game pvp needs some work
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:01:29 the last rework is something about rocket tracking fix
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:02:05 you can add as many weapon as you like, without a proper way of delivering it you can't shoot down the jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:03:38 my idea is to add a category of blocks like a network system so there's a generated HUD that shows you a circle of where to shoot at, auto predicting
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:03:57 but you need to add all of these blocks and link them together to make this like a radar system
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:04:20 and if just 1 block within the whole network gets destroyed you will no longer have the HUD
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:04:24 It's an idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:04:43 it is
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:05:00 Prototode have done it, but with hacks and own coding insert of course
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:06:19 warship
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:06:29 with a Vertical Launch System
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:06:35 that can launch out missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:06:50 make the missile super compact so u can store a lot of them on the ship
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:17:50 6969 next target
general 2022-10-05 07:35:17 how did u make the cone
general 2022-10-05 07:35:44 I don't remember plane crazy having one
general 2022-10-05 07:36:05 stfu
general 2022-10-06 08:25:09 my cat is brown
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 08:27:20 roads, street racing
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 08:28:01 imagine some ballistic missile carrier vehicle just hiding in the race track with the track's raised walls covering him so no one can reach him and he be nuking the server while there
the-dump 2022-10-06 08:30:10 you mean the "*dodges*" expert
general 2022-10-15 07:41:37 Sharkbite 2 is releasing earlier than Plane crazy 2

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:46:19 animal cruelty
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:47:57 those type of bugs are easy to kill
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:48:03 the omni-bugs are the real deal
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:48:26 easily acronym for everything actually
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:48:30 Anti Ship System
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:48:32 Anti Surface System
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:48:44 Anti Submarine System
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:49:22 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-shredder-gif-24221292
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:49:27 but 30k speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:49:58 Omni-shredder is the level after shredder ball
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:50:17 not when it is made out of tnt and moves at 30k speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:50:33 you sure
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:50:45 I'm pretty sure you can't even touch me if I fly my jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:12 not really, it's a problem for you
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:29 if it moves at 30k speed, the cutters will just phase through and kill you
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:39 and you can never touch it
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:52 it doensnt even take a blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:00 infact it's more effective without the blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:05 because it will fling u extremely far
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:49 because that's the owner of the shredder community
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:16 fighter jets post more of a threat actually
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:25 owner of the shredder community
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:39 **owner of the shredder community**
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:49 depends on which one
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:15 you'll be ruined if you try actually
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:18 you can't even play the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:26 how fast is 'speedy'
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:50 1k+ is shit
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:10 meta shredder moves at 50k
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:23 at 1k is barely enough
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:49 running away from a shredder is a joke
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:04 fighter jets are easily the hardest things to hit in the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:18 m2 based controls such as omni meta shredders
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:44 they are better but they can't kill meta shredders because both are those type of untouchable aircrafts
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:59 you dont need a wide screen lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:57:11 you can aim while simultaneously turning your cam
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:57:26 the ones he killed are basic trash
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:58:06 it's not fixed, you have throttle control
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:58:29 there are different types of shredder, every single type of shredder is basic trash except for 1 type and im talking about that one
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:59:09 fighter jet and shredder can't kill each other provided both are at the highest level
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:59:20 "yeh if ur gsolo u can kill them ez"
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:59:38 wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:59:49 they have all of them
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:59:57 m2 is as precise as your mouse
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:09 you thrusters are directly facing your mouse as fast and precise as a turret, now attach weapons
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:55 they don't
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:59 it's facing their mouse
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:02:18 every single moment
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:02:41 their wing panels have drag with the air for their m2 to face the mouse midair
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:02:54 that's what you like to think
general 2022-10-17 14:04:23 pro gamer
general 2022-10-18 14:14:36 what do u guys think of macro in plane crazy
general 2022-10-18 14:15:18 so what do u do with macro
general 2022-10-18 14:15:41 I do that without macro
general 2022-10-18 14:16:29 apparently there is a macro that allows a 'fire and forget' missile to exist
general 2022-10-18 14:16:59 wdym by nope
general 2022-10-18 14:17:18 someone is able to achieve it but it's a highly classified / top secret info
general 2022-10-18 14:17:35 he claimed it used macro
general 2022-10-18 14:17:53 how would you know that though
general 2022-10-18 14:18:06 wdym
general 2022-10-18 14:18:18 he claims it works
general 2022-10-18 14:18:29 he macro'd it to 'fire and forget'
general 2022-10-18 14:19:22 then do u know of any alternatives that can do fire and forget
general 2022-10-18 14:19:45 yes
general 2022-10-18 14:20:06 not auto tracking without help, of course following your mouse but you dont need to touch the mouse
general 2022-10-18 14:22:27 what if you could create a loop that if the macro detects 'something' it begins that loop of 'something' until the 'something' is no longer there
general 2022-10-18 14:23:14 btw, is it possible to create any visual object on your screen with macro
general 2022-10-18 14:23:37 such as a cube on your screen with macro
general 2022-10-18 14:23:51 or even a circle on your screen
general 2022-10-18 14:23:54 is that a thing
general 2022-10-18 14:24:04 is there an app that can do this
general 2022-10-18 14:24:12 make a random circle on your screen
general 2022-10-18 14:24:28 it's like how bonzi buddy puts a monkey on your screen
general 2022-10-18 14:24:34 but you manually put a circle
general 2022-10-18 14:25:57 I was thinking of the concept of manually putting your own HUD
general 2022-10-18 14:26:03 like a lag shot aiming system
general 2022-10-18 14:26:21 so if you aim anywhere, you can see a circle of where the bullet actually goes
general 2022-10-18 14:26:40 then based on that you will aim on the opponent
general 2022-10-18 14:28:14 you can observe it on your screen
general 2022-10-18 14:29:10 just ask rick how many studs does it travel before disappear
general 2022-10-18 14:36:22 why is creations full of downvotes and weird builds now
general 2022-10-18 14:37:36 cruise missiles
general 2022-10-18 14:37:41 fly under the radar and hit the target
general 2022-10-18 14:37:57 no point if they dont detect anything
general 2022-10-18 14:38:38 im talking about real life
general 2022-10-18 14:38:49 cruise missiles fly so low that radars can't detect it
general 2022-10-18 14:39:05 cruise missiles fly lower than the radar detection
general 2022-10-18 14:39:49 and the curve along with the surface
general 2022-10-18 14:39:57 tho it's slower than most missiles
general 2022-10-18 14:40:27 radar detection is still higher than a cruise missile's flight path
general 2022-10-18 14:40:45 ah yes with their skilled eyes
general 2022-10-18 14:42:33 "it is flying at approximately 800 kilometer per hour, we have 4.5 seconds to react, permission to engage sir"
general 2022-10-18 14:42:59 let's say 1 second to react from all the talking

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:40:43 what did u watch
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:40:45 lol
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:40:45 azur lane?
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:41:47 I watch anime because I enjoy the intellectual entertainment
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:42:13 but they don't give me the feels of an anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:42:26 which one
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:42:41 who looks at ghosts and thought they become your combat buddies
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:43:03 who would thought a modern military would suddenly meet ancient roman
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:43:36 who would thought human colonised the galaxy and is having wars over power using space mechs
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:43:46 those are the reasons why I watch anime it's interesting
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:43:58 attack on titan
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:44:15 I can't stop having goosebumps with attack on titan
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:44:34 no movie gives me the feel I get from animes
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:29 I watched anime and I learned life philosophies
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:37 and even how to make nitroglycerin
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:44 which is basically dynamite
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:54 lol they dont teach u anything
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:03 some anime actually teaches
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:10 go try, you can't
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:26 it teaches hell ton you just landed on the wrong one for your first
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:34 but I can because of anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:47:01 the anime deliberately warned the viewers all ingredients and crafts within the anime is real and do not attempt every episode, watch Dr Stones
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:47:17 how old are you
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:47:23 16
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:47:35 tell me which anime you watched first
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:48:15 his opinion is that anime is trash and anyone who watches it is underaged
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:48:36 the fuck
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:49:02 isn't it algebra
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:49:09 such as parabolas or straight lines
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:49:40 I learned all of this in a different language so I don't even know the names of these maths
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:50:29 demon slayer mugen train
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:50:45 jujutsu kaisen 0
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:51:13 dragon ball super: broly
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:51:29 no
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:51:45 but it is something that I really enjoy even after I finished it
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:22 that's not the point
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:28 not rewatching it
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:46 you enjoy it because you watched the anime and you are still able to think about it and enjoy it as much as when u watched it
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:35 but they are random stuff, imagine you get that but in a whole series, packs the punch much higher
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:45 I don't have a mic
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:55 give me math questions
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:54:22 I meant numerical
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:54:33 I don't know these definitions because English was not my first language
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:39 not at all
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:49 we're not talking about the scenes, but sure they are really cool as well
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:59 it's not always about the fighting
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:56:25 anime like 'Your Lie in April' is actually very good because of the impact it lands on you after you finished the anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:56:32 and there is absolutely no fighting
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:57:11 and movies like 'silent voice' is actually somewhat interesting and impactful
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:57:25 the further you go down into the movie the more things makes sense
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:58:47 try Eighty Six
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:59:11 it's about far in the future as well
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:59:38 or animes like 'Love is War', intense psychological warfare and intellect
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:00:26 Death Note is also one of those intellectual typed anime, outsmarting outsmart
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:01:23 'classroom of elite' is just speechlessly genius, no idea how the director pulls these stuff off
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:02:04 but it hits different in anime compared to movie that's undescribable in words for me
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:04:13 anime be like:
main character gives himself amnesia on purpose to dodge the intense interrogation and somehow with enough pre-instructions to reverse the effect
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:05:12 except that's just the base
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:05:43 there are anime directiors that directs a few animes
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:06:27 I wouldn't say all of them are as well but the ones I chose to watch are good for me
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:08:00 I think Saiki is better
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:08:52 I can't take the art style lol
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:11:20 I already watched interstellar btw
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:11:52 but I find the anime impact better
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:13:20 sci-fi space
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:13:28 bro went into a blackhole

plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:34:35 Brown-Séquard syndrome
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:35:34 Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare spinal disorder that results from an injury to one side of the spinal cord in which the spinal cord is damaged but is not severed completely. It is usually caused by an injury to the spine in the region of the neck or back. In many cases, affected individuals have received some type of puncture wound in the neck or in the back that damages the spine and causes symptoms to appear.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:36:02 Characteristically, the affected person loses the sense of touch, vibrations and/or position in three dimensions below the level of the injury (hemiparalysis or asymmetric paresis). The sensory loss is particularly strong on the same side (ipsilateral) as the injury to the spine. These sensations are accompanied by a loss of the sense of pain and of temperature (hypalgesia) on the side of the body opposite (contralateral) to the side at which the injury was sustained.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:36:20 Symptoms of Brown-Séquard syndrome usually appear after an affected individual experiences a trauma to the neck or back. First symptoms are usually loss of the sensations of pain and temperature, often below the area of the trauma. There may also be loss of bladder and bowel control. Weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of muscles in the affected area may occur. Paralysis on the same side as that of the wound often occurs. Paralysis may be permanent if diagnosis is delayed. Individuals with this syndrome have a good chance of recovering a large measure of function. More than 90% of affected individuals recover bladder and bowel control, and the ability to walk. Most affected individuals regain some strength in their legs and most will regain functional walking ability.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:36:31 This syndrome is often a consequence of a traumatic injury by a knife or gunshot to the spine or neck. In many cases, however, it is caused by, or is the result of, other spinal disorders such as cervical spondylosis, arachnoid cyst or epidural hematomas. Brown-Séquard syndrome may also accompany bacterial or viral infections. Blunt traumas, such as occur in a fall or automobile accident, on rare occasions may be the cause of the Brown-Séquard syndrome.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:36:40 The medical literature cites, as causing or being associated with BSS, the following conditions: lateral curvature of the spine (kyphosis), Chiari I malformation, methamphetamine injection in the neck, multiple sclerosis, spinal epidural hematoma, intramedullary spinal cord tumor, and myeloschisis. Among the infectious or inflammatory causes cited are: meningitis, empyema, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, myelitis, and tuberculosis.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:36:50 Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 500 cases have been reported to date. The incidence of Brown-Séquard syndrome has been estimated to be 2% of all traumatic spinal cord injuries. The annual incidence of all forms of spinal cord injury is estimated to be 30-40 per 1,000,000 people.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:37:05 Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Brown-Séquard Syndrome. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis: Motor Neuron Disease is a degeneration of motor neurons. Motor neurons control the behavior of muscles. Motor Neuron Disease may affect the upper motor neurons, which control the signals from the brain to the spinal cord, or the lower motor neurons which lead from the spinal cord to the muscles of the body. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Motor Neuron Disease” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:37:22 Progressive Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a slowly progressive Motor Neuron Disease. Muscle weakness and wasting may begin in the hands and eventually affect the arms, shoulders, legs, and the rest of the body. Muscle twitching may occur in the limbs and tongue. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Motor Neuron Disease” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Primary Lateral Sclerosis affects adults. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the upper motor neurons. Difficulty in speech and swallowing, semi or complete paralysis of the legs and/or arms, and muscle twitching and spasticity may occur. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Motor Neuron Disease” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:37:30 Stroke is one of the most common neurological conditions affecting the central nervous system. Stroke is caused by a blockage of blood flow to part of the brain. The may happen because of a blood clot or because of the bursting of an aneurysm in the brain.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:37:45 **There is no specific treatment for individuals with Brown-Séquard syndrome. In most instances, treatment focuses on the underlying cause of the disorder. Treatment may involve drugs that control muscle symptoms, and there is some dispute as to whether high-dose steroid administration is effective.**
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:37:54 Devices that help an affected individual continue daily activities such as braces, hand splits, limb supports, or a wheelchair are important. Various other aids may be necessary if the patient has difficulty breathing or swallowing. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:38:20 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is sponsoring a Phase II and Phase III clinical trial designed to improve walking ability after spinal cord injury. Patients with Brown-Sequard syndrome may be eligible to participate in the study. It is well known that incomplete spinal cord injury often makes walking very difficult. A group of physical therapists are trying to determine the effect of treadmill speed on spinal cord function and walking performance.
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 02:38:43 Recently, evidence has been building to contradict the conventional wisdom that recovery of nerve function following spinal cord injury was not possible. It has been shown that nerve circuits (neuronal circuits) may reorganize by strengthening previously inactive connections and circuits. Sensory information related to movement is used to improve treadmill and overground walking.

plane-crazy 2023-02-21 07:58:31 does anyone wanna 1v1 me in tank pvp, rules are 200 speed, 2 fireworks, 4 rockets and 8 guns
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:18:57 it is fun if you're in the right place
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:19:06 I can introduce you
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:19:37 the pcmg community
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:19:49 Plane Crazy Military Groups
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:20:04 battles are regulated with fair rules yet not too strict
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:20:25 there are limitations on tanks to prevent lag or op things
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:20:39 I only do ground pvp and naval pvp though
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:20:46 there are also air pvp rules
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:21:32 no, vehicle must look like a plane or is disqualified
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:03 here's how the battles work
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:14 they are split into 3 sections
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:18 tank vs tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:22 air vs air
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:27 naval vs naval
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:29 no crossing
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:40 no air vs tank stuff
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:22:58 no rule I know says no so it is allowed
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:23:06 but it's highly unrecommended
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:23:36 because the speed limit for most of the ground battles are set to 200
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:23:48 and tracks can't exactly go that fast making them living targets
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:24:11 unless it is giant
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:24:20 if it is too big, you will be too easy of a target as well
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:24:46 Cosmetic comes after function
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:24:54 how many blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:24:57 and top speed
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:25:24 I need numbers
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:25:30 top speed and block width
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:25:51 What's that
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:26:20 it's easy to cheat
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:26:24 do cosmetic first
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:26:36 because function can be added using power of infinite motor locks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:26:52 Jamming an indefinite amount of blocks into a single space
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:29:01 how about size
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:29:04 how many blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:29:22 mechs vs mechs is so minor they have a private community dedicated for it and is not recognised anywhere else
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:30:07 cross terrain war is not allowed
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:30:21 unless it is the realistic league, if not then it will not be recognised anywhere else
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:30:38 because realistic league have quite specific limitations on all vehicles making combined arms fair
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:31:26 that also means if you play an attack aircraft, you cannot run 10 km away and dive and repeat, you can be called out by the ref
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:31:52 then put a long block with black and white inbetweens and see how many blocks it is after parking infront of that measuring beam
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:32:47 I don't need length and height
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:32:49 I only need width
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:33:49 <@726014272731217991> join me I'll check for you
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:34:02 I'll also combat test you and tell u what u'll need before u enter the world of pvp (on discord)
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:34:29 oh
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:34:43 the largest would also be 9-10, mine is 7-8
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:34:59 in width
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:35:03 I need width not length
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:35:16 length and height don't matter
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:35:20 width tells the real size
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:35:34 because the player will automatically proportionate the length and height according to width
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:35:50 "because the player will automatically proportionate the length and height according to width" - girl
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:36:42 the 2 things you should change would be tracks and width, that's pretty much it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:36:48 if u change those your tank will improve significantly
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:36:58 rockets are merely secondaries
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:05 make a new tank or smthing
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:18 you'll want to test it against a real tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:23 and u will see the problem
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:34 easy
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:36 explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:37:44 there's only 150 of them use carefully
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:08 12 block wide tanks can't be completely covered by explosive blocks as they are too big for just 150 of these
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:20 you don't know?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:26 you must still be in the primitive era
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:34 explosive block cannot be damaged
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:43 done
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:44 now use it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:38:58 it cannot be damaged by anything other than lava and explosive block itself
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:39:04 no
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:39:12 bullets get stopped in its track
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:39:29 if u see your enemy getting holes after shooting them, they don't actually have those holes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:39:43 they are diappearing because your yellow bullets hit them and causing a 'ghosting' effect, a glict
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:39:54 the red bullet does the real damage
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:40:02 so when they ghost, you don't know if they are actually damaged that badly or they are completely fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:40:52 I should answer that again, yes bullets cannot pass through tnt
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:00 but
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:09 explosion radius from rockets and fireworks can damage things behind it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:28 that's the engineering challenge
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:35 technology
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:42 about making better solutions and better tanks as you go
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:41:48 that's the beauty of tank pvp
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:42:14 just make a new tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:42:20 but this time actually use explosive blocks instead of normal block
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:42:33 but disable them before u use them so u dont blow yourself up
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:43:02 what vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:43:38 I only make military related vehicles and actual pvp capability to participate in battles and wars between plane crazy groups

general 2023-03-03 15:37:31 my English homework sounds wrong without context
general 2023-03-03 15:37:48 my english homework: *The lights fade like a beautiful sunset. Saliva moisturised my face like jam on bread. The moist texture gives me shivers. I could feel the slither from the tongue more and more, travelling from my waist, all the way to my face. Lights eventually went out. The feeling of being crushed while being engulfed in saliva. Perhaps it did feel like being massaged, uncomfortably. Maybe everything at this point was uncomfortable after all.*
general 2023-03-03 15:38:45 tell me when u want the context
general 2023-03-03 15:39:13 it's more innocent than u think
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 08:07:23 what the hell
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 08:07:25 motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 08:07:30 got a lot weaker
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:17:32 my tanks are fine from the m2 breaking
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:17:48 but my ship can no longer combat due to all my missiles and torpedoes dying
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:18:06 tanks and spaceships are the way to go now until rick does something
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:18:28 default control surface
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:18:32 the ingame control surface
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:19:11 significantly weaker now
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:19:27 motor 2 also got weaker
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:19:56 it gets wobbly faster now
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:20:01 due to being weaker
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 12:20:38 time to invest into light tanks
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 15:35:34 can rick fix it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 15:35:37 does he know
general 2023-04-09 14:15:06 is the m2 bug fixed yet
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 14:15:07 is the m2 bug fixed yet
general 2023-04-09 14:15:50 he is cutely pulling the nerf gun's trigger while aiming at his chin for a chin massage
general 2023-04-09 14:16:28 and if he deletes it then u can get a warn
general 2023-04-09 14:17:05 wow he is using grammar
general 2023-04-10 08:26:47 is the m2 bug still not fixed
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 08:26:50 is the m2 bug still not fixed
general 2023-04-10 08:27:46 does anyone understand the cause of the m2 being weak
general 2023-04-10 08:28:46 it was fixed last time but it came back, why no one noticing
bug-reports 2023-04-10 08:30:37 why is the m2 bug back
bug-reports 2023-04-10 08:30:42 m2 became weak again
help 2023-04-28 07:50:07 **what does the super strength option in magnet even do**
help 2023-04-28 07:51:39 **does anyone even have a clue**
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 07:53:49 what does the super strength in magnet even do
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 07:53:59 till this day I don't even know what it does
general 2023-04-28 07:54:37 does anyone use magnets in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 07:57:06 is there a difference, if so what is it
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 07:57:12 does it get stronger or what
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 07:59:13 so its attracting range gets further?
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 08:01:47 I've heard this somewhere, magnets without super strength also has the same strength
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 08:01:55 which makes me question what does it do
creations-chat 2023-04-28 08:02:38 do u know what do the super strength option do in magnets
help 2023-04-28 08:06:35 it's just illogical to think that super strength makes it stronger if u already have a strength bar u can set
help 2023-04-28 08:06:47 I've also heard somewhere that it doesnt make it much stronger
help 2023-04-28 08:07:16 I am not starting a petition

help 2023-04-28 08:07:35 would he answer

help 2023-04-28 08:17:06 the magnet is weaker with super strength on
help 2023-04-28 08:17:39 any explanations
help 2023-04-28 08:17:50 you should know because you are a pro non-white name right
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 08:18:41 the magnet is actually weaker with super strength on
help 2023-04-28 08:37:41 wow ur so good
help 2023-04-28 08:37:48 but what u said earlier is false
help 2023-04-28 08:37:49 lol
help 2023-04-28 08:38:00 super strength "english" yeah about that it actually makes the magnet weaker
help 2023-04-28 08:38:15 test it yourself
help 2023-04-28 08:38:16 🕋
help 2023-04-28 08:39:01 u don't need to know it to help me test it

help 2023-05-11 10:45:27 does anyone know how to make magnet engines accelerate and cap at a desired speed instead of it just accelerating forever
help 2023-05-11 11:00:14 but it has to be magnet
help 2023-05-11 11:00:19 someone has achieved it
help 2023-05-11 11:00:34 tho he doesn't play anymore and refuses to talk about plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:37:19 Actually, I changed to winter wheel in the latest modification, it now requires winter wheel to maintain its current steering capability

I will post latest performance and design soon
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:40:13 it's not visible probably due to video quality but there is a trail connecting it
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:45:02 I can add textblocks with black square emoji to make it more visible
creations-chat 2023-05-16 06:27:14 exhaust colour changed

btw it's fully capable of circuit racing if someone has a build that loads the circuit barriers
creations-chat 2023-05-16 06:30:01 stabilisers which are responsible for helping the bike lean and not fall over and tumble like any average bike if they tried to lean, this also really helps it with maneuvering for circuit typed racing
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:06:46 it can off road but it's not supposed to as a track racing bike, it can cross terrain at around 150 speed and be stable (uses motor 2 suspensions)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:29:06 which one
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:32:33 will he get warned
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:19:55 ok tell me this: is it possible to consciously control whether blood is allowed to enter ur pp
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:20:32 being able to consciously suppress a wood
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:20:58 what if u trained to be able to
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:21:32 I think u can somewhat control this if u have a very strong mind
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:21:42 yes it's all about imagination
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:22:22 then suppress it
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 01:22:27 Strong men
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 03:03:45 I tried and it worked
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 03:12:39 I did it using my brain
help 2023-05-17 16:27:20 are there any plane crazy engineers here that has experience with magnet engines
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:28:26 anyone really experienced with magnet engines?
help 2023-05-17 16:37:48 yes but that is a really trash model
help 2023-05-17 16:39:32 motor lock is obsolete idiot <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2023-05-17 16:39:54 top tier pvp engineering has very little motor locking by now, it uses offset locking
help 2023-05-17 16:40:17 offset locking does what motor locking can do but motor locking can't do what offset locking can

help 2023-05-17 16:40:49 performance is not liked here, so just say engineering instead
help 2023-05-18 00:21:48 the functions I side are not aircrafts
help 2023-05-18 00:22:23 I seek functions with practicality
help 2023-05-18 00:22:59 for example, a motor 2 suspension chassis system made for pvp tanks
help 2023-05-18 00:23:15 7 blocks wide pvp tanks, I don't enjoy oversized
help 2023-05-18 03:07:02 im not interested in over sized suspensions, they don't have any use other than for show
help 2023-05-18 03:07:14 my motor 2 suspension is being used in pvp tanks
help 2023-05-18 03:07:26 does he have a yt video showcase?

help 2023-05-18 03:08:07 where can I see his suspension
help 2023-05-18 03:14:42 does anyone know what does the magnet do if u turn off the 'lose parts only'
help 2023-05-18 03:15:07 what will trigger its attraction after that
help 2023-05-18 05:54:47 it apparently stopped attracting loose parts

general 2023-05-18 15:33:00 I hope, people are losing hope
general 2023-05-18 15:33:38 Flightpoint is stealing plane crazy players slowly but surely
general 2023-05-18 15:34:00 that game is receiving updates regularly
general 2023-05-18 15:34:18 will be fixed before pc2 comes out I bet
general 2023-05-18 15:34:49 it's getting there, just slowly as the updates come rolling out making the game better and better
general 2023-05-18 15:39:46 **Someone posted something that isn't from clash of clans**

plane-crazy 2023-07-02 05:58:38 what is this stability fixed update
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:38:57 u can land with half a wing
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:39:07 nothing surprising, just plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:39:29 cut off ur right wing and u can still fly and land
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:39:47 u need some form of lift
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:40:00 but depending on ur definition of landing
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:40:06 u can land with nothing
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:40:54 I heard the new updates broke the pvp rockets and hindered custom missile performances
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:42:51 u have wings
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:42:59 ur tail wings
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:43:23 it does
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:43:28 delete it and try again
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:44:05 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:44:09 now remove all the remaining wing panels if u have any left
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:44:17 completely 0 wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:44:26 gen 69 jets be like
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:45:36 reject aircraft, become giant missile
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:48:52 #
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:49:19 then join our pvp league
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:49:30 shredder-free environment
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:50:30 shredder is not even classified as one of the 4 vehicles allowed in league battles
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:50:46 which are naval, ground, aerial and space vehicles
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:51:41 plus if u attempt to use a shredder in a league battle, you would just get banned and lose the battle immediately due to breaking the rules
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:52:25 missile is not classified as a vehicle, it's a weapon u can put on a vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:52:56 if u use shredder probably but if u break general rules like overspeeding then u will just lose that one battle, not ban
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 05:53:21 yes

bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:41 
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:48 I tried moving the entire build but the center of the build is
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:55 not on my plot
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:08 he's going to sleep
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:14 he will fix tomorrow or something
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:20 tbh wouldn't be bothered if he didn't
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:33 I would rather he do pc2
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:49 oh wait
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:55 if u put a block on top of any block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:05:01 u disconnect
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:05:02 lol
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:17 o nvm it's cylinders and wedges for now
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:34 and half blocks
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:45 wedge, cylinders, half blocks, balls, pontoons
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:07:19 they give u error code 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:03:39 are you sure it isn't center of weight issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:18 im gonna test my ship
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:55 no issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:59 no issue with pontoons
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:05 my ship is still upright
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:16 your center of weight is above your floating point so you are flipping over
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:24 you need to lower your center of weight
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:07:51 hold on
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:01 <@217336009455566848> pontoons now float infinitely even out of water, making you ascend
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:18 oh wait
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:24 pontoons float on water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:28 but it doesn't stop floating
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:34 it keeps going up even after out of water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:21 it didn't affect my military grade ship with a better stability, but civillian grade ships will now flip
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:34 because pontoons will infinitely float
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:35 new bug
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:53 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:11:39 guys there is a new bug: pontoons float infinitely even after going out of water
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:12:19 it happens after it touches water
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:12:44 before touching water, all normal
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:18:36 pontoons are also broken
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:23:00 lag, just wait
general 2023-07-07 07:26:02 pontoon is still broken pls fix
general 2023-07-07 07:26:27 Japan is having issues with birth rate so expect Japan to drop out of top 3 soon
general 2023-07-07 07:26:49 nah, quite a few notable bugs happened after the update dropped
general 2023-07-07 07:27:46 lol all the mods are offline
general 2023-07-07 07:28:03 if u make flightpoint more pvp'able I'll consider
general 2023-07-07 07:29:21 also, the ability to make blocks invisible and turn off collision is essentially cheating in engineering
general 2023-07-07 07:29:38 no fun that way

general 2023-07-07 07:45:57 just ask them if u have
general 2023-07-07 07:46:41 ok ask all of them
general 2023-07-07 07:46:44 at the same time
general 2023-07-07 07:47:05 except for pontoons apparently
general 2023-07-07 07:47:25 damn it I should've let rick know to let cam lock stay
general 2023-07-07 07:48:43 cam lock is pretty much a cheating tech for pvp anyway, but if I could choose I would want it to stay
general 2023-07-07 07:51:10 flightpoint
**disregard**
bug-reports 2023-07-07 11:54:57 guns are phasing through blocks, they aren't stopping when hitting one block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:20 guns are damaging every block in line at the same time, phasing through all of them
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:37 this isn't supposed to happen, as guns were previously stopped by one block and damages one at a time
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:57 along with this, pontoons now infinitely float upwards once touching water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:18:10 these are the 2 notable bugs that needs to be fixed after this new update
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:37:11 So far I've found that half block, wedge, cylinder and pontoons stacked upwards causes error 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:37:42 also going to mention about the gun bug, it phases through and damaged everything instead of stopping at the initial block it hits
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:41:02 a lot of new bugs after that performance update apparently
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:44:42 u don't really need to, it's quite easy to explain
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:46:09 u can put the block on any side of the following blocks: half block, wedge, cylinder and pontoon, except for the top of it. If you try to place another block on top of them, u wouldn't be able to as if something is already there, and if u do place it, which it will push it 1 block away sideways from the top of the block, then u get kicked
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:51:06 wait I'll try
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:51:51 half block is fixed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:52:04 maybe he was putting half block on top of a block that was still affected by error 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:00 but there is still a bug where u can't place a wedge on top of another wedge directly
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:07 that is the same for pontoon
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:29 try putting a wedge on top of a wedge
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:48 u'll find that u can't, it'll push ur wedge to a side
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:54:02 6 sides, one of the sides doesn't allow u to stack on
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:54:21 I'll show pic example of pontoon and wedge having this issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:44 
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:50 they get pushed aside
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:58 you cannot put blocks directly on them
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:56:15 previously, that would've resulted in error 69 but that is now fixed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:56:27 however, not being able to place on top of them is still an issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:06 dont know
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:12 doesn't seem to be
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:19 Rick is trying to fix all these issues
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:13:08 <@217336009455566848> u might as well fix this one while at it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:41:49 no, it was different before
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:41:59 before this
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:42:19 gun projectile actually stops at the initial block it hits, only then damages the next one after the initial one is destroyed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:42:32 I play plane crazy for pvp, so I know this one well
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:10 I've done the tests
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:20 I shot at a tnt armoured vehicle
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:35 the gun's bullet went through the entire vehicle ignoring the block infront of it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:46 and killed the man inside along with damaging every block in its way all at the same time
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:57:33 oh yeah I heard of that as well
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:57:43 pistons being major source of lag recently
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:52 all concept of armours flop due to new gun bug
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:37:56 yes that too
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:59 if we remember why PC2 is made over PC1, it's because PC1 is hardcoded, which means it's very difficult for rick to find and fix the errors, so this might take a while
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:55:55 omg
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:10 <@217336009455566848> I think plane crazy is starting to get a bug infestation
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:17 even fireworks broke
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:41 when u fire them, the fireworks projectile actually shoot somewhere away from the fireworks block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:01 and the faster u move, the further the projectile starts from the block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:10 in like random positions idk
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:34 they were working so fine earlier today
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:50 maybe we should collect a list of bugs
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:05:49 it's urgent and he should know about it, so that's most likely reasonable
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:13 there's a lot of bugs going on after recent update
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:25 if he isn't aware of it, we'll let him be aware of it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:39 we're the players he's the developer, that's how we work together to make a game great
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:07:58 probably problem with PC1's coding
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:08:03 PC1 is hardcoded afterall
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:09:01 this bug alone halted an entire pvp community
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:09:25 literally most of the battles cannot be conducted
bug-reports 2023-07-07 19:44:19 well everything is breaking
bug-reports 2023-07-07 19:44:28 bug infestation
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:20:36 so you're saying it's normal for it's bullet to start midair
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:02 no, clearly not, as a pvp'er that uses fireworks every pvp ever I can tell u
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:06 bullets don't start midair
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:12 but from the gun
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:16 gun blocks also need to be fixed, they are damaging everything in line all at the same time
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:35 before this update, they can only damage 1 block at a time
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:44 after this update, they are going through everything
bug-reports 2023-07-08 11:12:14 that's a minor problem
bug-reports 2023-07-08 11:12:41 main issues that are still on going is piston lag, error code 69 and gun block bug
bug-reports 2023-07-08 13:04:53 yes they are going through everything and damaging them while at it
bug-reports 2023-07-08 13:05:24 which is not how it's supposed to work, new update caused some unnoticeable bugs that is changing the game in bad way
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:14:02 bug fix when
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:14:10 many bugs
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:14:18 pls fix gun block bug
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:14:34 that thing is now overpowered
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:17:31 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:17:47 have like 10 block thick armour
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:17:51 then shoot a gun
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:17:56 all that armour doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 13:18:00 because the gun is just going through them
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 17:12:53 every notable bug is eventually going to be fixed and patched anyway
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 17:13:04 because it's needed before the transfer to pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 17:13:11 I assume
bug-reports 2023-07-10 08:19:36 ?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 07:29:40 or 25 drag disabled hover engines
bug-reports 2023-07-12 01:43:16 water propeller continues to provide thrust even after going out of water
bug-reports 2023-07-14 14:24:46 guns are still bugged
bug-reports 2023-07-14 14:24:55 it's bypassing blocks
