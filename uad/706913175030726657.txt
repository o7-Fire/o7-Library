For the nose, you can try to put regular blocks for the underside and then put 1x2 or 1x3 wedges at the tip. It's not going to look perfectly right but it's what I normally do when making fighter aircraft.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:05:04 I'd say if you really want to make it look more accurate, try looking at blueprints if you haven't already. They helped me a lot to keep aircraft dimensions to scale. If you want to change your plane, I wouldn't change the entire thing, but I would suggest you start from scratch and compare the newer build to the old one and keep the one you think is better.
