plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:36:14 Is there a way to make a seat just control one vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:37:00 what if u have 2 vehicles, but want the seats to just control the individual vehicle, is there a way to do that?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:37:27 <@!525244805756878889> pilot seat controls all of them

general 2020-10-10 18:02:54 is the fiasco over yet
help 2020-10-11 11:04:44 Its completely symmetrical, yet it still says the weight is off centre, is this a bug? Any help?
bot-central 2020-10-11 11:18:08 ?rhelp
help 2020-10-11 11:24:02 its a rocket
help 2020-10-11 11:24:17 everything is symetrical, 2 ways
help 2020-10-11 11:24:57 no, it circles/leans, lift is below the weight
help 2020-10-11 11:25:13 but they are still very close
help 2020-10-11 11:26:35 its still 2 way symetrical tho
help 2020-10-11 11:26:45 and the weight is off on the axis that is symmetrical
help 2020-10-11 11:26:55 so it makes no sense
help 2020-10-11 11:27:21 wdym
help 2020-10-11 11:27:35 like a counter weight?
help 2020-10-11 11:28:16 i dont know what happened, it worked fine yesterday
help 2020-10-11 11:28:21 now it doesnt
help 2020-10-11 11:31:35 <@!387897231161688064> bruh what

help 2020-12-17 21:16:13 How can you stabilise a rocket non-aerodynamically?
help 2020-12-17 21:17:01 like as it would with wings

help 2020-12-17 21:17:13 fly straight up
help 2020-12-17 21:17:41 ye
help 2020-12-17 21:18:13 ive seen tutorials on yt, but i want to understand what im building

help 2020-12-17 21:19:30 ye but then its just a helium balloon disguised as a rocket
help 2020-12-17 21:19:50 lol i dont have one im working on rn

help 2020-12-17 21:20:17 i got one rocket with wings if thats what u want
help 2020-12-17 21:20:30 im not trying to implement stabiliser into it tho
help 2020-12-17 21:20:52 coz i wanna make one from real life, and they dont have wings lol
help 2020-12-17 21:21:41 wdym
help 2020-12-17 21:22:16 ik, but there are ways around that
help 2020-12-17 21:22:43 well i guess im looking for the complicated way then
help 2020-12-17 21:23:06 that imperfection is what enables rocket stabilisers to exist
help 2020-12-17 21:23:33 im not going with real life physics lol
help 2020-12-17 21:23:51 but how stabilisers
help 2020-12-17 21:24:28 thats just driving it, and not stable
help 2020-12-17 21:24:37 i mean u press W and u dont need to worry
help 2020-12-17 21:24:57 ye but u need constant attention to keep it stable
help 2020-12-17 21:25:05 u can do that
help 2020-12-17 21:25:06 yes

help 2020-12-20 17:20:01 does a ballast block value of 2 correspond to the weight of 2 ordinary blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:31:39 yo does a ballast block value have the same weight as that many normal blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:32:51 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:33:15 u go first
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:33:43 do some good motor lockin magic should do the trick
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:34:11 Look up motor locking and experiment around a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:34:22 It takes some learnin but u get used to it
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:34:47 I also has questione
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:35:06 Is the value of a ballast block the equivelant weight of that many normal blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:36:04 And changing the value of a ballast block will visibly change the centre of mass right?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:36:20 damn
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:36:38 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:37:00 So is the official normal:Ballast ratio labbeled anywhere?
help 2020-12-20 17:37:34 is the official number written by a dev anywhere, everyone says its something different?
help 2020-12-20 17:38:28 aight, i shall experiment

plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:56:43 <@792186480327000064>
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:57:36 Well, you would need to make it REALLY heavy to only need one set of blades, so just add a counter rotating blade
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:58:12 Just add another set of blades on top of it that spins in the other direction
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:59:05 Wait

help 2020-12-29 15:00:58 how can i accomodate for the speed?
help 2020-12-29 15:01:08 there must be something else it lacks for it to wobble

plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:42:39 he is 100% 9
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:43:03 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:43:09 do cameras count towards weight

plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:48:18 cool
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:48:40 ive still used a mainly sign design anyway lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 21:48:50 minimal cameras
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 22:13:24 basically if u turn lock on, motor goes smush, and contracts meaning u can squeeze multiple blocks into the same space
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 22:13:48 and if u put it in cool patterns it can can do it ***even better***
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 22:14:06 umm
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 22:14:11 i guess

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:35:54 Are there any 3D non-collide objects?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:08 same
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:21 not fully tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:23 is it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:34 is it fully no collide?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:41 dammit
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:37:00 how do people hide their motor 2s then
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:38:01 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:38:50 nah i mean motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:38:56 like for flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:39:16 coz the motor is mostly non collide so that bits fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:39:25 but the camera i attach needs space
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:39:44 meaning i have to delete part of the wing which looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:41:27 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:41:34 its not normal to hide the motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:41:47 coz i been doin that all the time lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:42:05 thats litteraly kinda what i been doing
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:42:22 but with text
creations-chat 2021-01-05 19:44:42 <@!393679134779375616> how did u do this
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:47:29 <@!393679134779375616> how did u do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:48:24 ye, how did u merge a wedge with a wing, while still being able to control it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:48:48 ik what a motorlock is thank you very much mr helpful
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:49:20 like how do u motorlock something and still have it be on a motor?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:49:30 oh that makes much more sense
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:49:34 so wheres the real one
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:49:48 like in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:49:57 ahh, thats neat
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 19:50:16 well thx lol i was just curious
creations-chat 2021-01-05 20:42:14 bro some hothead acting salty 😳
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 11:34:26 Does camera locking save now
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 12:56:09 damn good advice
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 12:57:10 i wish there were more types of halfwedge tho, coz if u want to use a full variety of wedges for wings, then you have to go full block and sometimes thats just too thick
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:20:45 <@!723901129465004043> why did u choose maroon its disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:18 It is litteraly the most vile colour ever brought to humainty
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:26 I hate it so much
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:38 I litteraly hate maroon so much
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:48 Its not red its not brown its maroon
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:50 just why
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:21:56 cant it just not exist
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:22:11 ok maroon rant over
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:22:16 still hate it tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:45:57 u could do that thing where u get multiple of the same build turn them, then motorlock, idk if thats just me thinking dum tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:46:15 coz i think that can be used to create a cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:46:56 u do mean the cylinder part right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:47:08 oh u mean the not cylinder part
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:47:42 well that looks pretty 45 degrees tbf, so incorporate a decent bit of ordinary wedges i guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:48:08 bruh u guys planing on buying a plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:49:08 oh air force stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:49:14 1x1
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:49:27 that defo looks like a 1x1 to me
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:49:38 thats 1x1 all the way
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:50:06 like thats so right angle i could do the Pythagorean theorem on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:50:40 thats just 1x1 but with less steps
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:50:53 no thats defo a 1x1 job
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:51:36 isnt that just equivenalt to 2 1x2s or 4 1x1s?
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 13:51:50 like im sure u could already make that

creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:24:56 to avoid the cam lock
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:28:20 <@!453015366281723905> It is "delayed" yes
<@!555965248184778753> Where would the motors even go? Its a tail on a small plane.
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:31:25 But ***where*** would the motors go, i get u think i should attach them to the motorlock tower but thats not helpful, where could i hide them **and** still be functional at the same time?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:35:40 Ok, I'm just going to presume that you think I should motorlock them to the side of the plane, if I were to do that, it would mean having to cut away 2 blocks of the wing in order for that motor to function, and that looks arguably worse than having the motor out in plain sight
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:40:40 The fuselage is like 1 block wide that far back tho
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:43:40 I see ur point

creations-chat 2021-01-10 16:00:06 Hows this

creations-chat 2021-01-11 07:04:43 that looks straight da vinci style
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:27 u could just make one tall angular motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:48 thats what i gathered
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:07 how they spiral
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:55 I mean I'm saying angular motorlock like I've actually made anything with it in

general 2021-01-12 09:24:42 Was that the city one
general 2021-01-12 09:25:40 Isn't it easier to change the height of the rockets instead of changing the height of the wings?

plane-crazy 2021-02-18 02:50:48 Bruh how u gonna spin all that lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 02:52:38 I have seen people do it but it requires full half block of space in all directions, so if it's a big ish plane or engine, or not too heavily motorlocked it can probably be done

creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:56:25 No u don't, considering that the  majority of plane crazy builds look like this. I would actually consider his builds "decent". You are literally just attacking his build (which far exceeds his others) for the sake of attacking it.
creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:58:26 Yes, that is decent, if you were to compare to your average pc build
