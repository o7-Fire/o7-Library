build plates/panels
[building][gameplay]

Build plates are like wings panels/delta wings but they act like normal blocks and have no wing characteristics like lift and drag, so we can build without ruining how your creation functions. (also i think they should be in the middle of the block like the actual wing panel and you can change the material)
help 2020-12-04 07:53:06 yea and u can also change the material

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 19:43:00 its a skeleton, so yea ill do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 19:56:46 yea tru
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:32:38 its not cause of blocks, it cause of drag of the water
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:32:56 with out the helium blocks, alot of blocks are semerge
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:33:02 so theres alot of drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:33:35 but more helium reduces it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:34:06 if i dont hit anything i do lift out
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:34:30 theres just a half a block of blocks inside the water
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:43:23 you can search 1 in sketchfab
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 20:46:16 bad following of a blueprint

bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:44:40 when i paint all the fabric material, when theres a helium block in my build
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:44:52 it makes it so the helium is so much more powerful
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:45:22 heres my build without the fabric material
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:45:40 then here it is when i paint it all fabric
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:46:45 but here it is when i paint it back to default material
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:47:38 but when i save it and load it, it becomes normal
bug-reports 2021-06-18 23:50:04 <@!217336009455566848> i think its a bug

help 2021-08-17 14:34:52 The speed is Kph (Kilometers Per Hour)
And the plane crazy character runs at 40kph, so if you convert 40kph to mps (Meters Per Second). Its 11 meters
And if you run 11 blocks its takes 1 second in Plane crazy
So 1 Block = 1 Meter
help 2021-08-17 14:57:03 tru, but saying 1 meter = 1 block also proves my statement

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 13:24:09 you can try doing this, lil bit of piston lock so theres space for it
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 13:24:20 but wheel would hang
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 13:24:41 or just make the tracks 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 13:29:01 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 13:29:45 pick between half block treads or 3 wide thin treads?
