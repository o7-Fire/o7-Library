plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:33:52 what is the geneva convention
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:36:29 ew
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:37:05 so its just a kamikaze underwater missle
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:37:06 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:37:59 shredder bug without shredder but with boom
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:42:02 i find that problem all the time tbh
the-dump 2021-06-28 09:26:19 wow
the-dump 2021-06-28 09:26:22 this really is a dump
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:37 is that a propeller blade
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:38 on the side
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:46 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:48:15 motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:48:16 locks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:48:51 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:49:11 make a tracked aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:02 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:10 ballast block bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:11 on a
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:12 plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:14 motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:50:18 together into a carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:53:42 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:54:29 making a build more compact and smaller than it really is
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:54:31 pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:56:30 because high velocity mean big smack mean fling
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:56:47 my tank tracks cause other builds to lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:56:49 i need no turret
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:57:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:58:43 camera
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:59:08 very nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:00:39 tnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:00:40 tnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:00:50 pretty much just tnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:02:43 just uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:02:48 use ballast blocks for torpedoes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:03:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:04:07 i have specifically designed a landmine to shoot cutters right back at them
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:05:18 a-10 warthog maximized
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:05:32 to flex being bilingual
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:06:22 not like its gonna weigh more than the base of the zero
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:07:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:07:46 make a motorlocked minigun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:08:24 very nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:08:45 240mm american nuclear artillery piece
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:09:13 shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:09:16 i should make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:09:19 im gonna make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:09:20 eventually
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:09:47 quicklaunch gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:10:22 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:10:27 some more ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:10:40 build the quicklaunch gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:11:37 quicklaunch gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:11:39 very fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:13:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:13:28 make the spinning power the muzzle velocity
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:14:13 make a zero but make the base out of regular blocks only
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:14:31 like a flying carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:14:34 airship
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:15:44 make an ornothropter tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:16:47 because glass was melted
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:16:51 simple explanation
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:19:54 now make a plane that works stably at that speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:22:08 train aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:29:50 missile but with better tracking abilities
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:30:47 tracked aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:32:38 kill jets with a catapult
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:34:03 anti aircraft ballista
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:35:56 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:35:58 and
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:35:58 and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:35:59 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:36:14 hover drives are extremely unstable for me sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:36:19 so whatever
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:36:53 helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:37:59 conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:38:00 moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:01 now make a cannon to shoot it out of
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:21 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:26 make quicklaunch gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:41 1100 meters
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:43 long
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:51 3.3 miles per second muzzle velocity
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:42:54 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 05:01:59 make flying circle that acts as a multi-role aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 05:02:06 so that the projected power force is unstable
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 05:05:09 gonna make an aircraft shape rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:14:43 made a high speed plane design
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:14:53 and it isnt working properly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:14:56 gonna go fix it rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:46:08 not very fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:46:13 like
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:46:15 500
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:46:18 without motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:50:16 how fast should a triplane fighter be
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:50:18 like ww1 era
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:36 studs per second
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:37 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:49 well like
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:53 18k studs is a mile
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:56 according to roblox
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:52:39 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:52:42 5280 feet is a mile
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:53:13 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:53:13 so a stud is around .6 of a foot
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:53:19 just a triplane based on my own design
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:53:30 make it as it went along
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:54:29 max speed is
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:54:31 201
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:54:45 holdon
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:54:53 let me see how fast it would be if .6 studs was actually a foot
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:55:39 120 feet per second
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:56:10 120.6*
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:11:41 so its a bit slower than a fokker triplane
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:13:53 i should make a magnus effect plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:13:56 if the lift actually works
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:15:06 very little
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:15:11 unless you use 5x5 cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:37:05 ok now its not working
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:37:12 it literally glitches when im using only 2 motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:37:42 nah thats some broken sh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 07:42:33 how many motors should i use for the magnus effect plane
general 2021-08-16 07:55:21 the
general 2021-08-16 07:55:22 hell
general 2021-08-16 07:55:42 im usually 600 words under
general 2021-08-16 07:55:45 bruh
general 2021-08-16 07:58:32 .
general 2021-08-16 08:00:08 L
general 2021-08-16 08:00:35 yeah pretty much the basic format i usually have
general 2021-08-16 08:01:10 australian
general 2021-08-16 08:01:42 imagine not being 27% of the worlds land colonized by the briish
general 2021-08-16 08:03:43 make sense
general 2021-08-16 08:03:52 one for display, one for reality
general 2021-08-16 08:04:32 the m4 carbine?
general 2021-08-16 08:04:47 the m4 carbine is complained about a lot by us soldiers
general 2021-08-16 08:04:57 it doesnt have enough stopping power and takes several shots to actually down someone
general 2021-08-16 08:05:50 also
general 2021-08-16 08:05:52 its a carbine
general 2021-08-16 08:05:53 its cqc
general 2021-08-16 08:05:55 thats all
general 2021-08-16 08:06:01 cqc-medium range
general 2021-08-16 08:06:29 g36c is usually trash in actual combat
general 2021-08-16 08:06:33 but it has a nice design and look
general 2021-08-16 08:06:52 well
general 2021-08-16 08:06:58 i cant say anything about it really
general 2021-08-16 08:07:01 except that
general 2021-08-16 08:07:59 the leopard 2 out-preformed the m1a2 ( i think the a2) in several tank fests
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:08:15 it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:08:26 but you have to perfect weight and spinning
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:09:13 some guy literally like all of his rockets on a turret on a humvee
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:09:16 and a lot of guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:09:18 and some fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:09:20 on one turret
general 2021-08-16 08:10:08 yes
general 2021-08-16 08:10:09 citv
general 2021-08-16 08:10:12 idk if it had it
general 2021-08-16 08:10:17 it was different years of fests
general 2021-08-16 08:10:24 could've been  an m1a2 sepv3 one year
general 2021-08-16 08:10:30 and a regular m1 the last
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:08 what cylinders tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:11 2x2 or 3x3
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:15 or 5x5
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:20 alr
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:38 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:11:38 im gonna assume i have to connect an unpowered motor to the other side
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:13:19 well you really can
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:13:25 since infinity is basically every number
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:13:29 1 is infinity
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:13:30 ez
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:14:08 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:15:08 put wings on it and make magnus effect plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:15:10 ez
general 2021-08-16 08:17:28 speak in ooga booga language
general 2021-08-16 08:17:33 type*
general 2021-08-16 08:18:27 deepfry a plastic straw

general 2021-08-16 08:27:13 that grow out of the ground
general 2021-08-16 08:27:22 very many of them
general 2021-08-16 08:27:32 yeah
general 2021-08-16 08:27:39 red cylinders
general 2021-08-16 08:28:47 how does air taste
general 2021-08-16 08:28:52 i haven't tasted fresh air
general 2021-08-16 08:29:30 permission to shut the fuck up, drill sergeant?
general 2021-08-16 08:30:43 how do tree look
general 2021-08-16 08:32:04 make a p.2000 gott
general 2021-08-16 08:32:11 based on a fake design
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:36:15 so 3x3 cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:36:19 8 of them on each side
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:36:24 with four motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:36:25 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:37:48 hover drive?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:10 all i got is
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:13 hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:20 or are you using 2 terms for one thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:34 so same thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:38:35 basically
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:39:18 do i put 4 motors on the 8 3x3 cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:39:19 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:39:22 or put 2 on each side
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:44:56 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:45:11 unstable and wobbly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:45:12 a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:45:52 yk the superhornet
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:45:57 ez
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:45:57 well the us is creating the super warthog
general 2021-08-16 08:51:58 there are many
general 2021-08-16 08:52:01 su's
general 2021-08-16 08:56:34 ornothropter tank

general 2021-08-16 21:16:56 ok
general 2021-08-16 21:28:16 animal
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 05:04:43 do rifled barrels work or nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 05:13:22 triplane being shot down by a 240mm autocannon nuclear howitzer
creations-chat 2021-08-17 05:46:42 sounds like a post restriction issue
creations-chat 2021-08-17 05:51:40 no
creations-chat 2021-08-17 05:53:45 n
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:43:10 any way to make motors stronger besides torque
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:48:11 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:48:18 im trying to make a ballista
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:48:22 based on motors bending
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:48:28 and i cant use ropes since they'll glitch out
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 09:48:40 pistons also crash my game from what i've tested
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:36:16 so the ballista idea doesnt work so well
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:36:27 considering it has a seizure with its draw weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:05 no, motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:07 motors bend
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:11 and snap back in place
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:20 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:22 arms
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:22 as the
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:33 ropes suck so badly
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:37 when using them for things like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:39 so i dont
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:37:51 i put some suspension blocks on the bending motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:38:09 so it would have a good draw weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:38:17 and i had to put ropes on some of the parts
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:38:20 so they didnt fall apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:47:43 i could probably make suspension torsion
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:53:26 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:53:28 torsion doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 21:30:54 ornothropter tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:49:28 why is my submarine so laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:49:50 nah fr
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:49:56 its fine on land but when it goes into the water
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:50:00 big fps issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:50:12 too many ballast tanks?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:50:23 its not a device issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:50:32 i literally have a 4779 block build and it lags less while in water
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:51:10 im assuming is the ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:51:29 its
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:51:31 1959 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:51:44 significantly less than 4779 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:05 too much ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:09 game cant handle
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:17 its
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:23 fine on land
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:28 garbage in water
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:44 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:52:44 ballast tanks only work in water
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:53:04 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:53:17 tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:53:20 its a sub
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:54:07 the only things i use regular ballast blocks for
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:54:13 is making a boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:54:35 how many should i remove
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:54:37 out of
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:54:40 1351
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:55:21 cylinders and balls could have better aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:56:03 how many ballast tanks do i remove
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:56:04 out of 1351
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:56:22 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:56:37 ok then
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:42 cylinders have the magnus effect
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:44 and the balls do
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:47 but very very little
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:50 yes in game
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:57:51 i tested it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:58:10 i spun them up to a high speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:58:16 and they went a few studs forward and backwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:58:47 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 19:59:46 should i use engines or ballast tanks for a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:06 how many
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:08 at most
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:22 right now i have
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:23 1351 on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:26 and it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:28 lags
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:29 badly
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:51 how many should i use
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:00:52 at most
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:01:16 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:01:32 literally every square is a ballast tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:01:34 beside the front and back
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:01:57 im gonna
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:02:00 measure the dimensions rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:05:12 so about
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:05:14 84 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:05:54 all it is is the basic shape
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:05:56 not designed yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:00 
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:37 im gonna put a ballistic missle in it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:39 because why not
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:48 1351 ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:07:57 i might use rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:19 so should i just put them near the front and back
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:21 or in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:31 wouldn't that make it hard to surface
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:49 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:51 full weight ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:08:52 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:09:24 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:10:43 this thing fully sinks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:10:50 without having ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:11:29 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:11:35 full weight ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:11:37 or default
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:13:08 the back is probably heavier
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:13:15 since the propellers
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:13:59 im gonna
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:14:14 fully replace the top and bottom ballast tanks with ballast blocks or regular blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:14:18 see how that plays out
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:16:33 what is the glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:17:48 how fast does it go
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:17:54 because the pistons phase out at certain speeds
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:18:00 the hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:18:49 3k speed is a lot for hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:18:59 probably goes too fast for the pistons to stay stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:19:28 he said hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:19:51 idk then
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:19:57 there is a glitch where pistons can crash your game
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:19:59 with motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:20:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:20:25 motors bend
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:20:29 if you try to bend them with pistons
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:20:30 it breaks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:16 i only use conveyor engines and super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:23 tried a hover engine for a few months
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:27 and its
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:28 bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:31 wobbles
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:33 incredibly
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:24:34 badly
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:25:32 does it not wobble
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:25:42 i made a 3x3 jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:25:45 and it wobbles
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:25:47 badly
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:27:07 ok now im using around 650 ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:27:08 too much or nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:27:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:27:57 im getting 9 fps
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:28:01 seems more like 20
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:28:02 tf
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:28:15 im making a bms
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:28:38 ballistic missle submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:29:06 i might have to use conveyor engine to power it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:29:07 its slow ash
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:39:07 yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:39:09 conveyor engine it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:43:54 do magnets help with folding
general 2021-08-22 20:47:31 instead of a ballistic missile submarine
general 2021-08-22 20:47:36 i turned it into a ballistic missile
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:07 gunpowder block be like
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:19 infinite map?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:24 it shouldn't lag that bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:32 unless roblox does a big big unbrain move
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:35 and loads the entire map
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:37 for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:55 2 graphic levels can get me the entire map loaded
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:55:02 non dependant on how far it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:46 that sounds good
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:53 ambushes would be
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:57 logical
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:57:33 would it be random generated
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:57:34 per server
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:57:42 sounds fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:58:11 the map is too small for naval battles
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:58:14 unless its literally gunboats
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:58:22 plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:58:35 i can see landmines being effective
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:26 better map
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:32 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:33 better
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:35 mapmaking
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:02:12 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:42 they should add build locking blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:55 where the build locks together
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:06 if another block lock touches another
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:18 it connected
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:29 its like connecting after launching
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:31 basically
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:06:22 new blocks would be nice too
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:11 a bending material would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:14 or torsion materials
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:42 whitelist would be great
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:45 etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:45 for manning turrets
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:14:58 just add settings to a seat like how the camera is
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:15:03 and link it to what it can control
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:15:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:15:19 basically just a seperate seat for you
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:15:27 like if you want to control the entire ship
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:15:32 from a different perspective
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:16:01 my submarine goes 10k speed out of wtaer
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:16:02 water
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:16:12 so its light
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:16:13 out of water
general 2021-08-22 21:23:02 thats a regular pvp car
general 2021-08-22 21:23:03 so go ahead
general 2021-08-22 21:23:21 i saw a humvee with more weapons than a 1600s star fortress
general 2021-08-22 21:23:35 i made an anti cutter vehicle
general 2021-08-22 21:23:37 its cutter
general 2021-08-22 21:23:42 ontop of explosive blocks
general 2021-08-22 21:23:47 filled with explosive balls
general 2021-08-22 21:27:45 yamato is just a target practice ship
general 2021-08-22 21:27:55 free to shoot at
general 2021-08-22 21:29:31 massive submarines would be nice
general 2021-08-22 21:29:39 but its literally such a small lake
general 2021-08-22 21:37:58 should i make a working hatch for my submarine or just use trap doors
general 2021-08-22 22:04:55 any way to balance a submarine without having to spam wing panels
general 2021-08-22 22:24:39 any tank starting with t is obsolete
general 2021-08-22 22:24:42 unless its the armata
general 2021-08-22 22:24:58 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:25:04 any tank starting with a letter is obsolete
general 2021-08-22 22:25:09 naval shells go big boom yes
general 2021-08-22 22:25:44 t-14 armatas turret is small as hell
general 2021-08-22 22:25:49 but its unmanned
general 2021-08-22 22:25:50 so
general 2021-08-22 22:26:32 i made my submarine go 10k speed when out of water
general 2021-08-22 22:26:35 and its 1229 blocks
general 2021-08-22 22:26:38 1292
general 2021-08-22 22:26:40 something like that
general 2021-08-22 22:26:54 what should i put on my submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:26:57 84 blocks long
general 2021-08-22 22:27:12 intense arguing
general 2021-08-22 22:27:16 hm
general 2021-08-22 22:28:34 literally a mix between a sharpie marker and whiteout
general 2021-08-22 22:29:08 robots disgust
general 2021-08-22 22:29:09 we must learn
general 2021-08-22 22:30:42 i can rarely play pvp
general 2021-08-22 22:30:50 without getting chased by a conveyor engine plane with 5 guns in a line
general 2021-08-22 22:31:14 should i just put  missiles on my submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:31:16 or torpedoes aswell
general 2021-08-22 22:31:35 uh
general 2021-08-22 22:31:35 make uh
general 2021-08-22 22:32:04 make a mig-21
general 2021-08-22 22:32:07 because they're ugly
general 2021-08-22 22:32:09 ez
general 2021-08-22 22:32:38 LOL
general 2021-08-22 22:32:49 imagine armour piercing high explosive tank shells
general 2021-08-22 22:32:54 in plane crazy
general 2021-08-22 22:33:38 i just put a rotary autocannon and 2 rockets on a jet
general 2021-08-22 22:33:41 good for air support
general 2021-08-22 22:33:55 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:34:00 imagine if you could make ballistas
general 2021-08-22 22:34:15 torsion and bending blocks should be added
general 2021-08-22 22:34:30 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:34:52 put the schwerer gustav on the a-10 warthogs gau-8 avenger
general 2021-08-22 22:35:12 the ratte had 2 guns
general 2021-08-22 22:35:14 not the maus
general 2021-08-22 22:35:16 besides the machine guns
general 2021-08-22 22:35:18 or whatever
general 2021-08-22 22:35:47 its basically a tank cannon
general 2021-08-22 22:35:51 not an artillery cannon
general 2021-08-22 22:35:57 so
general 2021-08-22 22:36:54 literally a main gun and machine gun
general 2021-08-22 22:37:03 pretty sure they meant the main guns
general 2021-08-22 22:37:27 kv-2 vs a maus(if it worked obviously)
general 2021-08-22 22:37:41 wait no
general 2021-08-22 22:37:45 very good question
general 2021-08-22 22:37:49 100 sturmtigers
general 2021-08-22 22:37:52 vs the yamato
general 2021-08-22 22:39:03 sHEESh
general 2021-08-22 22:41:03 anti aircraft submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:41:04 no
general 2021-08-22 22:41:04 wait no
general 2021-08-22 22:41:07 tracked submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:41:09 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:41:09 submarine tank
general 2021-08-22 22:41:23 someone put tracks on a submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:41:26 now
general 2021-08-22 22:42:24 what all should i put on my submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:42:46 should i put torpedoes or nah
general 2021-08-22 22:43:02 its 84 blocks long
general 2021-08-22 22:43:16 can i just put a nuke inside of it
general 2021-08-22 22:43:34 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:43:34 i will make it carry tanks
general 2021-08-22 22:43:39 i have them on it
general 2021-08-22 22:43:40 already
general 2021-08-22 22:43:46 im talking about
general 2021-08-22 22:43:47 weapons
general 2021-08-22 22:43:49 what kind of weapons
general 2021-08-22 22:52:07 the new map is gonna be random generation
general 2021-08-22 22:52:10 is what someone told me
general 2021-08-22 22:52:37 bonked by a submarine
general 2021-08-22 22:55:00 yes
general 2021-08-22 22:58:17 bow and arrow isnt obsolete
general 2021-08-22 22:58:26 ill mount it to a tank in pc2
general 2021-08-22 22:59:00 if bending materials exist
general 2021-08-22 22:59:03 or torsion materials
general 2021-08-22 22:59:04 ill make one
general 2021-08-22 23:01:32 bruh
general 2021-08-22 23:01:57 what would be the point of an idle carrier
general 2021-08-23 00:32:45 because rp
general 2021-08-23 00:32:54 etc
general 2021-08-23 00:32:54 children have no gameplay standards
general 2021-08-23 00:33:04 its basically how adopt me is played so much
general 2021-08-23 00:34:41 or nah
general 2021-08-23 00:34:41 should i put control panels on my sub
general 2021-08-23 02:17:04 2 trillion zimbabwe dollars
general 2021-08-23 02:19:45 b is using glass wings
general 2021-08-23 02:20:14 jerboas could fly with their ears
general 2021-08-23 02:20:19 if they could move them fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 02:22:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 02:24:12 you need to do double rotor or one rotor and a tail rotor
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 02:24:15 for helis to work
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 02:24:50 nah bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 02:24:54 just use cameras

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:09:53 if the entire map fully loaded
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:10:07 you'd be getting adopt me and brookhaven 50x the lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:10:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:10:37 i'd like different choices of biomes or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:10:42 like you can choose a specific one
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:10:47 or just have it all
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:11:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:11:11 they should add paper airplanes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:11:14 because fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:11:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:11:46 you can do that right now
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:06 scale tool will be nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:13 less having to search for a block
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:30 i can see field artillery being common for pvp servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:35 and magnet guns being common
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:41 if its gonna be infinite map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:12:57 shredders will be garbage
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:02 too widespread for them to find you
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:10 how fast do shredders even fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:11 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:28 fighter jets will dominate the air
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:13:47 field artillery will dominate long range shots
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:14:15 i tried to make a cylindrical rotor blade helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:14:17 but no magnus effect
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:14:18 cry
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:14:49 magnet guns will be extremely common
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:15:03 groups and sh will also be common
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:15:30 what the hell am i looking at
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:15:47 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:15:53 vtol
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:15:55 nice

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:16:53 tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:16:59 tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:17:07 tomromow
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:17:23 24 hours from this moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:17:51 imagine someone making a mach 40 muzzle velocity field howitzer
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:18:05 put a tank turret on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:18:06 easy solve
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:18:50 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:18:52 no ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:19:30 there will be infinite ideas with an infinite map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:19:43 unless there is literally a pit surrounding the spawning plots
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:27 imagine digging tools
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:29 for the terrain
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:33 but a limit
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:34 so
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:37 you cant dig a hole
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:20:54 infinite map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:00 no one is gonna waste  their entire time doing that
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:07 unless they're literally braindead
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:16 ik
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:18 they will
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:33 working mark II tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:41 right
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:21:42 organized griefers
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:19 roblox wont crash
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:24 its not gonna load the entire map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:29 actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:31 they will
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:39 roblox literally loads the entire map when im on graphic level 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:22:45 and it surpasses the actual range of graphic level 10
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:23:16 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:23:36 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:23:40 make that one tank plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:23:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:01 tracked submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:03 ornothropter tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:24 ornothropter aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:33 tracked helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:38 put tracks on everything
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:52 the us military has the budget to do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:24:53 probably
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:25:01 gonna suggest they do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:25:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:25:06 airborne tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:25:47 i made a tracked aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:25:54 what else should i put tracks on
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:26:00 no detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:26:05 literally just helium tracks suspension and folding
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:26:14 and motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:27:05 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:27:08 planck length wide tracks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:27:09 for the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:27:37 would it even be possible to fold tracks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:24 no instead of halo ghost
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:26 build ghost
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:28 use camers
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:31 cameras
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:32 simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:28:46 naval battles will be fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:29:00 because you'll get ambushed by a submarine that has a schwerer gustav attached to it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:29:12 water physics would be great
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:29:14 for example
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:29:33 a f-15 cant send in bombs through the water to hit my submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:29:34 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:30:07 i literally got one shotted by a submarine made of balllast tanks and explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:30:37 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:30:55 i should've got my air to ground support jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:30:58 and it has a rotary cannon
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:31:00 so fun time
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:31:30 flying has no boundaries
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:31:32 and no limits
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:31:35 because no stall
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:32:26 my jet literally just has a motorlocked rotary autocannon with 2 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:32:39 because no need for much when you can spray everything within a radius
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:33:06 aa tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:33:11 or fast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:33:28 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:34:28 shredders being spammers until the icbm starts stalking them
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:34:58 submarines are literal garbage in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:35:03 they have the smallest area of use
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:35:18 thats why an infinite map is a necessity
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:35:27 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:35:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:35:44 because i cant even arm my sub
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:01 no point once i get struck by an a-10 warthog made of explosive blocks and ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:07 radar blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:08 would be
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:11 great
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:24 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:27 angled armour seems to work
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:32 or some glitchy sh
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:34 seems to work
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:39 in deflecting off tracking rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:36:46 so imagine stealth technology
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:37:00 to detect obsolete shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:37:26 infinite until it cant load properly anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:37:50 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:37:53 how big will the map be then
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:38:00 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:38:12 that still might be small too be frankly honest
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:38:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:38:55 my submarine literally cant submerge unless its in the deep part
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:09 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:16 intercontinental ballistic missile submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:22 but the submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:24 is the icbm
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:42 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:43 water jets
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:45 are
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:39:46 obsolete
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:40:33 jet engines should get a buff
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:40:50 why not
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:05 jet engines good realistically? yes yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:14 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:15 plus
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:18 on a larger scale map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:26 i can use my intercontinental ballistic catapult
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:41:54 and realistically
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:01 blackbird neede
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:04 significantly less
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:07 and it went mach 3.3
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:45 making it realistically like a radar would be nearly impossible
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:50 etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:50 deflective materials
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:42:51 be like
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:43:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:43:51 an armour
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:43:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:43:57 ballast type weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:02 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:04 good strength
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:11 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:18 explosive blocks should weigh more
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:22 or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:25 to nerf the spam of them
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:47 every pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:44:51 atleast 1-3 players
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:31 like
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:33 pure gold?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:46 pure gold?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:47 or
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:49 modified gold
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:51 or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:54 because pure gold
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:56 good currency
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:45:58 trash armour
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:46:16 i would literally trust rope more as an armour
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:46:42 and you get a nice target for my howitzer
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:26 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:30 imagine armour piercing materials
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:35 or
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:37 whatever
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:47:44 gunpowder block
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:48:47 the funny thing is
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:48:52 i rarely have encountered shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:01 i literally get explosive block spammers over anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:04 or cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:06 etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:06 or spawnkillers
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:15 big flying thing that annoys you
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:22 its like a mosquito on an entirely different level
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:49:49 what the hell are you gonna carry in that

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:50:30 ac-130 gunships
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:51:29 icbm with fighter jet manueverabiliy and the ability to redo its attacks over and over again
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:17 imagine landmines

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:51:37 i am
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:51:40 if the map is infinite
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:51:43 and random generated
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:05 infinite amount of weapons to make
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:07 field artillery
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:08 etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:22 thats

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:46 trenches:alpha does that
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:51 but a small map
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:53:52 trenches:alpha is a game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:53:57 in roblox

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:14 by using
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:16 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:26 again
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:32 it renders once you reach a distance
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:36 does no one understand that
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:57 one map might literally be a hill
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:06:58 that keeps going up
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:00 and up
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:01 and up
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:02 and up
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:03 etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:10 and one might be completely flat
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:14 with a few bumps
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:54 im gonna motorlock rope together
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:07:56 because fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:08:55 ok so
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:09:01 it just strands them all at one single point

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:10:27 fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:10:46 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:10:54 it just adds on to the piston face layers
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:11:35 what should i motorlock together
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:11:49 gonna do a piston motor and disconnector
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:11:51 for free glitching
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:14:18 motorlock 2 opposite facing propeller blades for perfect lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:14:21 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:14:45 what do i motorlock now

general 2021-08-28 23:47:39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster

general 2021-08-28 23:53:27 that literally a big ass target for artillery strikes
general 2021-08-28 23:53:29 and airstrikes
general 2021-08-28 23:54:07 land battleships
general 2021-08-28 23:54:09 garbage concept
general 2021-08-28 23:54:15 considering
general 2021-08-28 23:54:18 literal battleships
general 2021-08-28 23:54:20 are obsolete now
general 2021-08-28 23:54:50 a new type of ship might be created specifically for us railguns
general 2021-08-28 23:54:54 once they finish the testing
general 2021-08-28 23:54:56 and issue it
general 2021-08-28 23:55:24 the briish created tanks
general 2021-08-28 23:55:26 what do you expect
general 2021-08-28 23:55:41 yes
general 2021-08-28 23:55:43 trench warfare
general 2021-08-28 23:55:44 vs
general 2021-08-28 23:55:46 every warfare
general 2021-08-28 23:56:06 LOL
general 2021-08-28 23:56:08 the suitcase nuke
general 2021-08-28 23:56:41 american mass production
general 2021-08-28 23:56:45 literally
general 2021-08-28 23:56:47 everything
general 2021-08-28 23:56:47 killed
general 2021-08-28 23:57:33 america literally created nuclear artillery
general 2021-08-28 23:58:01 and mass produce it
general 2021-08-28 23:58:08 same for the soviets
general 2021-08-28 23:58:09 etc
general 2021-08-28 23:58:09 bigger the better
general 2021-08-28 23:59:04 get your teeth whitened for the last time in your life
general 2021-08-28 23:59:50 imagine if magnet guns were actually effective in game
general 2021-08-29 00:00:02 considering you can send shots literally 10k studs on a 1k stud map
general 2021-08-29 00:00:52 they should replace regular cutters with cylindrical cutters
general 2021-08-29 00:00:56 so we can put them in a barrel and fire them
general 2021-08-29 00:01:26 think about it tho
general 2021-08-29 00:01:28 armour piercing shells
general 2021-08-29 00:01:43 yes
general 2021-08-29 00:01:52 but it requires suspension and
general 2021-08-29 00:01:53 armour piercing bombs
general 2021-08-29 00:01:53 yeah
general 2021-08-29 00:02:28 armour piercing rounds would literally just be a cutter spinning from rifled magnet guns through a target and killing the person inside probably
general 2021-08-29 00:02:44 rifled magnet guns are fairly effective
general 2021-08-29 00:02:46 from what i've seen
general 2021-08-29 00:03:24 since when
general 2021-08-29 00:03:48 why would that be stupid
general 2021-08-29 00:03:55 sticky grenade launcher
general 2021-08-29 00:03:57 be like
general 2021-08-29 00:04:21 that could literally be used to counter shredders
general 2021-08-29 00:04:28 so they get stuck
general 2021-08-29 00:04:35 and you can shoot them
general 2021-08-29 00:43:14 j
general 2021-08-29 00:43:32 yeah
general 2021-08-29 00:43:42 need to watch your damn language

general 2021-08-29 00:45:26 ah yes
general 2021-08-29 00:45:36 but gravity would crush her before she got to that size
general 2021-08-29 00:46:11 visible universe
general 2021-08-29 00:46:15 or the invisible
general 2021-08-29 00:54:38 ok
general 2021-08-29 00:54:44 put chainsaw grip on a m777 howitzer
general 2021-08-29 00:55:15 9.3k pounds
general 2021-08-29 00:55:16 not that much
general 2021-08-29 00:56:17 its 42% lighter than the m198 howitzer
general 2021-08-29 00:56:35 around 15k pounds
general 2021-08-29 00:56:49 yeah
general 2021-08-29 00:56:51 15,772
general 2021-08-29 00:57:09 9,300 pounds
general 2021-08-29 00:57:14 vs 15.7k pounds
general 2021-08-29 00:58:14 the m3 howitzer only weighs 42 pounds
general 2021-08-29 00:58:20 it was used by airborne forces
general 2021-08-29 00:58:21 apparently
general 2021-08-29 00:59:37 the fact that the briish used naval guns for ww1 tanks
general 2021-08-29 00:59:41 is scary
general 2021-08-29 01:04:15 the mark 4 is 31 tons
general 2021-08-29 01:04:19 thats
general 2021-08-29 01:04:21 light
general 2021-08-29 01:04:23 considering its
general 2021-08-29 01:04:24 huge
general 2021-08-29 01:04:46 imagine if pc2 has manual loading
general 2021-08-29 01:04:55 pick up explosive ball
general 2021-08-29 01:04:57 put down barrel

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:47:43 and different types of weapons
general 2021-08-29 04:48:46 they do
general 2021-08-29 04:49:00 with that being said
general 2021-08-29 04:49:12 im going to go bully a bomber plane with  rifled magnet gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:49:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:50:09 armour piercing is kinda possible now
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:50:10 for magnet guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:51:01 for recon planes they're good
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:51:02 realistically
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 04:51:24 but not  fighters
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:29:05 yes

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:29:08 spam
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:29:18 basically how every public pvp jet i see is
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:29:42 i literally use 2 rockets on my jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:29:54 guess i'll up the spam
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:30:11 shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:30:15 blender
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:30:34 cutters are literally
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:30:36 too op
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:30:54 "ah yes let me scratch this piece of steel so it disconnects
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:31:05 ik how cutter bombs are
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:31:24 i thought of using them for sea mines
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:31:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:03 i made an armour piercing high velocity howitzer
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:10 all it does is fire a ball
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:15 and it goes through the blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:18 or whatever im shooting at
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:39 no i mean like
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:41 dummy rounds
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:45 it can pierce through
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:32:48 blacklist wals
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:33:01 i rifled it too
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:33:18 which probably contributes to its range a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:33:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:34:21 the rifling is also what makes the armour piercing easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:34:24 im assuming
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:08:57 a nuclear howitzer
general 2021-08-29 09:09:19 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:11:21 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:11:31 add a picture of a nuclear howitzer
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:14:25 because mig
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:15:07 the mig-21 is literally known as the flying coffin
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:15:32 240mm nuclear howitzer*
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:16:25 the mig-21 literally looks like someone decided to put as much shit as they could on an apfsds tank shell
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:16:58 make it fire parachute bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:18:07 the antonov a-40 is literally the best looking plane i have ever seen pre vietnam war era
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:18:52 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:19:02 put a gun carrier on top of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:19:08 and put the 240mm howitzer on top of the gun carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:22:18 thats literally just the p-1500 monster
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:23:27 magnet powered
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:23:34 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:23:44 its possible
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:23:49 it isnt that efficient
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:24:24 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:24:29 sounds like a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:24:51 make it piston powered
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:25:02 custom repetitive piston yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:25:49 800mm shell
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:25:55 it makes the yamato look like a piece of garbage
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:26:09 it doubles the yamatos 18 inch shells in size almost
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:27:21 do remember yamato got sunk
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:27:41 america could literally create an island size battleship in ww2 if they really wanted too
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:27:49 since they literally had 29 aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:29:34 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:29:37 for instance
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:29:45 in like 1933 or something around that time
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:29:55 us military wanted around a few hundred browning mgs
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:30:01 general motors i believe
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 09:30:03 gave them 22k

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:31:41 nah bro
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:31:49 thats some small shit compared to what i witness in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:31:53 for example
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:31:55 turret spam
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:32:08 a  vehicle made entirely of explosives and weapons
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:33:05 i've rarely been against shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:33:26 i'm usually against spawnkilling kids who think they're god simply because they put motor 2 with a gun attached
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:33:51 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:35:12 dominating in pvp literally takes no effort
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:35:30 put every ranged weapon on a turret and you got a weapon spam
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:35:36 and throw some cutter armour aswell
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:35:40 make it spin around your vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:40:52 i just put a conveyor on my sub

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:26 fastest engine in the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:30 conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:37 not just a regular conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:40 friction blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:43 or whatever you want
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:42:46 use them for an engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:43:01 the conveyor and friction block touch eachother
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:43:07 and both are attached to whatever build you want
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:43:15 and when the conveyor moves
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:43:17 it moves the entire build
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:43:54 its basically what you want to use on a big ass plane or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:44:04 super rockets are good too
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:44:19 conveyor is good for a simple and compact fast engine

general 2021-09-03 00:49:16 there is
general 2021-09-03 00:49:25 not really any perfectly round armour on the leopard 2
general 2021-09-03 00:49:50 the leopard 1 is slightly rounded
general 2021-09-03 00:49:56 but that could probably be made
general 2021-09-03 00:53:35 floating

general 2021-09-03 03:33:15 aerodynamics rank?
general 2021-09-03 03:33:49 if i put a wing panel on a super rocket do i get the aeronautical rank
general 2021-09-03 03:35:46 real
general 2021-09-03 22:35:11 sounds like an angling issue
general 2021-09-03 23:33:12 what
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:33:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:44:12 it appears bofors and porsche decided to team up and create some overengineered shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:45:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:45:16 same
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:45:37 i prefer making a fucking pulley ballista rather than creating a magnet gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:45:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:46:00 shit goes 2600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:46:02 with one block
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:46:09 and with ballista bolts
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:46:15 it goes 400-700
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:50:09 so the ballista is literally just 4 suspension blocks and a pulley arm
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:50:26 and a turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:50:28 because
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:50:32 aiming is good yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:51:12 its literally just suspension max stiffness and least free length
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:51:34 also i let the suspension glide itself
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:51:44 its like a slingshot
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:52:14 put a fucking howitzer on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:52:17 turn it into a gunship
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:53:50 its literally just a bit above 60 blocks without a turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:54:24 put a fucking block with delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:54:33 see if you get upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:55:41 imagine not making a magnet gun rifled
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:56:13 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:56:19 it increases lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:56:25 and penetrating power
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:56:27 for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:10:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:10:19 not much of a skill issue anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:13:38 ok one question

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:31:28 most of them are on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:31:29 obviously
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:31:33 but when that shit goes into the air

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:32:26 i  made a ballista
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:32:28 and it slings bolts at tanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:32:29 ez
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:33:01 helis are kinda useless in pvp if someone can manuever their plane right and airstrike you
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:33:22 literally impossible
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:33:42 swear to god everytime i put anything in the air

plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:26:30 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:26:59 efp is literally the shittiest anti tank mine thing i've ever seen

plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:27:09 or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:01 the funny thing is
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:03 it doesnt fucking work
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:07 because the magnus effect
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:08 is very
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:09 obsolete
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:11 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:29 it might be
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:30 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:35 you'll just need a shitton of motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:48 you'll need to spin the cylinders themselves
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:28:54 and the connection of them
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:29:24 it would be a pretty fucking cool type of propeller system
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:29:30 but idk about speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:30:03 literally just conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:30:09 friction blocks and conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:04 pistons
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:05 i guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:09 would be pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:16 if the speed goes too fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:19 they would
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:22 reduce ita bit
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:27 it can work without
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:32 but its a lot more unstable
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 20:31:33 i think
general 2021-09-17 21:59:34 watt
general 2021-09-17 22:01:13 literally anyone can do a mainland british accent

plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:03:05 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:03:08 AHAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:03:25 cylinder cutters
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:03:27 for tank shells
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:03:28 imagine
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:04:21 so basically just shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:05:01 call them shredder interceptors
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:05:08 like everyone who makes shredder bugs does
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:05:45 literally just make a missile and fill it with cutter blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:05:56 put them ontop of the explosives so they propel out of the end
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:06:04 literally just a claymore missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:06:28 cylindrical cutters would be pretty fun for ap tank shells
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:06:30 but not as op
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:06:32 as they are rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:10 you can already make guns armour piercing by spinning the ball
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:17 but you cant fit a cutter and make it spin
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:40 cutter cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:44 like the pryamid wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:46 but a cutter
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:07:49 like a spearpoint
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:10:22 jupiter but without gas but with a desert and gravity
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:10:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:10:46 not jupiter
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:11:20 jupiter got a fucking hurricane while being a gas giant
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:11:25 very fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:11:57 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:10 but the great red spot
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:11 most known
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:13 obviously
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:50 yes

general 2021-09-18 00:02:56 imagine efp shells for a tank
general 2021-09-18 00:03:52 efp is cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:05:41 shEEEsh
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:05:56 ok now add tracks
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:05:57 ez
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:06:14 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:06:29 jokes on you
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:06:31 i dont give a shit about ranks
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 00:06:40 i asked myself
general 2021-09-18 00:07:36 not even arena
general 2021-09-18 00:07:38 its literally just
general 2021-09-18 00:07:46 "spam every projectile weapon mode"
general 2021-09-18 00:08:40 literally just low effort fucking anti-life builds
general 2021-09-18 00:08:53 20 block car with a gun spam
general 2021-09-18 00:09:30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator how is this a good thing
general 2021-09-18 00:10:00 no
general 2021-09-18 00:10:05 its literally just a flat concave thing
general 2021-09-18 00:10:23 yes
general 2021-09-18 00:10:31 and gets fucked by composite armour
general 2021-09-18 00:10:41 since it will literally act as a hesh shell
general 2021-09-18 00:10:51 its literally turning a flat thing into a projectile
general 2021-09-18 00:27:44 pcc moment
general 2021-09-18 00:31:56 what about medieval british
general 2021-09-18 00:31:58 ez
general 2021-09-18 00:31:58 before hastings
general 2021-09-18 00:33:43 or literally just air friction
general 2021-09-18 00:36:37 yes
general 2021-09-18 00:36:50 nah bro
general 2021-09-18 00:36:52 buy a leopard 1

general 2021-09-18 01:03:04 fuck
general 2021-09-18 01:03:28 imagine cylindrical pyramid wedge cutter
general 2021-09-18 01:03:32 armour piercing rounds
general 2021-09-18 01:03:33 funn
general 2021-09-18 01:04:05 yes
general 2021-09-18 01:04:10 like a spear head
general 2021-09-18 01:04:23 resize too isnt added yet tho
general 2021-09-18 01:04:25 right?
general 2021-09-18 01:04:52 its a pyramid wedge cylindrical cutter
general 2021-09-18 01:05:01 how the fuck are you gonna make that
general 2021-09-18 01:05:24 so you can reshape a cutter
general 2021-09-18 01:05:25 ok
general 2021-09-18 01:05:51 it-
general 2021-09-18 01:05:52 ok then
general 2021-09-18 01:05:53 ill wait
general 2021-09-18 01:06:58 its literally impossible to make a cylindrical cutter
general 2021-09-18 01:06:59 but ill wait
general 2021-09-18 01:08:06 its literally a pyramid wedge
general 2021-09-18 01:08:09 but instead of 4 faces
general 2021-09-18 01:08:13 it has a circular shape
general 2021-09-18 01:08:15 that goes to a point
general 2021-09-18 01:08:51 also
general 2021-09-18 01:08:56 armour piercing already works
general 2021-09-18 01:09:04 without having to create that one bomb shit
general 2021-09-18 01:09:08 all you have to do is spin the projectile
general 2021-09-18 01:09:45 ok
general 2021-09-18 01:09:47 let me explain
general 2021-09-18 01:09:49 its literally just a cone
general 2021-09-18 01:11:19 basically just rifling the barrel with magnets
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:21:51 i made a magnet gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:21:51 alr
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:21:56 it can penetrate 0.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:22:08 with 9 mangets
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:22:09 magnets
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:33:36 rifled tank cannon
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:33:52 the
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:33:56 rifling increases lift and range
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:34:05 but not velocity
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:35:16 also increases its ability to go through things
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:38:15 friction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:38:20 even cylinders have friction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:38:23 but balls dont for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:38:25 barely any
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:40:47 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:40:53 its better than a regular magnet gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:41:01 in terms of efficiency
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:41:03 from what i've tested
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:41:14 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:42:02 literally plenty of examples on youtube
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:42:10 all you do is put the magnets in a coil around the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:42:26 which causes it to propel forward but also spin
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:43:06 think of how rifling works
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:43:10 literally the exact same way
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:43:14 more range
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:43:15 same velocity
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:43:20 better at piercing
general 2021-09-18 01:45:06 ok
general 2021-09-18 01:45:07 show me
general 2021-09-18 01:45:19 yes
general 2021-09-18 01:45:21 literally a cone
general 2021-09-18 01:45:22 cutter
general 2021-09-18 01:47:00 yes
general 2021-09-18 01:47:06 literally like a spear
general 2021-09-18 01:47:22 or a sniper round
general 2021-09-18 01:48:13 ok
general 2021-09-18 01:48:58 i want a cutter with only one connection point
general 2021-09-18 01:49:03 so it literally has to be a cone
general 2021-09-18 01:49:15 so it wont grip the size of the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:27 it looks fairly similar
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:39 i dont want you to make it
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:43 because its impossible to make it
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:56 it quite literally is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:50:58 to make a cone
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:17 a cone
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:30 it would act like a cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:32 but with less friction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:38 so a ball with a connection point
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:51:41 in terms of friction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:54:38 that is
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:54:40 close as hell
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:54:41 but again
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:54:45 its too wide to fit in a barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:55:20 it would be pretty good for a half block barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:56:09 literally this
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:56:10 is what i want
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:56:11 as a cutter
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:56:41 exactly what i was saying
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:56:49 when you turn blocks they get wider than a singular block
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:01:00 make a 1x4 corner wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:02:33 is that a hesh round
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:03:13 hesh is good for smashing shit to  pieces
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:03:15 like concrete
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:03:21 thats about all
general 2021-09-18 02:04:56 to make it look icelandic
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:09:27 is it a skill issue if my tank turret glitches the fuck out
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:09:44 ok

the-dump 2021-09-18 02:12:07 L
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:13:49 just use suspension magazine

plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:09 bro
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:11 i tried to do that
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:15 the cylinder friction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:17 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:18 when i
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:19 make it
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:43 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:29:45 ass
general 2021-09-18 02:30:22 bolt action
general 2021-09-18 02:30:24 suspension
general 2021-09-18 02:30:25 magazine
general 2021-09-18 02:30:38 yes
general 2021-09-18 02:30:46 literally just look up "how a kar-98k works"
general 2021-09-18 02:30:53 literally that same exact concept
general 2021-09-18 02:32:07 ok so
general 2021-09-18 02:32:11 suspension push bullet up to block
general 2021-09-18 02:32:19 there is an opening behind and infront
general 2021-09-18 02:32:26 bolt action rifle push bullet forward
general 2021-09-18 02:32:30 bullet go into chamber
general 2021-09-18 02:32:35 pull trigger go boom boom
general 2021-09-18 02:33:25 yes
general 2021-09-18 02:33:30 then your bayonet
general 2021-09-18 02:33:35 may cause shit
general 2021-09-18 02:33:39 for example
general 2021-09-18 02:33:44 it is aerodynamic
general 2021-09-18 02:33:48 so push your gun forwards
general 2021-09-18 02:33:57 it will propel it slightly more if you fire while doing so
general 2021-09-18 02:34:51 causing gas build up make boom boom
general 2021-09-18 02:34:54 if rifled
general 2021-09-18 02:34:56 bullet spins
general 2021-09-18 02:34:58 due to frictio
general 2021-09-18 02:34:59 n
general 2021-09-18 02:35:32 then another shot rises
general 2021-09-18 02:35:35 repeat
general 2021-09-18 02:35:35 push it forward
general 2021-09-18 02:36:05 i think
general 2021-09-18 02:36:05 it rises up slightly
general 2021-09-18 02:36:16 the bolt catches the bullet and the bullet goes over a ramp type thing
general 2021-09-18 02:36:21 into the chamber
general 2021-09-18 02:36:23 or something like that
general 2021-09-18 02:37:36 ez
general 2021-09-18 02:37:45 it has the stopping block like a catapult
general 2021-09-18 02:37:46 i think
general 2021-09-18 02:38:07 ok
general 2021-09-18 02:38:16 lets now talk about nuclear howitzers
general 2021-09-18 02:38:20 which i do not own any of
general 2021-09-18 02:38:31 hahaha
general 2021-09-18 02:38:37 howitzer propel nuclear shell
general 2021-09-18 02:38:41 hit ground cause boom boom
general 2021-09-18 02:38:44 because of atom firing
general 2021-09-18 02:39:42 oh no
general 2021-09-18 02:39:44 a dmr
general 2021-09-18 02:40:01 dragunov and g28 are the only dmrs i like
general 2021-09-18 02:41:11 "teenager vs a silverback gorilla"
general 2021-09-18 02:41:45 howitzer vs coca cola can
general 2021-09-18 02:42:38 anti tank landmine vs garbage can lid shield
general 2021-09-18 02:43:19 ok
general 2021-09-18 02:43:21 i have a great idea
general 2021-09-18 02:43:23 someone make a tank
general 2021-09-18 02:43:26 but instead of a turret
general 2021-09-18 02:43:28 add a catapult
general 2021-09-18 02:43:30 or ballista
general 2021-09-18 02:43:31 simple
general 2021-09-18 02:44:05 you said you can do anything with motorlock right
general 2021-09-18 02:44:40 motorlock a wing into a cylinder for a plane propeller
general 2021-09-18 02:44:43 ez
general 2021-09-18 02:44:43 and call it the magnus effect
general 2021-09-18 02:47:04 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:06 because roblox said so
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:25 again
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:27 because roblox said so
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:31 no reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:35 simply because we play their game
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:43 in return they take 75% of hardworking developers money
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:48:53 and they give us some shitass french revolution era servers
general 2021-09-18 02:49:06 yes
general 2021-09-18 02:50:42 ok

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:36:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:36:36 it had a fucking seizure
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:36:50 armour piercing is a thing aswell
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:36:54 all you gotta do is spin the projectile
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:36:58 fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:01 basically like rifling
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:19 one rifled magnet gun coil
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:23 so just one coil of rifling
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:28 can pierce 0.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:51 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:52 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:37:54 a half block
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:30 coil the magnets
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:32 around the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:40 so its forced to propel forwards
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:46 and spin at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:49 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:52 you can
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:38:58 make them inside of the tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:07 and the barrel be half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:09 extending outwards
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:14 also
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:18 the riflings effects range
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:23 and bullet drop
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:39:28 but not really velocity that much
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:34 lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:34 motor
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:37 the gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:40 inside of the tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:43 then motorlock the roof
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:44 on top
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:40:59 literally fucking
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:01 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:04 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:05 the turret part
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:16 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:20 all you need inside of the turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:24 is for it to go up and down
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:27 unless its a tank destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:32 then you need both inside of hte turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:36 otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:41 you connect the entire fucking turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:41:43 to one motor
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:06 breechloading
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:08 aswell
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:48 basically this
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:49 but
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:50 magnets
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:42:52 in a coil
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:44:08 think of the armour piercing part as
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:44:17 a spinning ground drill
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:45:08 yeah but
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:45:16 it benefits more than just armour piercing
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 11:45:17 so

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:58:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:58:55 anti aircraft hwacha
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:59:59 hwacha is literally just arrow rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:11 it fires like
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:13 100+ arrows
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:19 with rocket power
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:30 its korean tech developed during the 1560s
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:39 1590s*
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:58 i have a slingshot/ballista
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:04 slingshot/ballista/crossbow
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:11 it can throw small blocks at 2600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:41 you can make armour piercing magnet guns without spamming magnets or blacklisting
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:57 by rifling the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:06 one rifling coil can pierce a half block at most
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:17 thats why i want cone cutters
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:19 so i can make ap rounds
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:43 it makes a cylinder more stable
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:52 doesnt sling it out of the barrel like  beyblade
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:05 also it creates more lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:09 so it has more range
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:13 with around the same muzzle velocity
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:53 rifling makes it nearly stud accurate
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:56 for several thousand studs
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:25 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:28 i use magnets to rifle it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:31 i put the magnets in a coil
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:46 the magnets propel it sideways and forwards
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:49 at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:51 making it spin
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:17 ok let me explain
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:27 yk how a rifling groove coils around the inside of the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:37 thats what i do
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:39 but with magnets
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:41 on the outside
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:44 they
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:46 cause it to spin
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:52 because of offbalance propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:06:07 literally just one coil of rifling
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:06:12 and a shitton of magnets for basic power
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:06:52 ok im ingame
