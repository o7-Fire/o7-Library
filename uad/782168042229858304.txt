creations-chat 2022-12-24 01:36:28 i've applied but i havent gotten a response yet
creations-chat 2022-12-24 01:41:15 funny thing is i never had shaders until i did that post, i only did it cause other ppl were doing it lmao
and i wouldnt consider shaders an exploit, just like the fps unlocker

creations-chat 2023-01-04 03:25:39 i agree
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:13:52 its not ready yet
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:16:08 ig the back is kinda ugly ngl
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:19:06 its more about the engineering and functionality
creations-chat 2023-01-12 01:22:38 ive made some changes, the footage of the car was from December
creations-chat 2023-01-12 01:39:08 they are pretty shit tbh there was a cool heli on build site 9
creations-chat 2023-01-12 01:47:32 is it still possible to apply for Inventor Rank??
creations-chat 2023-01-12 01:51:01 suggestions blacklist... what did u do 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:14:23 tbh its rlly not about the build, its more about the inventing of the camera and the website
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:17:21 literally 10 min ago opened a ticket to apply lmao, they said its unobtainable now
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:24:39 it was gonna be for the invention of the 360 camera to be fair you would need external software to compile them
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:27:11 Thats what i did for the First one But the Stitching was too complicated ++Also the images are taken inside of plane crazy but are then assembled into something called a Cubemap, which is External Software so ig ur right
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:31:55 Hall of Fame would be sick tho
Considering the Original Post got over 280 Upvotes
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:37:30 I Would Spawn the Car, go to a desired spot, stop, anchor the car, and i have each of the 6 cameras configured to a keypad key, for ex i take the photos in this order, front, left, back, right, top, bottom. This means between each facing direction, there is about a 1 second time difference between each face, so on average it takes about 6-7 seconds to take a single panorama

No Each time i want to take a shot, i have to stop the car, its not automatic like google or apple
creations-chat 2023-01-12 03:05:17 there was only like 15 or smth
creations-chat 2023-01-12 03:12:50 ok bro u have told me that like 6 times i get that the build is mid, u dont have to say it over and over to prove your point
