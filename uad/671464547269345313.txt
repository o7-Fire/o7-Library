general 2020-05-11 23:51:44 no why are you trying to keep outlines back
general 2020-05-11 23:51:52 its the gray lines on the edges of the blocks
general 2020-05-11 23:51:56 that are annoying
general 2020-05-11 23:52:51 they should make it so theres only outlines in build mode so its easier to build
general 2020-05-11 23:52:59 but then in test mode they remove them
general 2020-05-11 23:53:01 s oti looks nicer
general 2020-05-11 23:53:45 when they remove outlines and yall trying to add them back in plane crazy
general 2020-05-11 23:53:51 it should be so they're only in build mode so its easier to build
general 2020-05-11 23:54:03 but in fly mode they removed so it looks nicer

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:54:46 how do you
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:54:55 do tank treafds in a way where
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:55:02 they still move with the wheels/tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:55:06 but dont fall off of the wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:55:09 because they r loose
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:55:17 also how the fuck do you make tank treads
general 2021-08-17 00:56:17 top 10 reasons why joe mama is still funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:00:56 wheels dont move
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:00:56 but if they wedge inbetween wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:00:58 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:03:40 
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:03:44 if it follows the guidelines,
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:03:47 then yeah i'd assume
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:04:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:07:24 just make your rocket engine start off on it's side
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:07:26 and add wings on the side
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:07:33 and position it as it flies to fly upward
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:08:40 is it on wheels?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:09:01 i think it's where it doesnt collide with other wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:09:20 and other parts
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:09:37 this is actually true
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:09:43 you're probably just not using it right
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:09:59 the actual tire/wheel
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:10:02 collides with other parts?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:10:07 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:10:09 your own parts?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:11:41 if it has wings, and is able to change direction to go up/down, go sideways either directions, and turn the entire plane left or right
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:11:47 without the support of any engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:11:53 i.e propellers or orckets
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:12:14 yes

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 20:06:05 cant go 5 seconds to test it without some clown instakilling me
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 20:06:07 but it works fairly well
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 20:08:44 i did
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:02:18 STILL
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:02:21 working on lvl 2 sentry
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:02:27 this shit is a pain to stabilize

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:06:09 i will once someone fucking tells me how to stabilize it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:06:29 it can turn just fine but it constantly aims up and down
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:06:43 without me having to actually move my mouse up/down
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:07:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:07:06 the up/down aiming motors spaz out
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 22:07:14 and wont stop moving up/down repeatedly

plane-crazy 2021-10-19 21:01:19 i have a genuine question
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 21:01:27 is it just an unsaid rule to mass downvote anything in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 21:01:40 regardless of the quality
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:34:05 hypothetically if i were to submit this jet for a server role would the motorlocked rocket engines count towards part count
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:38:23 thanks for the feedback, your input will contribute to the making of this jet 🤠
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:42:25 ok, rocket in the SHAPE of a jet that rotates its wings slightly for dramatically increased maneuverability
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:07:20 i honestly have no fucking idea but it goes fast and dodges easily in pvp mode so it works for me
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:11:08 a much more visually appealing photo

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 14:52:15 so it just flies forward
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:53:04 i actually appreciate the criticism and bullying on my build; it was much deserved
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 14:54:08 https://tenor.com/view/clone-drone-in-the-danger-zone-yroue-gif-22600859
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:55:05 yeah but they were literally explaining WHY my build was shit instead of just calling it shit; that's what criticism is for, to help you (me) get better.

creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:34:57 it's barely different from basic suspensions at all. the only thing differing it is I have an unpowered motor attached to a rope on each side (with a rope down the center to try to prevent the vertical ones from dragging on the floor) it's really not that good and i could use alot of advice on how to NOT make it dogshit lol. i haven't even implemeneted turning yet lol
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:43:40 is it not allowed to? it's just a land vehicle that i'm trying to do a suspension test with
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:48:54 i wouldn't want to live in that

plane-crazy 2022-05-05 15:05:45 and i need compact rockets
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 15:06:09 i tried using just modified shredderbugs attached to disconnectors but it looked really ugly and didnt work too well
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 15:07:48 made a shredderbug, replaced the cutters with explosives and got rid of the control wings so it just moved in an up>down arc
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 15:08:13 mhm thats why i havent used that save since i first made jt
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 15:18:14 uhh probably going to have 6 rockets
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 16:56:39 that looks funny
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 16:56:43 i am laughing
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 16:56:45 very comedic
general 2022-05-05 16:56:59 be good at the game
general 2022-05-05 16:58:02 well if it is bad then it will have a very bad upvote ratio
general 2022-05-05 16:58:51 if I posted my sentry in <#384025409945337856> it would probably get downvoted into sovngarde
general 2022-05-05 17:01:08 because im not at home and the only screenshot of it i have on my phone is terrible
general 2022-05-05 17:05:35 ill put my sentry gun in <#384025409945337856> later today

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 23:37:30 i am genuinely curious is it possible to make cogwheels that can translate rotation between each other
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 23:37:48 i.e. you put a motor on one and they all spin since they're connected
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 23:38:38 without doing some goofy weird motorlock stuff
general 2022-09-02 23:41:48 i will make pc2
