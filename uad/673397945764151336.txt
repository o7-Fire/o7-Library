creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:32:26 and maybe add sails
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:32:48 and the back has some areas that look blocky
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:33:15 so use wedges or something to fill in places that look blocky
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:33:33 but the rest looks pretty good
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:34:13 yeah they look pretty good
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:35:11 you could use sparklers
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:35:17 if you have the item
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:35:46 there isn't a way to make functional flares but it would look pretty good

<@!312317260847120395> yeah... a submarine
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:58:18 yeah, a submarine what am I missing
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:59:21 looks like a submarine to me
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:00:21 pretty sure they are designed to be underwater because they have ballast tanks for going underwater<:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:10:22 something that goes below and above water is a submarine in my book
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:11:22 😎
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:12:27 in what way is it not a submarine, just because it isnt under as long doesnt mean its not a submarine, if a plane cant stay in the air very long its still a plane
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:14:33 because they arent, they arent powered
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:15:35 > a plane with an engine but cant fly far are still counted as planes
<@!447221768520859659> exactly
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:16:37 bruh I don't care what your point is, a u boat by all definitions is a sub if you look it up it is considered a sub you are just wrong
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:18:33 literally look it up they all say its a submarine
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:21:23 > <@!673397945764151336>  you are a prime example of why teachers don’t like wikipedia

creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:33:32 yeah details just mean they put in effort which means its prolly good which means you get upvotes, its not hard to understand
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:35:06 what plane is it gonna be for
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:36:09 bruh getting ranked is mad easy, its only a lil hard when you get to expert
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:38:05 no you need good builds for any expert rank because you need ten upvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:39:06 yeah but it at least equals not bad, either way a build with a difference of ten positive upvotes has to be kinda good
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:40:20 And ive seen good ones get downvotes but usually thats how it works from what ive observed but there is gonna be anomalies
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:42:00 I would go with 20 personally
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:43:19 nah thats too much
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:44:36 yeah but take into consideration the other requirements for expert
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:45:57 you need to meet the size and other stuff and the mod has to see if its low effort so a expert rank build most likely is a decent build

creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:45:12 whats wrong with putting a trans flag on a build?
creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:46:36 I didnt see the build so yeah I know see why it has downvotes <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:48:11 again I don't like the plane itself i could care less if it has a trans flag, so dont use that as a reason for downvotes, and dont accuse people for that
creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:49:17 asking for less downvotes is just as bad as asking for upvotes in my opinion, if you wanna be trans then go for it but dont say people are gona downvote for that reason when no one will
creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:52:31 It isn't that good of a jet, it's not the worse I've seen but not great, that's why it's getting downvoted no ulterior motives at all
creations-chat 2020-11-02 19:54:06 I mean I don't have a problem with people talking about it but there isnt a reason to talk about in this discord server cause its not what this server is about lol

general 2020-11-16 02:34:07 > We do not perceive water as wet bro, we perceive the OBJECT COVERED IN OR SATURATED BY WATER as wet. You don't say the water is wet, you say the floor is wet. Similarly, you don't say the light is red, you say that the object is red.

general 2020-11-30 15:32:46 well you're staff
general 2020-11-30 15:32:53 so embarrass yourself
general 2020-11-30 15:33:36 knock knock
general 2020-11-30 15:33:45 I have a suggestion that will hopefully make it so that every time you close your eyes, you don't have to weep about how terrible of a human being you are; it involves you shutting the fuck up and giving the new staff member some time to learn how staffing works rather than being a prick towards them. Your comment, and quite frankly his calm response, are precisely the reason someone like him got staff over you. If I catch you being rude towards any of my staff like that I will make sure you get banned, mark my fucking words. I have had enough of your bullshit because you did the same exact thing to me when I got recruited as junior mod, and nobody should have to deal with someone like you when they're in that position. Know your fucking place.

general 2020-12-05 07:34:57 I can hella kick in the last stretch
general 2020-12-05 07:35:31 you gotta use a roller a lot for distance
general 2020-12-05 07:36:23 oof
general 2020-12-05 07:36:25 400 sucks
general 2020-12-05 07:36:30 cause its like a sprint
general 2020-12-05 07:36:34 but a really long one
general 2020-12-05 07:37:03 yeah
general 2020-12-05 07:37:28 I did hurdles in middle school and was really good and then got to highschool and realized i was no longer good
general 2020-12-05 07:38:11 400m hurdles is prolly one of the worst events Ive ever seen
general 2020-12-05 07:38:25 cause
general 2020-12-05 07:38:38 its an awful event to do
general 2020-12-05 07:38:47 if you think the 400 is bad
general 2020-12-05 07:38:52 try the 400m hurdles
general 2020-12-05 07:39:34 yeah bro im only 8 what do you expect
general 2020-12-05 07:40:00 the mile is so hard for me I like the 2mile more
general 2020-12-05 07:40:13 I like the pace for the 32 way more
general 2020-12-05 07:40:34 I got really close to breaking 12 last year
general 2020-12-05 07:40:37 for the 32
general 2020-12-05 07:41:02 I was at like a 6:05 or something like that
general 2020-12-05 07:41:06 for my mile pace
general 2020-12-05 07:41:25 but my pace for xc is like 6:30
general 2020-12-05 07:41:51 but my xc coach isnt very bright
general 2020-12-05 07:42:05 he was the modified coach like a couple seasons ago
general 2020-12-05 07:42:13 so he treats us like children
general 2020-12-05 07:42:30 but our track coach is really good
general 2020-12-05 07:42:44 no I want a good coach
general 2020-12-05 07:43:16 theres an in-between for treating us like children and drill instructor lol
general 2020-12-05 07:43:59 but our team had 16 runners and 9 of them were seniors and we had a really good season
general 2020-12-05 07:44:10 but we lost all our seniors and we sucked this year
general 2020-12-05 07:44:28 we were like 2-6
general 2020-12-05 07:45:05 dang
general 2020-12-05 07:45:37 we do a lot of workouts at the state trail and one of the roads is at a weird angle where you cross and akid got hit by a car several years ago
general 2020-12-05 07:45:52 so now the coaches have to super annoying about it
general 2020-12-05 07:46:16 yes
general 2020-12-05 07:46:21 you are correct
general 2020-12-05 07:46:36 we have a ton of weird traditions and stuff
general 2020-12-05 07:47:04 and mud
general 2020-12-05 07:47:26 the end of the season is the worst for where I live

general 2020-12-05 07:48:49 ideal temp for distance is like 50 degrees
general 2020-12-05 07:49:26 also xc teams are nicer to eachother
general 2020-12-05 07:49:40 basketball and football has way more toxicity
general 2020-12-05 07:49:57 and even the parents like get into fights at the games
general 2020-12-05 07:50:27 but our football team was actually good at one point
general 2020-12-05 07:50:41 and injuries in football are so bad
general 2020-12-05 07:50:56 like in distance injuries just build over time
general 2020-12-05 07:51:04 but in football its just bam

general 2020-12-12 14:57:38 Ok
general 2020-12-12 14:57:56 Lol make a better game I’ll wait
general 2020-12-12 14:59:38 Yeah but like what about a better building game in roblox
general 2020-12-12 15:00:19 Yeah but babft is only good if you grind for parts or spend money
general 2020-12-12 15:00:41 Basic stuff in the game is behind hours of grinding or a paywall
general 2020-12-12 15:00:57 But in plane crazy you can just build
general 2020-12-12 15:01:10 And it has physics
general 2020-12-12 15:01:44 So more of a challenge
general 2020-12-12 15:02:08 You can make anything fly in babft if you have the plane kit
general 2020-12-12 15:02:12 Literally anything
general 2020-12-12 15:02:23 Make a giant boat but you add one rocket thing
general 2020-12-12 15:02:25 It flys
general 2020-12-12 15:04:21 Plus there a ton of ways to not play the game properly in babft
general 2020-12-12 15:04:39 AFK grinders, planes, glitches
general 2020-12-12 15:04:46 All ways to not play the game legit
general 2020-12-12 15:37:44 Im building a V-22 rn I never do terrain vehicles

general 2020-12-12 15:41:11 oh
general 2020-12-12 15:41:16 thats not as fun tho
general 2020-12-12 15:41:38 b 52 has downward ejection seats for the guys on the bottom
general 2020-12-12 15:42:05 not with enough altitude
general 2020-12-12 15:43:23 being on a bomber would be way cooler then a fighter tho
general 2020-12-12 15:43:31 you can use the bathroom on a bomber
general 2020-12-12 15:44:09 my dad told me about the b 52 bathrooms and its hard to be accurate

general 2020-12-27 02:17:46 because the mod or admin who did prolly had a good reason
general 2020-12-27 02:19:57 female staff, impossible
general 2020-12-27 02:20:21 im alive
general 2020-12-27 02:21:29 then apply
general 2020-12-27 02:21:54 idk
general 2020-12-27 02:22:05 depends how many applications
general 2020-12-27 02:22:12 which only obc knows
general 2020-12-27 02:22:24 also depends of your app is good or not

general 2020-12-27 02:25:38 dang
general 2020-12-27 02:28:16 there was around 60 by the end when I applied
general 2020-12-27 02:28:30 I wonder if this time will beat that
general 2020-12-27 02:28:54 unfortunate
general 2020-12-27 02:29:03 cant do anything about that tho
general 2020-12-27 02:32:24 priv servers are def worth it
general 2020-12-27 02:32:29 10 robux a month
general 2020-12-27 02:32:56 400 robux means 40 months worth of a priv server lol

general 2020-12-27 04:18:49 big deal
general 2020-12-27 04:19:27 just keep playing and over time you will get more upvotes on your builds
general 2020-12-27 04:19:45 it is but ok
general 2020-12-27 04:20:28 youve only been here a couple days how would you know lol
general 2020-12-27 04:20:57 exactly
general 2020-12-27 04:21:08 youve been in the server for a small amount of time
general 2020-12-27 04:22:16 your build wasnt very detailed so therefore it got downvotes
general 2020-12-27 04:22:19 pretty simple
general 2020-12-27 04:22:30 then you ask people why they dont like it
general 2020-12-27 04:22:34 they answer
general 2020-12-27 04:22:39 then you try to improve
general 2020-12-27 04:23:41 exactly

general 2020-12-27 04:25:22 so people didnt upvote it
general 2020-12-27 04:25:46 depends
general 2020-12-27 04:25:51 usually yes
general 2020-12-27 04:26:00 its hard to add detail with small size
general 2020-12-27 04:26:04 but can be done
general 2020-12-27 04:26:10 ^
general 2020-12-27 04:26:35 its hard to motorlock on small stuff tho cause you usually get exposed motors
general 2020-12-27 04:27:30 performance doesnt mean much when posting your build
general 2020-12-27 04:27:41 all people can do is judge on looks
general 2020-12-27 04:28:22 also Ive already told you
general 2020-12-27 04:28:27 Its really not that detailed
general 2020-12-27 04:29:06 yes
general 2020-12-27 04:29:08 lol
general 2020-12-27 04:30:19 yeah making a small heli is cool but people wont upvote it if it doesnt look good

general 2020-12-31 03:39:37 starting at a sprint is kinda dumb tho
general 2020-12-31 03:39:54 you start at almost a sprint but never fully one
general 2020-12-31 03:40:09 thats how you die like super fast
general 2020-12-31 03:41:03 theres a vid of me doing the smr and I just passed like 3 guys cause I carried
general 2020-12-31 03:41:22 but my mom video taped it like sideways somehow

general 2020-12-31 03:43:11 theres also a dmr distance medley relay
general 2020-12-31 03:43:19 which is smr but twice as long basically
general 2020-12-31 03:43:34 Im a nerd in everything I enjoy
general 2020-12-31 03:43:46 its how my brain works
general 2020-12-31 03:44:29 nah man if you got good spikes every step feels like running with the power of Zeus
general 2020-12-31 03:44:56 thats normal
general 2020-12-31 03:45:03 then adrenaline kicks in and you feel fine
general 2020-12-31 03:45:29 adrenaline makes you fast
general 2020-12-31 03:45:36 yeah
general 2020-12-31 03:45:47 distance spikes are a little better but still tight
general 2020-12-31 03:46:02 cross country ones are pretty comfortable tho
general 2020-12-31 03:46:13 idot
general 2020-12-31 03:46:28 yeah
general 2020-12-31 03:46:36 its all in the front of your foot
general 2020-12-31 03:46:42 thats where you need it for sprints
general 2020-12-31 03:46:58 cause its where you push off and get all the force and shit
general 2020-12-31 04:06:11 Use the dump for memes

general 2020-12-31 04:14:38 Yeah tell me or other staff
general 2020-12-31 04:14:42 It’s against the rules
general 2020-12-31 04:14:56 Not fair for other participants
general 2020-12-31 05:04:27 im used to it at this point
general 2020-12-31 05:04:47 if travis scott is an animal then yes
general 2020-12-31 05:05:03 yeah but batman is pretty cool
general 2020-12-31 05:08:50 a projection is just light

general 2020-12-31 05:14:02 I think so
general 2020-12-31 05:14:12 cause 10 robux is like a cent
general 2020-12-31 05:14:16 so do the math
general 2020-12-31 05:14:32 there was a item that got to 1 billion
general 2020-12-31 05:14:55 a kid who was sick requested a special item the ultra commando or something like that and it was the only one
general 2020-12-31 05:15:03 and then he gave it away
general 2020-12-31 05:15:16 making like 1 billion robux or something like that
general 2020-12-31 05:16:02 a lot of people

general 2021-01-04 18:52:49 his reason is he likes the art
general 2021-01-04 18:53:01 thats all there is to it
general 2021-01-04 18:53:22 my batman pfp doesnt make me batman
general 2021-01-04 18:53:31 I wish it did tho
general 2021-01-04 18:53:47 he is
general 2021-01-04 18:54:11 vigilante is a group tho
general 2021-01-04 18:54:57 youre missing my point, having a pfp doesnt make you that thing he likes the art, doesnt make him a furry
general 2021-01-04 18:55:30 well what do you define as weeb?
general 2021-01-04 18:56:00 or you could just not bully
general 2021-01-04 18:56:15 yeah but what do you define as a weeb
general 2021-01-04 18:56:52 someone who just likes anime shouldnt really be a thing, if they like it too much then I understand them being a weeb
general 2021-01-04 18:57:14 yeah and people who like anime arent that lol
general 2021-01-04 18:57:36 do you wish to be japanese?
general 2021-01-04 18:57:56 yeah the server is toxic
general 2021-01-04 18:58:24 THATS WHAT IM TRYING TO DO
general 2021-01-04 18:58:52 I didnt do slowmode my guy
general 2021-01-04 18:59:23 alright you guys keep calling blackbird furry correct?
general 2021-01-04 18:59:51 and he doesnt like it correct?
general 2021-01-04 19:00:28 you call him furry and he doesnt like it so just stop doing it pretty simple
general 2021-01-04 19:02:14 idk I just think you guys care way too much about people being furries
general 2021-01-04 19:02:42 and he obviously doesnt like being called one so stop
general 2021-01-04 19:03:53 your brother is gman
general 2021-01-04 19:04:44 no brothers share 100% DNA
general 2021-01-04 19:04:51 cause they have the same parents
general 2021-01-04 19:05:16 he'll be back

general 2021-01-07 00:01:43 well if it actually is 3k then yeah it counts
general 2021-01-07 00:02:15 when did you build that?
general 2021-01-07 00:03:10 3 hours for a build
general 2021-01-07 00:03:15 seems normal to me
general 2021-01-07 00:03:40 I plan my builds out a lot in advance tho so I dont usually take that long
general 2021-01-07 00:04:20 oh its big
general 2021-01-07 00:05:48 well if you get the upvotes and prove it drives and turns and stuff and has enough blocks
general 2021-01-07 00:05:54 then you could get expert
general 2021-01-07 00:06:16 no
general 2021-01-07 00:06:50 you have to build something made for that thing slapping wheels on something random doesnt count lol
general 2021-01-07 00:07:09 i kinda doubt that lol
general 2021-01-07 00:07:39 well her build is already almost at enough upvotes
general 2021-01-07 00:09:31 not a lot of people use expert vip

general 2021-01-07 00:16:51 the tower could use work
general 2021-01-07 00:17:06 its very basic
general 2021-01-07 00:17:17 you do
general 2021-01-07 00:17:35 you have to provide evidence
general 2021-01-07 00:18:25 you did?
general 2021-01-07 00:20:59 the nose is kinda whack but the rest is pretty good
general 2021-01-07 00:22:00 not true
general 2021-01-07 00:22:16 there are builds that arent even that big
general 2021-01-07 00:24:55 ?
general 2021-01-07 00:25:32 like almost all of the builds there are good
general 2021-01-07 00:26:17 old ones were good for the time
general 2021-01-07 00:27:31 theres only like one bad build in the hof in my opinion
general 2021-01-07 00:27:40 and thats the second one the carrier
general 2021-01-07 00:29:16 I like that build
general 2021-01-07 00:29:43 its pretty good for the time and it still holds up in my opinion
general 2021-01-07 00:29:51 it looks like an artillery
general 2021-01-07 00:30:38 like over 90% of the builds are super good
general 2021-01-07 00:32:08 nothing
general 2021-01-07 00:32:21 once you get the rank you keep it
general 2021-01-07 00:32:31 I havent
general 2021-01-07 00:32:40 no matter how bad the build I keep it
general 2021-01-07 00:32:48 for nostalgia
general 2021-01-07 00:32:58 like my really bad plane
general 2021-01-07 00:33:28 thats actually the only build that got me a rank that im not proud of

general 2021-01-07 00:34:17 that pic took me hours alone to get the right position

general 2021-01-10 23:36:08 doesnt matter it wasnt the main one
general 2021-01-10 23:36:25 yeah well I tried
general 2021-01-10 23:36:36 took me hours to get that position alone
general 2021-01-10 23:36:55 all the tie was is a prop
general 2021-01-10 23:37:02 the x wing is the main thing
general 2021-01-10 23:37:11 I did use anchors
general 2021-01-10 23:37:16 still took a while
general 2021-01-10 23:37:30 getting the guns perfectly on both sides was hard
general 2021-01-10 23:38:23 also lighting was kinda hard
general 2021-01-10 23:38:32 when I had to take it at night time
general 2021-01-10 23:38:40 wha
general 2021-01-10 23:38:52 bruh its supposed to be in space
general 2021-01-10 23:39:08 yes but space is cooler
general 2021-01-10 23:39:37 and tie fighters and x wings rarely fought in atmospheres
general 2021-01-10 23:40:02 like 70
general 2021-01-10 23:40:15 ?
general 2021-01-10 23:41:45 so short answer I didnt care much about lighting as long as the xwing was easy to see cause the xwing looked good and the tie fighter didnt
general 2021-01-10 23:43:07 I thought it was sir jackie
general 2021-01-10 23:43:26 yeah he got banned

general 2021-01-11 21:49:50 roblox is full of bad games
general 2021-01-11 21:50:06 those are on their own tho, roblox as a platform is perfectly fine

general 2021-01-13 15:52:57 I dont think british shows are necessarily bad but most good stuff is in hollywood or other places in the US
general 2021-01-13 15:53:07 and sometimes british stuff is more dry
general 2021-01-13 15:53:35 most?
general 2021-01-13 15:53:39 Id say a lot
general 2021-01-13 15:53:41 not most
general 2021-01-13 15:54:04 and also just cause they are filmed in a non american place doesnt mean the show isnt american
general 2021-01-13 15:54:45 yes cause its produced by indians
general 2021-01-13 15:54:50 idot

general 2021-01-13 16:01:54 I live in a lower populated area of ny and theres a big city pretty close by, its like that in most of ny
general 2021-01-13 16:03:54 ive been to ontario, its like new york but everything is just a lil different
general 2021-01-13 16:04:06 whos 1st

general 2021-01-13 16:05:24 thats like nothing
general 2021-01-13 16:05:30 oh dang thats not bad
general 2021-01-13 16:05:54 its good shit bro
general 2021-01-13 16:06:03 you know its good when you gotta kinda fold it
general 2021-01-13 16:06:16 exactly
general 2021-01-13 16:06:22 one of the reasons its good

general 2021-01-13 16:08:41 well they're both in Oceania aren't they?
general 2021-01-13 16:09:23 I always though australia was a continent until I learned oceania was a thing
general 2021-01-13 16:09:49 thats what I was taught bro
general 2021-01-13 16:10:02 that australia was like a continent
general 2021-01-13 16:10:24 idk but the continent is oceania
general 2021-01-13 16:10:32 kinda weird
general 2021-01-13 16:11:44 if you look it up it says both
general 2021-01-13 16:11:57 but it being a continent is like more informal
general 2021-01-13 16:12:41 it says its a continent tho wtf I need answers

general 2021-01-14 19:14:31 correct
general 2021-01-14 19:14:41 and not correct at the same time
general 2021-01-14 19:15:07 cause he joins the justice league which isnt considered vigilantism
general 2021-01-14 19:15:21 they handle big time stuff and its legal
general 2021-01-14 19:15:41 also batman kinda HAD to become a vigilante cause of the shape gotham was in

general 2021-01-14 19:17:29 batman isnt stupid
general 2021-01-14 19:17:51 you need to read batman and watch it to realize how cool of a character he is

general 2021-01-15 00:21:30 oh then that makes sense
general 2021-01-15 00:21:58 you should use center lines on the head for figures
general 2021-01-15 00:22:14 and should prolly mark out the knees too
general 2021-01-15 00:22:44 center lines on the head are very good for getting the angles right
general 2021-01-15 00:23:22 idk what that means but this has been vildebeest's art criticism
general 2021-01-15 00:24:06 you need lines marking out the eyes and down the center facing where you want your face to look
general 2021-01-15 00:25:08 like this
general 2021-01-15 00:25:22 you should

general 2021-01-17 02:04:46 yes he was raised by the league of assassins
general 2021-01-17 02:05:02 before batman took him under his wing

general 2021-01-17 07:53:49 Ive liked batman since I was like a toddler lol
general 2021-01-17 07:54:16 are you dumb
general 2021-01-17 07:54:45 bruh ever heard of justice league dark apokolips war? or all the other animated stuff
general 2021-01-17 07:55:01 and not to mention the constant comics
general 2021-01-17 07:55:09 batman is in all kids of stuff
general 2021-01-17 07:55:15 it has good reviews
general 2021-01-17 07:56:29 not even the right one
general 2021-01-17 07:56:54 bruh its literally 92% liked it
general 2021-01-17 07:57:01 with 100% rotten tomatoes
general 2021-01-17 07:57:09 and an almost 9/10 imdb
general 2021-01-17 07:57:50 how am I an antihero
general 2021-01-17 07:58:20 well that just isnt accurate lol
general 2021-01-17 07:58:31 an anti hero would like kill bad guys or something
general 2021-01-17 07:58:36 batman never kills
general 2021-01-17 07:58:51 yes
general 2021-01-17 07:58:55 like the punisher
general 2021-01-17 07:59:27 someone who isnt like that good of a person but still intends on doing right
general 2021-01-17 07:59:30 like deadpool
general 2021-01-17 07:59:32 or the punisher
general 2021-01-17 08:01:22 bruh thats one of the earliest comics lol
general 2021-01-17 08:01:37 batman has been established as a non killer
general 2021-01-17 08:01:44 he doesnt use guns or lethal weapons
general 2021-01-17 08:01:53 ?
general 2021-01-17 08:01:56 what movie thing
general 2021-01-17 08:02:12 did i not say comics in that sentence?
general 2021-01-17 08:02:26 with what
general 2021-01-17 08:02:59 basically batman doesnt kill mainly cause that would bring him down to the level of the villians
general 2021-01-17 08:03:19 hyperbit usually handles those
general 2021-01-17 08:03:34 again not really an antihero
general 2021-01-17 08:03:54 uhhh yeah?
general 2021-01-17 08:04:03 he's not tho
general 2021-01-17 08:04:33 that isnt accurate and I'll explain why
general 2021-01-17 08:05:02 just cause he uses intimidation as a tool doesnt mean he's an antihero
general 2021-01-17 08:05:16 basically
general 2021-01-17 08:05:22 a good example is deadpool
general 2021-01-17 08:05:50 batman doesnt really do anything bad he just gives off that vibe cause of how dark and brooding he is
general 2021-01-17 08:06:20 in reality all he does is catch criminals and send them to jail, what about that makes him an antihero
general 2021-01-17 08:06:43 yes
general 2021-01-17 08:06:49 I'd say cops are heroes
general 2021-01-17 08:07:11 well no
general 2021-01-17 08:07:23 they have a similar job but different methods
general 2021-01-17 08:08:15 well that isnt the only difference
general 2021-01-17 08:08:20 no
general 2021-01-17 08:08:46 overpriced? bruh he got that stuff from Lucius Fox
general 2021-01-17 08:08:56 a guy who works for wayne enterprises
general 2021-01-17 08:09:23 and he was also trained by the league of shadows depending on the comic
general 2021-01-17 08:09:48 basically he's a master of most fighting styles and has a bunch of tech
general 2021-01-17 08:10:00 <#495286269459300364>
general 2021-01-17 08:10:15 wdym no
general 2021-01-17 08:10:28 I'm gonna pretend you didnt say that
general 2021-01-17 08:10:48 how is he better
general 2021-01-17 08:11:00 if you keep doing it yes
general 2021-01-17 08:11:09 killing is wrong tho
general 2021-01-17 08:11:42 well I verbally did so any shitpost after is a warn, and if you get enough, banned
general 2021-01-17 08:11:54 ok
general 2021-01-17 08:11:58 doesnt really matter
general 2021-01-17 08:12:08 ?
general 2021-01-17 08:12:18 wdym I didnt log you
general 2021-01-17 08:12:29 I verbally said dont so if you do it again you'll get warned
general 2021-01-17 08:13:04 dude what I'm saying is if you keep shitposting EVENTUALLY it will be a ban
general 2021-01-17 08:13:20 wdym no?
general 2021-01-17 08:13:42 okay you just aren't reading what im typing
general 2021-01-17 08:14:34 yes but if you do it will
general 2021-01-17 08:14:39 is what I said
general 2021-01-17 08:14:50 how
general 2021-01-17 08:15:04 how
general 2021-01-17 08:15:11 the live action ones?
general 2021-01-17 08:15:19 yeah those are bad
general 2021-01-17 08:15:29 incorrect
general 2021-01-17 08:15:39 dark apokolips war is really good
general 2021-01-17 08:15:52 and all the others are for that matter
general 2021-01-17 08:16:03 teen titans vs justice league is good
general 2021-01-17 08:16:10 judas contract is good
general 2021-01-17 08:16:35 so basically you're saying the animated movies are bad but havent seen them
general 2021-01-17 08:16:37 cool
general 2021-01-17 08:16:50 teen titans go is
general 2021-01-17 08:17:05 but most dc fans dont accept it lol
general 2021-01-17 08:17:13 it isnt canon to anything
general 2021-01-17 08:18:23 helis are considered vtols tho
general 2021-01-17 08:18:47 how only some cases?
general 2021-01-17 08:19:50 yes but helis do all the requirements, it does a vertical takeoff, can hover, etc
general 2021-01-17 08:20:26 literally look up are helis considered vtols and you have your answer
general 2021-01-17 08:21:27 I dont think so but I dont see what that proves
general 2021-01-17 08:21:47 they have tilt tho
general 2021-01-17 08:22:03 and even if they are they still are vtols lol
general 2021-01-17 08:22:30 they vertically take off, and all the other requirements of a vtol
general 2021-01-17 08:22:53 it doesnt have to
general 2021-01-17 08:23:03 why is that a requirement lol
general 2021-01-17 08:23:38 A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft is one that can hover, take off, and land vertically. This classification can include a variety of types of aircraft including fixed-wing aircraft as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as cyclogyros/cyclocopters and tiltrotors.
general 2021-01-17 08:23:52 yeah

general 2021-01-17 08:25:39 no

the-dump 2021-01-17 10:55:58 Or games like arsenal and phantom forces

general 2021-01-18 00:06:47 well breaking bones does lead to stronger bones
general 2021-01-18 00:07:22 bruh I was lied to
general 2021-01-18 00:07:55 when I broke my bone I could see the build up around and my dad was like yeah since the bone is thicker its less likely to break
general 2021-01-18 00:08:44 This calcium collection is really strong, so, while the bone is healing there is a period when the break site is stronger than it ever has been. But, the rest of the bone surrounding the break site actually demineralizes because of inactivity (since you're probably in a cast).Apr
general 2021-01-18 00:08:48 I wouldnt know
general 2021-01-18 00:09:06 yeah I cant like see it my guy

general 2021-01-20 03:16:47 <@!322970944303923200> I'm pretty sure you shouldn't be streaming that
general 2021-01-20 03:17:02 yes but thats piracy
general 2021-01-20 03:17:37 thats like if a guy was like I cant go to jail a bunch of people have been murderers before me
general 2021-01-20 03:18:00 <@!195253906333368320> can he stream shrek here?
general 2021-01-20 03:18:17 thats not how that works lol
general 2021-01-20 03:18:46 if I bought shrek and then copied it and gave it to everyone that would be considered piracy
general 2021-01-20 03:19:10 people could screen record and stuff
general 2021-01-20 03:19:38 pretty sure its still piracy my guy
general 2021-01-20 03:20:14 okay sweet I was right
general 2021-01-20 03:20:38 how about just dont stream movies
general 2021-01-20 03:22:49 because we're better then that
general 2021-01-20 03:23:39 we wont just break discord tos because other people do it thats flawed logic
general 2021-01-20 03:23:56 people pay for movie theater tickets
general 2021-01-20 03:24:38 how
general 2021-01-20 03:26:50 which is what I said my guy
general 2021-01-20 03:27:22 I was using that to say his point was wrong lol
general 2021-01-20 03:27:41 cause he brought up how that its like a movie theater
general 2021-01-20 03:28:09 but also go ahead and research it but streaming movies is against the tos no ifs or buts
general 2021-01-20 03:28:57 if I obtained a movie via a method where I dont have to pay for it when you should have to thats piracy
general 2021-01-20 03:29:16 all of them this a multi country server
general 2021-01-20 03:29:22 thats how discord tos works
general 2021-01-20 03:29:51 bruh people could literally screen record it
general 2021-01-20 03:30:06 yes
general 2021-01-20 03:30:16 which is illegal

general 2021-01-22 23:39:21 bruh its a super famous show knowing it exists isnt weird
general 2021-01-22 23:40:00 my brother watches anime including sword art online
general 2021-01-22 23:40:14 prolly not
general 2021-01-22 23:40:35 watched sword art online in 2 days?
general 2021-01-22 23:40:51 lemme get this straight
general 2021-01-22 23:41:04 you said it was sus I recognized an anime character
general 2021-01-22 23:41:19 yet you binged the show it was from multiple times
general 2021-01-22 23:41:50 so I'm the sus one
general 2021-01-22 23:41:52 makes sense
general 2021-01-22 23:42:14 also I dont judge anime watchers but sao just isnt that good lol
general 2021-01-22 23:42:41 I saw a couple episodes with my brother and its bad
general 2021-01-22 23:42:57 his sister liked him bro
general 2021-01-22 23:43:07 thats just weird
general 2021-01-22 23:43:15 no its the first
general 2021-01-22 23:43:44 and the show was covered in plot armor
general 2021-01-22 23:43:58 wait kirito you're alive? how?
general 2021-01-22 23:44:01 because
general 2021-01-22 23:44:48 ive never seen the second season and only a couple of the first
general 2021-01-22 23:45:17 no truth
general 2021-01-22 23:45:31 Ive seen like 5 episodes max
general 2021-01-22 23:46:03 the same way literally every conversation happens lol
general 2021-01-22 23:46:08 what
general 2021-01-22 23:47:12 but yeah in the few episodes I saw I didnt enjoy cause the plot is whack and the writers were kinda just taking the easy way out
general 2021-01-22 23:49:17 ?
general 2021-01-22 23:49:28 how
general 2021-01-22 23:49:59 apple commercial
general 2021-01-22 23:50:15 then the person comes and throws the hammer at it
general 2021-01-22 23:50:48 welp imma go watch teen titans now
general 2021-01-22 23:51:05 the old one
general 2021-01-22 23:51:16 you mean titans?
general 2021-01-22 23:51:24 you should
general 2021-01-22 23:51:37 the live action one isnt that great I agree
general 2021-01-22 23:51:54 they made them way too old and the characters are like different in a bad way
general 2021-01-22 23:52:35 like robin became nightwing when he was 19, but in titans the actor is like in his 30s
general 2021-01-22 23:52:39 just doesnt work
general 2021-01-22 23:53:16 a rule for watching dc is always have high expectations for the animated stuff, and low for the live action stuff
general 2021-01-22 23:53:29 and in the middle for the comics
general 2021-01-22 23:53:57 you are super wrong
general 2021-01-22 23:54:10 if youve seen both you could easily see the difference
general 2021-01-22 23:54:38 marvel comics arent as good as the dc ones in my opinion
general 2021-01-22 23:55:03 well those are cars, they are the same mostly
general 2021-01-22 23:55:19 Ive read some canadian comics and they were decent
general 2021-01-22 23:55:25 yes
general 2021-01-22 23:55:49 just get american comics
general 2021-01-22 23:56:00 what is that
general 2021-01-22 23:56:28 yeah but *what* is it
general 2021-01-22 23:56:59 yeah that sounds whack
general 2021-01-22 23:57:22 hold up lemme find the canadian comic I read
general 2021-01-22 23:57:31 nah that sounds awesome
general 2021-01-22 23:59:34 US is the powerhouse for comics
general 2021-01-22 23:59:52 still is
general 2021-01-22 23:59:53 I read this when I was younger but I remember it being good
general 2021-01-23 00:00:26 idk lol
general 2021-01-23 00:00:41 yeah having one makes you an easy target
general 2021-01-23 00:01:01 but I mean america does the same thing
general 2021-01-23 00:01:10 like captain america
general 2021-01-23 00:01:18 or iron patriot
general 2021-01-23 00:01:31 even superman kinda does that
general 2021-01-23 00:01:38 true
general 2021-01-23 00:01:57 but all the comic book company powerhouses were based in the US
general 2021-01-23 00:02:22 can you stop posting then deleting that picture
general 2021-01-23 00:03:08 marvel and dc were both founded in the us
general 2021-01-23 00:03:52 the only other super mainstream company is dark horse comics but they also started in the US I think
general 2021-01-23 00:08:34 wings are too long
general 2021-01-23 00:15:46 no
general 2021-01-23 00:15:58 it's plagiarism
general 2021-01-23 00:16:05 which is against discord tos
general 2021-01-23 00:18:30 yeah well they weren't supposed too

general 2021-01-23 01:04:35 so cute bro
general 2021-01-23 01:05:19 Raccoons, like cats, have an amazing ability to land on their feet. In fact, it's speculated that raccoons can survive falling out of trees so long as they don't break a limb. They have even been documented walking off as much as a 40 meter drop (that's more than 130 feet!) with no adverse effects.
general 2021-01-23 01:05:52 their ribs are all bendy its weird

general 2021-01-24 03:44:09 Whole corn, like you eat on the cob, is considered a vegetable. The corn kernel itself (where popcorn comes from) is considered a grain. To be more specific, this form of corn is a “whole” grain. To complicate things a little more, many grains including popcorn are considered to be a fruit.

general 2021-01-24 22:48:58 well my dog has bit some people cause it thought I was being attacked
general 2021-01-24 22:49:18 your dog maybe
general 2021-01-24 22:49:48 but dogs are naturally loyal its why they are such good pets and they listen and stuff unlike cats
general 2021-01-24 22:50:21 then train your dog and do the snip snip thing

general 2021-01-25 00:18:37 0bcpro99
general 2021-01-25 00:19:17 you act like people listen to that law tho
general 2021-01-25 00:19:39 so many underage people drink the law doesnt even matter
general 2021-01-25 00:20:14 my iq is the number of foes Ive defeated in combat
general 2021-01-25 00:20:24 400
general 2021-01-25 00:20:58 no
general 2021-01-25 00:21:05 im the smartest person in the world
general 2021-01-25 00:21:50 hi taren
or should I say taren!!
general 2021-01-25 00:22:09 not my name
general 2021-01-25 00:22:11 but okay
general 2021-01-25 00:22:29 you are wrong
but thats okay
general 2021-01-25 00:25:29 where did the princess come from?
general 2021-01-25 00:26:11 I mean I wouldnt be opposed if people started calling me King Vilde but whatever
general 2021-01-25 00:26:26 what
general 2021-01-25 00:26:28 why
general 2021-01-25 00:26:33 NO KING
general 2021-01-25 00:26:54 fonkl isnt king hes just a dictator
general 2021-01-25 00:27:15 king doesnt mean dictator necessarily
general 2021-01-25 00:28:02 Kings and emperors often use force and fear too, but usually they are not called dictators. This is because those monarchs have some reason for being in power (usually their father was king or emperor), but a dictator gained power himself.
general 2021-01-25 00:28:10 thats not how that works lol
general 2021-01-25 00:28:25 look it up
general 2021-01-25 00:28:46 yeah hereditary power doesnt make you a dictator lol
general 2021-01-25 00:29:54 you do realize funny german mustache man was elected right?
general 2021-01-25 00:30:11 he was a dictator...
general 2021-01-25 00:30:44 not how that works lol
general 2021-01-25 00:31:43 a ruler with total power over a country, typically one who has obtained control by force.
thats the definition but the key word *typically*
general 2021-01-25 00:32:22 also no gross
general 2021-01-25 00:32:40 you need context for that lol

general 2021-01-26 17:09:42 ok now you guys are just posting a bunch of memes
general 2021-01-26 17:10:33 thats slang, not an actual definition

general 2021-01-26 17:11:53 no, def most

general 2021-01-26 17:20:24 god damn rooms
general 2021-01-26 17:21:09 I dont need a headphone jack, I have airpods
general 2021-01-26 17:21:32 have you had a pair?
general 2021-01-26 17:21:46 cause Ive had mine for like almost 2 years and they are great

general 2021-01-26 17:22:37 and they work really well
general 2021-01-26 17:23:05 they work super well and the bluetooth is super easy
general 2021-01-26 17:23:45 you can use a pill thing
general 2021-01-26 17:24:04 yeah you plug it in and then it has two ports
general 2021-01-26 17:24:12 a pill thing
general 2021-01-26 17:24:18 yeah that
general 2021-01-26 17:24:54 cause the design of the phone cant really fit a headphone jack very well
general 2021-01-26 17:25:28 thin is good, thin feels nice in pocket
general 2021-01-26 17:26:49 its really not that small
general 2021-01-26 17:27:03 cause it fits in your pocket better
general 2021-01-26 17:27:12 well?
general 2021-01-26 17:27:45 yeah that doesnt make sense at all lol
general 2021-01-26 17:28:17 its called a case

general 2021-01-26 17:30:30 Ive had this otterbox since I bought it and its great
general 2021-01-26 17:31:00 okay this explanation is already whack

general 2021-01-26 17:32:42 the size is a preference
general 2021-01-26 17:32:46 doesnt mean its worse

general 2021-01-28 18:49:33 ew
general 2021-01-28 18:49:45 bruh disney fucked up star wars so bad
general 2021-01-28 18:49:54 except mandalorian that was good
general 2021-01-28 18:50:14 yeah... star wars
general 2021-01-28 18:50:30 literally all the disney star wars movies are bad lol
general 2021-01-28 18:50:44 some are sorta bad and others are really bad
general 2021-01-28 18:51:06 but mandalorian is really good so they still have potential
general 2021-01-28 18:51:49 a lot of people did because it was bringing star wars back after a bunch of years
general 2021-01-28 18:52:03 it wasnt the worst thing ever, but it still wasnt that good
general 2021-01-28 18:52:31 disney did good with avengers tho so ig they can have some credit
general 2021-01-28 18:53:47 thats the thing with star wars, its similar to dc in many ways, the blockbuster stuff is always dogshit at least recently it has been, but the novels/comics and side stuff, are really good
general 2021-01-28 18:54:42 yes
general 2021-01-28 18:54:48 how am I wrong
general 2021-01-28 18:55:12 accurate doesnt mean good lol
general 2021-01-28 18:55:44 yeah the new stuff thats what I said in that message
general 2021-01-28 18:56:07 yeah but I think overall the books are decent
general 2021-01-28 18:56:51 yeah so you can watch the show for that and not worry about people watching for baby yoda
general 2021-01-28 18:57:16 classic disney yes
general 2021-01-28 18:57:22 by that I mean garbage
general 2021-01-28 18:57:46 well yeah thats sorta what they hinted at for like the entire season lol
general 2021-01-28 18:58:19 only watch once tho
general 2021-01-28 18:58:26 twice is too much
general 2021-01-28 18:59:09 ratings are pretty good indicators most of the time but theres some times where they just arent good
general 2021-01-28 18:59:26 like when they gave son of batman a 62% which is straight up bullshit
general 2021-01-28 18:59:48 true lol
general 2021-01-28 19:03:12 but what disney did to star wars is nothing comapred to what zack snyder did to dc

general 2021-01-30 16:09:45 wait send me a pic of one if you're stuck on it I'm decent at math
general 2021-01-30 16:10:06 I meant like a problem he has to do
general 2021-01-30 16:10:09 not a google result
general 2021-01-30 16:10:19 yes
general 2021-01-30 16:10:30 obc gave me a math lesson yesterday
general 2021-01-30 16:11:01 oh that
general 2021-01-30 16:11:10 seems like he already has an answer
general 2021-01-30 16:11:40 if you wanna make sure its right theres this thing called like mathpapa or something you can use
general 2021-01-30 16:11:48 pcc math class
general 2021-01-30 16:12:19 ah 8th grade, seems like a lifetime ago, I was a mere child
general 2021-01-30 16:12:43 yes a slightly larger child
general 2021-01-30 16:14:03 most likely a bat
general 2021-01-30 16:14:16 so not a rodent
general 2021-01-30 16:14:17 smh
general 2021-01-30 16:15:18 no
general 2021-01-30 16:15:36 bats are epic
general 2021-01-30 16:15:40 yes
general 2021-01-30 16:15:46 they have built in sonar
general 2021-01-30 16:15:49 and can fly
general 2021-01-30 16:15:51 epic
general 2021-01-30 16:16:10 nah they are way cooler than rats
general 2021-01-30 16:16:18 do rats have built in sonar?
general 2021-01-30 16:16:21 I dont think so
general 2021-01-30 16:16:41 incorrect
general 2021-01-30 16:16:51 rodents cant use noise to see things
general 2021-01-30 16:17:10 bats arent blind
general 2021-01-30 16:17:16 they have decent vision actually
general 2021-01-30 16:17:43 not really
general 2021-01-30 16:17:53 bats can see fine just better in the dark
general 2021-01-30 16:18:13 Bats are not blind and can in fact see quite well using their eyes. ... Bats use their good hearing to find food in the dark of night, and their good eyes to find food during the light of day. The vision of bats is tuned to low-light conditions such as is present during dawn and dusk
general 2021-01-30 16:18:54 yes if its pitch black they use their hearing
general 2021-01-30 16:19:11 what did I just say?
general 2021-01-30 16:19:35 closer to sonar
general 2021-01-30 16:19:38 I think
general 2021-01-30 16:20:15 bats have good sight in low light conditions, if its pitch black they use hearing
general 2021-01-30 16:20:48 pov: shitpost in <#497142796961054721>
general 2021-01-30 16:22:23 if you trained a bat no one would mess with you cause most people are scared of them
general 2021-01-30 16:22:42 basically
general 2021-01-30 16:22:55 batman can summon bats so thats one step to get there
general 2021-01-30 16:23:18 no
general 2021-01-30 16:23:27 he summons them with technology
general 2021-01-30 16:23:41 he plays a frequency only bats can hear
general 2021-01-30 16:23:47 and then they pull up
general 2021-01-30 16:24:21 batman does literally everything with technology

general 2021-01-30 18:00:48 it was joke
general 2021-01-30 18:00:54 I dont need it to be explained to me
general 2021-01-30 18:01:08 it really was
general 2021-01-30 18:01:25 lying*
general 2021-01-30 18:01:55 who uses roblox chat
general 2021-01-30 18:02:35 you guys talking about shirts?
why
general 2021-01-30 18:02:57 ah
general 2021-01-30 18:03:01 my avatar is epic
general 2021-01-30 18:03:12 look at it
general 2021-01-30 18:03:18 I think its pretty sick
general 2021-01-30 18:03:41 not even capping look at it
general 2021-01-30 18:04:12 I said my avatar was sick and then you said lie
so I said look at it
general 2021-01-30 18:05:05 cap means a lie
general 2021-01-30 18:05:24 if I said "you're capping"
that means you're lying
general 2021-01-30 18:05:37 really?
general 2021-01-30 18:05:42 pretty common slang
general 2021-01-30 18:05:55 not really a tiktok thing
general 2021-01-30 18:05:57 its just slang
general 2021-01-30 18:06:39 No cap." The phrase was popularized back in 2017 when Atlanta-based rappers Young Thug & Future released a track called "No Cap," where they rap about their cars and jewelry, among other things.
general 2021-01-30 18:06:44 you are incorrect my friend
general 2021-01-30 18:07:09 you dont have to listen to the music to use the slang
general 2021-01-30 18:07:18 also taste in music is subjective
general 2021-01-30 18:07:33 okay?
general 2021-01-30 18:07:34 and?
general 2021-01-30 18:07:45 I was teaching you
general 2021-01-30 18:08:03 but lead sidetracked me with tiktok
general 2021-01-30 18:08:32 well thats just cause that person is lame
general 2021-01-30 18:08:51 doesnt mean the term itself is lame all it is, is just another way to say lie
general 2021-01-30 18:09:21 what?
general 2021-01-30 18:09:25 what cringe context
general 2021-01-30 18:09:33 the context is if someone lies
general 2021-01-30 18:09:42 or if you are saying the truth
general 2021-01-30 18:10:02 I hear people my age and older say it all the time
general 2021-01-30 18:10:10 also thats cause you are a 13 year old
general 2021-01-30 18:10:23 so ofc you are surrounded by 13 year olds
general 2021-01-30 18:10:44 the reason you are saying this is cause you are surrounded by people your age
general 2021-01-30 18:11:33 also your experience doesnt equate to all the other experiences
general 2021-01-30 18:11:54 for you maybe
general 2021-01-30 18:12:18 cringe can be a fact
general 2021-01-30 18:12:23 like amy schumer
general 2021-01-30 18:12:31 it is a fact that she is cringe
general 2021-01-30 18:13:21 nah amy schumer being cringe is easily a fact
general 2021-01-30 18:13:35 no it was amy schumer this time
general 2021-01-30 18:13:58 a "comedian"
general 2021-01-30 18:14:40 theres funny women comedians
general 2021-01-30 18:14:45 amy schumer just isnt one of them
general 2021-01-30 18:14:50 tina fey is funny
general 2021-01-30 18:14:53 so is joan rivers

general 2021-01-31 02:52:24 for starters I have swag
general 2021-01-31 02:52:26 no
general 2021-01-31 02:52:34 obc doesnt even like batman
general 2021-01-31 02:52:45 he told me he liked iron man better
general 2021-01-31 02:53:09 iron man is way less cool than iron man
general 2021-01-31 02:53:46 he failed tho
general 2021-01-31 02:53:49 so he didnt
general 2021-01-31 02:53:52 gottem
general 2021-01-31 02:54:21 if thanos fixed overpopulation then why is there still the same population in the mcu?
general 2021-01-31 02:54:39 cause thanos couldnt even beat some random heroes with literal god like powers
general 2021-01-31 02:55:08 you know how many times the justice league has saved the universe?
general 2021-01-31 02:55:17 well yeah
general 2021-01-31 02:55:22 but with way less power
general 2021-01-31 02:55:28 are you dumb?
general 2021-01-31 02:55:43 you are def dumb
general 2021-01-31 02:55:54 wonder woman isnt cool?
general 2021-01-31 02:55:59 green lantern isnt cool?
general 2021-01-31 02:56:33 as someone who reads the comics I can state that most of the characters are pretty cool
general 2021-01-31 02:56:50 see its cool
general 2021-01-31 02:57:00 no its detective comics smg
general 2021-01-31 02:57:07 in the live action ones maybe
general 2021-01-31 02:57:12 but everything else nope
general 2021-01-31 02:57:50 bruh dc fights are awesome literally watch any dc animated thing
general 2021-01-31 02:58:04 WHAT
general 2021-01-31 02:58:13 DID YOU SAY TEEN TITANS IS BAD?
general 2021-01-31 02:58:19 FUCK YOU
general 2021-01-31 02:58:20 LEAVE
general 2021-01-31 02:58:26 bruh
general 2021-01-31 02:58:30 you said teen titans
general 2021-01-31 02:58:45 you literally said teen titans my guy
general 2021-01-31 02:58:51 ^
general 2021-01-31 02:59:11 anime of teen titans go is just the og one lol
general 2021-01-31 02:59:19 did you?
general 2021-01-31 02:59:32 the og one was inspired by anime
general 2021-01-31 03:00:25 if you actually read the comics and watched all the stuff and saw all the characters together you would realize dc has way more then just batman
general 2021-01-31 03:00:43 yes
general 2021-01-31 03:00:54 one of my favorites
general 2021-01-31 03:01:13 the flash is also very cool
general 2021-01-31 03:01:24 the gl movie was bad tho so
general 2021-01-31 03:01:39 dc fails in live action
general 2021-01-31 03:01:46 but picks it up in other areas
general 2021-01-31 03:01:57 the comics
general 2021-01-31 03:02:00 the animated stuff
general 2021-01-31 03:02:28 well marvel also has a bunch of characters people dont know about which is a missed opportunity
general 2021-01-31 03:02:34 like moon knight
general 2021-01-31 03:02:36 hes cool
general 2021-01-31 03:02:42 but not in any movies really
general 2021-01-31 03:02:59 in the movies?
general 2021-01-31 03:03:09 wrong
general 2021-01-31 03:03:19 its also about the comics and tv shows
general 2021-01-31 03:03:30 and dc EASILY has better shows like young justice
general 2021-01-31 03:03:48 hes marvel but kinda a dc ripoff
general 2021-01-31 03:04:11 deadpool's name is wade wilson 
wanna know what deathsroke's name is?
general 2021-01-31 03:04:16 SLADE WILSON
general 2021-01-31 03:04:18 bruh
general 2021-01-31 03:04:50 ever heard of the new 52 animated dc series
general 2021-01-31 03:04:57 an established movie series
general 2021-01-31 03:05:06 slow?
general 2021-01-31 03:05:40 bruh it started in 2013 and ended in 2020 way shorter than the mcu is rn
general 2021-01-31 03:05:45 how is that slow?
general 2021-01-31 03:06:23 look at the comics and the animated stuff and you would know
you didnt even know if deadpool was marvel was dc or not youre uneducated
general 2021-01-31 03:06:41 Im not pissed
general 2021-01-31 03:06:51 im explaining how you are wrong in every way
general 2021-01-31 03:07:24 have you seen the new 52 reboot animated ones?
general 2021-01-31 03:07:36 well try them
general 2021-01-31 03:07:45 only live action doesnt account for all of dc
general 2021-01-31 03:08:50 i just dont like debating when people dont know enough about the subject
general 2021-01-31 03:09:24 nono
general 2021-01-31 03:09:26 debate
general 2021-01-31 03:09:54 plus me arguing about comics is inevitable cause every day someone tells me "dc bad"
general 2021-01-31 03:10:33 plus dc has a more devoted fanbase cause a lot of marvel fans just like the movies
general 2021-01-31 03:11:09 you brought up the argument by saying dc is bad
general 2021-01-31 03:11:31 are you
serious?
general 2021-01-31 03:11:37 batman has so much tech
general 2021-01-31 03:12:02 also marvel going for tech doesnt make it better just different
general 2021-01-31 03:12:18 dc is more about the super powers and stuff and thats okay
general 2021-01-31 03:13:17 plus when captain marvel was literally running with the gauntlet why didnt she just do the snap?
general 2021-01-31 03:13:43 yeah
general 2021-01-31 03:13:49 and plus no more captain marvel
general 2021-01-31 03:13:51 double win
general 2021-01-31 03:14:00 ^
general 2021-01-31 03:14:20 yeah but she still couldve died
general 2021-01-31 03:14:26 we wouldnt know
general 2021-01-31 03:14:29 unless she did it
general 2021-01-31 03:14:46 im not
general 2021-01-31 03:14:56 okay but is there proof she would live?
general 2021-01-31 03:14:57 no
general 2021-01-31 03:15:24 I can be if I feel like it but usually not
general 2021-01-31 03:15:38 everyone is gonna die
general 2021-01-31 03:15:42 thats how that works
general 2021-01-31 03:16:00 also this
general 2021-01-31 03:16:08 I hate that scene so much
general 2021-01-31 03:16:16 starlord
general 2021-01-31 03:16:27 cause thanos killed gamora
general 2021-01-31 03:16:31 and he got mad
general 2021-01-31 03:16:51 which made me mad cause star lord is one of my favorite characters
general 2021-01-31 03:17:43 I feel like batman could win considering he beat superman before
general 2021-01-31 03:17:59 what
general 2021-01-31 03:18:01 how
general 2021-01-31 03:18:40 yes but batman is smarter I feel like
general 2021-01-31 03:19:09 they made tony stark like smart but they over did it
like whoa guys just figured out time travel ez
general 2021-01-31 03:19:15 whoa new element ez
general 2021-01-31 03:19:58 batman has a bunch of tech and his actual fighting skill outlaps iron man's many times
general 2021-01-31 03:20:24 batman with his gear you mean?
general 2021-01-31 03:20:31 batman has made suits too
general 2021-01-31 03:21:01 also how tf did tony stark just make that many suits in that amount of time makes no sense at all
general 2021-01-31 03:21:21 I know comics better than you my guy
general 2021-01-31 03:22:19 tony stark would win cause his character arch is im smart and I can do everything super easily
general 2021-01-31 03:22:56 but also tony stark lost to fucking captain america
general 2021-01-31 03:23:42 yeah but when it came down to the two of them he got his ass handed too him
general 2021-01-31 03:23:55 oh true
general 2021-01-31 03:24:05 I forgot about the hell bat armor
general 2021-01-31 03:24:13 yeah iron man would get fucked up by that
general 2021-01-31 03:24:25 no question
general 2021-01-31 03:24:36 which one?
general 2021-01-31 03:24:58 the hellbat armor?
general 2021-01-31 03:25:13 and then he died
general 2021-01-31 03:25:18 not very impressive
general 2021-01-31 03:25:27 I could die not that hard
general 2021-01-31 03:25:39 oh lol
general 2021-01-31 03:26:00 hellbat armor>iron man armor
general 2021-01-31 03:26:10 lemme get a list
general 2021-01-31 03:26:12 one sec
general 2021-01-31 03:27:15 no it was for darkseid
general 2021-01-31 03:27:51 cause the apokolips planet is a hard place to survive with no super powers
general 2021-01-31 03:28:29 plus thers a movie about the avengers basically being terrorists just saying
general 2021-01-31 03:29:14 scarlet witch was just like lemme murder some innocent people rq
general 2021-01-31 03:29:37 not batman, batman NEVER kills
general 2021-01-31 03:29:59 he kills in like alternate reality stuff
general 2021-01-31 03:30:31 batman's entire ark is that he doest kill because his family was taken from him and that he puts life above everything
general 2021-01-31 03:30:47 the live action movies dont count cause zack snyder is a dumbass
general 2021-01-31 03:31:11 zack snyder is an awful director lol
general 2021-01-31 03:31:31 where am I wrong?
general 2021-01-31 03:31:51 yeah thats true, which is why the joker movie was so cool
general 2021-01-31 03:32:21 ok?
some random youtube comment
general 2021-01-31 03:32:29 or tweet
general 2021-01-31 03:32:34 whatever that is

general 2021-01-31 03:33:48 doesnt kill tho
general 2021-01-31 03:34:03 in a video game

general 2021-01-31 03:35:06 uhhhh
general 2021-01-31 03:35:17 your using random game clips and memes lol
general 2021-01-31 03:35:32 not really my point is still valid
general 2021-01-31 03:35:45 no I dont need mod abuse
general 2021-01-31 03:36:19 batman doesnt kill that point is still very valid
general 2021-01-31 03:36:30 my mom is a therapist
general 2021-01-31 03:36:33 and my brother
general 2021-01-31 03:36:38 and soon my other brother

general 2021-01-31 03:37:37 see what happens
general 2021-01-31 03:38:17 I mean yeah batman might cripple someone but he wont kill them
general 2021-01-31 03:38:35 marvel does that even more then the dc movies lol
general 2021-01-31 03:38:59 well like usually he doesnt but he has killed like darkseid out of necessity
general 2021-01-31 03:39:13 ?
general 2021-01-31 03:39:18 okay?
general 2021-01-31 03:39:21 okay?
general 2021-01-31 03:39:35 yeah ik
general 2021-01-31 03:39:42 but he kinda had to kill darkseid
general 2021-01-31 03:39:55 cause he was trying to conquer the universe
general 2021-01-31 03:40:18 not really
general 2021-01-31 03:40:38 theres been very few occasions superman has killed someone
general 2021-01-31 03:40:56 well then admit defeat

general 2021-01-31 03:58:07 I mean the fact that it transforms bumps it up some points at least
general 2021-01-31 03:59:43 he meant in game
general 2021-01-31 03:59:49 theres a picture mode in game
general 2021-01-31 03:59:55 that removes the hud
general 2021-01-31 04:00:16 I dont use it usually tho cause I just crop it out anyway
general 2021-01-31 04:00:32 no it should work for mobile

general 2021-01-31 04:06:19 i dont like getting older and watching movies I used to like and then realizing they were bad
general 2021-01-31 04:07:06 when I watched batman vs superman when I was 11 in theaters with my dad, epic memeory I rewatch it, its dogshit
general 2021-01-31 04:09:13 iron man is cool but when you actually think about all the suits he made, like how long did that take exactly?

general 2021-01-31 20:07:11 it glides
general 2021-01-31 20:07:24 what about gilde do you not understand
general 2021-01-31 20:07:49 its a fake fabric but when you run a current through it goes into its like gliding state
general 2021-01-31 20:08:17 and batman has electricity run from his hand so when he puts it on his cape he does the glide
general 2021-01-31 20:08:25 https://tenor.com/view/michael-keaton-batman-returns-bruce-wayne-batman-ls-comic-girl-gif-19459052

general 2021-02-01 22:52:22 gotham by gaslight is really good
general 2021-02-01 22:52:29 its about gotham in like the 1800s
general 2021-02-01 22:52:48 the other one is a classic tho
general 2021-02-01 22:52:58 but you would like the gaslight story better
general 2021-02-01 22:53:07 the old comics arent as complex
general 2021-02-01 22:53:16 its just robin and batman punching people mostly
general 2021-02-01 22:53:34 the gotham by gaslight would be my choice <@!437078588701933568>

general 2021-02-02 17:25:36 pretty sure the clock stops at 12
general 2021-02-02 17:25:38 smh
general 2021-02-02 17:27:06 the only reason miltary time is a thing is to avoid confusion between am and pm
general 2021-02-02 17:27:41 yeah well in the winter for me it gets dark at like 4 pm
general 2021-02-02 17:27:52 I like arcade
general 2021-02-02 17:28:32 well the 24 hour format was invented then yes
general 2021-02-02 17:28:53 Im aware
general 2021-02-02 17:29:26 i was just saying calling it military time is like weird cause it was called military time much later on
general 2021-02-02 17:29:33 ^
general 2021-02-02 17:30:25 well it isnt default for some countries but other countries use it
general 2021-02-02 17:30:32 its not very common in the US
general 2021-02-02 17:30:41 unless you are in the military lol
general 2021-02-02 17:30:51 yes
general 2021-02-02 17:31:09 who said that
general 2021-02-02 17:31:23 all I said was some countries use it and some dont
general 2021-02-02 17:32:01 yeah default is dependent on different factors
general 2021-02-02 17:32:16 so therefore a definitive default doesnt exist
general 2021-02-02 17:32:21 so civilman wins
general 2021-02-02 17:32:43 gg no re
general 2021-02-02 17:33:17 well he has creations blacklist so

general 2021-02-02 17:35:27 wanna ride on my broat?
general 2021-02-02 17:35:43 it isnt default hes right
general 2021-02-02 17:35:48 there is no default
general 2021-02-02 17:35:54 its all dependent on the area
general 2021-02-02 17:36:22 civil wins again
general 2021-02-02 17:36:24 gg no re
general 2021-02-02 17:36:39 no rematch
general 2021-02-02 17:36:50 I use it ironically so im 11
general 2021-02-02 17:38:05 the default is regionally limited cause in the context of the argument he was talking about the clock
general 2021-02-02 17:38:19 and in different regions they use different clocks
general 2021-02-02 17:38:33 well thats what we are talking about so
general 2021-02-02 17:38:37 thats how it started
general 2021-02-02 17:39:05 lead you are switching how the convo started to fit your case lol
general 2021-02-02 17:39:26 we are talking about the clock default the guy had
general 2021-02-02 17:39:33 not whatever youre talking about
general 2021-02-02 17:40:05 clocks
general 2021-02-02 17:40:29 lead using names looks bad for your case js
general 2021-02-02 17:40:41 a man should debate with honor and discipline
general 2021-02-02 17:41:05 but that defeats the purpose of the debate
general 2021-02-02 17:41:20 by saying you shouldnt call people names?
general 2021-02-02 17:41:34 tru
general 2021-02-02 17:41:48 lol "ment"

general 2021-02-05 15:54:27 bro how do you even get builds on there?
general 2021-02-05 16:53:05 ok and?
general 2021-02-05 16:53:57 I literally always do verbal warns
general 2021-02-05 16:54:42 and the only reason its related to the convo is because it has furries in it
general 2021-02-05 16:55:30 I just dont get why you guys spend so much time worrying about a group of people that dont mess with you in any way
general 2021-02-05 16:56:36 I've literally never had issues with a furry so I like to practice minding my own business, if a dude is happy wearing fur suits then why should I care?
general 2021-02-05 16:57:19 actually most people seem to not come into contact with furries that often so like
general 2021-02-05 16:57:34 cause you let them
general 2021-02-05 16:58:11 furries dont affect me that much cause I dont care, if they are that much of a problem for you maybe you should try not caring
general 2021-02-05 16:58:45 yeah sometimes but not often
general 2021-02-05 16:59:03 I've learned to not care what people do
general 2021-02-05 16:59:15 yes
general 2021-02-05 16:59:21 well you can laugh
general 2021-02-05 16:59:24 cause its funny
general 2021-02-05 16:59:48 well sorry your school is 90% furries somehow but most schools arent like that
general 2021-02-05 17:00:19 then dont talk to them
general 2021-02-05 17:00:56 again, that sounds like a your school thing
general 2021-02-05 17:01:24 apparently furries are the number one issue with most people
general 2021-02-05 17:01:39 that was a joke
general 2021-02-05 17:03:59 then your issue isnt with furries its with annoying people
general 2021-02-05 17:04:48 you said you dont care if they wear costumes and stuff, which is what makes them furries, but if they are annoying it bothers you, so your issue isnt with furries as a concept but just annoying people
general 2021-02-05 17:05:35 yes exactly, they are annoying because they are annoying thats all there is to it
general 2021-02-05 17:05:49 you cant hate all furries if thats your reasoning
general 2021-02-05 17:06:03 idk man, you tell me
general 2021-02-05 17:06:34 yeah pretty much
general 2021-02-05 17:07:14 also whether you guys like it or not furries are in this server, and I try to limit as much toxicity as I can
general 2021-02-05 17:07:53 well considering toxicity is a rule you prolly should
general 2021-02-05 17:08:32 I read it right, you phrased it wrong
general 2021-02-05 17:10:44 you see if you get banned 3 times thats that
general 2021-02-05 17:10:48 thats just the rule
general 2021-02-05 17:10:56 and we like to follow rules here at pcc

general 2021-02-11 19:31:16 omg guys wouldn't we be so funny and quirky if we just danced while the teacher left
general 2021-02-11 19:31:54 to the same song the same way, that everyone else have done, then a new dance happens, and we repeat
general 2021-02-11 19:32:38 so basically to sum up this discussion 
tiktok bad and I'm right
taren is wrong
general 2021-02-11 19:33:25 yes there is very few things good on it, but it's not enough for me to redownload the app
general 2021-02-11 19:33:59 well I wanted to see if like there was good comedians on it but there isn't
general 2021-02-11 19:34:24 they both suck
general 2021-02-11 19:35:14 titktok caused this shit so what other reasons do you need for it to be bad
general 2021-02-11 19:36:03 these motherfuckers filled the skate park and they just sat around and took up space
general 2021-02-11 19:36:35 they didn't even skate they just were there
general 2021-02-11 19:37:28 oh you wanna do something on the manual pad? well you can't because theres an eboy vaping there
general 2021-02-11 19:38:12 I hate you
general 2021-02-11 19:38:15 leave
general 2021-02-11 19:38:49 every person at my school that I have had issues with vape, its not a coincidence
general 2021-02-11 19:39:12 cats are alright ig
general 2021-02-11 19:39:59 dogs are loyal protectors, cats are bipolar creatures that only care about themselves
general 2021-02-11 19:40:27 a person attacks you whos gonna help the dog or cat?
general 2021-02-11 19:40:32 dogs win
general 2021-02-11 19:40:46 then give it a bath
general 2021-02-11 19:41:04 my dog doesnt smell cause I take care of it
general 2021-02-11 19:41:24 well if your dog smells like mildew then thats a problem
general 2021-02-11 19:41:52 a border collie and a pitbull-rottweiler mix
general 2021-02-11 19:42:01 I want a husky tho
general 2021-02-11 19:42:41 bro corgis are cool cause any breed they mix with is just a that breed version of a corgi
general 2021-02-11 19:43:21 cats dont love you
general 2021-02-11 19:43:23 dogs do
general 2021-02-11 19:43:31 yeah lol
general 2021-02-11 19:43:58 so taking care of them and giving them a home isn't good enough
well it's good enough for dogs
general 2021-02-11 19:44:06 this
general 2021-02-11 19:44:25 cats just stay cause you have food
general 2021-02-11 19:45:30 plus you got Ace the Bat Hound so another point for dogs
general 2021-02-11 19:46:00 he's batman's dog so he def has
general 2021-02-11 19:46:23 even monke likes dogs better
general 2021-02-11 19:46:59 also how

general 2021-02-11 19:47:33 huskies are hella smart
general 2021-02-11 19:48:06 my border collie has two different colored eyes
general 2021-02-11 19:48:37 yes
general 2021-02-11 19:48:51 scientific name for one of those
general 2021-02-11 19:49:05 LMAO
general 2021-02-11 19:49:26 they took a husky and just gave it stub legs
general 2021-02-11 19:49:58 bunnies are also better than cats so shut up
general 2021-02-11 19:50:58 yes but loyalty and love is more common in dogs than cats
general 2021-02-11 19:51:21 a dog will protect you
general 2021-02-11 19:51:26 a cat would just run away
general 2021-02-11 19:51:33 I can and I will
general 2021-02-11 19:52:26 that game is cringe

general 2021-02-12 19:23:37 3d items
general 2021-02-12 19:23:42 are only for ugc creators
general 2021-02-12 19:24:06 they are random artists that roblox allow to make 3d stuff
general 2021-02-12 19:24:13 go to avatar shop
general 2021-02-12 19:24:19 and then go to community creations
general 2021-02-12 19:24:33 those are all random people who got accepted

general 2021-02-12 19:26:33 I disagree
general 2021-02-12 19:26:50 old roblox is tied to good memories
general 2021-02-12 19:26:54 but worse graphics
general 2021-02-12 19:26:59 worse gameplay
general 2021-02-12 19:27:11 yes
general 2021-02-12 19:27:16 games were more simple
general 2021-02-12 19:27:39 now you have games that look better and have more going on and a more established community as a whole
general 2021-02-12 19:28:01 new roblox is an improvement but looking back at old roblox is still fun
general 2021-02-12 19:28:38 you can prefer old roblox but objectively new roblox is just better
general 2021-02-12 19:28:57 2006
general 2021-02-12 19:29:12 roblox released in 2006
general 2021-02-12 19:29:51 but yes if you look at new and old, new is just better lol
general 2021-02-12 19:30:10 better clothing, bigger communities, better graphics, more games,
general 2021-02-12 19:30:12 just better

general 2021-02-12 19:33:15 I never really liked minecraft videos
general 2021-02-12 19:33:30 the people making them didn't appeal to me
general 2021-02-12 19:33:44 I still liked those minecraft parodies tho
general 2021-02-12 19:34:52 fnaf fanbase was... something
general 2021-02-12 19:36:15 the game was to stressful for me
general 2021-02-12 19:36:36 it was just tap some things and get jumpscared like a lot until you beat it after a long time
general 2021-02-12 20:00:05 wrong lyrics
general 2021-02-12 20:00:25 I think its

general 2021-02-16 22:13:01 what are your greatest skills/talents?
general 2021-02-16 22:13:26 combat can work
general 2021-02-16 22:13:35 hire an actor
general 2021-02-16 22:13:41 and act like he's a mugger
general 2021-02-16 22:13:47 then just beat him up
general 2021-02-16 22:13:50 in front of them
general 2021-02-16 22:14:01 it will
general 2021-02-16 22:14:10 60% of the time it works 100% of the time
general 2021-02-16 22:14:28 cant press charges hes an actor
general 2021-02-16 22:14:42 NO
general 2021-02-16 22:14:48 no assault
general 2021-02-16 22:15:08 no
they are pretending to mug you
general 2021-02-16 22:15:20 not the other person
general 2021-02-16 22:15:34 no
general 2021-02-16 22:15:42 it can be
general 2021-02-16 22:15:49 if they are like 2 feet taller than you
general 2021-02-16 22:15:52 get a tall actor
general 2021-02-16 22:16:07 or get an actor who's like a shaolin monk
general 2021-02-16 22:16:28 beating up a shaolin monk
now thats impressive
general 2021-02-16 22:17:32 nah violence is pretty cool
general 2021-02-16 22:18:01 if I saw someone beat up a mugger I would think its pretty cool
general 2021-02-16 22:18:16 this is my point
general 2021-02-16 22:18:28 yes the opinion of one person
general 2021-02-16 22:18:33 solid argument
general 2021-02-16 22:18:42 and the opinion of taren no less
general 2021-02-16 22:18:45 taren doesnt count
general 2021-02-16 22:18:47 we all know that
general 2021-02-16 22:19:13 so you're telling me no one would think its cool to like beat up a mugger?
general 2021-02-16 22:19:23 I dont hit women so prolly
general 2021-02-16 22:19:40 well thats you tho, youre saying everyone
general 2021-02-16 22:20:10 so a dude roundhouse kicks a mugger, thats not cool?

general 2021-02-16 22:27:48 so what was this im confused

general 2021-02-17 00:54:56 jesus
general 2021-02-17 00:55:01 thats gonna hurt
general 2021-02-17 02:47:12 about 27
general 2021-02-17 02:47:30 usain can run at about 27 mph
general 2021-02-17 02:47:43 prolly more than that
general 2021-02-17 02:48:28 I actually don't know my 100m time
general 2021-02-17 02:49:26 I think mine is like 14 seconds
general 2021-02-17 02:49:29 for 100m
general 2021-02-17 02:50:14 did you call another team the "enemy" team?
general 2021-02-17 02:50:24 you don't do sports do you?
general 2021-02-17 02:50:43 thats weird
general 2021-02-17 02:50:46 dont do that
general 2021-02-17 02:50:52 it just
general 2021-02-17 02:50:53 isnt
general 2021-02-17 02:50:56 right
general 2021-02-17 02:51:07 ew
general 2021-02-17 02:51:11 okay taren
general 2021-02-17 02:51:27 dont say "ogey" ever
general 2021-02-17 02:51:39 holy shit it's a taren alt
general 2021-02-17 02:52:15 what kind of fight tho
general 2021-02-17 02:52:29 yeah what kind
general 2021-02-17 02:52:51 nah id prolly win
general 2021-02-17 02:53:03 I've taken down big guys before
general 2021-02-17 02:53:24 the key to a fight with a big guy is get them to the ground
general 2021-02-17 02:53:38 uhh, how fast is the car?
general 2021-02-17 02:53:50 it is
general 2021-02-17 02:53:54 get them to the ground
general 2021-02-17 02:54:03 then do a limb lock
general 2021-02-17 02:54:13 not if you are experienced
general 2021-02-17 02:54:16 and they arent
general 2021-02-17 02:54:54 if you get them in a good lock tho
general 2021-02-17 02:54:57 you can strike
general 2021-02-17 02:55:03 and prolly break their nose
general 2021-02-17 02:55:28 I need more practice with grappling tho
general 2021-02-17 02:55:41 not a lot of it in karate
general 2021-02-17 02:56:02 which is why you can beat them if you have good technique
general 2021-02-17 02:56:22 if you know what you are doing then a grapple is your best bet
general 2021-02-17 02:57:09 or if you arent good at grappling then you better be really good at dodging
general 2021-02-17 02:57:21 cause bigger guys tire easily
general 2021-02-17 02:57:42 yeah
general 2021-02-17 02:58:32 yeah snapping a knee is harder than you think
general 2021-02-17 02:59:04 best defense tho
pocket sand
general 2021-02-17 02:59:44 bad hygiene to use against you
general 2021-02-17 02:59:48 interesting
general 2021-02-17 03:00:05 long fingernails also helps keep the ladies away
general 2021-02-17 03:01:00 too easy to dodge
general 2021-02-17 03:01:23 you gotta pull out the bleach which leaves you vulnerable
general 2021-02-17 03:02:13 or you could just buy pepper spray
general 2021-02-17 03:02:33 which sprays better and with more force than tabasco in a spray bottle
general 2021-02-17 03:02:47 or get a taser
general 2021-02-17 03:02:56 taser is a good idea too
general 2021-02-17 03:03:15 getting a gun is hard in some states tho
general 2021-02-17 03:03:19 like mine
general 2021-02-17 03:03:48 my fists are more lethal than any silly gun
general 2021-02-17 03:04:35 I am the one master of Vildebeest-Do-Te
general 2021-02-17 03:05:28 I have trained my eyes to see things before they happen
general 2021-02-17 03:05:43 leading to me dodging any bullet
general 2021-02-17 03:06:01 idk if almost is good enough in this situation
general 2021-02-17 03:06:14 also pans arent very big
general 2021-02-17 03:06:23 a lot of your body wouldnt be covered
general 2021-02-17 03:06:38 yes, which is why my mod skills are so high
general 2021-02-17 03:06:47 yes
general 2021-02-17 03:07:04 already deleted them
general 2021-02-17 03:07:47 already did
general 2021-02-17 03:07:59 I did it so fast that its gonna take some time tho
general 2021-02-17 03:08:10 I went faster than the speed of light so like
general 2021-02-17 03:08:32 idk, like a year ago it didn't sound like I hit puberty
general 2021-02-17 03:08:34 and now
general 2021-02-17 03:08:37 deep
general 2021-02-17 03:09:13 I prefer the darkness
general 2021-02-17 03:09:30 I have trained my eyes to see in pitch black
general 2021-02-17 03:09:47 I also have learned echo location from the bats
general 2021-02-17 03:10:30 the bats taught me their ways
general 2021-02-17 03:10:42 I will soon achieve flight
general 2021-02-17 03:11:18 I have trained my eyes to see sound
general 2021-02-17 03:12:03 my eyes can also see all the way around the world if I focus
general 2021-02-17 03:12:15 so I can always see whats behind me
general 2021-02-17 03:12:39 lies
general 2021-02-17 03:12:58 well yeah
general 2021-02-17 03:13:00 cause its flat
general 2021-02-17 03:13:39 plus how does water even stay on earth, wouldnt it just fall off
general 2021-02-17 03:13:43 pour water on a ball
general 2021-02-17 03:13:50 see what happens
general 2021-02-17 03:14:16 they used quick travel
general 2021-02-17 03:14:36 well we live in the matrix
general 2021-02-17 03:14:40 so basically
general 2021-02-17 03:15:27 no, I have power over my body that no man possess, I can simply use my skills to get rid of any illness
general 2021-02-17 03:15:38 through meditation
general 2021-02-17 03:16:02 crafted by the people of the bat tribe in 1172

general 2021-02-19 22:43:05 idk merch in pc group in general doesnt get that many sales
general 2021-02-19 22:43:26 cause rickje advertised in discord, when he should really advertise in the roblox group
general 2021-02-19 22:43:40 like the group has almost 40k members
general 2021-02-19 22:43:42 with a lot of kids
general 2021-02-19 22:43:58 incorrect
general 2021-02-19 22:44:04 look at the messages there

general 2021-02-19 22:45:32 yes but all rickje would have to do it leave a shout, and we would still get some sales
general 2021-02-19 22:45:56 plus the old shirts are no bueno

general 2021-02-21 01:38:04 when the chain hits 100 sales I'll make a golden one
general 2021-02-21 01:38:53 I should make a biker jacket that says like "sus to the bone"
general 2021-02-21 01:39:07 its the first result if you just look up amogus
general 2021-02-21 01:39:23 no categories
general 2021-02-21 01:39:25 just amogus
general 2021-02-21 01:39:55 I would cry
general 2021-02-21 01:40:04 but a ton of people hopped on the trend
general 2021-02-21 01:40:17 look how many people started doing it after I did
general 2021-02-21 01:40:33 go for it

general 2021-02-21 01:45:15 would be a bobux generator
general 2021-02-21 01:45:22 amogus
general 2021-02-21 01:46:04 no its gonna be high quality drip
general 2021-02-21 01:47:38 drip is for everyone
general 2021-02-21 01:48:22 not gonna be basic, its gonna be swag and drip
general 2021-02-21 01:51:09 if you have what it takes

general 2021-02-21 02:37:33 dropping brand logos and jordans isnt the key to drip
general 2021-02-21 02:37:40 drip comes from inside
general 2021-02-21 02:37:56 swag isnt just the way something looks
general 2021-02-21 02:37:59 it tells a story

general 2021-02-26 01:38:37 yes
general 2021-02-26 01:38:43 I get ptsd every time I run
general 2021-02-26 01:38:50 of all the races I wanted to die
general 2021-02-26 01:39:19 dude that scares the shit out of me
general 2021-02-26 01:39:24 like right before you race
general 2021-02-26 01:39:29 its so scary
general 2021-02-26 01:39:53 especially when you look over and see the fucking ripped dudes who are 6'3"
general 2021-02-26 01:40:25 stretch
general 2021-02-26 01:41:07 stretching before running is just what you're supposed to do
general 2021-02-26 01:41:13 otherwise pain
general 2021-02-26 01:42:09 youre still worsening your performance
general 2021-02-26 01:42:48 its scientifically proven to increase performance and lower the risk of injury
general 2021-02-26 02:13:02 Im using a shit ton of motor lock on my current build and I know understand, why it is used so much
general 2021-02-26 02:28:54 lies, its 9:28 pm
general 2021-02-26 02:29:21 I lose sunlight at like 4:30 pm
general 2021-02-26 02:29:44 stupid winter
general 2021-02-26 02:32:11 bro motorlock is like magic wtf
general 2021-02-26 08:38:19 For filter bypass?
general 2021-02-26 08:38:39 Yeah that’s what filter bypass is
general 2021-02-26 08:39:02 A word was filtered and he said it in another way to avoid it being deleted by the bot
general 2021-02-26 08:39:08 Hence filter bypass
general 2021-02-26 14:48:36 <:fake:783659211128307712>
general 2021-02-26 14:49:39 <@!370594904268734464> you should know not to say the w-word in pcc, it riles everybody up
general 2021-02-26 14:50:56 yes make it look good
general 2021-02-26 14:51:56 idk what your pfp is from, but its prolly from deviant art
general 2021-02-26 14:52:41 deviant art is basically just a site where people post art, but theres weird stuff on it
general 2021-02-26 14:53:51 theres pretty cool art on there too, but I wouldnt post any there because there is a shit ton of people stealing work on deviant art, plus the weird shit
general 2021-02-26 14:54:50 its mostly just 14 year old girls who just learned how to use ibis paint
general 2021-02-26 14:55:19 it pretty much is, most of the pictures they find for the speed run is from there
general 2021-02-26 14:56:30 I dont think deviant art has embeds for discord
general 2021-02-26 14:56:53 oh then idk
general 2021-02-26 15:07:33 teletubby without head and arms is amogus
general 2021-02-26 15:10:08 that was me, but I wasnt telling you guys to look at anthropomorphic planes, thats on you
general 2021-02-26 15:10:33 you guys did the weird on your own dont blame me
general 2021-02-26 15:10:52 what should I expect at this point
general 2021-02-26 15:11:37 hold up
general 2021-02-26 15:12:16 but did any of us ask?
general 2021-02-26 15:12:29 I recall no one asking, but maybe thats just me
general 2021-02-26 15:12:47 where
general 2021-02-26 15:12:57 exactly
general 2021-02-26 15:13:01 no one asked
general 2021-02-26 15:13:07 sure thats why
general 2021-02-26 15:13:24 you sure or is it just is because it never happened
general 2021-02-26 15:13:58 sure you do
general 2021-02-26 15:14:43 to sum it up I made a joke that someone's pfp looks like it was from deviant art, and then they searched for like weird stuff on it for some reason
general 2021-02-26 15:15:26 district attorney?!?!

general 2021-02-26 18:25:17 like building a wider plane with propeller on top
general 2021-02-26 18:25:35 then you just arent using strategy to your advantage

general 2021-03-01 15:02:16 no, the item is 7 bobux nub
general 2021-03-01 15:02:40 I know roblox takes 30% so I raised it to a price that gave me 5 bobux

general 2021-03-01 15:47:36 no one needed or asked for a roblox vc, because they have discord, roblox vc is pointless
general 2021-03-01 15:48:07 roblox vc was for 13+ too
general 2021-03-01 15:48:27 still is
general 2021-03-01 15:49:59 even if they do, people will just lie about their age, they do the same thing on discord

general 2021-03-03 02:33:38 I have the strength of a larger child
general 2021-03-03 02:33:41 therefore
general 2021-03-03 02:33:43 I win
general 2021-03-03 02:33:57 moment

general 2021-03-03 18:53:24 I cant see someone say vector, and not bring up the despicable me character
general 2021-03-03 18:55:32 yousuf what is your pfp
general 2021-03-03 18:55:38 It looks like snake skin
general 2021-03-03 18:56:50 yeah but werent you in that group literally like 2 years ago
general 2021-03-03 18:57:13 so youre saying you were lame 2 years ago?
general 2021-03-03 18:57:20 what changed?
general 2021-03-03 18:57:34 your logic is flawed
general 2021-03-03 18:57:48 no the cycle ends
general 2021-03-03 18:57:51 you live
general 2021-03-03 18:57:53 then die
general 2021-03-03 18:58:11 and then whatever you believe religious wise happens
general 2021-03-03 18:58:36 people die also cause like, over population
general 2021-03-03 18:58:48 how would you know?
general 2021-03-03 18:58:57 have you ever died before?
general 2021-03-03 18:59:46 I mean im not wrong, if people didnt naturally die and more and more people were born, over population would happen
general 2021-03-03 19:00:12 elon musk is a fraud
general 2021-03-03 19:00:15 cry about it
general 2021-03-03 19:01:30 people act like he is the smartest being to exist
general 2021-03-03 19:01:45 like he's the second coming of god
general 2021-03-03 19:02:02 you are part of the problem
general 2021-03-03 19:03:27 people act like he single handedly does everything, when he has a team of people who do everything
general 2021-03-03 19:03:50 he isnt even the one who firgures out how to do the things he presents
general 2021-03-03 19:04:06 the only thing he is smart at doing
general 2021-03-03 19:04:08 is making money
general 2021-03-03 19:04:19 ill give credit for that
general 2021-03-03 19:04:48 people look at him as like a genius scientist or something, when he isnt, which is my point
general 2021-03-03 19:06:49 yes, but I feel like people dont look at him as just a rich guy, they look at him like he's tony stark or something
general 2021-03-03 19:07:33 he isnt even that smart, literally look at anything he has said about covid 19
general 2021-03-03 19:07:48 is it motor 2 related?
general 2021-03-03 19:08:41 "he" made
general 2021-03-03 19:09:14 yes, cause he's rich, not cause he's like tony stark and is a super genius
general 2021-03-03 19:10:38 stark industries is all about science that betters society, and all of the creations are pretty much made by tony stark
general 2021-03-03 19:11:03 was their original business yes
general 2021-03-03 19:11:07 but then he changed it
general 2021-03-03 19:13:52 that was my main problem with his character tho
general 2021-03-03 19:14:00 like he was sorta too smart
general 2021-03-03 19:14:17 its kinda lazy writing
general 2021-03-03 19:15:02 so was him figuring out time travel in like 2 minutes
general 2021-03-03 19:15:30 or just did some boop boops and bam, new element
general 2021-03-03 19:16:08 well the machine he had was for getting big and small
general 2021-03-03 19:16:27 but since when you go subatomic or whatever the time is different
general 2021-03-03 19:17:23 yeah but I think it wouldve been cooler if he did more then just sat in a chair and pressed a couple buttons, and then time travel
general 2021-03-03 19:18:37 Me, it gives me something to do
general 2021-03-03 19:18:51 I wonder if plane crazy will be in this one
general 2021-03-03 19:19:02 Like what, I’m not allowed to go outside
general 2021-03-03 19:19:22 I don’t need to
general 2021-03-03 19:19:58 I already am cracked at fortnite, what else do I need to know
general 2021-03-03 19:20:15 That’s the joke
general 2021-03-03 19:20:39 Idk programming sounds kinda hard
general 2021-03-03 19:20:58 Maybe
general 2021-03-03 19:21:20 Maybe I could program fortnite 2
general 2021-03-03 19:22:08 Idk about you but the best memes, are the ones that don’t fit a specific format
general 2021-03-03 19:22:20 The random memes
general 2021-03-03 19:22:22 Are best

general 2021-03-03 20:05:02 what?
general 2021-03-03 20:05:17 it doesnt matter
general 2021-03-03 20:05:24 he bypassed a word

general 2021-03-03 22:53:41 you can tell cause my name is vildebeest
general 2021-03-03 22:53:46 and by the way im vildebeest
general 2021-03-03 22:54:42 bro imagine all the people that were spending a lot of bitcoin back a couple years ago
general 2021-03-03 22:54:45 feelsbadman
general 2021-03-03 22:55:21 1 bitcoin is like almsot 40k usd, and there was a dude who spent 10k on a pizza
general 2021-03-03 22:55:47 a dude spent 10k bitcoin on a pizza before it was worth anything
general 2021-03-03 22:55:58 now 1 bitcoin is like around 40kusd
general 2021-03-03 22:56:19 so he essentially wasted millions of dollars on a pizza
general 2021-03-03 22:56:37 yeah but if he saved it
general 2021-03-03 22:56:41 he would be loaded
general 2021-03-03 22:56:53 for this exact situation
general 2021-03-03 22:57:34 I mean yeah but if you have 20 million, you wouldnt wanna waste 10 mil just cause you have another 10 mil
general 2021-03-03 22:58:09 yeah but like saving something that might go up in value is just smart
general 2021-03-03 22:58:26 I save all kinds of stuff for that reason
general 2021-03-03 22:58:57 Im aware
general 2021-03-03 22:59:12 I was just pointing out the humor in the situation
general 2021-03-03 22:59:52 no you guys just started making it a thing when it was just supposed to be a story
general 2021-03-03 23:09:19 are you our competition?
general 2021-03-03 23:09:42 dont say that so soon
general 2021-03-03 23:10:43 you have so many star wars memes and gifs
general 2021-03-03 23:10:50 just like how I have so many batman ones
general 2021-03-03 23:11:08 rbk truly is my equal/adversary
general 2021-03-03 23:11:19 the sub-zero to my scorpion
general 2021-03-03 23:11:47 he usually says weird thing about killing children and I stop paying attention
general 2021-03-03 23:12:23 and killing children, unless you missed that part from earlier<:trol1:776034519962222602>

general 2021-03-03 23:13:32 I have faith in humanity as a whole
general 2021-03-03 23:13:39 but some individuals no
general 2021-03-03 23:13:50 I see some people when I go outside
general 2021-03-03 23:13:52 and just
general 2021-03-03 23:14:28 no, I have faith in the human race in general, but I see people for what they are, I think most people are good, but I know for a fact some arent

general 2021-03-04 21:05:10 I used to draw, and my fingernail is not black
general 2021-03-04 21:06:06 Some types of bacteria, as well as fungal infection of the nail, can also produce melanin that discolours the nails. Nicotine stains from cigarettes, certain medicated lotions and dirt can also stain our nails. Injuries or ill-fitting shoes can cause bleeding under the nail, making it appear black.
this is about toenails but it prolly applies to fingernails too

general 2021-03-05 19:37:58 what are you trying to get into vip1?
general 2021-03-05 19:39:04 what?
general 2021-03-05 19:39:09 Im asking you lol
general 2021-03-05 19:41:53 left and right
general 2021-03-05 19:41:58 your rudders control it
general 2021-03-05 19:42:13 its pretty easy to add
general 2021-03-05 19:42:20 but my question is
general 2021-03-05 19:42:27 how tf is that 400 blocks
general 2021-03-05 19:42:37 yeah but how
general 2021-03-05 19:42:45 still wouldnt be close to 400
general 2021-03-05 19:43:48 pretty sure you cant do that
general 2021-03-05 19:44:11 you are inflating block count tho
general 2021-03-05 19:44:14 anyone could do that
general 2021-03-05 19:44:20 have a build thats super small
general 2021-03-05 19:44:27 add 300 motors for engines
general 2021-03-05 19:44:59 its still inflating the block count, the intent doesnt matter
general 2021-03-05 19:45:06 if someone used only single blocks
general 2021-03-05 19:45:16 without the intent to increase block count
general 2021-03-05 19:45:23 is it not still increasing block count?
general 2021-03-05 19:46:21 mini modding

general 2021-03-05 20:00:53 took me like 1 hour to do

general 2021-03-05 20:23:11 get a dedicated server
general 2021-03-05 20:23:14 for free
general 2021-03-05 20:23:29 look up space engineers dedicated server
general 2021-03-05 20:23:33 it will tell you more
general 2021-03-05 20:23:49 Dedicated servers in Space Engineers allow players to connect to a third party host, rather than using a player-host, in a peer-to-peer set-up. They are game instances intended for long time multiplayer games. They don’t depend on any player and they run without render and visual/audio effects. This will result to a faster connection and a more fluent multiplayer performance with less lag.

Dedicated servers are available for everyone who owns Space Engineers. You don’t need an extra Steam account, you get Space Engineers dedicated servers for free with your existing Space Engineers account.

Note: In order to run a dedicated server, server providers don’t require a licensed copy of the game. However, to obtain the game server files, at least one Steam account needs to have a valid license.

general 2021-03-08 20:33:28 cause that makes sense
general 2021-03-08 20:33:52 all grades are pretty much out of 100, anything less than 65 is fail
general 2021-03-08 20:34:59 nice

general 2021-03-08 20:36:27 everyone has
general 2021-03-08 20:37:17 my 8th grade social studies teacher would do project grades off of class vote, and whoever got most votes got 100, than second got 90, then that system all the way down to 50, it was bs
general 2021-03-08 20:37:45 so even if two people had equally good projects, only one could get a 100
general 2021-03-08 20:41:13 EXACTLY

general 2021-03-11 16:20:21 My name comes from a plane, tho the plane is named after an animal, It's a plane that I named it after, the vildebeest, is different than a wildebeest,
general 2021-03-11 16:22:00 Im aware the name originates from wildebeest, but I didnt name myself after a wildebeest, because they are two different things

general 2021-03-15 23:38:13 and then add the tracks
general 2021-03-15 23:38:16 and it will look good
general 2021-03-15 23:38:37 not the bottom
general 2021-03-15 23:38:46 puri has a skirt covering tracks too
general 2021-03-15 23:40:26 I was just using it as an example that using cylinders with tracks looks fine
general 2021-03-15 23:44:19 ive never seen such chat stupidity, until I started playing tower of hell last year
general 2021-03-15 23:44:43 because you dont have tracks
general 2021-03-15 23:44:54 your other version was whack too
general 2021-03-15 23:45:02 tracks look good
general 2021-03-15 23:45:06 whether you like it or not
general 2021-03-15 23:45:08 its true
general 2021-03-15 23:45:44 when people upvote something they dont do it because of how functional it looks
general 2021-03-15 23:45:51 they do it because of how good it looks
general 2021-03-15 23:48:11 signs

general 2021-03-16 15:09:02 not very surprising
general 2021-03-16 15:18:15 why, you can buy guns really easily
general 2021-03-16 15:18:47 self defense
general 2021-03-16 15:19:36 not very effective when the other person has a gun
general 2021-03-16 15:20:07 they are the ones attacking you, thats why I said self defense
general 2021-03-16 15:20:35 people can just obtain them illegally, if the dude is attacking or robbing you, I dont think the law concerns him that much
general 2021-03-16 15:21:28 wtf, no thats self defense
general 2021-03-16 15:21:36 yes
general 2021-03-16 15:22:07 okay a dude has a gun pointed at you, he is about to shoot you, you shoot him first, self defense
general 2021-03-16 15:22:35 I never said america was better
general 2021-03-16 15:22:43 since when
general 2021-03-16 15:23:19 NY Penal Law 35.15 states: …a person may use physical force upon another individual when, and to the extent that, he/she reasonably believes it to be necessary to defend himself/herself [or someone else] from what he/she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of [unlawful] physical force by such individual
general 2021-03-16 15:23:21 thats the law
general 2021-03-16 15:23:38 yeah im walnut brain
general 2021-03-16 15:23:54 well that law makes sense tho does it not?

general 2021-03-18 14:23:32 3
general 2021-03-18 14:23:48 yes im doing trigonometry and I want to die
general 2021-03-18 14:23:54 I thought it was gonna be easy
general 2021-03-18 14:24:01 because just triangles
general 2021-03-18 14:24:05 but nope
general 2021-03-18 14:24:22 yes but ive been doing this one equation for like an hour

general 2021-03-18 14:24:38 and im too dumb to not use one
general 2021-03-18 14:25:40 solve for θ: sinθ = cos(θ+25)
general 2021-03-18 14:25:45 thats the problem
general 2021-03-18 14:26:04 and it looks easy, but the calculators just bruh out on me
general 2021-03-18 14:26:27 pretty sure its degrees
general 2021-03-18 14:27:05 ight
general 2021-03-18 14:27:50 im good at finding the angles and side lengths for triangles part
general 2021-03-18 14:27:53 but this shit
general 2021-03-18 14:27:55 nope
general 2021-03-18 14:28:10 alright thank you very much

general 2021-03-18 16:07:04 especially when you are plummeting to the ground with your plane on fire
general 2021-03-18 16:07:22 like parachutes were a thing
general 2021-03-18 16:07:27 so why not use them
general 2021-03-18 16:07:42 like bailing out of those planes would be easy too
general 2021-03-18 16:07:47 cause no canopy

general 2021-03-22 18:18:00 rookie and I have the same question
general 2021-03-22 18:18:41 A person who is abrosexual may, at times, be pansexual, but at other times they may be heterosexual or asexual. Their sexual orientation is in flux. People who are pansexual are attracted to all people no matter their gender or sexuality.
general 2021-03-22 18:18:49 thats what comes up when you look it up

general 2021-03-30 00:05:52 if you wanna build something decent in babt you have to grind a lot or spend money
general 2021-03-30 00:05:59 in plane crazy you can just build
general 2021-03-30 00:06:22 use anti copy blacklist
general 2021-03-30 00:06:47 if you are so scared to get copied use the thing thats literally designed for it
general 2021-03-30 00:06:55 or just get a private server
general 2021-03-30 00:07:50 or get expert and get even more exclusive vip servers
general 2021-03-30 00:07:54 sup
general 2021-03-30 00:08:42 babt doesnt have swag physics
general 2021-03-30 00:09:17 yeah plus anything can fly if you have rockets
general 2021-03-30 00:09:30 and you gotta go through so much effort to make basic shapes in that game
general 2021-03-30 00:09:40 you gotta use size tool and angles and shit
general 2021-03-30 00:10:11 and you can even get those tools unless you grind for hours and hours or pay for it
general 2021-03-30 00:12:49 idk I find plane crazy more practical than babt and more simple

the-dump 2021-04-12 14:43:12 <@456226577798135808> not liking a racist meme doesnt mean you're a snowflake, but depending on it for humor, *does* make you not funny
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:44:53 okay so you made fun of a dude dying essentially
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:45:40 that doesnt make it okay lol
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:46:09 if your friends dad died, and you sent him a meme about it, the fact your intent was for it to be funny makes it okay?
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:46:56 I dont think making fun of a guy dying is too much to ask for
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:47:20 yes, key word some
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:48:25 being a comedian doesnt make you funny lol
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:48:33 literally anyone can make edgy jokes
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:48:52 edgy jokes are a lazy cop out for comedy a lot of the time
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:49:08 because even if it isnt funny, you get a reaction
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:49:47 yes, I think edgy jokes can be good
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:50:32 but I think theres a difference between making a clever edgy joke, and some random guy saying a racial slur, which is usually what they consider as an "edgy joke"
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:51:22 it wasnt tho lol
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:51:55 bruh
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:52:02 you dont know why its racist?
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:52:41 yes but I can pretty confidently say that joke was in fact racist
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:53:16 you're making a joke about a guy who was a target of racially motivated police brutality tho
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:53:45 no?
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:54:13 bruh what he was on the ground and the cop was choking him
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:54:27 mans literally said I cant breathe
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:55:00 yeah but when you got the guy on the ground, he isnt a threat, so why choke him
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:55:46 yes, but thats not how policing works lol
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:56:07 once you eliminate the threat, and got the guy detained, why would you choke him
the-dump 2021-04-12 14:56:59 so then what point are you trying to make?
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:00:04 you act like it was some sort of accident that the dude strangled him, what the cop did wasnt just some random stupid thing, he killed a dude when he didnt have to, racially motivated or not, making memes about it can be fairly seen as a fucked up thing to do
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:00:20 and the intention of most people when posting it know, its associated with racism
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:02:00 bruh this wasnt even up for argument
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:02:04 no
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:02:09 dont start a thing
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:04:19 I already stopped talking about it
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:05:03 stop
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:05:08 drop it
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:05:42 I think that joke is fine
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:05:49 people make obama memes all the time
the-dump 2021-04-12 15:06:20 the joke itself isnt like pushing a political agenda it just has a political person in the meme
general 2021-04-12 19:15:39 truth

bot-central 2021-04-16 00:44:33 !rank
general 2021-04-17 20:23:30 B-29 nose is finally done
general 2021-04-17 20:23:42 im gonna hide motor later
general 2021-04-17 20:24:29 rotations and motor lock
general 2021-04-17 20:25:15 idek how I would do that
general 2021-04-17 20:27:51 moment
general 2021-04-17 20:30:03 bruh why did you ping me
general 2021-04-17 20:30:30 no I just used the same method he did
general 2021-04-17 20:30:55 he hasnt even built a B-29 pretty sure lmao
general 2021-04-17 20:37:24 im gonna put so much effort in this B-29
general 2021-04-17 20:37:30 its gonna be my best build of all time
general 2021-04-17 20:38:34 like 2 or 3 days
general 2021-04-17 20:38:36 should this be the paint job I use?
general 2021-04-17 20:38:58 well it wasnt that hard once I figured out how to do it
general 2021-04-17 20:39:06 but figuring out how to do it took a while
general 2021-04-17 20:39:13 no
general 2021-04-17 20:39:21 the nose is gonna be the hardest part
general 2021-04-17 20:39:37 the tail is gonna be easy
general 2021-04-17 20:40:37 thats simple motorlocking
general 2021-04-17 20:41:01 angling isnt even hard
general 2021-04-17 20:42:22 the circular shape can be achieved through motorlock
general 2021-04-17 20:42:29 I meant without
general 2021-04-17 20:42:34 it doesnt need motorlock
general 2021-04-17 20:42:49 the body wont need motor lock either
general 2021-04-17 20:43:15 how is this an argument?
general 2021-04-17 20:43:31 bruh the circle shape can be achieved without motorlock
general 2021-04-17 20:43:51 literally half wedge down horizontal, then wedge, then half wedge down vertical
general 2021-04-17 20:44:01 no
general 2021-04-17 20:44:07 Ive known how to do it for a while
general 2021-04-17 20:44:14 look at my new one
general 2021-04-17 20:44:40 just cause I know how to motorlock doesnt mean I needed to use it
general 2021-04-17 20:44:52 my new build is motorlocked
general 2021-04-17 20:44:56 well not new
general 2021-04-17 20:44:59 like a month old
general 2021-04-17 20:45:46 
general 2021-04-17 20:45:57 the sides of the head are custom angles
general 2021-04-17 20:46:07 the tail is locked
general 2021-04-17 20:47:05 most of the motorlock is simple motorlocking
general 2021-04-17 20:47:10 its just the nose
general 2021-04-17 20:47:13 that needed all that stuff
general 2021-04-17 20:47:28 and this is the heli before being locked
general 2021-04-17 20:48:57 the tail is literally just one some angling then locking them
general 2021-04-17 20:49:10 the only other hard part is gonna be the vertical stabilizer
general 2021-04-17 20:49:18 cause idk how im gonna make it
general 2021-04-17 20:49:23 I cant just use wedges
general 2021-04-17 20:49:27 it will look bad if I do
general 2021-04-17 20:49:29 and blocky
general 2021-04-17 20:49:38 wings are gonna be ez
general 2021-04-17 20:49:58 the motor locking itself isnt that hard
general 2021-04-17 20:50:18 this isnt an argument we are talking about a build
general 2021-04-17 20:50:32 im not arguing wtf
general 2021-04-17 20:50:40 sup
general 2021-04-17 20:51:14 cause we have cool things like ?warn, ?mute, ?kick, and ?ban
general 2021-04-17 20:52:44 mans left the spaces inbetween
general 2021-04-17 20:52:48 edit it
general 2021-04-17 20:53:20 literally just backspace inbetween
general 2021-04-17 20:53:47 yes
general 2021-04-17 20:53:52 dont be toxic
general 2021-04-17 20:54:07 <:SquidWhat:783659214354382849>
general 2021-04-17 21:06:06 how do you have two designer roles
general 2021-04-17 21:06:28 not anymore
general 2021-04-17 21:06:33 your designer 4 gone
general 2021-04-17 21:06:50 cause youre only supposed to have the highest one
general 2021-04-17 21:07:04 because thats how the ranking system works
general 2021-04-17 21:07:13 you get better version of role you lose the old one
general 2021-04-17 21:07:21 cause mod prolly made mistake
general 2021-04-17 21:22:37 on the bright side it doesnt look like I have to angle the top of the tail down
general 2021-04-18 00:17:16 real
general 2021-04-18 00:20:48 NOT OKAY
general 2021-04-18 00:21:01 nah jk its decent
general 2021-04-18 01:06:09 now time for tail part
general 2021-04-18 01:06:26 yes it is going better than I thought
general 2021-04-18 01:06:32 I pushed the motors up
general 2021-04-18 01:06:43 prolly gonna cover them with a wall or something
general 2021-04-18 01:06:53 its going to be when I add the angled section
general 2021-04-18 01:07:03 Ive only built about half the body
general 2021-04-18 01:07:17 I just call the part that starts angling up the tail for some reason
general 2021-04-18 01:07:29 do you have rabies?
general 2021-04-18 01:07:37 uh oh
general 2021-04-18 01:07:54 skill
general 2021-04-18 01:08:02 also gman told me how to do the thing
general 2021-04-18 01:08:18 cause I couldnt find a way to do the nose without it
general 2021-04-18 01:08:22 zero regrets
general 2021-04-18 01:08:39 Ill prolly need help for the engines too ngl
general 2021-04-18 01:08:56 I already am
general 2021-04-18 01:09:42 B-29 is underrated tho, literally the best bomber of ww2 and most people talk about the B-17 smh
general 2021-04-18 01:10:09 this bad boy had the pressurized cabin and remote controlled turrets
general 2021-04-18 01:12:16 yeah but he doesnt have cool batman quotes when he does it
general 2021-04-18 01:13:03 oh shit
general 2021-04-18 01:13:11 im already 3rd wth
general 2021-04-18 01:13:19 ^
general 2021-04-18 01:13:49 yousuf doesnt have batman beyond pfp tho
general 2021-04-18 01:15:23 ight im on it
general 2021-04-18 01:15:43 can you link it?
the-dump 2021-04-18 01:17:18 tis indeed a crasher
the-dump 2021-04-18 01:17:38 had to learn the hard way
the-dump 2021-04-18 01:17:45 just to see if it was a fluke
general 2021-04-18 01:18:14 okay its gone
general 2021-04-18 01:18:16 swag
bot-central 2021-04-18 01:18:25 ?modstats
the-dump 2021-04-18 01:18:43 what how
the-dump 2021-04-18 01:18:49 I deleted it

the-dump 2021-04-18 01:19:03 either way its gone
general 2021-04-18 20:30:55 want me to warn you guys for toxicity too?
general 2021-04-18 20:31:55 calling a dude a dumbass and idiot repeatedly doesnt really solve an issue does it?
general 2021-04-18 20:32:17 minimodding
general 2021-04-18 20:32:47 I didnt realize breaking the rules was considered good moderating
general 2021-04-18 20:33:43 cause it gets in the way of mods doing it properly and almost always leads to people not liking the server
general 2021-04-18 20:33:57 or toxicity and stuff like that
general 2021-04-18 20:34:13 cause calling a dude unde, believe it or not, isnt really solving the issue properly
general 2021-04-18 20:34:56 bullying people until they leave the server isnt really that good of a job
general 2021-04-18 20:38:10 but who asked?
general 2021-04-18 20:42:51 <:swagfield:732550641876074526>
general 2021-04-18 20:43:06 sup

general 2021-04-18 20:45:26 yousuf has rodrick taught you nothing?!??!? Don't do work what you can get someone else to do
general 2021-04-18 20:46:09 you've never seen the diary of a wimpy kid movies?
general 2021-04-18 20:46:20 I now hate yousuf

general 2021-04-18 20:46:53 yes im aware I read them
general 2021-04-18 20:47:01 the quote is from the movies tho
general 2021-04-18 20:47:04 not the book
general 2021-04-18 20:47:10 which is why I said the movies
general 2021-04-18 20:47:55 but the movies are sick, except that new one they made
general 2021-04-18 20:48:00 god I hate that new one
general 2021-04-18 20:48:07 dont watch it
general 2021-04-18 20:48:09 DONT

bot-central 2021-04-18 21:33:23 !levels
general 2021-04-18 23:48:39 dang I like making bombers way more than making fighters
general 2021-04-18 23:49:02 easier to make it look more accurate
general 2021-04-18 23:50:24 you can make pretty much any fighter a bomber or attack plane by just adding some bombs and airbrakes ngl
general 2021-04-18 23:51:15 add some bombs to a P-51 and some airbrakes, bam an A-36
general 2021-04-18 23:53:16 thats what I did with my last build essentially
general 2021-04-18 23:53:35 cant say my heli is inaccurate when I made it up

general 2021-04-19 18:34:34 nvm
general 2021-04-19 18:35:38 I had a dream about doing bmx tricks on a trampoline
general 2021-04-19 18:36:19 for once my dream wasnt weird tho
general 2021-04-19 18:36:31 like I can actually see how all the things got in my brain
general 2021-04-19 18:44:26 lets keep it that way
general 2021-04-19 18:45:08 say literally one mildly interesting thing
general 2021-04-19 18:46:24 pfff im gonna watch justice league unlimited
general 2021-04-19 18:47:14 it was unlimited
general 2021-04-19 18:47:32 john stewart
general 2021-04-19 18:48:01 no
general 2021-04-19 18:48:08 its on HBO max
general 2021-04-19 18:48:24 I have netflix too
general 2021-04-19 18:49:06 hbo max is better, you get to see all the big movies coming out without going to the theaters
general 2021-04-19 18:49:52 also has a better good content to bad content ratio
general 2021-04-19 18:50:13 netflix has so much content, that a very small portion of it is actually worth watching
general 2021-04-19 18:50:29 and all the random bad content just makes it harder to find good content
general 2021-04-21 01:19:40 time to commit filtered word cause mod
general 2021-04-21 01:39:15 get image perms

general 2021-04-22 22:34:01 reviews have been good so far
general 2021-04-22 22:34:11 only downside is that it doesnt have johnny cage

creations-chat 2021-04-26 12:50:59 pretty easy to not get banned
general 2021-04-26 13:10:33 dog you act like you didnt just break the rules
general 2021-04-26 13:11:13 bro using a racial slur is against the rules, the context doesnt matter
general 2021-04-26 13:11:56 yeah but why
general 2021-04-26 13:12:00 we have better planes
general 2021-04-26 13:12:57 theres more things to something than payload
general 2021-04-26 13:13:24 its a plane we dont really need
general 2021-04-26 13:13:34 we have other newer planes to fill its roles
general 2021-04-26 13:13:58 no, but it doesnt take one to know that we dont need something lol
general 2021-04-26 13:14:12 also what is an air force manager exactly?
general 2021-04-26 13:15:06 why would they do?
general 2021-04-26 13:15:12 when we have an A-10
general 2021-04-26 13:15:29 yes F-35 is multirole
general 2021-04-26 13:15:34 but we still have A-10s
general 2021-04-26 13:16:01 it really wouldnt
general 2021-04-26 13:16:32 bro the A-10 has like the strongest gun of all time
general 2021-04-26 13:16:42 its built way strogner too
general 2021-04-26 13:16:57 exactly lol
general 2021-04-26 13:17:21 ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO
general 2021-04-26 13:17:26 ITS FOR GROUND TARGETS
general 2021-04-26 13:17:56 an F-111 would get destroyed in a dogfight
general 2021-04-26 13:18:26 literally any modern jet could destroy the f-111 it is not good for dogfighting
general 2021-04-26 13:18:47 no the plane def does matter
general 2021-04-26 13:19:09 you could put the best pilot ever in a P-40 and its gonna lose to the F-22
general 2021-04-26 13:19:52 and?
general 2021-04-26 13:20:28 are you actually saying a prop would beat a jet?
general 2021-04-26 13:21:03 dog the A-10 isnt even a fighter
general 2021-04-26 13:21:39 yeah it was the first jet ever, so obviously it wouldnt be that good, but Im talking a prop to a modern day jet fighter
general 2021-04-26 13:22:35 okay second point still stands
general 2021-04-26 13:23:00 your statement is kind of correct but you are ignoring the other parts
general 2021-04-26 13:23:35 okay? would never be able to shoot the jet down cause its too slow whats your point?
general 2021-04-26 13:24:09 bruh a ww1 plane could not dodge fucking jet missiles or bullets
general 2021-04-26 13:24:27 NO
general 2021-04-26 13:24:28 YOU CANT
general 2021-04-26 13:24:31 YOU LITERALLY CANT
general 2021-04-26 13:25:21 one missile and the ww1 plane is done bruh
general 2021-04-26 13:25:27 they are super fucking slow
general 2021-04-26 13:25:49 jets arent dependent on guns
general 2021-04-26 13:26:25 jets use missiles way more they only have like 2 seconds worth of gun ammo
general 2021-04-26 13:26:39 bruh what

general 2021-06-05 01:33:19 no
general 2021-06-05 01:33:22 no it is not
general 2021-06-05 01:33:32 as a stunt person
general 2021-06-05 01:34:19 before he went off and made "Drunken Master" and "Snake In The Eagle's Shadow" in 1978
general 2021-06-05 01:34:27 my pfp is from drunken master
general 2021-06-05 01:34:54 drunken boxing
general 2021-06-05 01:35:24 hes a cop in that one too

general 2021-06-05 01:35:35 he fights pirates in that one
general 2021-06-05 01:35:53 and does that cool stunt where he falls through those overhangs
general 2021-06-05 01:36:13 his best movie was Police Story tho
general 2021-06-05 01:36:25 police story
general 2021-06-05 01:36:58 where he slides down that pole through that roof and fucked up his spine
general 2021-06-05 01:37:07 just do subs its what I do
general 2021-06-05 01:37:19 they sound weird and dont match when you do dubbed
general 2021-06-05 01:37:49 his best stuff was made in china tho he gets recognized for the american ones but he has way less stunt control in those ones
general 2021-06-05 01:38:19 there is
general 2021-06-05 01:38:28 oh thats what you meant
general 2021-06-05 01:38:43 I thought you meant in general cause he gets framed in police story too
general 2021-06-05 01:39:35 have you seen "Who Am I?" he does a stunt where he slides down a building and its sick as fuck
general 2021-06-05 01:40:35 I can respect tom cruise movies too but its hard to like him cause of the scientology thing
general 2021-06-05 01:41:51 wait we still talking jackie chan?

general 2021-06-05 01:45:45 eh
general 2021-06-05 01:45:51 didnt care for that one too much
general 2021-06-05 01:46:01 too many special effects
general 2021-06-05 01:46:11 kinda takes away from the appeal to jackie chan

general 2021-06-05 01:48:51 now its just loud noises and bright colors
general 2021-06-05 01:49:05 like they dont have any plots or morals that are interesting

general 2021-06-05 01:49:41 and they actually dealt with dark topics
general 2021-06-05 01:50:12 yeah the og titans was sick the new one is just a joke
general 2021-06-05 01:50:48 made all the characters look weird and then took away all the stuff that was cool about them

bot-central 2021-06-09 01:08:25 !rank
general 2021-06-09 22:50:21 VPNs traffics your data through an encrypted tunnel and hides your IP
general 2021-06-09 22:50:30 so you can still get targeted ads lmao
general 2021-06-09 22:51:01 yes it stands for swag
general 2021-06-09 22:52:19 I didnt say VPNs meant you couldnt be tracked
general 2021-06-09 22:52:31 there are literally countless ways to track someone online
general 2021-06-09 22:52:44 okay poor choice of words whatever
general 2021-06-09 22:53:24 VPNs are really only good for better internet sorta and getting around country blocks
general 2021-06-09 22:53:40 yes
general 2021-06-09 22:53:49 helps with internet congestion

general 2021-06-09 22:59:08 youtube ads are always bad
general 2021-06-09 22:59:35 and are always highly suggestive even though youtube has strong censorship
general 2021-06-09 22:59:38 makes no sense
general 2021-06-09 23:00:56 youtube ads are random or apply to the masses of channels and stuff, so like if you are watching a video about martial arts, a self defense ad might come up
general 2021-06-09 23:00:59 happens to me
general 2021-06-09 23:01:26 but for the most part they are just anime ads about mobile games
