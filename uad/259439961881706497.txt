plane-crazy 2020-10-01 04:35:29 itd be nice to have gentle and smoothened railways in a new map
bot-central 2020-10-01 04:37:01 ?remindme 5 years p

general 2021-08-26 10:04:13 ik
general 2021-08-26 10:04:14 idk
general 2021-08-26 10:05:22 what
general 2021-08-26 10:05:25 graf zeppelin
general 2021-08-26 10:05:26 are ships in game
general 2021-08-26 10:05:28 what
general 2021-08-26 10:05:44 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:04:52 I have mixed feelings about the cutter remodel
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:05:36 Because I use them a lot in builds because of their unique shape for creating edges that are impossible with regular blocks and wedges
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:06:02 So a remodel would mess up those builds, but I also support it because it's going to balance out shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:06:47 I use cutters frequently on wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:06:51 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:07:06 Maybe releasing a wedge that is similar to the old cutter model
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:07:27 They'll still be messed up in new versions of the game but at least you can replace them
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:07:42 Hell i even use cutters on ships
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:08:07 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:08:57 But yeah if they're remodeling blocks they should make sure it doesn't mess up old builds by releasing the old model as a separate block etc
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:09:29 Omg I hope motors don't look too weird if they're being remodeled
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:09:35 Yeah ^
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:09:58 Because again I know a few places you can use motors decoratively
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:10:42 But then who knows they could be remodeled aswell
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:11:15 I think what plane crazy really needs now is just a code rewrite and possibly a new map
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:11:31 I am completely happy with staying with the old blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:12:00 Exacfly
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:12:46 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:13:41 Maybe keeping the legacy blocks (functional or nonfunctional) alongside the new models?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:14:10 I agree. Plane crazy has its limits.
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:16:16 Mmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:16:39 But regardless I still hope they keep the legacy blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:16:58 As they have many, many purposes that are different from their intended use (cutters)
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:17:41 And the fact that the new cutter is taller could cause a lot more issues too
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:25:20 The explosion
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:25:24 ?
