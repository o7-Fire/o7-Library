The Tale of gt.500 (707457381508055090)
general 2020-06-13 22:20:30 some guy asked to copy my plane and i said "no"
general 2020-06-13 22:20:41 he gets mad and asks everyone to let him copy their stuff
general 2020-06-13 22:20:53 "I want to be cool like everyone else"
general 2020-06-13 22:23:28 i dont think you can
general 2020-06-22 02:53:21 is it just me or are control surfaces a bit glitched
general 2020-07-06 22:24:55 there's some guy saying that he'll copy my build, is there some exploit that does that?
general 2020-07-06 22:25:05 i dont want it to be taken
general 2020-07-06 22:25:23 i did that
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:55:57 but why
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:58:26 i dont really like posting my creations here because people just dislike everything
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:01:54 looks nice
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:03:20 this is my f-4 phantom from a while ago
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:03:32 it handled really well but then i made a j-20
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:03:41 and it mmediately became obsolete
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:04:18 i tried to get the wings to kinda fold but it looked chunky and ugly
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:04:33 so i just left it like that
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:05:28 and this is my j-20 before i made a better (and more accurate!) paint job
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:05:32 i think your copter looks nice
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:06:19 i like that custom gear
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:06:46 coaxial rotors are pretty ugly ngl
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:06:54 i tried making different types for my copter
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:07:10 it kinda leans to the side but oh well
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:08:11 uh oh
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:08:30 so what do you think about the j-20 that i posted above
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:08:34 anything i should improve
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:09:27 
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:09:34 please tell me what i can improve
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:11:01 mk
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:11:12 hmmmm let me try to get it
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:11:34 sorry but i dont have it
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:11:39 let me get a screenshot in game
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:13:25 alr here it is
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:18:05 i think i just need to put the wings a bit forward actually
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:18:15 a bit closer to the canards
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:19:05 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:19:27 i like it because it does cleaner barrel rolls and flies (somewhat) inverted
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:19:46 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:24:33 still doesn't mean they hate the british really
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:24:41 that's what you think
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:24:46 not other people
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:25:04 what if it was an effortless jet?
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:25:28 if people downvote because of the jet, that doesn't mean that they hate the british
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:27:14 it looks alright
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:28:16 if you had a darker red it would have looked a bit better
creations-chat 2020-07-12 21:28:34 but the rest of it looks fine
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:39:35 you kinda need to tilt the rudders
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:39:54 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:40:35 i think it's just that you need to make the top look a bit smoother
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:40:57 like maybe use 1x2 wedges of 1x2 half wedges
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:41:50 the intakes look a bit small,
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:42:13 i can show you a design that looks a bit better
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:42:20 just give me a few
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:45:32 i try to stay away from harriers because im not good at VTOL
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:45:57 here is my new design for the f-35 intake
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:45:59 it ain't perfect but oh well
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:46:25 i think you should replace the half wedges on top to fit the wing
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:46:36 but yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-19 18:47:57 i need to practice that
creations-chat 2020-07-21 20:23:41 its easy to take screenshots
creations-chat 2020-07-21 20:25:24 thats not a reason
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:23:15 damn it i wish i had saved the pics for my j-20
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:24:34 any thoughts on this?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:24:53 usaf thunderbirds paint
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:25:17 sadly i couldn't get the ends of the wings to fold but oh well
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:26:42 what about this
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:27:39 i think i kinda messed up on the wings but oh well
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:27:51 why
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:28:06 or is it the intake
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:28:11 is that what

creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:28:24 i wanna see
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:30:10 probably my worst fighter jet
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:30:17 i hate most of it
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:30:35 seriously thinking about deleting it and starting all over
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:31:02 engines are shitty, horizontal stabilizes are garbage, wings are meh
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:31:41 uggggghhh i wanna delete it
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:32:08 its my best handling jet besides the J-20
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:32:13 but yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:32:16 delete times
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:32:40 no

creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:32:56 what plane should i make
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:33:45 ohhh yes
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:33:49 thats a good idea
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:33:54 alrighty
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:35:20 im tired of seeing so many siren heads
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:35:34 they just run into your creation and it's very bothersome
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:36:30 whats a good material to make a silver paint effect
general 2020-07-22 20:38:40 woah a v-22 osprey is flying over my house rn
creations-chat 2020-07-22 20:39:07 ok
general 2020-07-22 20:39:29 hmm
general 2020-07-22 20:39:38 i see lots of airliners too bc i live near an airport
general 2020-07-22 20:40:38 another osprey
general 2020-07-22 20:40:40 what
general 2020-07-22 20:41:12 olfactory hallucinations?
general 2020-07-22 20:41:29 search it up
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:23:33 hmmm
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:23:54 it needs improvement
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:24:21 the nose looks a bit odd
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:24:35 and it has a ton of gear
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:24:42 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:26:14 i think it looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:26:33 although maybe you can use pontoons on the wings for it to look a little smoother
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:27:22 and maybe try to tilt the wings down a little bit like the real thing
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:28:07 but besides that it's a solid build
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:28:46 those things on the end of the wings
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:28:51 don't know what they're called
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:29:41 use pontoons
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:29:45 doesn't fall off
creations-chat 2020-07-23 03:31:25 i think middle pontoon and then front pontoon on the...front
help 2020-07-23 22:58:43 the most low effort pvp build
help 2020-07-23 22:59:00 and those types of people usually camp in front of your spawn too
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 18:37:48 its been so long since i've seen a pvp server with no shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:29:26 my b-52 so far, any thoughts?
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:30:59 i think i might need to make the landing gear with pistons
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:31:12 just to make the wheels look a bit accurate
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:38:11 isn't the most accurate landing gear, but that's what i could fit into the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:38:27 i'll cover it up soon
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:40:51 nice
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:50:05 i got all the landing gear now, as well as the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-07-24 21:50:30 that huge gap is where the wings will be build
creations-chat 2020-07-24 22:02:39 progress on the wings
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:16:50 maybe because he had so many downvotes on his sub?
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:17:41 im not justifying it lol
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:17:51 im just giving a reason as to why
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:29:18 stop being so mad jeez
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:29:32 dont post WIPs in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:29:38 or else many downvotes
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:30:07 just because other people post WIPs all the time doesn't mean you get to
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:32:18 me too
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:32:27 my b-52 is absolute garbage
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:36:03 .........
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:36:56 i very much doubt that
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:38:17 should i keep the windows as black or should i use default color
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:39:23 then you did a good job <@!461644261566185503>
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:41:07 your build is pretty successful
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:41:15 yet you have 6 downvotes and no upvotes
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:42:59 sometimes im a bit disappointed when i get downvotes but afterwards idgaf
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:43:37 want to see my b-52?
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:45:33 i had to use the default jet engines because customs couldn't fit
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:45:40 i have a feeling that it's too long
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:46:07 i had to do some folding as well with the wings and rear
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:46:14 oh my god
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:46:29 but im really happy with the nose
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:46:55 oooh i'd like to land on that
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:46:57 
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:47:08 shitty engines but i'll fix that
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:47:54 it is the worst plane ever
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:48:04 tried to get the details in but uhhhh
creations-chat 2020-07-24 23:49:28 it's really hard to land because the gear collapses because pistons
creations-chat 2020-07-25 02:43:54 does anybody know how to stop the pistons from collapsing?
help 2020-07-25 02:48:51 does anybody have any tips on how to stop the pistons from collapsing in on themselves?
help 2020-07-25 02:49:11 it's really hard to use them as proper landing gear
help 2020-07-25 02:49:57 ok
help 2020-07-25 02:49:59 thank you
creations-chat 2020-07-25 05:21:04 just because people downvote doesn't mean you have to do that
creations-chat 2020-07-25 05:21:06 but ok
creations-chat 2020-07-26 03:57:22 it looks a bit fat
creations-chat 2020-07-26 03:57:39 and maybe make the wings larger or longer
creations-chat 2020-07-26 04:01:45 you dont need to fold
creations-chat 2020-07-26 04:02:05 just make it a little thinner and make the wings a bit larger and it'll be perfect
help 2020-07-27 03:07:04 does anybody know why my jets perform poorly when i fold the wings?
help 2020-07-27 03:07:12 and any way i can fix it?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:50:55 i hate it so much when people try to flex their tutorial planes
creations-chat 2020-07-28 00:21:00 before i had a really large and disproportionate intake, does this look good?
creations-chat 2020-07-28 00:29:23 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-28 00:29:33 ill try to make it smaller
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:35:03 bruh somebody is copying my drone design
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:35:21 i tried to confront them but they blacklisted me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:35:35 already did
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:35:52 it just pisses me off
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:35:58 like it's such an easy desgin
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:36:00 *design
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:36:17 im not a police officer anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:36:24 just got lazy and didnt change my pfp
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:37:39 i'd rather leave oders alone
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 20:37:45 they dont need the attention
creations-chat 2020-07-29 01:58:02 how do you do such clean turns like that?

creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:04:17 alrighty
creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:05:15 alrighty
creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:05:42 i used keybinds on my control surfaces but this might be better
creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:06:11 i have a thunderbirds f-4 phantom and it might work well with this
creations-chat 2020-07-29 18:24:45 i tried to make the rotors as big as i can but they don't fit in my plot. does this look good?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 18:28:11 does anybody have any tips of how to make the rotors fully tilt forward without my osprey plummeting down to earth?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 18:31:41 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-29 18:31:46 thank you
creations-chat 2020-07-29 23:55:21 anything i should add to this osprey?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 23:56:03 <@!455801932875825162> go to <#533294912586645521>
creations-chat 2020-07-30 05:32:53 well it depends on what you're building
creations-chat 2020-07-30 05:33:18 if you're building something from real life i think it has to be accurate
creations-chat 2020-07-30 05:34:03 what
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:09:18 i know
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:09:26 its painful to watch
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:35:55 hmmm
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:36:06 maybe propellor engines?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:47:36 "the back thing"
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:47:52 turn it into a chinook
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:48:22 remove the tail rotor, maybe add jet engines on the back, cover it up, some details, and bam a chinook
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:50:40 no
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:50:44 just for the looks
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:58:19 make this
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:58:47 i did the rotors terribly, i know there should be 3 blades
creations-chat 2020-07-30 23:59:00 but i dont know how to make it like that so this will do
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:00:25 no
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:00:36 not-so-accurate v-22 osprey
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:02:15 v-22 osprey
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:06:06 i think thats what it is
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:06:18 if you made the cockpit a little higher it would look better
creations-chat 2020-07-31 00:09:10 hmm
creations-chat 2020-07-31 03:05:38 make it look more like a jet
creations-chat 2020-07-31 03:06:14 it looks kind of like a rectangle with rockets and some weird nose
creations-chat 2020-07-31 03:06:24 use more wedges to get a better look
creations-chat 2020-07-31 03:11:36 i really dont like it when you blacklist someone but they can still sit inside of your build
creations-chat 2020-07-31 03:19:46 the color looks nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:39:51 some guy in this server is having a mental breakdown over "safety panels"
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:40:32 idk what that is
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:40:38 but hes just freaking out
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:41:43 "you need to add safety panels or else it wont fly duh"
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:41:49 all he talks about is safety panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:42:46 thats what i thought but he makes no sense
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:43:18 probably
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:43:40 he's like "you need to build a plane, this game is all about planes"
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:43:58 he hasn't read the description it appears
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:45:53 safety panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:47:03 no it's obviously safety panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:47:10 everybody knows about that
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:47:50 k
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:48:47 he wont answer
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:49:00 hes just trying to jump on my osprey and glitching it out in the process
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:49:12 im just waiting for him to start raging about me blacklisting him
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 20:50:35 hes just shitting on people's creations when his is a rectangle with landing gear
creations-chat 2020-08-01 04:28:12 my god that will be a huge build
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 16:58:53 why is it a thing that blacklisted people can still sit inside your creation
creations-chat 2020-08-02 02:00:05 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-02 02:05:21 no
creations-chat 2020-08-02 02:08:03 im trying to make a nimrod, here is some of the fuselage. pls share thoughts

creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:54:49 second is gj's
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:55:05 looks like a blatant copy to me
