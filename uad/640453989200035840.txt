plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:30:24 Worst things in this game are shredder bugs, Tutorial planes, and box weapons
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:30:41 Someone built am evangalion
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 19:31:20 God I hate people who build boxes as their weapons
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 19:32:21 Like we get it your so good at the game that you build boxes that have 17 gun on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 19:32:56 This game needs a town and buildings
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 19:33:06 I want to bomb them like allied bomber in 1944
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 19:34:13 Its a combat dozer

plane-crazy 2020-08-27 19:08:18 His name is reclusions HD

general 2020-08-27 21:30:16 We need a flat black
general 2020-08-27 21:30:26 Trap doors are hard to connect

general 2020-08-27 21:30:55 Ok
general 2020-08-27 21:31:09 Pol
general 2020-08-27 21:31:12 Lol
general 2020-08-27 21:36:01 OK so disconnectors work good
general 2020-08-27 21:36:33 I think 70% of this community is war thunder players right?
general 2020-08-27 21:37:34 Lame?
general 2020-08-27 21:37:47 More like 7years with of grind to finish one tree
general 2020-08-27 21:41:00 This game should have stuka sirens
general 2020-08-27 21:41:36 The game is so quiet when no one has speakers
general 2020-08-27 21:53:44 Does anyone know how to do the shark teeth paint job?

plane-crazy 2020-08-30 18:55:18 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 18:55:40 People should make P47s more often
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 18:55:49 I've never seen one ingame
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 18:56:03 Even though you could put basicly anything on it
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:09:58 
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:10:41 I hope to god shredders get removed
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:11:34 If anything maybe remove cutters? Not many people use them for anything BT shredders
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:11:56 I have a solution
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:11:58 First off
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:12:04 Be faster
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:12:12 Shredders are nothing if they can't catch uo
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:12:14 Second

plane-crazy 2020-09-08 18:29:07 I have a gltich where I cant enter other people's bases
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 18:29:48 There's no barrier
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 18:37:29 How do I do the motor think that combines objects into one space?
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:23:06 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:24:14 Wish there was a report chanel
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:24:23 But I guess this will keep happening
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:24:37 2 last building German ww2 symbol

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:24:53 And one main account defending them
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:07 It even spinsðŸ˜”
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:30 Their German ww2 symbol spins
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:26:14 We really need more people on this

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:23:27 Mans using a shredder and lag bombing and nothing will be done about it
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:24:46 Someone needs to design an anti shredder weapon
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 16:56:14 Ahat are the motor thungies that combine objects into one space
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:15:26 Recently tried motor controls
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:15:40 They are pretty good for maneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:15:46 But slow my plane down to much
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:16:00 I think I'm going to stick with control surface's
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:16:36 This game should have thiccer wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:16:54 Dunno how to

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:26:05 All we have is small and tiny
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:26:22 Shy not just rename small to landing gear and tiny to small landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:26:50 One thing I do hope for is a bigger map
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:27:17 Epic
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:27:21 Also
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:27:29 They should add actual bombs
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:27:36 Instead of TNT
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:27:50 Like replace round TNT with bombs
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 20:41:13 Is there any corner versions of the half wedge from the normal wedge tab?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 18:21:51

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:10:46 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:11:53 Wish TNT didn't have the white line and words on it
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:14:47 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:15:46 Should I give my bomber a turret or front facing guns?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:15:56 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:16:01 Its a smaller bomber doe

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:19:14 A gun who puts all the guns and missiles he can fit om his car and camps out at peoples bases
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:19:59 I build all my vehicles for PVP
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:20:23 PvP is way harder than it should be
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:20:40 It takes like 4099 shots to destroy 1 wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:20:46 And the plane still just flies away
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:21:31 Planes with over 300 parts are impossible to kill
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:21:51 Your best option against bombers is legit dropping a bomb on them
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:22:58 My friend tree has some of the most effective planes I've ever seen and it took him 10 mins to destroy 1 Catalina
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:23:39 And even then it flew away tih no tail and missing half of his left wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:24:11 I have no clue
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:24:22 Though it was kinds cool looking
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:24:27 I hardly see Catalina's
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:25:30 BTW how many bombs you think I could fit on this while also being decently maneuverable
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:26:26 Wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:28:17 Why is there so many people using the P40 and B17 tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:28:59 Hmmk
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:30:05 PvP?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:30:53 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:31:01 I was in a server like that a few mins ago
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:31:08 White van?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:31:36 > popular aircraft i guess
I can see the B17 but why the P40? It hardly as iconic compared to like the P51
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:32:18 B17
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 21:33:45 Yeah lol
