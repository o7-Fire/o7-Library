The Tale of Large_TLW (822458590685298699)
general 2023-06-09 15:18:11 Oh no

I've spoken about what I'm about to before here but now it is Bad.


I had an old plane that was just spazzing allowed the place.
Like I didn't Touch anything and nothing was moving and it still twitched all over the place.
I just assumed my aircraft must be broken then,
But it returned!

 Now I had just finished a tut of vulpen, but now that thing is just twitching all over the place.
There is nothing buildt wrong as I looked very close at the instructions, but it just freaks out.

And the Worst part:

I can't fix it.
I've tried:
Lower speeds
M2m
Temepering with the landing gear
Anchors

But still it just doesn't work!
I'm convinced that some saves are just haunted!
I need help...
