general 2020-08-04 10:35:17 Reduce graphics
general 2020-08-04 10:35:51 Get 7G network
general 2020-08-04 10:37:16 I use hover propulsion and big air brakes
general 2020-08-04 10:39:02 I should create a hypersonic jet with air brakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 10:41:01 I once lost half a day of progress in one game because my mom turned off the router
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 10:42:03 I save often
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 10:42:29 One back up file
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:19:52 Hello everyone
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:20:39 I made a water speed rocket yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:21:41 Well not literal rocket but a jet ski with propellors
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:22:11 It's insane
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:24:08 And if it was possible to drive irl you most likely would die a horrible split second death
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:20:26 That's what I picture when I think about America
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:22:08 It scares me
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:23:01 
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:23:21 Eagle
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:24:00 Yeah can't you see those sharp claws?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:25:25 They seem to like bread
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:21:38 Now I want to make a propellor engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:23:27 My last project was a double sided spinning shield around a turret
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:23:59 Btw it works well against shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:57:22 I usually put a hover engine and a ball wheel under it
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:58:18 Only down side is that you can't put anything next to the hover engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 19:59:36 Atleast it works in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:05:41 Depends what defies as winning
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:06:18 Hmm
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:06:23 Neither
help 2021-06-19 17:30:41 is there any track design that doesnt slip?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:30:15 has anyone ever made a engine before?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:30:44 im just curious
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:32:10 id love to see some actual engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:33:54 can anyone show me a working engine? id appreciate it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:34:28 please
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 19:35:29 sigh...
help 2021-06-19 19:36:37 can anyone show me a working engine? and please dont answer like a typical 10yr old
help 2021-06-19 19:43:53 im talking about piston engines
help 2021-06-19 19:45:18 better than what i could make
help 2021-06-19 20:53:26 <@!660725956935286789> thanks. true but it works
help 2021-06-19 20:54:34 im trying to make a engine with a working timing system
help 2021-06-19 20:55:55 so far i have made a balanced piston system with a single motor power source
help 2021-06-19 20:57:05 just trying to figure out how i can make a reliable power transfer system
help 2021-06-19 20:59:47 i tried a belt but it slips
help 2021-06-20 01:26:20 whats a "expert" supposed to be?
help 2021-06-20 01:34:27 seems pointless
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:24:40 After a handful of encounters I made a turret that can easily defend against the regular flying shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:25:54 Imagine building a tutorial shredder bug just to flex on others
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:26:47 Not really
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:17 You can also out distance them
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:29:03 I could probably come up with dozens of ways to beat them but I just want to focus on building better model engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:14 If there is anything I hate more than shredder bugs it's people who have smoke pipes all over the place at once
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:37:37 Why are you expecting someone dumb to be smart
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 22:42:01 Wings... Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 22:46:15 To be honest it doesn't realistically make much sense
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 23:37:46 im fairly surtant that my engine is unique to me
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 23:38:44 still making it better
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:43:34 no because i dont have a plane
creations-chat 2021-06-21 00:51:06 thats a bike?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:58:11 Did someone say shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 05:02:56 <:patchywhat:612704277747466253>
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 05:04:42 Stop spamming....
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 05:08:22 Imagine a ontopic conversation
help 2021-06-21 07:13:15 is there any way to lock motor2 in its angle after activating it and so that it doesnt slip under high torque?
help 2021-06-21 07:14:09 id really need that knowledge right now
help 2021-06-21 07:19:02 totally not because im building a engine or anything
help 2021-06-21 07:24:22 <@!707953054489509978>but i cant set it so a specific angle
help 2021-06-21 07:26:23 how
help 2021-06-21 07:28:20 then it wont spin
help 2021-06-21 07:32:13 how am i supposed to make a stopper so that the crank is precisely at 60 degrees when it hits it?
help 2021-06-21 07:34:57 <@!707953054489509978>my brains cant process so much math and physics

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:42:42 <:cirnokeikaku:820525612082921474>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 08:48:06 give it cat ears
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:49:07 also i made a v12 engine... sort of
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:50:20 definitely not something you can fit into a build
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:51:20 its also slightly buggy and it needs anchors to function smooth ish
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:52:32 <@!707953054489509978>whats that supposed to mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:52:57 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:53:44 ill give a peek
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:57:38 ignore the plane trying to fuse with the engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 08:59:30 not plane proof yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 09:03:35 probably never will
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 09:12:28 which one
help 2021-06-21 11:08:04 geez
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:12:09 why dont people use invisible signs more often?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:12:43 they arent
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:13:37 its my favourite block type due to its properties
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:14:13 i never see anyone use it
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:15:03 why
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:16:02 i just want some logical answer
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:47:39 I mean don't ask me, I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:49:41 I had dreams about building.... That's how hard I worked on my builds yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:50:15 Indeed
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:52:47 Idk doesn't stop me from building
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:08:59 The general chat is pretty darn toxic at the moment
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:12:38 I'd love to get inspiration from something but all I see is someone building the most simple truck with suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:13:17 Depends I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:14:58 Chinese junk carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:18:09 No idea what that is but I'm assuming that is true
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:53:29 Why does everyone make cars with rocket propulsion and propeller adjustment systems
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:54:33 Its lame
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:57:37 Yea but people with bigger cars do it too
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:58:07 It is?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:58:25 It can't be that hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:04:37 I wonder how people make cycling guns ðŸ¤”
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:04:53 I could try to make one
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:06:57 Not me
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:07:27 Because I'd never expect such a thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 14:23:48 Someone explain the weird mech trend
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 13:19:11 I tried to make a gun and it works but the energy transfer is disappointing
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 13:21:55 I could make a sniper cannon hybrid but idk if its a good idea because of the size
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:42:51 Yikes
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:44:31 That's a horn? Looks more like a pump to me than anything else
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:46:25 To me it's a pump.... Meanie
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:49:08 Pump
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:49:52 Compressor to be specific
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 18:50:51 A loud compressor
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:50:56 It's not bad. I mean yes it's ugly but it's functional
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:14:37 You doing plane crazy for a living
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:16:25 .... How do i interact with people?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:16:56 I'm depressed from being left out
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:17:48 I don't have anything to discuss
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:20:50 I don't even feel comfortable sharing my builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:22:13 No just very simple and ugly but functional
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:24:35 General is the definition of 10yr olds
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:30:20 Any ideas what piston engine type you would love to see? I'm not quite sure what to build
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:31:40 V8 is the only suggestion?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:32:45 I have issues fitting 6 cylinders in a row on the plot
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:33:12 What type of a rotary engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:35:47 I don't know how to make a rotary engine but I can make any piston engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:39:29 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 16:44:06 <:reimudoubt:651615695158902787>
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:39:35 The ranking system is very flawed in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:41:06 <:reimudoubt:651615695158902787>
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:43:13 I'm thinking of making a belt that prevents slipping more effectively
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:47:02 Both
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:48:01 Honestly I'd stick with something more unique you don't see everyday in planecrazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:33:12 I don't understand why no one uses signs
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:35:33 Why always cameras instead of signs
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:35:58 I want a logical answer
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:37:44 I mean yeah they are harder to place but they are superior in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:39:27 I see cameras on all builds regardless of the skill and detail
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:41:43 Text signs don't collide with anything so you can make all sorts of things from it such as the engines I make every once in a while and it doesn't look ugly regardless of the mode you are in
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:43:21 People laugh at my guestion every time I ask
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:44:32 Why is it so underused
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:44:45 Hi
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:45:24 I'm trying to satisfy my brains
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:49:11 Personally I don't care what it looks like long as it functions and it's made without using block by block tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:50:34 I respect people who make their own builds and don't copy something and act all arrogant in a public session
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:52:30 Unless you purposely annoy me or someone else.... Then you can rot under the bed until you grow up
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:54:02 Totally not referring to a earlier encounter with a "seizure" smoke machine
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:56:27 I'll try to take a nap so see ya guys
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:56:37 <:yuwusleep:617878455870029824>
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 22:56:16 Long as the game location stays the same it shouldn't affect it
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 22:59:02 Then again I'd rather listen to people whine than blast hardbass next to my plot...
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 23:14:23 Maybe if its lewd
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:34:32 You guys are plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 06:19:17 I've come to realise people are dumb
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 06:20:42 Which makes me question myself
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 06:23:37 Am I smart or is everyone just acting dumb?
general 2021-07-08 06:25:33 Whaa
general 2021-07-08 06:25:59 Yes
general 2021-07-08 06:26:12 Please do
general 2021-07-08 06:26:58 Nice rally car
general 2021-07-08 06:27:25 Looks like a 70s f1
general 2021-07-08 06:27:34 Kinda...
general 2021-07-08 06:27:41 No wait 80
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:40:33 What's with the bots
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:41:10 Weird
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:41:54 <:KannaWhat:785424088558338118>
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:43:30 The chat is full of scammers<:HinaFace:789196409978486796>
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:45:53 That's the pinnacle of arrogance
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:49:41 Looks like it flies
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:51:56 
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:52:47 Idk be a good boy
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:53:27 Yis
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:53:34 Big pat
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:55:39 I'm bad with gears
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:56:56 Also with the physics engine you can skip thermodynamics completely because roblox
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 22:42:21 UwU
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 22:43:14 This is serious math
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 22:44:49 Motor 3 is the cure for all the world's hunger
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 22:48:06 I wonder if I can make a road that's longer than the platform
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 11:25:05 how did you make it line up? just rng spawn?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 11:25:51 ah
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 11:27:22 the barrel could be a bit longer but otherwise i love it
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 11:29:03 looks alot smaller in picture
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 11:31:54 i want to make something amazing but my mind just isnt working today
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:01:28 Out of all the possible channels you could have whined on you chose this one
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:33:29 Hmm
help 2021-07-10 12:37:42 Any ideas how to make a custom gear piece that isn't a water wheel
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:40:13 B47 sounds amazing
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:41:26 Personally I like b52 stratofortress more
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:42:48 Idk but can you explain what the deal is with the cameras?
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:43:11 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:44:36 I've never seen a jet powered stratofortress in the game
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:46:53 Air is a form of gas
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:47:07 Or gasses ðŸ¤”
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 12:49:26 Finally I have a solution in my head
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 07:04:50 Looks like someone is getting a strike
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:00:48 I remember someone begging for help few days ago because his plane was banking right
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:01:44 His wings were completely off center and he was missing blocks on the body
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:02:14 I gave up
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:03:17 Yea sorry I'm bad with social interactions
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:04:37 I'll kiss the next guy on the lips
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:06:25 That's keeping homies close to you :)
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:07:18 Send proof
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:08:34 Then stop whining
general 2021-07-13 08:18:06 <:reimudoubt:651615695158902787>
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 08:34:53 I'm thinking about making a destructible model house or something like that... Any ideas what I should make?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 23:51:23 That's why I don't make mechs
help 2021-08-22 17:53:43 Uhh weird question but do you guys have any good ideas how to make a reuleaux triangle?
help 2021-08-22 17:55:05 Making a symmetrical triangle shape out of cubes seems like a pain
help 2022-01-03 09:27:37 Been a while since I last asked so has anyone figured out a way to build tracks that don't slip?
help 2022-01-03 09:30:56 I'm asking because I would love to build a working timing chain/belt for my engine model so I don't have to use a second motor to keep the valve timing correct
general 2022-01-03 10:26:48 Enough shredder bugs as it is
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 16:20:37 Imagine on topic conversations
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 11:20:16 imagine building lag machines
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 11:22:27 oh look a lag nuke and a ball shredder too
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 11:23:58 
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 11:24:27 is this how the universe was born?
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 11:30:43 ohh so thats how this game profits
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 22:44:10 What was the speed measurement again?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:55 The forbidden one time use shield
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:17:51 I lowkey want to make a build that abuses motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:20:45 What's with people making power generator builds?
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:21:58 No I mean the ones that have some spinning dark magic inside a box with a viewing room for it
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:25:05 Something like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:26:17 Yeah seems about right
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:26:59 All the ones I encounter are spinning discs or something with smoke and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:29:13 That burger sure is turbulent
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:30:01 Why
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 19:30:10 Why a cow
creations-chat 2022-02-20 17:16:40 
creations-chat 2022-02-20 17:18:48 oh no a furry plane how terrifying
creations-chat 2022-02-20 17:21:06 can i have that in english?

plane-crazy 2022-02-23 05:48:17 i cry inside whenever i see a build with cameras
general 2022-02-23 05:50:12 looks cool
general 2022-02-23 05:51:31 now make it cycle and reload automatically
general 2022-02-23 05:58:18 i would love to spread the use of invisible text signs if i could
general 2022-02-23 05:58:56 they are super useful
general 2022-02-23 06:00:16 the no hitbox properties are super useful
general 2022-02-23 06:02:11 they both have their own flaws

general 2022-02-23 06:18:56 Does anyone know if there is any detailed model engines that function?
general 2022-02-23 06:22:53 I really would love to have some kind of reference to challenge or something
general 2022-02-23 06:23:33 Making piston engines alone without any reference or ideas is very boring
general 2022-02-23 06:24:49 I'd love to
general 2022-02-23 06:25:22 I need ideas desperately
general 2022-02-23 06:26:15 I want to see how other people deal with the challenges of creating a working piston engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:13:57 what is the most recent and advanced shredder design?
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:14:13 ive been away for a while
