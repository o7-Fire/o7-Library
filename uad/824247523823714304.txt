general 2022-01-16 05:39:36 trying to talk to random people to level up

the-dump 2022-02-16 23:41:42 why does russia have german Tigers...
the-dump 2022-02-16 23:41:49 that scares me
general 2022-03-26 05:38:02 will there be longer wedges in the update? like 1x5, 1x6, etc
general 2022-03-26 05:38:22 i really hope they do
general 2022-03-26 05:38:36 not really
general 2022-03-26 05:38:53 atleast 1x6 max
general 2022-03-26 05:39:48 i would just like 1x5 and 1x6 wing wedge blocks
general 2022-03-26 05:40:53 also have larger wegde blocks would help with making builds more simple which in turn helps with lag
general 2022-03-26 05:41:04 more complex a build is, the more laggy it is
general 2022-03-26 05:41:13 motor lock make builds more complex
general 2022-03-26 05:55:08 cringe
