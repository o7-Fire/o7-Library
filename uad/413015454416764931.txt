plane-crazy 2020-11-01 17:34:57 If you don't have the dimensions right, the entire thing is ruined

fair enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 21:33:02 gonna remake the strato launcher and maybe the plane it dropped
creations-chat 2020-11-02 21:34:17 That ford pick up reminds me of the Ferrari "Breadvan" for some reason, mostly the back but that's a good build
creations-chat 2020-11-02 21:35:22 Reminds me of this lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 21:35:53 the fact there's no more outline is so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:07:12 I gave up on the stratolauncher, its body is that thin but itâ€™s so tall itâ€™s hard too make it look good
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:09:29 But now the problem is, what do I make now? Either a ship or aircraft would be best
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:10:53 Beluga would be cool I guess
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:11:31 or the Mig-21 lancer
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:11:49 aight
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:12:10 Iâ€™ll make a beluga after the bote then
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:17:24 a heavy lift ship looks cool af
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:17:31 might make that actually
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 23:21:22
