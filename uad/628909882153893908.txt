plane-crazy 2020-12-19 17:53:37 i love the wing to engine ratio
bot-central 2020-12-20 00:07:57 %suggest More wedges, middle half block, up and down wings, better locking missles.
bot-central 2020-12-20 00:14:55 &suggest More wedges. There's lots of wedge shapes we're missing out on, like bigger pyramids, Wedge beam 2.Middle half block. This would be a nice option. They can be used as tray tables for airliners!U p and down wings. This would remove the need to motor lock some builds. Plus allowing us to use wings as thinner half blocks would be nice. Better locking missles. They almost NEVER lock on. This is the reason dogfights are so broken. I sat for around 15 minutes in a dogfight to kill 2 PLANE. There needs to be a change. I end up leaving the game for Neo Warfare instead, after the bad dogfighting. The 15 minutes aren't even fun, it's just bad cat and mouse. I really want this in the game.
bot-central 2020-12-20 00:16:01 whops
