plane-crazy 2019-01-06 01:58:32 is it possible to reach 800 speed in-game? The fastest I've gone is 669 with more than 10 super rocket engines in a dive
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 01:58:43 my plane goes so fast the turn radius is the size of texas
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 01:58:55 jesus

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 04:26:33 Does centrifugal force count as horizontal movement or no?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:22:36 How good is a UFO build with a shit ton of rocket boosters?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:24:04 Personally I like really small interceptor builds that accelerate quickly, have a high climb rate, fast dive, even in exchange for really wide turns
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:24:26 nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:24:49 I like small planes because they're harder to hit
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:25:02 it also lowers build time
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:25:54 a fun thing to do in non-pvp mode is to put a camera in a rocket, leave your pilot seat on the ground, and send the rocket to space
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:26:25 yeah that too
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:40:35 let me just make a plane shaped like a phallus
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:40:36 kek
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:40:58 *totally not the MD-80*
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:49:14 it's fun to make hard points in the middle of your wing by replacing wing panels with half-blocks, so you can attach bombs/rockets to them
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:49:49 it also helps in balancing out a delta-wing design so it doesn't pitch too far forward due to all the lift being in the rear
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:50:02 It's a P-51D
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:50:18 D because A and B variants don't have full plexiglass canopy
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 08:50:29 Smae goes for C variants
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 17:42:42 I'm so retarded
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 17:42:58 I spent the past day and a half just blind firing rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 17:43:19 when i could've put a camerain  the nose of my jet to aim
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 17:46:54 it'd be nice if rockets move at their set speed+the speed of your aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:35 rockets fly too dang slow
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:53 sometimes when i try to do a ground attack, my rockets glitcht out my plane because they get stuck in their launchers
creations-chat 2019-01-06 23:59:35 Thrust SSC going really fast
creations-chat 2019-01-06 23:59:44 even though i built it facing the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:02:19 i hate going into a dogfight when your plane is so fast your rockets fly behind it
creations-chat 2019-01-07 19:09:00 I have reached escape velocity

creations-chat 2019-01-07 19:09:30 light speed
creations-chat 2019-01-07 19:10:08 max I could reach was escape velocity with my retarded magnet drive

creations-chat 2019-01-08 05:30:21 Very low quality demonstration of the Aiming system.
help 2019-01-08 05:50:57 just have a spring under the seat, have it remove welds, and make sure no other blocks connect to the seat that are attached to the plane
help 2019-01-08 05:51:57 and hold down the activation key, or else your seat won't properly fly out
help 2019-01-08 05:52:47 also we're not able to open parachutes while seated anymore
help 2019-01-08 05:53:04 and sometimes you fly so fast that your seat may get caught on the stabiliser
help 2019-01-08 05:53:31 in the cold war, this was fixed by having pilots eject downwards, but at a much higher altitude
help 2019-01-08 05:53:52 you can also attach a helium  block to the ejection seat to help it make clearance

creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:12:45 The AD-4 has 411 parts, and comes with all 12 rockets allowed in-game, and 4 wing-mounted guns. Any replicator rank pls
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:13:48 ok
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:13:56 a lot of planes here have that function
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:14:00 even boats
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:14:29 You could probably land on a carrier with this lane, if you flew slow enough
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:15:50 It has a stall speed of around 100 sps, and it might be able to land on a carrier that's 14 blocks wide, assuming there's no control tower
help 2019-01-08 06:18:58 it welds stuff to it
help 2019-01-08 06:19:45 if there doesn't appear to be a weld in front of it, and a loose object is in front of the red welding part, and within range, it welds the loose part to the magnet when the magnet is activated
creations-chat 2019-01-08 06:22:03 also escape velocity pls

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 02:04:19 I wish we had panel blocks that could allow us to build thinner planes like the P-51
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 02:04:28 imagine half blocks but super thin
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 02:04:57 or what about more variations to piston engines, like V12s and 24-cylinder rotaries?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 02:05:45 really large engine used by a lot of piston fighter aircraft

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:02:46 keep the design to yourself
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:02:58 if someone wants to make one, they can toil over their own reference material
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:18:59 I hate how the moment a wheel/winter wheel comes into contact with even the slightest hill, it just goes to a stop, especially on large, heavier builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:23:09 simple but really large
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:24:42 spaced armor
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:24:57 Works well against shaped charges and APCR rounds
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:25:09 it's still used today actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:25:14 most MBT have spaced armor
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:25:27 but also use different materials in it to make composite armor
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:25:39 yep
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:26:28 I tried to keep the size down on my Panther
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:26:43 and I had to substitue blocks because some were broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:26:55 the color is badly implemented german camoflauge

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:28:18 maus hella thicc
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:28:43 does your maus have a turret that can traverse/have gun elevation?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:29:41 nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:30:20 I basically made the panther to work as a target for other PVP builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:30:36 it doesn't move very fast, but the turret traverse is just good enough where you can shoot down planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:31:43 epic fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:31:54 someone should make a giant ben shapiro

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:46:15 otherwise, most tanks excluding light tanks and MBTs don't go over 30 mph
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:46:28 most light tanks pre-WWII only went up to 35 mph
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:46:37 the M18 was, and still is the fastest tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:46:48 BT-7 holds the wrld record for longest distance jumped in a tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:46:54 not the fastest max speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:47:26 they're about equal in terms of speed tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:47:36 the bismarck doesn't go over 30 kts
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:47:46 BT5 at max can go 35 mph on road
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:48:06 M18 Hellcat is still the fastest tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:48:11 the Abrams is close, but not quite
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 08:48:40 M18 hellcat goes 80 km/h on road

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 16:56:43 whenever I put the center of lift over the center of mass, I find the vehicle has a tendency to violently pitch up at higher speeds (500 sps), or even when taking off
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 16:56:59 it does suffer with poor glide performance at low speed however
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 16:57:17 I have it like 2-3 blocks behind
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 16:57:28 it works out for me when flying PVP
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 16:58:40 I don't like it to naturally pitch up, because when I'm engaging someone at lower altitude than me, mouse control doesn't allow you to roll over and pitch down

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 19:20:02 basically uou could make a helicopter with ballast depth charges and use the camera to find subs in the water
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 19:20:15 and manually explode the explosive blocks when it makes contact

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 19:22:41 I'd rather manually drip, they're more compact that way
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 19:23:07 basically set up the length of the rope, detach, and wait for a sub to touch them, manually explode them on contact
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 19:23:23 you can set number keybinds in order to explode them one-by-one

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 06:55:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 06:56:01 in block category
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 06:56:04 as their own special tab
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:36:13 imagine a 1x7 beam
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:36:28 except the tip pokes out of your build square while building
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:37:04 multiblock object= a single part taking up more than one block of space
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:37:28 because it makes sense when categorizing objects
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:38:04 there's also 1x4 beams, half beams, ballast beams, helium beams,and wedges larger than 1x2
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:38:30 1x4 wedge isn't technically a beam
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:38:38 it's just an elongated wedge
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:39:01 i know
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:39:10 but it takes up more than one block of space

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:40:47 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:41:03 seats are 1x2, and are not beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:41:11 I'm saying they are multiblock objects
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:41:13 not beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:41:40 multiblock object->category of block->exact block
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:42:10 it's like how a square is a rectange but a rectangle isn't a square

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 05:58:59 has anyone actually made a stable skydiiving aircraft?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 05:59:10 who
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 05:59:16 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 05:59:42 I meant an actual aircraft that at least doesn't look like a shoebox with rocket engines and crafting stick wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:00:15 I'm talknig like a semi-purpose built skydiving platform, with a side/back door where passengers can jump from
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:03:01 Does parachuting in your seat only work on private servers?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:03:10 Bcause I can't do it and I joined a public server

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:03:46 The seat's still welded
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:03:56 not disconnected or attached to a spring
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:04:02 I'll try that
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:04:20 ohh neat idea: detachable passenger cabin that can roll out the back
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:04:37 like you open the back up, and the seats fly out
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:08:01 Tried using a disconnector, still won't work
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 06:08:39 yeah, gotta use a spring
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 18:37:04 yo does the center of mass in ypur aircraft dynamically change as you move/detach stuff from it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 19:16:19 Can I get an F in the chat for my DC-3 Dakota that was lost to a saving glitch?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:13:02 did the U2 Dragon lady have a flexible reconnasaince camera mount?

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:15:32 not even a copy
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:15:41 it's based of the frnech/british jaguar
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:17:06 "designed off of the T-2 trainer, based on the SEPECAT Jaguar"
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:17:38 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_F-1
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:18:10 they did triels of the F-5 and the jaguar, and made their own aircraft base od the performance of both
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:19:21 
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:20:05 I agree with you there
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:20:56 looks somewhere inbetween the F-22 and F-35
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:21:46 Ki-61 looms more german
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:21:59 no shit
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:22:06 the japanese and germans were allies
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:22:17 and the japs focused on naval researxh, so they outsourced ground and air
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:23:48 tou shouldn't care if they copy if they have a liscense for production, or are allies with the country of origin, as having allies keep up with standards is more important than being unique
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:24:07 don't want your allies to be like WWII italy
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 21:24:18 unprepared and behind the times
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:43:26 just build a big deck, make it high up
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:43:26 use a lot of engines and ballast
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:43:28 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:45:11 Made an AGM that flies pretty straight, trades locking function of the PVP rocket for damage, speed, and the fact that it can't reload. It moves pretty quickly, and it's based off of a torpedo design
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:46:02 people would buy that
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:46:20 maybe for like 2k at most
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:46:30 but if people want it they'll buy it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:46:55 yea
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:47:04 but there's a height limit
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:47:09 so folding is still limited
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:47:55 for 9k, you won't have many buyers, but someone might buy it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:48:07 maybe at like 1.5k-2k, there'll be a bit more
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:48:45 building big causes lag, so extra space shouldn't come cheap
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:16 but not many people outside devs and traders can freely spend 10k robux on a game
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:32 I'd say no less than 500 but no more than 2.5k
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:51:03 yo can we get a glass block that has an embedded reflex aiming reticle?

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:23 imagine making the tipjar an engine
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:35 that's even more powerful than rocket engines

plane-crazy 2019-04-16 15:34:37 like half the players have Anti-Air or suicide cars, and the other half are AFK or roleplaying
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 15:35:19 it's so easy to clear out a pvp server by just denying anyone from taking off by ripping them in half with all 10 pvp guns
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 15:35:59 also gondola

plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:43:24 remember, if you put the same arming keybind for all the explosive balls, you'll arm all of them at the same time, which might cause your build to self-destruct if they have an impact fuse/get tossed around a little bit

plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:36:41 I added 5 more rockets so it raches 590 SPS in a straight
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:36:55 it also does turns at 480 sps now
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:37:20 yep
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:37:32 a metric fuckton
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:37:42 i replaced a lot of half blocks with wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:38:03 yep
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:38:28 I don't use my main pilot seat in the aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:38:39 I use a regular pilot seat painted to look like the main one
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:38:51 the seat allows you to go inverted and pulll tighter turns
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:38:56 I spawn on the fake runway I made
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:39:26 basically the MPS (main pilot seat) limits your roll, but if you take away that limit, you can achieve tighter manuevers
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:39:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:39:52 I turned a P-80 into a drone
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:39:57 and put a pilot seat in the drone
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:11 lo and behold, I could do loops without br0ken motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:19 your roll
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:22 you can't go inverted
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:31 there's yaw, pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:48 both
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:40:54 without motors, you can't go upside down
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:00 but motors break
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:11 so the pilot seat switcheroo works better
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:30 (pilot seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:36 not a normal seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:41:52 then try it
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 07:42:06 take a plane, put your main pilot seat on the ground, and put a reg pilot seat in the plane

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 07:42:36 pvp is either noobs who are trying out weapons for the first time, low-quality builders who finally found out super rockets are really good in high quantity, and builders who seek to destroy everyone else's creation the moment anyone tries to get out of their plot
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 07:43:09 sometimes the builders stick pvp weapons on a nice creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 07:43:19 sometimes the builders build their creation around pvp
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 07:43:41 i've found ways to cram all 10 pvp guns in a single build without t looking like doodoo

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 09:42:44 love-hate relationship with the tomcat: it's a good fighter, but it moves so fast that any scenic screenshot opportunity is gone in a second, as you're already halfway across the map by then
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 09:43:36 especially hard to screenshot when you're also trying to keep the craft from crashing inverted/getting stuck since it can't use the flip button to flip back over
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 09:46:12 another gripe: it tends to snowball into a roll/dive when not costantly corrected
creations-chat 2019-05-19 14:40:26 <@!427466925275217931> put your main pilot seat on the ground and put a regular pilot seat in the plane itself, then try flying it

plane-crazy 2019-06-19 15:47:13 what's that principle or theory about transonic flight where you place your center of gravity in front of your center of lift so shockwaves don't form till later?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 15:53:40 all i know is that I learned about it a while back, forgot the name of it, but it keeps my magnet drive plane from wobbling too much
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 15:53:59 it's also the reason why delta wings exist I guess

bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:24 such as the liberty to bear arms, secede, self-govern, run a business, etc.
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:45 items that impede such liberty include licensing, taxing, and regulation

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:26:13 grades 1-12
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:26:31 also my high school has a metric fuckton of classes
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:27:09 from agricultural science, physics, BC calculus, wolrd history AP, european history AP, US history AP, human geography AP, etc.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:27:35 took spanish for 2 years
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:28:11 spanish because southern neighbors, and french because you can basically go anywhere in europe with only knowing french and english
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:28:31 my highschool also has german, chinese, and ASL
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:29:08 english is a lingua franca, so there's not much of a need to learn another language unless you plan to move to another country
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:29:25 bruh I could literally fly to japan for free on first class
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:29:32 I just don't because I don't like the food over there
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:29:45 I'd rather go to france and enjoy a nice steak for 25 euros
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:30:05 bruh I don't even need to pay for a flight
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:30:14 and I stopped taking LOTE
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:37:28 I don't pay for a flight, as in non-rev
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:37:32 non-rev flying
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 01:38:02 if you play your cards right, and get on the standby list for a flight early-on, you can fly in business or first class for free

general 2019-09-14 18:22:34 since both bernard and alfred do not know initially, you'd have to eliminate any trakcs with unique number designations, removing tracks a and b, due to lines 5 and 6 being unique to them
general 2019-09-14 18:23:24 since bernard now knows, and alfred doesn't, eliminate line 1 because there's 2 choices there
general 2019-09-14 18:23:44 finally, since alfred now knows too, eliminate line D, since tehre is also another 2 choices there
general 2019-09-14 18:23:47 correct answer is C3

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:38:07 good PCs go for around 1500 USD
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:38:28 not if you buy from best buy
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:38:31 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:38:44 no even prebuilt
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:38:47 individual parts
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:39:03 most expensive part had to be the monitor or the graphics card tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:39:11 2070 super for the card
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:40:00 oh yeah yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:41:03 lmao it's 700 USD
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:41:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:42:03 tbh I've spent more money on firearms than I have my PC
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:42:36 900 USD for the M1, on top of several hundred dollars for ammunition, as well as my Sig P320, and ammunition for that too
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:43:03 I pretty much got all my parts from best buy
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:43:09 however microcenter has better prices
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:43:26 https://www.microcenter.com/
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:43:35 amazon sometimes has good prices
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:44:15 last time I built my PC I had to "recover" windows 10 and update the BIOS vie flash drive
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:45:00 wait until after christmas
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:45:12 it's like a 2nd black friday because retailers put things on sale to clear out stock

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:45:44 I've got the ryzen 7 3700X
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:46:08 what about graphics card?
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:46:25 RTX 2070 super, aforemention
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:46:27 *ed

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:46:53 also samsung 1tb SSD
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:46:58 on top my old 1TB HDD
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:47:07 lit my guy
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 19:47:17 I'm just hoping this PC lasts for another 8 years
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 20:43:00 what was teh activation key for smoke pipes again?

plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:36:40 Cannon looks dumb because it's a 75 behind somewhere close to 18 cm of armor
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:37:31 the picture you posted is a VVSS M4, with pronounced hull crew position bulges and the aforementioned VVSS suspention with thinner tracks
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:38:03 M4A3E2 is a chonker already, and the Horizontal Volute Suspension System makes for wider tracks and lower ground pressure
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:38:48 basically the turret of this thick lad
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:39:20 On this hull
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:40:50 also the bogies are smack-dab next to each other on the HVSS
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:44:30 don't forget the doubled road wheels too
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:49:39 and if you think the angles are bad, then look at purified's super sherman
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:50:28 both their's and the hull I made have similar angles in terms of the upper glacis as well as the read deck

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 09:41:58 ok schizo
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 03:57:38 oh
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:49:55 105 time
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:50:04 different sherman than the jumbo
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:50:14 also improved engine deck
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:50:58 M4 could be outfitted with extra chonk armor, 75mm, 76mm, 105mm, HVSS suspension, and different hull makes corresponding to engine type
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:51:11 firefly had 17 pdr, which is 76mm, but not american 76
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:51:31 not including postwar super sherman variants
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:51:35 yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:52:14 105mm muzzle ended at end of hull
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:52:21 adequate length given reference
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:52:30 75mm went past hull by a little bit
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 04:52:34 76 was l o n g
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:01:43 hasty 75 conversion
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:02:04 could possibly make it a firefly
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:02:53 earlier turret was too small
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:02:59 increased radius by 1 block'
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:03:46 kinda chonk from the top and front
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:04:33 it'd probably look better 1 block shorter
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:13:29 hull height is different between hull models, obviously, but I'll eventually get to making the bogeys taller
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:13:38 
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:16:29 orginal is bruh
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 05:16:44 also might update engine deck on jumbo
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 06:25:25 HVSS suspension is probably closer to IRL ride height, it's just a tad bit compact
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 06:26:05 also small turret

creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:31 red baron may have worn a scarf back in the day, but not that yuge
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:47 because air gets cold when you move fast
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:53 and gets colder the higher you go
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:57 especially in europe
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:43:04 hence thicc clothes
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:43:41 90 mph is still pretty fast
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:43:47 highway speeds right there
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:08 you ever stick your hand out the window on the freeway?
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:24 also highway isn't 100+ feet of the ground
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:39 you could probably expect at most like 2000 ft operational altitude at the time
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:45 which can be pretty chilly
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:02 also the scarf doesn't compare to the thicc flight cap and tunic
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:12 it's a creature comfort pretty much
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:35 minimum safe altitude before oxygen requirement is 12500
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:50 and with a lawnmower engine and canvas airfoil, getting up that high takes literal hours
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:58 on paper
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:04 doubt the pilot would last long
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:13 especially because it takes forever to get that high
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:17 especially at highway speeds
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:56 max altitude you can expect when your goal is to take photos, and shoot pilots is at most 5000 feet
creations-chat 2020-02-22 09:11:04 i see that <@!500443537389912074> has been working hard on his tank, so I've come to update you folks with a more proportional M4A3, with lower hull and slightly smaller turret. More details may or may not be added

plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:33:19 let's not talk about all the theoretical work the game's scripting needs in order to minimize lag
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:33:42 theoretical because I assume it's at the limit of efficiency the devs can handle
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:34:11 some folks claim the game is too easy to exploit in
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:36:10 most of the lag probably arises from too many moving parts in a build being updated
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:36:30 tbh I'd be fine with starting anew
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:36:41 opportunity to build better
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:37:21 if game isn't rewritten, a new game with better scripting could be made
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:37:35 it'd probably make more sense organizationally
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:38:01 no need to decipher old code when new one can be made
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:38:15 old framework can be used for troubleshooting and examples
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:38:33 new game = more opportunity to build new things
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:39:42 a bigger dev team might be necessary for a rewrite though
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:39:59 having only 2 lads doing the development work must be stressful
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:41:00 it's up to who the current devs may or may not hire
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:41:29 not having to pick through old code that was made while the rick was learning how to code
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:42:12 being able to start with better organized scripts while using the old game for troubleshooting when needed
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:42:19 also generate hype
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:43:01 hupe up players with a new game
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:44:42 og players get a potentially better scripted game with less lag and more features

plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:48:09 old strv
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:48:16 had no semblance of actual suspension
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:48:21 yeah it had working depression
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:48:27 used ropes+suspension springs
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:48:55 however tensioning system was bruh because the front/rear rollers didn't lock in place
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:49:31 protoype before paints/details
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:49:50 I use magnets because they weld
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:57 I just use normal pistons+ magnets since the extension is more moderate
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:10 the jarring extension of locked motors might break the tracks
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:14 hence pistons

creations-chat 2020-02-25 04:51:52 very nice though
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 06:18:47 prototype "torsion bar" suspension, it just uses suspension springs+motors to simulate the actual bar resetting. It's probably close the christie style suspension
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 06:21:54 using quotes not to denote uniqueness, but the poor attempt at recreation

general 2020-02-25 07:59:55 tbh le bote balancing could be fixed if ships had limited sight range, and if AA was nerfed in terms of accuracy depending on speed and size of vessel. This could also give use to carriers, as they could send planes out which mark enemies with a ping if spotted, allowing more coordination. This could perhaps be expanded into a sonar/radar system to integrate subs, destroyers, and more
general 2020-02-25 08:00:14 basically make le bote into a whole different game
general 2020-02-25 08:01:45 not limited range, limited sight range
general 2020-02-25 08:01:55 as in you can't see everything at once
general 2020-02-25 08:02:33 what nonce thought that BBs should get AS?
general 2020-02-25 08:02:47 Also AA seems kinda OP if it's that good
general 2020-02-25 08:03:14 even CIWS isn't all that laser accurate, it's literally the last line of defense against incoming projectiles
general 2020-02-25 08:03:32 it's the equivalent of trying to swat a wasp with your hand
general 2020-02-25 08:04:06 nope
general 2020-02-25 08:04:09 not at all
general 2020-02-25 08:04:16 no torps, no depth charges, no sonar
general 2020-02-25 08:04:26 that's destroyer's job
general 2020-02-25 08:04:39 Not even the Iowa had 'em
general 2020-02-25 08:04:46 nd it got nuke rounds and tomahawks
general 2020-02-25 08:06:46 biggest reason why BBs had no AS capabilities was dur to lack of space
general 2020-02-25 08:07:00 big turrets had big magazines and big powder stowages
general 2020-02-25 08:07:23 taking up most of belowdecks, close to space engine takes
general 2020-02-25 08:07:49 superstructure housed rangefinding equipment, main purpose was to sling big iron across ocean
general 2020-02-25 08:08:31 imagine if there were repair costs
general 2020-02-25 08:08:46 and fuel/ammo system where they had to be replenished at cost of currency
general 2020-02-25 08:08:55 add currency to neuter BB players
general 2020-02-25 08:09:50 higher tonnage ships killed compared to personal tonnage=greater reward to entice usage of smaller bote
general 2020-02-25 08:10:05 ther eis

plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:06:21 and q/e for elevators

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 07:03:04 because max deck space is needed for safe flight operations
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 07:03:20 while deck space must also be allotted for the ship's weaponry

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:48:38 oh wow look at this guy he watched a 30 minute video on how to make an outdated build
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:48:49 love seeing the same F-22 in every other pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:03 watch him reach a max speed of 200 studs per second tops
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:31 because good builds beget good opinions
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:57 >segregation wont' really change much
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:09 pro bot
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:34 majority of people have done a tutorial at some point
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:40 you've got to learn the game somehow
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:49 >starter tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:54 >friend walking you through how to play
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:51:00 >just putting stuff down until it works
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:51:37 but yeah people that expect praise and backpats for copying someone elses work will be unkindly reprimanded for doing so
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:52:22 I just made double wishbone based on my knowledge of double wishbone
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:52:43 it works but it's shit because it freezes up when steering rack is operating
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:53:03 could get into linkages but I'm not that much into spending 30 minutes to build a car
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:53:30 no it's the idea of being praise for being creative, and putting in the skill and effort to stand out
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:54:14 make T-64 with working treads and suspension + tnt armor and ERA
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:54:15 pro
creations-chat 2020-12-08 03:55:20 no but he's a janitor and he does it for free
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:57:12 <#627195143040139264> and the creations channels exist so that creativity and skill are praised and promoted, while people learning how to build can get advice to make a good build great
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:57:22 and that's just reshade
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:57:51 but don't expect good feedback when you put a copied tutorial build in creations
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:58:10 hall of fame placement is based partly on community input and partly on staff
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:58:20 it first has to reach a certain number of upvotes then it's voted on by staff
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 04:02:04 iowa bow is also different too
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 04:02:15 iowa bridge has different shape on top of that
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 04:03:07 lol jk the iowa bridge is pretty low on the island
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 04:03:33 but yeah iowa smokestack 1 is right behind the citadel

plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:31:42 might as well motor lock the rockets too
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:32:22 did you at least put hover engine/conveyor engine in it
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:32:52 only 600
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:32:53 dang
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:33:04 framerate cap moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:33:50 got the stable frames and the high top speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:34:03 could be faster but there's only so much you can fit in a 1x7 space
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:34:56 better example is this tiny thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:34:59 shakes past 2200
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 06:36:02 so I stand corrected

plane-crazy 2021-03-10 03:01:23 sad that the update that got rolled back finally separated build's velocity from framerate
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 03:01:36 back to wobbling above 1.2k sps

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 04:11:51 >moving parts separate from the vehicle now once again cut your speed and framerate down by 3/4th indicated
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 04:12:15 no longer actually hitting 150 sps in tracked vehicles
