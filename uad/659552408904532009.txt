creations-chat 2020-06-20 22:39:24 I wanted to post things in <#384025409945337856> but everything i do sux
If I do something functional, it won't look good
If I do something that looks good, it won't be functional

creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:25:58 Something definitely is wrong
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:30:22 How in the f people create artificial zero gravity?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:30:33 Ingame
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:30:57 Guys
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:31:06 People create global zero gravity
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:31:10 Without gamepass
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:32:19 I'll try to do a zero gravity chamber with magnets
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:32:38 I don't have robux
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:33:00 I'm so poor that I don't even have the free items lmao
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:33:26 I can't join vip server tho
help 2020-06-21 00:18:58 <@317063655520993280> magnet engines
help 2020-06-21 00:19:06 Downsides: bad turning
help 2020-06-21 00:19:15 Easy to fix tho
help 2020-06-21 00:19:27 You can configure the acceleration
creations-chat 2020-06-21 00:24:12 Might put a conveyor engine on Lightspeed and call it "hyperspace"
creations-chat 2020-06-21 00:26:43 Conveyor engines seems to be better for turning
creations-chat 2020-06-21 00:26:50 And more stable then magnet ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:38:04 How
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:38:06 Why
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:38:08 When
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:40:09 Anyone wanna achieve existential no at speed of light times 50?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:40:31 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:41:14 I did it with 100 magnet engines last time
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:41:24 Now that i know conveyor technology
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:41:27 Oh boy
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:41:29 The potential

plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:48:43 <:IntendedFeatureX:706289545250996235> wtf is this
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:48:49 <:IntendedFeatureX:706289545250996235>
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:49:11 Never saw/used one
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:49:14 What it does?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:49:54 > put a motor in locked with the config tool
<@577604979909459989> k I'll try
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:54:29 Can you compact conveyor engines?
<@577604979909459989>
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:55:44 I was thinking about compacting like, 5 of those into 1 to achieve Infinity Speed
https://youtu.be/ZQvsCB9CJsw
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:56:39 > proto's vid on conveyor engine better
<@429826358827417601> his one is away too big tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:56:55 Brikzay's is smaller
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:57:37 What motors can you compress?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:57:46 The 2x2 hovers?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:57:57 With cameras
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:58:09 > smash 100 hover thrusters into 1 block space
<@429826358827417601> oh boy
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:58:19 You don't know the monster you're creating
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:59:00 I'll end up crashing a server for being faster then the server itself
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:59:59 > u can go infinite speed and not crash
<@577604979909459989> 
Are you sure about that?<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:00:52 Ok so the hover engine setup is

Camera - Camera
Half Block - Hover

?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:09:31 For some reason I can't compact blocks with locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:10:41 Pokeballs
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:10:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:15:30 I give up
Block compressing simply doesn't work for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 12:56:42 Anyone have a print of the height distortion?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:31:24 If I copy someone's build but make my own modifications to it, does it still break the rule?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:34:02 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:34:12 I thought that copying others was against the rules
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:37:16 Btw, are the proportions on this right? Idk why but it feels kinda weird
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:37:48 The wings aren't like the original btw, because it wouldn't fly otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:38:13 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:38:22 I used this as reference
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:40:08 I guess the nose is kinda short
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:41:26 I'll try
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:42:01 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:43:34 I just realized something
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:44:03 I can make it look better by using half wedge at the start of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:44:30 
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:44:55 I'm googling some different angles
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:46:39 The nose is completely wrong oof
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:48:25 
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:08:30 I changed the wings, already looks better bruh
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:08:45 I think I'll motor lock the thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:08:51 To make the black thingy
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:10:13 Btw I'll be changing the "blasters" on the wings later
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:10:29 I wanna make it actually shoot, dk how
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:33:43 <@459442244265705504> made the blasters THICC and also some little changes, basically it's the 2.0 version

And it still flies
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:34:05 I also added the small lines below the big one
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:34:50 Next I'll do the back of it
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:35:05 Because it's still a hole <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:36:43 And I need to make the flying smoother
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:36:55 It's just hard to get up and down, besides that it's all fine
creations-chat 2021-03-13 19:02:14 Idk how to make it smaller, I also realized that it was too big but there wasn't anything I could do lol

The cylinders would be oversized if I made the rest smaller

Oh I'll try that then, thanks
creations-chat 2021-03-13 19:35:30 <@625224427369660416> ?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 20:28:53 Haha smoll go brrr
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:30:29 Why this mf spins like a beyblade when I try flying it? (I'm only using 2 of the 8 engines)
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:31:37 Oooh I know, is it too light?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 22:07:56 Gun, where?<:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 16:07:13 Anyone got an ps I can use? Public servers are lagging way too much for my potato phone
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:21:23 lol
