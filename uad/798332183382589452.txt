Using autohotkey I was able to make this action done with one keybind. Although it works well I dislike having a tutorial missile on my build. Problem is the tutorial missile is the most compact guided missile

creations-chat 2023-07-05 18:25:42 City of Tama
creations-chat 2023-07-05 18:33:04 Naw
creations-chat 2023-07-05 18:41:23 But looks great keep it up
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:37:31 <@885774611424358410> the cage is a good touch but it has too many layers one or two at most would look well
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:39:53 If u want missile defense add a spinning “radar” (trails/ladder) it works like a charm to throw off missiles. instead of tanking the damage with possible destruction to the build, it’ll redirect the middle somewhere else.
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:42:04 Oh so ur looking for effectiveness and design, that concept is for effectiveness, looks shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:42:56 <@885774611424358410> wdym scatter rockets?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:43:49 He’s prolly talking abt motoocked builds “unlocking” when it gets shot and the tnt parts coming/glitching out
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:08 Oh like custom missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:10 Not the default
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:18 I see
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:25 Then the cage is perfect for that
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:29 Yes I see
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:44 My bad for the misunderstanding
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:45:18 The missiles track to the firework particle?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:45:28 <@906201415247093780> talk here
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:46:17 <@885774611424358410> I think fireworks can *destroy* incoming custom missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:46:24 But never redirect default missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:46:37 Never seen that happen
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:46:59 Yeah like *moving out of the way*
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:48:04 No fucking shot
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:48:12 Standing my ground till further evidence
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:48:28 Oh that’s bc of lag
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:48:31 Lag/glitch
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:48:40 Aight man
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:14 Prove to me fireworks redirect missiles Im on a plane so I can’t
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:22 Then I’ll believe you and apologize for the mistake
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:29 Until then I’m chillin
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:53 Fireworks are overpowered
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:50:05 I love using them
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:50:15 They’re like if missiles and guns had a baby
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:11 Dawg how am I supposed to say this
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:20 I’m on a **plane**
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:23 I can’t
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:47 What are aps?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:52:16 I see
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:52:36 Y’all know namnams magnetic tnt ball launcher right
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:05 I repurposed them to shoot regular balls but I shoot them towards missiles (default) coming at me to redirect
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:10 They work 100% of the time
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:23 Downside is they are fragile and clunky
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:53 Cage is 100% viable option to defend against custom rockets
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:19 Although swarms, clusters, cluster bombs are a diff story
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:55 It’s just a protective measure of course it won’t work 100% of the time
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:56:08 I was going to say, it’s prolly not going to work for bombs/ missiles at ground level
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:56:25 But angled upwards, missives have a higher chance hitting the cage
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:57:18 Dawg I can make a 2x5 version of that
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:57:35 If it’s moving relatively fast
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:01 For a tank (subject of the conversation) I think it’s better off going for the “main body”
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:08 Instead of “in front” of it
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:26 MPS
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:33 Manual protection system
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:59:11 They are the bane of cages
