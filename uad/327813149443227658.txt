creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:38:47 has anyone made a hover thruster suspension system yet?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:47:25 just horrible
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:47:39 kill it
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:52:55 speaking of everything
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:52:57 at all
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:52:57 has anyone
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:53:02 tried to make hover thruster suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:54:55 is no one gonna answer me? so no one at all has tried it?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 02:55:05 **dibs**
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:31:08 if anyone makes working hover thruster suspension that actually works good, i'll do, something.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:31:37 no
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:31:40 a suspension chassis
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:31:47 that uses hover thrusters
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:32:01 as the springs, but you need to use springs, they just cant have any stiffness
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:32:22 no it is.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:32:23 its just very hard
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:32:28 i was very close to it
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:36:26 dont have enough time, get a double wishbone suspension and put a hover pad on the suspension, a block above it, but the block has to be connected to the body
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:36:33 my mistake was that i put the pad and the block on the suspension arm
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:36:44 so it didnt push the body up
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:36:54 but ive got to go right now
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:37:08 you can experiment if you want
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:37:11 its definitely possible
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:37:12 just tricky
creations-chat 2020-09-15 03:42:22 sameul if you manage to make a working one, you can just @ me tomorrow or tonight
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:19:14 I always see people building good looking things, but no one ever builds really technical things
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:19:35 mechanism
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:19:36 s
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:19:40 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:20:09 like ive been trying to make a hover pad suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:20:11 for a while now
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:27:46 oh my god
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:27:49 i accidentally made camber
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:27:59 trying to make a hover suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:29:07 negative camber too
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:29:19 
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:29:51 
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:30:06 literally accidentally made camber
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:30:28 its adjustable too
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:30:31 <:PogChamp:516298810700464128>
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:30:55 only thing i did was make the motors at the top
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:30:58 of the suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:31:00 powered
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:31:07 also

creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:31:18 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:31:53 ok those are technical terms
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:32:00 im not familiar with
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:32:05 im just happy i accidentally made camber
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:32:46 so its literally just what it sounds like
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:32:48 put a bar
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:33:03 that attaches both of the suspensions?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:33:18 k.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:33:27 okay but im still confused
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:33:31 where are your bars attached
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:34:13 thats a lot of motors
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:34:48 thats what i used
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:19 good enoguh
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:20 ca
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:27 good. enough/
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:40 you broke it
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:37:16 all your bar did was make my thing very very very very stiff
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:38:09 all it really did was fix my issues with my suspension flinging up and down once on full release
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:38:23 or atleast my entire suspension system
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:38:33 the arms would fling around once it got released
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:38:55 wym?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:39:32 wtf
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:39:32 no i wanted camber
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:39:33 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:39:38 but thanks for the info
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:39:46 now i know why my suspension is so springy, too springy.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:07 wait what the hell
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:13 FT
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:22 you know the motors i used for camber right?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:30 when i deleted those the suspension got really really springy
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:38 the motors up there are the only reason its not so bouncy
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:41 wtf
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:43:47 how does that work when they're locked
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:44:13 ok let me get a clip

creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:44:26 i might not be able to get a clip
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:44:48 k
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:44:49 lol
help 2020-09-17 00:25:35 why cant i suggest nothing
general 2020-09-18 22:06:17 if anyone wants to join my among us game dm me
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:45:59 Ok, i need some help with a hover thruster chassis im trying to make.
This is what it looks like (picture 1)

A fairly simple design, just has one bar holding both thruster pads, when in the air it takes an upside down V shape on the arms. (pic 2)

But when I start driving, the front pops up like its catching way too much air and doesnt really go anywhere. (pic 3)
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:46:18 
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:46:39 
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:47:17 no jay, that'd make the rear go up at a stop.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:47:35 and besides it wouldn't be able to stop very good and wouldn't stop if i let go of everything
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:48:03 ballasts' dont work, it just makes it heavier on the arms and suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:51:06 does anyone know what's up with my hover-chassis? because this is confusing me, and I dont think it's something to do with my build if anything.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:51:47 read above
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:53:31 Won't be online for a couple minutes, going to the neighbors to get my brakes bled.
