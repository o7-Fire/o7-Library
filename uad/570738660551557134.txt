plane-crazy 2022-06-19 02:22:54 i put pontoons on the sides of my ships
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 02:23:42 u can have the bottom part of the hull flat like a cardboard box
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 02:23:48 and i think that works
bot-central 2022-06-27 17:47:36 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 17:48:43 i built uss enterprise and my hangars were 7x7
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 17:49:17 i just used RC aircraft on it so they were pretty small
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 17:50:22 next ship u should build is uss cavalla
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 17:57:10 lol
bot-central 2022-06-27 18:02:33 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:07:54 is there a way to add a yellow stripe on the tail thats flush with the wing panel things like this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:08:26 dang
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:08:50 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:54:45 is there any way to make this not censor other than putting an m at the end?
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:55:40 yeah, but like how do i make it not censor
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:57:18 is there another way to make things not censor or is this the only way
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 18:58:04 so if its still censored then what
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:25:08 rate my plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:27:46 what is wrong with my plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:29:08 not enough?
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:29:14 
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:31:34 well it was this
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 20:32:02 u may need eye protection to even look at this horendus monstrosity
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 02:29:00 y does "j" get tagged when i have the same thing on the other side and its not tagged?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 02:36:53 when my plane is slow its tail heavy but when i speed up its nose heavy, how to fix
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 02:59:39 the "o" is still visible
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 03:00:00 but i just put a space in between the j and the o and it worked
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 03:00:01 thx
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 19:55:09 yay
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 19:56:56 so my plane is tail heavy when its going slow but when its fast its nose heavy
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 19:56:58 how to fix
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:29:09 my plane is tail heavy when im going slow but then when i go fast its nose heavy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:29:12 how do i fix this
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:35:39 pick another image
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:35:43 thats what i would do
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:12:23 its tail heavy when its going slow and nose heavy when its going fast, how do i fix this?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:14:33 yeah but when i speed up it becomes nose heavy for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:15:27 k
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:16:07 y not just wing pannels?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:17:28 because.
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:18:49 cuz it looks better that way
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:19:28 they arent
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:20:56 then that would be excess, useless weight
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:25:02 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:26:46 nope made it worse
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:27:21 in the front or the back?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:28:03 then the nose will be heavier when im going faster
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:28:30 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:31:14 do i make it apply at the center or not?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:31:27 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:56:16 can anyone tell me whats wrong with my plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 19:16:30 how did u know
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:27:59 i dont think i have enought motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:33:30 what can i improve upon
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:35:23 51*
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:36:35 
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:39:58 this better?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:41:04 alr
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 01:09:06 i zoom out
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 01:09:23 i dont use first person
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 01:09:40 well sometimes i do but on my p51 i cant really see anything
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:36:11 is this thicc enough?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:41:14 its really simple
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:44:07 yeah its extremely simple really
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:45:38 r u saying like instead of the front propeller?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:47:02 that would just make it ugly, especially since the biggest regular propeller is too small
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:47:17 and if i wanted extra speed i could just motor lock more rocket engines in
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:49:00 a what?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:52:51 oh u need it more thicc?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 02:53:25 lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:48:53 i added more motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:49:05 but i need more
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:50:05 :(
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:50:27 yall r hurting my feelwings :(
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:54:50 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 20:55:46 heavily motor locked plane
