The Tale of ryz_vik (498339462947012608)
help 2021-09-01 07:22:48 Uhh, I have some problems with conveyor drives, it works fine but after sometime (I exhausted it or overused it) it usually flings me into the Shadow Zone as I like to call it, do anybody have a fix for this?
help 2021-09-01 07:23:41 it usually only appears in my smaller builds using it, though.
help 2021-09-01 07:30:23 oh well
help 2021-09-01 07:30:33 its time to spam alot of hoverdrives instead
help 2021-09-01 08:07:57 looks pog for me
help 2021-09-01 08:09:21 I need something to cover the motorhole under the front part of the cockpit, do you have any ideas?
help 2021-09-01 08:11:31 i mean, I do have motorlock but its already full, so i guess its just the disconnector or i live with it

bot-central 2021-09-01 11:22:40 aw
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:23:28 i might be able to
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:23:41 lemme find one rq-
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:23:44 well that was fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:24:07 you mean MFDs?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:24:28 yea no sorry flying a plane in dcs made me like that :(
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:24:55 isnt that like
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 11:25:07 the UFCD on F16s or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:13:33 i think you need to put the "lift indicator" (the blue thing) near or on the mass indicator (the yellow one)
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:13:50 by adding more wing panels to the front or back or just ballast
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:15:42 what engine are you using?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:15:44 conveyor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:15:50 wait no it must be hover
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:15:58 cus its too small for conveyor right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:17:09 I have the same problems with my F16CM, but it doesn't really matter because i wouldn't be dogfighting at 1.4k anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:19:29 can be but i find it hard to make and very glitchy
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:19:40 so i just slapped hovers instead
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:20:15 im having the same problem lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:23:25 oh my
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:25:00 kind of the same happened to my F15c
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:25:17 couldn't go faster than 1.2k or it will rudder left hard and then gets sent into the shadow zone
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:29:38 afterburner effects?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:29:49 i have it on my F16C, i'mma get a video tutorial for it rq
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:30:05 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhfpti8Eus&t=20s
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:30:11 huh
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:30:35 maybe try lowering the length alot
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:30:36 like
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:30:42 0.005 if you can ive not tried
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:31:00 they can do both
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:31:19 no you cant
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:31:43 it'll basically infuse blocks but if you want blocks to stand out you'll need something to hold it
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:31:53 i usually use cameras or normal blocks, maybe trails
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:32:23 still can't post pictures
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:32:24 sadge
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:33:15 its fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:34:19 some people gotta learn something sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:34:26 **now thats alot of some in one sentence**
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:35:01 my planes are literally a motorlock tower with blocks strapped onto it
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:35:10 only if i can upload pictures :(
bot-central 2021-09-01 14:48:05 !rank
bot-central 2021-09-01 14:48:10 atleast im level 2 now
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:51:36 i mean shredders aren't fine but most of the time i can just speed away?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:53:23 i just finished my F16CM yesterday and im just sitting here like : what do i do next
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:54:11 yes okay i do wack now
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:56:04 large delta wing also makes good area for mounting rockets i guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:56:40 0,00010 because i've not built a "big" plane that looks like that ever
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:56:47 max points lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:57:02 personally thats big
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:57:26 my F16CM is like 1 blocks wide lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:58:06 hey, atleast the camo's good
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:59:47 hm yes **Stabbin**

bot-central 2021-09-02 12:03:46 **yes**
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:12:24 Hey uh, could I use Hoverdrives for normal forward propulsion in the Aeronautical ranking or no? I'm just asking
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:34 ooo okay
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:55 i just use hover thrusters just to get no sounds lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:00 super rockets too loud
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:08 but anyways i need to use it now
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:21 **which is pretty sad**
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:32 i only use hoverdrives
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:45 because about 90% of the time all my planes are small
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:46 like
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:15:01 the fuselage is never wider than 3 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:15:29 so i guess the only way out is to motorlock up a massive amount of rockets or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:17:01 this is about the best plane i've made so far
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:17:40 it still has some problems to it but i guess im just going to get better
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:18:08 not sure if im wrong but imo it looks like a mirage 2000C
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:19:03 is delta wing just cursed in PC
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:19:16 i've never built any delta wing planes that can compete with any of my "normal" planes whatsoever
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:20:24 hmm, maybe my normal planes just turns really fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:20:41 so i guess thats a myth lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:27:53 IRL, yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:28:00 i love delta winged planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:28:32 but maybe normal planes in plane crazy makes no sense and just pulls 90G whenever they want
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:28:53 and thats what delta wings in plane crazy can't really do, especially at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:29:11 but IRL to me they're very good performing
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:30:34 i'm gonna give them another chance with a gripen

general 2021-12-21 01:04:25 WT does not even get "simulator" right
general 2021-12-21 01:04:42 decent
general 2021-12-21 01:04:53 the handle looks a bit weird though
general 2021-12-21 01:05:23 yeah they give other planes something to do
general 2021-12-21 01:05:47 the fact that it calls itself "simulator battles" is still weird to me though lol
general 2021-12-21 01:06:45 anyways have this picture of an F15C flying over some weird waters and waiting for somebody to spawn in
general 2021-12-21 01:06:52 I have both VR and HOTAS
general 2021-12-21 01:07:02 **its not fun to play WT on VR I'll give you that**
general 2021-12-21 01:07:15 the views are so messed up
general 2021-12-21 01:07:22 cockpits are cramped as frick
general 2021-12-21 01:07:34 **and HOTAS does not work**
general 2021-12-21 01:08:02 i'd rather go get a free trial from DCS because quality
general 2021-12-21 01:09:52 its called overkill
general 2021-12-21 01:10:01 i play DCS with 15 buttons
general 2021-12-21 01:10:05 on my HOTAS

help 2022-03-05 14:09:44 try setting dampening up and stiffness up
help 2022-03-05 14:09:48 don't put too much of it though
help 2022-03-05 14:09:53 otherwise you'll bounce
help 2022-03-05 14:10:12 i'm more a mini jet builder so I don't really have any fields in this but I hope that it could help
help 2022-03-05 14:10:29 try setting your plane's suspension
help 2022-03-05 14:10:34 add more dampening and stiffness i guess
help 2022-03-05 14:10:41 oh and ropes
help 2022-03-05 14:10:54 put them next to the suspension so they don't go bouncing all over the place
help 2022-03-05 14:11:07 yeah thats good
help 2022-03-05 14:11:21 add some more stiffness to your suspension with the function tool
help 2022-03-05 14:11:49 i still need ideas <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
help 2022-03-05 14:15:51 hmm
help 2022-03-05 14:16:12 did you try putting the free length up?
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:26:02 Just 2-3 things that I have to say:
-The wing is kind of oversized
-The elevator is a legit triangle??
and maybe the pointy nose but depends on how you look at it
overall great though
<@!598480813050560512>
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:29:27 what happens if I post an su30 without intakes in <#384025409945337856>

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:30:07 + im too lazy to get rank because all my planes are pvp
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:30:16 and no hover engines = no life
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:30:41 well i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:30:49 i could probably live without hover engines but
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:30:56 rocket engines are just earrape lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:31:24 yeah

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:31:53 i just get the blue screen of death after running DCS and blade and sorcery at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:03 shouldn't have tried running both at once
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:29 2 games
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:29 yeah i ran dcs and b&s
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:34 but yeah my cpu committed suicide
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:39 i5 gen 9
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:43 not really
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:32:58 yeah

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:33:10 i have a gen 9 and never replaced it lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:33:19 its mostly the ram that sthe problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:33:23 16gb isn't enough

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:06 digital combat simulator
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:11 plane simulator
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:17 microsoft flight sim but combat
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:27 my hotas just shat on me
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:33 and my oculus link cable as well
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:54 never used it for dc
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:34:55 dcs

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:35:12 give ideas
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:35:17 i have vtol vr
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:35:19 its just that
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:35:27 link cable committed suicide
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:35:40 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:36:26 i never even tried to run vr in roblox
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:37:08 so i have no idea how to fix that
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:37:15 + i never used virtual desktop
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:37:46 should i remake an f15 for the 5th time
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:38:05 last time it went 3k and did 90 degree AOA everytime i tap S
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:38:33 can't aim wit hthat so i moved onto my su30 without intakes <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:40:19 have you tried removing some front wing panels or making the front lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:40:22 or vice versa
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:40:43 my F15 also does that because i gave it a shit ton of wing panels infront for maximum AOA
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:41:08 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:41:22 sometimes you just can't aim with it
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:41:39 I say sometimes because I have been there
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:42:01 well guess what thats exactly why I moved on
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:42:13 I went mouse with my Su30
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:42:18 I used that
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:42:22 it was my main problem just until now
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:42:49 i don't know anymore
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:43:46 i have no idea what that means but from looking at your pfp I know you are cultured
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:44:28 sensitive controls are great until it's too sensitive and throws off everything
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:45:00 it doesn't work if you literally turn 90 degrees everytime you tap s
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:45:08 then snap back at mach 2
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:45:33 its fine, you did good
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:46:20 my f15 flies 3000 but when i tap something they just have a seizure and die
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:46:33 agreed monsoon 🗿
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:47:07 my su30 doesn't wobble and i have a good time with it unlike my f15 which was only good at 300 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:47:39 thats why
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:48:17 agreed with smiley here
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:48:47 mouse planes can't outmaneuver a kb plane at slow speeds especially if those guys have those "aoa enhancements"
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:49:09 isn't that a cluster bomb
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:49:40 isn't it still classified as a cluster bomb because it clusters out?
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:49:53 or am i viewing this picture wrong
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:50:09 school me

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:51:28 <@456226577798135808>  do you have any ideas mr monsoon
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:51:34 NOT THE ORANGE
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:52:48 w
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:52:58 you can now commit war crimes with greater efficiency
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:55:42 when the
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 14:57:49 stability
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:00:20 is it normal for my helicopter to be that stable
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:00:28 i don't think it feels natural
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:01:02 design is pretty bad but the stability is just kind of satisfying
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:02:02 hax
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:02:25 or magic codes
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:03:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:03:16 was thinking of that too
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:03:39 until it finds something in its cone and starts chasing it
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:03 basically a better rocket
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:18 a better rocket
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:35 tracks at 2-3 plots distance and instantly atomizes your plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:39 basically a better pvp rocket
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:04:50 now thats the problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:05:07 well it'll be useful for taking shots that the enemy doesn't expet
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:05:09 expect
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:05:18 could be true
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:07:15 auto hotkey was allowed so if he was a smartass he could probably do it?
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:07:21 dunno though
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:07:44 a program that runs a script on your pc
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:07:49 i use it for depth charges
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:07:55 it doens't inject it
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:08:01 yeah it only does the sequence on your pc
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:08:24 as i told you I do not know
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:08:40 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:08:47 it is alien tech to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:10:29 what would cause it to rotate though
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:11:49 motor to create uh
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:11:52 how is it written again
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:11:58 torque
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:11:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:05 motor to create torque to roll
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:30 like how a helicopter needs the counter-rotation rotor to cancel the torque of the main rotor
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:36 but this torque is needed for the missile to tern
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:41 turn
