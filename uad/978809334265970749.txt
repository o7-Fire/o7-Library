creations-chat 2022-08-20 17:03:38 i mean i thought it was alright
creations-chat 2022-08-20 17:07:00 yeah i suppose that that city was on the lower end of things, but there isn't much good shit in creations today, so i might as well lower my standards for a little. and honesty, even thought it isn't the best, i still think it's alright
creations-chat 2022-08-20 17:10:12 yeah that makes sense

creations-chat 2022-08-20 19:41:54 Was thinking of uploading My 262 to creations, any advice i could get?
creations-chat 2022-08-20 19:45:13 anything else?
creations-chat 2022-08-20 19:53:44 ignore that
creations-chat 2022-08-20 19:58:23 as in the numbers?
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:03:01 ok so that idea was a bad one
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:06:31 Gray: 99,99,99
Brownish Gray: 88, 88, 77
Green (nose): 75, 140, 75
And the white is just the standard white colour
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:09:49 I've decided to re-do my building style completely, and i'm building an f-16c right now. I have the nose somewhat built, but that's it
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:13:41 i don't know exactly how to make the canopy look better without a shit ton of motorlocking, i couldn't fit the 1x3 without the motorlock sticking out of the front. This is more of a prototype to a different building style than a build mewant to look good, but i thank you for your feedback.
help 2022-08-20 21:44:23 meh
creations-chat 2022-08-21 16:54:24 what's the problem with the paint? i thought it was ok
everyone's been saying that it was bad
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:04:18 no. I don't do tuts

<@456226577798135808> i got into contact with a guy who has a discord server with a lot of good liveries, i was just lazy and tired the day i made it, so the colour was a bit shit
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:07:47 right here is an F-16c i'm working on at the moment as well
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:12:54 I've gotten a few comments on the canopy lmao, idk how i want to fix it, i think i will fix it before i post it in creations. (i should get a control surface intake, thanks for help) and basically all of my motorlocking stems from the nose, and i don't have the time or energy to move it back. thanks for feedback though
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:17:06 yeah, i might add a camo for later when i decide to upload to creations. also here are pics of it in the air.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:21:09 well shit.... you're right, but personally i think the 1x2 looks better. this is probably something i'll solve when pc2 comes out
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:23:52 maybe, i'll see what tickles my fancy. that is a plausible fix to my situation
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:26:50 i honestly just don't care
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:29:33 ah, the plane crazy community. about as bad as the war thunder one

creations-chat 2022-09-03 15:30:29 exactly
creations-chat 2022-09-03 15:33:49 <@918581321004089364>  yup, but i mean i can't get it past him, he does make those builds to be for twaddle who don't know how to motorlock, he's actually a pretty good builder otherwise.
creations-chat 2022-09-03 15:58:20 probs not impressive, but i found the first actual creation posted in <#384025409945337856> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/385563875929751564
creations-chat 2022-09-03 16:10:13 lmao, ik that the first post was that, but i meant the first i guess "casual" creation, if that makes any sense.

creations-chat 2022-09-10 03:14:08 as i meant to say, the wingtips have missiles on them, but they're a tut bc i'm stupid, so i ditched them for the photo
creations-chat 2022-09-10 03:19:51 it's alright, it was my first take at trying some different types of locking

<@821642310491570196>  üò≠
creations-chat 2022-09-10 03:23:33 at the end of the day. at least it's not a namnam tut
