The Tale of okiron. (750846285627785237)
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:40 so
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:40 uh
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:46 if i use conveyors on my tankj
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:53 it instantly starts lagging the entire game like crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:57 what the hell
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:05 well
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:08 i dont have much of a choice
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:18 might just switch it to ice and have like 4 conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:19 nah
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:22 threads ugly as hell
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:47 i did a "ratte but practical" design, so the tracks are covered.
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:02 ice and conveyor drive seems cool
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:03 but
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:08 i dont wanna brake all the time
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:19 since the tank weighs like 100 tons
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:32 hm
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:42 i think ill just remove like 90% of the conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:34:49 and keep like 8
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:35:09 since tank is lorge
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:35:19 dangit
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:35:19 hhh why cant u post media here
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:35:21 sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:36:01 maybe my role?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:36:02 prob
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:37:34 ye
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:15 no, i just need anything as a replacement
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:27 cause the entire 3 width tracks are conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:32 lags out if i use em
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:37 down to like 2 fps
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:43 and i have an RTX 3070
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:50 and I5-10600K kek
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:38:57 rolblox cant handle my drip
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:02 ik
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:06 but thats not the issue
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:16 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:18 it hasnt been
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:23 eber lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:25 ever*
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:38 the tank is too fat and slow to glitch
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:50 nein, didnt have the issue intil i finished the tracks
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:01:41 yeees
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:01:47 and my entire thing is covered with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:01:50 all 2k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:01:51 mmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:13:50 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:13:52 so uh
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:13:58 i put a conveyor engine in the tank
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:14:10 and it can now accelerate to 9000 units of speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:14:16 at 2k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 02:29:17 ***GAS, GAS, GAS!***

general 2021-05-25 14:29:14 t-50 is the best tank
general 2021-05-25 14:29:30 light tank, angled armor, with low ammo?
general 2021-05-25 14:29:41 mm
general 2021-05-25 14:29:46 i took out leopards with it
general 2021-05-25 14:29:55 Doesnt matter
general 2021-05-25 14:29:59 the tank rotates so fast anyways
general 2021-05-25 14:30:05 can drive like 70
general 2021-05-25 14:30:48 i dont play adracde
general 2021-05-25 14:31:53 wat
general 2021-05-25 14:31:58 get out?
general 2021-05-25 14:32:02 its two buttons my dude
general 2021-05-25 14:32:17 so was i
general 2021-05-25 14:32:30 but then i figured out a Hurricane MK1
general 2021-05-25 14:32:36 can take out jet planes
general 2021-05-25 14:32:38 easily
general 2021-05-25 14:32:48 seriously
general 2021-05-25 14:32:50 idc what yall say
general 2021-05-25 14:33:00 the hurricane mk1 is the best low tier plane
general 2021-05-25 14:33:04 even beats the yak and 109
general 2021-05-25 14:33:14 <a:insaneTroll:772660069376589825>
general 2021-05-25 14:33:40 stuka is CAS

general 2021-05-25 14:35:15 top kek
general 2021-05-25 14:35:36 but i like to go into custom battles with like 20 rounds of APCR in ym T-50
general 2021-05-25 14:35:47 and kill leopards by drifting behind them
general 2021-05-25 14:35:57 and firing 50 shells into their turret ring and engine
general 2021-05-25 14:36:02 despite having 20
general 2021-05-25 14:36:07 <:trollgod:826772768586203146>
general 2021-05-25 14:36:29 its fun
general 2021-05-25 14:36:35 cause u get to bully top tiers
general 2021-05-25 14:36:39 with funny fast tank
general 2021-05-25 14:37:03 i took out 3 migs jets with my Hurricane MK1
general 2021-05-25 14:37:22 Everytime they dove i got on their ass, fired at their tail, and watched them slam into the ground at mach 2
general 2021-05-25 14:37:45 ok

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:10:54 these ship designs are getting out of hand.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:39:34 OK this is pissing me off
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:39:43 i cant even make a godamn gate open
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:39:47 without being flung
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:39:49 seriously
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:39:56 I DONT KNOW
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:40:10 EVERYTHING IS
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:40:23 Literally just a motor, on a piston.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:40:37 The piston lifts it, and the motor swing it open, and then retracts again
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:40:44 on god bro

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:17 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:33 so how the hell am i supposed to lift the gate then
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:36 with gears?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:40 that'd be even more buggy
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:53 
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:50:56 since its built likke a box.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:51:18 in each corner it has three pistons, and a motor.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:51:46 And its literally the simplest part of my build and already the physics engine is shitting itself and crying
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:51:50 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:56:41 Elaborate..?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 16:59:52 OOOoo
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:12:59 turboprops are fun
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:13:56 ðŸ˜Ž
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:13:57 da
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:36:06 it actually bugs out
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:36:09 if i add more
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:36:22 <:Sadge:738720516566810684>
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:41:31 just keep an eye on center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:41:44 make sure your engines keep it steady
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:42:24 like so
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:42:38 how i made this fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:43:10 It wasnt made to be pretty
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:43:25 just to prove downward facing props were just as effective to my friend
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:43:55 
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:43:57 plus looks decent in flight
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:44:13 and the acceleration and braking is insane.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:44:35 godamn flak
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:45:42 i dont make many new builds anymore.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:45:52 the plot limitation is lame <:Sadge:738720516566810684>
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 17:45:59 but i understand why its there.
general 2021-07-02 20:38:01 
general 2021-07-02 20:38:01 lmao
general 2021-07-02 20:38:03 the fucking desc
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 07:50:14 daaamn thats hot
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:33 i have to ask
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:34 like
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:39 how the heck do motor 2's work
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:49 i know it has a hinge on the end.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:14:53 but does that mean this works?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:15:02 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:15:06 for tilt rotor aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:15:15 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:16:19 Pls anser <:Sadge:738720516566810684>
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:16:39 how do i adjust the servo then?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:16:44 and use the rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:17:20 adjust the angle, yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:18:04 So its only angled, and cant me moved mid flight?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:18:13 I was thinking of using it to tilt the rotor forward mid flight
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:18:23 to stabilize the center of lift
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:18:28 and not sway when flying forwards.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:19:37 like so
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:19:37 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:19:49 without tilting the aircraft forward
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:20:01 basically this
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:00 Wait, so the attachment point is the yellow stud
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:01 right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:10 yes no
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:11 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:14 AH
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:21:17 IC
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:24 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:26 I AM SO STUPID
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:28 ITS MOUSE AIMED?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:29 HAHAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:40 ic
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:40 AH
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:52 up
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:52 Ok, so just to clear it ip
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:55 what i want it to be
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:22:58 is a motor
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:23:02 that can also tilt the rotor forwards
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:23:08 while powering flight
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:23:27 Which means, i either need a counter rotating mechanism below it
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:23:30 then something tilting that
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:23:37 or i could use Motor 2, which i thought did that
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:26:25 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:26:25 like so
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:26:39 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:26:45 then using the servo to tilt the rotor forwards
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:10 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:12 like this diagram
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:27 Basically simulating pitch rods
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:33 NO
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:35 No*
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:43 its how a helicoper goes from stable hovering
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:27:47 to fast flight
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:28:22 Well
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:28:26 a kind of swashblade
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:28:40 well yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:28:42 kinda like that
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:28:47 but i dont need that extreme thrust
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:00 if i need that kind of lift, i'll use to motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:07 cause thrusters kinda uggo
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:11 and are unstable mid flight
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:34 yeah, ive seen em
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:35 theyre cool
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:36 just
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:39 not what im building
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:54 ish
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:29:55 Building a mix between a KA-50 and a kind.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:00 Hind*
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:07 So a troop transport capable gunship
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:11 But just winging it
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:18 cause i havent built a helicopter since 2019
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:22 and that one sucked
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:30 and couldnt even go forwards without swaying back to center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:30:54 and yeah its ugly but idc i wanna fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:29 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:29 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:31 I can fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:33 forwards
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:36 at a stable altitude
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:37 like thos
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:39 this
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:27:43 man this is amazing lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:29:28 quite small
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:29:36 nearly did it again
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:29:49 SO CLOSE
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:04:09 Hm, how do i stop my heli from tipping back and forth mid flight?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:05:32 .-.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:05:36 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:07:12 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:09:33 https://gyazo.com/e097867eda54f41ae9e9522e8c6f63c3
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:09:36 how do i stop this?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:10:18 The helicopter is fully centered
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:10:22 may that be the issue?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:11:03 Or is it not neccesary for a stable hover?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:11:53 Yeah..
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:12:01 Why would that solve it though=
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:12:02 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:03 How would i make this?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:06 ah
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:07 i see.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:15 I already had this
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:31 https://gyazo.com/7f4f2348b47b77a000e1e3cda042930e
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:46 No, there is nothing.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:13:53 It caused issues for lift due to drag
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:14:03 and pulled the tail back
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:14:12 causing the problem it supposedly fixed.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:14:21 Hover engines help
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:14:50 Yeah, but im fighting the drag caused when flying forwards, that causes the blades to pull back on the heli, and pitch upwards.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:16:15 loose hinge?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:16:17 or
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:16:20 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:16:36 I remember they used it on the X1
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:17:07 But i dont see it being useful unless its highspeed
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 22:17:46 hm, alright
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 00:05:49 yeah, got it to work
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 00:05:55 that was the solution
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 00:11:39 Issue is, the blades have to rotate slowly, due to the fact that the propeller blades have extremely much lift
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 00:12:46 But i guess unless you angle it with motors, its not gonna change
help 2022-02-08 12:41:41 So recently ive been messing around testing aesthetics, like a ring rotating around a warp craft.
help 2022-02-08 12:41:51 Not focused on building anything particularly detailed.
help 2022-02-08 12:42:01 Built a fun PVP ratte, but thats about it.
help 2022-02-08 12:42:27 Anyone know how people are able to mesh several "layers" of wings, and blocks at a certain position on their aircaft for details?
help 2022-02-08 12:42:33 Last one i built looked like this.
help 2022-02-08 12:43:00 While not horrible, its outdated and hasnt been updated since 2018
help 2022-02-08 12:43:18 It can turnfight, and keep up with modern jets, but only to a certain point.
general 2022-02-08 12:43:44 ayo can anyone gimme some help in <#478584971670454284> ?

help 2022-02-08 12:44:26 However, its hard when im limited to this.
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 12:51:15 Anyone think this would be a fun craft to build?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 12:51:27 Its from an old anime called Zipang
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 12:51:39 Its a destroyer attack craft/anti submarine craft.

help 2022-02-08 12:56:49 Ive hid a ceiling to the point i can't exactly build more details with normal blocks without getting painfully creative.
help 2022-02-08 12:57:00 It retains the idea.
help 2022-02-08 12:57:10 Its way smaller, and has more or less the same layout of weapons.
