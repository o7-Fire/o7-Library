plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:14:01 nice, could use some more decals
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:15:06 do the wings fold, coz if they did that would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:16:01 k
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:16:02 also i did instantly recognise the shape as an f-14 so i you did a pretty good job

general 2022-09-11 13:17:17 my yr 11 physics class actually used ksp for an assignment
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:17:34 those 3d models are sooo good
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:17:49 i like making halo ships and stuff, and it makes it so much easier
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:18:00 yea
general 2022-09-11 13:18:31 we got to play it in class (also do a depressing amount of writing)
creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:19:40 ye, the comments can be pretty harsh sometimes
bot-central 2022-09-11 13:20:11 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:20:46 i sometimes do that, but even then i like to base parts of it off of something else
bot-central 2022-09-11 13:21:07 im almost there

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:22:24 looks cool, even better if it is good in combat
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:23:13 cool vtol
creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:24:34 constructive criticism is good, but when its just trash-talking it kinda de-motivates people
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:28:27 most of the time its just people not understanding how roll and pitch work on vtols
bot-central 2022-09-11 13:28:35 so close

creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:28:52 ye
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:30:21 if ur really really really  bad, just use hover thrusters and pretend its VTOL
bot-central 2022-09-11 13:30:36 ye
bot-central 2022-09-11 13:30:47 i need lvl 3 for image perms
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:31:12 i literally said "if ur really really really bad"
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:31:57 using hover thrusters for any purpose other than exploiting them
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:32:10 honestly be quite easy
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:32:20 but handling would be trash
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:32:36 ikr
