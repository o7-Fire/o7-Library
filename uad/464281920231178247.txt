plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:29:39 Looks like the V
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:30:27 Force it to work with helium or adjust the rotor positioning
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:32:16 I dont usually say this but try using a showcase to get a general idea of what it should look like
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:32:25 Hell even 3d models work
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:33:04 try upscaling it a bit maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:33:09 Like 5-3 blocks wide?

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:33:44 What do you like to build usually
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:34:25 How about something from ace combat
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:34:28 Like an x-02
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:35:37 I tried to make an x-02 but I completely fucked up the intakes

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:43:24 By chance is it the sm variant
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:43:37 <:flushed:777333477183455273>
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:45:36 Do any of your guys’s save files randomly stop working
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:45:54 Like ur build wont load and it keeps saying “save failed” or some shit

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:29:21 Have the motors that adjust rotor pitch be locked
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:29:38 Not really for me
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:30:19 Looks good but i don’t really make robotic stuff so ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:30:51 Maybe you’re using stuff with a hella high block count and its just making u lag or somethin?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:36:35 Does it by chance have a fuck ton of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:36:48 Or glitch engines like hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:36:58 Oh hi faisl
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:40:15 Might be why then
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:40:25 Since my shit lags a lot when i use too many hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:40:34 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 23:41:03 Check performance stats then when in flight mode or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 00:11:39 Kc-10 extender
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 00:12:25 B5N then
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 22:51:36 Why tf do the blocks do this
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 22:56:00 Nah bruh, when that happens legit all the textures go from 4k to 180p
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 22:58:26 So much for using iOS..
bug-reports 2021-10-13 21:37:52 File “corrupts” and becomes unusable along with the build. Save and Undo stops working, along with build physics when in test mode. Thankfully this only happens to builds with 2k+ blocks. https://streamable.com/ce7ori
creations-chat 2021-10-13 22:42:58 Tower is supposed to be on the right side, not left
creations-chat 2021-10-13 22:45:01 ^
bug-reports 2021-10-13 23:22:18 Bruh there is, the tiny red button to the top right of ur save file
help 2021-11-03 17:59:18 Only happens with high block count builds from my experience
help 2021-11-03 17:59:33 Like 3-4k
help 2021-11-03 17:59:37 Ah
help 2021-11-03 18:00:03 What works for me is that i save in autosave, and then the save file
help 2021-11-03 18:00:25 And just keep doing it until the build is done
