creations-chat 2022-03-30 19:43:18 Any reason why for downvotes? What can I fix
creations-chat 2022-03-30 20:15:46 
creations-chat 2022-03-30 20:18:08 The turret is sorta blocky irl, and I have a custom angle for the front
creations-chat 2022-03-30 23:00:49 Thank you for the feedback, I really appreciate it, I‚Äôll do what I can when I have time.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:23:16 Lower your turret
creations-chat 2022-04-10 18:06:47 <@!450229047084187650> your aircraft carrier is great, mostly because of the size, however I would consider adding more detail, other than that, it‚Äôs awesome.
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:42:17 i have a question, why does my plane randomly seizure and lose all of its motor wings? And im not talking about the shaking from improper plane balance. It has a legitimate spasm in mid air, then goes back to normal, but then all of my motor control wings are gone, and  then after a minute they all boomerang back to my plane and then it will spasm again after a few seconds of flying.
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:43:08 what about them?
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:43:17 i have two to control my pitch
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:44:00 anyway to fix it?

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:47:16 is it new? i've never had this happen until about 3 weeks ago.
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:48:16 i can get one
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 01:00:50 i cant send in the video in the chat
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 01:00:56 but i have it now
contest-chat 2022-09-12 04:26:38 question, does the aircraft have to have been in service or can it be an xperimental aircraft that was built but never mass produced?
contest-chat 2022-09-13 06:51:40 im building a jet that was never put into service, but 9 prototypes were built and flown, and had designated armament, that won't get disqualified?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:07:51 So what exactly is the premise, is the aircraft only allowed to attack other aircraft?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:10:54 I want to build an He-280, it is an attack aircraft, or a ‚Äúfighter aircraft‚Äù. 9 prototypes were built and were flight tested and had armament. But it was never put into service, I was told build no serviced aircraft was fine, as long as it was built, are there now nerd rules?

contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:14:59 This is what this entire dilemma feels like, are there excess rules that were not posted? Or can I just build an aircraft that was real at some point and had a gun on it intended to shoot some bitches?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:57:42 That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:58:08 All these boofs are trying to make it complicated
