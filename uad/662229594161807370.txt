general 2022-12-29 12:43:59 Rickje is here
general 2022-12-29 12:44:07 Hi developer :)
general 2022-12-29 12:44:35 Just so you know I like the game
general 2022-12-29 12:45:05 Roblox is generally shitty
general 2022-12-29 12:45:12 But the game is very nice
general 2022-12-29 12:45:52 What does the slow motion do<:thchoink:527880803456122891>
general 2022-12-29 12:46:43 So basically if I slow it down that time stop flowing I basically created ‚Äúthe world‚Äù
general 2022-12-29 12:47:05 Stone ocean:
general 2022-12-29 12:49:31 Rickie weird question but can we have a circular bottom suspension instead of a square one to allow it to not stuck( which increase the size of work) in later updates?
Or do I just put it in <#507673335816126509>
general 2022-12-29 13:22:20 JJBA fans after rickie installed the slow motion mechanism:

general 2022-12-29 13:28:47 Sometimes I wonder if it is possible to add the pointer ( of gun‚Äôs direction) in plane crazy
general 2022-12-29 13:28:57 Usually not
general 2022-12-29 13:29:45 What did you do
general 2022-12-29 13:30:41 Sure

general 2022-12-30 00:07:46 That‚Äôs because we get burned into ashes üóø
general 2022-12-30 05:14:38 Cool, good luck
general 2022-12-30 05:19:26 Good luck on floor 3
general 2022-12-30 05:23:00 I just wonder
For plane crazy car builders, how do you make tires
general 2022-12-30 05:23:08 And rims
general 2022-12-30 05:23:37 ^if anyone has a 5x5 example I would be very happy
general 2022-12-30 05:25:01 I made a large pan car( a type of rc car) and another shaft driven car (in progress)
general 2022-12-30 05:41:10 *finally, something that I have contributed to!*
general 2022-12-30 05:48:21 Lol
general 2022-12-30 05:48:28 The builds look great
general 2022-12-30 05:50:11 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-30 05:50:20 I have gran turismo 5 and 6
general 2022-12-30 05:51:15 Oh yea I wonder how people think my ‚Äúpan car‚Äù looks in <#384025409945337856> I have simplified things a little bit but unsure how it looks overall
general 2022-12-30 05:52:53 Furries ( especially protogen) are usually engineer (or interested into being one)
general 2022-12-30 05:54:39 It spreads( kinda)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 05:55:38 Tell me what I need to improve
general 2022-12-30 05:56:36 Looks nice 
I wonder if it is possible to use a spinning motor instead of a large smoke pipe( if the smoke pipe is according to the reference size then don‚Äôt change it)
general 2022-12-30 05:57:27 Sleep
general 2022-12-30 05:57:55 Also tell me where to improve( <#384025409945337856> )
general 2022-12-30 05:59:02 Can‚Äôt really do that( most of the parts are essential) but I did a front redesign and posted it in <#504436696021204992>
general 2022-12-30 05:59:22 :|
general 2022-12-30 05:59:26 No.
general 2022-12-30 06:01:12 It‚Äôs called a chassis it doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to look nice
If I ever make a car shell on top then it cover the chassis and look nice
general 2022-12-30 06:01:59 Ok fine
general 2022-12-30 06:02:05 Give some time
general 2022-12-30 06:02:10 I will try
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:39:05 Thx (finally someone that knows rc)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:41:15 I would try , first thing to do is to add 4 support columns then making of a downforce shell( pan car shell)/ use your idea( better)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:46:11 Shaft driven rc ( in progress so far only rear is done)
It has camber tuning
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:52:33 Jeff Gordon‚Äôs ?
general 2022-12-30 06:53:50 <@878127726773538816> what is that in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:55:15 Alright Gordon‚Äôs it is
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:09:15 The angle:
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:13:10 Front camber and rear camber maximum:
(As told I can tune them independently)

general 2022-12-30 15:16:55 Kidnapping monkeys from Africa and sell at Cambodia in an attempt of evading tax paying
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:18:52 ^little note over camber can cause decreased handling and the overdoing the front will lift the tyres up that they can‚Äôt touch ground anymore
general 2022-12-30 15:25:02 False I got worse
general 2022-12-30 15:26:13 Mine :
2 rocket engines
2 bomb bay
A plane that can‚Äôt turn( and extremely off balance when threw a bomb)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:34:46 What‚Äôs with the ü§ì you can‚Äôt make a car with those function?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:36:53 Sure
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:49:30 Ikr it was pure accident
general 2022-12-30 15:56:14 ‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-12-30 16:00:38 Yes but I can make it awd( originally 4wd but I accidentally made drift angle and the front powered wheels disturb drift)
creations-chat 2022-12-31 02:11:01 More ridiculous angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 02:14:35 Muted

general 2022-12-31 13:25:59 Is that even possible
general 2022-12-31 13:27:55 BF series
general 2022-12-31 13:28:15 Nah bf109 and the variants
general 2022-12-31 16:20:30 Umm‚Ä¶
general 2022-12-31 16:20:49 What kind of Lunar calendar
general 2022-12-31 16:20:53 Are we talking here

general 2023-01-01 02:42:49 How about we wait for chess 2 first
general 2023-01-01 04:46:23 After calculation I found out my rc car has 27 stud wheelbase
According to meter it is 7.56m
Divide by 3 I get 2.52m which is Subaru 04 wrx sti's wheelbase
So I had made a 3:1 scale car
general 2023-01-01 04:47:01 So I am gonna make a Subaru

general 2023-01-01 04:55:32 How does it feel living in the past :)
general 2023-01-01 04:56:10 What's a bipedal car
general 2023-01-01 04:56:38 I am just joking I of course know timezones exist
general 2023-01-01 04:58:39 Anyhow does anyone know the dimensions of the building box
general 2023-01-01 05:00:35 Happy new year

general 2023-01-01 05:03:25 Nike 2022 car is crying in the corner
general 2023-01-01 05:07:04 I see, gyro included?
general 2023-01-01 05:07:42 Same except for me it was 13 hours ago
general 2023-01-01 05:09:22 Well if you are smart enough you know how Gyro works
You use a motor to spin a large mass flywheel horizontally and another one on the vertucal direction( to balance out angular momentum)
So that the car stays on vertically
general 2023-01-01 05:10:18 I am still remembering 2010
general 2023-01-01 05:10:47 Oh
