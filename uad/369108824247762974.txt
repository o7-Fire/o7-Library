plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:05:41 How do I report somebody for an Illegal build? It says report to somebody but they said don't report to them
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:06:13 So no way to get somebody apprehended?
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:07:02 Somebody built something very racist and violent
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:07:18 I have screenshots of evidence I could send in DMs
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:07:49 No
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:08:12 Ik
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:08:36 Should I ping them here?

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:11:01 although they're on DND
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 16:12:48 <@335599526414909451> I have a report to make, I know reports are closed but I think this is a very serious offence of the rules, would it be ok if I sent the evidence to you for further judgement?
