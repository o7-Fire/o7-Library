the-dump 2020-10-20 00:46:02 Theres legit a rank that says 8-12
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:46:04 as age
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:46:55 Did it get deleted?
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:47:02 Or did he just hide links
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:47:11 I really want to join
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:47:13 See something
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:47:35 I remember seeing a role that said "age" and someone had 8-12 on the role
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:47:47 I think

the-dump 2020-10-20 00:49:51 If you guys raid the server then pcc can be accounted for "promoting" it or not stopping it
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:50:07 Somewhere along the lines of that
the-dump 2020-10-20 00:50:36 So the mods and stuff will get in trouble because they didnt do anything about it or they let it happen

its the most common way to build it in the game
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:47:11 So if insignia is a ranking in the military, the iron cross wouldnt be an insignia right? isnt the iron cross just showing the German military in general
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:48:33 Since he said that the "insignia" looks off and that means ranking

creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:50:25 Indeed custom flaps, they are way better then normal default ones depending on how big you make them
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:51:25 Way smaller gaps and way less of them
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:54:23 Use ad to make it turn/ go left and right and q and e for up and down, those are the most common controls
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:57:11 I understand the dumb versions  but I dont remember pitch yaw roll and stuff I know roll would be the a s controls (for me)

creations-chat 2020-10-30 16:54:04 > inventor rank its for people that make their own tipe of vehicles right?
Not even close, the name is self explanatory, you have to invent something that hasnt been invented before in game like someone got inventor from making a minigun out of ropes
creations-chat 2020-10-30 16:55:05 <@!642151786966286348> It looks pretty good, the rotor looks a bit plain though and the back could be smoother

creations-chat 2020-10-30 16:58:19 > exactly, you got trash builds but III rank

creations-chat 2020-10-30 17:48:46 The turrets are unsymmetrical unlike alot of similar battle ships, ussr has some weird tastes in ships like the teal paint

any motor 2's being locked into another block?
motor 2's cant be inside eachother or they will fling your build
creations-chat 2021-04-15 05:41:30 That might be why, the fact they arent powered???
Oh I thought you meant they were just unpowered
from prior experiences its always a motor 2 or a powered but not locked motor
creations-chat 2021-04-15 05:45:59 So are you using motor 2's to angle the wing
just a yes or no answer since you said *servo*
Is it being locked into another block even though it looks like ti is
Just use a motor 1 for the angling, motor 2's are horrible for custom angle builds (besides for flaps)
np
Tldr dont use motor 2's for angle locking things

You do not need to engage in the argument, otherwise you risk being warned as well.

If you don't get a response from another staff member within a few minutes, feel free to DM me and I'll look into as soon as I get a chance (my response may not be immediate, but I always check and handle DMs and pings.))

plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:30:17 Literally just make a stopsign shape<:StopThat:559520667909881867>

the-dump 2021-10-01 18:31:46 instead or robux
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:35:35 This but fill the sides in
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:36:01 quick simple example
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:38:00 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:38:03 It should fit your build eitherway
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:38:18 I messed up the angle but oh well
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:40:59 Depends on the scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:41:04 And what it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:42:50 Yes do
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:31 For this most likely
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:44:06 You can make these out of trails
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:44:42 You said detail
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:45:03 Anything is possible without detail
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:46:19 It should be easy if its just a ball with arms
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:46:20 and legs
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:46:25 just not the livery
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:47:42 just use a preset bunch of wedges and experiment on size
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:47:53 And use triangle wedges/blocks like they're intended
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:52:42 Can you get a zoomed in image
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:53:50 yeah just do cylinders with a jet engine at the end
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:54:15 But the angled bit needs motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:54:37 since it goes out and up/down
creations-chat 2021-10-01 19:01:09 Spend 2 hours watching motorlocking tutorials

creations-chat 2021-11-06 00:49:09 Shitty image, still salty over downvotes huh <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-11-06 01:44:20 Not even mass downvoting you smooth brain
Theres just a lot of builds that arent the best <:bonehead:852239611753398323>
You don't even take into account the date of which they were posted you sped
creations-chat 2021-11-06 01:56:30 -Picture with the motorlock expired
-If you were competent enough you would look for things I upvoted
-I didnt get a single rank off of that build
-Stop being a moron
Literally 0 exposed motorlock besides for the bottom, which you can't even see anyways. Also if I didn't use motorlock then how did I stack the gold bars (containers) like that without very very exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:38:59 Going back to my point, you very much likely haven't even seen my latest builds, last one was 6 and a half months ago and if he wanted feedback I could give it to him

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:27:53 The front plate
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:27:56 It's stuck in my head
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:29:08 
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:29:23 It's so hard to make it not look like a face in pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:29:27 Dont know
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:29:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:30:28 I wanted to make a t-64 since every other t72+ tank is overbuilt but the front plate just looks stupid
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:31:51 I don't even know how realistic the 3d model I use is <:despair2:750289533354115184>
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:32:01 It's already missing the front most wheel
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:32:15 It's the only way I build
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:32:42 T-72 is simple but I don't like how commonly built it is
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:32:47 All of my friends so far have made one

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:44:05 The entire turret makes my eyes hurt
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:44:16 Atleast the MG is cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:44:36 I think someone made something like it
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:45:01 There was something good that looked like a merkava
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:45:08 Cant remember the exact builder

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:57:21 Not giant but quite large
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:57:36 Probably 2:1 by the looks of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 07:57:51 It looks so small though

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:12:28 I'm yet to see a good russian tank with era spam using gold blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:12:58 I wish we could make it a default material
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:13:20 Gold is almost useless
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:13:31 Besides for obvious stuff like banks 💀

It's as simple as it can get so far, ofc I will fix the barrel gaps
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:58:18 Pennies, I used all of my sparklers on deck details
<@!683847069890510887>
These https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751677102469939382/919392798174752799/unknown.png
Also the sparklers base explodey thing doesnt work anymore
creations-chat 2021-12-12 01:02:07 Also another reason, I need 20 of these across quite a lot folds <@!683847069890510887>
And there are 2k tipjars <:Troll:798869339180498994> 
Dcs are too thick and would provide too much exposed motorlock
Enough paint would probably cover over up
creations-chat 2021-12-12 02:06:13 They're way too small, but trails fit 50 cals better
Scale too small for much else
until rick gives a shit about the game and increases block amounts

creations-chat 2021-12-12 02:19:17 9 on each side symmetrically so that's 18 and +1 on the back-most turret
so around 4-5 blocks long for the barrel so that wouldn't be valid, and the deck detail I'm too lazy to make round motors for
creations-chat 2021-12-12 02:34:03 It's fine, thanks though
Will probably experiment later

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:46:41 M
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:47:40 Do normal pilot seats still control main builds
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:47:42 As normal
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:30 Ok good
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:38 Mouse controlled?
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:42 Cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:46 Which is why I needed the settings
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:52 Ok good
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:48:54 I use keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:49:20 It blows up the text signs
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:49:45 lol

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:50:52 What the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:50:54 ??????
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:03 Most people either use ws or shift cnrtl
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:05 control
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:47 I use stuff like [] and ;' for small details
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:53 Since they're out of the way
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:55 23 for main stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:51:58 or 45
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:52:01 rt
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:54:38 I use - for piston and = for anchor
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:54:41 p for trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 06:54:57 j
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 07:21:13 I wonder if a very detailed F-4 would get downvoted
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 07:21:30 Since stuff like F-18s F-15s and F-5s do
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 07:22:01 But people downvote for overbuilt factors some times
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 07:22:40 No just wondering

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:08:52 Its connected to the motor which is also connected to a solid block
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:09:13 It would stick out of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:09:49 
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:09:54 It barely fits
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:10:10 And theres a text sign on the back of said sign
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:10:17 Holding the trail and sign together
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:10:19 yet it just
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 21:10:25 disappears

plane-crazy 2023-07-08 07:03:56 what even causes it
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:09 text signs are completely broken ever since signs as a whole were "fixed"
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:16 I cant place two of them in a row
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:24 and they dont have hitboxes from behind
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:32 so you cant connect them or configure
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:37 
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:18:44 just completely ignores the text sign
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:19:03 goes infront but not the sides or back
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:19:17 
bug-reports 2023-07-09 00:22:56 honestly seems like those patches that were announced were completely useless or just not implemented
bug-reports 2023-07-09 03:26:18 I worded my statement poorly but I meant this bit
bug-reports 2023-07-09 03:26:30 I still have the same issues ive been having for months, which were allegedly improved upon above
bug-reports 2023-07-09 03:26:38 Once I interract with my pistons or motors my ping infinitely rises
bug-reports 2023-07-09 03:26:45 and I cannot close the game without using task manager
bug-reports 2023-07-09 19:13:24 The issue still persists but atleast the ping doesnt rise to the hundreds of thousands anymore
bug-reports 2023-07-09 19:20:57 I wonder if pistons and phyics anchor blocks just dont cooperate
bug-reports 2023-07-10 01:36:51 PIston lag spikes still arent fixed
bug-reports 2023-07-10 01:37:02 Motors reset even more now
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 01:45:23 does anyone have recommendations for a 1.75 wide canopy
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 01:47:31 I cannot go 2 wide as I am too commited to this design and would prefer to be accurate
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 01:49:35 I already have 30 pistons and my build is 250 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 01:49:51 I mean like block choice
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 01:50:09 its working fine ive just run out of ideas
