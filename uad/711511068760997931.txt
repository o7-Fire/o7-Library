The Tale of motorlocked (711511068760997931)
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:11:31 hey uh, i did the su 27s and can you tell me the issues? im gonna try to fix them
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:14:28 prob bc of the exposed locks, but it did get alot of likes compared to dislikes
creations-chat 2021-12-01 10:12:32 yooo thats one of the best f-35s i have seen
creations-chat 2021-12-01 10:23:11 i checked some replies of our su 27 pics in <#384025409945337856> and i noticed some people telling the issues, i would be glad if they said to me the issues of the su 27s that i can try to fix
creations-chat 2021-12-01 10:33:00 i cant link messages sadly, but just search su 27 blue spirits in the search bar and go a little down
creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:02:26 uh what?
creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:04:44 i cant send pics...
creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:07:07 How can i fix the stabilisers, cockpit is angled so its okay if it looks off
creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:09:43 Want to join PC and help me fix these issues?
creations-chat 2021-12-01 11:12:48 dark mode needed
creations-chat 2021-12-01 16:16:04 very nice
creations-chat 2021-12-01 23:31:22 wow it ended
creations-chat 2021-12-01 23:51:42 dont click it, its not real and steals account. we need an admin rn
creations-chat 2021-12-01 23:55:29 the discord thing you clicked isnt discord gift, its a slightly different variation in the link. hence, it sends you to an ip grabber *i think*
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 10:16:36 waterjet would be spammed to keep shredders away, but seriously, WATER?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 10:32:13 pc1 wu
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 10:59:38 fun fact: the best counter is making your build the flattest possible, a tnt platform is a shredder's nightmare

creations-chat 2021-12-21 16:26:43 the cockpit looks like a su 57s, not a f-22s. i recommend using 1x2 wedge and 1x2 half up wedge cockpit style or angled  cockpit
creations-chat 2021-12-21 16:29:09 plus whole intake is wrong, omg cheese grater wings, pls fix spine, fix engine
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:01:56 my advice is to the change the front wings a little
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:05:04 imo f-18 front wings are over used, im just saying, ok then keep it
creations-chat 2021-12-25 17:30:10 💀  real
help 2021-12-27 10:59:43 what do you want
help 2021-12-27 11:00:11 i didnt like your jet because of the cockpit, thats alll i dont like
help 2021-12-27 11:01:03 also because it looks fairly similar to a f-15
help 2021-12-27 11:01:24 ok
help 2021-12-27 11:06:27 i wasnt typing
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:23:04 we have all been tricked, the jets we all know and like are just COOKERS WITH WINGS AND BOMBS

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:04:53 i putted the 3 dots because it showed there were wayyyy more numbers.
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:05:03 but the speed bar didnt fit

creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:52:05 the magic of motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 13:35:22 <:nooo:787097964946259978> what is this
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 15:01:28 what are my eyes witnessing 💀
general 2022-02-11 18:36:24 4
general 2022-02-11 18:36:40 wait what
creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:50:59 what is that
creations-chat 2022-02-15 20:49:23 <:trollface:775024642104229898> heheheha
creations-chat 2022-02-15 20:55:18 **the easy way** 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:04:54 good planes require to have good amounts of effort to be treated with such. easy way is just another way of saying that you dont want to put as much effort to make it look good. for me, i try my best and go to the hardest way, any hard way to make it the best as i can. just saying.
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:07:09 🤣 well atleast you tried the wings
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:11:04 i never mentioned you betrayed me, but all of this because you said you wanted the easy way, not the hardest. the hardest way may not be perfect, and no ways are. but i just wanted to say that if you want something with good standards, then it should take good efforts.
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:37:40 insanity
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:38:41 where can i discuss the consequences of motor locking in PCC and its future on society?
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:40:20 true, i would recommend some random 4+ gen fighter no one cares about, smth like su 34
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:41:21 thats exactly why no one makes it, and why would it be kinda new for you to make it. but hey its hard.
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:45:25 alot of people tend to make low effort american jets like f-22, thats why it looks hard but you just need skill. like everything ingame.
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:48:14 😭 nuuuuuuuuuuu
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:48:32 aeureonicol enginer V
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:49:59 do u have any high quality jets btw
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:50:42 ok i leave xd
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:54:07 💀
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:56:35 i have jets which i can consider better, but im reserving to making a f-35 which will look the best. plus not ingame.
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:57:14 what the actual
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:57:20 what is that supposed to be
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:57:45 infact.
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:58:08 i do jets very slowly but my most recent jet was a terrible nose f-18
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 13:58:27 so my best jet right now is prob the su 33 or su 27
