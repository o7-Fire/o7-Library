plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:31:14 Anyone know how to fix my missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:31:26 When I shoot them in the air they dissapear
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:31:36 They kinda just evaporate when I press the key
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:31:43 I did that
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:32:30 Still dont work
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:39:00 I would be able to relate if my missiles worked
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:40:45 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 06:40:50 They havent worked for like a month
general 2022-11-08 23:30:02 bro this game is unplayable
general 2022-11-08 23:30:14 Im trying to test a plane I just made
general 2022-11-08 23:30:44 and like an hour ago I justt finished an entire su 57 and then it kicked me and didnt save it
general 2022-11-08 23:30:56 Non pvp is boring
general 2022-11-08 23:31:15 I dont build stuff to just fly it
general 2022-11-08 23:31:18 I build it to fight in it
general 2022-11-08 23:31:54 Ok its not boring but its not as fun as pvp
general 2022-11-08 23:32:17 you dont have to
general 2022-11-08 23:32:51 If im already in a pvp server and I wanna build something I dont switch gamemodes
general 2022-11-08 23:32:54 I justt build it
general 2022-11-08 23:33:10 I will
general 2022-11-08 23:33:22 But they still need to fix the damn game
general 2022-11-08 23:33:54 What do you do in casual besides build and fly
general 2022-11-08 23:34:19 pvp you can build fly and fight
general 2022-11-08 23:34:28 yes
general 2022-11-08 23:34:36 How
general 2022-11-08 23:34:51 They cant if its not loaded in while your building
general 2022-11-08 23:35:00 and if you mean while flying just fly faster
general 2022-11-08 23:35:20 I know what motorlock is I just dont use it
general 2022-11-08 23:35:33 I mean yeah im bad at building
general 2022-11-08 23:36:21 the only reason I wanna play pvp rn is cause I built a plane earlier and I wanna see how easy it is for people to destroy it
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:38:01 They needa fix this game
the-dump 2022-11-08 23:39:35 Pvp is unplayable at this point
general 2022-11-08 23:44:10 yeah

general 2022-11-08 23:54:13 anti air*
the-dump 2022-11-08 23:54:33 I never said it was his fau;t
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:54:53 yeah
general 2022-11-08 23:55:42 Someone in my server is pissed cause someone has a ball cannon thingy
general 2022-11-08 23:58:07 I just got told to eat some dudes ass for saying calm down
general 2022-11-08 23:58:31 Hell nah
general 2022-11-08 23:58:41 He was a shredder bug kid
general 2022-11-08 23:58:49 I would never
general 2022-11-08 23:58:55 Yeah
general 2022-11-08 23:58:58 he had an army of em too
general 2022-11-08 23:59:07 Tied together with cameras or something
general 2022-11-08 23:59:44 They have a hypbeast avatar
general 2022-11-09 00:00:14 i think imma be 6 feet under by the time pc2 comes ot
general 2022-11-09 00:00:35 I have a t54
general 2022-11-10 22:02:55 Yo does anybody know how to fix my missiles? Everytime I move at all and fire them they just dissapear off of the launcher thingys and dont fire
general 2022-11-10 22:03:52 They've also been doing it for more than a year now
general 2022-11-10 22:08:29 does anybody know how to fix my rockets/missiles? Everytime I fire them while moving they just dissapear and ive tried it with and without legacy on and it doesnt do anything.
general 2022-11-10 22:09:49 Nah ive asked people to tell me if they fire or not. The only way ive gotten them to fire is by anchoring my plane midair to stop it then firing them
general 2022-11-10 22:10:55 just the normal ones ingame
general 2022-11-10 22:11:28 its been happing for over a year
general 2022-11-10 22:12:10 they dont explode they literally just dissapear off the plane and respawn as if they worked like normal ones
general 2022-11-10 22:12:30 the only way I can is with guns and yk they suck
general 2022-11-10 22:12:58 literally just hit my bind and keep going straight. I mean ive tried firing upside down. Swerving away after firing them
general 2022-11-10 22:13:03 ive pretty much tried everything
general 2022-11-10 22:13:43 and it still does it with any plane I use no matter if its a tut or not
general 2022-11-10 22:13:48 so its not the plane
general 2022-11-10 22:16:20 got any other ideas
general 2022-11-10 22:19:17 I barely use motorlock but I always use more motor 2s then motors
general 2022-11-10 22:21:51 OH I THINK I KNOW WHATS HAPPENING TO MY ROCKETS
general 2022-11-10 22:22:30 Im on yt watching a video on bugs and someone put something called the rocket glitch in the comments. Its when you go over a certain speed and shoot rockets they teleport far behind you
general 2022-11-10 22:22:39 But idk if thats whats happening cause the comments a year old
general 2022-11-10 22:23:55 I just want my rockets to work. Its been doing this for like 2 years
general 2022-11-10 22:25:29 Ig I never thought of that cause wouldnt they be infront of you if they are getting thrown off the plane at the same speed as your plane and then being given additional thrust?
general 2022-11-10 22:25:37 or ig the plane has way more thrust
general 2022-11-10 22:26:15 But it happens no matter what speed I go at as long as im moving at all they just dissapear.
general 2022-11-10 22:26:26 that makes sense
general 2022-11-10 22:28:04 oh yeah the same thing happens to my fireworks too
general 2022-11-10 22:29:09 YES
general 2022-11-10 22:29:19 IO FINALLY FOUND A VID WHERE SOMEONE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM BRO
general 2022-11-10 22:29:33 AND THERES LIKE 400 COMMENTS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME BUG
general 2022-11-10 22:31:15 Imma go try my rockets on a different computer
general 2022-11-10 23:01:46 I figured out what the problem to my rockets was
general 2022-11-10 23:02:03 I went onto a diff computer and they worked fine so its probably a graphocs tjomg
general 2022-11-10 23:02:09 graphics things*
general 2022-11-12 07:36:58 dj sKL:A
general 2022-11-12 07:38:15 I made santas sled and its November
general 2022-11-12 07:38:42 I told shredder bugs they coukd choose a present and whatever they said I would drop a bomb on their head
general 2022-11-12 07:38:45 lemme guess
general 2022-11-12 07:38:47 asked
general 2022-11-12 07:39:04 an individual
general 2022-11-12 07:39:34 I mean look at my pfp
general 2022-11-12 07:39:36 Its def me
general 2022-11-12 07:39:45 Totally not some random dude I found on google
general 2022-11-12 07:40:13 eat my
general 2022-11-12 07:40:16 finish the sentence
general 2022-11-12 07:40:54 The word was cake
general 2022-11-12 07:41:05 Eat my cake. I made it for veterans day
general 2022-11-12 07:41:36 oh ok
general 2022-11-12 07:41:51 I wanna bomb shredder bugs
general 2022-11-12 07:42:13 I have an idea
general 2022-11-12 07:43:01 How about you make a c47 or any big bombing aircraft. and fill it with bombs. But the bombs are cutter bombs and you just drop them on any shredder bugs.
general 2022-11-12 07:45:18 Nah yknow how anytime they see something on the grouind they start molesting it
general 2022-11-12 07:45:22 just dropo them then
general 2022-11-12 07:45:42 and you could probably hit them out of the air if they werent super high up cause of the range on cutter bombs
general 2022-11-12 07:46:24 Damn that looks way nicer than anythinjg I could build
general 2022-11-12 07:48:59 Someone in my game hates santa clause
general 2022-11-12 07:49:02 and his reindeer
general 2022-11-12 07:49:21 I made his sleigh and they just bombed me and specifically went for the reindeer
