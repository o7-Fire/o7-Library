plane-crazy 2022-03-18 02:41:58 Is there any way to make a plane accelerate bit so fast (I am using jet and rocket engines for the speed)
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 02:42:49 Okay
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:25:56 I was told rocket and jet engines were bad, so what could I use to make my plane accelerate realistically and not super quickly
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:26:59 Alright I’ll test
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 07:27:17 Any criticisms (I don’t have image perms link is image hosting website) https://ibb.co/hRwnj6t

plane-crazy 2022-03-18 07:31:47 It’s not an ip grabber that’s why I said feel free to look up the website

plane-crazy 2022-03-18 07:40:23 Came back and saw that, it’s fine that you say that but do you have any constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 07:41:38 Fair point I haven’t played in a year but the picture was pretty bad
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 07:41:43 Good night for real
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 00:46:55 Can someone help me with this? So I’m working on my jet, and decided to add tilting windows to match the shape. I made it so you press a button to get them in the angle, and then press another to lock them into place. They are still, but when you accelerate they snap back into the original angle. Is there any way to lock them into place? Streamable cause no image perms https://streamable.com/7jmuu7
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 00:47:22 Okay
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 00:48:08 isn’t that for memes
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 00:49:25 can’t post image in the dump
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:49:49 Ant criticisms? It’s not based off any airplane. I was told to use pyramid for nose but I like half ball more
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:50:34 I know
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:50:47 Let me get a different angle

plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:55:45 I don’t know what color pallet to use
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:55:54 or what material
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:56:15 yeah I know
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:56:21 it’s made of separators
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:56:39 the walls
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:57:38 the walls are locked in there
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:57:44 I think replacing the floor and making the walls sand will fix it
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 02:58:17 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 03:07:13 I took your advice
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 03:07:36 it’s better but the floor is too dark
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 03:07:53 and I want to add lights and stuff to make it better
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 04:23:25 landing gear but I’m making custom ones right now
