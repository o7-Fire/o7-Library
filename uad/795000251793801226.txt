general 2021-10-31 09:21:24 Its been 18 hours without Roblox, I can’t stop shaking and I’m having severe withdrawals. I woke up today trying to log onto Roblox but the site was down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldn’t go to school today, and I can barely get out of my bed to do anything. I’m sick to my stomach at this point, life is worthless. Its been 20 hours now without Roblox. I can no longer take this torture. I'm unable to stop crying and shaking, i've had 10 mental breakdowns. I can't bear the torture of not being able to attend a patrol. I’m starting to Hallucinate I need my glowies again. Please roblox fix this. I have no more motivation to go on, my life is worthless. I cant take this anymore, Roblox has been down for 24 Hours, I am receiving extreme side affects of extreme withdrawals, extreme anxiety, depression and illness. 24 + hours without roblox… i'm having a mental break down right not and I cannot control myself.. I tried touching grass and almost fainted. I miss Roblox and I have been surviving this hellish place called “Survive without roblox” for almost 30 hours now, i'm about to be host grabbed in here. Put a note on my grave when roblox is online again….
