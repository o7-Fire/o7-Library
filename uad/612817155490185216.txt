plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:04:15 i dont hava video but the easiest way to make mechs is to make the shape first ballast blocks in the foot helium in the head and torso to keep it standing then add unpowered motors where the joints are then finally put propellers on the feet to make it go forward and that is the easiest way to make mechs

general 2022-07-22 04:26:50 does anybody know if the saves will port to pc2?
general 2022-07-22 04:27:03 saves from pc1
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:00:00 Does anybody know if saves will transfer over to PC2?
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:07:02 Thanks
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:08:42 Probably?
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:08:53 Nobody knows it was just an expected release date.
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:09:16 Knowing Roblox developers it will probably not be released for another month or twol
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:09:53 I personally think the top one looks better for a A320
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:10:17 Planned release date not actual
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 06:12:48 Alright

plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:57:33 What does anchor block physics do?
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:58:45 If your trying to fix it it's too fast and not enough wing and control panels
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:51:08 Does anybody have a good shape/frame for a pumpkin? I'm trying to build a giant spider pumpkin for halloween but I keep ending up with a oval, and when I say giant I mean like 20 blocks big
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:51:53 I know but it looks just like an oval and not like an actual pumpkin
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:52:12 It's like you stuffed a pumpkin full of cotton and then let it rot
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:52:20 I've tried
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:52:47 Well it is hard for me in specific, which is why I'm here
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:54:19 No I mean like the verticle shape
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:54:47 Alright
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 18:54:50 I'll try that
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 19:05:55 Yeah it didnt work
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 19:06:18 I would also give you ideas but I dont know what those are
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 19:08:47 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 19:08:59 Like battleships in the navy?
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 19:09:24 Oh

general 2022-09-30 19:26:37 no
general 2022-09-30 19:26:39 it cant be
general 2022-09-30 19:27:37 this is some fucked up shit
general 2022-09-30 19:32:20 no
general 2022-09-30 19:32:32 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:56:27 Does anybody have a basic pumpkin outline that I could use for a giant spider pumpkin build for halloween?
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:01:30 yeah that makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:01:46 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:05:46 despite what your instructions have told me to do it appears as if that did not help
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:07:51 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:07:53 like a frame
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 22:07:58 for a pumpkin

plane-crazy 2023-03-29 03:17:11 does anybody know if pc2 will have improsed water physics?
general 2023-05-23 04:42:17 im starting to assume pc2 is never gonna come out at this point, what about you guys
general 2023-05-23 04:42:47 oh
general 2023-05-23 04:43:33 so
general 2023-05-23 04:43:33 wait
general 2023-05-23 04:43:38 is pc2 gonna come out or not
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:21:35 hey, when do you guys think pc2 might come out? out of curiosity.
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:32:47 yeah and presumably saves will carry over to plane crazy 2!
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:33:17 obviously
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:33:27 but atleast playing pc1 is still worth something
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:33:41 like
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:33:42 pppp
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:33:45 pppllane crazyy!?!??!?
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:34:33 gliding is something but it could use a seperate script or something to make it possible
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 03:34:37 maybe it could be toggleable
