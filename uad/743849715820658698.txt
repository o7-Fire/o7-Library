plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:53:12 Greetings everyone, I made something in the game that I kinda want to share
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:53:32 I mean like a build in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:57:36 I can't post images for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:58:14 okay
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:58:20 nvm then
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 04:01:36 okay ya'll can stop pinging now
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 04:02:00 I glanced over that in the info cause I'm a moron, I won't leave tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 04:03:11 I said you can stop pinging now
general 2021-11-26 08:46:01 Speen
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 08:46:29 Who wants me to DM them my custom Plane Crazy Engine?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 08:47:05 Aka the description and what it is
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 08:48:08 I agree
general 2021-12-18 18:24:23 nyoooooom
general 2021-12-21 03:43:52 SwawS
general 2023-01-30 03:30:02 I have made a flight pod
general 2023-01-30 03:30:09 And it is semi controllable
general 2023-01-30 03:30:10 :D
general 2023-01-30 03:30:28 Ain't stable but it can fly for a bit
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 04:03:24 I've been trying to make one of those flying drones(dm for how it looks rn)
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 04:03:30 Any help on stopping the wobble?
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 04:04:58 Also to help with control
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:10:00 I just use this game to make random stuff
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:10:06 Or roleplay obama
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:24:25 Like the much more preferable(in my opinion) hover engine.

A hover thruster(s) tries to hover away from a motor. Which is connected to the same ship.

Infinite thrust
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:24:43 I prefer hover thrusters because you can throttle the output instead of only on and off
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:36:09 No like, using left shift and left ctrl, you can increase or decrease the strength of hover thrusters mid flight
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 06:37:05 So while it may not be as fast, it is predictable and you can control it more easily
general 2023-02-03 01:21:53 How to we report people?
general 2023-02-03 01:22:25 Because someone made an "inappropriate" image using the building system
general 2023-02-03 01:24:45 Bruh
general 2023-02-03 01:25:47 Sorry about the random ping, discord doing weird stuff
general 2023-02-03 01:26:00 Just warning people because people are weird
