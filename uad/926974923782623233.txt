general 2023-04-30 03:00:54 get the flak 18 out and mount it on a truck
general 2023-04-30 03:01:00 1 minute delivery
general 2023-04-30 03:01:20 but the package may not be intact
general 2023-04-30 03:02:10 right
general 2023-04-30 03:03:03 how about we rip one of the guns off of the bismark and use it
general 2023-04-30 03:03:15 because its large enough that it can fire multiple packages
general 2023-04-30 03:03:49 wont that just vaporise the package?
general 2023-04-30 03:04:12 we cant use any orbital weapons because the milk will vaporise on re entry
general 2023-04-30 03:04:18 but people need the milk
general 2023-04-30 03:04:40 replace all the oxygen with co2
general 2023-04-30 03:05:06 great lets go get a pattent
general 2023-04-30 03:05:16 i dont see any flaws in this plan
general 2023-04-30 03:05:41 do you see any flaws?
general 2023-04-30 03:06:30 now we just need to figure out how to speed up the process of replacing all the oxygen
general 2023-04-30 03:06:32 wait
general 2023-04-30 03:06:46 co2 will have just as much air resistance
general 2023-04-30 03:06:59 so it doesnt solve the issue
general 2023-04-30 03:09:00 what if we made a atnsphere like  HD 189733b (yes thats a plannet) and make it rail glass sideways so we can just attack the milk to the glass so to glass will take the milk to the customer
general 2023-04-30 03:09:28 oh shit
general 2023-04-30 03:10:54 well i mean china does make 18.6% of our economy so if the asains turn against us we ded
general 2023-04-30 03:12:16 wanna go make a giant milk orbital strike cannon in plane crazy?
general 2023-04-30 03:13:57 correct
general 2023-04-30 03:16:34 ive seen some people say india isnt in asia but i guess thats kinda for the same reason as the middle east, they have a completely different accest and look way different
general 2023-04-30 03:18:19 closest that russia ever came to launching nukes was the cold war
general 2023-04-30 03:19:07 and russia probably wont use nukes in ukraine because if any country at all alunches a nuke u have basicaly the whole world against you all the sudden
general 2023-04-30 03:21:36 how did we go from having some of the best generals in hisotry as presednets to a sleepy old man who jumpstarted inflation
general 2023-04-30 03:29:19 i live in colorado, the mile high state in multiple ways, the first state to legalise multiple types of drugs and the highest state in altitude.
