creations-chat 2022-10-09 03:44:03 I need embed
creations-chat 2022-10-09 14:56:22 I should make a single block creation, and give it an excellent sales pitch
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:05:35 Excellent work with the mizzan, hull, and jibsail. You could add those triangular sails between masts that large ships have. (I dunno the name of them) Reply: yea
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:08:40 Also, you could make the middle mast taller and add an additional slightly smaller square rig. IMO that would make it look cooler
