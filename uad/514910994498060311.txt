general 2020-09-08 21:48:09 i tried doing an inverted controls flight, cuz control glitched, so, i took off, and everything went down hill from the climb
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:04:22 &suggest Flap Track Fairings, or the pods under wings, just make some basic ones, or something nice, doesnt need to be in a control surface, probably a wing panel 1x1 or 1 wide 2 long, and a basic pod under it, and make large, medium, and small, this adds realism, dont animate them, we can use them in custom flaps much better than making our own, they would fit in a 1 wide spot on the grid, add strobe lights, with custom pulse setting, like 3 flashes ever second or 2, they would flash on their own, flap track fairings should look kinda like this (white part).
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:05:24 oof
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:05:35 i cant suggest cuz im a loser, but you get it
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:05:49 no. losers dont read
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:06:16 ok, tbh, the flap track fairing on the 737 looks too big compared to the winglet
