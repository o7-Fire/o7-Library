general 2022-07-07 21:26:33 Oil, gas, plastics, steel, grain
general 2022-07-07 21:26:39 Pretty much anything
general 2022-07-07 21:27:08 We have enough infrastructure in place to drill our own oil thoâ€¦
general 2022-07-07 21:28:26 We shouldnâ€™t
general 2022-07-07 21:28:30 Never said we should
general 2022-07-07 21:29:18 Maybe not take in the imports of oil and gas
general 2022-07-07 21:29:32 But everything else we need and canâ€™t make ourselves pretty much
general 2022-07-07 21:30:22 We can drill our own and make our own gas, plus we can import from Saudi Arabia and other countries
general 2022-07-07 21:31:28 Itâ€™s pretty much equal and we have to import a large amount because we donâ€™t produce enough to sustain ourselves
general 2022-07-07 21:32:57 Tbf theyâ€™re a part of opec
general 2022-07-07 21:34:15 OPEC puts limitations on oil exports
general 2022-07-07 21:34:22 Yeah youâ€™re right ab that too
