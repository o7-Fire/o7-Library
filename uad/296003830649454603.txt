plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:34:58 the map is kinda small, but its def enough to test all vehicles you can think of
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:35:06 except light speed planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:35:13 those guys go across the map in seconds
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:35:47 maybe add some decoration to the ocean
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:35:55 having a giant submarine is kinda pointless since its only grass at the bottom

general 2020-09-01 23:08:32 dont ask me how it works
general 2020-09-01 23:08:45 its not easy to control
general 2020-09-01 23:08:53 and a few gun pews can kill the booster
general 2020-09-01 23:08:54 but it works
general 2020-09-01 23:08:57 and its fun as hell
general 2020-09-01 23:10:03 i just kinda make my own planes and stuff
general 2020-09-01 23:10:12 i dont try to copy anything from real life

general 2020-09-01 23:16:20 they are just giant white bricks with wings
general 2020-09-01 23:16:27 but like i said, function over desing
general 2020-09-01 23:16:37 but even then the old planes have trouble going up
general 2020-09-01 23:17:31 my largest plane rn is a double player plane
general 2020-09-01 23:17:41 it was called project omega team
general 2020-09-01 23:17:44 one guns, the other runs
general 2020-09-01 23:17:55 sadly, you cant really co pilot a plane with 2 people
general 2020-09-01 23:18:01 but it works with a single person
general 2020-09-01 23:18:24 im decent with function and bad with desing
general 2020-09-01 23:18:54 hey guys, can i ask y'all insane og engineers with 1237 degrees in blocky planes
general 2020-09-01 23:19:11 is it possible for a plane to have one person flying, and the other piloting a turret
general 2020-09-01 23:19:29 > full functionality and 0 design planes i hate  because there just flying bricks with super accurate fucken cannons
<@!406873396358545411> this
general 2020-09-01 23:21:32 monke dominate the world with banana
general 2020-09-01 23:22:05 hey guys, another question
general 2020-09-01 23:22:17 what would you say is the buggiest least functioning block in the game
general 2020-09-01 23:22:37 for me, the conveyors
general 2020-09-01 23:22:54 oh yeah
general 2020-09-01 23:23:00 if you increase the range of a piston
general 2020-09-01 23:23:06 the little stick holding the platform goes whoops
general 2020-09-01 23:23:18 "they work"
general 2020-09-01 23:24:10 prob never

general 2020-09-01 23:27:10 i only have 1 vehicle with dedicated fuel, that being my small battleship
general 2020-09-01 23:28:29 my mech keeps falling over even if its perfectly balanced
general 2020-09-01 23:28:40 apparently conveyors dont work really well with movin
general 2020-09-01 23:30:14 damn
general 2020-09-01 23:30:16 more savedata

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:47:59 what matters is that it flies
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:48:01 and that it works
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:49:09 that's a bad mindset
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:49:14 looks arent everything
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:49:27 sure, a pretty ship looks the best
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:49:39 but, a piece of scrap and garbage, still works as good as that beautiful one

creations-chat 2020-10-01 23:01:02 and it works
creations-chat 2020-10-01 23:01:24 and it also is a hunk of junk, it lasts a lot more than you would think

general 2020-10-01 23:05:59 this community is def not welcoming
general 2020-10-01 23:07:57 i feel like this community is like if like a small child built a small castle that hes proud up, uploads it to a community, and they just smash him for every single detail possible and go irl and destroy the piece for not being good enough
bot-central 2020-10-01 23:58:22 ?whois

general 2020-10-05 22:27:26 hey lads
general 2020-10-05 22:27:37 is it possible to make custom made propellers?

general 2020-10-05 22:32:06 ok so
general 2020-10-05 22:32:08 i tried it

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:41:50 alright
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:41:52 i need help
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:41:58 im trying to make a drone
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:42:10 but these custom made "propellors" wont let me take off
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:44:33 
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:44:37 could you point out whats wrong?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:45:13 oh
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:45:35 well
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:45:37 propellors worked
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:45:47 but i needed some to stay toggled in order to keep them on the air
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:46:01 that's what i did
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:46:02 but
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:46:04 they dont even work
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:46:09 they dont let me lift off
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:46:20 do i have to get them vertical?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:49:37 hey boss, so i did the thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:50:06 that's not the issue
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:50:12 the issue is that it wont take off
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:50:24 AND HOW THE FUCK DO I GET PITCH
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:51:12 but it only rotates at 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:51:20 it cant get an angle
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:54:04 where's the indian youtube tutorial when you need it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:55:45 that was the original design
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:55:57 but i need a way for the propellers to stay toggled in order for them to stay in the air
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:56:01 you cant do that with propellors
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:57:28 which one of these read toggle
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:57:51 scroll up
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:57:56 i already tried using motors

creations-chat 2020-10-06 13:36:16 > the internet won't teach you torque, that's why it takes so long to figure out how to make a drone without a tutorial or so

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:38 its basically impossible because of the old coding
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:43 but
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:49 maybe they can make a breakthrough
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:03:29 actually there's a 3rd

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 16:56:48 this server and the community is the opposite of a motivator
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 16:57:00 you get DEMOTIVATED to building stuff you loved
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 16:57:06 what an amazing concept

<@456226577798135808> feels more like bullying
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:02:28 its either the insane amount of blocks in your server
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:02:31 or your wifi is just being bad
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:02:58 damn
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:03:03 😔
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:03:20 well

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:03:44 that's a nice tag
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:03:47 tank*
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:03:58 but maybe the wheels need a retexturing
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:04:12 they feel crotched by a grandma, which honestly i kinda like but we're building a tank here
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:04:34 isnt everything for looks in this server
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:04:37 if not, great
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:04:43 keep building a functional and stronk tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:04:54 understandable
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 17:05:04 you dont want your giant death machine slipping around the battlefield like an ice ring

creations-chat 2020-10-06 22:33:28 great, imma get banned for a salty man who doesnt like new builds

creations-chat 2020-10-06 22:34:54 eh i can understand
creations-chat 2020-10-06 22:35:16 ill try harder next time
creations-chat 2020-10-06 22:36:58 as a person that tries to learn new things, i attempt to do my best at things, it might look trash, but if you look under your giant salt mountain, you might find that old build was a stepping stone for me, to learn how things work, and what works best, that's the concept of learning my boi
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:41:03 well
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:41:18 i just recieved the saltiest "critism" on this discord yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:41:24 my bad
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:41:33 criticism*
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:42:47 a technique thats pretty simple is using water propellors on the side of the ships
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:43:16 heck, if you really need to, i can log into roblox and help you out
creations-chat 2020-10-06 22:43:53 it's trash, but that trash is a stepping stone towards learning
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:45:36 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:46:00 if you didnt know, you can edit how they work, what inputs they recieve, and waht keys you press for them to react
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 22:46:12 you can put them on the side, and edit them to the A and D keys
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:05:56 
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:06:00 revolver attempt
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:06:09 i actually kinda like how it ended up looking
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:06:44 and it looks like a roblox-ish revolver
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:09:57 they are just rockets
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:10:21 they dont really look like actual bullets thanks to those fins
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 00:11:01 looks very poggers

general 2020-10-07 01:59:56 hey lads

general 2020-10-07 02:00:54 to just move
general 2020-10-07 02:00:56 like
general 2020-10-07 02:00:58 if you move the mouse
general 2020-10-07 02:01:04 the conveyor will move that way
general 2020-10-07 02:01:08 is that possible?
general 2020-10-07 02:01:27 tooti, i want to hear 2nd opinions
general 2020-10-07 02:01:30 let others speak
general 2020-10-07 02:01:41 how?
general 2020-10-07 02:24:28 well
general 2020-10-07 02:24:38 i made a keyboard with its own bit that presses down keys
general 2020-10-07 02:24:45 it took WAY longer than i expected
general 2020-10-07 02:26:51 hey
general 2020-10-07 02:26:57 should i share the keyboard typer i made
general 2020-10-07 02:27:06 imma share it on plane crazy if one of y'all say yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 02:28:06 
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 02:28:08 giant keyboard typer
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 02:28:13 it looks horrific
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 02:28:14 but it works
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 02:28:55 qUQjue: it's trash, but it bashes the competition™
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:09:53 hey guys
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:09:56 so i made a guillotine
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:10:51 i need someone to test it with
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:10:59 **has anyone complained about the mods**
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:11:19 so i can send them to the guillotine
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:11:47 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:12:49 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:12:53 its a historical joke
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:13:00 when the french republic was made
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:13:12 they sent anyone who seemed sus of being against the republic to the guillotine
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:13:31 so the joke implies that the mods are the republic, and if anybody complained aobut them, i would send em to the guillotine
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:14:00 
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:14:03 guillotine
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:14:08 (me for comparison)

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:22:16 big
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:04 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:11 welcome to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:18 where everyone hates people who even dare to be new
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:39 thats not bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:43 thats better than my first plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:55 dont know yourself out man
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:57 you did your best
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:25:00 and its your first jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:25:46 i think i can barely see the inspector
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:26:04 now THAT is true
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:27:34 holy
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:27:45 we need to send this to obama, and send the FBI after him
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:34:34 trains are, dare i say, the LEAST popular kind of vehicle in this game
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:34:46 for every 100 planes in a server, you see a train
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:36:20 its too thicc
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:36:36 and also, the current train tracks are barely anything, just barely enough to test trains
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:36:50 would be cooler if it was made to run across the entire map
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:37:25 imagine if it went up the floating island
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:37:26 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:40:46 50% of your name is a letter that is always missing in equations
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:41:04 just a fun fact
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 22:57:20 i was thinking of trying to get a few people and I to start a naval battle
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 22:57:28 but my ship is so big i go at 12 fps
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:02:10 also when the ship unfolds, it has a chance of getting yeeted thanks to roblox physics glitches
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:25:48 now THAT would be awesome
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:26:08 but sadly, the game dev prob wont be able to do it
bot-central 2020-11-06 23:48:08 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:50:27 <@!707621364290289664> do you have a battleship

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:53:08 no matter how blocky it looks

plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:38:48 lets see if i get 12983931273 downvotes by the next morning on my post
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:39:18 i just uploaded one
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:39:20 and guess what
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:39:22 it has wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:39:25 give me updoots
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:40:02 > The hull is so wrong bruh
<@!719168864705052802> worked from memory, and i think it looks ok, never aimed for realism because, its roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:40:44 also that beast really takes a toll on my pc, combined with the textures, and the water
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:40:52 so i dont think i can add much to it
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:41:11 im gonna get purged for this arent i
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:41:56 it has wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:41:59 just not good ones
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:42:03 ™️
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:42:33 yes i know
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:42:50 i also used wedges out, some triangle block wedges 1x3, a few here and there
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:43:26 it has wedges, just not good ones ™️
creations-chat 2020-11-07 00:44:06 alright guys see you tomorrow when my post has the world record for most downvotes ever in history of mankind
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:44:40 it counts
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:44:49 also round ones, forgot how those we're called
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:44:59 now thats nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:45:22 the ship i made was for me to learn about folds, so my first goal was never actual good design with wedges
creations-chat 2020-11-07 00:45:56 now thats a self esteem boost right there
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 00:48:57 noooo 😔
creations-chat 2020-11-07 00:56:20 looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:03:51 now this is art
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 22:34:54 test
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 22:35:00 oh pog i got shipwright
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:17:09 h
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:23:43 my ship is complete
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:23:57 it has a whoppin conveyor engine and like 80 super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:06 and the conveyor engine does most of the work but who cares
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:09 it has 2 naval guns
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:12 4 anti air guns
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:16 a bunker because you need it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:19 aight one sec
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:37 and it looks bad, but it works good ™️
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:24:57 since this community likes to crucify people for not using wedges, i decided to use ONE wedge and ONE wedge only
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:25:04 the 1x1 wedge
creations-chat 2020-11-12 14:25:54 maybe you got it as a punishment for something else?
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:27:47 the one wedge type ship-inator
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:28:09 now imma just wait for someone to be pissed by the design
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:28:43 water
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:29:32 because this community loves em
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:30:52 yeah i've seen the standards here
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:30:56 and since i will never live up to them
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:31:05 might as well see how angry i can get for not using a kind of block
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:31:23 gee, imagine if i dont use BLOCKS
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:31:32 now now, even i have standards
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:32:46 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:32:48 the boat
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:33:11 when the sun turns cold
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:33:30 because you cant ban someone for eating bananas because you hate bananas, unless you own the world
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:33:47 even if that banana is a gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:33:55 you basically have to establish a secret police to do it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:35:01 yes but
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:35:04 this is a lego game
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:35:18 i dont think anybody will dedicate THAT MUCH TIME reporting builds that are illegal
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:35:23 they'd have to go server after server
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:35:41 i guess bots could do it, if the bots we're smart enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:36:22 yeah exactly
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:39:22 nah dont worry i deactivated all noise
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:39:32 and yeah, it is kind of sad i couldnt only use 1 wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:39:55 but my secret plan was to see how people reacted to only using 1x1 wedges, while also learning how folding worked
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:44:06 prob try and doxx me for not using wedges
general 2020-11-12 14:47:54 taiwan sounds cool
general 2020-11-12 14:48:00 fast internet, not a dictatorship

plane-crazy 2020-11-19 00:51:20 so you see, the graphical showcase shown in this photograph that was shown in a plane crazy chat implies that it isnt plane crazy, but another kind of software used, and i used this opportunity to call that image plane crazy 2

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:37:35 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:38:06 are you kidding
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:38:13 the average ping in the us is like 80
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:38:24 at best, i get 200, at worst, i play with 5k
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:38:30 when im loading, i get stuff like 200k
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:38:47 i have reached 500k ping before
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:39:06 i am four parallel universes behind you
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:39:22 <@!652857275769421825>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:44:29 <@!652857275769421825> i got sent flying
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:44:32 im playing with 66k pign
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:45:16 scratch that, 100k ping
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:48:20 i kind of got disconnected after trying to play with 100k ping
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:48:37 so <@!652857275769421825> we call that a draw?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:49:00 
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:49:12 i think this means we both win and lose
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:49:57 so, is my ship stronk?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 02:50:02 if it doesnt lag and go flying, yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 04:06:14 Smol
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:16:00 well images arent loading so i cant give my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:16:42 am i the only one that still gets confused about motor locking and just doesnt try it at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:17:27 like, why do you use tnt in some cases for the motor locks?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:17:34 and i've tried, but i still dont understand them
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:17:57 time to hit the youtube tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:18:34 just rens?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:18:54 should be pretty simple
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:28 taht's a bad thing about disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:33 they dont completely leave your build
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:20:52 i remember making a drone that dropped a multi-terrain car
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:20:58 it looked bad, but it worked great
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:08 conclusion = i suck at aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:22:25 maybe only do motorlocking if you KNOW how to properly use motorlocking
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:22:52 mmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:01 my venezuelan senses are calling that FAKE
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:07 thats a pastelito, not an empanada!!!!!
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:17 google lied to you
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:23 🔫
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:24:05 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:24:09 that gives me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:24:16 but i want to make my special project first
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:24:22 maybe  😳
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:25:30 i want to make a carrousel
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:25:32 carrosel?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:25:40 the thing that spins fast in festivals with horses
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:25:50 but i want to add something ***special*** to it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:29:44 i want to declare that i want everyone with some sort of battleship as his/her pfp i'll fight in a naval battle
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:39:38 yeah

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:12:28 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:14:07 not bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:14:18 also, why is adobe open
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:14:45 its called weight my man
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:14:49 you got somethin unbalanced
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:14:56 maybe the engines are not even
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:16:55 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:16:56 just
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:16:57 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:17:11 put it all on top my man
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:18:46 the entire flimp
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:18:56 well
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:00 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:03 just build around them
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:23 if there is one thing i know about helium and ballast blocks, is that you need to position them right to work, or your entire build wont
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:35 not bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:48 could use some work on the paint however
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:19:53 it screams german empire flag
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:20:23 also, you need to remember how dense your ballast blocks have to be
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:20:29 place em all, and experiment with density
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:21:00 then use ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:21:09 or speedrun copy+pasting
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:22:56 i cant tell you
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:22:59 that is you to determine
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:23:05 thats how you play plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:23:08 experimenting
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:23:16 that a vaccum cleaner?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:23:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:23:40 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:24:30 also, maybe use ballast tanks to decend/accend
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:24:45 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:25:10 well maybe make it a submarine blimp if you get shot down who knows
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:26:00 for my submarine, i used ballast blocks to make it stay put, then ballast tanks to go up and down, and rocket engines to move left or right or forward
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:26:31 nice helicoptefr
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:26:56 thats the back?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:26:59 or the front
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:27:15 you need to put helium on all upper stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:27:21 if not, it will tip forward/backwar
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:27:53 or else it will sink
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:28:51 interesting equasion you got there
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:29:32 so what im getting is that the C musical note i equal to blank minus up arrow backwards L u 6131441 equals to a quarter of a half of a j reverse
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:30:22 jesus
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:30:40 you want the blimp to dive down?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:32:25 <:ElonWoke:589674854798589962>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:32:51 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:33:05 the green looks weird, but i like the body
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:06 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:24 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:26 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:26 just
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:36 its horizontal line of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:38 not vertical
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:34:58 also, you gotta set them up so they throttle full when you press it inmediatly and also change the input button
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:35:27 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:35:31 but might not be enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:35:44 its like 3k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:35:49 but since it is floating
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:35:52 it will be easier to turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:36:00 but there is a posibility
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:36:04 if you put it too centered
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:36:10 it will move literally only left or right
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:36:11 not turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:36:16 so that could be an issue
creations-chat 2020-11-20 15:37:08 the bee plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:38:22 yeah it doesnt fit very well
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:38:24 but eh
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:38:25 it flies
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 15:38:27 thats what matters

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:58:46 guys
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:58:50 i need your opinion on this
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:59:13 me and <@456226577798135808> have been working on a 2 player vehicle, and we thought we had done it
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:59:17 but, roblox had interfered
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:59:43 you see, for the locking system, we use piston to push into a hole so it stays put, this worked on a dummy vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 19:59:58 but when we tried with the 2nd player, it started bugging out
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:00:06 soemtimes the piston just pushed without warning
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:00:17 i think the roblox engine doesnt like 2 different vehicles being connected
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:00:21 any solutions?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:03:01 this is how its supposed to look
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:03:28 but when we move, it somehow pushes me off the cage and out of the vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:04:32 yo
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:04:34 anyoen can help
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:04:52 we literally tried to make a 2 player vehicle, something people have been dreaming off
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:05:03 but the roblox engine freaks out when we do the locking mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:05:16 scroll up
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:05:33 wait, you have done it before?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:05:39 without it freaking out?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:00 how
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:01 how
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:08 how did you connect it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:22 yeah thats the issue
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:32 the roblox engine doesnt like when 2 builds clash with each other
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:06:40 but how does it connect both?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:07:02 hooked?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:07:04 with what?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:07:34 the only feature that i dont undestand was the key to what i was looking for
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:07:41 gosh freakin darnit
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 20:07:47 well, we tried
help 2020-11-21 20:13:29 yo, so me and my friend <@456226577798135808> tried to make a 2 player vehicle using a big stick that falls into a chamber and locks itself using pistons, problem is, when the vehicle moves, it flings out the stick and sometimes even makes the pistons go coocoo and move by themselves, anyway of solving this issue
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 14:42:25 gucci tank

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 16:10:40 we need to bring all of our saddest lego engineers to find a weapon that easily pwns all shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 16:10:47 what about a shredder MOTH
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 16:11:16 we dont all have 360 rockets

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:08:40 he's adding something new, probably 2 player co op, bigger builder space, new map, rotators, better roblox physics and a ton of new features
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:08:47 or just maybe a block who knows
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:09:31 wait what

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:17:06 the people who got rejected by the community, bots, trolls, people with bad expiriences on pvp, people who got banned
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:17:24 prob a few veterans complaining about the new kids
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:17:37 see that's a bad mindset
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:17:54 because you need to know the context of many to understand a thing in general
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:18:07 i've talked with people who got destroyed by better builds and we'rent able to build
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:18:13 some who build shredder bugs and got bored
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:18:19 others who simply disliked the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:18:42 and a few others including myself have been destroyed by the community for something really stupid
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:19:01 so, there are a lot of reasons to not like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 15:19:34 go ahead

general 2020-12-08 03:40:26 a bob ross like tutorial series on plane crazy things
general 2020-12-08 03:40:32 a chill time where you can actually learn
general 2020-12-08 03:40:46 instead of "HEY GUYS WELCOME TO THE 120897391827TH EPISODE OF HOW TO MAKE A BLOCK, PART 69"
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:41:45 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/785696727759061022/Captura_de_pantalla_144.png its shit like this that makes me question how sane are the people in this community
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:42:09 like, how absolutely bored you gotta be to bully lil timmy who just wanted to show that he learned properly how to build, smh
general 2020-12-08 03:42:20 he prob edited it

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:44:22 even then, this community bullies people way too much for a single bad thing they do
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:44:27 its cancel culture at this poitn
general 2020-12-08 03:44:44 y'all be having calculators that can run mobile games
general 2020-12-08 03:44:55 meanwhile, old computers cant run internet explorer without crashing
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:45:11 keep reminding y'all that this is a toxic mindset
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:45:18 it has effect on people you wont notice at first
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:15 then, why dont we re-structure how the server works?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:20 beginners have their own side of the server
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:49:31 and the "pros" have their own side for bragging rights
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:22 im gonna compile info on this issue
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:25 and have it ready on google drive
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:54:00 or do whatever you just want to do
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:55:26 do YOU consider it good, or did you enjoy the time to make it?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:55:32 if you enjoyed it, that was no time wasted
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 04:03:12 what do you know

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 15:46:39 it is a good challenge however
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 15:47:01 trying to figure out how much hellium blocks and ballast blocks you need
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 15:47:13 its a pretty good way to learn the basics of balancing

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:35:42 no, but the toxicity is a bit off the charts man
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:36:09 like, i've seen people send threats to others for using certain blocks, that's what shouldnt be allowed
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:39:11 that is understandable, but we need to figure out a line in the sand
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:39:20 im kind of just glad my suggestion got picked up at all

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:30:46 hello guys
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:30:51 i present to you
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:30:55 THE YAMATO 2.0
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:31:00 
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:31:07 a complete re-design of my battleship
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:31:23 
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:34:05 you wont be laughing once i pwend you with my battleship B)
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:34:34 this was the original design
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:35:13 ill take that as aMazing
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:35:39 well its def better than the original design
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:36:16 that's as arched as i could do it believe it or not
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:36:24 if i made it more arched, the inner engines would have to be reduced
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:36:29 and this thing already has a hard time turning
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:39:38 i think making it taller, not bigger, should be a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:39:44 it is kind of short looking in the water
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:40:14 i think that's as big as i can make it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:40:18 unless i make it shorter
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:40:31 shorter in like length
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:40:34 cause this thing long
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:42:37 no thanks
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:42:53 you can make it bigger, how?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:43:02 like, thats as big as the tri-fold lets me do so
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:43:49 i think that's the fold i meant
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:44:01 maybe, i just wanted to make a battleship designed for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 01:45:47 a gun

creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:02:18 no, i dont think so, maybe finish it and THEN post it
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:04:31 is following an instruction manual cringe
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:04:46 is that a plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:04:48 it looks like one
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:04:59 which means is automatically better than 80% of my planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:05:38 i still need some sort of ship that would get me expert
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:05:56 my battleship remake, has 4k blocks, but on creations it got 9 updoots vs 9 downdoots
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:06:42 y'all are poobs
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:06:51 we all know that the best plane is the thick tutorial plane
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:08:26 i honestly think it looks alright, not sure what the hate is all bout
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:09:53 can i also join vip2

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:40:34 fun fact
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:40:44 if you hold click while painting, the blocks will automatically paint
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:40:53 so if you have a long line and hold click
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:40:59 you can just paint al ong line in seconds
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:41:26 not so sure in mobile
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:41:46 nah
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:41:52 i did that in 2018

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:43:13 the roblox engine freaks out when a build is in someone else's build

plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:05:26 dont you notice something...off with the physics
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:06:19 something feels...off
help 2020-12-11 17:11:10 hey lads, i need help
help 2020-12-11 17:11:40 you see this? it looks like a very simple water torpedo
help 2020-12-11 17:12:00 and this is what happens when i drop it
help 2020-12-11 17:12:09 it inmediatly goes into the 5th dimension
help 2020-12-11 17:12:26 no matter what i change, the disconnector's position, the ballast density, it literally goes flying
help 2020-12-11 17:12:36 no, it literally just flies off without a trace
help 2020-12-11 17:12:42 not even placing a camera can find where it went
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:12:51 nice
help 2020-12-11 17:13:08 what the hell is an anomaly?
help 2020-12-11 17:13:37 no i dont think this can help much with going forward
help 2020-12-11 17:14:39 ok, new discovery
help 2020-12-11 17:14:47 if i put the main seat in the torpedo
help 2020-12-11 17:14:51 it goes back into reality
help 2020-12-11 17:16:48 
help 2020-12-11 17:16:54 this is what happens
help 2020-12-11 17:16:59 i click disconnect, and it inmediatly dissapears
help 2020-12-11 17:17:12 sometimes my little boat goes flying
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:18:51 hey uhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:18:52 
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:18:56 i think my torpedo has some special powers
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:19:04 when i disconnect it, it inmediatly goes into the dark realm
help 2020-12-11 17:20:02 i think roblox's physics are starting to fail on plane crazy
help 2020-12-11 17:20:08 hopefully the rewrite can fix that
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:20:24 are any of yall expiriencing the same thing?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:20:56 the weird thing is, when i put a main pilto seat on the torpedo, it started working again
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 17:21:04 i think this is some sort of priority issue
help 2020-12-11 17:21:34 when i put a main pilot seat on it, it starts working again
help 2020-12-11 17:21:49 maybe it has something to do with the priority of being the main part of the build?
help 2020-12-11 17:22:17 i mean, roblox physics exist, yeah
help 2020-12-11 17:22:23 but they are updated bit by bit
help 2020-12-11 17:22:52 either that, or some sort of script that rickje uses for special physics is broken
help 2020-12-11 17:23:37 yes
help 2020-12-11 17:23:49 oh

help 2020-12-11 17:25:26 its a torpedo
help 2020-12-11 17:25:34 i COULD have it hanging off to the side of the ship
help 2020-12-11 17:26:03 oh wait ,so like making a special hole in the ship and put the torpedo there, dropping it?

general 2021-01-20 03:37:51 the big brain play is **REDACTED** and **REDACTED**
general 2021-01-20 03:38:07 chat has finally settled
general 2021-01-20 03:38:29 🙏 <:nooo:787097964946259978>  praise our lord obc and admins for saving us
general 2021-01-20 03:38:53 its called folding, using motors to connect together
general 2021-01-20 03:39:08 very common for battleships that are large
general 2021-01-20 03:39:13 but it can be done with anything
general 2021-01-20 03:39:36 👏
general 2021-01-20 03:39:48 you can find the rest of the items around the map
general 2021-01-20 03:40:30 i mean, yeah, that includes movies you acquired illegally, e-books, videos, videogames
general 2021-01-20 03:40:55 you'll learn how to spend 5 hours on a vehicle that doesnt explode
general 2021-01-20 03:41:23 oh no, dont tell me...you're an apple FANBOY?!
general 2021-01-20 03:41:25 raise the alarm
general 2021-01-20 03:41:38 they are ranks, you can get em for applying for them
general 2021-01-20 03:42:02 there are many ranks, big boat master, big plane master, big terrain master, big master, big balls (robot) amster and absolute chad master at block game
general 2021-01-20 03:42:18 its a fridge with a cannon, what do you expect
general 2021-01-20 03:42:31 (robot master)
general 2021-01-20 03:42:55 jaserid
general 2021-01-20 03:43:36 i told you its a fridge with a cannon
general 2021-02-05 23:07:00 i think plane crazy's limits arent the imagination, but the roblox engine
general 2021-02-05 23:07:06 when are we getting the roblox engine 2 please
general 2021-02-05 23:08:30 imagine if roblox actually upgraded their servers, got a good moderation team and upgraded their engine 😳
general 2021-02-05 23:10:15 is "oder" still a word people use
general 2021-02-05 23:11:02 you dont need chill pills, you need a chill inhaler
general 2021-02-05 23:11:56 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-02-05 23:12:51 i dont think i have ever seen general this calm
creations-chat 2021-02-14 05:17:27 <@!420618093438566410> thats a cute cannon, i like it, neat and small
general 2021-03-10 14:51:58 hello gamers
general 2021-03-10 14:52:27 **3 months later**
general 2021-03-10 14:53:11 i mean
general 2021-03-10 14:53:12 i could also make it
general 2021-03-10 14:53:18 im not good with terrain but
general 2021-03-10 14:53:44 scripting is paiun
general 2021-03-10 15:05:40 the end is nigh
general 2021-03-10 15:05:58 did you watch that extra credits episode
general 2021-03-10 15:06:11 a youtube channel
general 2021-03-10 15:06:15 look it up
general 2021-03-10 15:06:16 really good
general 2021-03-15 01:06:00 loads way faster
general 2021-03-15 01:06:03 thats basically it
general 2021-03-15 01:06:26 props on rickje for actually managing to rework the loading system
general 2021-03-15 01:06:40 there's more?
general 2021-03-15 01:07:17 i mean
general 2021-03-15 01:07:19 it would be convenient
general 2021-03-15 01:07:29 but, we have ways of making long stuff
general 2021-03-15 01:07:32 its called folding
general 2021-03-15 01:07:43 okay cya
general 2021-03-15 01:08:58 oh cool copying a design
general 2021-03-15 01:09:06 i mean
general 2021-03-15 01:09:13 copying isnt a bad thing unless you take credit for it
general 2021-03-15 01:09:23 and in this case he's literally claiming to copy someone else
general 2021-03-15 01:09:27 no shame there
general 2021-03-15 01:10:20 i mean not really
general 2021-03-15 01:10:25 its not loading
general 2021-03-15 01:10:33 hold on gonna reset my router
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:14:11 playing this game on mobile is like building anything but you have butter fingers
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:14:30 so its more impressive to actually make cool stuff on mobile
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:14:34 takes more time
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:14:44 but, still cool to do
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:14:57 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:15:27 thats easier said than done
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:15:49 a good tutorial needs to engage a new player into mechanics, but not talk them down like they are a 2 year old child trying to drive an airplane
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:16:05 also, a tutorial needs to be simple to understand
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:16:17 so im not sure its a good idea to make a tutorial about every single block
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:16:51 that mindset right there is why bad games can stay bad
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:17:20 no tutorial is perfect, but good tutorials teach you both the basics and engage you with the game
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:18:26 copying is a big issue i imagine
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:18:58 imo, copying is alright unless you take credit for it
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:19:09 and, since the tutorial leaves so much untouched, you kind of want to know how the game actually works
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:19:43 remember guys, this is advanced lego
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:20:11 we cant just teach them how to put bricks together and just expect them to make the next notre dame
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:20:50 is that...bad?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:21:06 like, if they make a good tutorial airplane, they are learnign the basics
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:21:26 because thats waht you first find on youtube
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:21:43 thats the first thing that pops up when you look for a youtube tutorial, since you are inevitably going to do so
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:21:47 its a cycle
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:22:04 you enter the game, do the mediocre tutorial, feel lost and follow a yt tutorial even if you can
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:22:13 great ok cool thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:22:37 a good flying brick can teach you more advanced stuff about it, same can go for a good looking airplane in design
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:30 alright, imma say it, motorlock is not an essential part of any plane, it makes it better and more compact, but it is NOT something beginners should learn
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:37 to this day, i still do not know what some blocks do
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:41 because nobody uses them
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:25:18 why not introduce other blocks apart from the main ones, and then introduce more advanced tactics, like motorlocking and glitches
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:26:30 looks pretty good, no idea what its supposed to be, but it looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:26:49 like what is that, an airplane or a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:27:00 we want to make the game fun, not a chore
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:27:30 does this person know roblox's main audience is for kids
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:28:13 bruh ive been playing for 2 years i've seen it
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:28:16 thats roblox
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:28:25 its for kids, but there's stuff for everybody
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:28:39 this is for everybody that likes building and engineering
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:29:24 so, what did we learn from this conversation
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:29:35 plane crazy is old and stupid and needs some reform to adapt to new audiences
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:30:05 wait, there was new content in june?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:30:45 now if only the entire dev team wasnt one person doing everything
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:31:16 hello
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:32:14 lines are a bit over the place, too light in some places, but the coloring is alright, its a bit wobbly and noticeable in the brown parts, but overall, nice

plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:21:10 is this a time machine
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:24:24 so
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:24:33 for the first time ever, i used motorlocking for something
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:25:01 and its not even that impressive, just to align a turret to the center since its a 6x6 wide thing, the center has to be in the middle of 2 blocks, so i used motorlock for that
creations-chat 2021-03-27 16:34:36 maybe try something new? its good to experiment with different kinds of builds on ground, water or air, maybe two of each or all three, who knows what you can build
creations-chat 2021-03-27 16:37:41 thats pretty good, really good angles for a realistic helicopter, but not too realistic, that should appease the veterans who hecking lose it  when they see a single brick out of place, with some paint, i'd say that could get positive updoots
general 2021-03-27 16:38:30 ah
general 2021-03-27 16:38:46 so he plagiarized a build the laziest way possible?
general 2021-03-27 16:40:26 maybe just like leave him alone? he should have learned his lesson by now
general 2021-03-27 16:40:31 harrasing him wont do anything
help 2021-03-27 16:41:58 maybe like a somewhat light brown and then a light yellow?
help 2021-03-27 16:42:18 i think there are websites dedicated with RGB colour palletes so you can find the colour you are looking for
help 2021-03-27 16:42:28 hmm
general 2021-03-27 16:42:53 people like you make me lose hope in humanity
general 2021-03-27 16:44:15

general 2021-03-27 16:45:21 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:46:01 if your plane only works on 0 gravity it cant fly
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 16:46:22 with 0 gravity it means there's literally nothing pushing down your plane, if its that weak, then give it more horsepower
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 19:48:01 that is a sin
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 19:48:06 actually, two sins
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 19:48:16 you snipped it like garbage and you have more than 30 tabs open

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:29:15 motor 2 in general is very buggy
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:29:21 put it in water its dead
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:31:08 could be
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:32:39 it still breaks when you put it in the water
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:33:05 heck because of that sometimes doing functional rutters can be kinda hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:33:14 since normal motors dont have max angles
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 01:33:21 you have to position the motor2 really high
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:21:55 damn
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:22:04 we really need train rails to be more popular
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:22:05 the current ones are doo
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:25:42 man
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:25:56 i just went and documented all the builds i had saved
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:26:05 it was fun revisiting
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:26:08 all of my old projects
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:26:56 just ignore him kirby
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 02:27:07 that guys is prob one of the most toxic people i've seen here

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 00:28:19 yay
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:32:01 making ai is not as easy as it seems
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:32:10 SPECIALLY for a game as complex as pc
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:32:36 you gotta configure the ai, the controls, teach the ai to use the controls and fly, to learn how to shoot and locate you, etc etc
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:00 i do
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:03 if they worked properly
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:13 i have PTSD from AI because of civ VI
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:19 the ai was so bad i kinda stopped playing
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:50 too bad at decision making
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:58 bad decision making ai on a strategy game
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:34:01 not a good combination
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:34:13 PLEASE, add cool stuff to the ocean like corals and fish
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:34:29 we do need a new map
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:34:42 me, im gonna make a giant sushi machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:35:04 im not saying fish that moves
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:35:13 literally just meshes of fish and water animals
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:35:21 no kidding
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:35:31 this game is, what, 10 years old'
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:02 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:30 motor2 is prob the buggiest item i know
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:38 put it in water? it dies
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:42 spin it too fast? it dies
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:41:52 you went a bit far with the autism
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:41:58 but, yeah thats kind of accurate
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:42:46 i am, and i still dont really like usign that world at all, would prefer brain damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:43:17 its comedic

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:03:20 not possible
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:03:33 sadly, roblox physics dont do good with containers and things inside them
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:03:40 i know this because i've done 3 giant blenders
general 2021-04-23 04:05:07 incredible
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:25:05 yo
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:25:14 we could be hitting 20k soon
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:32:28 summarizing <#384025409945337856> in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:36:56 this is like expecting a child to make a giant mansion out of lego blocks he started playing with a week ago
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:39:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:39:42 but not everyone is a mozart jon paul eiffel beethoven engineer
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:41:07 it doesnt help that mods dont take <#507673335816126509> seriously
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:41:10 and i dont blame them
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:43:49 it looks like a beyblade spinning in the middle of the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:44:29 okay but like
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:44:33 thats so much wasted space
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:44:39 design wise
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:44:47 there's so much space lost
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:44:50 and so much ocean
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:45:06 plus its kinda easier to just plop everything together like a giant flat earth
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:45:22 with individual islands, you have to use the funky roblox terrain tools for each individual island
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:45:35 im not discarting the idea of islands as a whole
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:45:39 just a giant island with everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:45:53 like a massive train track, airports, volcano, sand biome, beaches
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:46:42 you telling me that little piece of train track counts?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:46:49 no, thats a childrens set of tracks
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:46:54 we need like an actual track system that makes sence
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:02 not the current one
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:10 you know the current rails?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:16 like the ones on the current map?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:19 those are garbage
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:27 we need something that surrounds the entire island/map
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:36 with turns, straights and splits
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:47:49 another factor is land vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:48:01 unless you make the central island big af, land vehicles will be much more restricted
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:48:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:48:37 the big space between islands makes the central island much more restrictive, even if it was big
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:48:44 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:49:13 OHHH
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:49:17 where you are a robot pirate?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:49:23 and like 12 factions
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:49:31 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:49:38 no, no idea what game that is
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:19 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:22 we need to add ocean details
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:36 submarines are basically useless because there is NOTHING to explore
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:43 oh, and those water ramps in the current map?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:45 who uses them
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:50:46 tell me
general 2021-04-23 04:51:13 does anyone here use the floating ramps on the current map
general 2021-04-23 04:51:16 just a question
general 2021-04-23 04:52:15 not safe for work
general 2021-04-23 04:52:23 you cant show it to your boss without getting fired
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:52:57 honestly, to think about it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:53:14 plane crazy rn is a incredible concept with mediocre physics and mediocre map
general 2021-04-23 04:53:59 yeah its a neon star fusion wench
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:54:09 but are they useful
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:54:19 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:54:30 we need like an actual designated speed course for water vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:54:35 like maybe a lake or smth
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:55:00 man
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:55:07 imagine being able to like walk inside submarines
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:55:42 you know what would be fun tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:55:51 like, a marsh island or something, for amphibious vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:56:00 with a swamp
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:57:44 too bad rickje has a case of "sussiness" and wont hire any devs
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:58:31 you know somehting that could be expanded on
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:58:34 the innovation bases
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:58:38 those places could be so much cooler
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:58:47 but no just like 2 rooms with useless stuff unless its winter or summer
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:59:20 no, a rocket site
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:59:25 for a spawn place
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 04:59:37 so you can launch rockets from an underground bunker
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:00 the 3 big planets
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:05 the rest are irrelevant
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:13 but that brings up another point
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:15 space
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:17 there isnt any
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:31 i made a weird brick that was just helium blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:42 and at like over 1M studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:45 there was nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:00:51 <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:01:00 that could also work
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:01:50 if we ever gonna have 20 players on a server
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:01:57 we would all need gamer pcs and 10 gigabit connections
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:02:11 and roblox servers next to our house
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:02:30 you cant even get a gaming pc for that money, you would get a server pc

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:55:35 man
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:55:41 when it comes to flying vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:55:47 people are the most picky about how they look
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:56:10 compared to cars, trucks, trains, boats, ships, submarines, planes are the ones with highest expectations
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:56:23 oh well then you will love my builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:56:28 like a giant blender

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:58:13 which is why i suck at it the most
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:58:22 i am not good with aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:58:47 the only planes i have saved are an old brick of a plane, a spy car carrier, and a 19 block small plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:58:57 compared to like my 12 ships and submarines
general 2021-04-23 22:59:48 i can give it a go

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 00:01:02 great
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 00:04:09 great
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 00:09:39 
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 00:09:45 yo it works
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:35:19 wait, are thsoe gears?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:35:37 do they work like gears?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:06 how do they work
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:11 they are just circles
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:25 that doesnt explain
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:27 what does fabric do
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:35 WHAT DOES FABRIC DO?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:41 does it add more grip?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:42 is it magic
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:17 what
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:23 i thought material was just
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:24 cosmetic
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:03 i've been playing sicne what, 2018?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:13 never knew materials actually affected friction n tuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:51 i thought it just made your tanks look more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:39:12 or like at the very least to use glass
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:39:21 never messed around with other materials
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:40:00 damn
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:40:04 never knew that was a thing in the game
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:42:55 block 0.9 exists
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:44:17 make a blender
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:44:19 a toaster
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:44:21 a microwave
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:44:48 btw could you get a different angle of this build, im still not sure how these gears are connecting with each other
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:04 sure there's the grip and friction, but how do they actually collide
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:29 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:25 oh darn it works
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:50:17 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:50:24 now imagine if i could put tracks on these gears
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:51:05 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:51:07 how do i make one again
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:51:13 i've made one before for a tank  but it was sloppy
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:54:25 uh
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:54:33 are you sure about that bottom part
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:54:36 kinda looks like a teapot
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:09 
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:10 alright so
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:12 it works
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:24 the gearbox
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:33 but i wanna do something more interesting
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:44 yes basically
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:54 LOL no
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:18:58 i wanna make something cooler
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:19:08 because i have a better idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:19:25 a machine that tracks your mouse position
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:19:29 like, exact position
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:19:53 its a lot harder than it sounds
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:20:08 the only thing that can track your mouse is the motor2
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:20:14 and maybe the control srufaces
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:20:46 link it then
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:20:49 i wanna see it
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:23:04 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:23:32 if i search mouse tracker, only 2 things come up
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:23:37 from 2 different bots
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:23:58 of 2 people suggesting mouse tracking
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:34:56 quick question again
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:34:59 what does the paint block do
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:35:53 ah
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:54:48 i think its because of materials
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:55:04 funky

plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:45:46 like an actual potato?
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:45:49 that can walk?
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:46:11 i mean making things walk properly is already a challenge, make it an uneven balanced torso, and you got yourself a brilliant puzzle
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:49:43 i think it could get approved
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:49:46 just get creative
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:49:57 maybe give it arms or smthn

plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:31 yo
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:44 so i challenged myself to make a ship that uses water wheels as engines
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:49 and now i see why they are irrelevant
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:41:35 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:41:42 someone opened the tank like a bottle opener
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:46:24 yeah thats how shells bounce off tank armour
creations-chat 2021-05-12 00:05:51 -9 upvotes, yeah thats about what i expected
creations-chat 2021-05-12 04:32:24 i'd like to make a shoutout to the 2 people that upvoted my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:26:16 shoutout to the 6 people who upvoted my ship

plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:30:28 its a dragon alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:30:34 the tail is kinda weird tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:30:36 its an arrow
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:30:45 but hey its very impressive
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:30:59 wait holy heck i just realised, thats the default discord icon now
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:31:00 jeez
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:31:03 the revamp is wild
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 16:31:35 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:19:39 behold
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:19:40 the ironclad "el zapato"
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:19:50 gave myself a challenge to make something run out of a water wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:19:54 but also really small
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:20:15 
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:22:15 (btw the name literally translates to "the shoe" in spanish)
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:25:25 31
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:25:38 yeah this thing is not fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:25:41 but its compact
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:26:19 yeah it looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:26:23 prob my best designed thing yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:26:28 nice
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:27:49 if you think your build is bad, wait until peopel see my record of uploads in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:30:10 btw, this is how el zapato looks like underwater, simple water wheel (which sucks tbh) and a rutter
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:32:17 plus, i know most ""criticism"" here is just hate talk, but there are a few people who give genuine opinions about your build, so dont throw them all off as "bad" or "hate"
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:34:08 an accident has ocurred
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:34:35 its cheap and compact tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:35:04 not sure what you expected from an ironclad running from a single water wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:35:23 hell water wheels can handle max 100 blocks before moving at snail paces
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:35:27 but i like what i built
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:35:53 yes, but it makes the thing bulkier and bigger
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:37:55 dont take <#384025409945337856> seriously, someone got 400 upvotes by uploading a single block
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:42:47 can i say i really like ironclads, they are cool and not as popular as galleys or wooden ships or destroyers and stuff, they were like the stepping stone into the modern era for naval development and they are ignored
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:44:49 i agree with this person
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:50:19 im putting this in the "pcc cringe compilation folder"
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:50:28 sure, hit it
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:52:36 oh a hovercraft?
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:54:20 never heardo f them
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:54:22 but
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:54:38 make sure your ship's weight can be carried by what drives it
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:54:55 if your ship is too fast or light, its gonna go flying off and unbalance itself, if its too slow, its gonna be... well too slow
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:59:18 aha lright
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:59:25 well i think you should be good then
creations-chat 2021-05-13 17:03:24 <@!653059099533115423> good plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:10:08 its a big ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:13:28 weird but cool looking submarine
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:13:46 yessir
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:14:23 it really does
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:17:11 YOU are poo
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:17:13 😎
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:17:20 man
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:17:31 im trying to make a pinball machne
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:17:50 problem is, the motors for the things that hit the ball are too slow and dont give enough force
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:18:01 i thought that putting more motors would make it faster, and it did not
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:18:12 4 motor2s on 50 speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:18:17 no change
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:18:23 and every single one is moving freely
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:19:13 wait
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:19:16 i think i fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:21:10 uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:26:16 does your ship have any motor2s
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:27:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:27:49 yes we know what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:27:58 motor 2s are known for being buggy messes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:28:08 if you put them in water, they are gonna freak out and fling your ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:31:54 ignore them
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:31:57 they are literally useless
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:32:16 as a shipwright IV™️ i have never used those ramps, ever
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:32:54 rickje is working on a new map
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:32:59 which hopefully will be decent
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:47:13 hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:47:21 any ideas on how to make something very "wobbly"
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:47:45 like, you know those boncy things in pinball? where the ball bounces off them?
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:47:53 im trying to replicate those too with suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:47:59 problem is its not working
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:48:10 i dont think ropes can work
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:49:27 there's a problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:49:39 i cant get angled pistons
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:49:47 and how would i trigger each piston on each bouncy thingy
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 02:50:48 ok i think i got something that could work
general 2021-05-16 02:57:13 hey
general 2021-05-16 02:57:18 
general 2021-05-16 02:57:27 why is the bottom suspension anchored
general 2021-05-16 02:57:39 its literally stuck in place
general 2021-05-16 02:57:51 stiffness is literally at 0
general 2021-05-16 02:57:56 i dont know why its anchored
general 2021-05-16 02:58:24 would string work better?
general 2021-05-16 02:59:43 really?
general 2021-05-16 02:59:53 how would that work
general 2021-05-16 03:00:00 motors cant bend
general 2021-05-16 03:00:02 can they?
general 2021-05-16 03:00:11 OH NO WAIT YOU MEAN
general 2021-05-16 03:00:12 one sec
general 2021-05-16 03:00:56 damn that work
general 2021-05-16 03:01:46 what is reset on a motor?
general 2021-05-16 03:01:56 like, the setting
general 2021-05-16 03:02:17 damn if that only worked for unpowered motors
general 2021-05-16 03:03:19 doesnt work on motor2
general 2021-05-16 03:05:35 ok cool it works with ropes
general 2021-05-16 03:05:36 finally
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 03:28:55 too late
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 03:29:00 but thanks for the contribution
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 05:19:10 a

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:24 pinball
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:19:06 tordbot! ngl, the head looks outta proportion, too tall
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:21:08 ...that's how the original tordbot looked like, also, i think his username is epic, also also you shouldn't criticize someone for their gamer tag, also also also people who use the word cringe in 2021 are not epic
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:23:18 this is literally <#504436696021204992> , we get hate talk all the time and we never ask for it, and yet we get it🤡
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:26:10 LMAOOO that was a good movie
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:27:34 bruh why isnt the limit 50 mbps per upload
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:59:24 you casuals, you know the more xXxxIIIXX's you have in your username, the cooler you are 😎
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 16:39:58 perfect balance
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:43:24 i guess my pinball machine became irrelevant
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:47:12 jesus, what do you think of my pinball machine?
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:51:28 oh my god, its a plane!
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:56:23 imagine if mods become your lawyers, and they have records of every single thing built in plane crazy ever
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:56:54 so they have to defend your case of copyright infringement on a design that you allegedly stole
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:57:27 people hate copying because its copying
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:57:31 has a bad stigma
general 2021-05-17 02:58:39 inhumane but effective
general 2021-05-17 02:59:25 does
general 2021-05-17 02:59:34 has this guy never played plague inc?
general 2021-05-17 02:59:46 you know the virus can mutate and the protection your inmune system is useless
general 2021-05-17 02:59:58 literally ruining the entire point of exposing everyone
general 2021-05-17 03:00:38 actually, lets to the math

general 2021-05-17 03:01:28 ok, so .3% of the world population is 23.400.000
general 2021-05-17 03:01:40 if all of them die
general 2021-05-17 03:01:48 thats gonna affect a good chunk of the world
general 2021-05-17 03:02:02 cause that .3% could be full of bankers, world leaders n stuff
general 2021-05-17 03:02:54 humans suck at maintaining high populations
general 2021-05-17 03:02:56 like every animal

general 2021-05-17 03:06:08 we are literally monkeys but smarter with less hair
general 2021-05-17 03:06:23 and even if we arent animals, we are damn close to being them
general 2021-05-17 03:06:46 exactly, explain that to inephus
general 2021-05-17 03:06:54 what

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:09:45 yoooooooooooo
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:09:55 positive net upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:00 i am not a failure dad!
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:25 aerodynamics are such a mess to deal with
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:30 i suck at aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:47 i dont make planes anymore because partially how hard they are to configure
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:02 if i do make something in the air, its prob a balloon kinda air vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:41 the biship
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:46 its great
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:12:51 honestly, sounds like a great strategy
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:15:26 the map is honestly the easiest part rick could improve the game on
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:15:42 its not that its easy to make a giant butt map, but a heck of a lot easier than reprogramming the game
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:21 and make it detailed
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:39 if you have a submarine, its boring to be underwater
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:44 literally only grass underwater
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:17:53 you can hit the glitch point in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:11 where the game starts funkin out and the graphics start lookin like digital broken lego
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:51 i use an old style conveyor drive for my giant battleship
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:19:04 it goes at 60* speed, pretty good for an old design and a giant ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:08 conveyor engines are really funky
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:21 prob glitchiest source of speed and mobility in the game

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:49:41 okay
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:49:44 so i have this idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:49:55 giant beyblades with a giant beyblade stadium
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:12 when they spin fast enough, a disconector will drop em into the stadium
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:19 and they fight
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:52 so you're telling me this has been done billions of times?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:58 ***how big tho***
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:21 dude that was 3 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:47 okay, what if i make the beyblades burst
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:56 like actually burst like the new series ones
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:52:22 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:52:44 now, i need to come up with a design for the beyblades
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:53:18 will prob have a suspension on the inside holding the top, when i want them to burst, a disconnector will disconect them and the beyblade's top part will go flying
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:53:32 or maybe a spring
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:54:38 i think its weird
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:54:51 what happened in the front? kinda looks like the track broke

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:19:21 new engine design for a potential new ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:19:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:17 the front wheel has 2 super rocket engines that make it spin, it has a hinge attatched to it that goes to the 2nd wheel, making it move
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:25 not very effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:27 BUT
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:34 it will be an engineering challenge im willing to take
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:48 with this design i can get speeds of a whopping 18
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:18 for context, this small thing with a water wheel goes at 36
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:24 so its not very effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:35 oh yeah i've seen it
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:35:25 
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:35:26 uh

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:40:31 this thing doesnt stop spinning
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:40:35 im throwing everything at it
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:40:45 and it stabilizes itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:43:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:43:05 and when i stop it
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:43:12 even though it has a pyramid wedge as a tip
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:43:15 it stays balanced

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 21:02:26 maybe it is
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:05:18 i remember i made a box plane bomber, it could barely lift itself from the groun

general 2021-05-28 22:39:19 man
general 2021-05-28 22:39:40 ngl, rickje, i think those colour choices will make someone save by accident
general 2021-05-28 22:40:04 has that not happened before? liek yall work hard on a build, save it, delete it, and save it again instead of loading
general 2021-05-28 22:40:32 on your eyes, yes, on your brain? uhhhhhh
general 2021-05-28 22:40:43 depends tbh

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:32:51 thats it
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:33:01 i avoid using motorlock as much as possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:33:12 no, but hey, who cares

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 01:58:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 01:58:39 i am good with ships, i am not good with planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 01:59:09 well, gotta start somewhere right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 01:59:38 
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 01:59:40 this is what got me shipwright IV
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:00:18 BREAKING NEWS: no new ranks have been won since the new update to the rules
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:00:43 yes, they are giant ships, that move, thats the point
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:00:51 they dont gotta be beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:00:55 they gotta work
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:01:12 that they are giant ships?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:01:15 with cool guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:01:39 yes, but im proud of what i made, def learned a lot about ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:01:52 go for it
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:02:00 you can gain access to the vip servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:04:37 then nothing is gonna get approved, creations already have giant standards
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:05:00 if new people who want to get a rank try to get a rank with new requirements, they gotta be making some mozart picasso stuff to get shipwright 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:05:21 yes, thats how it works my man
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:05:34 i think my best build has +15 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:05:54 in creations, design is everything , actual functionality is thrown away
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:06:09 sure people shouldnt be making bricks, like me
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:06:43 even then thats downvoted
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:06:49 iuve seen some good stuff get literally bombarded
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:07:01 alr one sec
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:07:22 
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:07:27 this, simple, looks clean, i like it, it flies, thats cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:08:12 but it is subjective
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:08:24 and i bet you are typing an essay on why it looks really really bad and why im wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:08:31 and why i should delete roblox and cry for 16 hours
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:09:14 right now, its up to the mod reviewing the build for the rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:09:23 and they decide where its good or not
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:09:50 the current standarts for a thing is "does it do what it says it do", "how big is it" "does it work without outside properties", and thats it
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:10:11 we can whine and discuss about design, but unless you are going for the experts or design, thats how it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:10:37 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:10:39 deal with it
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:10:48 🚎

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:11:45 standards and toxicity levels will take down anyone who is new to plane crazy and is trying to learn
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:12:01 no im talking about how people gang up on others becasuse of an exposed motor lock, thats toxic
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:12:22 i honestly think the downvote upvote system causes more harm than good
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:12:45 its just asking for approval of others, which sounds good in paper except when people make literal computers in this game, people get high expectations
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:13:27 damn, why didnt i think of that
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:13:36 you should be a therapist
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:14:14 no i dont have enough good builds to get good ratios <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:15:58 thats kinda one of the issues
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:16:13 you are either getting good criticism or a mob marching to your home for an exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:19:17 i wish i could have that
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:19:54 thanks for the feedback, the cube with wings now flies with ease!
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:28:53 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:30:35 heck, my flagship ship that got me shipwright IV has an old conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:30:47 its like 100x more compact than 300 super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:30:51 and is faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:31:52 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:42:37 it took me 4-5 hours to make the build for IV, i cant imagine how much more i'd have to do including design since creations wants picasso ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:44:22 oh my god
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:44:43 you have almsot every expert role except expert vtol
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:44:45 actually, what is vtol
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:44:59 so like a heli?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:45:07 a quadcopter?
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:45:12 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:45:22 i think i can actually apply for that role
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:45:38 ngl, you're better off doing meme/joke builds to get upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:45:44 its easier
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:46:11 design
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:46:16 i made a giant guillotine
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:46:20 thats how i have designer I
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:46:33 i got designer 1 with a guillotine
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:47:17 yes, you can make that argument for a lot of things
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:47:28 for example, my guillotine isnt a meme, its a execution tool
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:48:20 i remember someone posted a single block and got 400+ upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:49:36 you know ,we need to encourage that
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:49:44 people actually uploading builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 02:49:56 cause ive seen some really good stuff that people wont post because they fear of the mob

creations-chat 2021-06-11 14:59:05 tips for <#384025409945337856> 
1. dont make anything that flies, that's the area with the most competition and good builds
2. make something creative that is unique enough to stand out of most builds
3. focus mostly on design, then make the thing actually work, or even better, make something that doesnt have mechanical function and is just design based
4. if you are doing any kind of vehicle, motorlocking is kinda a must, but you need to really get the feel of it to use it properly (i cant motorlock well lmao)
5. if you have any exposed motor locks, you will be executed
6. funni = more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:04:17 <@!380926327210901506> what do you think of my 5 tips for creations

creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:10:01 it kinda looks detatched, like the front is disconnected from the rest of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:11:06 dont think its a skill issue that the propellers of death itself have gravitational pull
creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:12:26 dunno, might be perspective but from that photo, it looks detatched, also <@!389516889501728779> the 6th rule, funny = good

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:38:18 if i could, i would add a scope or something to calculate the landing spot
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:39:27 yeah the problem is
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:39:41 i have to time the release or it will not go forward
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:39:52 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:40:50 really
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:41:04 could you pass me the configuration of the magnet?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:43:55 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:02:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 23:59:58 i wonder what happens when you somehow fuse like 20 blocks into one block
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:00:02 does it become super armour?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:00:30 i propose an experiment
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:00:45 motorlock like 5, 10 and 20 blocks together, and try to cut them with a cutter block
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:01:58 no i dont think so
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:03:23 blocks probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:03:28 with beams the entire beam dies out
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:08:57 think you need to be on a privates server
bot-central 2021-07-02 00:10:55 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:20:29 could anyone join vip1, i wanna do an experiment real quick
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:21:54 please any ranked person join vip 1 i cant do this alone
general 2021-07-02 00:30:35 hey people
general 2021-07-02 00:30:43 where do i ask for mod help regarding someone gettign banned
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:31:43 yeah, i tested it too
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:31:49 they count as 1 block armour
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:31:52 dissapointing
general 2021-07-02 00:33:00 well, according to the rules, i gotta ping a mod to get their attention
general 2021-07-02 00:33:05 that doesnt sound like a good idea
general 2021-07-02 00:33:29 btw WITW, you can use MIDIS on roblox
general 2021-07-02 00:33:52 not sure how on plane crazy itself
general 2021-07-02 00:34:02 i am not rich enough to buy the speaker gamepass
general 2021-07-02 00:36:08 well, if i get banned for misunderstanding the rules, tell my story, <@!195253906333368320> i've come in contact with a guy that is asking me to start contact with a mod asking why he was banned, the username of the guy is earthop1110#5684, he was banned on the discord server
general 2021-07-02 00:36:50 okay
general 2021-07-02 00:37:16 alright
general 2021-07-02 00:37:17 thanks obc

general 2021-07-02 00:41:52 yeah just talk and you'll eventually be able to post creations
general 2021-07-02 00:42:45 <@!725430583035035659> here are a few unspoken rules about <#384025409945337856> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/816316950585933895/852948002401681478/unknown.png
general 2021-07-02 00:43:24 xbox + plane crazy =/= good result
general 2021-07-02 00:43:32 its already hard enough to build with a phone, imaginea  controller
general 2021-07-02 00:44:20 i wanna see them
general 2021-07-02 00:44:26 what are these amazing suggestions
general 2021-07-02 00:46:04 yeah i see why people hate those
general 2021-07-02 21:10:22 you must tell me where i can find this emoji
general 2021-07-02 21:10:45 bruh
general 2021-07-02 21:12:43 
general 2021-07-02 21:12:47 found it
general 2021-07-02 21:14:16 no i just reverse image searched it
general 2021-07-02 21:14:49 wanted a higher quality one
general 2021-07-02 21:15:00 its kinda hit or miss with the quality of emotes
general 2021-07-02 21:15:03 they can be 144p
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:17:12 man i wish the rope block was better
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:17:14 its kinda limited
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:18:02 it reaches this point when you reach a distance from x, y or z coordinates higher than 300k or 500k studs, or lower than -300k or -500k studs
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:18:10 there are also layers to the null zone
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:18:38 the light layer is where it starts off not too bad, a little bit of deformation in text bubbles and 3d objects, but nothing bad
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:18:56 then it gets worse and worse, at one point, the blocks are shaking and unforming out of existance, text is hard to read out
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:19:13 and then you reach the true null point, where your character ceases to exist
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:20:01 the null zone has worse effects on physic heavy games like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:20:43 <:troll_4k_troll:839395021027278859>
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:21:25 same
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:28:40 i wonder if you can make incredibly small planes with motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:28:51 like 1 block width functional planes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:29:50 i have a 19 block plane, its like 3x2x3 blocks big
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:30:11 it reaches speeds of 109 top no pitch, 130 ish top downwards, forgot how much upwards
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:30:31 wonder if we had like a wind chamber or a wind region in the map, where you can test out planes and ships with wind
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 21:32:35 "I got tired of driving my car to work, so I built a self driving car instead."

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:58:59 this man can breathe underwater, dont question it
general 2021-07-13 16:16:03 why cant i see in contest-submissions <a:whyyyhamooood:853123340449742848>
general 2021-07-13 16:35:17 maybe because we both participated?
general 2021-07-14 00:19:05 can yall look into constest submissions?
general 2021-07-14 00:19:12 or is the chat hidden for yall
general 2021-07-14 00:19:59 very sus, maybe it got cancelled?
help 2021-07-14 00:21:03 maybe change up the colours, add some outlines or somethin, to make it look more detailed and more sharp
general 2021-07-14 00:22:05 tidy as in a tide hit your desktop and everythign scattered
general 2021-07-14 00:23:07 both are just as fun imo
general 2021-07-14 00:23:39 although, terraria is WAY more fun in multiplayer, like, i can play minecraft solo, i can kinda play terraria solo, but i prefer playing terraria with friensd
general 2021-07-14 00:23:58 seriously, its super lonely fighting a boss alone
general 2021-07-14 00:24:10 instead, with friends everyone can scream together
creations-chat 2021-07-14 00:25:08 and this, this is why i hate pcc, really mixed if i do say so (not because of the plane btw, because of the community)
creations-chat 2021-07-14 00:28:00 not the first time, wont be the last i bet
help 2021-07-14 00:34:12 i dunno
help 2021-07-14 00:34:26 maybe make it like the lower bit a red ish shade?
help 2021-07-14 00:34:36 try looking at real life examples, and draw patterns from them
creations-chat 2021-07-14 00:35:33 officially, THAT has more upvotes than the actual plane below
general 2021-07-14 04:44:26 what happened to the contest
bot-central 2021-07-17 03:28:42 !servers
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:01:30 honestly we should stop taking ranks and <#384025409945337856> seriously, just talk about your idea or ask for help in <#478584971670454284> or <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:06:19 yes, virtual stuff has an effect on people, surprisingly aint it
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:10:03 conclusion, fuck creations, all my homies hate creations, just make something that makes your creativity flow, that was the point of creations, to show what you have created
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:14:13 i think the reason builds like those are upvoted are due to the creativity behind it, rarely do we see an example of people liking a build not for the details, exposed motorlocks and personal views, but rather due to the nice and cool gesture behind the idea of replicating the save slot of the game in the game
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:18:14 yes that describes basically the average <#384025409945337856> build-hater™️
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:41:18 i like how the last suggestion read by a admin in suggestion log was like 4 months ago
