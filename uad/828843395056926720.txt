general 2022-02-19 20:06:15 so
general 2022-02-19 20:06:15 ok
general 2022-02-19 20:06:47 is it ok that i used one of my builds and "upgraded it" to delete a broken server
general 2022-02-19 20:07:20 i only did it this one time
general 2022-02-19 20:07:26 to delete the broken server
general 2022-02-19 20:07:46 i just wanted to delete it so no one had to experience how laggy it was (before)
general 2022-02-19 20:08:01 it bumped my cpu usage from 20% to 93%
general 2022-02-19 20:08:11 and memory from 62% to 98%
