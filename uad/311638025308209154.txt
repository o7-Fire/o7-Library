The Tale of darmagon (311638025308209154)
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 22:19:22 What can I do if someone is lagging the server?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 22:19:36 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:28:11 I am making a thing, anywhere that you guys think needs improvement?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:30:16 Here it is folded
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:31:12 the outer layer and beginnings of the first floor of a large complex, from the second layer upwards a large turret will be installed
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:15:52 Are people saying that WIP things cannot be placed in creations-chat?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:16 but it very clearly states in rules to put them there
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:30 
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:17:19 ok, just wanted to see clarification as I never saw an exclusive mention that <#384025409945337856> was being discussed
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:07:57 half wedge
half wedge
half wedge 2
Why are there so many
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:09:14 Half wedge
Half wedge
Half wedge 2
Half wedge down
Half wedge down 1x2
Half wedge up
Half wedge up 1x2
Why are there so many
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:09:43 cut in half
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:09:45 I see
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:17:48 I like this anti scam
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:18:36 I hope the thing has a well tuned filter though
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:19:13 if it sets off on innocent players that may be a problem but I trust it
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 03:40:01 <@!404539659440488468> Pilot seats are the exact same as the main pilot seat, except a different color and you don't get teleported to them when the creation spawns, it's good for if you want to control the craft from different locations
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 17:18:29 I cannot unsee
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 17:18:36 
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 17:23:17 I wish the bases were slightly larger and spread out but sadly according to literally everyone the code is incomprehensible and a mess
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 17:24:16 even though to me it seems like you could just change each instance that referenced the dimensions or position of the boundaries and it would work
general 2020-08-09 17:26:34 well, a dyson sphere is a set and forget type thing
general 2020-08-09 17:27:04 it produces energy with little to no maintenance and if damaged can easily be repaired by shooting more sattelites at it
general 2020-08-09 17:27:35 as described by the video, mercury could work for a starter and then other planets
general 2020-08-09 17:28:22 and that only specified the surface area, not the volume, yes you would want to prevent the sattelites being solar sails but you can still make them thinner than currently imaginable
general 2020-08-09 17:29:35 I mean
general 2020-08-09 17:30:03 what else are we gonna do with the already existing and fully active fusion reactors in space
general 2020-08-09 17:30:22 we have
Let it waste away
Make it a thruster
Make it a power source
general 2020-08-09 17:32:05 let's consider fuel, how long could a manmade reactor run for when compared to the sun?
general 2020-08-09 17:32:28 and still
general 2020-08-09 17:33:05 people argue resource but the dyson sphere can still function with any amount of satellites, just the more the better
general 2020-08-09 17:33:17 and yes I know it's a dyson swarm
general 2020-08-09 17:35:50 you do see the problem though
general 2020-08-09 17:36:18 the only currently known way of harvesting all the energy comes from literally antimatter
general 2020-08-09 17:36:30 and what don't we have?
general 2020-08-09 17:36:34 a lot of antimatter
general 2020-08-09 17:37:06 and even then you begin crossing the limits of how fast you can pull from something
general 2020-08-09 17:37:39 a CPU needs a gigantic fan to get the heat out because it is so small yet does so much
general 2020-08-09 17:39:54 let's say you have a perfect containment facility, only one matter atom one antimatter atom at a time, that facility must be quite large to deal with the stress of each time it fires off
general 2020-08-09 17:40:37 and even then what do you get? all that energy is rapidly being absorbed into everything that you don't want it to absorb into
general 2020-08-09 17:40:55 and then there is the containment of antimatter
general 2020-08-09 17:42:26 containment and fabrication of antimatter itself takes quite a large amount of energy so the only way I can imagine is finding naturally generated antimatter which is quite a lot rarer than the stars and planets to build dyson swarms
general 2020-08-09 17:43:21 and even if we didn't use antimatter
general 2020-08-09 17:44:11 what then? manually disassemble the quarks? too bad you'd be using quarks to take apart quarks even then it still requires very specific ENERGY RICH conditions to seperate
general 2020-08-09 17:45:48 so yeah, we either take what we have and use it to make large energy at large cost or pray that something better magically allows us to make large energy for less than large cost
general 2020-08-09 17:46:17 I will stop now.
general 2020-08-09 17:47:33 I say pvp blacklist should only keep you protected when in build mode
general 2020-08-09 17:47:52 but of course the code is too terrible to do anything to fix the blacklist
general 2020-08-09 17:48:25 ohhh
general 2020-08-09 17:48:40 so does ignore self make you immune to the blasts of your own explosives?
general 2020-08-09 17:48:55 that sounds way too op
general 2020-08-09 17:49:40 > tnt armor exists you know
the purpose of armor is to keep the enclosed item alive
general 2020-08-09 17:50:04 that isn't armor that's just a bomb
general 2020-08-09 17:50:22 did-
general 2020-08-09 17:50:28 damn that's slow
general 2020-08-09 17:50:38 well I mean
general 2020-08-09 17:53:10 1.7 minute delay
general 2020-08-09 17:53:56 how does this even happen without ejecting me for connection error
general 2020-08-09 17:54:16 also I hate the random blacklisters
general 2020-08-09 17:54:54 I mean they probably were just so annoyed by a troll they just blacklist everyone and were happy
general 2020-08-09 17:56:05 why is there a constant flow of people joining and leaving
general 2020-08-09 17:58:13 so you are saying that because we are here now we don't know if we don't know stuff
general 2020-08-09 17:58:44 ok that is awesome
general 2020-08-09 18:00:27 Mine is pretty fast, lemme check
general 2020-08-09 18:01:19 
general 2020-08-09 18:06:26 one thing I kind of wish existed was a simple votekick, if >half the people agree then the target player is disconnected
general 2020-08-09 18:07:30 <@!645128367611445248> the votekick is for lagmachines and people who bother others in build mode and people who bypass filter and exploiters
general 2020-08-09 18:08:11 but half the server needs to agree
general 2020-08-09 18:09:00 if half the server agrees then that's either a lot of very salty and unhappy players who now rightfully want someone gone or a lot of unhappy players who rightfully want someone gone
general 2020-08-09 18:09:32 <@456226577798135808> what is your budget
general 2020-08-09 18:11:22 NETGEAR sells pretty good routers iirc, 75 mbps is good for one person
general 2020-08-09 18:12:30 what connection do you use? ethernet is likely best for most setups
general 2020-08-09 18:12:54 hmmmmmmmm
general 2020-08-09 18:13:45 price on the front page appears to range from $125 to $50
general 2020-08-09 18:17:31 yeah that's why I mentioned make it a thruster as one of the options
general 2020-08-09 18:17:50 why leave the solar system when you can DRIVE the solar system
general 2020-08-09 18:18:55 I wonder what licenses you need to pilot a solar system
general 2020-08-09 18:20:05 I mean
general 2020-08-09 18:20:33 you probably don't need all that control for something like that
general 2020-08-09 18:20:42 just let it sit firing in one position
general 2020-08-09 18:21:58 I wonder
general 2020-08-09 18:25:18 likely by the time self improving AI is developed there will be quite a lot of decisions to make
general 2020-08-09 18:25:45 will superintelligent AI be permitted access to the internet?
general 2020-08-09 18:27:02 ok, what about an ai placed in a super compact bare bones computer with a one way remote power injection and no input/output controls
general 2020-08-09 18:27:54 literally just a motherboard and anything else required to operate but as little of it as possible
general 2020-08-09 18:29:50 it's entombed in reinforced concrete inside an insulated shield buried at the bottom of the ocean trench with only a solar panel at the surface and an avalanche on top of the containment, how long until it breaks free using nothing but the vibration of cables? or will it die?
general 2020-08-09 18:32:06 A bare bones computer with a basic self modifying ai entombed in reinforced concrete inside an insulated shield buried at the bottom of the ocean trench with only a solar panel at the surface and an avalanche on top of the containment, how long until it breaks free using nothing but the vibration of cables? or will it die?
general 2020-08-09 18:34:07 I mean, should people be punished for not remembering having slurs painted onto them while exposing them in public?
general 2020-08-09 18:35:05 idea
general 2020-08-09 18:44:40 Please prepare for a wall of text on the subject of singularity AI
general 2020-08-09 18:44:58 what if there's a server room with no internet whatsoever, just some offline computers running windows and a simple self improving AI, the power connection is a solar panel maintained constantly and linked to a simple battery network, the room itself is encased in an unimaginably high security vault, the room is suspended inside a larger room full of high conductivity liquid, the walls surrounding that outer room are 5 ft of reinforced concrete, then 1 ft of insulation, then 10 yards of practically unbreakable metal alloy, the wire and solar panel are protected by the same level of shielding, every square inch around the outer room is watched by armed guards in an even larger room in a mountain, the guards are chained to the outer wall of the outer outer room so they may not even touch the armor of the servers, there is one person in another high security room that is watched 24/7 and has access to the servers and may never bring anything conductive into or out of the room, they may never touch anything ethernet connected, they are chained to 2 guards, how may this system fault?
general 2020-08-09 18:46:10 HOW THE HELL DID WE GO FROM DYSON SPHERES TO DYSON SWARMS TO STELLAR ENGINES TO SINGULARITY AI TO GHOST PINGS
general 2020-08-09 18:46:46 Oh and also there was some router shopping somewhere in it
general 2020-08-09 18:47:34 are yall talking about me or someone else
general 2020-08-09 18:49:08 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, basically you get mad when something is slightly off, maybe they were angry at the pings appearing in the server list annoying them mid game?
general 2020-08-09 18:49:38 ye
general 2020-08-09 18:50:09 On the subject of general disorders and conditions, anybody else have tinnitus?
general 2020-08-09 18:51:21 tinnitus just slowly crushes your sanity the longer you are exposed, luckily some people have it fade away when white noise or something similar happens
general 2020-08-09 18:52:30 I just think about random loud machinery and other noise producing things while having an ac running and that keeps it calm
general 2020-08-09 18:54:33 the one thing I hate though is anything that repeats an obnoxious pattern though like a loud tapping of the ac plastic bits from the vibration of it or a dripping faucet, things that go low and high smoothly though sound nice
general 2020-08-09 18:55:30 I think that gray is eidengrau or something
general 2020-08-09 18:56:00 I think that gray is eidengrau or something, it's a type of gray that you literally cannot define without that term
general 2020-08-09 18:56:36 eigengrau there it is
general 2020-08-09 18:56:48 
general 2020-08-09 18:57:30 eigengrau is when you close your eyes for a while in a dark room and then open them
general 2020-08-09 18:57:54 "Eigengrau, also called Eigenlicht, dark light, or brain gray, is the uniform dark gray background that many people report seeing in the absence of light. The term Eigenlicht dates back to the nineteenth century, but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications."
general 2020-08-09 18:58:54 yeah, I just have leg hurt and cold while shake if I stay up too long
general 2020-08-09 19:00:04 after a while you feel really light headed then heavy and then you either pass out or move to a place to pass out
general 2020-08-09 19:01:02 I am just the worst at sleeping properly
general 2020-08-09 19:01:23 I think I'm used to a 25 hour schedule
general 2020-08-09 19:01:33 
general 2020-08-09 19:02:12 pretty sure we are literally across the world if we are at the same time period but am/pm
general 2020-08-09 19:03:11 
general 2020-08-09 19:04:54 finally a useful map
general 2020-08-09 19:05:21 https://www.worldtimezone.com/datetime.php
general 2020-08-09 19:06:57 Nobody laughs at 9/11 jokes, they only remind people of the horrors
general 2020-08-09 19:14:00 I'll stop broadcasting the time now
general 2020-08-09 19:15:44 someone give me a military time and a location and I'll update the map
general 2020-08-09 19:17:03 
general 2020-08-09 19:22:51 Dammit
general 2020-08-09 19:23:31 I've basically got an upper torso on a parade float
general 2020-08-09 19:30:14 Oh I watched the skyhook vid too
the-dump 2020-08-09 19:30:59 -4.2 frames
general 2020-08-09 19:31:43 I sleep at around never
general 2020-08-09 19:32:05 I sleep when I forget to be awake
general 2020-08-09 19:33:57 anybody else sit at their desk with a blanket for in case you get too bored to stay up?
general 2020-08-09 19:35:18 I wonder what the chances are for it to go full circle
general 2020-08-09 19:35:28 the ai makes nanites that assemble into creatures
general 2020-08-09 19:37:15 I predict at least X% chance
general 2020-08-09 19:38:18 my old office chair broke and while I was finding the parts to replace it was using a solid wood chair, still softer than the classroom chairs
general 2020-08-09 19:38:31 in a week my back ached like crazy
general 2020-08-09 19:38:42 so yeah
general 2020-08-09 19:38:51 soft seat = better
general 2020-08-09 19:39:33 the only thing bad about beds is that you cannot support a computer without extra systems
general 2020-08-09 19:39:40 a full PC
general 2020-08-09 19:40:02 laptop slow
general 2020-08-09 19:40:14 Lenovo laptop slow
general 2020-08-09 19:40:39 for real tho
general 2020-08-09 19:40:46 my phone is faster than my laptop
general 2020-08-09 19:41:24 the specs are *trash*
general 2020-08-09 19:42:01 lemme send an image
general 2020-08-09 19:42:18 I don't have the exact specs as it is a gift and I don't have a good charger
general 2020-08-09 19:42:22 or any charger
general 2020-08-09 19:42:33 it just vanished one time
general 2020-08-09 19:46:10 damn camera disappeared too
general 2020-08-09 19:47:07 what
general 2020-08-09 19:47:54 last I checked those abilities are not listed anywhere
general 2020-08-09 19:48:27 
general 2020-08-09 19:49:06 where does it say "private servers allow control of pvp" then
general 2020-08-09 19:49:59 what sort of common sense is "oh if I get a private server pvp does not require joining a special server"
general 2020-08-09 19:50:43 ***no***
general 2020-08-09 19:51:49 one moment as I check both of those hmmmmmmm
general 2020-08-09 19:51:56 forgot to clear my chat
general 2020-08-09 19:52:06 just hmmmmmm
general 2020-08-09 19:54:10 I could probably have gotten a few of those ranks if I didn't delete about 2/3rds of my creations just before they reduced save data usage
general 2020-08-09 19:55:53 I've got 2 finished yet outdated builds, they look like they are missing stuff because they were there before parts stopped having random lighter and darker shades
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:02:13 Anybody got a better workaround for deuterium oxide than hh oxide? The sign filter is quite strict and even blocks out molecule names
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:03:04 I don't wanna say heavy water because there's already a water pipe and that might get confusing
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:03:36 literally any number gets instantly erased
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:05:12 I don't think I've made a folding craft, might try that some day
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:07:53 I understand the pain of painting ladders, my trick is to angle the camera and do it in groups of 1-2 or if you can, angle the camera so it's just without visible gaps and paint it like a wall
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:08:58 this is a good angle for a straight ladder
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:09:39 and yes it is yellow, that's because it's temporary until construction is finished
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:09:50 it is a ladder btw
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:15:16 when submitting a creation to <#384025409945337856> should I ensure it is a full screenshot or can I crop things like other plots out?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:16:16 ah whatever, here's the cropped, finding a better angle and taking a full
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:18:00 I can assure you this is a public server and I am too broke to buy a single gamepass atm but I'll do a full
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:30:18 I am happy that they at least know the bug is a bug and that it exists and I hate it
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:31:23 and motors, even though I guess motor locking being broken has become a thing it still annoys me that it happens at random and at random positions when rotating a locked motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:31:31 damn glitch messing with my giant robot
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:31:54 or as someone stressed quite harshly to me "mech"
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:35:51 probably <0.005 and it was rounded down
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:36:44 is that literally a byte per second or less then?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:36:54 or is it a kb
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 20:46:43 my first plane was a generic expansion on the starter plane that just made it larger and smooth
bug-reports 2020-08-09 20:58:55 Can't quite be too descriptive but it happens everywhere: Lights hate moving, rotating spotlights have random chance to get 'stuck' where a piece of the spotlight stays on an area passed over, any moving light with shadows (and possibly without) has a high chance of randomly turning off and sometimes gets stuck like the spotlight but the light doesn't copy itself, the glow just freezes in space.
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:02:59 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:03:21 <:IntendedFeatureX:706289545250996235>
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:03:58 did plane crazy seriously do a bethesda while ruining every part of my greatest design?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:04:35 I'd rather build a new plane crazy than deal with locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:05:32 who the hell thought it was a good idea to link each block's code together then?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:06:13 it's one little thing, just move the part and all welded sections back a little if it happens to be in the glitch position
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:10:32 at least just rename the lock motor button to compress or something
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:10:41 if it is intended
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:10:55 no way changing the text is gonna break stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 21:12:02 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:27:13 this is the least safe runway ever
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:29:16 you have about 28 blocks to go from flying to stopped
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:29:26 and the safety catch has not yet been installed
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:46:00 Something has gone wrong.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:46:28 the game flung me, took off my head, and welded it back on upside down and backwards
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:47:07 and forgot to return the eye
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:48:05 *help*
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:48:21 I'm anchored
general 2020-08-09 21:58:25 why is it that every time I play roblox memory is far in the red but there is no penalty
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 22:17:24 what do the different materials do?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 22:19:57 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 22:21:07 is this bad? it doesn't feel like much delay and things moving travel smoothly.
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 22:21:23 but roblox says REEEEEEEE
general 2020-08-09 22:28:15 um
general 2020-08-09 22:28:30 uh
general 2020-08-09 22:31:21 Expiredcookie, if you leak any locations or hand them to people other than the owners of that location without the owner's consent then that is doxxing
general 2020-08-09 22:32:06 anyone who is able to connect an image on google maps and the name and plate of someone should know this
general 2020-08-09 22:32:56 oh I have trouble identifying where I live, good luck finding me
general 2020-08-09 22:33:46 lemme do something

general 2020-08-10 19:40:14 just if that isthmus linked to a medium small island and was of equal thickness
general 2020-08-10 19:40:20 I cannot remember the term
general 2020-08-10 19:40:33 but any land with 3 sides of water looks like that area
general 2020-08-10 19:43:26 pretty sure by technical definition, would mexico be an island connected by one side to a larger land mass?
general 2020-08-10 19:43:39 or do I just suck at geography
general 2020-08-10 21:07:42 I wonder what scale plane crazy uses
general 2020-08-10 21:07:52 what unit is "speed"

general 2020-08-11 02:42:36 there are so many things I wish were in plane crazy that will never happen because nobody thought to organize the code
general 2020-08-11 02:42:39 like
general 2020-08-11 02:43:50 even a separation of power and brake force for motors would be nice but that would probably require 6 other things to change ranging from the 1x1 block to the color pink

creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:11:43 searching chats
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:21:45 I like this community, it's nice.
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:23:57 Mechs are too cool for me to make properly
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:24:56 I mean I made one, it was missing legs though
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:26:15 this thing barely qualifies as a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:27:10 It's a manned vehicle that can punch stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:30:31 yeah, those pricks that don't even think about the fact that something you are making might be WIP and assume it's supposed to be missing half the front and proceed to call it bad drive me insane sometimes
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:31:18 also what's with the sudden love for making siren head builds? I see them everywhere now
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:32:43 If someone out of the blue insults my skill I usually just save my work and load this thing or my attempt at a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:33:29 something else as a break from my other things while shoving their words down their throat
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:34:23 it's basically an improved non mech battle focused base
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:34:59 my old outdated mech gets targeted and obliterated before it can even go through the startup checklist
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:36:08 so far this is practically ram proof and any attempts at cutting through the walls leave a cutter filled hole too small to fit through
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:36:59 additionally it will have non pvp abilities such as a parking garage and very short airstrip
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:38:02 the plan is to bury many missile turrets inside the walls and have a main gun above it all
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:38:31 aka: you are not getting in forcefully yet unharmed
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:39:19 I'll stop talking about how I plan on beating up things that break in now.
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:42:19 also, the level of detail is just me trying to draw attention away from the tactical stuff while being armor, also it's just fun to make

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:11:23 Because of the tryhards literally anyone new to pvp needs to use a tryhard design to get a single person
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:14:17 Call me salty then, Idc, if there's a lag bomb in the server or someone abusing blacklist then why not at least give people something to get rid of them, we don't even have a working report system to dispose of exploiters
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:15:40 oh great idea, just let the exploiter win every time no matter what that's obviously the best way to get rid of them
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:16:51 it's just those pricks who do though, if they are let through they will keep doing it or worse start exploiting on other games
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:17:40 motor2 flaps are just a lazy solution to pvp
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:17:58 no exploits there
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:18:06 just a rather annoying thing

creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:44:32 it's technically an octocopter with an excessive all terrain system
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:53:42 though the report system would need to return and it'd add to the horrible mess of code this game consists of, an image block would be nice, gives a lot more options at the cost of some people abusing it, maybe if you blacklist someone it hides their images.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:55:01 figuring out the format an-

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:03:05 [Image (1x1/1x2/2x2/1x3/3x3)]
[Configurable]

A panel similar to a sign or text panel but displays a selected image, the library for such images may range from roblox decals (spawn platform decal, roblox square icon, etc...) to a custom library (upload custom decals) at the developers discretion.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:04:03 tl;dr - images, idk where from but images
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:05:36 yay
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:07:56 Rollercoaster tycoon 2 did it with a lightly moderated library
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:08:47 ah yes, so basically allow everything no matter what
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:09:40 like how one person I had seen was detailing a male reproductive organ yet according to the community that is allowed and if I don't like it I leave the server
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:10:43 a flawless game without moderation is worse than a flawed one with moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:17 apologies
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:25 I had not noticed reports was back online
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:45 yay this game is enjoyable
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:13:18 it's called being unranked
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:14:14 great job polluting the player base then, just hate every new player for noticing flaws in a game
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:30 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:44 olind you very clearly took part in this hatred towards me
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:16:22 the flaws are that I cannot stop people from putting nudes on a house
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:16:53 especially now that I see reports is here but deactivated
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:58 you see, the more players you keep shuffling around with the stupid "if you don't like the rule breakers then leave" the more players dislike the playerbase and the fewer innocent there are, the trolls stay and keep annoying people causing them to shuffle
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:21:50 it was literally a single idea a single concept of one mind that I had thought would be neat and good for exponentially multiplying the capabilities of signs but for *unknown reasons* everyone assumes it is 100% a pornography printer
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:24:22 I literally thought: "what if signs but better?" and came up with image panels, the suggestion of which the community approved of enough for someone else to copy it and apply it for me, if you dislike it don't bully me, just give a good reason I cannot easily counter and it is gone.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:25:24 then I have an alternative idea
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:26:44 paint sheet
building

A panel that consists of 4 paintable squares on a 5th paintable thin block, about the thickness of a sign
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:27:21 it's harder to do bad things with fewer pixels, it'll still happen but in lesser quantity as it requires effort
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:28:00 I used paint blocks a while back while designing a plane
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:28:33 1 block thick yet 6 paintable sides is beautiful for designing detailed interior and exterior while keeping mass low
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:29:31 that's because of the 4 unpainted walls
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:29:58 kinda wish paint blocks had the ability to preset color but again
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:30:01 code is spaghet
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:30:46 I still cannot wrap my head around the monumental tangle they describe it as
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:31:06 did they at least section the individual blocks off?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:32:32 How do people put multiple images in one message?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:33:19 I've got 4 images and don't think they each deserve a vote system as they are all for the same vehicle
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:38:48 https://tenor.com/view/helitank-gif-14340016
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:39:14 I wonder if anybody actually made something like that
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:39:36 knowing the community someone very much did
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 15:08:29 I feel like there's too little one sidedness to weapons atm
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 15:09:03 what if cutters wore down?
what if ammo was limited?
what if missiles didn't appear out of thin air?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:49:32 Why am I allowed to say deuterium oxide but not write it on a sign?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:50:21 *cries in sci fi reactor*
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:51:33 bruh it doesn't even approve of dihydrogen monoxide
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:51:42 literally the science words for **water**
bug-reports 2020-08-14 01:00:31 copy paste stops working on every window except Plane Crazy if copy paste is used for settings transfer
bug-reports 2020-08-14 01:05:55 I usually save my stuff and rejoin to get the ability back, sadly any special moments caught by screen snip cannot be caught as it actually blocks the copy to clipboard function
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 03:56:14 how the hell is there no space for a half beam in 2000 half blocks?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:57:16 I just had an idea: Chimera Laboratory on a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:57:36 you literally take different mech parts and weld them to eachother
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:59:04 basically this but less horrifying
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:00:36 and it can be applied to literally anything, a smart car with a locomotive engine, a plane spliced with a semi trailer
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:22 rope bridge and boat dock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:41 you see
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:50 you take the rope bridge though
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:58 and you make it a boat dock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:02:52 office building and hamster wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:03:06 k
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:04:44 I'm gonna try to take a copy of my octocopter and mix it with a plane to make some strange monodirectional heliplane thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:48:49 excuse me WHAT
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:49:09 its literally a grid aligned shape
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:49:52 how can it take a long time to clone it and teleport the clone to where someone left clicked and change properties like color and material when painted
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:51:29 If I were to learn programming and made the decisions, for the sake of humanity I'd use a copy paste scalable system
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:51:42 just
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:55:13 (The points the block creates welds to and if it consists of many individual linked segments, what to weld them to)
[Determine how large the hitbox is]
[Determine any x,y,z offset of the hitbox]
[All the stuff a block needs to do to be placed]
(Other stuff)
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:55:48 that in every block and bam, you just modularized the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:56:24 in the other stuff is just things like detectors for signals like if someone clicked on the block with settings or paint or delete
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:56:30 properties
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:56:33 etc
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:57:21 I likely am oversimplifying by orders of magnitude but still, if you managed to take the fully stretched out code and sort it into those blocks and into the blocks of blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:57:48 I very much saw that
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:58:26 and I say making plane crazy 2 would be a good idea once this game, an effective prototype is refined the best it can be
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:58:50 but currently there is
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:59:32 yes, as I had just made that writing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:59:54 also probably because it is exactly midnight in this part of the US and this is a mostly english server
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:00:24 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:01:28 still there is a lot of problems with this game such as pvp balancing and the endless glitches and the absence of a proper melee
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:02:12 yeah, but despaghettification is a good start for removing bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:03:22 how to nerf shredders: make parts unweld if they are overstressed (ex, pulling 1x1s apart, applying 4000 gs of force to some wings
requires a lot of physics patches though
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:03:57 I'm talking about a lot of force though
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:04:14 just below the forces produced by going from full shredder speed to 0
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:04:45 you see, there is an alternative
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:05:36 if in the event large non glitch builds break by this fix then an alternative may be applied
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:05:50 literally just make cutters wear out and break off after a little while
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:07:35 as in, if a cutter is repeatedly impacted against a target at high speed that very much would blunt a sword at least, so maybe it loses the tip and becomes unable but still holds together
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:08:51 I mean, if each cutter took out 10 1x1 blocks and then broke that's still quite a lot of damage for metal on metal
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:10:41 I do the simple approach of a wall of knives, if you slam into the wall so much you get harmed by the cutters then that's on you.
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:11:57 it takes a lot of focus to hit a very fast target good at dodging while you yourself need to dodge and fly a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:12:46 there's also the simple solution: blacklist those cutterbug maniacs
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:12:55 I'm a base
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:13:50 if your main weapon becomes ineffective and you are forced to use things like lava spitter, that gives me time to use the 6 hidden missile turrets
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:14:47 it is like if you took a cutter and distributed the damage evenly
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:15:07 yeah lava spitter shredders are just annoying
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:15:32 I say lava should only damage the first 5 blocks it touches
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:16:25 yeah, I've been getting a lot of stupid bugs recently
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:16:57 my """""mech""""" has its limbs fly off randomly now
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:19:42 I am still wondering why motor locking is still a thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:20:09 it presents insanely overpowered creations and produces lag when used in excess
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:20:41 well then
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:20:48 explain why it is "LOCK"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:20:59 and not "glitch parts inside eachother"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:21:51 then why is it listed as a known bug?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:22:21 oh great
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:22:42 "ok the game sucks so bad I give up at fixing it so now all the bugs are actually intended"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:23:37 Each day I pray that judgement will come down upon the motor lock users
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:24:44 just please rick, just add a block that locks motors properly or fix motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:26:13 I exclusively avoid using motor lock as some messy part fusion thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:26:49 how about this perspective
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:28:11 I formally request that motor locking and block fusion be separated in function or the features both be removed in entirety.
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:29:19 Here's an idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:30:00 disconnectors should be given the "contract" option that preforms what is currently a glitch with motors
and motors get their ability to lock properly
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:31:54 I refuse to give up, if locking is broken then I will take coding lessons and try my best to develop a fix
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:32:22 correct
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:32:31 and I will remake plane crazy if I have to
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:33:44 Here's an idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:33:58 add a lock button to motor 2 that actually works
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 05:35:22 I'll just be playing plane crazy attempting to develop an overcomplicated in game fix of motor lock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:36:58 alright
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:02 because devs screwed up the code beyond repair and nobody feels like letting me recreate plane crazy after I learn programming I'm gonna create an in game fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:49 My motto is "one way or another, it's gotta be done"
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:58 so...
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:41:14 current plan is to generate a stable bearing that can support the motor being in any position on a 5x5 cylinder
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:41:27 but if that fails I'm gonna start learning programming
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:42:15 well, if there's an actually active dev team and organized code then the suggestions list can be quickly completed
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:43:16 first I'm gonna try to create a hyper compact motor lock BASED motor lock fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:43:52 after all it's fine if motor lock is fixed breaking the thing as it was there to work around motor lock in the first place
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:44:50 it's kind of funny
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:45:33 either plane crazy
fixes motor lock
I find a compact solution
or
I rebuild plane crazy with a fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:46:36 actually it seems like a lot of the community believes a complete rebuild is required so I might begin taking lessons even if I find a solution or plane crazy fixes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:48:14 starting testing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:52:26 test 01 confirms that the motor lock bug is present
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:00:20 Candidate 01: Spring, 1x1, can be stretched beyond 1x1 position, continuing testing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:01:23 Candidate 01 failure, non locked motors are too weak to resist tension
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:03:12 suspension has passed tension test, proceeding to next testing phase
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:19:38 one moment
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:20:53 first functional stability prototype
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:21:09 compressing and field tests shortly
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:31:47 It appears this is as compact as it gets with minimal risk of breaking if there happens to be a relock error
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:32:57 red parts can be welded to eachother safely, blue parts are the output, and purple is mechanical and must be kept clear of
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:46:42 compact partially enclosed unanchored debugged locked motor
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:47:31 I could compress it exponentially more by destablizing it
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:47:45 when a motor is set to locked it contracts
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:48:12 I built a structure that completely removes that effect from the output
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:49:11 so now you have a rotational point that ignores all outside forces when not in use that also does not have any glitchy side effects
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:49:41 preforming load test
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:50:39 no unintended effects shown from high torque application and stall
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:50:53 well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:51:04 one was just found that is likely easy to counter
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:51:24 when stressed the motor moves the housing perpetually
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:53:00 was fixed with no side effects by applying grip material to the base
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:54:12 ok that's a compact motor lock fix, I'll begin looking for programming lessons shortly, what language does roblox script use?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:55:49 dammit
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:55:59 how similar is it to regular lua?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:00:49 nope
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:02 just did some research and found lua is just very very configurable
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:29 and as it is not object oriented they configured it to allow objects to exist
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:45 if that is the meaning of object they are using
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:02:15 so I'm learning code to hopefully some day design a similar game with a fixed motor lock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:02:42 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:04:53 alright then
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:05:05 adding on to thing I was typing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:06:40 I have assembled a list
0: Preform 1, 3, and 4 with java script oriented version of 2
1: Learn basics
2: make some things in studio
3: learn advanced stuff
4: design a small scripted game
5: start working on a replacement for plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:08:03 assembling a coding hobby/subcareer backup plan in case my intended one fails in a special career server I will set up now
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:08:30 this will literally take a chunk out of my life because I am too angry at plane crazy's poor coding
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:09:14 but hey it's also organizing my life a whole lot better than the plane crazy scripts
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:13:24 <@!311638025308209154> I pinged myself because nobody has mentioned me with intent to help
general 2020-08-14 07:26:17 Here's my plan for a thing to slowly work on during quarantine.
general 2020-08-14 07:26:49 no
general 2020-08-14 07:27:09 ***EAT THE MORNING***
general 2020-08-14 07:27:53 basically
general 2020-08-14 07:28:57 1: Figure out generic coding syntax and such so my brain doesn't think weird when learning lua
2: Learn the required stuff about lua
3: Learn as much as possible about the roblox oriented version of lua
general 2020-08-14 07:36:42 https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg Is this a good starter video introducing basics?
general 2020-08-14 07:37:28 I'm going with JS for a starter as from the beginning I'm already seeing similarities and it's known for being easy to learn
general 2020-08-14 07:37:45 *and because I was told to start here*
general 2020-08-14 07:39:00 
general 2020-08-14 07:39:24 
general 2020-08-14 07:39:29 actually no
general 2020-08-14 07:39:59 creating a programming language is the hardest programming language
general 2020-08-14 07:40:27 there was no screen to insert code into when the first digital computer was being made
general 2020-08-14 07:41:08 there isn't any helper or error notifier when building a calculator
general 2020-08-14 07:42:04 considering they built the first programming language, they probably started by creating a link between something and another thing and kept going from there
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 07:44:01 In a situation where there's something that starts extended
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 07:45:05 either use ropes, that way it works both ways, or use the dumb motor lock glitch that was bethesda'd into a feature
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 07:46:13 sadly ropes only have a minimum contraction point but by attaching suspension it may be set to a target length and try to not go past
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:11:41 ...
help 2020-08-14 09:12:40 I have read the rules and it appears there is a corresponding rank, am I missing a requirement or is a bot bugged or...?
help 2020-08-14 09:13:57 I know it's a useless role but it seems odd that I cannot see it by right clicking my profile and viewing roles
help 2020-08-14 09:15:00 Do I actually need to apply for the role by recording myself reading the rules or something?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:25:33 idea:
general 2020-08-14 09:26:55 I believe I have between 0 and 0 warns but I am probably wrong
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:33:45 Why do people use jetpack?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:34:11 just make a ladder
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:34:23 someone else's base? walk in
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:34:31 they have walls? parkour
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:34:49 they parkour proofed the walls? build something to go over
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:35:13 vungielek
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:35:25 ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:37:17 I feel like this server should have a bot that just looks for any one word 'comment' that contains bruh and tags it with <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:37:38 and das it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:37:42 das all it do
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 09:37:48 just

plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:11:14 When you break a game so hard you improve it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:12:41 I see no reason for this to not be a groundbreaking invention that shatters datastore logic
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:13:21 you literally filled a room beyond capacity without generating a black hole
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:14:18 rick, you gotta be doing something wrong, the only thing stopping people from building is a limit you have set, not a game one it appears
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:24:16 are there 2 centers of mass? this is strange
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:26:58 you quite literally made new storage space out of nothing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:27:39 when the players do better at improving the game than the devs:
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:28:50 might have something to do with undo being broken?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:30:39 my best guess is something about undo or loading 2 things at once or all of the above
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:31:52 like bruh if we can sacrifice a save slot for double block count and increased save data then
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:32:20 ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:33:10 what if you build a creation in 2 halves and then weld them together with this glitch? you could literally have 4000 of each 2000 max block, you could probably double the savedata
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:34:07 oh sorry I cannot count
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:34:33 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:35:29 "noo you can't just make something out of nothing!"
"Hehe lag glitch go brrrrrrrr"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:35:55 I wonder how many console errors appear from this
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:36:37 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:36:55 almost error free clean save data GENERATION
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:37:49 literally stored the creations with greater efficiency than plane crazy can handle
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:38:58 every dev is probably very confused right now
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:39:23 somehow merged datastores or something?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 10:41:03 where tf is that stuff saved? the data limit does not have the capacity to fit all the creation in
general 2020-08-14 10:43:32 oreo thins = placebos that suck
general 2020-08-14 10:44:24 when you
general 2020-08-14 10:45:18 I have multiple copies of important information from other drives on this one
general 2020-08-14 10:46:04 nice

plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:42:12 Please
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:42:21 just let me paint suspension

plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:49:37 that is the judgment day I hope comes
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:51:24 1: Absurd lag when used for nuke compression
2: Overpowered against new players who do not know of the bug
3: Ruins a perfectly good motor function
4: I could write a list to 101+ about locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:52:47 I hate it because the bug completely ruined my mech, has a random chance to delete random joints and they can't be unlocked or the joints slowly move passively
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:53:46 this is why I am taking steps to completely rebuild plane crazy with this one bug fixed
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:54:45 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:55:07 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:55:50 I wonder how funny it'd be if just one day
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:56:02 the glitch worsens and every locked motor crashes the game
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:56:47 it's a glitch, it has no reason to not change in behavior as roblox updates
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:57:43 I don't care if it's ok for me to hate motor lock bug because I do
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:58:00 you can be-
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:58:03 I said
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:58:13 "I don't care if it's ok"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:58:30 you can bethesda all you want once a bug always a bug
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:59:25 the motor lock originated by
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:59:42 > "I hate locked motors because I don't know how they work!"
<@!200793484053970944>  I hate locked motors because they broke my stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:07:26 I got bored so I'm making attempt of an engine
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:07:53 the push part will be at the bottom
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:11:59 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:12:30 just freestyling, goal is something that at least produces fake rotation
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:14:37 the interesting part is that the propelling force will come from the bottom and turn something at the top
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:19:24 hmmmmmmmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:19:59 more of a
bang
bang
bang
bang
but on rails
engine
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:20:27 reminds me of an old engine prototype I thought of
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:20:45 "What if engine but the fuel came from the pistons?"
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:22:16 what sides of this motor connect to the light colored small rectangular prism
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:23:52 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:23:59 nobody likes shredders
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:24:09 they are the mosquitos of plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:24:30 but even mosquitos attack with purpose
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:25:01 > <@!311638025308209154> they need blood
Correct
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:26:23 my solution is simple: be too defense to give them satisfaction, if they take 5 years to chew through a wall then they will get bored.
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:27:18 I have a stationary base and it holds up damn well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:28:40 once they figure out that when anchored no parts will fall down satisfyingly they give up only having blown a small breach into the defenses
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:37:52 getting there
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:44:06 I built a thing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:44:45 the jet based power is so annoy to use so currently I am just using motor power
creations-chat 2020-08-14 14:06:54 I found a cool use for the thing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 14:07:04 as a pendulum drive for a wipeout course
creations-chat 2020-08-14 17:37:12 this is a good and clever use for this system
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 05:31:50 Is this about me threatening to build a better Plane Crazy or is the code literally just if you randomized each word in the dictionary and called it code?
help 2020-08-15 07:23:29 What is this thing I can paint?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:03:14 I'm making a thing
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:07:49 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:08:06 the goal is to create a parkour gauntlet thing
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:30:50 oh, you see, it looks like an inline 4/piston engine because that is what it started out as
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:32:12 lemme get the original
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:34:57 one moment plane crazy is being dumb
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:40:44 here's the original
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:41:21 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 09:50:14 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:19:25 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:19:40 why does nobody paint their stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:20:06 I paint 4000+ block creations
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:21:14 I have never applied locked motors with intent to fuse blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:22:09 damn glitch ruining my ideas
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:22:46 ahem
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:23:16 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:23:32 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:23:46 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:24:53 then why is there a pinned message contradicting such in **bug reports**
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:25:07 either fix the motors or fix the pin
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:26:09 which is why I have begun studying code to eventually create an actually functional version of this game
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:26:23 also is slot gli-
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:26:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:26:59 somehow people have broken the game so hard they fixed a lot of it
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:27:58 fun fact: the launch button is not an accident
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:29:19 the way the code is referenced is making me believe that yandredev coded most of the game
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:30:40 I'm pretty sure devs are being hired to fix the trash made
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:31:25 and not yandredev's code, rather plane crazy's trash
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:32:36 you don't see the code because all who look at it have a stroke unless they are wearing protective gear
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:33:26 I only know how to make a clickdetector and I know that code must be bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 10:34:56 I feel like the guns should be configurable, set spread, enable click per shot, etc
help 2020-08-15 11:10:21 I had a similar problem with my """""mech""""", for me it started working when I went faster while turning
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 11:11:04 wat
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 11:21:51 O w .
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 11:22:03 the void stole my limbs
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 11:26:01 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 11:26:07 delet
general 2020-08-15 11:31:42 how can I legally add 493 upvotes to this
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 12:45:25 somebody claimed my thing was lagging the server
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 12:46:58 that's like saying 5 small creations spawned in is lagging
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:16:30 I just had an idea, what if there was a sign that instead of holding text just held one of many images assembled in a library ranging from a computer screen to a fake service panel to a nonstandard spacetime warning
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:17:09 like a garbage version of the other thing I was thinking about
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:18:37 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:19:00 actually that's a great idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:19:19 then people can upload custom decals too!
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:19:45 only concern of my part is people just grabbing letter decals and using that to spell things
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:20:18 fine then
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:20:28 custom handpicked library again
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:20:39 quintouple the effort
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:21:16 but do emojis have warnings such as a flammability diamond?
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:21:43 I want to inform people of the hazards of my horribly unsafe creations
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:22:44 how does one generate this image with unicode?
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:24:22 I want warning signs
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:24:30 that is all
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:26:18 If rick sold a working locked motors gamepass I would buy 10 of them somehow
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:30:03 The map really needs a lot of touchups or something
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:30:18 perhaps an expansion to behind the base area
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:30:55 at least an actual lake
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:31:07 like for god's sake it barely has a floor
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:31:29 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:31:41 HOW DO YOU FORGET TO GIVE A LAKE A FLOOR
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:32:19 alright then
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:32:30 HOW DO YOU FORGET TO GIVE A LAKE A SIDE
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:33:14 if you somehow hardcoded the terrain then this game is way past dead
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:33:49 e x a c t l y
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:34:10 the terrain is the only thing softcoded the entire game I guess
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:35:46 if I were to design a plane crazy 2.0
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:37:09 a safezone dome covering a circular 12 player pad base and a circle like map
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:38:06 small extension of the base featuring the conveyors and also some suspension tests
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:39:03 oh and also many sky islands, it is PLANE crazy so it should probably provide incentive to build PLANES
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:39:23 just small things that are fun to visit
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:39:38 ooooo
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:40:28 what if there was a loose boundary, if you go too far it becomes 0G but you are given a drag effect and helium becomes less effective
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:41:09 it stops unstable creations while presenting area for space stations
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:41:57 I like how the first about 30 minutes I am talking and we are already brainstorming a revamped plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:43:12 a fun idea is to add placeholder players for when a pvp server is emptying out
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:43:32 just a very basic ai using starter planes or starter plane like planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:44:10 yet the more collective block count active outside the safe zone the more powerful the creations
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:44:24 and crossout
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:45:00 an interesting gimmick of softcoding is you can do things like: have the entire base rotate slowly
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:46:35 and with a few simple anti floating point systems you now have a stable rotating base with no side effects and an absolute failsafe if something goes insane
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:47:10 basically so you don't get spun off and if something glitches out there can be detectors linked to the despawn button
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:47:36 yeah, there's practically 0 performance impact from the static map
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:48:50 another idea I had: spawn pad elevation, you can choose how high up your base pad is and it can have a built in conveyor to launch gliders
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:49:55 also wings need a damn good rebuild, I say that it takes double the speed for the current air resistance you get from wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:50:13 actually
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:50:18 remember gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:50:26 what if there was an air resistance slider
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:51:04 and it's likely just changing a currently existing variable
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:51:44 I am unsure if I will charge for gamepasses or if it should be free
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:52:07 but then again someone else could beat me to making it
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:53:06 knowing rick from the months I've heard of them they will probably be finished with plane crazy 1 in around 2045
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:53:19 maybe more
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:53:43 How about this
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:54:08 I start learning JS then Lua then Roblox Lua and make some small games
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:54:43 and then I ask the question "would it be fine if I made a mostly unpaid revamp of plane crazy?"
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:54:56 at no cost to the devs of course
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:56:01 that's where the make some small games comes in, first I'll start work on placing and removing blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:56:28 woah
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:57:27 I guess a version 2 is already in the works
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 15:58:44 alright, version 2 but actually may begin if the devs allow it once I complete my 30528520 factorial decades of study
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 02:19:36 ...
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 02:51:31 I still think cylinder wheel trains are good
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 02:51:38 for one reason
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 02:51:58 they can do turns on rails with 4 0.1 torque motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 02:56:30 0.01 torque does get stuck on the worst flat turn but not much else
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:00:57 seriously tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:01:04 rick, just smooth the rails better
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:01:26 don't make junctions a sharp turn
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:02:35 it only gets stuck on bad junctions
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:03:10 still could probably do it with >0.01 torque but still
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:05:25 well
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:05:48 I distrust rick with the map as it looks like the snow was manually peeled off the map
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:06:02 instead of an older version being loaded
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:08:38 for some reason servers I join empty out pretty fast
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:10:20 when and why did someone hollow the map?
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:11:10 it's not like the entire underground was made of blocks so it had to be for some non performance reason and not for appearance either
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:11:34 maybe an actual underground is being planned?
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:12:08 or did rick just get bored organizing the spaghetti and decided to disembowel the map?
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:13:27 2 axis symmetry
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:13:49 seriously tho symmetry gotta be added
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:14:07 but other than that I *manually* applied symmetry

creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:40:54 I wonder how many people will hate me if I say this
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:20 but I use rgb values that are multiples of 25
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:44:20 125 125 125 is a good light grey
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:45:21 I use them in multiples of 25 so I can choose similar yet different shades of grey/gray
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:51:14 I don't get why people are so amazed by a 1x8 wedge
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:00:05 something seems off about my wing's shape, how should I adjust it
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:01:30 hmmmmmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:02:06 I'll just add engines and see if that helps
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:17:32 this thing is looking somewhat nice
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:17:52 kind of

plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:08:49 it got less covered as they were spawning it in
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:10:03 then direct me to someone who I can send the images to
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:11:14 then direct me to someone who can give people the ability to let me send someone images of the evidence
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:12:42 then direct me to someone who can give someone the ability to give someone the ability to apply penalty for creating a lagmachine which only has image evidence
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:14:22 then direct me to someone who can hire more mods
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:47:37 Idea:
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:51:39 Lasers, they take 2 seconds to charge, can go through glass, get reflected off metal, and can only fire for 1 second and cool for 3 seconds but can chew through any non reflective non glass material
They cannot be abused as it can easily be countered by metal and a full blast only chews through 5 layers
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:52:06 it requires an advanced concentrator layout to abuse
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:52:12 also sensors would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:52:28 they could press a key for you and lets visitors press buttons and open doors
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:53:57 could be used as an auto trigger too for the laser if the laser requires a key to be held for the laser
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 07:54:43 1 use per 60 seconds maybe

plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:17:47 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:18:08 now that we are probably done shoving blocks in rickje's face

plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:19:54 want me to figure out OBS and record a video of me reading the rules right now?
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:22:42 savedata is just the best
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:23:03 there are too many save slots for a small cache
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:23:28 What if
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:23:34 what if compress data
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 08:24:14 do not trust the strange file names

plane-crazy 2020-08-17 10:24:31 ***R E A L I S M*** idea: any side of a part not attached to another one acts like a weak wing, creating drag
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 10:25:46 trailmakers designed an entire game with about 4x the features and it easily supports drag on every block
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 10:26:11 but of course the limits of roblox
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 10:31:33 this is really annoying me
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 10:31:48 just move either the ends or the bar a few pixels

creations-chat 2020-08-17 14:31:36 fun fact this now represents paint splashing against a dark structure
creations-chat 2020-08-17 14:31:51 because plane crazy sucks at shadows

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:27:40 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:27:43 Idea:
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:27:49 Quarter cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:28:01 half cylinder 2 cut in half again
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:28:21 and also quarter cylinder 2
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:28:42 half cylinder 1 cut again like half cylinder 2
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:29:30 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:29:37 but a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:30:16 and what about a quarter block?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:30:49 fine then
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:31:04 half wedge from the half block section but a triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:31:35 one moment

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:33:11 less useful idea: block to cylinder adapter
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:34:19 another less useful but very nice looking idea: half cylinder but like half wedge up but with a half block below it like half wedge from the wedge category
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:34:44 aka: cylinder support
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:35:37 
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:39:26 I really want a way to deactivate the center of mass indicator, it's just annoying to place and delete a bundle of blocks in the corner
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:39:41 sure it's a small thing but still
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:40:07 it is just linking a true false settings button to setting that thing's transparency to 1
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 22:06:02 do cameras still reset orientation when you load in something?

plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:02:35 Except the bot does not believe I read the rules
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:03:13 Idea:
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:03:27 If the role is not attached to anything important
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:03:39 just make it self assignable
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:04:05 however that would require every other role to have a higher auth than the main
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:04:25 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:04:35 shut up
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:05:35 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:05:39 as I was saying
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:06:29 244jay you are applying a broken feature as an excuse to appear powerful.
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:08:18 You are aware that in a server like this I must review 100% of content with an eye of logic so I am to make no errors in following response
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:09:03 What was said was clearly intended in multiple areas to be an insult utilizing a now inaccessible component
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:09:08 and I had handled it as such
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:09:42 And in the event you do not understand this equally unfunny joke
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:10:06 "your joke was so unfunny I missed it"
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:10:22 the end

plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:14:03 why does nobody paint stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 00:14:51 Even though I paint things every phase so even when destroyed it looks neat

creations-chat 2020-08-20 02:59:22 but hey it was made about 1-3 years ago
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:00:16 fun fact: the flying images were taken under the map because the people kept shooting at its target colored propellers

creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:45:07 3 blast radius
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:45:10 no effect
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:45:26 clearly blast radius does not use blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:46:20 so a block is 2.5 studs?
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:46:47 I'll set it to 5 and see if it actually effects the surrounding area
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:47:37 
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:47:47 2 explosives set to an increasing blast radius
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:48:21 inside the center bell detached from the surrounding things
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:49:31 testing max blast pressure in suspicion that blast pressure determines the damage on blocks as well
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:50:05 10 blast radius should affect at least one block
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:50:56 strange, so it doesn't actually unweld or break
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:51:34 then how is blast radius 10 blast pressure 2500 not doing anything to the surrounding blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:52:39 I
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:52:52 I'm just gonna use them as a decoupler for the mass
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:56:48 (facepalm)
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:56:52 I remember
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:57:05 when a creation spawns in it has about half a second of immortality
creations-chat 2020-08-20 03:57:17 I was testing them too quick
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 03:59:59 just make a sign with a +
plane-crazy 2020-08-20 04:00:32 also I am proud to announce I am in a public pvp server with no shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-20 04:22:54 so that's how the missiles are colored
help 2020-08-20 06:45:28 I have -21
creations-chat 2020-08-20 07:13:35 What sci fi thing should I put below the spinny that is powered by the spinny
creations-chat 2020-08-20 07:42:50 this will be the last time this is perfectly 2 axis symmetrical
creations-chat 2020-08-20 10:56:12 ***O R B***
creations-chat 2020-08-20 11:00:04 
creations-chat 2020-08-22 20:57:42 JESUS
creations-chat 2020-08-22 20:58:49 h o w
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:00:42 makes sense
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:00:55 is nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:09:56 I just had an idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:10:31 what if cutters functioned as wings that create drag when not moved correct
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:11:05 that will violently spin cutter bugs while everything not annoying stays the same
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:11:22 a compensation is that cutters do a lot more damage
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:11:39 that turns cutters into a repeat ramming weapon instead of a drill
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:12:03 I have another idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:12:18 BlockWing
It's literally just a thicc wing
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:12:54 combined you have deadly wings for large planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:13:05 as a cutter bug you have nothing
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:14:00 no its called allowing for a better and more compact version in pretty much every way
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:15:32 bigcrazy, while it is true I hate motor lock, I also would like not 2 block thick 2 part wings with a major weakpoint
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:15:50 instead I would like 1 block thick regular wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:16:34 2 block thick with major weakpoint
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:16:51 1
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:17:06 one side of the wing cannot be built on or attached to with motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:17:08 2
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:17:16 anything hits that motor your wing is gone
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:17:52 4 more motors creates more weight and less space while still being weak
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:25 but still
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:30 cutters with aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:36 makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:39 stops cutter bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:45 keeps most things intact
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:18:51 switches purpose of cutters
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:19:12 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:19:29 if I can make a machine with 2000 wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:21:29 then you can remove wings for all I care as long as every exposed face without a block immediately in front in reference to the direction of travel behaves as a wing
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:22:19 it's a simple check that is run once each time a 5+ block group changes direction
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:22:53 "am I behind a thing?"
If not then be aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:23:24 the check could be removed in favor of manual selection or forced on
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:23:53 and then you just have a good plane game with realistic aerodynamics and custom wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:24:15 if there was one DESIGN thing I would change
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:24:44 that would be that certain blocks appear slightly larger than their collision
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:25:11 so that the jet engines don't look like they are just magically being tacked on to a craft, etc
the-dump 2020-08-22 21:26:35 "not funny didn't laugh" is kind of a broken statement
the-dump 2020-08-22 21:26:49 memes are still funny if you think they are
the-dump 2020-08-22 21:27:05 there is a variable capacity between neutral and laughing
the-dump 2020-08-22 23:45:57 https://youtu.be/duUVKdKYmb0
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:10:20 In the event of shredder bugs I do a 5 step plan
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:10:27 1: yell at them
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:10:48 2: spawn in a rift generator
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:03 3: spawn in my least fun to destroy thing
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:26 4: do not spawn stuff
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:29 5: exit
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:42 the plan only advances a step if I get bored
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:02 or
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:04 ya know
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:12 anchored base
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:26 it takes minutes to chew through my walls
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:50 and no part of the walls will satisfy, only sting with embedded cutters
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:13:11 and then I freeze them in the wall
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:17:46 that moment when you realize you can just press c and v without ctrl
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:18:16 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:20:03 every hotkey based copy and paste in all of time uses ctrl+c and ctrl+v but of course its plane crazy, basically a car made of the worst possible materials that somehow works
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:23:45 plane crazy is basically like if someone created minecraft with roblox lua and designed it so the game can only run on one computer at a time
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:42:17 FIX THE SKY DAMMIT
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:42:31 I really want the day night cycle to work
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:42:43 and for the love of god if you guys claim this as a feature
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:43:29 but day night cycle
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:43:34 either fix it or remove it
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:43:50 "perfectly fine"
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:44:04 I set it to both and the sky disappears
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:44:11 that is not perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:45:20 thank god this time it was temporary
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:57:31 lights are too broken
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:58:15 they get sort of 'light residue' on things they pass by and all lights turn off on a join/leave
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:58:32 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:58:54 at least pulse the lights off and on whenever there's a join so I don't need to tap
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:01 11223344
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:07 every time someone joins
creations-chat 2020-08-25 04:07:08 Caution: Rather warm
creations-chat 2020-08-25 04:08:27 *Is glowing orange as vents release the product of boiling coolant*
creations-chat 2020-08-25 04:08:59 goddammit plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-25 04:09:06 god decided to turn off my lights
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:00:05 what does this do?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:00:32 people walking under it still appear to trigger the hover
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:00:51 hmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:01:06 kinda strange that the other people for those other creations are not ignored
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:05:05 gotta paint another 4 hover rings
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:05:29 for the love of god
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:06:14 if another  ***B ~ U ~ G***  I find is claimed to be a feature
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:06:49 I will personally extract the attacker's blood vessels for peeling
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:07:29 and it isn't a hovering craft
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:07:38 it's a hover motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:12:09 why is there no "start off" for smoke pipes
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:16:30 and why is there no quarter ball
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:16:42 or rather
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 20:16:47 8th ball
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:02:28 I just thought of a challenge
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:04:48 SPHERE Challenge, you must protect a 1x1 ball at all costs, the sphere must remain a maximum 25 blocks from the map, this is to prevent just putting it in a helium rocket
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:05:18 I was carefully selecting my words
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:05:26 also
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:05:40 reminder
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:06:04 though hovering may keep you away from any physical attacks
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:06:37 1: you may be pushed out of the max range and fail
2: if PVP is active bullets defeat
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:06:58 still studying
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:07:43 remember, I'm learning all of 2.5 coding languages to do this
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:08:20 yep, and the other 9 quintillion issues
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:09:09 If I were to creatively name mine
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:10:25 just "build and destroy" is a good one, not yet official decision as I just fabricated that name here and it likely belongs to somewhere else
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:10:55 you see
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:11:03 plane crazy isn't a good one either
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:11:41 I have only made 3 working planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:11:50 15 other contraptions
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:12:21 plane crazy does not properly express the full power of a building game
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:12:47 you place blocks and use them
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:13:42 the only reason I'm doing this is to show that all bugs in plane crazy can be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:14:58 well I'm angry enough to FULLY learn lua and build a new game from scratch that operates on the same basis but with actually working stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:15:15 that's the second language to learn
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:16:11 first is javascript, I'm going through simple tutorials while assembling javascript lessons, then I move to general lua, then roblox lua
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:18:39 remember that time
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:19:01 when rickje installed an entire new section to the """""secret""""" base
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:19:10 but completely ignored the bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:21:20 he had the time to script an animation for the placement ghost of conveyors but not fix bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:21:54 so basically
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:22:02 plane crazy is fucking dead.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:22:06 great
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:22:36 well then that's even more cause to remake plane crazy but with active development
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:24:39 well then, either I gotta figure out how to establish a save pipe between plane crazy and the new one or "drop your things to upgrade every aspect of the game" will occur
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:25:21 ah whatever
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:25:39 you see
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:25:56 once the base game is complete it's gonna keep improving from there
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:26:53 oo idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:28:00 and still
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:28:06 once I complete my goal
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:28:22 it is no longer plane crazy, it's gonna transform into a separate game
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:28:58 oh motor lock will not be removed, just moved into a special block
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:30:02 I'm less pissed at the side effects of the glitch, just that the glitch prevents me from locking motors properly, if I move the side effects elsewhere then bam
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:30:23 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:32:38 one of my original ideas was a survival mode, you first collect ground salvage deposits, then you build something to get to the loot filled floating islands, and so on, likely dumb but its an idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:33:20 basically plane crazy but you need to do repetitive work to build
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:33:34 yeo
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:33:36 yep
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:33:57 oh yeah, the other 2 ideas
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:34:37 1: ai vehicle slots, you can build an ai vehicle to collect for you
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:35:09 actually
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:35:48 land engineers
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:36:06 but with harvester ai
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:37:36 
creations-chat 2020-08-25 21:46:06 I am not getting sidetracked and attempting to make a  Giant Enemy ~~Spider~~ Ant
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:14:47 circles are strange in block based building games
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 22:18:50 I've been thinking about giving up on recreating plane crazy, seeing as there's already one person on it who actually has a team and mine appears to have
no reason
no logic
no work done
no team
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 22:21:52 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 22:22:31 
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 22:24:16 it's a user setting, you can choose whether or not you want to receive dms
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 16:15:12 plane crazy is one of those games you idle in for absolutely no reason and then get kicked for idle
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 16:17:49 yea no.
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 16:20:07 ...
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 16:21:22 so the game is only 97% in beta????
creations-chat 2020-08-26 17:50:56 who else thinks cutters were not made well and should be remade to prefer repeated ramming instead of sawing?
creations-chat 2020-08-26 17:51:55 the only reason shredder bugs exist is because the knife block does not behave like a knife and more like a laser drill of absolute destruction

creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:43:51 a funny counter is
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:07 for a lot of my bases
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:24 it's hard to tell when they are in build mode
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:34 so they just KTHWACK against it
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:17 question:
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:28 how good are cutters against cutters?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:36 what determines damage?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:46:12 anchored cutters?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:46:44 I have
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:47:25 A n g r y  wall
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:47:58 sadly um
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:15 angry sky not yet implemented
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:25 but blacklist can fix that
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:38 for now
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:54 I want to avoid the easy built in no melee walls
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:54:54 how strong is diamond plate?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:35 I just thought of a challenge that is completely stupid
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:45 r o u n d
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:59 you can only use blocks from the cylinder and ball category
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:59:56 it gets worse if you try to make something with interiors tho

creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:33:21 I recently learned about "***the smoke pipe glitch***" and I am unimpressed.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:33:42 it's literally just getting the smoke pipe wedged between your head and torso
creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:33:51 so more of a

creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:33:00 if I were to choose how blocks are implemented
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:33:36 you place the block in the appropriate class folder and the block holds its script
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:15 when placed it clones the block into the build area, and on launch runs the script
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:49 but
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:35:02 do ballast tanks change mass when in air
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:36:03 Idea
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:07 helium pumptank, the first block that interacts with a specific other block, it controls the power of all helium within a set radius
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:45 and why are we in creations chat?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:36 here's one of my fairly awesome ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:56 gun is a special connected block, it has 3 modes, standard, machinegun, or rifle, machinegun increases spread and decreases damage while multiplying fire rate for every gun added, rifle decreases spread, increases damage, decreases fire rate, and adds penetration for every gun added, standard has no effect for guns added
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:47 I just had another cool idea
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:00 artillery and artillery barrel
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:33 artillery fires a REALLY BIG BULLET and the barrel controls range + accuracy

general 2020-08-29 18:49:04 I'm fine with copycats, I just document them attempting to copy me (they always fail with my detailed internals) and allow them
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 18:52:04 woah
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 18:54:51 build a boat for treasure is actually almost equal in building capabilities if not greater with their pre spawn block rotation.

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 18:57:34 a grind wall
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 19:01:40 I just had an idea

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:50:53 I'm making an orbital strike satellite to obliterate all spinners

creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:11:40 painting hover thruster rings is so annoying
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:12:40 I feel like the ring should be extended to a little cutout on the back of the thruster so you can reach them without shoving your camera into the thruster
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:12:56 or better yet
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:13:10 a small hole cut into the sides so you don't need access to the back
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:26:53 I'm glad lag machine builders are incompetent. They just spam blocks but it is very easy to create a lot more lag in an organized structure.

creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:28:01 it is meant to have an entire runway sitting on top so I gotta keep the thing flat
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:28:19 but basically
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:28:46 there's the main hull zone with all the movement and gunness
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:28:53 and then there's a runway

creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:49:07 Alright here's my plan
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:49:42 I use WSAD for all torpedo steering
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:49:48 I detach one at a time
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:56:18 it appears 6 directional magnet drive will work for the air torps

creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:59:04 (forward pulls for some reason)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 21:05:51 because plane crazy dislikes my everything I will have to use horizontal rail launch torps
creations-chat 2020-08-30 21:06:13 maybe bombs can be dropped the way I intended

bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:14:26 fix rail junctions
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:16:03 there is no excuse to use copy and paste junctions where absolutely none of them have the proper connected rails to smoothly function.
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:18:09 you forgot to highlight this one where when you go around the turn and try to take the (in this case) above split, it is practically impossible to not derail
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:18:22 to clarify
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:19:14 1: go over top rail
2: take the very sharp 180 to the lower area
3: take the junction back to the top rail
4: fail horribly

general 2020-09-01 23:29:19 plane crazy has been temporarily revived.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:32:07 What the hell is this number
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:32:32 a decimal?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:33:01 clearing space
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:33:15 just to be safe
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:35:58 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:39:14 well as there is only 260k savedata atm I don
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:39:38 I don't think people can or will go to 2.5 million
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:40:40 Very unclear but ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:41:52 I wonder if there is a limit to how much savedata can be put in to a single save
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:43:43 gives me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:44:31 a COMPRESS button for the absolutely desperate, basically renders the craft useless and unpainted, but smaller
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:45:56 it takes clusters of 1x1s and turns them into unpainted beams if you have enough beams that is, also if you select extreme compression it also removes all high save data parts.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:46:39 that no gives me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:47:26 why not just find some good devs and just add in a better compression system
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:47:41 basically just
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:47:46 creation.zip
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:48:28 idea: you are just being toxic
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:49:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:50:04 seriously, I mean sure finding and removing clusters is resource intensive but it's better than soft banning people who aren't in the discord
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:53:35 > 4. new devs is a very bad idea since  madattak once said "rick's coding is so hard to understand that only rick understands it"
<@!221487880487436288> THEN WHY IS RICKJE REQUESTING FOR MORE DEVS TO TAKE OVER
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:54:16 but you see
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:54:30 code is *in* scripts
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:54:40 if you can't read the code you can't read the scripts
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:55:36 I wonder how the save is rendered useless at that point
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:56:00 does it just deny saving? remove random blocks on restart?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:56:21 yay
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:56:47 rickje was smart
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:56:54 I am happy now
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:57:20 convert that to TB
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:57:31 actually I will
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:57:44 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:58:08 I wonder how many copies of that I can fit on my 8TB external
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:58:16 also awwww
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:58:31 corgi has a lil corgi boat
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:59:43 I did the math and
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:00:01 200 copies of that savedata fit in just one external drive
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:00:55 that drive cost around $100, even if the game suddenly became super popular it would be very easy to contain that savedata
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:02:07 a safe way to handle it would be 2 independent drives each holding a copy
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:02:36 lemme do the math for how many people filling that limit entirely could fit on the 2 drives
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:03:30 
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:03:57 4 million bytes per person
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:04:43 when the converter goes into scientific notation I think you have enough for a lot of people
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:05:05 desciencing that number
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:07:21 800,000,000,000
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:07:24 bytes
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:07:32 compressing down to per person
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:10:11 it can hold 20x the inrush of players you stated on just one drive
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:10:20 a second drive for safety
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:10:35 2 more drives and you double that number
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:11:16 for only $400 you can satisfy 400000 machines that cost a lot more
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:11:32 unless I messed up a little
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:11:52 in which case just leave it to wherever the data is supposed to be sent
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:12:47 In the event that datastorage IS sent to the computer that creates it then there is literally no problem
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:13:52 I'm going through every possible place the data could be sent to as FUN FACT: I don't know where!
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:14:40 so basically
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:14:54 it gets piped to the drive
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:15:53 then I'm now going to try my best to see how much capacity those servers be gotted
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:16:35 well
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:16:42 servers aint a magic fix all
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:17:14 but they very much should have the space to hold what they are built
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:17:18 to hold
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:17:48 fine then, how about a recap
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:18:42 someone was concerned about how much data is in the savedata
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:18:51 and with a lot of people playing
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:19:31 that was found to be about 40gb for 10k people filling the thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:19:35 no big deal
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:19:37 end of story
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:20:43 savedata is not an 8tb file per 10k people so we fine
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:20:52 good
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:20:55 have a nice day
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:21:29 you see
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:21:56 savedata is not some magical magic energy that takes up no space in reality
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:22:12 but that space was found to be very very small
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:22:17 end of story
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:22:58 if you somehow do not understand after I've rephrased it about 6 times then how are you making computers
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:23:31 goddammit
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:23:55 preparing multi sectioned breakdown of everything I've been talking about, be prepared for an essay
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:24:48 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:26:10 fine then, I'll stick to the 1 paragraph
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:27:29 The negative impacts of savedata on roblox server storage capacity
There's none.
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:29:10 Born in the USA and I've been living here for quite some time, you are the only person I've ever come across who has freaked out so hard over me trying to speak casually
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:30:49 I've been explaining to expired for
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:30:55 about 15 minutes now
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:31:00 from start to end
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:31:30 To conclude
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:32:04 this entire thing could have been explained by letting me make a conclusion about 15 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:32:34 all of my work for this 15 minutes has been pointless as the topic has absolutely no impact in any way
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:33:28 I thought you made the inference that since I could see this I was in the server
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:34:17 and yes that is a picture of me liking a picture of you submitting a picture of a sandcrawler
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:35:59 purified
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:36:11 that was an image of me upvoting someone else's thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:36:33 also this is my latest craft I've been working on
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:37:30 and then I stabbed it and reminded you that this thing is gonna get a roof in probably 2073
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:39:37 
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:40:05 a bit of a narrow runway but a runway indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:40:29 sadly plane crazy removed the save file but I have old images
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:41:31 the head kept pinging into the void because of motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:43:29 Here's the currently gone mech from a rather bad camera angle
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:44:12 and here's the new base from an equally bad camera angle

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:47:11 I'm just generally good at freestyle
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:47:54 
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:02 I usually just take an element
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:05 focus on that
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:09 and build around it
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:25 the old mech stemmed from another missing turret
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:39 it still has the cabs of the old turret
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:48:55 the other thing that stemmed from it was
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:49:25 this thing which kept the cab as well
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:49:55 remember when I entombed you in blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:52:06 oh also the mech integrated the turret base into a wheel thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:52:26 the octocopter into the arms
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:52:53 both preserved the large rapid fire cannon aspect
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:54:17 returning to constructing the flying version of the still very incomplete base
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 00:59:29 ...

creations-chat 2020-09-02 01:45:16 accidentally saved over my base, luckily undo decided to function

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 23:58:40 I wonder how many people don't know you can scroll sideways to reveal more saves
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 00:00:42 it would probably be a lot clearer to have a page based system
the-dump 2020-09-03 06:19:41 lmao the very fast disappearing gif has a broken access denied page
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 06:20:53 HOW DID Y-
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 06:21:01 HOW
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 06:21:17 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:23:47 Through the power of "Why not?" I will make a very low res map
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:24:00 3D recreation of the world
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:24:37 paint block might actually be useful.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:27:50 is this a large enough thing to accurately display most details?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:28:10 actually I'll push it to the build edges and just crop if needed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:39:38 Like a chessboard, only that it cannot function
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:40:23 Anybody got a clear image of the whole plane crazy world?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:40:35 actually I'll just take my own
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:50:11 Map (2 Complications)
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:50:28 1: Area covered by drone
Area covered by drone is just grass
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:51:07 2: Camera cannot point straight down
Camera angle is acceptably close to straight down

creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:58:39 Blue as always but this time it will highlight where I have taken damage
creations-chat 2020-09-03 06:59:44 I feel like once this one is complete I will make another that is completely 3D
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:00:51 or one that is multiple layers that can be peeled back
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:00:55 aka: book
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 07:08:23 Game jus- game... no.
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 07:08:31 game that is incorrect
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:11:27 Is this a good grass color?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:11:56 I know there is a grass material but I wanna avoid materials to keep a  *c l e a n™️*  design
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:14:22 cool
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:15:27 I use this for grass, I like to keep to multiples of 25, helps with knowing how much you will adjust the color
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:16:02 Not that far off
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:21:12 How many blocks wide is the build plot?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:21:35 ok
help 2020-09-03 07:35:36 I've got a 58x58 map (half block border reduces by 1 block) and I need to determine how many blocks should make up that cutout in the bottom left
help 2020-09-03 07:39:28 Ah screw it
help 2020-09-03 07:39:52 as the map is divided into a 7x7 group of grids I
help 2020-09-03 07:40:26 I will round to the pixel groups
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:41:48 Dammit plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:45:28 What's the color of this dirt?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:46:22 I'm gonna plop a second layer onto the thing
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:47:53 I will run this image through a pixilation system down to 1x1 and grab the RGB of that
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:51:40 Here's the pixelated
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:52:12 I selected a specific area but that shouldn't do anything to the next tool
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:54:43 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:55:40 this seems acceptable.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:00:47 it's not very close because the actual thing looks like baby vomit
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:05:25 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:05:40 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:06:06 it appears I must crop into rectangle
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:09:26 what is this color?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:10:39 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:10:55 I'll use leftmost for conveyor pad
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:12:18 this isn't gonna be a true 3D map
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:12:25 it's a topographical by color
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:12:34 darker=lower
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:12:43 different colors=different things tho
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:17:34 something cool I wish existed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:17:40 programmable motor
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:17:59 when its key is pressed the thing goes through a set series of rotations
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:18:14 perfect for an actual mech
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:25:03 why no push
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:25:06 also
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:25:21 WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:26:01 who spilled about 4 gallons of blue paint on that guy's server?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:26:25 also
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:26:38 the conveyors were on 2.5 speed toggled on
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:27:33 what the
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:27:49 it's only working about half the time and on random conveyors
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:42:48 I wanna continue this glass pattern but I don't want to have a 2 million block count and lose my hand
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:43:57 I'll save the pattern for the water later on
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:49:18 this basically equally overcomplicated one will work
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:51:17 I'm gonna place the blocks with each new block placed being 5 value brighter
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:55:21 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:55:29 this is the pattern of EACH panel
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:55:39 and 7x7
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:55:48 grid of them is
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:55:54 a lot
bug-reports 2020-09-03 09:05:04 The filter on signs can be bypassed by cropping letters off of the sign
example
AF = ##
AFK = AFK
AF made by pushing K off = AF
general 2020-09-04 07:00:39 just thought about something
general 2020-09-04 07:01:08 it would be cool if there was a mouse designed so you could set how many clicks per click occurred
general 2020-09-04 07:01:26 I need to click exactly 7 times per tile to remove it
help 2020-09-04 07:55:02 this pin contradicts the closed state of the reports chat
help 2020-09-04 07:55:12 where can I report a person
help 2020-09-04 07:58:57 you see
help 2020-09-04 07:59:03 if there is nowhere to report
help 2020-09-04 07:59:12 then people who should be reported
help 2020-09-04 07:59:15 cannot be reported
help 2020-09-04 08:02:45 that's like
help 2020-09-04 08:03:56 if
"stop bullying, speak up"
was suddenly replaced by
"we don't care about you and assistance is not available because nobody wants to be helpful, die"
help 2020-09-04 08:04:48 like bruh
help 2020-09-04 08:05:10 rickje doesn't want to hire new mods but the mods already here don't feel like being mods
help 2020-09-04 08:05:37 I guess the game will die not by bugs but lack of moderation
help 2020-09-04 08:06:08 so basically
help 2020-09-04 08:07:05 "we won't do anything to try to fix the obvious problem so you need to keep switching servers every 10 seconds"
help 2020-09-04 08:08:54 Let's count the problems with the players that could be fixed with base level moderation and balance patches
cutter bugs
non pvp spinners
generic trolls
unreported exploiters
help 2020-09-04 08:10:18 shredder bugs are basically the #1 kill everything solution right now, if cutters were simply rebalanced then actually creative things could exist
help 2020-09-04 08:12:30 also
why the hell does this game even consider allowing exploiters? it's directly against the roblox TOS to the point that there's a specifically crafted option in the roblox report system
help 2020-09-04 08:13:45 
help 2020-09-04 08:13:57 
help 2020-09-04 08:14:08 the problem without a solution
help 2020-09-04 08:15:20 literally forced moderation into a knot where the only clear way to fix it is to convince rickje to trust moderators

creations-chat 2020-09-04 08:41:09 I can't decide
creations-chat 2020-09-04 08:41:18 should it be motors or disconnectors
creations-chat 2020-09-04 08:41:39 bruh
creations-chat 2020-09-04 08:41:51 s w i n g  or  AAA
help 2020-09-04 08:44:49 If the response to an exploiter being in the server is to just move somewhere else
help 2020-09-04 08:44:58 instead of handling them
help 2020-09-04 08:45:11 that is considered allowing them to be not dealt with
help 2020-09-04 08:47:11 though today I haven't met one about 15 minutes ago someone uploaded a vid of someone using fly exploit to move a wall at incredible speed
help 2020-09-04 08:47:37 I hope they grabbed the username of the exploiter

general 2020-09-04 20:07:39 Here's my 2 ideas
general 2020-09-04 20:07:42 3*
general 2020-09-04 20:08:10 1: Hardcoded stuff fails to catch up with modern roblox
general 2020-09-04 20:08:29 2: The community gets infested
general 2020-09-04 20:08:48 3: The game gets abandoned
general 2020-09-04 20:09:14 at least there is more savedata now
general 2020-09-04 21:33:29 FTD really looks like PC
general 2020-09-04 21:34:44 as I said
general 2020-09-04 21:34:46 like
general 2020-09-04 21:34:55 not very similar or identical
general 2020-09-04 21:35:09 it's quite the stretch to drop the quality down to PC

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:57:43 Something nice that probably will never happen: Logic gates, they just emulate keys if certain keys are on or off, allowing easy connection and use
the-dump 2020-09-05 11:00:16 should've added bulletproof glass to the sides so the cardboard can't be cut out from the side and so the grinder can't be dismantled and reassembled through the hole
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:01:31 why can't I make ice material stand out more
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:02:43 things I want in the game:
Wedges
Drag block
Logic gates that function via key emulation
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:04:13 oh and anti  __***V o i d ™️***__  helium protection
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:05:02 maybe all forms of propulsion and wing effects start to die at the end of the altitude meter
general 2020-09-05 11:10:32 Scammer
general 2020-09-05 11:10:52 sends an adopt me copycat link every day
general 2020-09-05 11:11:02 they keep getting taken down but more ones are created
general 2020-09-05 11:11:15 
general 2020-09-05 11:12:00 I'll report the place again and unfriend them
general 2020-09-05 11:12:26 you can tell it's a scam because the place has a 1 player max, perfect for a teleport
general 2020-09-05 11:12:45 or a fake game designed to have those dumb bots
general 2020-09-05 11:13:45 investigating the creator
general 2020-09-05 11:19:18 Is this good? I want to convey the fact that you are not allowed to copy a game that is effectively roblox's money printer.
general 2020-09-05 11:22:37 Roblox u ok?
general 2020-09-05 11:22:55 just shove everything into the left 2/3 of the screen
general 2020-09-05 11:23:57 I have 0 because I have no need to get any
general 2020-09-05 11:24:20 I focus more on what I can do without spending money
general 2020-09-05 11:25:16 If a game is locked behind a paywall to the point that they deny first impressions just don't play
general 2020-09-05 11:26:00 If a game prevents progress without spending money just don't progress, instead find something else to progress in
general 2020-09-05 11:26:53 I'm glad the extra save slots and savedata are not locked behind a paywall, that would've destroyed the entire game the instant the update comes out
general 2020-09-05 11:32:44 To conclude, I try to ensure everyone in my house has the most fun, I'm not gonna run off draining money from my parents taking away from what they can do just because I want to skip effort.
Ask yourself this: "What other things could be done with this money?"
general 2020-09-05 11:33:31 and yes I may sound like mr crabs with how stingy I am with money but with reason
general 2020-09-05 11:33:51 correct
general 2020-09-05 11:35:22 that way those who never even received access to such a material can live the best of what they can still do
general 2020-09-05 11:36:34 as I am in quarantine however, I do not encounter as many chances to donate with my allowance.
general 2020-09-05 11:36:47 so now I'm here
general 2020-09-05 11:37:09 Have fun everyone.
general 2020-09-05 11:39:26 who else thinks that the lego age restriction should be moved from X-99 to X-150
general 2020-09-05 11:42:15 I wonder
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:43:13 I wonder
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:43:36 if there was a poll created on various suggested things
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:43:43 placed in every roblox server

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:44:30 you see
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:44:47 the reason I dislike motor lock is the side effects
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:45:03 ex: ruining my non helium mech
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 11:45:15 by randomly deleting the head

creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:02:43 gotta find a solution to the bombs falling weirdly
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:23:22 it appears the motion of the craft will be enough to knock the bombs loose if they jam like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:56:23 What I do when making a turret
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:56:41 there's 2 joints I like that nobody uses for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:57:21 1: just the base forms a Y shape covering the joint and connects to it via that Y shape
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:57:59 2: an l shape with either dual barrel cannon or the turret sort of exists around the joint
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:58:11 and there is 3 but it's just stupid
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:58:22 a Y shape guarding the l shape
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:59:02 if only there was a sensor block...
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 16:59:22 just that and you already have logic gates and the potential to make an automated craft
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:11:14 why is motors like <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:11:37 and not
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:13:34 But
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:19:28 but
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:19:33 <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:19:36 how spinn
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:19:55 ...
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:20:01 🇰
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:20:40 I'm just gonna pretend its a motor in a square housing spinning a metal plate
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:21:00 JESUS
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:21:36 how are there so many people without catastrophic implosion of screech?
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 22:21:53 cool

general 2020-09-06 20:13:50 yay
general 2020-09-06 20:13:59 now I can finally run minesweeper
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:25:14 I can make a fortress but not a plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:25:24 I can make a flying fortress but not a plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:25:44 And how many fucking times do I have to tell you
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:26:05 I am angry because motor lock broke my 4000 block mech
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:26:24 currently angrier because plane crazy deleted it
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:26:29 just shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:27:05 just shut up
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:27:47 I'm just gonna log all the unjustified hatred towards me and move on

plane-crazy 2020-09-07 11:29:51 Cya
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:21:30 Show me which ones you claim "shitty"
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:22:54 This plane is likely for the droop snoot concept and the default paint color is similar to that of most planes
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:23:27 This mech is far superior to my now missing mech
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:24:21 Painting things is difficult
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:25:09 This one... is questionable, it appears unfinished.
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:25:17 but still well made
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:25:38 Just noticed the propeller propeller and yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:26:56 but I wouldn't call it "shitty" unless it was made in such a way that every part is far below acceptable
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:29:08 wouldn't this line connect to the tail stopping spinnage?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:30:14 Troubleshooting disconnectors:
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:30:42 1: are both sides connected through other parts?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:30:58 2: is there an anchor block active set to non physics?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:31:30 1:
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:31:53 ex: if you had a ring shape with a disconnector on it
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:32:08 that ring shape needs either-
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:32:18 
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:33:00 that ring shape needs either a second disconnector or a break somewhere else
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:33:34 otherwise when the disconnector activates the 2 halves are still connected through a different point
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:47:53 This probably sounds like I hate motorlock for existing but actually I just have never found the need to use the <:IntendedFeatureX:706289545250996235>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:48:34 it's quite fun to avoid using the thing, it gives a clean feel
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:49:17 also it's fun to watch y'all have an aneurism over me being fine without it
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:51:02 it appears I'm not allowed to search
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:51:32 bruh
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:53:47 s m o o t h
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:54:48 Now watch someone run over and try to complain that my work is bad because it doesn't use something
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:57:09 My least smooth build
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:57:23 actually I had 2 less smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:57:33 3
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:58:26 1: tutorial plane
2: tutorial plane but big and encased in wedge
3: literally just a cube
creations-chat 2020-09-07 19:59:07 Here's a list of shades and how I perceive them
creations-chat 2020-09-07 20:01:37 150 150 150 - Very light gray
125 125 125 - Light light gray
100 100 100 - Light gray / Gray
75 75 75 - Gray / Dark gray
50 50 50 - Dark gray
25 25 25 - Very dark gray
0 0 0 - Black

gray may be substituted with grey but idc I use both
creations-chat 2020-09-07 20:02:07 I use multiples of 25 for a more snapped to grid color select
creations-chat 2020-09-07 20:03:34 I'mma make a color table with a range between 250 and 0 with increment of 10
creations-chat 2020-09-07 20:04:35 fun fact: I haven't started roblox until this point, I've just been grabbing images off the server
creations-chat 2020-09-07 20:09:01 What's a better cylinder turn? Pontoons or Round wedge out?
general 2020-09-07 20:16:00 Why was the turbojet briefly in the members count voice chat?
the-dump 2020-09-07 20:29:01 Arcor Strawberry Bon Bons
the-dump 2020-09-07 20:29:15 no
the-dump 2020-09-07 20:29:30 
the-dump 2020-09-07 20:31:08 I detect Tanya Degurechaff in the background, correct?
the-dump 2020-09-07 20:31:24 I approve
general 2020-09-07 20:40:27 but you see
general 2020-09-07 20:40:34 guns on a boat are cool
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:52:35 I wonder
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:52:44 what is the speed of an ingame bullet?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:53:28 Is that speed relative to the vehicle or does something going 505 go faster than the bullets it fires?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:54:43 If it is relative to the vehicle firing then
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:55:32 something going faster than a bullet can defeat any stationary device firing at its back
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:56:57 Something cool: Laser designator, it can force override the seeking property of seeking missiles, for balancing it can only do one at a time
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:58:14 Missiles fired at the same time it will pick the closest launcher
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:58:32 if one is fired and then another it will switch to controlling the last fired
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:59:19 If last fired explodes before one fired before it the designator switches to the last fired still active
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:59:58 Another cool thing: Missile customization
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:00:12 a bunch of snap together launcher parts
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:00:54 ones that are larger take longer to accelerate and may even fail to launch, flopping back onto the launcher
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:01:23 this presents a ratio of warheads to sensors to fuel
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:02:19 have something see past all defenses but run out of fuel instantly, have something go through all defenses and travel to the enemy but only have a firecracker as an explosive
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:02:45 have something be a long range nuke but be stopped by any defense
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:03:39 It gives flares a good defense purpose by making heat seeking missiles target their cloud, the missile still prioritizes super rockets over flares though
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:05:41 defense missiles, they produce a stronger presence than the plane to a specific detector system but are heavy and do no damage to craft, interceptor missiles can work but are VERY heavy and have a specific engagement range
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:06:04 All this combined completely remasters a major component in all combat
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:07:03 also, here's something that doesn't end cutter bugs but OUTPREFORMS cutter bugs
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:07:51 manual guide missiles, they are controlled one at a time with any payload
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:08:14 here's some payload ideas
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:08:20 explosive - bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:08:44 kinetic - basically a weight with a thruster
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:09:13 javelin - basically sticks a thruster on the enemy
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:09:34 grapple - YOU ARE COMING WITH ME SIR
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:10:02 they require a specific set of conditions
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:10:16 1: they are heavy as hell and travel slow
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:10:26 2: cannot be manually guided
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:10:51 3: if the rope is tugged on basically at all the thing snaps permanently destroying the launcher
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:11:51 this means you must create something that can match speed and agility almost flawlessly and trust that the enemy doesn't dodge
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:11:54 also
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:12:01 by cannot be manually guided
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:12:06 I mean cannot be guided
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:12:14 they are an arcing projectile
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:12:56 but if you are speed synced like that and unable to dodge then there's a lot worse things that could be used
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:13:27 yep
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:13:49 they are more of a fun pirate ship thing for basically roleplay
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:14:59 Cutters need a rebalance, they need to do more damage when moved correctly and no damage incorrectly
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:15:39 I mean it would stop very bad drills
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:16:22 also we gotta be real here
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:16:32 these are metal knives trying to cut metal
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:17:09 they should be based more on how much inertia sits behind the blade and how much resistance to the pressure the enemy applies
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:17:48 I mean the material literally blends in with the default block so probably the same material on the same material
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:19:30 I mean yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:20:37 something moving 1000x the speed of the target with a cutter in front is gonna break some blocks, probably about 7-14 blocks deep
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:21:02 but if it is 2 blocks wide that becomes
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:21:18 3.5-7 blocks deep
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:21:44 4 cutters and its 1.75-3.5
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:22:20 but if you look at all sides of the cutter except the front
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:22:27 it's a flat surface
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:22:44 that should do equal damage as a block moving at the same speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:23:22 which currently is no damage at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:23:59 Most drill cutterbugs use forwards facing cutters spinning
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 22:24:25 they spin in the direction of a flat surface
creations-chat 2020-09-07 22:40:12 I'm gonna try and fail to  build a boat
creations-chat 2020-09-07 22:40:14 it
creations-chat 2020-09-07 22:40:33 it's probably gonna become some floating box of garbage
creations-chat 2020-09-07 22:50:37 Not very boat hull but at least there's a lot of space
creations-chat 2020-09-07 23:04:03 Petition to allow custom default block placement color
creations-chat 2020-09-07 23:17:58 as you can see I said screw conventional boats and have switched to a more special type of boat
creations-chat 2020-09-08 00:00:48 The best way to travel

creations-chat 2020-09-08 12:14:32 Tip: F12 starts an ingame recording, it's low quality but then if you run it through streamable and paste the link somewhere you have a video
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:17:10 I kinda want to download to see how my antivirus and 43 others handle it
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:19:59 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:20:59 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:52:26 Something I want: half wing + half delta wing + flush wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:53:29 A: half wing, it's just a wing but rectangle shaped
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:54:38 B: half delta wing (1 and 2), it's like the half wedge down from half blocks and half wedge from wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:55:34 C: flush wing, it's a wing but one side can smoothly connect to blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:56:28 as in, take the thin part of the wing and remove half from one side only
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:56:39 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:57:38 can't post WIPs in creations and the only finished thing I have got 4 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>  3 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:58:23 🇫
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:59:03 imagine posting WIPs in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 12:59:53 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:00:32 it appears unfinished and they claim it "experimental"
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:02:43 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:03:20 yep
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:04:18 Imagine being in direct violation of the rules in hopes of receiving access to things.
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:05:29 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:06:10 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:06:23 let's get some warnings goin
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:06:58 I'll stop flooding this chat
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:07:20 just search `in: creations` WIP
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:08:25 pov: some person who yells at people wanting to help enforce frequently broken rules
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:14:31 I wonder how many ranked people have WIPs in creations
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:14:53 
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:15:14 just picking names and searching
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:16:57 I wonder how many manually deleted their WIPs
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:18:57 you can delete things you upload in creations, I wonder how many unfinished submissions were deleted by their owner
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:21:22 just helping out by finding WIPs (I was bored anyways and wanted to find something using search tool)
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:22:36 Because y'all keep hatin on me so I gotta find something to do to make myself useful
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:24:07 as you should've figured out by now
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:24:51 I'm trying to latch on to something to apply counterargument, when someone picks an argument with me for no reason I'm gonna make sure it's a fight
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:25:32 that's like punishing a student for fighting back against bullying
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:25:50 I'm trying to apply counterargument by any means
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:26:17 well last I checked
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:26:42 utilizing my lack of rank as a point of me being less than anyone else is quite a problem
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:28:35 and now I will cease my fueling of this as it appears people have stopped making fun of me being unranked and I dislike being warned for trying to balance arguments
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:30:13 you see "Imagine being unranked" followed by a response of what appears to be laughing emoji is quite the effective way to piss me off
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:31:29 example: you have convinced me to restart this until you guys realize it is not ok to make fun of me without justification
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:32:14 spinn
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:34:01 it's better than my chonk plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 13:34:45 takes 4 huge thrusters to take off, no clue why because it can fly with just one
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:44:23 Probably a recording of the piloting of a pvp missile
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:44:48 goddamn things hold the second place on least fun pvp things
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:45:10 idea:
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:45:37 explosives set to on impact and are armed should instantly explode if shot
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:46:11 then
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:46:14 idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:46:43 explosives shot twice will be rendered nonfunctional
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:47:44 idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:48:11 explosives are heavy if blast pressure is set high
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:48:55 I present an alternative
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:49:11 FIELD GENERATOR AND FIELD BLOCK
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:51:20 I'm gonna keep brainstorming solutions to permanently rebalance missiles and cutterbugs because I've decided to dedicate myself to finding the most compact destroyer of them
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:52:04 aka
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:52:11 "Run away from your problems"
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:52:29 then
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:52:48 find a solution of how to make a static base move 10k sps while remaining in place
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:53:44 I present a cheap patch solution in the form of a new block
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:55:24 Field generator, makes a plot sized bubble of which distributes all external damage to the generator, half damage fired internally is distributed to the generator
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:55:38 the generator is anchored at all times
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:55:45 or
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:55:48 not all times
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:56:07 but it needs to be going under 5 sps to activate and anchors when running
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:56:37 can only activate on plot or off the base pad
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:57:02 then I present solution 2
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:57:18 literally make a black hole creation
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:58:38 Providing rebalance info
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 15:58:57 Static and dynamic field generators
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:04:42 Static field generator
Can only activate 100 blocks from the base pad
Produces a spherical field that scales damage rate with size, larger field means faster deterioration.
When active the field damages the blocks inside at slow but exponentially increasing pace, providing immunity to all external damage except EMP explosives that force switch the device off, if the device remains on for one minute it implodes killing the owner regardless of location
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:05:08 a plot size field can only stay active for 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:05:24 also takes 15 seconds to activate
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:05:38 shut I'm making cool things
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:05:59 so I put stuff here anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:06:51 Pretty sure there isn't any rules against suggesting outside of suggestions but I'll double check
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:07:43 Sooo many people break this one towards me
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:08:27 People twist my words to sound like I hate motor lock because it sucks or something
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:09:07 someone else though
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:09:12 this server
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:09:46 or rather it's me being pissed because y'all harass me
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:10:59 I'm tired of this shit where some guys go "ImAgInE NoT BeInG RaNkEd" and proceed to make fun of me
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:12:41 I complain here because I need to vent because of those people
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 16:13:20 I swear to fucking god I am done with this shit

Goodbye

If the button set as forwards or backwards for a locked and compressed motor is activated, the motor expands, if all motors expand at once, things may happen

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 07:43:16 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 07:53:33 I think flat looks best, it has its own reasonably small waves

plane-crazy 2020-11-01 01:32:57 What setting on a piston is "extend 1 block"
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 01:33:15 2 is not a full block
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 01:34:23 Cool
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 01:37:38 Half piston is not a half block and I am angry
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:01:58 For some reason 1.13 isn't a distance supported by this input box
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:02:10 just moves to 1.12
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:02:50 try setting a piston's distance to 1.13
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:03:08 and click out of the input box
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:12:03 
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 02:12:23 ignore self makes the ball not detonate when it slaps something in the cannon

plane-crazy 2020-11-02 06:14:02 How
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 06:14:38 Idea that I can't suggest because

plane-crazy 2020-11-02 06:25:02 Idea I can't suggest: Ball Joint, any block connected is attached to a ball joint centered at the middle of the ball joint block
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 06:29:41 Why not just
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 06:30:03

creations-chat 2020-11-03 18:14:38 It seems odd to discuss only things in <#384025409945337856>, I predict this will intensify the amount of things flooding <#384025409945337856>.
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 18:15:54 Well this is pretty much what the creations chat used to be so yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-03 18:18:27 This chat has become a direct extension of <#384025409945337856> and I predict this change will negatively impact <#384025409945337856> by adding a pointer instructing people to first post stuff there and then talk about it here
creations-chat 2020-11-03 18:23:29 This reminds me of the no simping rule in QSERF main
bug-reports 2020-11-03 19:20:03 report "InkHeads" to roblox and make it moderately emotional mentioning things like how hundreds of kids play games like this and such.
bug-reports 2020-11-03 19:20:52 They seem to listen to reports better if it describes the problem rather than just "bot" or "filter"

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:48:40 Let's check for errors
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:49:54 SUGGESTION: Add a block that recreates what motor lock did and keep the motors as they are
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:51:18 Motor lock has been walking a fine line as it was never truly implemented, any bug or patch from roblox could've easily killed motor lock at any time and today is the day
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:52:12 madattak is online, contact them
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:53:18 The era of block compression has been terminated by an unknown system, network, group, or other cause
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:54:21 On the bright side this will destroy a lot of the cutterbugs of recent years
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:56:09 Motor lock died for unknown reasons, continued drama will result in mutes, continue onwards
Hey, at least motor lock can be used properly now.
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:03:19 like
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:04:21 you have motor lock, compact but mildly rough, and then there's designs like mine that stick to grid
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:05:53 then leave, rickje is likely to not patch this as said, plane crazy is hardcoded

It took a month or more for a practically unusable shape
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:33:37 One of the many beneficial bugs, very stretched blocks can leave the build box
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:34:51 Also, I still don't see why there's a need for a vertical cap, maybe just because the game is old and uses an outdated save system?
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:35:08 Build a boat for treasure has a very tall build box
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:36:16 It's the only area to expand without a lot of change to the positioning of every spawn position
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:37:43 Plus it presents a lot more opportunity, ex: cutting folds out of a creation by building it vertically, or adding more folds
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:38:57 Conclusion: though it would be better to expand the build space in the arrow decal's direction, if it comes to expanding the pad, it's likely height will increase first
general 2020-11-04 01:40:15 Alright, who the fuck decided it was ok to kill minecraft cats
bug-reports 2020-11-04 01:45:47 If plane crazy didn't destroy my mech it'd have a wonderful day and its body would stop viciously dismembering itself
bug-reports 2020-11-04 01:46:17 Explain how corrupting a save file is not plane crazy's fault
bug-reports 2020-11-04 01:46:59 but the mech relied on the original function of motor lock, to ensure the joints didn't slide all over the place
bug-reports 2020-11-04 01:47:26 and now it'd be nice as it would be working perfectly

plane-crazy 2020-11-05 13:17:28 well it would break game things but it also might break a few creations where the builder didn't unpower motor lock or used the sudden decompression of motor lock as a spring

plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:17:42 Thereby creating a Vip1 meaning that for any Vip to exist > 1 then there needs to be a Vip1
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:19:37 My favorite thing to do with arguments is link both sides together
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:20:03 Usually leads to "If your side of the argument is true then it is false and mine is true"
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:20:38 I will now introduce the mechanics of good game design
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:21:22 In a game where you are not spoon fed information by the second it is required to build this information into the environment.
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:21:43 Lacking this structure will leave players confused
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:22:51 In the instance that a value greater than 1 is attached to the end of an item's name it is typically considered to be a marker that the item is part of a list usually starting with 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:23:28 with this assumption the player psychologically constructs a 'phantom' vip 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:24:18 For Vip2 to exist while Vip1 does not exist results in the player assuming there is a Vip1 and constructing an image of it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:25:11 And now we hit recursion, to simply increment to Vip3 chains down to Vip2 which chains down to Vip1
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:25:49 The existence of Vip0 would confuse players and likely result in a link to Vip1 and such for negatives
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 08:27:02 This concludes my deconstruction of an argument to the atomic level and reassembling into a recursive chain to test the strategy, continue doing plane stuff

general 2020-11-11 23:55:47 Because people seem to believe <#495286269459300364> is for chains I'm gonna need a new place to put memes
general 2020-11-11 23:56:48 Are you sure you want everyone who does not want to deal with that chain to fill general with stuff
general 2020-11-11 23:58:11 By obstructing the pressure relief for meme generation, a leak can and will form somewhere else
general 2020-11-11 23:59:17 Categorizing today's meme list by closest matching chat excluding <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-11-12 00:01:36 On the grounds that the content of this post may be associated with <#384021699466756107>, it walks the fine line of meme or not meme, I will push it to the non meme side by utilizing it as a reference for a creation to work on.
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 00:03:13 To ensure I am well within the lines of not being a meme, I've decontextualized this image and will recontextualize it as a reference image, this is not a meme.
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 00:03:26 I am to attempt to craft this shape
general 2020-11-12 00:04:29 Update: Due to the collapse of the chain I will recontextualize the image and move it to <#495286269459300364>

the-dump 2020-11-12 00:06:18 
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:07:33 Due to recent interruption the meme list was reconfigured, before undoing these changes I will install a small statement
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:12:08 In the event <#495286269459300364> is obstructed by a chain of which erases unrelated messages, we are physically unable to keep posts in <#495286269459300364>, this presents a very sensitive situation of which adds slack to the line of rule 4 of which, if utilized correctly, may completely dismantle the points of rule 4.
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:12:42 The loophole in this situation is how
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:07 We are instructed to move a material to a location
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:23 if that location is unavailable, we cannot follow that instruction
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:41 this instruction is tied to the entirety of the no memes rule
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:14:40 if manipulated correctly it may completely dissolve rule 4 whenever an appropriate message is deleted from <#495286269459300364>
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:15:36 Suggested action: Introduce a second dump chat, as a chain cannot bridge between chats this will completely seal the loophole
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:16:24 I'm discussing how if that chain continued for longer I may have stumbled upon a loop hole that allowed everyone to put things similar to memes everywhere

the-dump 2020-11-12 19:20:38 I'm gonna make a little note in my server to never play a single video ever sent by you again.
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:22:39 Anybody got suggestions for audio limiting software? I'm going to continue to be pissed for the next hour because my ears are ringing
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:27:00 You see, if someone decides to post earrape and I am a person with a mild case of tinnitus in such a way that it rings for hours if I hear a loud noise, should I be angry?
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:32:03 I wonder if no excessively loud videos is a part of the common sense rule
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:32:53 Like seriously
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:33:16 I'm gonna make a request to discord to have an audio peak warning if a video peaks above a set db value
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:34:34 You say that like the mp4 wasn't modified to have max volume reguardless at the scream area
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:35:50 Yeah, nobody enjoys them, even the sender just gets "hehe i annoyed peoples"
the-dump 2020-11-12 19:36:39 That's because it has effort

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:10:27 Then go faster than it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:11:54 Solution: Blacklist
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:13:25 Idea V2: Just yeet it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:13:57 An explosives shotgun should both obliterate the cutters and disintegrate the motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:14:10 or in this case thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:14:34 Most toxic designs can halt that design
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:17:31 Also
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:17:43 not just an explosives shotgun
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:18:02 anyone spamming explosive balls might instantly shut down that sphere
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:18:44 When your main weapon is melee you can't really fight against barbed wire
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:19:35 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:20:25 Whatever this is
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:21:27 About a
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:21:36 1.75
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:22:41 2 might work but it'd be even more  w a c k  than it currently is
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:18:19 Idea: What if the material metal damaged cutters
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:18:40 after all there is no blade on earth immune to metal
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:19:17 also
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:19:55 metal is now 50x heavier, produces drag, and lowers the max speed of every block attached to the creation
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:20:32 correct, if you want to tank shredder bugs, you're gonna need a tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:21:16 actually
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:21:20 new material
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:22:44 shock fiber, when there's a-
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:22:48 perfection
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:23:11 bug spray, applies a repelling force to cutters
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:26:11 Dumb idea: Conic EMP, temporarily shuts down enemy motors, pistons, missile reload, wheels, etc, you only get like 1-3
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:26:42 but only in a specific cone of vision
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:27:31 There's a minute cooldo-
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:27:43 T o n k
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:28:35 the cooldown is on the client itself, only using multiple accounts can get around the cooldown
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:29:20 the other emp blocks given are for in the event one is broken you can still shut down something
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:29:46 OH
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:29:48 what if
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:30:42 freeze shotgun, works like the conic EMP but it fires a shotgun spray of particles that temporarily shut down things

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 02:53:42 I feel like
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 02:55:37 the gravity should be automatically reduced exponentially as you approach the end of the altimeter, helium blocks linearly lose effect, so do wings, parachutes, and jet engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 02:57:37 All you need to do is just add a script that activates above a set altitude that checks height and applies a function limiting the force applying component of the block
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 03:00:26 Wing blocks:
Script is parented to the block
While (Spawned in) do
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 03:00:28 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 03:01:28 Is there a way to just say "Height" in scripting or do I need to make a variable that is always equal to the part's height?

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:48:58 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:13 If you pull up hard on most planes while going fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:21 the wings will quite literally flap
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:25 if the wings cannot flap
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:29 the craft will
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:50:12 My theory is it's how the wings are scripted
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:50:46 they're likely body gyros or something similar and their intensity changes with speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:51:16 if some of them disagree with others in extreme situations
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:51:29 while going at high speed for example
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:51:36 a feedback loop may occur
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:00 where the instability itself is the cause for the continuation of the stability
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:18 I wonder how fast you need to go before it becomes a positive feedback
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:48 My plane works simple
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:57 If problem, Pull up

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:54:14 This is your current path
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:15 This is your missile, assuming it has wing blocks near the front and back
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:26 Think of your path like a train rail
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:37 think of your vehicle as a train
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:41 but there is a problem
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:10 the vehicle does not have wheels that can vary in angle for turning
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:28 and the vehicle is too long and intolerant of rail turns
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:32 it will attempt to derail
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:57:43 This is your path
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:58:46 This is the issue
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:16 The wings of the section not on blue are desperately trying to cross the orange gap
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:45 When they do, the pattern flips and the tips now want to move back
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:00:07 but the plane moved and rotated more, creating more weirdness and incorporating more messes

bug-reports 2020-11-15 09:46:51 > [BUG REPORT] Sometimes when I join a Plane Crazy server, when I build, **the blocks do not appear before I place them**, which makes building difficult since I’m rotating the object blindly. _[DEVICE INFO: iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 14.1, Roblox Version 2.455.413788.]_
Similar but probably known issue: When in first person build mode, both the block and helper arrow vanish, the green lines remain, odd issue...

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:23:52 I'm still working on a prototype warp drive
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:23:55 just
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:24:04 yeet the craft as hard as possible
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:24:10 ignoring things breaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:24:50 I want 0 to at least 5000 speed in under 0.5 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:24:57 If possible that will rise to 10000
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:25:25 I've been studying a rare reaction with pistons and motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:25:43 it used to break my base's door
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:26:00 I had a set of 3 pistons push a stressed motor forwards
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:26:15 when the motor lifted the VERY heavy door assembly
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:26:26 the pistons became extremely stressed
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:26:42 and provided a force that overpowered the 2 max torque motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:27:01 spinning the door through the frame stops
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:27:19 almost crushing the door's 4 physics anchors
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:27:57 Pistons behave strange
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:28:05 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:28:31 Any game with a part that constrains itself to moving along a fixed path behaves strange
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:29:46 Suspension implodes if overstressed
Wings shake while overcompensating for a turn at high speed
Pistons apply strange false forces to the held object
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:40:02 I might have found a possible solution, continuing research
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:40:17 Something to do with hover drives under extreme stress
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:41:15 It even moves the physics anchor about 5 blocks from it's anchor point!
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:43:08 Doesn't look like much but it's unrefined currently
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:43:32 Testing speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:44:59 It gets to around 4000 but mostly aided by gravity
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:47:19 woah
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:47:40 This thing is stronger than helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:47:48 Infinite acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:47:52 Controllable direction
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:48:07 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:48:49 Sadly it appears to slow down near the floating point zone
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:49:11 Probably because the hover thruster can't find the block below it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:49:25 Maybe if I increase the surface...
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:50:00 Remember
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:50:18 This is no motor lock
one thruster
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:50:54 12 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:51:01 and I can probably drop that number easily
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:52:12 I wonder
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:56:45 A few more blocks and a bit slower acceleration but it can now hit 5k starting at base just going up
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:56:57 it hits that at about 150% of the altimeter range
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:57:12 Now I'm gonna stretch the design
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:57:24 and reconfigure the hover
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:59:34 Refined the design, processing a video atm
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:00:01 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:01:36 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:02:36 The way floating point warps faces
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:02:37 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:06:36 With 7 thrusters it hits 5k at 7500 on the altimeter
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:07:40 Speed decay started while I was tabbed out, this is the recorded sped
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:08:40 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:09:16 This is all I needed to do and it instantly made me hit my goal
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:09:37 Pushing to make the acceleration to 10k in under a half second

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:10:22 Bo
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:12:47 The craft attempts to move before I start it, It'll slow down a bit but I'll add more space
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:15:35 My goal isn't compactness
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:15:53 It's how fast can I accelerate to extreme speed without motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:16:06 and without super thruster spam
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:17:15 So close
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:18:42 At this point there is no need for me to extend the piston
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:19:04 Also
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:19:41 This device will be mounted inside a flying destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:20:04 The main goal of mine is power over weight

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:26:34 Lemme remind you
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:26:44 I'm gonna strap this thing to a flying destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:00 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:02 Sadly
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:09 And disappointingly,
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:17 This design is not suited for high mass
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:37 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:28:57 But it presented a nice idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:30:52 New idea: Abuse the auto retract of springs
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:34:42 Idea: Ropes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:40:32 Ropes suck
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:40:49 Idea: Magnets
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:53:08 Project obsidian was a failure
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:53:32 Switching to a different type of hover insanity

bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:26:38 Anchored trapdoors cannot open or close.
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:27:04 Might be useful but still important to point out
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:28:41 The point of the anchor block being there is usually because it's attached to a large base
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:09 I mean
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:17 they find what they are attached to and anchor it
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:47 but if motors are excluded, why doesn't the trapdoor, another rotating part, get excluded
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:31:35 Unless it's because rickje decided to spaghetti and broke the concept of motors also getting anchored

bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:25:50 New option for anchor blocks "Unanchor on break or cutoff"
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:27:38 Just occasionally asks blocks anchored by that anchor and no others "Am I attached to this anchor?" and if not, unanchor.
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:29:38 If a block is anchored by multiple anchors, it goes down a list of connected anchors, once all are crossed off and damage was taken, pop
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:30:09 Oh, also run the check whenever a disconnector activates
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:31:40 Trying to come up with an optimized solution but I just find it annoying that my bases cannot be destroyed satisfyingly as the anchored sections like to stay anchored

the-dump 2020-11-19 19:42:58 Here's a delicious tutorial that I will probably never use: https://youtu.be/c3iVKTENKwA
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:43:20 Instantaneous downvote
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:43:38 is there a bot that auto downvotes the word tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:44:23 also, the chain was moving slower than a turtle glued to the floor of a cryogenic stasis pod
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:44:44 so a chain break wouldn't have started that
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:37 Here's a fun fact:
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:41 School is a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:49 we all operate under a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:47:00 so you just managed to manifest your knowledge of + - * / when you were young
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:03 Who made the hamburger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:34 Then the reasonable conclusion is that a fast food employee made it
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:59 that employee likely went to a school to easily learn how to make that burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:49:22 thereby the burger was a modified tutorial creation
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:49:43 In the event that god made the burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:50:37 The initial quantum fluctuation that resulted in the big bang and thus our manifestation of a god
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:51:21 likely resulted from noise of previous universes or multiverse interference
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:51:53 thereby the total collective of noise generation assembles into a tutorial of how to start a universe
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:03 and everything is now a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:13 including god which is the burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:55 And thus I have validated my reason to define a video as a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:56 anyways

the-dump 2020-11-19 20:03:28 stars were founded by the explosion of a singularity
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:03:54 this singularity formed the universe
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:13 see my previous explanation for how the universe was a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:47 well
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:51 here's my reasoning
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:05:04 for the stars to exist the universe has to exist
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:05:16 with the big bang the universe was formed
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:06:45 to conclude: because the universe was a tutorial, doritos.

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:39:31 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:39:46 I wonder if
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:40:12 Is this motor accessible to be attached to
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:42:33 The best advice I can offer is find any available spots that don't obstruct the turrets and add a filler material, that's the absolute worst case, it'll act at least as a filler keeping the main turret looking not as hollow
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:43:52 If you have the potential to do so another option is adding a surface type variant of the filler, where it's sculpted to the exterior, the problem with this is that it's a lot harder to precisely align and will likely result in some frustrating tweaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:44:58 A rather on the nose solution is to add an additional motorlock pylon that just slaps a roof down, Probably best to leave a hole for the top turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:45:56 But I have barely any experience in motor lock so if this doesn't work then I'm sorry, you can look to other motor lock tutorials and other people on this server, this is the best I've got

I'll say this: I can justify a few but invalidate a lot more of those reasons, my major trigger is people deciding to attempt to degrade others with no backing and I am fully ready to counter, additionally I must remind others that this argument on both my side and theirs is verging towards rule 1, so I'll stop now.

the-dump 2020-11-21 22:13:39 Exactly the point I'm going for here, neither of us are in the right, because the feedback system encourages non-constructive criticism and making others provide the constructiveness later
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:15:05 This is the reason as to why most online purchase sites make you write a complaint before reviewing

the-dump 2020-11-22 10:25:56 Old is based on the context
the-dump 2020-11-22 10:27:13 Old milk, implies it transitioned to an expired state, unless it's some 75% preservative ""Milk"" then that expiration date is rather short
the-dump 2020-11-22 10:28:24 Old wine, wine that somehow exceeded the time where it was good wine, unless it's some form of fake wine made from milk then it probably took a while to get there

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:12:27 I wonder
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:12:46 Would the 4 wings make it qualify as a biplane?
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:12:57 Well
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:13:17 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:13:49 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:14:08 Reasonably control surfaces not actively in use should qualify as wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:14:58 Dammit
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:15:23 Actually that defintion overlooks something
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:16:37 The relativity of "above"
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:16:52 The margin of error for "above"
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:17:06 The plane could pitch down and transform into a biplane
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:18:07 I kinda wish I could have the option to display and name buttons on my screen

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 05:19:23 And you can't just pull the keyboard apart and rearrange it into the most optimal controls for the craft

creations-chat 2020-11-24 13:13:30 To me that mech looks like some sunburnt dude who skipped leg day and was chopped into 32 pieces
creations-chat 2020-11-24 13:15:22 A suggestion to the creator of the mech: make the legs look like they can support the upper body and avoid doing that "crimp" effect where everything gets cut off just before the connection to the next part
creations-chat 2020-11-24 13:19:11 Possible alternatives to the crimp: joint cuff, motor lock somehow, rope based cuff
Alternatives to chicken legs from specific angles: motor lock somehow, adding detail to the sides of the legs and pulling everything inwards, and non inverse joint leg design

the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:26 and then they soar off the mountain into the rock pile below
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:04 Call it dark humor next time you find debris at the bottom of a cliffside road

the-dump 2020-11-26 01:48:36 People were yelling to pull the E brake and throw him off the seat
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:48:44 but they couldn't
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:49:51 Seeing as the level of concentration required, doing such a thing would cause the bus to crash
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:16 It's called choosing my words
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:41 Right now I'm very angry so I need to rewrite with a calm tone
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:55 The compounded effect of forcing the passengers into stress, the stop button risking potential crash, and the effects of such, creates a scenario almost similar to holding 24 people at gunpoint
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:52:43 Now
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:07 Explain why it is ok to do such an act as to unwillingly hold people so close to death
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:22 one slight of hand away from heaven
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:11 one could say that making a wrong turn is as simple and as deadly in that scenario as pulling a trigger
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:55:32 
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:07 "A chance of survival"
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:33 What if you were sitting in the front row of a bus and I told you that 2 flips of a coin could decide if you live or die
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:07 Would you just be ok with a "Chance of survival"
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:22 That changes the scenario
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:32 there's 24 revolvers pointed at 24 people
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:42 all are loaded with 2 bullets
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:52 spun to random position
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:58:28 Would you still be ok that at any moment one spin of a wheel could pull the trigger of every revolver?
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:04 In fact
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:13 I don't even need to specify an exact round count
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:28 for front to back the number varies from 1 to 5
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:06 Let's consider this across 2 comparative scenarios
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:23 You just boarded the bus with 24 other people
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:31 the driver parked normally
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:29 but as you started travelling through the forest, you noticed they were getting faster and faster, taking turns sharper than a professional racer
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:41 you did not sign up for some crazy rollercoaster
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:46 there are no safeties

the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:28 at any moment if they went off the road you've got a fair chance of death, possibly higher, possibly lower
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:51 Tell me then
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:04:28 if the point of the video isn't that the passengers are screaming, tell me why there are passengers, tell me why their every cry is captioned for the world's review
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:05:38 The one man who decided to record a video, risking their life to grab the evidence required to lock that person up
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:06:39 Witnesses alone cannot win a case
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:10 Reasonably you could tell a group of 24 people to randomly go after a bus driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:34 that bus looked to be an old model that didn't have a built in camera
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:42 That makes me suspect that this was some form of casual operation with the co driver filming
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:46 but then again
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:52 HOW THE HELL IS THIS FUCKING CASUAL
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:08 EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IT IS OK
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:22 But still
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:36 the recording of this event proves that it happens so often it can be caught on film
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:34 Indicating that this driver risks a group's life
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:42 even monthy
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:48 even yearly
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:52 it still wouldn't be ok
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:08 this passed the point of dark humor
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:11 this is law material
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:30 I'm gonna try to reverse search this and get as much info as I can on that driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:53 Ya see
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:02 the humor falls off when it is no longer funny
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:19 in this case it isn't funny for any mentally sane human
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:14:22 Tell me now
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:15:01 Moderation can I ask this person if I can DM them a case similar to the one far above
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:15:14 except they crash
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:27:59 
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:28:33 Hey
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:28:46 as they said dark humor can be as bad as dead people

general 2020-11-26 17:02:46 P o l y g o n
general 2020-11-26 17:04:11 It points up through magic
general 2020-11-26 17:04:29 Theoretically
general 2020-11-26 17:05:03 Unless the turret completely uncovers the bottom when pointing up, there's basically no protection at this seam
general 2020-11-26 17:05:32 But then again this tank is designed to be a stealth tank
general 2020-11-26 17:05:36 a STEALTH TANK
general 2020-11-26 17:06:02 HOW DO YOU STEALTH A CANNON ON TRACKS
general 2020-11-26 17:06:42 It's a popular design
general 2020-11-26 17:06:46 
general 2020-11-26 17:08:04 Then how bout you come up with a tank of equal simplicity
general 2020-11-26 17:08:32 Also
general 2020-11-26 17:08:38 you want bad tank design?
general 2020-11-26 17:08:51 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-26 17:10:09 Explain to me why long range support tanks are required
general 2020-11-26 17:10:25 when you can wheel in a far more powerful artillery piece
general 2020-11-26 17:10:37 and if the enemy can snipe you
general 2020-11-26 17:10:50 then how come they don't see the tank
general 2020-11-26 17:10:57 and attempt to attack it
general 2020-11-26 17:11:29 
general 2020-11-26 17:12:35 Like
general 2020-11-26 17:12:39 Just
general 2020-11-26 17:12:57 1: Hole
2: Sandbags
3: Mortar
general 2020-11-26 17:13:05 Repeat for surrounding area
general 2020-11-26 17:13:46 Define capture point in real war
general 2020-11-26 17:14:40 Javelin?
general 2020-11-26 17:15:08 The 15 helicopters defending the white house?
general 2020-11-26 17:15:56 Still, that long range tank generally sucks, If I were to design one it would focus on a mortar like action
general 2020-11-26 17:16:16 yeah
general 2020-11-26 17:16:39 Planes instantly kill long range tank and can achieve both mortar tasks and the tank's at higher capacity
general 2020-11-26 17:18:50 If you have the money for a box of metal with artillery inside
general 2020-11-26 17:19:11 you should invest in finding a better plan than sniping something in clear daylight
general 2020-11-26 17:20:37 Bro just

general 2020-11-26 17:23:37 __***G   U   N   .***__
general 2020-11-26 17:24:25 which is why long range dedicated tanks are fading out and useless, their task is already done
general 2020-11-26 17:25:21 This is dave
general 2020-11-26 17:26:00 It's a way of one way RPC

general 2020-11-26 17:26:19 Metal beats rock

general 2020-11-26 17:26:58 more gun beats more metal
general 2020-11-26 17:27:23 and so on
general 2020-11-26 17:28:18 The abrams has over a mile range
general 2020-11-26 17:28:34 And then it goes
general 2020-11-26 17:28:44 "If they be snipin, look for snipers"
general 2020-11-26 17:28:51 and while they doing that
general 2020-11-26 17:29:06 the enemy just snuck up and lined up a deadly shot close range
general 2020-11-26 17:29:19 and now it's a game of balancing RPC
general 2020-11-26 17:30:11 says the person who thinks outdated tank designs are still practical in their form
general 2020-11-26 17:31:09 Because still
general 2020-11-26 17:31:15 reguardless
general 2020-11-26 17:31:26 This tank would not fair in today's wartime

the-dump 2020-11-26 17:42:20 <@!159985870458322944> is 4 years old

the-dump 2020-11-26 17:46:59 jam
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:29:19 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:30:03 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:03 So people disagreed with the previous tank design being bad
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:06 what about this one
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:08 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:36:54 Ok I don't even know what this is
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:37:00 good or bad
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:39:16 if I were to design a tank
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:39:54 First thing I'd investigate is the potential for a simple way to compress and hide it in the ground
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:40:11 a pre-placed tank ready for battle is always good
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:20 In games where people build tanks there's usually track tensioning
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:37 Let's first try to collapse the abrams into a cube
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:42 what would be required
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:42:30 Well the internals of the turret have crewspace and probably some area for recoil dampening, if that space was used to slide the barrel assembly back then the barrel is out of the question
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:43:18 Considering track tension systems we could probably shift the track wheels around and pull the tracks in a bit so that's done
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:44:43 Ex: Remove any wheels not visible between that bottom and top wheel, move the top down halfway and put it between the next top and bottom set
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:45:09 I'm trying to compress the abrams into a cube
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:45:45 Goal is
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:46:44 A tank rivaling the common tanks that prioritizes having as many configurations as possible while still being able to be easily hid underground
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:48:11 then let's work on minimizing friction at the driving point
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:48:31 Quite a lot of options
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:49:22 Tank tracks are similar to a deflated wheel, the difference being a load of wheels are required to keep it in the specific shape
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:02 Trying to find which is better
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:12 multiple medium size wheels
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:30 or tracks with a lot more small wheels
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:51:34 Considering the goal is to minimize friction and fuel consumption for the high mass, wheels should be the option
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:51:55 Ooh
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:52:26 Wheels could also let me compact them easily due to SOFT
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:54:28 For variability, I'm thinking 2 possible options
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:56:23 Dumb idea but
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:56:32 Prefire
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:57:39 if there's a screw like pattern in a high speed spinning barrel, and a static key in the center with a firing activator at some point in the middle
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:58:23 the key could move to various positions to guarantee optimal firing power
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:59:20 I say it's a dumb idea because it completely missed an even greater concept

creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:09:38 Mechs mainly exist with the purpose of power, not defense
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:11:24 You wanna take this cargo container size thing from the top of this building and place it under a bridge? The mech can do that in a minimum of 15 seconds, much faster than the building to a tower crane to a truck to a loader to the bridge
Mechs are typically a mixture of a tank, legs, a crane, a loader, a forklift, and many other pieces of utility.
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:13:17 (At the cost of being quite literally the largest active target available)
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:14:58 Exosuits (aka: tiny mechs) are much more effective as they simply boost the armor, carrying capacity, endurance, and general strength of the wearer, allowing for things like wielding a minigun in battle
Sadly this is plane crazy not exosuit crazy so those aren't exactly possible

the-dump 2020-11-30 13:48:39 When you
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 13:53:00 I remember making that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 13:56:26 Searching it rn
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:25:30 I just say this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:26:00 The farther travel distance the less damage
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:26:18 after some time it completely burns out and only a spark falls to the ground
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:27:21 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:27:25 What if
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:27:44 the time until explosion and distance were separate
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:28:04 Now it can be a mortar
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:28:14 or a lot more things
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:28:36 also, it would help with the fireworks actually being fireworks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:32 OOH
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:34 idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:38 prob dum but sitll
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:41 still
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:44 stronk
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:29:47 uh
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:30:05 there aren't specific delay sliders
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:30:13 rather composition sliders
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:31:07 You need to sacrifice explosive power, speed, or absence of drop, to raise speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:31:10 wh
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:31:13 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:31:22 decrease speed to raise speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:31:30 what I meant was
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:32:30 you control
How far the firework goes
Bullet drop of the firework
Explosive power of the firework
Ammo capacity of the launcher
Fuse length
Fuse type
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:32:40 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:32:47 they are all connected
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:33:38 to make more boom you either make the firework larger, sacrificing ammo, or eat the fuel, sacrificing distance, speed, and going in a straight line
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:34:20 Theoretically this could improve firework so much it makes gun obsolete
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:34:29 just use a bunch of tiny fireworks instead
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:35:05 then again
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:35:56 the game is hardcoded*

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:37:19 **does not have the materials to develop properly\*\*\*
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:38:00 ***Doesn't have enough devs
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:38:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:38:20 basically
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:39:00 Near FTD level weapon customization, one block, too complicated for devs
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:39:17 I'm still angry about the stairs
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:39:26 like bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:39:48 we could've had 2 step stairs functional as both stairs and a half block corner

the-dump 2020-12-01 12:39:43 Though I understand it is a joke I'd advise against telling people to make mustard gas.
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:39 Well
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:43 very close to it
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:52 you will still die
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:06 in a similarly painful way
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:45 having your lungs disintegrate is usually quite bad
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:59 however
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:42:17 applying urine to the mixture also introduces mustard gas
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:43:28 
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:43:55 So now both your skin and lungs are being eroded

the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:13 and everywhere
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:47 actually I think it might even erode some objects
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:46:43 also I would recommend applying urine by
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:46:48 1: adding it to a container
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:47:06 2: attaching container to bleach container

the-dump 2020-12-01 12:48:09 "Health dangers. But chlorine itself is very reactive with the human body and very toxic.

plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:30:18 I mean theoretically any point of a creation with a crease created via motor can be counted as a fold or just a bend, considering that they are the exact same
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:31:05 if the rotated object is symmetrical, then every time it aligns with the next point of symmetry it is no longer folded

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:51:57 Man I wish there was a mirror mode
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:58:14 Wheels are heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:58:26 Mostly because this is 80% metal
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:58:30 but still
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:03:46 I'd prefer just a snowball tbh
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:03:58 a non damaging winter theme explosive ball
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:04:05 might push things a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:04:12 but that's it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:04:58 Kar
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:12:46 It seems the button to shut off the snow thing does not work for mobile
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:12:59 so mobile users do not have access to the snow blaster
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:13:27 I'm on PC
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:13:33 dumb
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:14:35 They're glitching into the blaster room to grab it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:14:59 This is the problem

the-dump 2020-12-18 02:54:54 ‭
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:00:00 ‭
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:25:42 I can't remember
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:26:11 Is that demon the one who breaks your knees to ensure you stay with them
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:26:20 or the other one
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:08 I've discovered a loophole
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:17 Though specifying earth seconds
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:47 it does not specify earth seconds relative to time elapsed from your perspective
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:00:03 so I could fall into a black hole and never have those 10 seconds pass
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:00:19 k
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:01:31 Well that was boring
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:08:14 
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:09:56 An extension to this is that if you are aware of a furry and have not attacked them during beat a furry day, you accept their presence in this world and consider them a friend
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:10:45 You are aware that then you will need to sit around with a corpse for 12 hours right?
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:06 and once again
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:25 the furry related action must be on your side
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:34 and be done in their proximity
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:12:46 So you must do a furry related action within proximity of the furry regardless of their condition
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:13:12 Do not remind me of him
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:14:59 All I can say without risking warn is
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:16:54 I'm on alert and ready

the-dump 2020-12-18 04:41:22 The timer image
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:41:38 is vulnerable to cards
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:42:19 So be ready to ping yourself if you try that crap again
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:43:12 Then again cards are vulnerable to cards so also be prepared for a reverse chain fighting under a timer
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:49:05 Tell me
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:49:08 
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:49:36 Are those vertical cylinders on the truck or on the ground
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:52:54 Sadly, those two workers suffered severe injuries
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:53:08 they tried to defrost a valve with a blowtorch
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:53:22 not accounting that the empty truck may have fuel vapors left inside

the-dump 2020-12-20 02:28:15 starting off with simple tricks
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:28:16

the-dump 2020-12-20 02:28:41

the-dump 2020-12-20 02:29:10 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:29:21 Moving to more advanced areas
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:30:02 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:31:07 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:31:23 These do not symbolize objects, rather variables to identify
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:16 This gets confusing after around the 8th step
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:41 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:51 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:34:00 May as well start forcing you to do everyone's taxes too
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:37:43 One final problem
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:37:54 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:39:11 Sorry, wrong image

the-dump 2020-12-20 03:33:37 About trollface, I say it is at time of upload for this message excluding all other messages on the subject, 2
2: Complete shit

2: Deserves to die
2: Will receive hatred for the rest of my life
the-dump 2020-12-20 03:34:37 Cognition factory's intermediate section?
the-dump 2020-12-20 03:35:57 Solution:
the-dump 2020-12-20 03:36:07 It's just bits of very sharp skull
the-dump 2020-12-20 03:36:22 hehe
the-dump 2020-12-20 04:51:47 
the-dump 2020-12-20 04:52:26 Hmm
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:05:37 Be advised
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:05:48 Fur day is now in effect
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:12:41 
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:12:56 
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:02 If any were curious as to why I was sealing loopholes in fur day
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:07 one simple reason
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:12 I don't got friends
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:25 0% chance of furry involvement
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:54:08 The event is designed around giving the introverted something to feel good about
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:54:58 Hm
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:55:17 Another loophole I will keep open is
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:55:26 you don't need to participate if you are the furry
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:13 I never got that
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:28 What is the problem with linking them parallel
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:51 too much power?
general 2020-12-20 20:04:15 Lmao that's a classic

the-dump 2020-12-21 18:04:09 Attention
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:04:41 Critical notice
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:04:50 Do not click any video containing this image
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:05:15 **Your discord will be shut down temporarily**
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:06:32 I know how it works but I do not want to give any opportunity to create more
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:07:44 Theoretically it can be classified as malicious but as it is harmless as long as it is not played
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:08:54 Note: Don't try to be a daredevil by starting and stopping the video, as long as the play button is clicked your client will freeze
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:12:13 
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:16:26 The following messages will contain multiple redacted sections marked with a reference to "[unspecified]" instead.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:18:26 It is very difficult to write a message about why the video will crash [unspecified] it is played on
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:22:06 The major function that breaks unprotected [unspecified] is the [unspecified], [unspecified] an effective infinite number of times at once near the end of [unspecified]. This presents a major flaw in many security systems as almost none have a defense against [unspecified] based attack, all it needs is an attached plan.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:23:01 Good, this minimizes chances that you can recreate such an attack
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:25:50 To those who hold the words to fill in what I have redacted, please refrain from distributing it, the worst case scenario is that many duplicates are made and a surge of client crashing [unspecified] completely kills off trust of [unspecified] on discord until a patch is made.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:27:17 It is my absolute priority to distribute warning without distributing means of creation, modification, or improvement
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:28:24 I shall not accept payment in exchange for information

the-dump 2020-12-23 17:01:13 then the troll shall never consume again as I add a razor blade to the custom section
the-dump 2020-12-23 17:02:21 also, not being able to consume because there's knives holding your mouth shut usually also means you can't move your mouth well so this should prevent the troll from smiling again

bug-reports 2020-12-24 02:12:09 Copy and paste does not properly copy recently changed settings
Steps to reproduce error
1: Place 2 Signs or text blocks (Recommend of same type to minimize variables)
2: Change text of first sign (Recommend "Old text A") and close the settings menu
3: Change text of second sign (Recommend "Old text B") and close the settings menu
4: Change text of first sign (Recommend "New text A") and **do not** close the settings menu
5: Press C (**Not** Ctrl+C, though it has similar effect it will break your ability to copy paste anything inside or outside roblox until you leave the game) (Without exiting the settings menu) to copy settings
6: Close settings menu and configure the second sign
7: Press V (**Not** Ctrl+V, effects untested, likely to break copy paste on your device similar to above note on Ctrl+C) to paste settings
8: Sign B should now read the text created before sign A was edited the second time (Recommended should result in "Old text A")

the-dump 2020-12-26 03:09:25 basically
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:10:27 I think the odd thing is how it transitions between near perfect orthographic and perspective

the-dump 2020-12-26 03:14:21 semiorthograph
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:14:52 like if you imitated ortho with low fov perspective and being really far away
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:16:15 but the ortho was created because at close with normal it appears stretched
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:17:02 like if someone took a really fucked up kitchen display and tried to make it look normal with camera position and angle
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:16 Basically
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:33 if you like seeing things use perspective
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:53 if you like making things using 4 different cameras use orthographic

the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:51 The hate of furries has died aggressively
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:08:04 the source of the reason to hate was satire
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:08:10 It's just individuals
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:09:12 There's a difference between furries and zoophiles in case you didn't get the memo too
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:16:04 According to theories based on the current state of evolution and man's best friend
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:16:29 it is physically impossible to extract furries from humanity without killing every dog
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:17:24 So either deal with it or continue wasting time yelling, they aint' going anywhere
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:18:51 Actually there were
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:19:12 Technically you could even say there were furries in the Egyptian eras
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:20:00 As long as we can let other creatures into our living space there will be a constant inflow of furry psychology
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:20:40 And if you disagree with me then how about I start defending anime instead
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:21:28 I wonder how long until people start getting drawn to plants then
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:22:16 It's the nature of the human mind "we are friends with [this], what would be a step closer that improves practical implication"
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:22:41 furries are not practical, but for the sake of the human mind it's the closest they can make

the-dump 2021-01-02 17:25:42 with a paper airplane on it
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:26:51 It seems the whole reason PCC is being held back is because of the passive retention of toxicity through a multitude of things
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:27:37 Shredder bugs

plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:32:32 Here's an idea: If you don't place a main pilot seat you just spawn on top the center of mass and can press controls without sitting down
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:33:09 Not in the center of mass, in the closest 2 block space above the center of mass
the-dump 2021-01-04 01:34:01 Preform the act of collecting a reality
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:34:17 Isn't there that out of seat exploit?
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:34:30 if it already works, why not make it a feature?
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:34:55 Or just a button in settings
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:35:02 "Out of seat control"
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:36:27 What if you wanted to for example have a floating base with an elevator you need to lower
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:36:40 I would prefer not needing a chair sitting at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:37:02 and I also don't want the elevator always in the down position when I am at the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:38:09 Another thing would be ex: if you were operating a crane or factory but don't wanna sit at a control room
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:38:22 also yeah, key emulation buttons is better
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:38:56 Just a clickdetector where you set the key it simulates when someone touches
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:39:23 Great for elevators, doorbells, basically anything
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:40:53 Ball sockets would be good for hinges too, so you don't need strange disruptive weirdnesses, just put 2 ball sockets next to one another
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:41:46 What would the attachment points be tho?
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:41:56 every side? front and back?
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:42:29 It would be very helpful for suspension joints if it's every side
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:42:43 another thing I was thinking about was signed linkages
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:43:09 A block where you enter an ID into it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:43:34 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:43:38 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:43:39 A block where you enter an ID into it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:43:57 and any other block with a matching ID will try to connect as hard as possible with a ballsocket
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:45:17 Parts that are connected together by the signed linkage may have nocollide with one another if possible when checked in configuration
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 01:45:45 Motorlock doesn't connect 2 blocks with a ballsocket dummy

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:36:30 You just called something you were using, a tutorial.
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:38:16 Or just avoid using motor lock for external things
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:38:26 maybe make the motor lock a part of the design
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 18:41:10 if you really hate the look of motor 2 you might be able to put the motor 2 inside and use a chain of cameras to link it to the flap, it'll be motor lock hell to hide the link tho and may have a number of further problems

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:24:46 If you want a ring then that's as smooth as it gets without doing weird scale things and motor lock, if you want filled in then use the cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:25:45 Well what I did for my sphere is
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:27:00 1: Instead of blocks and half wedges, use half blocks and half wedge downs
2: Remove those half wedges on the corners
3: Build the same ring but vertically too
4: You now have the perfect sphere to fill with wedges like half triangle wedge and triangle wedgeblock

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:15:40 the reason that they are bad is because they represent a lack of care for me, like an even sadder version of a script kiddie

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:50:22 Non physics anchors
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:52:46 I'm gonna have to deny your claims that it can move anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:53:02 Mainly because it cannot move while anchored
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:53:11 and as such cannot move the attached block
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:54:11 
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:54:35 (click noise intensifies)
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:55:11 Yeah to move an anchored part through external forces is to rewrite the code of roblox
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:55:54 Physics anchors and unanchored anchors yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:56:01 non physics anchored anchors no

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:18:29 I make my things fair simply by minimizing offense and ensuring it's as reusable as possible
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:19:01 ex: my only folding creation can recompress after folded if it needs to
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:22:12 I mean they are stoppable, its just that they play a set animation which cannot be halted by normal means
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:22:56 It's gotta maintain a set speed as animation is not dynamic and thus is given infinite torque
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:23:53 They were probably some noob minge who doesn't even use settings tool

the-dump 2021-01-31 06:40:12 as lucky for you all the mods are offline
the-dump 2021-01-31 06:40:39 just, dear PCC: while I wait, do not search for the source, it is very nsfw
the-dump 2021-01-31 06:41:21 no visual nsfw, just the suggestion of very nsfw material through text
the-dump 2021-01-31 06:41:48 well, not suggestion, more description followed by logical connections

general 2021-01-31 06:44:21 I still can't figure out what happens in that gif
general 2021-01-31 06:44:27 do they have a seizure or something

the-dump 2021-01-31 06:48:15 2: Outfart the chamber
general 2021-01-31 07:12:03 I prefer the bots because in that game there's a votekick function
general 2021-01-31 07:12:27 Yes
general 2021-01-31 07:13:14 Mainly because with current systems its effectively impossible to realtime change acc name
general 2021-01-31 07:13:28 also that gives me an idea
general 2021-01-31 07:14:13 if someone impersonates you, declare a new name in chat and change your name to it
general 2021-01-31 07:14:32 bots might only change name once
general 2021-01-31 07:15:10 Who else has a favorite gmod server
general 2021-01-31 07:15:40 Darkstorm sandbox is great
general 2021-01-31 07:16:21 its cool to see the final product but in the process of construction is even more interesting because unrefined uncompact tech is clearer
general 2021-01-31 07:16:38 someone literally made a differential for a tractor on darkstorm
general 2021-01-31 07:16:49 I'm still trying to figure out how they did it
general 2021-01-31 07:17:04 they claim physgun only
general 2021-01-31 07:17:26 which actually sorta makes sense as its hard for precision to properly mesh gears
general 2021-01-31 07:18:08 Luckily sandbox servers usually stick to a slightly extended pack of what you normally play with so for me about 80% of the pack was already subscribed to lol
general 2021-01-31 07:18:50 DarkRP is sorta forced into stockpiling addons
general 2021-01-31 07:19:10 because you can't tell a client to download an outfit through outfitter when they pick a role
general 2021-01-31 07:19:20 you gotta have every model downloaded and force it onto them
general 2021-01-31 07:20:41 I dislike DarkRP because they dont let you do anything other than "build room, do job in room, get raided, room destroyed, repeat"
general 2021-01-31 07:21:42 Additional note before someone screams "GoTo DuMp!!1!"
general 2021-01-31 07:23:05 I have a button that doubles mouse sensitivity if I want
general 2021-01-31 07:23:24 Where was that function...

general 2021-01-31 07:24:21 
general 2021-01-31 07:24:41 Serves basically no purpose but its neat
general 2021-01-31 07:28:11 Should I try to stream teardown?
general 2021-01-31 07:28:24 Can I even stream?
the-dump 2021-01-31 07:37:33 An improved map wouldn't be too hard to implement, you don't hardcode roblox terrain
the-dump 2021-01-31 07:37:59 no moving around things required, just an extension to the edges
the-dump 2021-01-31 07:40:10 Though if you wanted a complicated scripted thing to be fitted in then a self resetting basic physics tower could work, an assembly of like 10 parts would work
the-dump 2021-01-31 07:40:25 and thats pretty damn simple
the-dump 2021-01-31 07:40:28 anyways

general 2021-01-31 07:49:19 Alr
general 2021-01-31 07:49:35 I'mma try to stream teardown for no reason
general 2021-01-31 07:51:14 Might be appeal-able but usually these roles are given to people who did bad things in creations
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 07:54:27 How specifically do the shift
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 07:54:45 pull apart back into the motorlocked config
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 07:55:09 motors intersecting blocks do tend to mess up and bend things when not locked
general 2021-01-31 07:56:35 Alright this should work

plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:54:20 203mm howitzer using 75-100% length capacity
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:56:16 With 3 minute travel time you need to perfectly predict the wind direction
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:57:46 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:57:54 we need 1600 mm
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:06 bolt it into the hull of a ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:17 use like 25 anchors to hold it down
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:51 Its literally just
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:00:07 1600 mm would just be
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:00:12 
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:00:35 It cant be stored elsewhere or itd probably flip the boat over backwards

plane-crazy 2021-02-04 21:18:24 So I don't have to place like 50 ballasts on a motor for it to have torque yet still take time to accelerate

plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:34:14 Question
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:34:22 why do we only get 2000 of every block
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:35:15 Its not like they have different levels of performance impact, it'd be better to have a collective max count of blocks you can place
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:37:14 50.7195 types of 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:37:25 that have the limit set at 2k
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:38:12 And you can bypass it by changing material of the part so there's nothing technical going on
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:44:25 Like
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:45:36 I don't think anybody has ever unintentionally used 2000 of these
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:47:04 Why tf was movement mode set
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:16:32 This trap will work in cycles
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:17:03 0: Probably a very subtle latching or one way door
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:17:28 1: Seamless door, you are now trapped in a blank room
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:17:43 2: Walls move to position, room is now rather small
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:18:22 3: Room moves to holding position
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:18:45 4: Drop player into grinder pit or open escape hatch

plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:48:54 would it look better to either
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:49:23 A: Slowly roll out (Walls will be covering the not hole area)
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:49:47 B: Pop down between 0.5 and 0.25 blocks and then roll out
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:53:04 Fun fact: Suspension has a lot more length than the free length slider provides
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:53:52 Changed to 127,127,127
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:54:14 Don't think so
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 01:55:13 Rounded to nearest whole between 0,0,0 and 255,255,255

plane-crazy 2021-02-05 22:59:28 Idea: A self damage option for guns and a self impact option for missiles (they can already hurt you through splash damage)
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 22:59:42 ... For fun
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:18:58 Sometimes its useful to test how damage affects vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:19:58 I told someone to shoot at my base and apparently unanchored blocks are weak af so I learned to anchor the door when closed
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:20:26 It'd be much more useful to be able to not need a second person in a game without whitelist
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:21:07 An idea I just thought of similar to yours
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:21:18 a "town" spawn area
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:21:57 rough estimate of terrain you will spawn in is displayed and blocks below that point are anchored
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:22:24 Good for when you want to put a building level on the ground without building it for the ground
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:25:26 But more important suggestions should go in first like the live speed updating motor and set speed for piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 23:26:11 Imagine if someone painted some frames of bad apple

the-dump 2021-02-08 15:41:35 Birdwatching, or birding, is a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity or citizen science. It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes, by listening for bird sounds, or by watching public webcams.

Birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more easily detected and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods.
the-dump 2021-02-08 15:43:06 The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food) value is traced to the late 18th century in the works of Gilbert White, Thomas Bewick, George Montagu and John Clare. The study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in Britain during the Victorian Era, often associated with collection, eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest. Wealthy collectors made use of their contacts in the colonies to obtain specimens from around the world. It was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds. The Audubon Society was started to protect brids from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.

the-dump 2021-02-08 18:00:11 Spot the difference
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:00:48 Tip: look at the gap between grenade and spoon for both samples
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:02:47 I mean if you control breathing correctly you could at least kill the flame
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:03:12 if co2 proof then use pressure to eject from mouth
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:03:44 If forced in place then use pressure to force mouth open enough to release
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:04:59 If sealed then
A: Control pressure in timed release through nose, will likely fry mouth before burns out but will kill grenade
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:05:41 B: Sacrifice
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:06:21 it will destroy majority of mouth skin in process but unless your skin is stronger than a grenade body or superglue then its the only plan B
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:06:47 If arms are free then find glue release asap while following plan A

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 17:22:00 Idea:
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 17:22:53 I put images of my development of creations into this
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 17:23:16 And the discord timestamps preserve the date
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 17:24:09 Considering my slow build rate it's pretty much impossible to argue with "well I've been taking pictures of my development process since 3 months ago so..."

general 2021-02-09 20:17:45 Is it politic or is it ok
general 2021-02-09 20:22:34 Can y'all just shut before more warns and/or kicks happen
general 2021-02-09 20:24:21 but anyways
general 2021-02-09 20:27:30 Strategy in tic tac toe is rude
general 2021-02-09 20:27:51 it's about planning ahead, not formatting some instant win/draw
general 2021-02-09 20:28:44 not so far ahead that you calculate every best move possible but enough that you don't just let the enemy get 3 in a row
general 2021-02-09 20:33:11 Aaand that might as well be perm

general 2021-02-09 20:48:34 PFFF
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:09 I think there should be a camera mode for motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:25 where it moves based on the position of the cursor on screen
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:35 so you can put a camera on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:39 and have it look around
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:48 without the motor 2 having an absolute heart attack
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:51:10 because currently what it does is it takes where the mouse is pointing at
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:51:17 not where the mouse is on screen
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:51:40 think of it like
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:51:50 the mouse control mode for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:51:57 instead of motor 2 control mode
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:21 no, motor 2 lets you point at a thing and have it face that surface
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:27 I want
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:33 when mouse goes up on screen
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:38 motor go up
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:51 instead of seeing the surface the upwards pointing mouse is facing and continue going up
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:53:20 am I really gonna have to educate you people on how motor 2 works
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:53:38 ugh

the-dump 2021-02-09 20:54:40 
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:59:12 As you can see
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:59:13 
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:59:30 control surface tracks position of mouse relative to screen and adds not to aim at but to equal a determined pitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:00:42 Motor 2 tracks position of mouse relative to where it wants to point
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:01:01 if the rotation of the motor 2 rotates the camera this also rotates the mouse
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:01:08 creating an infinite loop
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:02:20 And I don't wanna center my mouse to stop turning a camera
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:06:40 then it would turn until max angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:07:00 I don't want to have to always look down or up
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:07:13 without centering mouse
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:07:31 and it isn't as simple as infinite speed motor either because how tf do I know when to stop holding key
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:08:40 I want "If I move mouse 3/4ths up the screen, rotate 3/4ths of your max angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:08:43 "
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:09:14 not "rotate at 3/4ths speed towards set direction"

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:26:34 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:27:09 In this game its less about time played and more about quantity of will
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:28:24 I don't wanna list a specific best save with the recent save stealing exploit
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:28:58 But in the event an exploiter is hiding here
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:29:36 Dear exploiter, every one of my saves effectively has a watermark, I have a specific build style that is very difficult to modify or replicate
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:30:18 Additionally, all of my saves are on record down to the second
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:32:15 My style is
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:33:23 Oooo idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:33:36 In the event that they can access the save by name
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:34:13 I can just create trap saves with my name written on them
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:35:00 Seems a bit sus to have "Trap save 04, User: Darmagon3" pop up on someone's plot
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:39:57 "I worked hard for this so now I can restriction free rub it in everyone's face"
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:40:36 I just got rank to suggest things but I never ended up suggesting the things
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:43:36 Prob would break stuff
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:43:56 but isn't there a built in roblox triangle part

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:18:42 wait what
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:18:58 rickje you ass
this scale was rigged due to bad components

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:19:42 uh
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:19:48 What does this mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:20:08 Still heavier
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:20:19 This is odd
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:20:35 
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:20:51 
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:21:48 weird
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:22:14 Fabric still light tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:23:38 Totally a good idea guys
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:24:10 Wait wtf
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:24:19 it works?!?!

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:27:55 This plane legitimately does better with ice
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:29:18 But immediately nose dives when covered in metal
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:30:31 Metal heavy
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:30:34 is proven
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:31:01 In default it pitches backwards
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:33:10 Do you not see the behavior change
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:33:35 It cannot get off the ground when in metal
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:33:49 even with flip tool
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:34:03 just plops down
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:37:12 Nothing to do with wings either (Block fell down onto platform, is not connected)

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 23:01:37 I'll avoid motorlock unless I need to do something that violates the block bounding boxes
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 23:01:53 In this case I'm gonna make a tiny propeller
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 23:02:21 that spins independently of a cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 23:04:32 Actually nvm I figured out a non motorlock way
bot-central 2021-02-09 23:04:54 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 23:06:58 And then it was removed by roblox for a while
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 00:50:09 Pretty sure it actually means it doesn't detect other player's blocks but could be wrong

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:54:35 The pistons?
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:54:47 but those appear to be just for hover
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:54:53 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:55:01 something must be motorlocked weirdly
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:55:25 what appears to be happening is it confuses the absolute shit out of the server so it stops updating where the plane is for everyone
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:56:22 I wonder... leading edge and falling edge subframe
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:56:53 The giant blob of motorlock is one
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:56:58 I'm guessing
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:58:11 Hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:58:21 If I...

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:18:13 Not even the holy flood paint button?
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:20:04 I swear its the corner of something
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:21:27 You could try to paint every block the color of the sticking out

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:29:01 Landing gear is made of an absurd amount of parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:29:08 well... then again paddlewheel is
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:29:21 but for a single wheel
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:29:29 like bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:29:46 1 for back plate
4 for sides
1 for support
1 for wheel
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:30:09 I think that might be equal to hover thruster in part count

the-dump 2021-02-10 15:20:51 I'd say we need roulette variants

the-dump 2021-02-10 15:21:03 sorry for ping random person
the-dump 2021-02-10 15:21:25 Oh wait nvm thats the guy who I meant to ping anyways
the-dump 2021-02-10 15:21:35 pretend that ping was on the furry @ thing
the-dump 2021-02-10 15:21:49 but we need a roulette version

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 15:57:49 
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 15:58:17 The concept is simple but that's where simplicity stops
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 15:58:19 
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 15:59:05 If I turn the trails would separate
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 15:59:36 plus this is for static application
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:02:12 Still, trails need to move, this will be used for a concept I've been thinking of
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:03:05 Please identify how to make trails create effect while static
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:03:43 Hmm.............
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:03:56 oo idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:04:58 [Long range red/orange snow pipe][Short range blue snow pipe][Smoke pipe]
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:06:00 When you set size to lowest and spread to 0 it creates a flame like effect
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:06:24 where it starts large and doesn't expand
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:07:02 Example 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:07:52 
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:08:11 oof a bit too much length
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:08:39 
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:08:49 2.5 length
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:09:03 testing with smoke
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:09:52 Flame made of smoke is weird so don't
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:17:44 I mean without smoke it looks ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:24:05 testing in flight because why not
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:26:06 Testing spin
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:30:24 Roblox doesn't like this so its the best you can get with just 2 pipes and barely any tuning
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:33:04 If you really wanted to you could make a weird path of cameras to a motor hidden somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:33:44 I say weird path because it cannot clip into ANY blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 16:34:06 motorlock not possible unless its a no collision part
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 17:09:36 A bit rough but its a circle
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 17:09:55 making wedge circles is hard
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 17:22:05 
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 17:23:20 I'm centering it by rotating it and checking distance between a point

general 2021-02-10 22:29:50 
general 2021-02-10 22:33:18 The rose apple is quite interesting
general 2021-02-10 22:33:33 is it even an apple?
general 2021-02-10 22:34:10 Also known as the water apple
general 2021-02-10 22:34:30 and the Java wax jambu fruit

general 2021-02-10 22:36:34 tastes like
general 2021-02-10 22:36:39 there
general 2021-02-10 22:37:02 apparently alternative terms for describing taste are censored
general 2021-02-10 22:38:54 Censored term due to dyno being dumb
general 2021-02-10 22:39:27 oo
general 2021-02-10 22:39:34 there's 2 types of rose apple
general 2021-02-10 22:39:47 the above, and this thing
general 2021-02-10 22:40:06 An apple apparently

general 2021-02-10 22:41:38 wtf
general 2021-02-10 22:42:02 wtf are them then
general 2021-02-10 22:42:45 They can only be classified as "Syzygium jambos"
general 2021-02-10 22:43:49 
general 2021-02-10 22:43:51 wtf
general 2021-02-10 22:44:30 As now know
general 2021-02-10 22:44:43 there is like
general 2021-02-10 22:45:30 so many types
general 2021-02-10 22:45:31 omg
general 2021-02-10 22:45:35 h e p
general 2021-02-10 22:46:11 apple that tastes like rose and has pit?
general 2021-02-10 22:46:34 idk
general 2021-02-10 22:46:49 well they are also known as "water apples
general 2021-02-10 22:46:51 "
general 2021-02-10 22:48:05 Syzygium samarangense
general 2021-02-10 22:48:31 tomato is soft apple

shut
general 2021-02-11 01:12:08 anyways
general 2021-02-11 01:13:05 Nah pretty sure rickje is lazy and only checks for if the signal is detected
general 2021-02-11 01:13:50 just "if [any sort of signal close to forwards], full throttle"
general 2021-02-11 01:15:54 ooooo
general 2021-02-11 01:16:43 if analog input is integrated then you could actually properly control cameras on swivels
general 2021-02-11 01:17:34 like imagine having precise speed control over motors
general 2021-02-11 01:18:22 I wonder...
general 2021-02-11 01:19:02 If I just plug a flight joystick into my computer would plane crazy detect and bind inputs to it?
general 2021-02-11 01:19:14 wouldn't work but still
general 2021-02-11 01:19:26 would it at least detect input from other devices
general 2021-02-11 01:19:59 I mean
general 2021-02-11 01:20:20 hold on
general 2021-02-11 01:21:38 there can't be a way this works right
general 2021-02-11 01:21:53 THIS is a Chinese keyboard
general 2021-02-11 01:22:12 Like
general 2021-02-11 01:22:14 imagine having
general 2021-02-11 01:22:59 56,000  characters to bind to
general 2021-02-11 01:23:24 you only need 3000-4000 to know chinese
general 2021-02-11 01:25:01 note
general 2021-02-11 01:25:17 the chinese keyboard shown has all known characters
general 2021-02-11 01:25:28 the pedals likely switch between sets of keyboards
general 2021-02-11 01:25:45 
general 2021-02-11 01:26:11 and the drum sticks are because the article specifies that it "looks like a drum set"
general 2021-02-11 01:27:05 And its more than just that keyboard
general 2021-02-11 01:27:43 I wonder how many inputs you can possibly fit onto one panel before the computer runs out of things it can recognize them as
general 2021-02-11 01:28:38 And then there's this
the-dump 2021-02-11 01:29:23 
general 2021-02-11 01:30:03 What the hell is this
general 2021-02-11 01:32:00 Exactly
general 2021-02-11 01:32:15 that is why I question if plane crazy can accept binds from more than keyboard
general 2021-02-11 01:35:39 I made thing

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:59:18 I mean theoretically it is possible to make a blacklist for certain structures
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:00:14 just gather some shredder bug templates and a "safe PVP" gamemode
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:01:02 slower spawn times but it checks every position a shredder bug can be in on your plot and instant kills you if it finds one
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:02:21 actually no
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:02:30 just a gamemode where cutter block is disabled
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:02:57 Not removed
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:03:02 just unable to harm others
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:03:36 an alternative is
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:03:48 cutters are no longer nocollide when blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:03:58 this stops blacklist abuse
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:04:18 Hmm...
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:05:07 and explosives lose effect completely on certain people until 60 seconds after you unblacklisted them

the-dump 2021-02-16 05:41:26 If 25 upvote but 25 downvote, that shouldn't be equal to an unnoticed submission
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:33 it means that 50% of people were moved enough by it to help decide its course
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:44 or rather
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:45 rewording
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:43:24 it means that lets say 100 people looked at it, half said "meh, its ok" and moved on
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:43:48 but 50 people said "I want to change the course of this submission"
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:45:45 One of my ideas was
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:45:55 once a set number of people have voted at all
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:46:05 it checks a ratio
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:47:54 Once the balance tips enough and is held there its position is locked
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:48:35 if it tipped > a set % then a set number of rank points are given
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:49:54 Once the balance has locked there's no need to look at it anymore
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:50:06 if you really need processing power then lock things older than 1 month
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:50:37 not like you need a 120 fps live feed on the balance
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:51:21 Did you not hear me when I said it requires a set number of collective votes to start checking
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:06 the locking is a side effect
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:48 Once again
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:52 this is the first prototype
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:24 Once again
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:28 this is the first prototype
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:35 how many times do I need to say it

the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:52 this is the first prototype
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:54:17 The initial design was to create an anti cheat system
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:54:31 to prevent exploiting of the server's obvious design flaws
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:04 The secondary system however
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:24 rather than the excessive processing needed to get into hof
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:43 a simple "most popular of this week" page
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:56:12 attracted the most attention, got the most collective votes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:56:17 upvotes + downvotes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:57:17 Prob not gonna exactly give expert roles outta a popularity graph but its simple
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:14 at the end of the week hyperbot looks at the reaction counter for messages sent after the start of the week
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:29 easy to do too
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:54 I mean if you want you could get a special account running similarly to a bot

the-dump 2021-02-25 15:13:38 maybe full blocks actually
the-dump 2021-02-25 15:14:18 and then there's the fine pixel ones that consist of around an 8x8 grid that you can paint

general 2021-03-02 00:20:39 When you shitpost in general:
general 2021-03-02 00:34:23 Question
general 2021-03-02 00:34:33 can the scripts used by most copy signs?
general 2021-03-02 00:34:51 I wanna write signs in filled volumes of blocks that have my username on them
general 2021-03-02 00:35:12 Hmm
general 2021-03-02 00:35:13 ooo
general 2021-03-02 00:35:23 what if I write it in binary around the perimeter
general 2021-03-02 00:35:37 somehow
general 2021-03-02 00:35:52 morse could work too
general 2021-03-02 00:36:20 just a 1 level of rgb variation on the fence posts
general 2021-03-02 00:36:58 Hmm
general 2021-03-02 00:37:07 how to incorporate an identifier into the design
general 2021-03-02 00:38:15 Hmm
general 2021-03-02 00:41:04 Hmm
general 2021-03-02 00:41:25 I need something that can be clearly seen from any image or angle of the craft
general 2021-03-02 00:41:43 that is also unnoticable without looking for a watermark
general 2021-03-02 00:41:52 no, see above message
general 2021-03-02 00:44:26 Wait
general 2021-03-02 00:44:29 how is this 16 mb
general 2021-03-02 00:44:31 and uploading
general 2021-03-02 00:44:39 Ah
general 2021-03-02 00:44:40 that's why
general 2021-03-02 00:45:22 I wonder if this will work
general 2021-03-02 00:45:28 
general 2021-03-02 00:45:39 Anyways I made a
general 2021-03-02 00:45:53 LCDs need update
general 2021-03-02 00:46:31 yes
general 2021-03-02 14:39:24 I just realized that the copy scripts are a good point to show that build sharing is realistically possible
general 2021-03-02 14:39:33 its just that it doesn't require permission at the moment
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:40:27 I just realized that the copy scripts are a good point to show that build sharing is realistically possible
its just that it doesn't require permission at the moment
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:41:15 Just had a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:41:29 a script that looks for foreign scripts and deletes them
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:42:07 It would have to check every part in the game but would stop copy scripts
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:42:50 Also needs to be a chain of support behind it
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:43:06 where it looks to see if a script deleted was actually also important
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:43:14 and fills it back properly
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:43:41 then there's one script that checks if the deleting script was removed
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:44:03 maybe 4 or so actually so that it can't just be chunk removed to disarm
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:45:08 I don't think there's a way to trace scripts to the creator but if there is then you can also now kick them so they can't try again
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:45:27 Actually yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:45:47 the exploiter could use the script to just kick people with it though
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:45:57 by setting copy location to someone elses plot
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:46:21 Ooo idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:46:31 there's a secret row of 'history' saves
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:46:49 these are to track progress of building things
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:47:40 How fast do you people place blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:48:15 because it'll autosave every minute
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:48:26 or 5 minutes for larger contraptions
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:48:41 just keeping track of how many blocks are on the plot
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:49:01 if you manage to place 250 blocks in 60 seconds without using exploits then that's on you
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:49:27 but this would hard block exploiters from stealing medium-large things
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:49:53 Another trap: block id set
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:50:38 in block configuration you can mark a block to be anti copy protection and write some hidden values into the code of said block
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:51:28 this basically says "this dude made this, if this block is on anyone elses plot then revert their plot to previous autosave"
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:52:33 Because now that i think about it
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:52:44 though they can copy builds and place them on plot
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:53:16 they probably don't have scripts to build on someone elses yet because that would mean that rickje could add whitelist
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:53:21 see above
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 14:54:06 so until theres reports of exploiters tripping anti exploit on someone else then we can go full punishment mode

plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:10:30 With it you can never secure a true victory as it was meant for someone else
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:11:08 Sure you could claim that its like addons of GMOD, nobodys gonna build a heli addon just to proudly beat someone up with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:11:21 But this is a game about building
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:12:00 think of it like building a redstone contraption for mining
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:12:07 in the end yes the blocks were mined
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:12:19 but you just purchased a blueprint and paid with effort
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:12:45 in plane crazy that effort is reduced severely as there are no resource requirements
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 21:14:07 To conclude: Basing your stuff off someone else's work results in a hollow reward.

general 2021-03-06 23:20:16 If you have excessively higher standards than those around you when judging by community vote then expect massive quantities of disapproval.

plane-crazy 2021-03-07 00:16:37 Don't like shredders? Move server!
Don't like the construction noises in town? Move house!
Don't like the absence of care for the homeless in your local city? Move yourself far enough away that you can't see the hostile architecture!
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 00:17:08 Don't want someone copying your stuff after they claim that they have already grabbed images? Run away as nobody will help!
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 00:18:47 Recently scammed and robbed? Just keep walking until physically unable, then curl into a ball and cry!
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 00:19:35 The wonderful world of a land where the leader is too scared of police to get police to handle the much more annoying criminals!

general 2021-03-19 12:59:40 Yes this is the improved version where terrain was dropped for precision
general 2021-03-19 12:59:57 Because roblox sucks at water
general 2021-03-19 13:00:59 Pretty sure if you really wanted you could probably slap the water texture on each of the surfaces but
general 2021-03-19 13:01:22 I like simple water
general 2021-03-19 13:01:58 If I were to make water physics
general 2021-03-19 13:02:20 the only thing I'd use it for is to displace terrain when there's a ship sitting in it
general 2021-03-19 13:03:14 A grid based system where water is only allowed to touch the very outside blocks
general 2021-03-19 13:04:51 What can immediately happen without respaghetting code is terrain expansion
general 2021-03-19 13:05:37 Most code impact I could see is a button added to take you to a larger world

the-dump 2021-03-20 02:50:33 This also implies that dutch is poob
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:52:20 Would provide video but a video of a bee spinning its stinger out of someone's skin is probably classified as med-light nsfw
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:54:43 Also btw the sting juice pump tends to fall off with the stinger and will continue to try and pump
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:55:02 so it is good idea to remove stinger fast
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:58:11 Well its a barbed needle that needs to twist out of a human
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:58:24 Some people dislike needles and this would not help
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:59:46 I got shots monthly for about 4 years so I'm ok with needles but nobody is ok with random stings (except beekeepers)
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:00:44 I got stung when grabbing a fence, there was a bee/wasp on opposite side and finger was placed directly on
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:22 A way to describe it is that
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:31 spray on cut cleaning stuff
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:43 but the cutting item is coated
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:02:28 This stuff
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:02:55 There's a dead wasp nest outside window view from computer
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:03:13 Was sprayed and then entry tunnel smashed

general 2021-03-21 04:17:58 Kinda weird how nobody has thought of making an outline shader
general 2021-03-21 04:18:34 Minecraft optifine has it iirc
general 2021-03-21 04:19:53 Solution: find sharp lighting change on screen and add line between
general 2021-03-21 04:19:58 Post processing effect
general 2021-03-21 04:20:11 fair because it doesn't work when lighting doesn't want you to see the edg
general 2021-03-21 04:20:12 e
general 2021-03-21 04:20:43 Sensitivity system
general 2021-03-21 04:21:00 if it finds many many lines near it ignores area
general 2021-03-21 04:21:08 as in, grass
general 2021-03-21 04:22:00 Then just don't use it
general 2021-03-21 04:22:10 Turn off post processing effect and pow
general 2021-03-21 04:22:15 no more ocd trigger
general 2021-03-21 04:22:44 I wonder
general 2021-03-21 04:22:51 is it possible to detach color from shadow
general 2021-03-21 04:23:01 just look at shadow, no textures
general 2021-03-21 04:23:26 Also y are you being a pyromaster rn
general 2021-03-21 04:23:58 With crude system would double processing requirements as 2 graphics planes would be running
general 2021-03-21 04:24:40 But you would be able to perfectly represent every edge, possibly even filter out voxel terrain edges
general 2021-03-21 04:25:52 prob just something like the blank braille character spammed until new line
general 2021-03-21 04:26:33 Major thing roblox is missing is compatibility and developer control over compatibility
general 2021-03-21 04:27:11 ex: A roblox client addons market and game developers can disable this tool
general 2021-03-21 04:28:12 Probably would be denied if like 2 sentence email sent by one person
general 2021-03-21 04:28:21 But will try
general 2021-03-21 04:28:54 The major thing is that to allow this would effectively triple moderation requirements on items and exploit detection
general 2021-03-21 04:29:51 Best solution I've come up with is something designed for a specific variable anticheat system
general 2021-03-21 04:30:56 `controlled input/output environment to processor link` as I stated
general 2021-03-21 04:31:06 Basically
general 2021-03-21 04:31:24 all player sees is vanilla game with post processing effects
general 2021-03-21 04:31:38 is like someone recorded screen and mod makers write on it
general 2021-03-21 04:32:35 The inverse is that the game exclusively looks for legal inputs (disallows things like 4000 clicks per second or 583 degree turns per tick)

the-dump 2021-03-22 03:17:03 Fun fact:

the-dump 2021-03-22 17:07:58 Yes

the-dump 2021-03-22 17:12:37 My interest in them is solely due to their tech
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:13:18 I predict in at most 500 years body modifications might start rolling out simply due to pull towards changing themselves
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:14:59 Like all it takes is a somewhat science orientated furry group forming an organization and that'd drive my estimations to around
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:15:13 90% chance for them to lead biomechanicals

the-dump 2021-03-22 17:17:44 Yes but once the tech is out there it'll cascade quite violently
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:18:49 My goal is simply

the-dump 2021-03-22 17:20:52 Way to think about it is

general 2021-03-24 15:52:53 I'd like to note that space sailors has infinite terrain generation for the moon
general 2021-03-24 15:52:58 So anyways

general 2021-03-24 16:51:25 How does one optimize animations past this
general 2021-03-24 16:51:38 I've got it down to effectively 2 if statements
general 2021-03-24 16:52:13 One of which turns off while the other is active
general 2021-03-24 16:52:30 Can't code language
general 2021-03-24 16:53:00 All I know is clickdetector and how to make a nonfunctional button
general 2021-03-24 16:54:32 Plans for ideas that cannot be made in scratch exceed the concepts provided by tutorials
general 2021-03-24 16:55:39 Well the main studio project is something that is effectively a very overcomplicated spawn system
general 2021-03-24 16:56:38 Involves a lot of unions being used in weird ways
general 2021-03-24 16:56:51 animations being interrupted but smoothly transitioning to another point
general 2021-03-24 16:57:21 somehow hiding the player and locking them to an animation but keeping the camera in a set position
general 2021-03-24 16:57:26 that stuff
general 2021-03-24 16:58:02 Studio project
general 2021-03-24 16:58:12 yes
general 2021-03-24 16:58:32 At end of school will try to model poorly with ms paint
general 2021-03-24 16:58:55 Because the thing I am currently working on is not the roblox studio project
general 2021-03-24 16:59:01 and it happens to be able to be done in scratch
general 2021-03-24 17:00:01 The scratch project is a 2D top down fighting game
general 2021-03-24 17:00:22 Currently I have
general 2021-03-24 17:00:34 1: A 10 frame hurt animation
general 2021-03-24 17:00:54 2: Something that draws text in the corner for finding bugs
general 2021-03-24 17:01:08 Yes but it can also be done in scratch
general 2021-03-24 17:02:52 I mean if you really prefer lua I can yanderedev a game together for you

general 2021-05-01 03:47:26 it appears roblox has issues with number filtering
general 2021-05-01 03:47:39 likely permits any single digit with a character after
general 2021-05-01 03:47:53 to prevent false positives like 6c
general 2021-05-01 03:48:04 but there is space
general 2021-05-01 03:48:31 perhaps it looks ahead to check for something like "6 degrees" and found "yo" to be something similar?
general 2021-05-01 03:48:50 Either way
general 2021-05-01 03:49:25 Hmm
general 2021-05-01 03:50:01 Ah

general 2021-05-01 03:51:01 Closest in server match to name
general 2021-05-01 03:52:41 Possible psychological benefit of filtering that
general 2021-05-01 03:53:01 gives them a second chance to analyze the thing they need consent for
general 2021-05-01 03:53:41 Though negatively impacting things such as notifying someone that you registered the presence of a fact
general 2021-05-01 03:55:45 If Yes and No are unfiltered then those were likely kept due to their widely used nature outside of being "I would like to notify you that I accept the request" such as "yes the filter is dumb but"

the-dump 2021-05-08 05:01:21 do you remember this video clip
of our robots working together using our
superior motion control?
the-dump 2021-05-08 05:01:45 If we didn't
impress you with that clip how about
this:
the-dump 2021-05-08 05:02:06 what do you say have you ever seen an
industrial robot moving with such
outstanding motion control as you can
see we've added another robot we've also
tightened up the tolerances
the distance between the cans and the
pin has been reduced to an impressive 1
millimeter and this isn't the limit of
the robot path accuracy it's the way the
cans are mounted on the tray how do we
get this fantastic motion by hours of
programming no way just program a path
of combined straight lines and circles
at normal slow programming speed
note the three robots moving together
when the programmer uses the joystick on
the teach pendant then run the program
in automatic mode up to full speed this
is our strength the path is speed
independent we show this by using the
manual speed control it's the same
program running no tuning needed what
your program is what you get
true mood for the best-in-class path
accuracy quick mood for the shortest
cycle times and you know what it's
delivered in all our robots as standard
superior motion control

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 15:51:43 Unless they have infinite reaction time they are immediately placed at disadvantage with fast turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 15:52:23 How to make cutters fair:

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 15:53:14 2: make them only do damage once they leave and re-enter the proximity of a recently damaged block

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:35:08 A dumb idea I was thinking about: Armor & Heavy Armor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:35:47 To prevent abuse of them, at certain levels they directly compromise the max strength of all systems
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:36:16 And even your bullets are stopped by them
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:37:24 Also this is the main point of heavy armor: it instantly destroys any cutters that attempt to damage it
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:08 Regular armor is generally immune to cutters but can still be damaged by about 10 seconds of grinding
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:41 Things that are compromised by too much armor:
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:52 If you don't have enough wheels then all wheels fall off
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:39:14 If too few motors holding up something then the motors break
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:39:26 Thruster force reduction

general 2021-05-17 20:21:58 Not exactly a limit
general 2021-05-17 20:22:18 savedata limit is the major cap
general 2021-05-17 20:22:49 it declines to save if you fill the limit
general 2021-05-17 20:23:49 Active blocks limit would require a bit of math
general 2021-05-17 20:24:04 I'm pretty sure there's enough 1x1x1s to fill the build area

the-dump 2021-05-20 17:08:49 also I got a better idea than a naval gun that would crack that tank in half

the-dump 2021-05-20 17:10:01 you put the pivot on a turntable
the-dump 2021-05-20 17:10:08 you put the turntable on another turn table

help 2021-05-24 13:31:51 if you reduce the points of contact from infinity squared to infinity by switching from a plane of contact to a line, lag is greatly reduced without leaving a seam.

plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:26:28 because motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:26:41 causes motor to jam itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:27:30 basically roblox physics says no
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:27:38 and obliterates the thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:28:02 craft cannot exist with locked motor

plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:28:28 craft self destructs with locked motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:28:46 craft self destructs with locked motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:29:03 is easier to keep the magnet system as it is far more durable anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:29:12 this is made to be a combat vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:29:31 even if motor lock worked all it takes is shooting one exposed block to tear it in half
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:30:25 adding one extra protective system through reworking the entire structure is more difficult than adding more magnets
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:30:47 magnets can weld too
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 21:31:26 fuck this I'm ignoring this conversation

plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:04:25 can't have a shredder bug if its fins tear off trying to turn while digging
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:05:41 any non cutter surface on the head shreds itself due to collision
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:06:18 that stupid shredder baseball bat thing would crack in half due to self applied stress
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:06:47 creation to ground collision would be a bit less fun but could work too
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:07:43 just once conditions are met
break welds
disable collisions
freeze when enough of the block intersects the ground
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:08:14 ooooo

plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:09:14 when traveling forwards at high speed it sticks into colliding things such as the ground or a chicken or a boat and probably breaks at high force for balance
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:10:25 basically just the crash damage system except it initiates on high speed and doesn't break the weld until the force condition is met

general 2021-05-27 19:01:57 If it has a10 gun it is a10
general 2021-05-27 19:02:20 it either is a10 or has an a10
general 2021-05-27 19:02:57 no
general 2021-05-27 19:03:07 several firing mechanism = several gun
general 2021-05-27 19:03:49 if it can shoot 2 bullets at the same time then it has 2 guns meshed, even if it only has one barrel
general 2021-05-27 19:04:16 if it can only do one at a time then it is one gun, even if it has 49 barrels
general 2021-05-27 19:04:46 Depends
general 2021-05-27 19:04:53 can the double barrel fire both at once
general 2021-05-27 19:05:03 if yes then it is 2 single barrel shotguns meshed
general 2021-05-27 19:06:29 If I tie 2 revolver triggers together are they one revolver then?
general 2021-05-27 19:07:32 if I put a rod on the triggers of 2 single barrel shotguns and use it as a single trigger is it then a double barrel shotgun
general 2021-05-27 19:07:39 there are 2 firing mechanisms
general 2021-05-27 19:07:43 2 chambers
general 2021-05-27 19:09:03 double barrel shotgun contains two storage spaces for a shell which can be discharged individually or together
general 2021-05-27 19:09:07 it is 2 guns glued together
general 2021-05-27 19:09:43 they function independently at all points except trigger
general 2021-05-27 19:09:58 a shoelace is a machinegun
general 2021-05-27 19:13:31 there are double barrel shotguns that have two triggers, one for each barrel
general 2021-05-27 19:13:41 is this not two guns?
general 2021-05-27 19:15:09 
general 2021-05-27 19:15:17 Hmm
general 2021-05-27 19:15:27 is this the one or
general 2021-05-27 19:16:06 Remove one hammer, is it still a gun or a broken gun?
general 2021-05-27 19:16:51 saw one barrel, is it now a half sawed off?
general 2021-05-27 19:20:45 or is
general 2021-05-27 19:20:48 Hmm
general 2021-05-27 19:20:52 due to construction
general 2021-05-27 19:21:05 it is actually two guns embedded into a specialized firing mechanism
general 2021-05-27 19:21:34 either one could work in its own mechanism but one designed to fire both was made for the two
general 2021-05-27 19:22:02 No its one trigger for two guns
general 2021-05-27 19:22:48 so tying 50 pistols together by the trigger in a way that they fire at once makes them one weapon?
general 2021-05-27 19:23:00 tie 2 bricks together to make a bigger brick?
general 2021-05-27 19:23:17 if you bridge a gap between mountains it is now one mountain?
general 2021-05-27 19:24:02 only connecting the triggers of the pistols
general 2021-05-27 19:24:09 only the surface of the bricks
general 2021-05-27 19:24:43 this is an ace attorney moment
general 2021-05-27 19:24:59 is cereal a soup?
is lava wet?
general 2021-05-27 19:25:23 nah
general 2021-05-27 19:25:50 fine then
general 2021-05-27 19:26:04 comparison of two objects containing barrels
general 2021-05-27 19:26:56 is mounting a solid rocket booster to a launch vehicle merging the rocket to the vehicle?
general 2021-05-27 19:27:15 are the rocket and vehicle now one?
general 2021-05-27 19:27:39 now is when it decouples when the rocket is spent considered the loss of a section of the rocket-shuttle??
general 2021-05-27 19:28:14 get better arguments than "do your stuff better"
general 2021-05-27 19:28:55 **then,**
general 2021-05-27 19:30:15 if you fuse two identical weapons together,
are their collective abilities to fire now only representable by the whole
general 2021-05-27 19:30:37 any linkage specifically
general 2021-05-27 19:31:14 specifying that they may be connected in a difficult to remove way but can still always be detached and repaired
general 2021-05-27 19:32:41 Actually technically it isn't one trigger
general 2021-05-27 19:33:02 its the ability to select triggers and interact through one main
general 2021-05-27 19:33:36 like stringing the trigger access into one selector that is then activated through a main
general 2021-05-27 19:33:55 ok new subject similar concept
general 2021-05-27 19:34:55 https://youtu.be/92WHN-pAFCs Is the creation of a single machine designed as two merged into one where the specification that it is two is clear indeed still impossible to define as two?
general 2021-05-27 19:36:00 even if the firing mechanism count is one
general 2021-05-27 19:36:54 Now for the next grade of definition
general 2021-05-27 19:37:01 chambers
general 2021-05-27 19:37:26 we must define a line at which point it becomes no longer a weapon
general 2021-05-27 19:38:46 is it still a firearm if you use the tool of a hammer to operate it
general 2021-05-27 19:39:21 is the bullet itself a firearm
general 2021-05-27 19:39:54 define shoot
general 2021-05-27 19:40:03 I could drop the bullet through the barrel
general 2021-05-27 19:40:11 and it exits at a moderate speed
general 2021-05-27 19:41:12 just a pipe holding a round the round activated by any force is a firearm?
general 2021-05-27 19:41:41 so if I take the break section of the break action double barrel
general 2021-05-27 19:41:57 and activate it by any means on one side
general 2021-05-27 19:42:15 and can still use it on the other
general 2021-05-27 19:42:37 is it not actually 3 firearms with one relying on the presence of the other 2?
general 2021-05-27 19:43:25 detaching the break action section presents a functional firearm and a nonfunctional firearm
general 2021-05-27 19:44:06 if the barrels are then split the nonfunctional can never be reused with the same now two functional individual firing weapons
general 2021-05-27 19:44:59 no material is added
general 2021-05-27 19:45:13 you just remove the less effective trigger
general 2021-05-27 19:46:02 I'm calm here
general 2021-05-27 19:46:16 just trying to get something other than "you're stupid" out of here
general 2021-05-27 19:46:52 This discussion has been dried out I need a new person
general 2021-05-27 19:47:36 If I take the barrels of the double barrel shotgun and split them, remove the original firing mechanism
general 2021-05-27 19:47:52 are they then two ranged weapons
general 2021-05-27 19:51:46 For me to make further points I'd need a bunch of guns to mess with
general 2021-05-27 19:52:24 I need to identify parts of the weapon that can be used to replace the firing mechanism and use the old mechanism split in half as two hammers
general 2021-05-27 19:52:53 I'd need two people that don't value their lives to individually load and fire rounds
general 2021-05-27 19:53:16 as proof that it can function independently
general 2021-05-27 19:53:57 best bet I can think of is using some sharp bits jammed into the stock as a way to trigger it
general 2021-05-27 19:54:28 Yes
general 2021-05-27 19:55:05 you take the firing mechanism and split it in half
general 2021-05-27 19:55:16 use the two halves as hammers for the two barrels
general 2021-05-27 19:55:40 no material added, just reconfigured into two guns
general 2021-05-27 19:56:50 you appear quite agitated
general 2021-05-27 19:57:01 would you like to end this?
general 2021-05-27 19:57:02 here
general 2021-05-27 19:57:06 you win, congrats
general 2021-05-27 19:57:31 double barrel shotgun is single weapon until changed into something completely different

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:06:22 I do not like merging blocks unless required
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:06:34 I can work with paper thin wing so I do not motor lock half blocks on
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:07:09 mainly because I've seen many cases of both combat disadvantage and physics breaking down as a result
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:08:00 Ever heard of how all motor lock fixed itself so everyone was complaining

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:42:11 I'm looking for a design that can work with mixtures of slopes, literally every shape available in half blocks, while using absolutely zero space outside of the wing as it must have detailed indents and extrusions
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:42:53 This already multiplies the space required for motor lock exponentially
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:43:18 Theres more still but you can see why I want blocks and half blocks that can function as wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:45:08 Because I physically cannot proceed with nonstationary air vehicles until either motor lock breaks the first logic rule in plane crazy of no intersecting blocks in build mode or a wing panel that isn't made of paper is made

general 2021-06-26 10:52:11 aka letting them lag the server
general 2021-06-26 10:52:52 Am thinking about something
general 2021-06-26 10:53:01 an "inverse blacklist"
general 2021-06-26 10:53:28 where the creation is completely unloaded while in build mode
general 2021-06-26 10:53:59 the fact that there are other people in the server
general 2021-06-26 10:54:12 and that if the lagger is determined enough they can follow you across servers
general 2021-06-26 10:54:59 Lagging person can just join another server too
general 2021-06-26 10:55:08 lag another cluster
general 2021-06-26 10:55:17 they don't need to build the machine each time
general 2021-06-26 10:55:33 just a few clicks and boom no fun for anyone
general 2021-06-26 10:56:32 vip servers come with built in lagmachines called
general 2021-06-26 10:57:11 folding creations
general 2021-06-26 10:57:37 if this inverse blacklist existed those wouldn't lag either
general 2021-06-26 10:58:53 its literally just another button on the blacklist menu "Unload this person's creation while in build mode"
general 2021-06-26 10:59:04 fixes all lagmachines intentional and unintentional
general 2021-06-26 11:00:18 Both could work
general 2021-06-26 11:00:36 but is most effective when person is deployed and you are build mode
general 2021-06-26 11:01:19 which is why it is most effective when person is deployed and you are build mode
general 2021-06-26 11:02:27 you cannot be attacked in build mode
general 2021-06-26 11:02:37 and because it uses the blacklist you have the blacklist cube
general 2021-06-26 11:03:31 Under ANY circumstance when you are in build mode while a person is blacklisted and the option is checked, they do not exist to you
general 2021-06-26 11:03:59 That is the full extent of the anti lag
general 2021-06-26 11:04:18 it also helps by censoring inappropriate creations
general 2021-06-26 11:04:36 they literally do not exist to your client when you are in build mode so no

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 01:17:27 It is of the time that I remind all of you to respect the deceased peoples, they do not lose their rights of respect upon death.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 01:22:42 Additionally, I do not wish to call you out for any lies as I trust your claims,
Those that falsify the death of loved ones for empathy deserve never to receive such for the continuation of their life for only in their death may they be judged for their truths. The lowest of earth shall receive no respect for me, do not take this moment as a note of ability to abuse me as if you are found out I will charge back for my kindness with payment of blood.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 01:24:38 Then I will simplify by restating the most important
Do not take this moment as a note of ability to abuse me as if you are found out I will require repayment for my kindness in the form of blood.

general 2021-07-09 16:31:13 minimod rule is weird
general 2021-07-09 16:32:46 There's multiple ways for something to be excessive, I'd say I've been a bit excessive at times but have not been warned for it
general 2021-07-09 16:33:22 So I believe what the rule means is "No confrontational minimodding"
general 2021-07-09 16:34:01 Don't start arguments and bother people to yell at a minor rule being broken
general 2021-07-09 16:36:52 Also why obc on phone so much now last I remember they were almost always on pc
general 2021-07-09 16:37:19 Did something happen to the device?
general 2021-07-09 17:03:22 Yay I actually had a good idea
general 2021-07-09 17:06:04 Just had an idea for how logic gates could work
general 2021-07-09 17:06:34 Multiple button inputs and outputs
general 2021-07-09 17:06:46 Top row is inputs
Bottom row is outputs
general 2021-07-09 17:07:05 Click center box to cycle between things like and, or, xor, nor, etc
general 2021-07-09 17:07:42 when conditions of center box are met with input row inputs, the block will simulate you pressing every key listed in the outputs row
general 2021-07-09 17:08:12 Would you prefer there only being an and gate
general 2021-07-09 17:08:32 the center box lets you choose the conditions for the output to fire
general 2021-07-09 17:09:10 though yes it would generally be helpful to also have things like nor, xor, and xnor
general 2021-07-09 17:09:49 compacts all logic systems by quite a bit
general 2021-07-09 17:10:02 I'm trying to say
general 2021-07-09 17:10:29 
general 2021-07-09 17:11:20 when all input buttons are pressed, fire output
general 2021-07-09 17:11:55 I'm just unsure if this is already suggested so am putting here
general 2021-07-09 17:12:26 bruh there's 0 reason to deny it
general 2021-07-09 17:12:40 there is nothing in the game that lets you automate pressing keybinds
general 2021-07-09 17:13:12 if logic gates are supposed to only be doable through mechanical things
general 2021-07-09 17:13:29 then sensors to take the mechanical output and convert to keybind
general 2021-07-09 17:13:48 you just
general 2021-07-09 17:14:09 instead of making blocks look for a key, they look for a signal from something that recieves keypresses
general 2021-07-09 17:14:13 painting 1 sec
general 2021-07-09 17:18:09 
general 2021-07-09 17:18:57 If denied then alternative 1 sec
general 2021-07-09 17:19:31 That are unable to send keybind outputs
general 2021-07-09 17:19:48 Alternative: sensor
general 2021-07-09 17:20:11 And denied for absolutely no reason
general 2021-07-09 17:20:39 there is less reason to deny it than there is for logic gates
general 2021-07-09 17:21:19 it would do basically everything that everyone wants
general 2021-07-09 17:22:20 A button
Physical to keybind
Logic gates
Automatic non hover block hovers
general 2021-07-09 17:24:05 The only reasons I can come up with to deny logic gates are due to previous mistakes in plane crazy design
general 2021-07-09 17:24:20 code spaghetti and shredder bugs
general 2021-07-09 17:25:05 but I literally just made a graphic in like 2.5 minutes of how to do it
general 2021-07-09 17:25:20 you convert key presses into signals, multiple things can send these signals
general 2021-07-09 17:26:03 Not after the rewrite where supposedly the game is becoming less spaghetti
general 2021-07-09 17:26:19 the signals aren't processed in the keyboard
general 2021-07-09 17:28:20 I can simulate a keypress on scratch if you want that, it'd take me like an hour but that's because I also need to make blocks for the thing to communicate to
general 2021-07-09 17:28:53 If I had the materials I could probably take a few machine learning lessons and make an external program that simulates keypresses
general 2021-07-09 17:30:45 Though the easier way would be to just have the program have the logic gates
general 2021-07-09 17:31:45 That's if you want to use mechanical logic gates and convert it back into keypresses
general 2021-07-09 17:31:57 to have sensors
general 2021-07-09 17:32:15 and would probably need an alt account
general 2021-07-09 17:32:39 No, sensors are the second idea

4: Contact most relevant (If a mod has interacted with the relevant chat recently or requested for the relevant content to be sent to them)
5: Contact least inactive

general 2021-07-09 17:56:37 if you have sent a message within the last 10 minutes will be prioritized over do not disturb and online mobile mods
general 2021-07-09 18:00:38 Searching for more content

general 2021-07-09 18:28:53 Changing priority timer to 30 minutes
general 2021-07-09 18:40:15 Yes
general 2021-07-09 18:41:29 Discord needs a clearer way to represent activity
general 2021-07-09 18:42:56 maybe some form of indicator inside the online indicator
general 2021-07-09 18:44:37 when indicator is set to online, are focusing their discord window, and are viewing the server you are looking at them from, a little outline lights up around their pfp in the member list
general 2021-07-09 18:45:08 an "active" indicator
general 2021-07-09 18:45:55 Online by itself is good for telling that they are using discord and want others to know about that and that they can be messaged freely
general 2021-07-09 18:46:25 but it does not show if they are just randomly tabbing in to discord and tabbing out
general 2021-07-09 18:47:01 or if discord just started in the background and they are doing something else
general 2021-07-09 18:51:18 This is big brain time
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 19:54:42 I think the reason the mass center indicator does this is because some of the wedge blocks don't properly report their mass
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 19:55:31 Or perhaps material weight is calculated on load but not while actually building

general 2021-07-11 02:49:30 A bee sleeping on a flower is not a meme it is a fun fact
general 2021-07-11 02:50:04 if it severely disrupts the chat then it would likely qualify as 'similar posts'
general 2021-07-11 02:50:29 If one person gets absolutely triggered by the bee and disrupts the chat that's its own thing
general 2021-07-11 02:50:44 I am fine with the presence of a bee in general
general 2021-07-11 02:51:30 I am fine with light minimodding as it helps mods
general 2021-07-11 02:52:06 I am not fine with minimodding that completely disrupts chats
general 2021-07-11 02:52:40 My minimodding method does not interrupt chats as its just communication with mods through dms and a reserve for unanswered things
general 2021-07-11 02:53:17 If they are using exploits then devs get involved

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:25:44 
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:16:56 requires a lot of space
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:18:01 plus when premade like that it can be used for compact corridors
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:19:09 say I required a wall of wing panels lining the interior of something
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:19:16 I now require
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:20:13 1: the support structure for the motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:20:30 2: the motorlock itself in a way that exposes none to the interior
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:20:37 3: the wall of wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:21:17 is more painful to set up than motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:21:34 armor
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:21:38 is not paint block
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:22:23 also paint block creates seams
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:22:44 fireworks do zero damage to literally default material 1x1x7
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:23:12 4: the other part of the armor

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:23:56 do you not know what happens to anti minge turrets when they are unarmored
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:24:05 instantly destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:24:19 then you must dispose of your firework weapon
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:24:46 requires its own keybind
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:25:48 currently have my structure set to only need one key press, as it is strategic in some situations to not press it, I would need to assign a second button, this would then double keypresses
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:27:27 also I disapprove of the use of motorlock in my creations, see the unintentional bugfix event
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:28:58 motor set to locked is not used in my create because not stable
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 18:30:10 the reason for this is out of spite because motorlock broke my mech before it was erased

general 2021-07-15 22:14:43 if its worse than the original then it isn't a copy its a downcycle

general 2021-07-17 05:33:59 you make a weakpoint in the tank that then somehow explodes

the-dump 2021-07-18 23:58:37 I once had so many tabs
the-dump 2021-07-18 23:59:01 there were over 2x the amount of tabs than could fit on the bar
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:38 Torps are for the strike group that go around the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:04:01 it would be pointless to put them on the carrier as they may hit a friendly in the group
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:04:34 Can't remember which one has the torps but probably the attack submarines
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:05:27 Though the idea of torps inside a cluster of ships gives me an idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:05:35 what about an inverse mortar
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:05:46 something that fires downwards underwater and floats to the surface
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:06:39 Current plan for hallways is
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:08:07 There appears to be one record of a carrier being destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:08:09 However
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:08:37 There was also found to be a fake carrier made for propaganda by destroying it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:09:30 
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:10:42 I have found 2
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:11:36 12 fires
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:12:05 though only few were large enough to do actual damage
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:19:42 CIWS is useful because things attacking from equally long range can be shot down or their projectiles shot down
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:20:49 And fish don't travel for years without refuel
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:42 the main weapon of carrier is jet
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:51 the secondary is the strike group
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:56 the third is the CIWS
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:22:14 the forth is the people inside
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:00 did you know that modern aircraft carriers exist
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:27:29 primary is plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:27:42 secondary is boats around
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:28:15 tertiary is people and gun mounts
general 2021-07-19 00:42:11 I wonder if you can complain to youtube about someone slandering a community

the-dump 2021-08-06 08:31:33 Sort thieves by weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:45:13 oo idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:45:58 all fuel consuming blocks perform slightly better when provided over quarter a tank of fuel
if a fuel consuming block is very close to a fuel block it will be supercharged
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:46:39 these benefits cannot be used in infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:48:32 when fuel block is damaged, emit lava particles in random directions at moderately low velocity with bias to downwards, slowly self damage, explode on destroy
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:48:54 actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:49:13 make fuel block out of 6 sections like paint block except sides cannot be individually painted
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:49:30 whichever sections are damaged start spraying fuel
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:49:52 I mean they are active rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:50:05 but probably on another server

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:38:58 which confuses me because it doesn't even need to interact with the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:39:03 its completely detached
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:39:43 all interaction it has with the current game is
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:40:02 click a button next to someones name in the blacklist box
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:40:10 click confirm or deny
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:40:22 if confirm, everybody else has x time to vote
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:40:35 if vote no then you are unable to vote again for x time
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:40:55 if yes, the target is barred from the specific server
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:41:20 near-zero interaction with current hardcoded elements

plane-crazy 2021-08-11 19:20:47 anti pen is using very small blocks or weaves of blocks to make it harder for targeted damage to get through

creations-chat 2021-08-13 20:21:14 To get a good score in <#384025409945337856> you must design something that meets one of the following:
Achieves a record (Speed, Least of X, Most Y carried without hindering Z)
Looks really cool (Many ways to achieve this)
Looks very accurate to something
Has an absurd amount of motor lock (The use of motors with lock enabled to place blocks in places they usually are not allowed in)
Good photography (Don't just put 5% of the creation in frame)
Meme (May result in warn)
Misc (The people of PCC are weird and may randomly upvote something)

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:59:44 you need 3 hands to fly this thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:00:26 oh and missiles are in 4 groups so you need to be cycling keys 1 through 4 while holding left click and aiming with wsad (and possibly dodging the enemy with arrow keys, + and -, and 5 to output the most damage
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:02:01 that means you need one hand for wsad 1234, one hand for up down left right 5 + and -, and one hand for the mouse

the-dump 2021-08-17 00:47:19 means that a wink is covered even a tiny bit by another wink. You can, however, play the top wink of any pile if it is yours and follow through to any wink directly under it.[6] [7]
the-dump 2021-08-17 00:47:42 - If someone pots out, the time limit no longer matters. The game continues until all winks of a partnership are in the pot. All squops must be squidged. Covering winks are moved to 2mm away from all other winks. Play continues in the regular order. First color to pot out wins.
the-dump 2021-08-17 00:48:01 - To play a squopped wink, you first play the upper surface of the unsquopped wink. Winks vertically below the wink you first touch can be hit by the squidger. The shot has to be short and continuous from start to finish. You could play a pile shot in which you send the enemy wink far away. This is called a boondock.

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:23:25 where you have firefox is being stuoud
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:27:00 you take 2 sets of wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:27:23 link them together so they pivot freely but are set distance apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:27:38 and then in the center of that link connect both train cars together
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:27:52 what this does is
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:28:12 as both sets of wheels make the turn the train cars meet at the average between the wheel sets
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:28:28 so they can take sharper turns without imploding
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:28:46 lemme make a video of my train dedicated to this concept 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:31:19 which this avoids
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:32:07 sadly however it takes vertical space but this cost can be reduced with motorlock

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:48:45 these would be better stored in settings

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:59:59 I didn't ask for you to respond with hatred either
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 01:00:21 you need to learn to fucking ignore irrelevant things
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 01:00:47 you appear to be rather agitated
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 01:02:03 and you think by putting them into suggestions they would receive a better response?

general 2021-08-20 01:25:36 the major thing I like about plane crazy is that it requires people to build realistically
general 2021-08-20 01:25:58 so you can't just have 100 plates smashed together creating impenetrable armor
general 2021-08-20 01:26:37 its also why I dislike excessive application of motorlock
general 2021-08-20 01:27:15 motor lock in its current state is just a tool being abused, the detail gained is negligible until its abuse is resolved

general 2021-08-20 01:28:55 is not fair for pvp
general 2021-08-20 01:29:10 100 cutters in the same block released at once is not fair for pvp
general 2021-08-20 01:29:36 congrats you killed 2/3 of plane crazy, land and sea vehicles
general 2021-08-20 01:30:12 2/3 because theres a substantial number of shredder bugs that you seem to appreciate enough
general 2021-08-20 01:30:40 theres this thing called fucking caring about game balance

general 2021-08-20 01:31:09 fixing all problems by leaving does not fix anything it just kills the game faster
general 2021-08-20 01:31:46 no I'm trying to get pvp to be fair

general 2021-08-20 01:34:30 **Why do people want pvp to be unfair**
general 2021-08-20 01:34:36 **Why do people want the game to die**
general 2021-08-20 01:35:21 I've already got a suggestion that severely hurts them the next target is spam bombs and cutter nukes
general 2021-08-20 01:35:38 the game dies because you're telling everyone to leave
general 2021-08-20 01:37:01 the pvp must be fixed through motorlock being fixed through tnt being fixed, and once again this is not the removal of motorlock, rather the prevention of unfair application
general 2021-08-20 01:37:39 try to survive getting 100 tnt to the face
general 2021-08-20 01:37:40 do it
general 2021-08-20 01:38:37 simple, if an excess of intersecting tnt or cutters are found , the tnt is permanently debuffed, and the cutters have a temporary debuff
general 2021-08-20 01:39:19 its nerfing the abuse of motorlock to abuse tnt and cutters
general 2021-08-20 01:39:56 infinite fuel is good its the only way plane crazy has been played for some people
general 2021-08-20 01:40:08 people that put 100 tnt in the same place
general 2021-08-20 01:40:52 realistic bombs do not vomit out 100x their volume before exploding
general 2021-08-20 01:41:16 range abuse*
general 2021-08-20 01:42:02 the solution to this is to have a few smaller bombs instead of one spam bomb
general 2021-08-20 01:42:38 they would put the tnt closer together but not intersecting
general 2021-08-20 01:42:59 like the actual cluster of bombs is supposed to

the-dump 2021-08-20 02:45:55 I've got a solution to shredders
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:46:25 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/507673335816126509/846558532291919933
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:47:27 currently shredders are getting away with cutting things with the handle of a knife, when in reality it should do nothing
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:48:00 the point where it would do damage is when the cutter tip is driven directly into a block
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:48:37 best way to represent the cutter being driven into the block is to have multiple colliders
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:52:05 When traveling slowly, the left hitbox is used, a bump and some light damage, when traveling quickly, the right hitbox is used, if both prongs (extended for demonstration) are passed through before hitting the trapezoid then maximum damage will be given
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:52:50 Correct, you are not a part of the conversation.

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:43:55 No, I simply don't like dming mods when they're offline

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:45:40 My personal definition of minimod is someone who takes the time to assist mods, excessive minimod is trying to be the mods
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:48:50 Because y'all were targeting me and I didn't want it to turn into threats
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:50:25 I said that motor lock bombs are op
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 12:01:07 The series of attacks gave me a reason to believe the people hated the very concept of game balance.
More of a negative reaction than many years before when I had proposed a very stupid idea that would effectively remove all motorlock.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 12:03:55 2019 me was salty about my mech being broken after something changed resulting in it randomly phasing out of existence when moved, later had proposed something stupid that would break more things

the-dump 2021-08-22 12:17:33 This image is confusing me
general 2021-08-22 12:23:48 It would be nice if fuel gave a performance boost to things like propellers tho
general 2021-08-22 12:23:58 Currently fuel serves no purpose other than to limit
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:30:53 Stupid idea I typed up for no reason and won't suggest because it needs more refinement and dedication than I have rn:
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:30:58 Fuel mode: [Required/Partial/Boost/None]
Required: Fuel is necessary to be able to send signals to your creation
Partial: Fuel is necessary to operate specific blocks such as propellers
Boost: Fuel is necessary to operate your creation at the highest possible level, it may operate slower without
None: Fuel has no effect on the craft, no performance boost, fuel tanks do not explode
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:31:38 
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 12:39:56 I'm thinking
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:35:26 Hmm
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:35:46 Idea: Fuel blocks destroyed by explosives have a sort of "blast wave" effect
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:42:35 If an explosive block is next to a fuel block (on spawn, not when motorlocked together) its range is increased
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:43:39 an explosive can link to fuel in this range
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:43:54 fuel can only link to one explosive per block
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:44:20 fuel beams can link if 50% is in the link range
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:45:37 that should keep the '''realistic''' bomb makers happy
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:06 and technically it follows the same construction of a common nuke, a bunch of conventional explosives surrounding a core that combined create an intense explosion
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:20 and now the segment people get unhappy about
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:22 balance
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:48:54 to prevent you from spamming this, there is an arming period of between 15 and 120 seconds depending on power
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:50:23 this arming time is multiplied exponentially by how many modified explosives are present on the creation, so 16 max nukes takes an hour to arm, but 2 takes 3 minutes

plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:37:12 Shredders rely on spinning cutters stupidly fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:37:23 no way that could ever be stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:37:43 with just cutters it uses up all the speed in a single collision
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:38:22 I have theories for a way to enhance shredder bugs but will not state them here as shredder users exist here.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:40:42 Currently there's 3 major types
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:41:02 Drills, nests, and bombs.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:41:14 Drills use spinning very fast to cut
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:41:25 Nests are big ol assemblies of death
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:41:38 turrets encased in multiple shredder heads
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:42:00 its like 6 cutters tied together with a pile of turrets in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:42:23 Bombs are self explanatory they go boom boom to damage things
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:44:00 The enhancement would add a 4th class, a hybrid between a specific class and something quite rarely seen.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:56:24 the sphere classes are convoluted and bad so they are ignored
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:40:00 And this is why pranks are not to be used as jokes, but attacks. Do not attempt to deceive someone with something seemingly very positive or negative as they may act upon that front.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:41:39 Because it appeared to be the best thing that ever happened in their life according to their happiness, assuming the best.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:42:31 Because you experienced the best moment of your life, perhaps held some resentment towards the old phone.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:42:58 person likely gives no fucks
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:43:27 except the many examples where people died or got severely injured
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:44:20 
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:45:29 I've got 8 more examples of deaths and many more of injuries
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:46:45 most of which are not a clean death either
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:47:55 people suffered during their last moments, regretting their actions, or regretting the actions of others
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:49:28 To conclude, when preparing a prank against someone you do not fully understand, prepare for anything including death.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:50:47 Well some people are inaccessible during the prank too
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:51:53 8th example a person committed suicide after being convinced that another person had when in fact they were perfectly fine.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:53:51 the second example shows that it doesn't even need to be that intense of a prank
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:56:16 a █████ and friends were egging a random house, the ████ had died due to gunshot wounds
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:56:53 Someone had the idea of trying to claim that pranks were ok because they're "mostly" harmless
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:57:38 and Russian Roulette only has a 1 in 6 chance of killing you
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:58:30 the people that didn't die all did things on a similar level to the 2nd instance except got lucky
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:59:21 each time a negative action real or fake is performed against someone you are asking the question "are you willing to retaliate?"
the-dump 2021-08-24 12:01:00 How bout the legal

general 2021-08-24 14:27:59 Also a lot of the accounts are silent
general 2021-08-24 14:28:14 the ones that spam minecraft ads are slow but still active

general 2021-08-24 14:29:32 They are one of two accounts that send really questionable files
general 2021-08-24 14:30:42 also this is just an index of those that still have the evidence in them

the-dump 2021-08-25 19:12:35 Robux giveaways are things that happen
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:13:53 1: Manage giveaway on trusted site
2: Legitimately execute giveaway
3: Robux must be distributed legally and must pass through official sites into the other account
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:15:03 The best way to complete #3 is to send a gift card
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:16:34 Sniper fails to completely neutralize threats
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:17:15 If changed furry dies they don't just become harmless goo, the goo is now a hazard as it will convert on contact
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:17:35 the best way to deal with it iirc is either
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:18:11 apply acid to goo to decontaminate areas where goo piles were found
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:18:25 or bring the specimen as a whole to an incinerator
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:19:43 latex is just a rubber, it can be destroyed through ways that destroy any other rubber material
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:20:47 at high temperatures it self ignites, when placed in the right type of acid, bacteria, or enzyme, the rubber will break down on a molecular level
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:23:54 the main thing to worry about is ensuring that every molecule is destroyed, the best cycle of action I've determined is
incinerate
capture smoke in filter
dissolve filter in solution
place container of solution in solid rock cave
collapse exits
melt rock near exits to seal gaps between rocks
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:24:49 alternative to rock cave for singular units is to enclose them in airtight titanium boxes welded shut
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:27:28 place boxes on stand (at least 1 foot high) in pit (at least 5 foot deep), fill pit with concrete, monitor site around pit 24/7, pit must be at least 25 feet above the water table and 1 mile from any known water sources
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:28:15 an important thing to note is the life cycle of the latex
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:29:22 they will occupy a host, without one, they will exist as a blob and 'hibernate', the maximum duration a blob can exist in hibernation for is unknown but likely limited
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:29:47 If you ensure the blob is trapped they will eventually starve.
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:31:11 the last thing humanity needs is the risk of the remnants of the creatures contaminating the water

plane-crazy 2021-08-26 18:03:17 Why do tutorials even exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 18:03:34 the purpose of the game is to build your own stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 18:03:45 not copy paste someone else's things
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 18:04:28 I mean it sorta makes sense with pvp but barely
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:40:26 I see motorlock as the duct tape of plane crazy, a quick cheap fix to your mistakes and a tool for whatever doesn't like being welded together
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:40:53 at the cost of it generally degrading the abilities of the craft
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:41:45 you basically trade external space for internal space
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:42:08 with conservative usage this is fine because its quite difficult to run out of space in a room
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:42:22 but with excessive it becomes a mess to try and build around
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 21:43:02 similar can be said about absence of lock if you want a very detailed interior

the-dump 2021-08-29 22:28:31 Its literally just red but darker

the-dump 2021-08-29 22:30:20 16,777,216 new colors are required for maroon to be not red
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:30:42 and that's just computational
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:31:06 you need infinity new words for colors as there's always another edge case

general 2021-09-26 01:17:59 Frozen nitro is much more difficult to ignite so that probably saved the person that moved them to the shed

general 2021-10-02 01:31:11 I'd say 3 missiles on one turret is bad unless it's like 75% of the build or if the missiles cannot all hit the same target about 25 blocks away
general 2021-10-02 01:32:13 75% as in, a majority of the build's mass is the turret and it appears as though said large turret is designed to operate with that level of pew

general 2021-10-04 01:50:25 It's still a conversion of momentum
general 2021-10-04 01:50:38 Relative to the orange portal the cube is flying at it
general 2021-10-04 01:51:01 So the blue portal would receive something identical to a cube being thrown at orange
general 2021-10-04 01:51:39 If blue were moving backwards, though the cube is perceived as being thrown, it would be like throwing something out the back of a car
general 2021-10-04 01:51:55 your throw cancels out your forward force to create less speed
general 2021-10-04 01:52:58 An interesting fun balance you can do with two portals is
general 2021-10-04 01:53:06 both point down
general 2021-10-04 01:53:13 one is above a cube
general 2021-10-04 01:53:36 if the portal is moved below the center of mass of the cube, gravity pulls the cube out the other portal
general 2021-10-04 01:54:14 I wonder if launching the portal at the cube and suddenly stopping before the center of gravity would cause the 1/4 thrown cube to be grabbed just enough to be taken

general 2021-10-16 06:07:29 I think it does old rocket tracking
general 2021-10-16 06:07:56 aka: any blocks near the rocket cause it to reroute to the mariana trench
general 2021-10-16 06:09:48 legacy rockets are just bad
general 2021-10-16 06:10:33 New is probably a bit more advanced than "if enemy block, turn x amount per tick towards block"
general 2021-10-16 06:11:21 legacy tracking is just
general 2021-10-16 06:11:45 If enemy block is in range
general 2021-10-16 06:11:58 If enemy block is in range
general 2021-10-16 06:12:31 If enemy block is in range
general 2021-10-16 06:12:45 If enemy block is in range
general 2021-10-16 06:12:52 Pick closest enemy block
general 2021-10-16 06:13:00 Turn x amount towards block
general 2021-10-16 06:13:15 this is why legacy missiles suck
general 2021-10-16 06:13:25 they will spiral around small targets
general 2021-10-16 06:14:10 Instead, new targeting likely employs a conical range of sorts
general 2021-10-16 06:14:40 if there is enemy block in like 15 degree cone facing direction of travel
general 2021-10-16 06:14:48 pick closest block or center of mass
general 2021-10-16 06:14:54 and adjust to that angle from a distance
general 2021-10-16 06:15:03 this allows the missile to actually lock instead of panic spiral
general 2021-10-16 06:15:52 because it gives time for any static to medium speed target within range to be hit
general 2021-10-16 06:16:10 previously even with static targets there is the issue of the range being too large for the missile's ability to turn

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 00:52:34 I've determined that this will be used as both a reactor and a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 00:55:48 Because it needs to be a gyroscope, it needs to spin fast (To stabilize)
Because it needs to spin fast, it must have a dampener (To not tear the attached craft apart)
Because it needs a dampener, its natural output is unstable (Roblox physics go brr)
Because of its unstable natural output, there is a bypass on the dampener (To get around roblox physics)
Because of this bypass, there must be a complex seal involving locking pistons and one locked motor (The locked motor is pushed out and the distance moved is countered by piston)

bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:39:58 Unknown cause, indescribable moderately game breaking bug
https://vimeo.com/648170635
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:40:23 Bug starts around 4:10
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:42:47 Currently known effects listed in order of occurrence:
Craft flickers
Craft disappears
Player loses head
Craft reappears
Craft becomes partially intangible exclusively to owner
Craft partially returns to normal
Craft fully returns to normal
After some time (beyond video end), game crashes (Additional images attached soon)
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:46:30 Bug is confirmed to be removed by:
Sufficient damage to craft
Bug may also be removed by:
Reset
Entering build mode
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:19 After some time
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:27 Error 260 appeared
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:45 And game crashed upon attempting to reconnect
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:50:01 My best guess is it has something to do with a 4 pronged cutter craft thing you can see bumping into me in the start, the glitch started moments after the craft touching me both times, the cutter craft also seemed to partially phase into my craft in normal gameplay, when attempting to toggle anchor on and off, the flickering occurred
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:54:46 A very bad error I kept seeing was something like "HumanoidRootPart is not a valid member of "Workspace Darmagon3""
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 05:50:18 l   m   a   o
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:23:26 My craft has:
No locked motor
About 15 or so unlocked motors
Anchor block(s)
About 15 or so pistons
One disconnector
12-24 suspension

From what I can tell the other person's craft has:
Multiple cutters
Explosives
Wheel blocks

They might be unrelated though
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:24:57 Also forgot to say this earlier
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:25:32 But I believe locked pistons when damaged crash your client
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:32:58 Conditions that were present at time of locked piston crash:
Alongside other locked pistons
Extended
Possibly under stress at time of lock
Under stress at time of break
Zero gravity
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:34:51 Unfortunately, all motors are used to turn something, there are some that can be removed without issue but shouldn't apply forces anywhere, and 4-8 that can be removed while compromising the central purpose of the craft
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:38:32 Its one of those weird things that may have been caused by anyone or anything
Restarted network many hours before time of glitch
Was being repeatedly attacked by weird 4 prong thing immediately before each glitch
Craft uses non-physics anchors in a more strategic weird way which may conflict with the non-vital motors or the PVP environment, flickering appeared to respond to anchor
Craft is designed not to ride on the wheels but to grind against the floor while being pushed by wheels, every exterior surface that goes to the ground is a wedge of some form

Don't provide real feedback
Discourage experienced creators

That should really get some better creations going

creations-chat 2021-11-26 20:47:11 The two experiences I've seen hars involved in were
a: treating a rank as a mark of total superiority
b: this
creations-chat 2021-11-26 20:49:37 Correct, the only two times I've seen a notable interaction involving the character provided, were centered on purely destructive action

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 20:55:01 Though untested, try using win+shift+s to get a piece of sky, and use a color picker website to select various colors from the image

general 2021-11-26 22:52:51 Should be easier to show work then if there isn't any need to use a camera
general 2021-11-26 22:53:32 I am having difficulty coming up with a good math problem as alternative
general 2021-11-26 22:58:16 I wonder what it would be like if there were

what would pvp be like there

the-dump 2021-11-27 18:21:08 The final solution
the-dump 2021-11-27 18:22:04 This way if they introduce some form of "stop being a furry day" everyone will remain equal, placing everyone on the same level as previous furries

the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:03 The issue is
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:19 By asking the question you call out to each individual person to make a decision for all others
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:34 The better option would be an anonymous vote
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:20:42 As with that, people only see the most popular choice, and people feel comfortable voting for a time that works for them as if people say otherwise then the opinion is discarded without any penalty to the voter

general 2021-12-05 01:12:03 Here's an idea: The "Go away" list
general 2021-12-05 01:12:43 When you enable it on someone, their creation is hidden from view
general 2021-12-05 01:13:06 Can be combined with Blacklist to basically remove that person from your experience

the-dump 2021-12-05 02:45:06 So that

the-dump 2021-12-05 02:46:19 This bugged out, causing the two weld points to go together, creating the half block movement
the-dump 2021-12-05 02:46:33 This was then fixed by Roblox
the-dump 2021-12-05 02:46:47 This was then re-broken by rijcke because people were having a meltdown

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:03:52 When you want to play Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:00 So you start Roblox
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:08 But Roblox wants you to sign in
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:13 So you sign in
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:27 But then it wants a verification code sent by email
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:37 So you start email
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:43 But email wants you to sign in
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:04:47 So you sign in
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:05:00 But then it wants a verification code sent by text
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:05:13 So you get phone
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:05:22 And input code
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:05:26 And input code
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:05:42 And now you can proceed to Plane Crazy

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 01:55:06 Viewing ports on this level are not very good for spotting but good enough for firing through
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:00:01 Construction logic
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:00:32 Every piece of secure interior must have something below it capable of handling the weight

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:43:02 It demonstrates how, to enter the perimeter watch, you must remain in a firing field for extended period of time
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:43:29 If Plane Crazy was a game that supported player combat then this would be very effective
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:46:46 a compound dedicated to defense on all levels

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:50:04 This entire **area** is expendable
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:50:27 If it is obliterated, all survivors just move further into the structure

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:51:49 When completed, the survivability of zones will be calculated, the ones of lowest survivability will be rigged with explosives
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:54:18 the exterior is designed to be unclimbable, unfortunately this severely limits decorative options
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:54:33 it is flat except for the firing ports

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:56:57 maybe even less than 5%
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:57:36 what 'portion width'
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 02:59:05 Goal for weapon is
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 03:00:14 Interchangeable rapid fire - burst - semi

general 2021-12-25 00:44:45 3: Use this information to click every not already revealed safe tile, and place a flag on any mines (Flag function not present) to win
general 2021-12-25 00:45:19 If a mine is clicked, the game ends and a new board must be created

bot-central 2021-12-25 09:13:31 Tip for minesweeper, if there is an arrangement such as:
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:14:43 Because 7 of 8 areas are confirmed to be safe, the top left square must be a mine according to the 1 in the center of the image
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:18:06 The more safe tiles unlocked around a tile, the more you know about the unknown center
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:20:30 Ahem
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:21:19 As you can see, the goal here is to learn more about the 7 covered tiles before making a guess
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:22:10 If complete tiles were ordered with 1 being top left and 15 being bottom right
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:22:30 Then tile 5 can be determined to be a mine because of the cornered 1 in tile 3
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:23:23 Because tile 5 is a mine and tile 9 is a 2, the only place for the other mine to be is tile 11
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:23:56 so now, the task is to identify the remaining 2 mines in the 3 tiles available
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:24:03 that is how minesweeper works
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:24:41 try it for yourself, all images have been taken from this game, I've tried to minimize the ability to use them for cheating but you could if you really tried

general 2021-12-28 06:52:03 I still think the blacklist box should be a solid cube covering the plot
general 2021-12-28 06:52:23 That way there is zero chance of something getting in because there is no 'in'
general 2021-12-28 06:53:00 I mean maybe with excessively complicated motorlock but that doesn't help the enemy

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:39:55 'experts are nice' the experts claim
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:40:09 while also being toxic at all times towards anything not motorlocked
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:42:20 Imagine not liking something 'because its blocky' in a game with a half player size building grid
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:42:55 it is not simpler than without
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:44:59 I prefer simpler creations, I could motorlock a cart on suspension so it moves smoothly across the rail, or I could let gravity push the cart down
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:45:55 No motorlock required if the goal is to build blocky too
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:46:37 There's plenty of wedges to play with too
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:46:49 h a l f w e d g e
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:48:04 triangles - half wedge
half blocks - half wedge, half wedge 2, half wedge down, half wedge up, half wedge down 1x2, half wedge up 1x2, half block wedge
...
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:49:02 then go use your motorlock with your fixed mindset
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:49:12 make a new wedge
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:49:22 to fit your strict shape requirements
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:49:27 instead of just changing the shape
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:50:10 When I find wedges cannot solve the problem, I change the problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:50:53 'make the build inaccurate'

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:51:24 Imagine needing a guide to go off of
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:53:30 There are many things that can work without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:54:24 For example:

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:01:27 its function is to be a fully controllable torso
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:02:37 It rotates at the coupling here
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:02:50 There is a V2 in development that will be slightly more advanced
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:04:03 The critical flaw with motorlock is if anybody can see you in build mode they will know your weakpoints
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:04:23 and its quite difficult to hide a mech of max height
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:04:42 especially now that it doesn't exist anymore
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:05:25 you can see it all connect to the tower and funnel down to the motor

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:09:00 what type of combat vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:09:11 shredder sphere and shredder are countered by a different solution
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:09:46 then I would also be closing distance
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:10:40 Air to air combat plan is to use the self destruct system to take down the enemy, use that time to restart the battle with a quick respawn, repeat until they stop attacking
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:11:20 Alternative solution is to trick them into attacking an air mine
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:12:21 If self destruct does not stop attack, use air mine
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:13:04 If air mine is not attacked, use plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:13:34 air mine is a device that operates with gravity control
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:13:46 its a bunch of items loaded to plot
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:14:30 The goal is not to win a fight, my goal is to make the enemy think they've won and move on
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:15:22 The fight has 2 outcomes, they give up or they claim that I'm annoying and give up
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:16:00 I love tricking shredders into touching the air mine
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:16:24 absolutely obliterated, sometimes half the mine stays active
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:16:40 then it isn't a shredder its just a gun
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:17:03 
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:18:45 Conclusion: Nobody wins when they try to use minmaxed shit on me
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:19:23 I ensure that you won't enjoy the fight and will be distracted long enough to not bother the other people
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:20:14 I make fair fight vehicles, if the vehicle is made for combat it will have a moderately visible seat attached
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:21:11 There was an abandoned project a while ago dedicated to hiding the seat perfectly
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:21:57 in a different fucking build
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:22:04 you know I have this thing called save slots
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:22:21 that's where the drone and mine comes from
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:23:52 the abandoned project focuses on perfectly hiding the seat, was abandoned because why would you even bother targeting the seat
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:27:15 Mildly
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:27:39 They have been reduced to packing peanuts due to the new things
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:28:09 shredder spheres are common but also very weak
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:28:22 they're glass cannons after all
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 16:32:02 A fun little side effect is that if you have a building that is anchored and doesn't use motorlock, people tend to not attack

plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:01:40 A thing has been made by the he
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:02:15 They're designed in two types
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:02:35 One of the types reduces fps, mostly useless
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:03:09 The other slows server physics, ruins most experience with the game, but lets you walk up to their plot to nab their username
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:03:46 There's also rope lagmachines
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:04:00 not sure which goal they go for
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:04:21 the most classic machine is simply a load of loose parts in a box
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:05:22 most effective I've seen was a rope machine but it was made to not go everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:05:56 it just had ropes connected to something that moved really fast between two points
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 08:06:16 not sure how it worked but it was like ping of 10000 or smth

plane-crazy 2022-02-05 00:40:29 glue an anchor onto it somewhere, anchor craft whenever they try to fling
the-dump 2022-02-05 05:02:00 what would the reverse be
the-dump 2022-02-05 06:22:22 you will repeatedly have moments where you go 'why is the disconnectors here- oh right'
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:27:48 Complicated arrangement of aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:28:43 Assuming the 'forward' pitches in a way that points the seat downwards
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:29:02 And that the 'upward' causes the blades to angle
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:30:11 during upward motion, the blades do provide resistance in the direction of rotation, if there were one blade then the helicopter would wobble from this force and the imbalanced rotor
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:30:31 this force is countered by there being multiple blades
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:30:40 there is a second resistive force being gravity
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:31:34 as you tilt the helicopter with the forward input, while the blades are angled, the force of gravity is uneven on the rotor
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:32:02 causing that first upward resistance to try to spin the helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:33:38 this is not the first thing to check for however
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:33:43 the things to check for are
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:34:14 1: is the helicopter's center of mass to the right or left of the center of symmetry
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 08:34:59 2: is any 'lift' device to the left or right and not matched on the other side
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:06:00 Actually have seen before
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:06:16 Is basically shredder sphere but the spinners are removed
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:06:49 Just the motion arms with single cutters in place of the spinners
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:07:38 About as effective as an early shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:09:18 Weaknesses: Explosions, Cutters, Laser (Inline)/Narrow Cone (Spinning)/Multi-turret gun arrangements (Anything besides spread out fixed guns)
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:10:54 Speed: 4 propeller small craft
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:11:45 Damage: 1-2 fixed cutters per collision, at most 4 collisions per second
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:12:11 Oh and explosive self destruct
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:12:21 That's usually the only part that breaks something
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 09:13:12 And even then because they bounce around off of surfaces, the explosive is usually about 3-5 blocks away from any enemy

plane-crazy 2022-02-06 20:22:43 I prop mine up against the weird legs of the monitor stand I'd say its on a slope of around 30 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 20:35:58 Most overcomplicated mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 20:36:16 
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 20:37:19 A panel that hinges about 45 degrees using the force of a rope

creations-chat 2022-02-06 22:49:55 I mean it would give any rat nests a bad day as every surface suddenly rotates 45 degrees, dumping the nest onto likely fast moving train wheels

general 2022-02-09 01:14:58 me - 'shredder bugs and lag machines are bad and moderation is too crap to do anything about it, add votekick'
all - 'no'
various people many months or years later - 'shredder bugs are bad and moderation is too crap to do anything about it, add votekick'
all - 'yes'

general 2022-02-10 02:16:14 fun fact: sign filtering is intelligent
general 2022-02-10 02:16:56 Type any single number and letter into a sign ex: 'a2'
general 2022-02-10 02:17:26 If that text is not filtered, copy that sign into multiple other signs, suddenly it gets filtered
bug-reports 2022-02-14 02:57:47 I think the lag might be because of whatever remains of the broken thing that makes people say "<--- scammer"

the-dump 2022-02-20 11:31:46 you had to imagine the sentence though
general 2022-02-23 10:06:36 they are very simple to create, just remember to make shape of wrench when connecting them

the-dump 2022-03-07 22:38:28 I still think there needs to be 'conditional servers' for specific things
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:38:41 probably would never be used tho
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:39:08 Probably already suggested by another person
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:39:38 ex:
'cutters disabled' PVP conditional server
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:39:53 Cutters just don't work in that server
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:46:24 then in that specific gamemode the missile would fail
the-dump 2022-03-07 22:46:49 cutter would still be a block, it just wouldn't damage anything
the-dump 2022-03-08 23:28:32 Math teachers running out of 'real life examples' be like

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 14:42:24 Still don't know why pvp servers are restricted
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 14:42:43 it doesn't prevent people following you around

general 2022-07-05 20:27:03 Increasingly angry with the sign filter
general 2022-07-05 20:27:38 I just want a number on a sign
general 2022-07-05 20:28:14 The worse part is that it seems to react to multiple similar signs
general 2022-07-05 20:28:42 like if you have 'line a' and 'line b' it doesn't work but you can have one of either
general 2022-07-05 20:29:26 if they are in the plane crazy discord and
general 2022-07-05 20:30:07 theoretically could have been a poorly made plot to use build steal exploit

plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:48:07 take any creation not already shaped to have no material
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:48:18 bucket it to some color,
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:48:47 observe response
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:49:18 there are some ways to have flat color be beneficial such as in minimalist or illusion creations
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:55:48 I believe if that train and car were painted solid black plastic it might still be positive simply because its a steam train and <#384025409945337856> is weirdly biased

plane-crazy 2022-11-11 00:59:50 if you cant put something to look at in a boring looking area, color is relied on
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 01:00:58 motor lock is simple at core, but always ends in massive chains of locks, springs, and other weird things
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 01:01:39 the unlocked builds are also simple, but the creations field sees it as too simple
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 01:02:34 what is it even supposed to be
