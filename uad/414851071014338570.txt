plane-crazy 2020-06-24 08:55:33 Anyone know how many types of pontoons there are?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 08:55:40 Is it just middle and front

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 09:27:45 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 09:28:41 I'm assuming it's more laggy right?

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 10:24:01 Man I wish they added different types of weapons, stuff like cannons n whatnot
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 17:53:30 Haven't shredders been banned?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 17:53:45 When are they going to do something to get rid of them
general 2021-04-02 14:22:16 Anyone know if there's actual gold?
general 2021-04-02 14:22:31 Where
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:02:04 Are they ever going to do something about shredders and blacklist abusers?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:02:16 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:02:43 Bruh what?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:02:51 Hell am I supposed to do?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:04 Aim nice one

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:18 Nice one
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:31 I can't tell which one has the player on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:42 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:44 Wow
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:55 Easier said that done pal
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:03:59 Hahah just kill them not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:06:27 Them being "easy" to kill is besides the point
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:06:45 They're so annoying when you're trying to have a ship battle or a dog fight
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:06:53 And some prick in a shredder comes and ruins it all
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:07:19 Thats
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:07:20 What
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:07:28 No it's just annoying when you're trying to focus on a fight
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:07:39 And all of a sudden you got a neon green shredder up your ass
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:07:57 Yeah that'll make it worsr
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:12:32 Why ship battle when you can build guided torpedoes and stuff them inside a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 18:31:04 Is there any way to actually stop motor wobble
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 18:31:32 I can't make a proper offroader because the motors wobble like an 80 year old with Parkinson's
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 18:32:22 Uh kinda
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 18:32:26 Its a double wishbone suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:34:13 Am I the only one who thinks the new jet engine design doesn't look like it belongs in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:34:52 Like don't get me wrong it looks cool as hell but still, it's really detailed in a low detail game
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:35:08 Hopefully yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:35:21 Just praying my crappy little laptop can run it
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:35:56 A20 warthog

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:42:37 In the new map they better have big roads for driving
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:42:45 And river systems
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:42:50 And off-road trails
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:42:54 And race tracks
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:43:05 Basically they better add everything imaginable
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:43:45 Yeah with quicker loading times, they should let us build bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:44:17 Naw because it won't all be loaded at all times
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:44:25 Kinda like it is now depending on your graphics settings
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:48:47 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:49:13 No because
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:49:20 It's just a road n stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:49:26 Nothing ground breaking
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:06:49 Armor penetrating penetrator
