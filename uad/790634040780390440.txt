creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:38:02 they look more like blocks you forgot to delete. also, this blueprint says there will be two, angle locked braces but there is only one brace to be seen.
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:42:42 <@!617498718417190943> the supporting structure in the middle is too thick.
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:45:59 add some braces in an x pattern along the wings with trails or text
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:48:35 This is how thick it should be
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:53:13 <@!617498718417190943> also the jet turbines are too small, angle lock them
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:57:43 3 hours of motorlocking didn't even get you one upvote so you should probably change something
creations-chat 2022-01-07 02:14:32 nice. F15?
creations-chat 2022-01-07 02:39:11 because you have to wait 2 or 3 seconds for the pistons to lock

creations-chat 2022-03-12 03:14:26 <@!781206492187590656> The boat looks ok but I would like it if you used trails or text to make the antenna thing thinner and rather than putting a half block, put a half cylinder.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 03:17:48 <@!759950162549538826> please just try in your builds ☠️
