general 2023-07-19 22:22:14 why is the most common jet to me the F14
general 2023-07-19 22:28:40 i have seen very few people pull off a sweep wing jet
general 2023-07-19 22:29:54 I have barley seen any F4s
general 2023-07-19 22:32:17 i love when i kill people in pvp sometimes they say "well your in a tutorial" even though im not
general 2023-07-19 22:32:43 idk why it would matter if its a tutorial anyway
general 2023-07-19 22:36:01 shredders bugs are an obsolete weapon
general 2023-07-19 22:36:35 i kept killing a noobs box car in my tank so he pulled a shredder and i killed it 3 times without dying
general 2023-07-19 22:37:37 even omni shredders can be defeated by a good pilot
general 2023-07-19 22:37:41 not a great pilot
general 2023-07-19 22:37:43 a good
general 2023-07-19 22:38:32 i remember someone started venting that jet users were worse than shredder users
general 2023-07-19 22:43:17 Godzilla had a stroke reading this and fricking died
general 2023-07-19 22:47:43 i try to have minimal motor lock on my combat jets but on my "nice jets" ill use more
general 2023-07-19 22:49:56 A10 is also one of the most overdone jets
general 2023-07-19 22:50:13 and its shocking how many people use them as fighters
general 2023-07-19 22:50:39 nice

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:41:13 roblox spent too much money suing people exposing them for child predators instead of on their own servers
