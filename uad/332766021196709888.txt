bot-central 2019-08-09 01:21:04 &suggest  add a different type of saving called "part saving" where multiple of these can be loaded onto the players' plot. Simply put it, for example, the parts of a vehicle; chassis, body, engine could be saved separately and can be loaded onto the players' plot all at the same time.

bug-reports 2020-06-07 01:59:23 if Train Wheels are spawned backwards on the rails, then the controls do the opposite (go backwards when w is pressed)
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:00:45 they do exactly what they're supposed to do when spawned forwards
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:02:39 also in the build menu there's no space in-between Train and Wheel, but on every other block it is spaced properly
bug-reports 2020-06-10 10:59:04 the motors lock and reset configuration are incompatible with each other. it does lock but it doesn't reset. Not sure if it's supposed to be that way
general 2020-10-10 17:38:11 agree
