The Tale of blue_arrows (490923973131894804)
general 2021-03-26 05:01:24 Quick question, is Plane Crazy being plagued with build copy exploits, or something along those lines?
general 2021-03-26 05:01:52 I come from the Build a Boat for Treasure Community ^^... and we have an outbreak lol
general 2021-03-26 05:02:19 At least your devs are trying to fix the issue^^...
general 2021-03-26 05:03:12 We have this exploit where people can copy your builds and send it to hundreds of other players
general 2021-03-26 05:03:22 Mhmh
general 2021-03-26 05:03:40 ***our development team doesn’t care***
general 2021-03-26 05:03:51 IKR!
general 2021-03-26 05:04:44 I heard from the exploiting community that Plane Crazy has developed an anti copy thing, so I’m here to see if there’s anything we can learn from^^
general 2021-03-26 05:05:52 Your HoF looks really clean...
general 2021-03-26 05:06:00 Ours is a jumble lol
general 2021-03-26 05:06:21 :3 am in ours 9 or so times
general 2021-03-26 05:07:03 Wait.. since when were blocks able to be rotated...
general 2021-03-26 05:07:33 ;-;
general 2021-03-26 05:08:55 This is interesting...
general 2021-03-26 05:09:13 Our community hates military vehicles with a passion besides the builders^^...
general 2021-03-26 05:09:21 I have played it before occasionally
general 2021-03-26 05:10:06 I main build a boat mobile flight controls are a bit wonky, but expected
general 2021-03-26 05:11:07 Our game is more building, and less mechanics, so when we see something running as smooth as that, it’s rare, and amazi mg
general 2021-03-26 05:11:27 *but our devs don’t listen :333*
general 2021-03-26 05:11:48 I see...
general 2021-03-26 05:13:10 I’d definitely switch to Plane Crazy if build controls were more like BABFT
general 2021-03-26 05:14:18 Most of our community prefers Mechs, and or weird things
general 2021-03-26 05:14:31 You rarely see warships^^
general 2021-03-26 05:14:45 To me, they’re buttons on a screen
general 2021-03-26 05:14:55 Lol
general 2021-03-26 05:15:20 Y did you make a Yamato mech ;-;
general 2021-03-26 05:16:15 I can see this in Rio de Janeiro lol
general 2021-03-26 05:16:45 We really need more mechanics :<
general 2021-03-26 05:18:38 ***god, Should I switch?***
general 2021-03-26 05:19:13 Gl!
general 2021-03-26 05:19:33 Anyone knows someone named AmericaRules in this server?
general 2021-03-26 05:19:48 Nvm
general 2021-03-26 05:19:55 Forgot account names are mirror
general 2021-03-26 05:24:25 Is there a certain role needed for image permissions?
general 2021-03-26 05:24:51 *time to figure out how to get*
general 2021-03-26 05:25:17 I see!
general 2021-03-26 05:25:47 Makes sense, we have to make ppl get to lvl 5 lol
general 2021-03-26 05:27:51 *that’s how I feel*
general 2021-03-26 05:28:08 Rudderless jet
general 2021-03-26 05:28:17 Interesting ^^
general 2021-03-26 05:29:09 You do not want to see how poorly made Build a Boat’s “average” jets are
general 2021-03-26 05:29:27 People will slap on a delta wing, and call it a day
general 2021-03-26 05:29:47 Not even delta, straight wings
general 2021-03-26 05:31:18 I’m envious and questionable of this games build mechanics
general 2021-03-26 05:31:44 Simple blocks make building nicer looking things easier, but it doesn’t allow for complete freedom
general 2021-03-26 05:32:02 This games average build is far above our levels ;-;
general 2021-03-26 05:32:45 However, in build a boat, we have near complete control of our blocks... that’s a good thing for pros^^... but the skill gap is massive
general 2021-03-26 05:33:30 :3
general 2021-03-26 05:33:35 ^^
general 2021-03-26 05:33:41 We have more detail
general 2021-03-26 05:33:50 But you can actually use your builds
general 2021-03-26 05:34:03 Lol
general 2021-03-26 05:34:09 We have microblocks :3
general 2021-03-26 05:34:20 Let me send you a build a made last year
general 2021-03-26 05:34:34 Proportion?
general 2021-03-26 05:34:35 Wdym
general 2021-03-26 05:35:19 *that’s most people*
general 2021-03-26 05:35:27 *I’m not most people hehe*
general 2021-03-26 05:35:43 I don’t build cars
general 2021-03-26 05:35:48 I build better things
general 2021-03-26 05:36:17 Planes, warships, tanks
general 2021-03-26 05:40:23 Our community hates military builds, and adore neon spam for some reason
general 2021-03-26 05:41:02 Neon spam= placing excessive neon over a build to gain attention from 6 year olds
general 2021-03-26 05:41:14 That makes sense...
general 2021-03-26 05:41:21 At one point, you use afk grinders
general 2021-03-26 05:41:43 Mhm
general 2021-03-26 05:41:49 ^^
general 2021-03-26 05:42:21 I’m at a point where I no longer need to grind, so I can see how that’s tedious
general 2021-03-26 05:42:28 Def
general 2021-03-26 05:42:40 That’s one part of BABFT I dislike :<
general 2021-03-26 05:43:02 Mk, so grinding, block placement, physics
general 2021-03-26 05:43:36 I can see how that makes our game unappealing to some groups
general 2021-03-26 05:43:55 We do have LOTS of blocks
general 2021-03-26 05:44:04 Many of them are useless tho...
general 2021-03-26 05:44:27 The skill gap in build a boat is massive^^...
general 2021-03-26 05:44:44 I’ve been playing for 3 years, and only got Top Builder last year...
general 2021-03-26 05:45:00 It’s quite the endeavor ^^...
general 2021-03-26 05:45:04 ;-;
general 2021-03-26 05:45:24 I spot a fellow warship builder :3
general 2021-03-26 05:45:34 
general 2021-03-26 05:45:57 Oh no
general 2021-03-26 05:45:59 I will refute
general 2021-03-26 05:46:30 
general 2021-03-26 05:46:51 I want water 😭
general 2021-03-26 05:46:56 We have sand for water
general 2021-03-26 05:47:28 But yes, we make proper boats :3
general 2021-03-26 05:49:09 I would love if BABFT had any physics
general 2021-03-26 05:49:14 Our planes just fly straight
general 2021-03-26 05:49:25 However, we can emulate physics
general 2021-03-26 05:49:41 
general 2021-03-26 05:49:45 Flex my friends build :3
general 2021-03-26 05:49:52 Servos
general 2021-03-26 05:50:00 Yes?
general 2021-03-26 05:50:33 Retaliation:<
general 2021-03-26 05:51:00 Built it on iPad :3
general 2021-03-26 05:51:12 I can’t play anything on key and mouse for my life...
general 2021-03-26 05:51:17 Mhm
general 2021-03-26 05:51:34 Realistic water physics ;-;-
general 2021-03-26 05:51:37 I need
general 2021-03-26 05:52:12 ***ive been playing a game where sand is water for 3 years, any water is more realistic***
general 2021-03-26 05:52:24 Mmm
general 2021-03-26 05:52:31 We like everything about it
general 2021-03-26 05:52:33 Except
general 2021-03-26 05:52:39 Build mechanics
general 2021-03-26 05:53:00 You just can’t build these ships in Plane Crazy
general 2021-03-26 05:53:20 I already saw^^
general 2021-03-26 05:53:32 But it doesn’t give players complete control
general 2021-03-26 05:53:42 Not that it’s worse
general 2021-03-26 05:53:51 Lol
general 2021-03-26 05:54:01 Simpler blocks=less skill gap
general 2021-03-26 05:54:08 Let me pull a random build from BABFT
general 2021-03-26 05:55:12 First build I come across
general 2021-03-26 05:55:27 Most of our community are noobs, while it seems everyone here knows what they’re doing
general 2021-03-26 05:56:54 Lol
general 2021-03-26 05:57:14 Most of our community are noobs^^...
general 2021-03-26 05:58:11 I’ll go off for now^^ this chat was extremely useful
general 2021-03-26 05:58:24 I now have ideas on how to improve the game...
general 2021-03-26 05:58:26 Physics
general 2021-03-26 05:58:33 Block placement?
general 2021-03-26 05:58:35 Hmm
general 2021-03-26 05:58:43 ^^ cya!
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 04:40:46 Pro ship, which the BABFT community could build like this
general 2021-04-01 14:56:51 *BAPFT*
general 2021-04-01 14:58:32 
general 2021-04-01 14:58:55 *Boat Crazy*
general 2021-05-14 04:23:32 Not sure if Plan Crazy is plane crazy, but this is the guy thats ruining Build a Boat by making his build copy exploits
the-dump 2021-07-26 04:02:39 Build a Boat is a better game for building

*but after that, you leave these ships to rot since theres no pvp system* <:crazylaughzeg:764919988468973599>
general 2021-07-26 04:07:54 I love how this community’s skill level is all near the same
general 2021-07-26 04:08:10 If not, at least no noobs
bot-central 2021-07-26 04:08:30 ^^… I could give you the source if you wanted…
general 2021-07-26 04:08:58 Should I post a non PC build in <#384025409945337856> ? ^^
general 2021-07-26 04:09:23 Mein bote
general 2021-07-26 04:09:58 *build anything but a boat for your sanity*
general 2021-07-26 04:10:16 IJN Tone
general 2021-07-26 04:10:34 She had an airsuite on her aft, and all turrets to the bow
general 2021-07-26 04:11:24 Building a new boat ^^
general 2021-07-26 04:13:11 Just wish chill would add some plane crazy styled weapons
general 2021-07-26 04:13:39 *this is a joke*
general 2021-07-26 04:14:28 Shredder bugs don’t exist in BABFT
general 2021-07-26 04:14:33 Only suicide attack planes
general 2021-07-26 04:14:54 Yes, we can control anything with a chair and jet
general 2021-07-26 04:15:01 Because physics
general 2021-07-26 04:15:28 Anything
general 2021-07-26 04:15:37 Jets have no weight limit
general 2021-07-26 04:16:01 *beat the game using jets*
general 2021-07-26 04:16:29 Hihi Cobra
general 2021-07-26 04:16:49 Well we do get superior build mechanics *but thats it*
general 2021-07-26 04:16:59 I can’t pvp with them after they’re done ;-;—
general 2021-07-26 04:17:37 Hardly
general 2021-07-26 04:17:46 But much better than BABFT
general 2021-07-26 04:18:41 Babfts owner doesn’t want to add more pvp weapons, we are stuck with primitive handheld weapons and dynamite
general 2021-07-26 04:18:59 Astrocraft?
general 2021-07-26 04:19:26 I haven’t heard of Astrocraft before.. *hmmm*
general 2021-07-26 04:19:29 Actually
general 2021-07-26 04:20:02 I’ve been playing for 3 years :3
general 2021-07-26 04:20:11 I’m long past paywall
general 2021-07-26 04:20:14 Lol
general 2021-07-26 04:21:37 :3 the power of Top Builder yes
general 2021-07-26 04:22:20 Counter
general 2021-07-26 04:23:10 Astrocraft seems a little primitive hmm
general 2021-07-26 04:23:27 Can’t judge, havent played it yet ^^
general 2021-07-26 04:24:43 Counter
general 2021-07-26 04:25:30 Not tank, but counter :3
general 2021-07-26 04:26:00 BABFTs skill ceiling is too high, theres a huge disparity between the noobs and the top builders
general 2021-07-26 04:26:18 But wait, theres more!
general 2021-07-26 04:26:39 No editing:3
general 2021-07-26 04:26:48 Which part are you suspicious of?
general 2021-07-26 04:27:00 I can get in a game and take a different angle
general 2021-07-26 04:27:07 I built it
general 2021-07-26 04:27:11 F3X
general 2021-07-26 04:27:30 Its literally just 5 colors, in a wavy pattern
general 2021-07-26 04:27:44 The waves are easy ;-;
general 2021-07-26 04:27:56 The sky and waves took just a day ;-; *y no one talking about the ship*
general 2021-07-26 04:29:22 Still cant beat the first counter 🤦🏻‍♀️
general 2021-07-26 04:30:18 Nope
general 2021-07-26 04:30:23 I built that in game
general 2021-07-26 04:30:44 Angu
general 2021-07-26 04:30:55 <:angryPupper:640266372894687233>

general 2021-07-26 04:31:54 BMP2 moment
general 2021-07-26 04:32:10 
general 2021-07-26 04:32:10 Counter
general 2021-07-26 04:32:25 APC ^^
general 2021-07-26 04:32:37 BMP2 isnt a tank either
general 2021-07-26 04:32:52 ^^
general 2021-07-26 04:33:11 Mhm^^
general 2021-07-26 04:33:20 That scares me.
general 2021-07-26 04:33:36 Counter
general 2021-07-26 04:33:53 We make our own suspension
general 2021-07-26 04:34:11 *yeah, our paywall is ridiculous lol*
general 2021-07-26 04:34:31 I think the game is Astrocraft? Thats what we are battling lol
general 2021-07-26 04:35:01 To counter Astrocraft builds <:PoiGood:639894337920172033>
general 2021-07-26 04:36:33 I see you’re playing the funny snail game
general 2021-07-26 04:36:50 <:PoiGood:639894337920172033>
general 2021-07-26 04:36:58 4k is cheap
general 2021-07-26 04:37:03 Think 50k
general 2021-07-26 04:37:29 Japanese plane repair costs are so expensive…
general 2021-07-26 04:37:45 Yes?^^
general 2021-07-26 04:38:05 Idk what that is…
general 2021-07-26 04:38:22 Not a furry

general 2021-07-26 04:48:49 Why are you attempting a build battle? If you initiated a mechanics battle, I’d be dead all over now lol
general 2021-07-26 04:51:44 Phat question
general 2021-07-26 04:51:54 Are plane crazy youtubers popular?
general 2021-07-26 04:52:14 ?
general 2021-07-26 04:52:30 *I am simply researching* my pfp?

general 2021-07-26 05:04:24 *do plane crazy players and BABFT players intermingle??*
general 2021-07-26 05:04:43 *sighs*
general 2021-07-26 05:04:56 How did you know who I was then?
general 2021-07-26 05:05:19 Why did that sound grammatically incorrect
general 2021-07-26 05:05:34 Ohhhhh
general 2021-07-26 05:05:41 *remember~~*
general 2021-07-26 05:05:43 Nope…
general 2021-07-26 05:05:52 BABFT needs a new map for pvp
general 2021-07-26 05:06:07 :<<
general 2021-07-26 05:06:24 BABFT better building mechanics, everything else maybe plane crazy better
general 2021-07-26 05:06:34 And bigger plot space :3
general 2021-07-26 05:07:31 Poof perms
general 2021-07-26 05:08:56 *ummm..^^….*
general 2021-07-26 05:09:13 *your game owner actually cares about being pinged?..^^*
general 2021-07-26 05:09:48 ***our game owner could be dead for years and we wouldn’t know***
general 2021-07-26 05:11:33 I wanted to say it’s a hurricane chaser
general 2021-07-26 05:12:45 Your game owner actually bans ppl???
general 2021-07-26 05:12:51 *BABFT never bans*
general 2021-07-26 05:13:03 **our owner too lazy**
general 2021-07-26 05:16:55 Love how someone can build in PC, and it doesn’t look bad usually
general 2021-07-26 05:18:12 Average BABFT builds are awful
general 2021-07-26 05:18:37 Doesn’t exist :3
general 2021-07-26 05:19:25 How to become a shipwright?
general 2021-07-26 05:20:24 Is legal :<
general 2021-07-26 05:20:38 I ought to change it soon. Time to get rid of this bet
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:21:39 A “hurricane hunter” aircraft?
general 2021-07-26 05:24:02 M
general 2021-07-26 05:25:26 When everyone in this game is actually somewhat decent
general 2021-07-26 05:25:30 *sighs*
general 2021-07-26 05:25:43 *this is another reason why Plane crazy better*
general 2021-10-13 04:08:01 Posting BABFT pictures
general 2021-10-13 04:08:15 I’m preparing to get yelled at
general 2021-10-13 04:09:07 ^^ there are quite a bit of exposed servos…
general 2021-10-13 04:09:29 4 for crash barricades, and some springs for arrestor wires
general 2021-10-13 04:09:35 :<<<
general 2021-10-13 04:09:54 Plane crazy larger build plot when? 👀
general 2021-10-13 04:10:11 It looks hard tho ;-;
general 2021-10-13 04:10:24 Brb, going to take an angled pic
general 2021-10-13 04:10:49 ;-;, thats still… hard to do folding
general 2021-10-13 04:12:51 
general 2021-10-13 04:12:52 Still, longer plots would definitely make lives easier lol
general 2021-10-13 04:13:04 Iphone image queality
general 2021-10-13 04:13:07 Amazing
general 2021-10-13 04:13:54 Its a 2x2x2 stud cube
general 2021-10-13 04:14:15 But scaleable to .05
general 2021-10-13 04:14:22 So we can make tiny things ^^
general 2021-10-13 04:14:41 Mhm
general 2021-10-13 04:15:12 Our discord server got compromised a day ago, so I’m just floating around with nothing to do…
general 2021-10-13 04:15:19 All channels wiped
general 2021-10-13 04:15:37 BABFT hall of fame, gone 😔
general 2021-10-13 04:15:43 ?
general 2021-10-13 04:15:51 Youve heard?
general 2021-10-13 04:16:07 One of our admins had their account compromised
general 2021-10-13 04:16:14 They invited the fake bot
general 2021-10-13 04:16:29 This is the 2nd time in 2 months
general 2021-10-13 04:16:36 *all during my trial mod period*
general 2021-10-13 04:16:55 I’m a walking cloud of luck arent I? ^^
general 2021-10-13 04:17:12 The admin in question hasnt told us how yet
general 2021-10-13 04:17:27 But he isn’t a dumb person…
general 2021-10-13 04:17:44 Italian 👀
general 2021-10-13 04:17:47 Doubt
general 2021-10-13 04:17:54 Not sure
general 2021-10-13 04:18:01 It was done by a roblox group
general 2021-10-13 04:18:08 Hog riders or something
general 2021-10-13 04:18:15 Not a RAT, doubt a virus either
general 2021-10-13 04:18:25 2.6k ppl banned
general 2021-10-13 04:18:36 *we were thinking about manually unbanning them*
general 2021-10-13 04:18:49 **we even made a spreadsheet for most of them already**
general 2021-10-13 04:19:04 Dyno premium was the fake bot
general 2021-10-13 04:19:18 Yes, but I’m pretty sure it was nicknamed something else
general 2021-10-13 04:19:23 Dyno mk something
general 2021-10-13 04:19:50 Tell your staff to turn on 2FA for the time being, its being mandated for our staff rn
general 2021-10-13 04:19:56 No, it was a fake bot
general 2021-10-13 04:20:13 They compromised an admins account, and added a fake bot they made themselves
general 2021-10-13 04:20:36 The bot kept making admin roles and giving it to the perpetrators, making it really hard for us to remove them
general 2021-10-13 04:21:44 **all of our admins were asleep, so we practically begged for our Co owner to stop them** there was also a bunch of nsfw thrown around during the raid…
general 2021-10-13 04:22:01 It was a security failure.
general 2021-10-13 04:22:13 *2 admins compromised in 2 months*
general 2021-10-13 04:22:21 Back to back
general 2021-10-13 04:22:30 Pretty sure
general 2021-10-13 04:22:39 Hopefully everyone was smart enough not to click
general 2021-10-13 04:23:03 The situation rn is stable, but as a result, everything is gone
general 2021-10-13 04:23:14 Every single channel was deleted
general 2021-10-13 04:23:22 🐛
general 2021-10-13 04:27:37 Not sure what is was… we will have to wait…
general 2021-10-13 04:28:36 Hmmm
general 2021-10-13 04:28:38 French
general 2021-10-13 04:28:41 Mirage?
general 2021-10-13 04:28:59 Not delta a
general 2021-10-13 04:29:17 Shoot
general 2021-10-13 04:29:20 Brain
general 2021-10-13 04:29:50 Which?
general 2021-10-13 04:30:38 That explains the wing
general 2021-10-13 04:30:49 The fuselage was the dead giveaway that it was a mirage
general 2021-10-13 04:31:00 But the wing threw me off ^^
general 2021-10-13 04:31:11 **now**
general 2021-10-13 04:31:53 A lot
general 2021-10-13 04:32:00 Remove treasure
general 2021-10-13 04:32:07 No one builds for treasure^^
general 2021-10-13 04:32:23 I run a Build server and lets see…
general 2021-10-13 04:32:41 6 divisions rn, each with 30-35 aircraft
general 2021-10-13 04:32:57 180 aircraft in only my server…
general 2021-10-13 04:33:06 We need updated pvp mechanics
general 2021-10-13 04:33:20 Motorlock wouldnt be useless
general 2021-10-13 04:33:24 It would be godsend
general 2021-10-13 04:33:35 We can make them now
general 2021-10-13 04:33:50 Unfortunately, theyre really slow, so theyre worthless
general 2021-10-13 04:34:02 Guess the plane
general 2021-10-13 04:34:06 Yes I’m being unfair
general 2021-10-13 04:34:21 Fighting with a wwii pl-
general 2021-10-13 04:34:29 What did he
general 2021-10-13 04:34:42 Orbital cannon?
general 2021-10-13 04:34:55 Explain
general 2021-10-13 04:35:03 Its a torpedo bomber^^
general 2021-10-13 04:35:19 Oh, so like a carousel reloader?
general 2021-10-13 04:35:31 Mhm
general 2021-10-13 04:35:33 Definitely
general 2021-10-13 04:35:44 But dynamite is too big, its annoying
general 2021-10-13 04:35:52 Mhm
general 2021-10-13 04:36:12 nO
general 2021-10-13 04:36:18 Its very low powered
general 2021-10-13 04:36:34 Compared to Plane crazy’s guns I bet
general 2021-10-13 04:36:42 *motorlock doesnt exist in babft*
general 2021-10-13 04:36:45 Pain
general 2021-10-13 04:37:04 Multiple magnets doesn’t increase output unfortunately
general 2021-10-13 04:37:16 Or significantly enough
general 2021-10-13 04:37:25 It just makes whatever its attached to go haywire
general 2021-10-13 04:37:49 So guess the plane! You can use googl-
general 2021-10-13 04:37:53 That is not a bf109
general 2021-10-13 04:38:01 No way.
general 2021-10-13 04:38:12 Because pain
general 2021-10-13 04:38:19 No way.
general 2021-10-13 04:38:38 Since when did bfs have radial engines…
general 2021-10-13 04:39:06 *german engineer ig*
general 2021-10-13 04:39:18 Chill ways 💰
general 2021-10-13 04:39:46 Now. Guess the plane
general 2021-10-13 04:39:56 V something
general 2021-10-13 04:40:02 16?
general 2021-10-13 04:40:10 No
general 2021-10-13 04:40:17 And no :<
general 2021-10-13 04:40:33 ALSO AAA
general 2021-10-13 04:40:42 Hint
general 2021-10-13 04:40:56 Its name means Comet
general 2021-10-13 04:41:11 Looks british
general 2021-10-13 04:41:27 It has an inverted gull wing
general 2021-10-13 04:41:35 Looks british
general 2021-10-13 04:42:03 Drats
general 2021-10-13 04:42:05 :<
general 2021-10-13 04:42:13 No
general 2021-10-13 04:42:59 A navy fighter with a canard??

general 2021-10-13 04:47:40 H u h
general 2021-10-13 04:48:02 Now that you mention it, doesnt look like a kingfisher
general 2021-10-13 04:48:31 Oof I gtg cya!
general 2021-10-29 03:54:57 Question
general 2021-10-29 03:55:27 I’m coming from Build a Boat to ask a question, uhmm does Plane Crazy have their fair share of exploiter issues?
general 2021-10-29 03:55:41 Uhh
general 2021-10-29 03:56:58 I’m coming from Build a Boat to ask a question, uhmm does Plane Crazy have their fair share of exploiter issues?
general 2021-10-29 03:57:18 *sighs*
general 2021-10-29 03:57:32 Is it a big issue here as well?
general 2021-10-29 03:57:47 They can’t copy a whole build?
general 2021-10-29 03:58:00 WAIT
general 2021-10-29 03:58:09 So you guys developed an anticheat?
general 2021-10-29 03:58:35 Elaborate
general 2021-10-29 03:58:49 BABFT has been having exploiter threats all over
general 2021-10-29 03:59:31 Well is it true exploiters can’t copy builds in regular Plane Crazy?
general 2021-10-29 03:59:54 *because thats a huge we are having*
general 2021-10-29 04:00:07 Builds thats taken months stolen in seconds
general 2021-10-29 04:00:48 *we need that anti cheat*
general 2021-10-29 04:02:10 Oh I’m coming from the Build a Boat community, we have an exploiting crisis from over there and I was wondering how other building games coped^^…
general 2021-10-29 04:03:36 In BABFT, our exploiters can unfortunately steal any build they want
general 2021-10-29 04:04:02 And its a huge issue that we haven’t been able to fix yet
general 2021-10-29 04:04:32 Chill hasn’t taken any notable action
general 2021-10-29 04:05:13 Let us know how you did it afterward :3
general 2021-10-29 04:05:23 Thats technology we are begging for
general 2021-10-29 04:06:20 Mirage looking nice^^
general 2021-10-29 04:06:49 Maybe add transparency tool in the paint tool?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:08:59 Random E13A ~~totally PC~~
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:09:32 ~~its build a boat for treasure :3~~
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:09:49 Imo, babft needs better pvp mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:04 🔫
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:19 We have F3X tools :3
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:28 Just terrible pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:41 
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:59 We need one
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:10:59 
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:11:22 *i dont thing we have one aaa*
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:11:46 Random su47
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:11:52 I want missile :<
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:17 Terrible ones
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:26 It can
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:29 We have turbines
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:43 Rolling mechanics are a bit iffy
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:58 I’m just a visitor^^
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:06 *anything*
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:34 Very little, we don’t have an upvote feature
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:41 Agreed
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:47 Babft physics are roblox
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:14:12 But as a building game, we excel ***we just need weapons now***
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:14:47 I want water physics ;-;-
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:15:15 But we have better build mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:15:25 Balances out
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:15:49 We can build better, but in the end, our builds have thousands of parts, so its super laggy
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:16:48 What if BABFT building style x plane crazy physics?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:11 PC2 gets f3x?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:31 Yt community sucks
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:37 The not people
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:45 Its just the grind to the top
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:08 Have you heard of themadvulpen?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:25 I’m essentially his counterpart in the BABFT community
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:36 BABFT doesnt like military vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:52 *its so hard to gain a foothold in the YT stage*
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:19:54 Same here, I have project builds too
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:24 Nothings edited :3
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:31 Its an ingame screenshot ^^
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:44 Actually yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:58 Terrible control

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:22:41 No, we make everything lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:23:03 Your worse nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:23:39 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:23:52 Let me find an img
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:24:43 
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:25:17 You can def tell its f3x lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:25:20 Its not that well made
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:25:37 *I slapped on the pumpkins
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:25:57 Yay!
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:26:02 We do have an anime artists too
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:26:11 They using BABFT as a drawing app lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:26:26 Dont have them on me rn
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:26:39 No nafw
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:26:48 Legal
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:27:05 We even have our war factions :3
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:27:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:27:52 I am not kidding
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:28:00 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:28:25 Theres a huge paywall ik
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:28:40 
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:28:55 You can make ANYTHING in babft
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:03 But tou cant use them
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:07 Gtg cya!
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:18 Its a tutorial build lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:28 Suppose to be a simple tiger p
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:30:13 *our fanbase only berates chill since he hasnt updated in months*
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:30:27 Can I send links here? Or is it not in my perms
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:30:32 I can show babft warfare
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:32:02 Ahabavs
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:32:03 Kk
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:32:07 Ill go then lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:52:16 Difficult to achieve flight physics in BABFT
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:52:33 Since we use F3X, theres no way for the system to know whats the wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:52:42 It is
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:53:01 You can also make somewhat realistic flight performance in babft as well
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:53:30 Qweasd controls
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:01 Cannons, slow moving cannon balls that move slower than jets
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:09 Dynamite, they explode on contact
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:14 We have no guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:31 *I’m pushing for it*
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:41 Not the unlimited blocks, but guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:49 Variable caliber guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:54:58 You can change fire rate and damage per shot
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:07 Will it be added?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:12 Highly likely not
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:24 Chill wants to keep BABFT a pacifist game
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:33 Cannons have long reloads
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:37 And they move slowly
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:55:55 Not great for aerial pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:56:13 It was added to the game as a way to clear rocks from the stages when you went down the river
general 2021-10-30 01:20:17 When was PC2 suppose to be released?
general 2021-10-30 01:20:43 Fair
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:46:41 I wonder what motor lock is for
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:47:49 This requires sea camo

F2 with no sea camo is no F2
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:49:49 Morgan?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:51:34 My friend made a nosferatu in build a boat, but this looks interesting
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 04:03:19 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 04:05:02 Slap a magnet engine, and it flies too fast to see

plane-crazy 2021-12-26 04:31:37 I remember somewhat
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 04:31:45 We were discussing babft vs plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 04:32:09 If I remember right, we dishes out contemporary builds at each other lol
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:38:23 Me sipping cocoa while I watch these blatant lies

***satisfaction***
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:41:17 Send me critical analyses of Build a Boat for Treasure, and I’ll send,

Also the straws were for mixing, not that much of a masochist^^…
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:47:29 Was asking the first question to someone else who wanted the cocoa lol

Was at a restaurant, so just used a straw for convenience

As for BABFT, I’m (ig an hr) an would like opinions from a similar game
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:52:36 I’m an hr, ig since we don’t use that term really, I’m a mod for babft, and for the hot cocoa *I elaborate* I used a straw because it was closest to the styrofoam cups,
creations-chat 2021-12-26 05:09:57 I see^^… and what are your thoughts about babft as a game? Just me personally asking people from other similar games to see what we could improve on 

Ik a lot about the paywall already as a main complaint lol

general 2022-01-01 03:45:03 No, PC can definitely have lore
general 2022-01-01 03:45:17 I want to say BABFT is a sandbox game mid to late game
general 2022-01-01 03:45:51 We only have 3 official devs

general 2022-01-01 03:47:01 His transparency with the community and even his unofficial devs is like a brick wall

general 2022-01-01 03:47:52 I want to say soft code
general 2022-01-01 03:48:02 Its just placing blocks

the-dump 2022-01-01 03:52:53 Tos

the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:10 If theres an argument
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:19 It has to be done cleanly
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:25 Meaning no cursing

the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:09 But it could prosper if we had a dedicate creations feedback channel
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:16 Or a babft topic channel
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:25 Like I said, our actives no longer play babft

the-dump 2022-01-01 04:11:54 95% of ppl who play babft are 9 year olds
the-dump 2022-01-01 04:12:19 If you can get that into your skull, you’ll understand why our pro to noob population gap is massive
creations-chat 2022-01-01 04:16:18 I’m confused as well

general 2022-01-25 04:33:31 We managed to contain damage fast enough
general 2022-01-25 04:34:23 2nd time it happened, another admin was compromised, admin roles were given to raiders, and they deleted all channels, most roles, banned all active mods, and spammed nsfw
general 2022-01-25 04:34:51 Babft late game is just building
general 2022-01-25 04:35:01 The only fun is finishing the product
general 2022-01-25 04:35:22 Build a Boat for Treasure
general 2022-01-25 04:35:37 Not entirely
general 2022-01-25 04:35:49 That’s actually really up there
general 2022-01-25 04:35:54 Wrong
general 2022-01-25 04:35:59 Its build anything but a boat
general 2022-01-25 04:36:18 I’m struggling to keep warship builders alive
general 2022-01-25 04:37:17 But yes, us babft mods are forced to have 2FA on
general 2022-01-25 04:37:40 🗿

general 2022-01-25 04:42:02 #1 no cursing for us
general 2022-01-25 04:42:10 #2 toxicity bad
general 2022-01-25 04:42:16 Id dish out verbals
general 2022-01-25 04:42:28 I always say, critique good
general 2022-01-25 04:42:36 Trashing bad
general 2022-01-25 04:42:47 Constructive criticism is important
general 2022-01-25 04:43:11 The average skill of our community is *down* **there**
general 2022-01-25 04:43:28 Dyno automods
general 2022-01-25 04:44:12 The anti tank sentiment is real
general 2022-01-25 04:44:23 Cursing usually correlates with toxicity
general 2022-01-25 04:44:34 And it makes some people uncomfortable
general 2022-01-25 04:44:58 *me without image perms*
general 2022-01-25 04:45:04 Unbased
general 2022-01-25 04:45:16 👍
general 2022-01-25 04:45:58 I rarely play PC, but I do like progression
general 2022-01-25 04:46:07 Babft is stagnantion
general 2022-01-25 04:46:26 🗿
general 2022-01-25 04:46:44 Our dev only updates when theres a holiday
general 2022-01-25 04:47:11 But its just *unpolished*
general 2022-01-25 04:47:22 Some guy got 10k swords
general 2022-01-25 04:47:26 Reskinned swords
general 2022-01-25 04:47:51 Note block cool
general 2022-01-25 04:48:00 But the new cannon is infuriating
general 2022-01-25 04:48:34 Which is why glitches rule in babft
general 2022-01-25 04:48:40 You cant play without them
general 2022-01-25 04:48:44 It’s unplayable
general 2022-01-25 04:48:57 I’m at the point where I no longer need to grind
general 2022-01-25 04:49:14 I get rewards winning competitions now :3
general 2022-01-25 04:49:38 Volatile
general 2022-01-25 04:50:00 Yes it propelled technology decades into the future
general 2022-01-25 04:50:42 Babft has bad after build implementation
general 2022-01-25 04:50:50 Post build implementation
general 2022-01-25 04:52:05 Mm, thats disputed
general 2022-01-25 04:52:24 I have a decent tank, but ships I can for sure say one person
general 2022-01-25 04:52:31 Lets do it

the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:40 Plane crazy has its own charm
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:49 We can just use studio f3x
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:03:37 Pc s post build implementation is amazing
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:03:52 In babft, we can’t do anything with out builds after its done
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:11 Its like spend 3 months building, finish, dont touch again
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:18 Our pvp mechanics are abhorrent
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:51 Our jet turbines can outrun our only cannons

general 2022-01-30 01:04:57 amazing
general 2022-04-08 22:16:38 Me when the when
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:23:54 I don’t get motorlocking babft player btw
Its like saying blocky<microblock different ppl, different styles
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:30:11 Will PC2 add rotations? Similar to F3X
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:31:54 For gods sake, stop you two, next topic
Will PC2 have more F3X features? Or is nothing really released yet


<@!793132196810588200> I’m asking a question?…
general 2022-04-08 22:34:20 Dumpster fire
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:36:33 Will PC2 keep on relying on motorlocks? Or will rotations be added 

I’m bailing out, this is stupid
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:38:20 Will PC2 rely on motorlocks or will be incremental rotations be added
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:39:15 I see, so similar constraints will be placed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:39:34 ✋ not a PC player, just a babft player whos interested
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:40:02 I see
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:40:22 Ooo
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:40:34 Maybe we will start seeing more competition in the sandbox genre
general 2022-04-08 22:41:31 In this culture, do we ping mods if theres an argument?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:41:36 BABFT
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:41:52 Build a Boat
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:42:04 We use F3X, a completely different system
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:42:31 Hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:42:33 Basically studios
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:42:49 Theres no physics though
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:43:04 So planes aren’t given too much thought
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:43:16 Far more than rafts now :/
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:43:40 Unfortunately, mostly 9 year olds with cars
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:43:58 But since its F3X, I don’t understand motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:11 But F3X :3
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:16 Basically studios smh
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:25 You can build anything
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:38 ^
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:50 Thats not possible in PC
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:44:58 But physics don’t exist
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:45:32 We have 0.05 scale
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:45:41 So tiny details maybe us
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:46:19 I’m primarily a shipbuilder, so it’s interesting to see how you guys fit them in the plot
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:46:38 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:46:50 Old ship
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:46:57 Cant move though
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:47:00 Theres no ocean
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:47:14 Theres a river
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:47:17 Of sand
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:47:56 Limits on what you can do in PC makes cool builds
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:48:07 But we basically go for photorealism
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:48:39 Bigger
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:48:44 Our discord has 200k
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:49:07 Most of them don’t play the game anymore
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:49:22 You need to grind for them tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:49:57 I’m at the point where I no longer need to grind
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:50:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:50:16 Boat motors for rudimentary steering
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:50:31 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:50:46 I made an aircraft too, no photo now tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:50:55 Arguable
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:51:25 If you want a game you can play on an ipad for the best building experience
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:51:27 Its it
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:51:39 Content creators appeal to children
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:51:49 no we do
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:52:31 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:52:59 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:53:01 Same guy
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:53:40 One plot for us is 200x100 studs
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:53:59 So 50x100 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:54:01 Ish
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:55:44 That plane is marginally larger than our average jets
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:57:30 PC PVP is so much better than ours
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:00 You ca outrun canon balls lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:12 Plane pvp is infuriating
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:16 Ship pvp is no room
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:30 Tank pvp is slow cannon shells
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:42 Our jets fly faster than cannonballs
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:52 Brb
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 22:58:56 Agreed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:01:15 Our community doesn’t trash talk others builds, but as a result, the average builder makes tumor rafts
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:02:06 I was in the crossfire of the argument today
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:02:19 Someone told me to shut up for trying to break up a fight :/
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:02:34 Mod in babft discord btw ^
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:02:45 It was over something dumb too lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:03:07 Like really dumb
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:03:31 This chat seems a lot more civilized
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:03:43 Oh god
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:04:09 I see
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:05:28 Burk-
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:06:52 Babft is non existent
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:07:01 Planes fly straight
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:07:42 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:07:52 HoF staff too, we run it differently
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:07:59 Staff picks what gets in
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:08:07 Mods are usually former players
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:08:09 Usually
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:08:26 Almost all of hof staff are current or former players
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:08:45 We have professionals roles for people who win boat of the weeks
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:08:59 It would be nice to have mods who relate to the community
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:09:28 👍
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:09:41 If theres an argument in babft, we put it down
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:09:45 Unless its a debate
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:05 1. Cursing is not allowed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:12 Gets rid of most of the toxicity
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:20 2. Large active mod team
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:26 No cursing
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:30 Nothings allowed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:40 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:10:54 Keeps away most of the toxicity
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:11:11 Of course the occasional argument happens
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:11:22 But 9/10 theres a mod lurking ready to kill fights
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:11:52 We just don’t allow cursing 👍
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:12:04 And our members usually all get a greenname if they play the game
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:12:17 So member to member, the disparity isn’t much
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:12:29 But we have roles for ppl who are top builders
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:12:35 Seasonal champions etc
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:12:42 No we do, but only for the top of the top
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:13:15 With 30k concurrent players, only 300 or so are known to be (elites)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:13:30 Summer, that rises to 50k
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:13:40 The elites have class systems
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:13:47 Quite a bit
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:14:28 Most of our actives in general dont play the game
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:14:33 But the elites have a separate chat
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:15:23 We also have a lack of respect for military builders
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:15:38 We *used* to have factions
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:15:50 Not much in babft
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:15:51 No
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:16:05 Most servers dm added good players and died in 6 months
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:16:14 Mine is at 500, staying strong for years
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:16:29 9yr olds with cars dominate
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:17:56 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:02 We have one who passed 1m subs
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:05 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:08 I’m one myself
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:12 8k tho :/
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:17 I’m babfts vulpen
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:23 Babft military videos
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:44 Our community demonizes tanks tho :/
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:18:55 Our tank builders push out so many tanks they think its overrated
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:19:08 Even though theyre just having fun
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:19:28 Tanks in general
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:19:43 gtg for now
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:19:47 Eh its ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:22:57 As a tutorial creator, not many ppl watch tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:23:02 They prefer glitch tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:23:21 With a large playerbase, and maybe 4k ppl who watch tutorials, its not stigmatized
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:23:34 But rather, severely underused
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:23:54 Agreed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 23:24:03 Not the best team anymore for magnet grinding

general 2022-07-03 18:59:47 remove them
general 2022-07-03 19:00:17 the culture here is weird

general 2022-07-03 19:05:02 just ideas for staff
general 2022-07-03 19:05:40 the issue is bully due to ranks?
general 2022-07-03 19:06:08 remove ranks, I see no reason to have them
general 2022-07-03 19:06:11 there are so many
general 2022-07-03 19:06:20 simplify them
general 2022-07-03 19:06:22 theres so many
general 2022-07-03 19:06:26 condense them
general 2022-07-03 19:06:36 theres no reason to have 50
the-dump 2022-07-03 19:06:48 y e s
general 2022-07-03 19:07:20 prior knowledge: no one cares about channels like that
general 2022-07-03 19:07:35 we have a simple rank system
general 2022-07-03 19:07:51 regular members, Master builders, double trouble, extreme builders, and top builders
general 2022-07-03 19:08:10 regular members comprise of nearly every member
general 2022-07-03 19:08:37 then remove the flames

general 2022-07-03 19:09:12 ive been here for a long
general 2022-07-03 19:09:13 long time
general 2022-07-03 19:10:00 but our build mechanics are better?
general 2022-07-03 19:10:07 your physics mechanics are superior
general 2022-07-03 19:10:25 don't worry ive done this multiple times in this server
general 2022-07-03 19:10:31 babft pvp is abhorrent
general 2022-07-03 19:10:34 I hate it
general 2022-07-03 19:10:43 your physics are better
general 2022-07-03 19:11:00 but our F3X gives more flexibility
general 2022-07-03 19:11:30 not like we cant do that too
general 2022-07-03 19:12:08 its fine lol
general 2022-07-03 19:12:29 if you look through my server history here
general 2022-07-03 19:12:37 i've done this once or twice by now lol
general 2022-07-03 19:13:03 oh god
general 2022-07-03 19:13:24 well its true how your rank system is an issue
general 2022-07-03 19:14:32 by keeping toxic members, you push out the other members and the cycle continues breeding toxicity, thats why if we see toxic people, we are typically given the go ahead to just ban them directly
general 2022-07-03 19:14:36 no warns needed
general 2022-07-03 19:15:05 just something to sleep on ^^
general 2022-07-03 19:15:22 uhh yes
general 2022-07-03 19:15:38 rbx I think he helped me verify my acc
general 2022-07-03 19:16:52 if you have any questions about how we mod, ask away
general 2022-07-03 19:17:14 but looking at the state of the server rn, people would consider it as a rein of terror
general 2022-07-03 19:17:44 thats not really how a server should work ^^...
general 2022-07-03 19:18:09 except build, yes

general 2022-07-04 05:38:26 Hes having a mental breakdown?
general 2022-07-04 05:38:43 Funny
general 2022-07-04 05:39:31 Told him mod team should ban toxicity
general 2022-07-04 05:39:39 May have enlightened him bit much
general 2022-07-04 05:40:39 Modteam should be running the server, not the members lol
general 2022-07-04 05:41:27 I get that, its just that this server is “irreparably toxic”
general 2022-07-04 05:41:51 🗿
general 2022-07-04 05:41:59 I figured that out fast a while ago
general 2022-07-04 05:42:28 I also suggested role compression
general 2022-07-04 05:42:41 Rn is a lot less toxic than 10 hrs ago
general 2022-07-04 05:42:52 Calm
general 2022-07-04 05:44:36 Fake news

general 2022-07-04 05:45:25 Can’t be surprised
general 2022-07-04 05:45:44 😔
general 2022-07-04 05:45:51 We have superior building mechanics
general 2022-07-04 05:46:01 Physics pvp etc
general 2022-07-04 05:46:03 You guys win
general 2022-07-04 05:46:10 We don’t need motorlock
general 2022-07-04 05:46:17 Our plot is already big
general 2022-07-04 05:46:42 We can put blocks inside eachnother to begin with
general 2022-07-04 05:46:55 I can beat any build you dish out :3

general 2022-07-04 05:47:39 Our pvp system is abhorrent
general 2022-07-04 05:47:45 Paywall exists
general 2022-07-04 05:47:48 Not a fan
general 2022-07-04 05:48:07 But our build mechanics superior ^^
general 2022-07-04 05:48:13 Yes
general 2022-07-04 05:48:16 We make our own
general 2022-07-04 05:48:33 Spam much?

general 2022-07-04 05:48:59 We can make it
general 2022-07-04 05:49:18 I can show “realistic” water
general 2022-07-04 05:49:58 Astrocraft is so backshelf though, I barely hear anything of it
general 2022-07-04 05:50:45 Well it is for what yoy want
general 2022-07-04 05:51:00 If you want to build, babft is the better game, pvp? Plane crazy
general 2022-07-04 05:51:50 I havent gone down the river in years
general 2022-07-04 05:51:54 I just build

general 2022-07-04 05:52:34 Build competitions
general 2022-07-04 05:53:16 Babft is in our devs eyes an adventure game, I see it as a build game
general 2022-07-04 05:53:33 Never said it wasn’t
general 2022-07-04 05:54:06 ^^ I can also call the mods down on you

general 2022-07-04 06:31:47 Would give it to CS

general 2023-05-17 02:39:20 And he only talks to us “helpers” when it’s about 💰 or new assets
general 2023-05-17 02:39:49 We assume he’s in college
