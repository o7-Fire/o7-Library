plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:55:35 how make big build fold no works
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:57:44 it did folds but the one i sent is 1/3rd of the full build and when i try fold its doesnt fit
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:59:02 thats more than half of plot height
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:59:36 im tryma make it big
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:59:43 but when bigger plot
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:00:39 why infinite map instead of infinite plot
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:01:22 no like there would be a map right
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:01:32 and the plots would be in a separate area of the game server
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:01:34 like far away
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:01:46 not technically infinite but large(r) plots
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:02:05 i said large(r)
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:02:09 not infinite
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:02:57 so what are they adding in plane crazy 2
