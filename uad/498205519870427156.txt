creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:14:21 I made a drone which can fire rockets, airstrike other players, and shoot. It can go up to 200 mph and is very good off land.
general 2020-04-09 05:48:43 I have went over the tutorial twice on how this game works and i still dont understand why this airplane will not fly. I got all of the controls good, and the blue and yellow lines match up perfectly. When I fly it does not let me go down and it keeps right and doing loops in the sky. Please tell me how i can fix this
general 2020-04-09 05:49:00 I have been trying to fix it for almost an hour
general 2020-04-09 05:50:13 do u want me to make a hotel elevator, or a skyscraper elevator?
general 2020-04-09 05:50:43 it is mouse controlled
general 2020-04-09 05:50:53 ok

general 2020-04-09 05:52:05 i dont wanna download that shit
general 2020-04-09 05:52:40 maybe your videos should be put in the right format when recorded?
general 2020-04-09 05:52:50 it aint that hard, i use xbox game bar
general 2020-04-09 05:53:10 and when i am done it sends the recording straight to videos file
general 2020-04-09 05:53:31 download xbox game bar, it does not affect your frame rate and gives a clean, high def video
general 2020-04-09 05:53:44 and it does not require other people to download it to view
general 2020-04-09 05:54:02 ?

general 2020-04-10 22:32:18 blocks turn invisible when you go in firs person
general 2020-04-10 22:32:21 so that might be why
general 2020-04-10 22:35:13 are u in first person? because when you go into first person, the block you have selected goes invisible.
general 2020-04-10 22:35:57 it is a problem with roblox, and the devs will not be able to fix it unless they make the transparency of the block you have selected 1, and if they do that players will get confused on which block is placed and which is selected
general 2020-04-10 22:36:21 oh
general 2020-04-10 22:36:27 try rejoining
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:21:32 looks good, just the wings need to be bigger
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:21:41 the base is good, just the wings need to be more spread out and big.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:13 epic
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:51 cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:56 e p i c
general 2020-04-10 23:23:18 could someone tell me how to do motor lock and how it works?
general 2020-04-10 23:23:42 honestly it does not
general 2020-04-10 23:23:51 i do not under stand what it does or how to use it
general 2020-04-10 23:24:14 what do people even use it for?
general 2020-04-10 23:24:37 cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:34 ok so i made the Gulfstream G650 and i would like some criticism on it. Is it good, bad, decent, tell me what you think of it and how i could improve it. The only difference from the real Gulfstream G650 is that theres 4 jets instead of 2.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:55 also i did not make the split down the front windows

plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:28:29 any way i can improve it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:28:49 i wanna give it a paint job, just idk what to do to paint it
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:31:24 how
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:12:22 so i built a vehicle that makes its wheels go into the car and come out. I am planning on turning it into a hover  car. How do i stop the wheels from extending below the car when i make the wheels go out of the car?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:12:37 the water mark is from a website that reduces the file size, ignore it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:13:23 what does motor 2 even do?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:13:50 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:14:10 how do i edit the angle of motor2?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:14:33 nvm

creations-chat 2020-04-11 20:56:40 Decided to goof around with trails and ended up making this really cool rainbow.
creations-chat 2020-04-12 01:52:01 I made an airstrike drone. It can go really fast, hovers off of ground, and has a turret in the front for fighting. It has 248 blocks in total.
creations-chat 2020-04-12 01:52:14 This is how much blocks it has
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:01:56 o
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:01:58 ok
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:14:42 could u not spam ur creation? we only need to see one angle of it; plus, it makes it so people cant see other creations above it
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:54:42 cool
general 2020-04-12 08:58:18 Lol
help 2020-04-14 03:35:46 when i activate the propellers using motors, they keep spinning to the right. how do i sto pthat from happening?
help 2020-04-14 03:36:20 uh
help 2020-04-14 03:36:31 they just spin the opposite direction
help 2020-04-14 03:36:36 ohhh
help 2020-04-14 03:36:40 ok, i will try that
help 2020-04-14 03:38:58 just did that, when i activate it, it does not go up or down
help 2020-04-14 03:39:04 it is basically as if i never turned em on
help 2020-04-14 03:39:27 right, will try
help 2020-04-14 03:39:43 well if i invert the blade, the same thing happens
help 2020-04-14 03:39:58 because when i make the blades normally go the opposite direction it goes down
help 2020-04-14 03:40:05 when they go the normal direction they go up
help 2020-04-14 03:40:18 so if there are 2 equal forces of down and up, it will basically be as if it is off
help 2020-04-14 03:40:59 this is why i hate when people dislike my drone just because it has hover pads
help 2020-04-14 03:41:14 where if i were to do blades, it would just be this wierd spinning thing
help 2020-04-14 03:41:59 k
help 2020-04-14 03:42:02 i will do that
help 2020-04-14 03:44:50 ah yes the same thing happens, it does nothing
help 2020-04-14 03:45:29 i just wanted to make an airdrop drone that drops explosives on stuff
help 2020-04-14 03:45:34 and i literally cant
help 2020-04-14 03:46:04 and if i put hover pads, the community hates it because they 'want to see more builds without hover pads'
help 2020-04-14 03:46:14 what does max torque even do
help 2020-04-14 03:46:26 and which blades should i do it too
help 2020-04-14 03:46:29 'to
help 2020-04-14 03:46:41 well all speed is set to 30
help 2020-04-14 03:47:00 so what should i set it to for the circled blades
help 2020-04-14 03:47:10 alright
help 2020-04-14 03:47:17 i will change the others to 25
help 2020-04-14 03:47:20 to make it half
help 2020-04-14 03:47:50 no
help 2020-04-14 03:48:11 the top motor is for going up / down with it, and the bottom motor is for hovering above planes and stuff
help 2020-04-14 03:48:20 rn i am only using the top motor
help 2020-04-14 03:48:24 and it literally does nothing=
help 2020-04-14 03:48:28 same result
help 2020-04-14 03:49:14 nope
help 2020-04-14 03:50:34 it is literally impossible to make a drone without hover pads. If i use thrusters for it, then when i am hovering and move forward, it will make the drone lean forward, so when i try to go up, it will literally dive right into the ground
help 2020-04-14 03:50:53 sur e
help 2020-04-14 03:50:54 sure
help 2020-04-14 03:50:59 i would like to i guess
general 2020-04-14 03:51:35 anyone know how to make a drone without the community hating you for using hover pads?
general 2020-04-14 03:51:54 using prop blades makes it either spin left or right when going up
general 2020-04-14 03:52:34 i tried making half of the 4 prop blades go opposite direction, but it just ends up not going up or down at all
general 2020-04-14 03:53:04 and if i use thrusters, then going forward would make the drone lean, making it so when i go up it would  dive into the ground
general 2020-04-14 03:54:19 i just wanted to make an airdrop drone that drops explosives on stuff
general 2020-04-14 03:54:53 honestly i am tired of people hating on my drone i made just because i used a new block. when the only way to even make a drone is with hover pads
general 2020-04-14 03:55:03 ?
general 2020-04-14 03:55:08 idk what u are even talking about
general 2020-04-14 03:55:09 but ok
general 2020-04-14 03:55:27 yeah, as if a flying box is going to get me a design rank lol
general 2020-04-14 03:56:31 what are u all even talking about

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:31:11 i am making a regular drone with blades in each corner
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:31:25 all of the tutorials either have hover pads in em or are outdated
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:33:11 ???
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:05 
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:10 it is from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:39 i was going to use the controls for my main build

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:35:28 ik how to make the blades and controls, just idk how to stop it from turning
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:42:10 this is the drone I am trying to make. It uses motors below and prop blades. When I activate it to go up, it keeps turning to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:42:21 idk how to fix it
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:43:50 true
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:02 which two

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:37 right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:45:33 well, the left side of my drone has motors facing front. The other side has motors facing the back. It still keeps spinning
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:47:03 the mass is completely centered
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:47:17 idk what or why it wont stop spinning to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:49:17 ?????
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:50:46 how is that gonna help me in any way on how to make it??
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:14:21 i give up, i am just going to say that it is impossible to make a drone
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:14:26 i have been trying for the past 2 hours
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:14:43 the best response I have gotten so far is 'bruh'
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:17:16 all it has done is turn right every time i activate it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:19:43 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:21:32 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:22:38 
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:26:16 o well then, guess I cam claim it is literally impossible to make a drone without hover pads
help 2020-04-15 00:31:18 For the past 2 hours, I have been trying to fix my drone. Every time I made it go up, it spins to the right while going up. Not a single person so far has been able to solve this issue.
help 2020-04-15 00:35:03 o wow, thanks for the feedback!
