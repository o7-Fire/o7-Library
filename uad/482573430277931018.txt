plane-crazy 2022-12-12 07:18:59 does anybody know what happened to helis? because when you hover in one place for a long time the heli just goes unstable and wiggles weirdly and you cant even control it, the only way to fix it is to fly upwards but if you stay it again does that
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 07:19:04 it happens to all of my helis
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 07:20:07 not being in the right spot?

creations-chat 2023-05-01 10:52:44 Woah man, I appreciate your message, I will try improving it by how it is described in your message, thank you.
creations-chat 2023-05-01 10:54:52 I was originally using 3d model of MH-53, but the 3d model had name "CH-53" not MH, so I thought that CH is the name of that model. Sorry for that
creations-chat 2023-05-01 10:57:33 Alright, thank you.
creations-chat 2023-05-01 11:03:43 So I basically just made a 2-in-1
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 12:17:27 Is it allowed to use small propellors engines only for pitch, yaw and roll but not using them for flight?
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 12:45:33 Good nose for mig-29?
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 12:50:13 
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 12:51:19 ?
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 13:28:08 Should I do cylinder cockpit for mig-29?
creations-chat 2023-05-01 13:51:28 Good nose for mig-29?
creations-chat 2023-05-01 16:35:32 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/935989994735169546/1087710515150733322/8E48E6B0-62BA-47E2-B3C4-9A64901D3E86.gif
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:41:21 I thought there's a second intake for a second
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:19:06 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:25:27 I played plane crazy for a long time now but I still build shit vehicles lmao
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:27:52 Which one?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:28:02 I'll just show mig-29 I'm working on
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:28:14 Since its my only jet without exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:28:57 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:29:27 I can show my f-22 made for pvp but not for looks
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:00 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:04 Exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:28 Dude
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:40 Do you know why I call my F-15 the god of exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:20 But again, this build wasn't meant to look good
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:25 It was meant to kill people
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:30 In which it does a good job
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:32:49 It wouldnt be bad if it didnt had that much exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:44:55 Is the top view of front of the mig-29 looking fine?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:45:21 How do I improve it then?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:48:11 I tried making cylinder cockpit, turns out I'm not good enough for these
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:48:23 They're too hard
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:48:26 For me
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:50:13 What's nam jet?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:52:04 You want me to add half blocks to the sides?

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:07:19 Well technically there is motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:08:51 ?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:09:19 I hope you can see the changes
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:11:36 I tried
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:11:43 .
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:08 Its just hard
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:09 For me
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:17 It looked horrible
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:23 I'm not ready for cylinder cockpits
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:13:12 I have 30 days

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:21 I tried making cylinder cockpits 2 times
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:25 I failed
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:01 I need to ask the other guy who made mig-29 how he made his cylinder cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:26 This guy somehow managed to

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 15:59:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 15:59:35 If I fucked up, then tell me how to improve these wings
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 15:59:45 Instead of just saying "You fucked up you are bad"
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:00:38 They are flat in the 3d model I use
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:00:42 So not my fault
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:01:34 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:10:53 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:13:35 This better now?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:16:59 I changed them already
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 16:17:05 Cough cough
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 17:28:40 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 17:33:20 Rate mig-29
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:09:57 Hey, how many blocks is that build?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:10:23 Mine is 2k, how many hover engines did you use
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:10:26 And do you also lag?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:10:32 Because when I fly my mig-29 I get 20 fps
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:10:36 From 60 to 20
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:10:42 Fps
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:11:10 I have RTX 3070 and my FPS drops from 60 to 20 because of flying my jet
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:11:52 Unspawned, maybe the amount of motorlock is the issue
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:12:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:12:15 I also recently clean it
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:12:42 What do I replace then
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:13:11 Link to the drivers?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 18:13:24 I'm not in a private server

general 2023-05-03 10:56:19 Just wait a second and I'll join
general 2023-05-03 10:59:44 SU-27 is pretty easy to learn
general 2023-05-03 10:59:49 Cause the cockpit is not clickable
general 2023-05-03 11:00:02 Wait until you get something like f-18 or f-16, then you will realize the full pain of dcs
general 2023-05-03 11:00:22 To fully learn f-16 it took me about
general 2023-05-03 11:00:24 1.5 months
general 2023-05-03 11:00:39 Mig-29 took me 2 days
general 2023-05-03 11:00:50 See the difference between clickable jets and non clickable now?
general 2023-05-03 11:01:34 Why is your radio connected to an airport

plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:19:56 Can anyone tell me why whenever I roll my aircraft it just pulls into opposite direction until it flies straight again
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:20:02 This really makes roll hard
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:22:34 The thing is
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:22:35 I don't
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:23:05 I tried that too
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:24:32 It is very stable at straight flight, I think the issue is because of the big weight and small wing area
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:24:47 I made mig-21 too heavy lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 10:25:07 No shit

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:54:52 
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:55:58 My first normal looking jet without abnormal amount of exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:56:15 Exactly thats why I say that its not finished

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:56:59 So they will normaly fit into these 3x3 engines

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:58:44 I have worse builds
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:58:58 I might try making the nose shorter
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:59:38 Lol what is that
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:00:57 My mig-29 needs alot of tweaks for it to actually look normal
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:01:39 And I'm over here asking y'all guys opinion on it so I can change it
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:02:22 Maybe I need to make the spine end a bit earlier
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:02:51 Also that thing drops my fps form 60 to 20 when spawned lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:04:33 Cockpit is a bit small
