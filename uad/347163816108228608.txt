plane-crazy 2018-11-25 01:03:23 It's a start, basically the bow
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:14:50 It would be nice to not have the wheels bounce all the time
creations-chat 2019-02-19 22:16:23 Man, it was easier for my panzerzug to move, now it barely

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:20:53 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:21:06 no room
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:21:47 it's been done since the major update

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:23:07 
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:23:48 It should be light enough to not be bouncing all the time
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:24:09 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:25:03 I don't want to rebuild my PZ.Zug
bug-reports 2019-02-19 22:26:10 The powered wheels are wobbling as well
bug-reports 2019-02-19 22:26:49 I can't even work on some railcars with that pain
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 22:27:55 I'm leaving and gave up on this!
creations-chat 2019-02-20 04:50:38 No need to turn around
creations-chat 2019-02-20 04:55:15 It can drive with out derailing
creations-chat 2019-02-20 05:05:17 the main pilot seat is at the other side of the railcar
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:06:39 other side of the same railcar
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:09:48 When I tested it on the turns, It started up nicely.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:12:54 Does it require to get to both stations?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:24:02 I did my own bogies for the railcar which is in 2 pieces

creations-chat 2019-02-21 00:13:23 Deja Vu
creations-chat 2019-02-21 00:23:23 so much lag tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:34:07 It's hard to put up the number for a Locomotive
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:35:24 Especially doing a rough model of London & North Western Railway's 790 Hardwicke.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:50:44 The Track layout is only for Freelance like Street Cars.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:51:07 Railway
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:52:10 If for actual Locomotives, Perimeter be a better choice. Due to length
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:53:11 Freelance is a Railroad for Locomotives & Rolling Stock to navigate turns meant for Streetcars & Trams.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 20:59:42 A track for a Maglev would be fun.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 21:06:59 It's Hard to tool around in My HI-Rail Truck.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 21:08:14 Anyone else did a Hi-Rail Truck?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 21:14:02 Should I do better with that truck?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 21:25:52 Still a WIP
creations-chat 2021-02-14 21:28:30 Subs ain't easy comparing to the railway side I do

creations-chat 2021-02-14 21:33:50 What's should do About the Sub & truck...
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:09:01 My Flyin' Ship (Which is about ready for a revamp.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:09:19 Which You Can't Flip
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:10:54 Which I still have since the Early Version of the game
creations-chat 2021-02-14 23:12:59 Want to see something retro?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 23:15:11 I have that ship since the early days of the game
creations-chat 2021-02-14 23:20:49 I am giving it a revamp
creations-chat 2021-02-14 23:24:12 Like I said, I have it since the early days of the game before all these extras
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:27:04 I don't remember what year, All I remember, that it was before the paint feature
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:30:05 Since then, I still have that Flyin Pirate Ship.
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 23:56:35 I see. I am giving it a revamp now.
creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:16:17 After a Good Revamp. Though I had her guns as a display piece
creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:19:29 The Guns and the upper portions of the lanterns are Steel.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:21:28 After Revamp
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 06:46:33 Redid the Wheels
creations-chat 2021-02-16 07:23:31 Finally Changed the Wheels.
creations-chat 2021-02-16 07:57:17 no idea.
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 00:01:06 It would be nice to have the Rail lines be redone with Regauge to make a better chance of better scaling done.
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 00:02:38 It's hard to Model the Japanese Kiha 40 with the tracks like that. The Gradient is unrealistic. (No ABT system)
