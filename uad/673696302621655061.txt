bug-reports 2021-01-23 22:34:14 hey i found a bug where my neighbor plot teleports me everytime they spawn their build, not a big deal since ive never encountered it before and i can just rejoin.
general 2021-03-07 17:31:42 why dont motor 2 have an autocorrect setting or something so that when they get pushed they rotate themselves back to the set angle when you have servo enabled
general 2021-03-07 17:36:01 but servo doesnt fix itself when your build is heavy, even if it just has a large volume and helium to make it lighter it doesnt do anything. all it does is rotate the motor in the angle you want and then you hope it stays like that
general 2021-03-07 17:36:37 doesnt fix it
general 2021-03-07 17:37:22 ive tried. the thing i need it to work for is my mech cuz it just gets pulled into a sitting position by the motor 2 fsr
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 01:40:33 thats the first actually decent thing someone has said on this server

creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:21:19 yeah I don’t really see the problem lol
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:24:24 <@883063424614006878> wings should fold back so that there is a perfect 180 line from the intake to the tip of the wing but other than that it looks pretty good
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:29:05 
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:32:18 bro hyperbot is on break rn chill
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:36:39 i would use custom guns instead on wings and move guns inside the airframe

creations-chat 2022-07-28 04:26:09 i swear i saw someone get warned for saying it earlier
creations-chat 2022-07-28 04:33:32 the cockpit should very wide and stretch all the way to the front of the heli, the turret should be under the pilot seat

creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:16:36 i had to delete cuz i just remembered los pollos hermanos language is not allowed here
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:22:38 looks very good but the front wings shouldn’t be that bent back.
the colors look very good especially the afterburner
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:26:33 virigjn saul goodman vs chad lalo salamanca
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:29:50 did they end up hiring someone for the map? the game is good but i hope they change the map cuz it is kind of trash, train tracks should go all around the map and the ocean shohld also go all around the map and have rivers
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:34:47 They should improve missile ai and add countermeasures with a 30 second cooldown
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:37:06 just select the green color code and trial and error it until you find one you like


<@664538133114912783> what bugs?

creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:41:57 maybe i wont next time
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:09:34 i am assuming that means not the entirety of the map will be rendered at once? i don’t know if i like that
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:13:35 why is this hof
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:15:45 its very good but idk about hof
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:18:48 idk in comparison to these
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:21:11 lol I don’t need to be able to make something as good as it in order to judge it. when you compare it to the other builds, it is not as good. idk how you think rating things works lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:23:49 idk ive seen it before in other games

<@413827183790915607> that’s fair
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:27:55 lockheed martin produce el avion pero ellos no los fueron los disenadores
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:29:58 Actually my iPhone was made by Liang Xiaodan (he is 13) (he works in the factory)
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:33:14 Nah the military usually has Lockheed Martin produce the stuff and other people design it
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:36:08 You can go as fast as you want, also speed is studs per sec
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:38:10 u right lol

creations-chat 2022-07-28 07:21:09 dang you got me
creations-chat 2022-09-23 17:18:13 you might be able to motorlock the horizontal stab motor into the airframe near engine
creations-chat 2022-09-23 17:36:42 eh
