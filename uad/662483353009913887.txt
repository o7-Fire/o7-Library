general 2020-12-07 00:02:54 Hey is there any way I can add a suggestion for the game
general 2020-12-07 00:03:01 rip
general 2020-12-07 00:03:13 They should add whitelisting
general 2020-12-07 00:03:19 a
general 2020-12-07 00:04:03 They should seriously add a feature for you to build with other people •~•
general 2020-12-07 00:04:30 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-12-07 00:10:52 Please tell me I'm not the only one that thinks the game needs a feature to let other people build with you
general 2020-12-07 00:11:04 Like on the same plot

general 2020-12-07 00:13:12 a
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 00:14:09 **SUGGESTION:** A feature, similar to blacklisting, that allows other players access to build on your plot with you. Basically whitelisting.

plane-crazy 2020-12-07 00:24:37 Teehee
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:15:59 What if we had the ability for other people to be gunners
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:16:16 So they can jump on your plane and actually **shoot**
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:14:54 That is one smooth sub
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:16:12 ~~it would be really cool if we had some sort of copilot or gunner seat that allowed someone to actually do something like man a turret or drop a bomb load~~
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:16:54 Ik
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:02 **i know**
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:15 I dont mean whitelisting though
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:17 I mean like
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:20 ANYONE
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:25 Can go in the seat
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:32 So they dont really need perms
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:17:45 No it wouldnt
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:18:00 You could just blacklist everyone you dont want to get in
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:18:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:18:30 Modern problems require modern solutions
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:04 I wish they just had a system like
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:18 It instantly has everyone blacklisted when you join
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:21 BUT
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:31 It would be because they could build on your lot
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:37 Isk
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:19:42 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:20:04 I think whitelisting would be an awesome feature, it just won't. Ever. Happen

general 2020-12-14 20:53:08 The British Supermarine Spitfire was the only Allied fighter aircraft of the Second World War to fight in front line service from the beginnings of the conflict, in September 1939, through to the end in August 1945. Post-war, the Spitfire's service career continued into the 1950s.[1] The basic airframe proved to be extremely adaptable, capable of taking far more powerful engines and far greater loads than its original role as a short-range interceptor had called for. This would lead to 19 marks of Spitfire and 52 sub-variants being produced throughout the Second World War, and beyond.[2] The many changes were made in order to fulfil Royal Air Force requirements and to successfully engage in combat with ever-improving enemy aircraft.[3

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 23:55:19 Technically removing the symbol is a really stupid idea when you think about it. Its part of history, and it relates to a time when yes, people suffered, and yes, it was one of the darkest times in human history. But without the insignia on planes/cars and such, it wouldn't be recognized as a sign that was used for evil over 70 years ago. I'm not saying anyone needs to agree with me, nobody has to, but I personally think that as long as it isn't being glorified or used as some kind of joke, and its in an image relating to that time of history for historical purposes only, it should be allowed.
