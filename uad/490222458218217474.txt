creations-chat 2020-01-02 16:39:43 howitzer formation (springs allow recoil after firing and sparklers give shell discarding effect)
creations-chat 2020-01-02 16:41:18 i dont want rank just want to see if my building skills are good or bad
creations-chat 2020-01-02 16:43:24 oh bc the fireworks are the shells

creations-chat 2020-01-04 16:34:21 new day, new howtizer
my attempt for a C3 105mm Howtizer
springs for recoil
sparkler for sparks effect
counterweight at the back
extra shells
creations-chat 2020-01-04 16:47:14 C3 105mm Howitzers are commonly used for avalanche control but some of them were used in Afghanistan i think
creations-chat 2020-01-04 16:49:21 so desert camo seems fitting
creations-chat 2020-01-04 16:56:20 well the canadian military still uses it for avalanche control from various sources
