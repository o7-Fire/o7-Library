general 2023-06-05 20:51:11 I just want to post some stuff I made

plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:33:40 what is the best plane recommendation for pvp servers?
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:33:58 I use a brick
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:34:08 there has to be something better

plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:34:51 if I wanted to make a laser how do I do it?
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:43:05 I made a mechanism that shot spheres but it didn't look like a laser
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:43:11 they were explosive balls
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:43:46 do you think I could use ropes for the laser effect?
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 02:44:47 I would have used smoke pipes on a spring but they're toggle only
