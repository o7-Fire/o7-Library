creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:24:37 Creation is empty bruh
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:26:13 <@407347404858458123> no ones posting since the funny sausage
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:27:45 <@661550706511314944> I know I just don't like being alone, especially in a discord server
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:29:32 Thanks for the advice mate
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:30:37 Me too, no actually
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:31:54 I'm not addicted to the game, I'm addicted to perfection in my builds. I hop on every few hours trying to make my builds perfect but it always fails
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:32:46 A completionist can only dream of such achivements
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:34:43 Don't you see, my body is fueled by laziness and I will get tired quickly if I use actual skills on my builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:37:00 Please give me context
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:39:49 Ah thanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:42:26 <@467765396108476426> ah yes comrade, we need more swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:43:39 This is what happens if you don't put slow mode lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:44:38 Markiplier?! Mark zuckerberg?! E! E! E!
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:45:20 We need doomguy to end his misery
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:46:39 Does foward swept wings help? I heard they improve maneuverability
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:48:10 <@295784513152221184> looks dumb?! Look at the ADFX-02 Morgan!
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:49:58 This turned from creation feedback to general really quick
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:53:17 <@295784513152221184> I have many example of good looking foward swept planes the ADF-01 falken and the X-02S Strike wyvern
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:54:55 Oof damn
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:56:26 Saying wips without capital letters looks really weird
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:57:58 <@661550706511314944> thats mostly true
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:59:33 <#497142796961054721> is even worse but is more crowded by more people
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:05:28 <@486947728320888842> real good. What is it anyway?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:07:14 <@486947728320888842> wait lemme think, the ship that both served the republic and the imperial?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:08:58 Ah I finally remember now, used to watch them battle against the hammerhead corvette in space engineers
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:10:29 <@486947728320888842> I tried to build a vtol A-Wing but it failed miserably
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:12:18 <@486947728320888842> wait the star destroyer mounted with a big death cannon that can destroy planets?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:14:33 Never really watched the sequels and I only watch videos reasoning why its bad, the sequel kinda ruined anakin legacy being the chosen one because he erased both sith and Jedi but now palpatine has come back
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:16:49 Rey saying "I am all the Jedi" was really cringy
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:18:26 At least they should've put windu, obi wan, Yoda, anakin and other Jedi voice over Rey because it would've sound more epic
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:20:45 And oh yeah, put a scene where palpatine slapped rey while yelling "you are not the chosen one"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:22:16 K imma roll out to other channels
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:28:18 Those damn kids in my backyards, hang on imma grab my 9mm real quick
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:30:09 Got rid of them, no one would find them in my backyard
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:31:41 There's a large bush near my backyard, should be a perfect hiding spot for their dead bodies
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:33:12 <@555965248184778753> they peed once they saw me with the 9mm so hell no
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:35:35 I should call a SWAT team against my neighbors under an anonymous identity so they would get suspicious with my neighbor after finding the dead bodies
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:37:49 "To get freedom, you must revolt against the people with the most freedom"
"WE SHOULD GO AGAINST CHILDREN WITH LEUKEMIA"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:39:35 Law doesn't matter if you already committed several felony's
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:41:38 Hmm but the president is sharing power with the vice president and thats communism
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:43:08 Atoms shares electrons with other atoms and thats communism
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:44:45 This went from <#504436696021204992> to <#497142796961054721> but darker and more memer
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:47:42 Okay I'm not proud to start this chain reaction that would be the change of <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:49:38 Normal physics and quantum physics doesn't share the same properties and rules, thats not communism
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:51:09 I'm blue daba dee daba da

the-dump 2020-11-16 11:03:11 <@582834773773254656> THAT TUTORIAL EXIST?!

the-dump 2020-11-16 11:06:21 I'm still frustrated that theres no triangle wedge x2

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:32:38 Use helium as secondary lift. It helped my jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:33:27 Make sure to use the apply to center function
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:35:24 Lets refund the flat earth space agency
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:37:13 Kill that dog
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:37:19 Punch it to death
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 11:37:49 Bruh never had sibling is the first place

the-dump 2020-11-16 11:42:54 <@634770928865116164> i like your funny words magic man
the-dump 2020-11-16 11:50:49 Thanks but im in mobile
the-dump 2020-11-16 11:51:44 Why is there a turbofan engine and a pork on "the hangar" channel?
the-dump 2020-11-16 11:53:43 Can you check on em to see what they are doing?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 12:02:30 Has anyone made some salvation- i mean the alicorn/super scinfaxi class submarine?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 12:04:02 We need some more salvation in this community
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:08:07 Ah ace attorney, a masterpiece in the meme community
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:09:15 Bruh moment L
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:11:56 It maybe an unpopular opinion but i hate the pog face, staring face and the weirchamp face
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:12:50 I hate everyone in general especially myself
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:13:18 Whats the difference
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:13:42 Both are basically Memes channel but the <#497142796961054721>  is more crowded
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:14:31 Bruh imagine how many people the mods and admins need to ban because people kept posting Memes on general
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:16:48 "Guys please keep the Memes out of general and post them to the dump, anyway this is the reason why i think half triangle wedge x2 should not be added" -the mods
I will probably get warned so if i dissapear then you know why
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:19:25 There's still no half triangle wedge x2 yet, I NEED THEM FOR MY BUILDS
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:20:05 Half triangle wedge x2 not half wedge
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:14 There's only one half triangle wedge and thats the normal one, can someone suggest the admins to add triangle wedge x2
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:33 Hmm
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:49 Hé be still be busy
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:24:26 Oh yeah we need sink wedge too, its basically like the cutter but reverse shape
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:25:04 Ye like that
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:25:39 Normal wedge will take up 2 block wide but a sink wedge will only take 1 blocks wide
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:26:13 Oh my god
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:26:53 Imma go afk
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:33:16 I have a suggestion, can someone make a floating megastructure that has close tracking Rockets and railguns, it also has tunnels that are specifically made for planes to go through and inside those tunnels are structural supports that you have to shoot at. Need my ace combat dream to become true
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:34:20 Yeah
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:35:13 <@719168864705052802> but what?
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:35:33 Same thats why i asked people to do it
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:36:43 Imma search for a willing guy to do it. I sound like a scumbag :_(
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:41:12 Can someone make a megastructure that has close tracking Rockets and railguns, it must also have a tunnel specifically for planes to go through and inside those tunnels are structural support that you have to destroy
Notice: i am lazy and i want people other than me to do it, i may sound like a scumbag and you're right
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:42:17 <@392334096560554001> what i described a superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:43:44 <@661550706511314944> a mega structure with tunnel that are meant for planes and inside are structural support that you have to destroy
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:44:23 No basically a floating megalith, search it up
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:45:26 Dont say it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:45:56 No floating as in the ocean
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:47:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:47:36 It took you this long to get it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:48:54 Can you imagine how cool is it flying through a base tunnel that is floating in the ocean while destroying it from the inside
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:50:11 And oh yeah you need to go out fast because y know you destroyed all the structural support
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:51:38 It would be cool seeing your friend fly out of the mega structure while its crumbling
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:53:20 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:55:11 Maybe my dream of going through a tunnel and destroying everything from the inside is just a fantasy that will never come true
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:56:42 My ping goes 326
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 12:58:29 <@447221768520859659> thats nothing compared to my crappy wifi. The ping can go up to 326 to 473
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:00:21 Is dissing a political opponent a crime?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:02:01 My turning time increased from 7 seconds to 12 seconds in bad fps condition
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:03:08 <@392778761701031947> faster than the speed of light
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:04:23 Why is trim canards so hard to work with, i tried it with my Stealth plane but it caused too much pitch or too little pitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:05:35 Use helium blocks to fix the pitching problem, it helps alot but it causes lift problem <@289930922655088640>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:07:48 If the plane pitch too much then put helium in the back, if the plane pitch too little then put helium in the front. Helium blocks are the only reason why i can build jets, jets to an amateur is physically impossible to make but with the help of helium it will be possible
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:09:26 Helium works real well with jets, its not like it will care it up 3000 feet up in the air
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:12 But to be honest, helium also works as a roll balancer, it wont go right or left too much. Going right or left will be detrimental in a fight, it can basically make you turn off course losing your target
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:05 I added helium to my jet because it helps me take off easier, my jet was intended to be launched from short decked submarines but since the submarine project got cancelled, im left with an interceptor that is forced to go into dogfight against superiour enemies which is not its intended purpose
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:58 My project submarine deck was real short, the end of the sub is basically right infornt of the front gear
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:18:37 Oh yeah and my project sub runway was real short too so i need as much lift as i can while aborting a landing
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:20:15 <@447221768520859659> the center of mass is offset from the center of the main block, a slight offset could be detrimental to a vtol aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:23:16 My jet CoM and CoL is 7 blocks away from eachother so i really need helium to help me balance
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:23:39 Nosferatu?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:24:54 > why not mess around with the weight instead
<@526713899958140928> there's not much room in the fuselage to mess with the weight its full, filled with engines and control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:27:29 <@526713899958140928> the same with your argument. I dont use motorlock because they feel unrealistic
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:29:04 Why waste my time on a jet that im proud of because i know it will just get shot down by better planes, i cant improve because i know it wont be as good as the other jets
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:29:47 There's limits on improvement
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:32:09 <@447221768520859659> now that you mention that, i will not consider posting my carrier
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:34:30 Why do people need to flex. Like just keep your personal achivement personal, it wont change your life
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:36:02 > remember kids, whatever youre good at, theres always an asian kid better than you.
<@526713899958140928> me crying that my ancestor created better people than me
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:37:55 People in PVP pick functions over looks, cm on i want to see a jet against jet battle not some weapons on wheel spawnkilling everyone
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:40:20 My friend friend literally bashed my friend cause my friend mech wasnt accurate to realistic mech. My friend friend then kept using "noob bad, pros good" as an argument
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:42:15 Wait isnt arguing going to get you banned?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:43:15 "Advanced non arguing"

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:47:05 Can you imagine how hard it is trying to shoot down a jet going 500kph using a railgun
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:48:05 Shredders erratic movement helps the shredders

creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:33:37 Tips on how to get up votes:
1. Make your builds stand out
2. Use vibrant colors
3. Don't make it look dumb
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:35:28 <@683069192143896594> I mean vibrant gray, you know you need to focus things on the important part of the build and to make it stand out from the normal hull is by using darker, lighter grey
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:37:00 I hate it when custom builds gets overshadowed by more overrated builds
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:38:36 Like by following others footsteps to the pathway of popularity will make you look like a scumbag in the long run
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:40:26 People now only wants attention, not attention because of affection but because of popularity

creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:53:49 I prefer carrier with angled Decks because they have more space meaning I can take off and land easily without going left and right to avoid obstacles

creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:05:16 Okay my theory went up from plausible to possible. Ice skater mech does indeed exist somewhere
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:06:56 <@683069192143896594> have a piston that can extend a fabric block so that when the fabric block touch the ground, it would stop the skating
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:08:28 <@683069192143896594> the problem is that, I cant build mechs too. I like tunnels and jets, thats it
