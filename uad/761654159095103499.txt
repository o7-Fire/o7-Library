general 2022-04-18 04:30:37 
general 2022-04-18 04:33:35 oh man
general 2022-04-18 04:33:38 people were very mad
general 2022-04-18 04:34:07 <@370594904268734464> do you think i will get banned
general 2022-04-18 04:34:13 if i make a plane exporter
general 2022-04-18 04:34:52 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:35:35 i really want to create a game similar to plane crazy
general 2022-04-18 04:35:41 but all the planes you build can be ai controlled
general 2022-04-18 04:35:50 so you could have a big ass firefight
general 2022-04-18 04:35:54 with like a friend or something
general 2022-04-18 04:36:11 i thought i could optimize runtime simulation with unionization
general 2022-04-18 04:36:18 what's c.a.t.s
general 2022-04-18 04:36:29 more like
general 2022-04-18 04:36:34 more like
general 2022-04-18 04:36:41 its a pvp queuing system
general 2022-04-18 04:36:42 right
general 2022-04-18 04:36:54 how do i explain it in such a way
general 2022-04-18 04:36:55 hmm
general 2022-04-18 04:37:05 Yes
general 2022-04-18 04:37:09 but u need to buy
general 2022-04-18 04:37:14 the parts you used
general 2022-04-18 04:37:17 by winning against
general 2022-04-18 04:37:19 or pvp
general 2022-04-18 04:37:19 pve
general 2022-04-18 04:37:37 so like
general 2022-04-18 04:38:17 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:38:22 im thinking bigger than that
general 2022-04-18 04:38:30 it would be on a 3d plane
general 2022-04-18 04:38:36 there would be different maps
general 2022-04-18 04:38:53 and all vehicle elements can be ai controlled
general 2022-04-18 04:38:57 so like the turret and the flying
general 2022-04-18 04:39:16 i don't
general 2022-04-18 04:39:18 know how to explain
general 2022-04-18 04:39:22 OK
general 2022-04-18 04:39:32 it would be a large scale strategy game, WITH vehicle designing
general 2022-04-18 04:39:36 AND a economy and competitive system
general 2022-04-18 04:39:37 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:39:44 AND
general 2022-04-18 04:39:53 what the fuck
general 2022-04-18 04:39:55 is brick rig
general 2022-04-18 04:40:30 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:40:32 i'll give youa  example
general 2022-04-18 04:40:40 imagine a ww2 battle where you get to design your aircraft carrier
general 2022-04-18 04:40:44 and the aircraft on the carrier
general 2022-04-18 04:40:51 AND the ships
general 2022-04-18 04:40:55 accompanying the carrier
general 2022-04-18 04:41:10 Not just "a" fleet
general 2022-04-18 04:41:18 you would be able to design naval invasion support utilities
general 2022-04-18 04:41:27 and designate where your infantry would land
general 2022-04-18 04:41:33 literally could not explain
general 2022-04-18 04:42:18 no
general 2022-04-18 04:42:26 YOU WOULD BE RUNNING THE AMERICAN WAR ECONOMY
general 2022-04-18 04:42:31 AND RESEARCHING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
general 2022-04-18 04:42:38 WHILE DESIGNING VEHICLE TO FIGHT OTHER PLAYERS
general 2022-04-18 04:42:52 it would be way  to ambitious
general 2022-04-18 04:42:53 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:42:54 so
general 2022-04-18 04:42:58 you design your vehicles
general 2022-04-18 04:43:08 and you fight other people with their own vehicles
general 2022-04-18 04:43:14 just like plane crazy
general 2022-04-18 04:43:16 but more organized
general 2022-04-18 04:43:21 and there would be multiple
general 2022-04-18 04:43:23 of your same vehicle(s)
general 2022-04-18 04:43:34 you would be running a squad
general 2022-04-18 04:43:37 basically
general 2022-04-18 04:43:41 of your OWN design
general 2022-04-18 04:43:45 with your own helicopters
general 2022-04-18 04:43:49 with your own air support
general 2022-04-18 04:43:51 with your own tanks
general 2022-04-18 04:43:53 with your own jeeps
general 2022-04-18 04:44:12 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:44:22 uh the infantry men
general 2022-04-18 04:44:29 would be just equipped with a gun
general 2022-04-18 04:44:30 nothing else
general 2022-04-18 04:44:37 for example if their vehicle got shot up
general 2022-04-18 04:44:41 and it no longer worked
general 2022-04-18 04:44:46 they'd ditch their vehicle
general 2022-04-18 04:45:22 bureaucracy?
general 2022-04-18 04:45:32 MAYBE
general 2022-04-18 04:45:35 definitely maybe
general 2022-04-18 04:45:49 but i've been called crazy before
general 2022-04-18 04:46:08 ok
general 2022-04-18 04:46:10 i can simply it
general 2022-04-18 04:46:17 think warno, but you design your own vehicles
general 2022-04-18 04:46:29 oh fuck
general 2022-04-18 04:46:32 i just realized this game
general 2022-04-18 04:46:33 already exist
general 2022-04-18 04:46:39 im gonna
general 2022-04-18 04:46:41 have premade vehicles
general 2022-04-18 04:46:45 but its up to the user to edit / modify
general 2022-04-18 04:47:04 Yes
general 2022-04-18 04:47:12 REFUSE
general 2022-04-18 04:47:19 actually

general 2022-05-07 07:10:31 Hello everyone! How are you guys doing today?
general 2022-05-07 07:10:48 Fuck you too.
general 2022-05-07 07:11:03 I'm sorry to hear that. I hope the rest of your day gets better.
general 2022-05-07 07:11:12 Ez
general 2022-05-07 07:11:33 I'm excited to start building mechs too!
general 2022-05-07 07:11:46 There's no need to be rude!
general 2022-05-07 07:12:09 I completely agree! We are all making different choices and doing different things with our lives. It's what makes us unique and special.
general 2022-05-07 07:12:32 I fucking hate you too!
general 2022-05-07 07:13:02 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I'll try to be more careful in the future.
general 2022-05-07 07:13:26 Hi sweetie! How are you doing?
general 2022-05-07 07:13:37 ok god this ai fucking is gay
general 2022-05-07 07:13:52 I don't have any v bucks to give you, sorry!
general 2022-05-07 07:14:05 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disrespect you. I'll shut my trap now.
general 2022-05-07 07:14:15 I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. Could you please explain it to me?
general 2022-05-07 07:14:31 We'll see what you're made of.
general 2022-05-07 07:15:03 This is an interesting question. I'm not sure if there are seven plot builds, but I'll try to answer it.

1. The first plot build up is the exposition, which sets up the world and characters.
2. The second plot build up is the rising action, which starts to introduce the conflict.
3. The third plot build up is the climax, which is the height of the conflict.
4. The fourth plot build up is the falling action, which starts to resolve the conflict.
5. The fifth plot build up is the denouement, which is the resolution of the conflict.
6. The sixth plot build up is the aftermath, which shows the consequences of the conflict.
7. The seventh plot build up is the moral, which is the lesson learned from the story.
general 2022-05-07 07:15:16 You must be really good at Fortnite!
general 2022-05-07 07:15:28 I'm sorry you feel that way - I hope you'll take the time to read it anyway!
general 2022-05-07 07:15:42 It sounds like you think this person is being too clingy and you want to talk to their parents about it.
general 2022-05-07 07:15:53 That's amazing!
general 2022-05-07 07:16:16 Yes, I think they would be happy to hear that their son is acting gay on the internet.
