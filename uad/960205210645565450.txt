general 2022-06-13 17:15:24 ok
general 2022-06-13 17:15:29 thanks
general 2022-06-13 17:16:24 yo guys so i’m on ipad but is there an easier way for motor flaps to work without up and down buttons
bot-central 2022-06-13 17:17:27 !rank
bot-central 2022-06-13 17:18:03 well that’s depressing
general 2022-06-13 17:18:40 guys i need a cold-war-ish plane to build that’s simple enough to make without motorlock or motor flaps
general 2022-06-13 17:18:43 any suggestions
general 2022-06-13 17:19:06 no i started like a month ago it’s too over complicated
general 2022-06-13 17:19:22 and i have no use for it
general 2022-06-13 17:19:45 i can just use wedges and the blocks to make angles
general 2022-06-13 17:19:55 and i always have enough space for guns or engines
general 2022-06-13 17:20:02 since i use hover engines
general 2022-06-13 17:21:21 guys when should i use motor lock?
general 2022-06-13 17:21:29 like what is the use for motor lock
general 2022-06-13 17:22:20 i use motor lock towers for bombs but that’s the only time i rlly use it
general 2022-06-13 17:22:36 and i’ve tried to make angled with it but it doesn’t work
general 2022-06-13 17:22:37 angles*
bot-central 2022-06-13 17:22:48 !rank

general 2022-07-05 18:55:55 yo guys
general 2022-07-05 18:56:09 i built a b26 marauder and it looks pretty good
general 2022-07-05 18:56:30 but it has the inverted control surface glitch and i can only fix it if i delete the pilot seat and place it again after every single load
creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:02:09 guys i made a b26 marauder and it looks good but it has the control surface glitch and the controls are inverted. It only fixes whenever i delete the pilot seat and place it back after every single load and it’s so annoying.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:16:19 it says creations chat and it’s a creation

help 2022-07-05 19:18:36 i made a b26 marauder and it looks good but it has the inverted control surface glitch and it only works if i delete and replace the pilot seat after every single load and it’s so annoying so any ideas?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:18:50 ok
creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:21:18 forget the motors the flames bro
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:31:11 control surfaces invert controls and make everything stiffen on some builds. it’s only fixed by deleted and replacing the pilot seat every single time you load it in.
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:31:57 normal plot
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:32:18 no joystick since i’m ipad
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:32:30 it only does it on one of builds but i heard other people have it too
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:32:41 one of my builds*
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:32:46 wdym
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:07 glitched mouse as in normal pilot seat
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:14 not a main pilot seat?
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:22 no i tried both and it’s the same
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:36 ok
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:41 send me a friend request
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:33:59 i can’t send photos

bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:37:22 and what do u want me to do with that website
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:37:32 how
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:40:20 https://streamable.com/c15bfp
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:40:33 bomber isn’t even done and it’s already glitched
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:41:18 look at the joystick movement to see how it’s wrong
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:12 maybe it has something to do with the wheels?
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:20 since they’re car wheels
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:24 hm
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:53 well
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:57 if it helps
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:05 the problem started after i added the gear
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:24 k
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:32 brb
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:44:59 no difference 😭
bug-reports 2022-07-05 21:33:32 nice until you cant roll or yaw and the plane randomly dives or climbs at times
help 2022-07-05 21:36:22 Don’t let any blocks touch the motor or the gear. You can use half wedges or trails and connect them to a hover thruster or a half cylinder using a 1x2 text or sign.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 21:37:37 lol yeah that is
help 2022-07-05 21:37:57 np
help 2022-07-05 21:38:13 if you need more help you can send me a friend request and i’ll show you some of my gears
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:30:40 they’re not flipped because flipping control surfaces on mobile doesn’t do anything
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:30:57 and it’s not useful or realistic because you can’t turn at all
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:31:02 it turns on it’s own
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:42:15 so nobody has a fix for inverted controls?
bug-reports 2022-07-18 01:20:29 @everyone
bug-reports 2022-07-18 01:20:33 oops wrong one
