plane-crazy 2019-12-03 22:07:13 so we had this weird dog plane combo
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 22:08:45 
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 22:24:05 the game is so broken rn
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 22:24:13 i cant even spawn my sub without getting it flung
bug-reports 2019-12-03 23:35:39 apparently this other guy and i shared this plot and neither of us could spawn with out getting stuck
bug-reports 2019-12-03 23:36:57 and same as sirusdog, by sub gets yeeted upwards but then ends up under the map
bug-reports 2019-12-03 23:37:00 my*
bug-reports 2019-12-03 23:37:12 and thats with an anchor block activated
bug-reports 2019-12-07 15:41:48 my torpedoes stopped working cuz the propellors in them just slow down drastically
bug-reports 2019-12-07 15:42:00 and then they get rlly easy to dodge
bug-reports 2019-12-07 15:42:14 and the flinging with anchor blocks glitch
bug-reports 2019-12-07 15:42:18 its not just with anchor blocks
bug-reports 2019-12-07 15:42:27 i deleted my anchor blocks and it still flung me
general 2019-12-08 15:47:35 thsat slow
general 2019-12-08 15:47:40 my battleship can go faster than that
bug-reports 2019-12-08 15:48:23 i honestly dont care wat rick does with the game as long as the motor 2 flinging issue is fixed
bug-reports 2019-12-09 01:20:44 can u unupdate something
bug-reports 2019-12-09 01:21:05 cuz i rlly want to test my foldable battleship but i cant spawn it without getting flung
bug-reports 2019-12-09 01:21:47 but the last update broke motors
bug-reports 2019-12-09 22:02:56 my boat is incomplete but
bug-reports 2019-12-09 22:03:15 
bug-reports 2019-12-09 22:03:27 u can see the folding mechanism that uses motors and cameras
bug-reports 2019-12-09 22:03:36 and the turret is a motor 2 turret
bug-reports 2019-12-09 23:32:39 lol its my incomplete battleship
bug-reports 2019-12-09 23:32:44 foldable
bug-reports 2019-12-11 22:25:20 my a10 takes a few tries to spawn
bug-reports 2019-12-11 22:25:50 sometimes it spawns then flings
bug-reports 2019-12-11 22:26:11 but then it only flings a little bit then it freezes like an anchor block was activated and the speed meter is stuck at 270 something
bug-reports 2019-12-11 22:26:24 and there r motor 2s on the plane but not anchor blocks

bug-reports 2019-12-21 15:23:16 but it would be nice if they added an option to turn them all into individual 1 by 1 by 1 blocks so pvp is more realistic
bug-reports 2019-12-21 15:23:36 cuz rn a few shots will rip a huge chunk in my wings

plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:07:30 its just sorta stupid
plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:07:36 theres no good anticopy method
plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:07:45 unless u build a massive wall around ur whole build
plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:08:20 they could add an option to surround ur entire build with a wall
plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:08:25 thats invis to u
plane-crazy 2019-12-21 19:08:30 but other ppl cant see at all

plane-crazy 2020-02-22 06:06:11 but to copy this shit car
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:55:22 frick i forgot how to suggest
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:57:34 &suggest Add buttons/levers that can activate certain blocks. Make them so u dont have to sit in ur seat so u can interact with the build without the main pilot seat. This way you can open doors without have to run back to ur seat. If this is added, add an option to the buttons/levers that allows other players to use them too.
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:57:44 BRUH
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:57:55 i think the suggestion bot broke
help 2020-02-24 00:59:00 did the suggesting bot break

plane-crazy 2020-02-24 01:19:02 the others ive done before and i have 0 experience with walkers
general 2020-02-24 01:19:27 if u blacklist ppl the bomb will go through their ship
general 2020-02-24 01:19:40 just make sure it floats and when it goes through their ship itll float under it
general 2020-02-24 01:19:46 then manually detonate it

plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:13:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:13:29 thats nosediving
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:13:55 but up down wise
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:13:58 its too low
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:14:11 maybe add ballasts along the top
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:14:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:14:17 to sort of form a heavy "spine"
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:14:41 creativ i dont think thats the problem
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:14:51 i think its that the center of mass is way too low
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:15:03 u sure?
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:15:20 it still shouldnt dive tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 02:15:38 not with such a small distance between the centers
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:44:51 so i was making mini planes for my friends carrier
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:45:07 so i had a little fighter and a little b25
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:45:20 so u know sometimes when u spawn the builds freeze and the speed bar is full
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:45:30 and then u wait for a few sec and then everything spawns properly
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:45:51 well i got out of my main pilot seat in the fighter and hopped into the pilot seat in the b25
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:46:03 and then when everything spawned properly the planese morphed
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:51:15 another bug with the mini planes
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:51:38 the bomber wouldnt fly so i deleted the fighter to see where the center of mass and lift were
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:51:59 but the center of lift ended up on the tip of the left wing
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:52:10 i lifted the whole build to make sure there were no hidden blocks
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:54:02 this is after i deleted the fighter
bug-reports 2020-03-08 03:54:02 i always roll left

bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:02:35 im pulling up roblox
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:02:38 imma get a screenshot
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:02:52 its updating
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:01 
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:02 its wip
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:11 so the blue and red things r the "players"
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:22 and the legit player controls it from underneath
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:52 
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:00 so the player gets in a closes the doors
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:07 and then they can move using wasd
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:16 and the box is connected to the "player" up top
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:21 for me, the creator
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:26 i can move around fine
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:35 but for other players when they get in the box it barely moves
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:40 btw the box was not my idea
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:50 megladon made it for his game
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:59 and no not a connection problem
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:10 we switched boxes too
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:18 normally i play blue but i went to red
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:25 and both boxes work for me
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:29 but not for other players

bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:10:44 so the other players box is always glitchy
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:10:48 no matter which box i pick
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:11:01 when they sprint for some reason they glitch through the box walls and end up outside
creations-chat 2020-03-12 19:12:10 boi
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:21 its an anti lag mechanism i think
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:33 but it identifies the wrong part of the creation sometimes
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:49 so for anti lag it freezes the main body of the creation
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:31:15 it would be nice if rick removed it
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:31:21 id rather have functional pvp

bug-reports 2020-03-16 14:56:20 so basically allow parachutes to move through other blocks freely

bug-reports 2020-03-20 01:11:04 but i tried to close them but only a few of the pistons began retracting
bug-reports 2020-03-20 01:11:51 and then i press the keybind again and then the originally working pistons push and the supposedly broken pistons retract

creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:18:34 as striders
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:18:37 or magma cubes
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:19:48 what other nether mobs r there
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:19:53 i dont remember
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:32:49 the thing is only wing lights would be useful
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:33:06 other blocks would probably be too big to be mob sized
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 19:34:11 rope treads dont look that bad at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 19:34:30 and u can tighten and loosen them
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 19:45:23 slight issue with the rope treads is the corners of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 19:45:44 most of the blocks r normal blocks but then there r random wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 19:45:56 memes go into <#495286269459300364>
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:46:53 half wedges seem too tall
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 20:21:23 it would be more epicc if u could get all the treads to match
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 20:21:38 not sure if its possible tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:06:30 idk if i should use rope treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:06:44 rope treads seem pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:07:02 more tanky than motor treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:07:08 and easier and adjustable
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:07:18 but not all of the treads r the same
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:57:35 i honestly like rope treads now
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:57:42 i havent used them yet but they have potential
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 21:58:04 stronger, u can make it 1 block wide, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:00:22 u can actually make smoll treaded tons with them
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:47 did obc ever get his swoosplat to work
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:58:17 cuz i think the problem was that the motor for left right movement was to the right
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:58:21 i think it has to be under the center
general 2020-07-07 23:16:45 smh
general 2020-07-07 23:17:01 bruh i swear if roblox removes motor lock

plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:19:09 what r the cons of rope treads?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:19:11 they seem ok

general 2020-07-13 02:34:08 im no gave dev but something tells me that theres usually a limit to how much u can optimize something
general 2020-07-13 02:34:24 or else game devs would have completely lag free games
the-dump 2020-07-13 02:34:42 wait waht
general 2020-07-13 02:34:47 .
general 2020-07-13 02:34:52 this is absurd
general 2020-07-13 02:34:59 well not enough time has passed then
general 2020-07-13 02:35:05 he will optimize it when he wants to
general 2020-07-13 02:35:11 he doesnt need someone to suggest it
general 2020-07-13 02:35:26 im not faithless i just dont think its a nessecary suggestion
general 2020-07-13 02:35:53 yes
general 2020-07-13 02:36:00 the suggestion itself is absurd
general 2020-07-13 02:36:02 theres no need for it
general 2020-07-13 02:36:15 wha
general 2020-07-13 02:36:34 why would u need to suggest for lag reduction
general 2020-07-13 02:37:10 yes i agree lag reduction is good but u dont need to suggest it
general 2020-07-13 02:37:24 game devs will naturally reduce lag
general 2020-07-13 02:37:28 no need to suggest it
general 2020-07-13 02:37:38 smh
general 2020-07-13 02:37:41 misunderstanding
general 2020-07-13 02:37:46 its not faithlessness
general 2020-07-13 02:37:53 its me pointing out how unneeded the suggestion is
general 2020-07-13 02:38:30 yes ofc they would agree
general 2020-07-13 02:38:32 including the dev
general 2020-07-13 02:38:40 but my point is u dont need a suggestion for it
general 2020-07-13 02:38:47 he knows that lag should be reduced
general 2020-07-13 02:39:08 i think the fact that u think its nessecary to suggest that is absurd
general 2020-07-13 02:39:21 dammit i cant spell necessary
general 2020-07-13 02:40:35 bruh
general 2020-07-13 02:40:41 ur just suggesting the obvious
general 2020-07-13 02:40:56 whats the point of suggesting the obvious
general 2020-07-13 02:41:10 its like suggesting to fix a glitch
general 2020-07-13 02:41:29 ofc everyone wants a fast creation but for the time being just use conveyor engines
general 2020-07-13 02:41:32 smh
general 2020-07-13 02:41:35 ur missing my point
general 2020-07-13 02:41:37 my point is
general 2020-07-13 02:41:41 ur suggesting the obvious
general 2020-07-13 02:41:50 i never said lag is a glitch
general 2020-07-13 02:42:05 i said that suggesting for lag reduction is like suggesting for a bug fix
general 2020-07-13 02:42:13 ;-;
general 2020-07-13 02:42:20 sure go ahead and suggest it then
general 2020-07-13 02:42:32 im sure rick wouldnt have thought of lag reduction yet
general 2020-07-13 02:43:03 yes and?
general 2020-07-13 02:43:16 ...
general 2020-07-13 02:52:08 no cannons yet

general 2020-07-13 02:55:40 rip
general 2020-07-13 02:56:06 where was that suggestion about how non tracking rockets should be extra fast
general 2020-07-13 02:56:13 those would work as "cannons"
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 02:59:42 ur using them incorrectly
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 02:59:53 each side needs to come in by one block
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 03:00:04 it should be the smaller cylinder resting on top of the track
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 03:00:37 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 03:00:49 like the rlly small cylinder
