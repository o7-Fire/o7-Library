general 2022-07-16 19:29:04 is there a way to be able to use 2 keybinds with 2 control panels next to eachother, im trying to make a jet that can properly turn out of my own design ( i cant seem to use 2 at the same time)
general 2022-07-16 19:30:16 a jet of my own design that can properly turn
general 2022-07-16 19:30:36 a jet, which i designed, that can properly turn
general 2022-07-16 19:31:23 yeah im trying to have it be able to turn like jets in gta (same keybinds too)
general 2022-07-16 19:31:35 2 next to eachother wont let me use both at the same time
general 2022-07-16 19:32:07 idk ima test other keybinds my keybinds are wonky cuz numpad
