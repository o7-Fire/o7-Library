general 2020-10-20 00:59:40 finally could verify
general 2020-10-20 00:59:41 hi guys
general 2020-10-20 00:59:53 hows life
general 2020-10-20 01:00:41 ee
general 2020-10-20 01:00:53 i dont know much about planes
general 2020-10-20 01:00:56 but i have a lotsa plane
general 2020-10-20 01:01:01 rn been working on a spitfire
general 2020-10-20 01:01:02 gonna send pics
general 2020-10-20 01:02:14 Thats the spitfire so far, the tail was painfull to make  and i plan to give it custom motor control panels, and inside its got a ballast block so it can go downwards and land realisticly if its on low speed
general 2020-10-20 01:02:42 and it has a sliding cockpit
general 2020-10-20 01:02:50 ima send a vid
general 2020-10-20 01:03:37 oh wait
general 2020-10-20 01:03:45 how can i post it without it just being a download thing
general 2020-10-20 01:03:54 im not very experienced on discord
general 2020-10-20 01:04:24 https://streamable.com/393p69
general 2020-10-20 01:04:29 thanku
general 2020-10-20 01:04:47 it sometimes get jammed but thats realistic
general 2020-10-20 01:05:21 its the 3rd time i ever make a spitfire
general 2020-10-20 01:05:26 i firstly made a TRASH spitfire
general 2020-10-20 01:05:33 didnt fly well and always moved a bit to the right
general 2020-10-20 01:05:36 it was normal control panels
general 2020-10-20 01:05:55 and it had tnt barrel bombs and a normal dive bomb in middle, movable wheel 2x2 wheels (Wich are oversized and stupid)
general 2020-10-20 01:06:17 and the cockpit, in those times i learned a cockpit technique thats like how the cockpit worked on planes like bf 109 but
general 2020-10-20 01:06:24 it wasnt accurate to spitfire, anyways i used that on it
general 2020-10-20 01:06:30 i didnt even know about arm in key stuff
general 2020-10-20 01:06:36 so the spitfire EXPLODED ITSELF when shooting lol
general 2020-10-20 01:06:55 then  i made a new spitfire (wich i still conserve)
general 2020-10-20 01:07:43 this
general 2020-10-20 01:08:14 oh dang ur so right room
general 2020-10-20 01:08:24 the new version wings will terribly break
general 2020-10-20 01:08:33 hope it doesnt actually break
general 2020-10-20 01:08:44 i mean it only messed up my current finished spitfire
general 2020-10-20 01:08:54 but making a new spitfire might fix it
general 2020-10-20 01:09:07 thats why i started making the new (like 100 years after the update killed my current lmao)
general 2020-10-20 01:11:17 me, trying to wing walk my spitfire but recording lags me so badly it fails https://streamable.com/huah92

general 2020-10-20 01:43:18 i used to think the

general 2020-10-20 01:43:31 and i calculated
general 2020-10-20 01:43:35 1 block is 0.9 meters
general 2020-10-20 01:43:41 159 blocks is 130 meters
general 2020-10-20 01:43:48 and i damn made more than 159 blocks

creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:07:11 Uh thats easy, just stack wedges but 1 block more forward on top or do 2 in same spot and then 1 block more, depends on how much it has to advance
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:08:15 also its bcuz of my quality is low, you cant see the shadows, also im talking about the side lol, stacking wedges, as you can see i did that for the sides (Pic with good quality so yo ucan see no smoothness now)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:09:50 also i have been working on a extremely funny supermarine spitfire (Sliding cockpit, realistic control panels with motors, and a balalst block to give it weight)

creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:12:14 Heres a vid of it after started (bcuz it has motor locking, showing the propeller blurr, and the tail movement, and cockpit sliding)

creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:03:37 i talk about the concept, planes we're imagined even in 1500, bruh lol, also the first submarine 1771 and the first naval submarine with torpedoes 1890, the first blimp 1860, the first train 1820
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:04:44 also bro, with concept i dont mean WHEN DID THEY TRY TO BUILD THEM, and YEAH WE GOT CARS, CAR = CARRIAGE, and the real name of the ones you talk about (NOWADAYS ENGINE VEHICLES) Is automobile = wich means automatic movement, because of engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:05:48 car = carriage = horse powered wheeled vehicles
concept of a vehicle = when was it first imagined, for example planes: 1500s
automovile = automatic movement vehicle (wich is what we got nowadays AND GOT INVENTED IN 1885) 
also i NEVER SAID planes we're made before cars, read rightly
AND IM SAYING PLANES WE'RE IMAGINED, NOT BUILT, IMAGINED IN 1500S, I NEVER SAID THEY WE'RE BUILT IN 1500S, I SAID IMAGINED, THINKED ABOUT IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, THINKED OF THE IDEA OF A FLYING MACHINE
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:06:49 AND IM SAYING PLANES WE'RE IMAGINED, NOT BUILT, IMAGINED IN 1500S, I NEVER SAID THEY WE'RE BUILT IN 1500S, I SAID IMAGINED, THINKED ABOUT IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, THINKED OF THE IDEA OF A FLYING MACHINE,
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:07:50 also i already knew that, havent got anything from internet rn
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:08:51 game, we never said planes we're made before cars, we said planes we're touhg of before engined horseless vehicles
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:09:56 viratech, i said i havent googled anything rn, i didnt say i never googled those info and like i magically knew. also they we're actually started being imagined in 1500s, google about when we're planes first imagined
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:11:31 GODDAMN GOOGLE IS STUPID, IM GOOGLED WHEN DID PLANES WE'RE FIRST IMAGINED AND MORE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THE SAME QUESTION AND KEEPS SAYING WRIGHT FLYERS MADE THE FIRST PLANE, BUT IM NOT ASKING WHEN WE'RE PLANES FIRST MADE, IM GOOGLING WHEN WAS IT FIRST IMAGINED LMAO
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:12:34 DONE FINALLY FOUND THE INFO, leonardo davinci did the FIRST STUDIES of the possibility of making planes, and even tough about them before that*, in 1480 (also technically yes he was copying how birds looked like)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:13:54 also game, admit you we're wrong on thinking i was saying planes was made before cars, because i said when planes were first imagined, not made.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:14:58 and ill stop giving you defined explanations of my point and how you're wrong and how i didnt say planes we're made before cars and how i actually said how flying machines (aircraft, blimp) we're firstly imagined even before they imagined the idea of horseless carriages that could move by theirselves (what we know as nowadays, AUTOMOBILES, carriages that move by theirselves, without horses)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:16:12 also nice locomotive engine  bruh thats actually extremely realistic, i once made a system based on how train systems worked, to make flapping wings that didnt need 2 keys but just holding a key. (saddly it wasnt very effective by how airfoils work in plane crazy [Speed doesnt matter when you talk about airfoil flapping])
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:17:14 ok but look at my supercool supremarkine spriteoffer https://streamable.com/c6rrfl
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:19:21 also the mispell was in purpose, i just wanted to make it sound funny, also  i tough first engine was 1820 scremming also supremarkine spriteoffer evolved to supermarine spitfire MK IX https://streamable.com/m6bz84 WAIT OOPS THIS IS OUTDATED I DIDNT FIX THE TAIL PROBLEM YET

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:09 uhh i use mouse control on smallest planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:18 bcuz key controls take a lot to stabilize
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:28 and smaller the plane is = harder is to fit stuff like propeller blades to stabilize
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:29 no?

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:24:40 u can make the nose and back part more curvy
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:24:46 you can add ladders to windows so they look cool
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:24:48 and more
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:25:01 you can add horizontal laders on the ground
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:25:08 also no need to use the edge things to curve it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:25:13 just use normal wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:25:50 look
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:26:49 wedge curves
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:26:56 its not smooth but easy and very detailed and edge stuff is TOO LIMITED
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:27:22 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:27:25 wedge44

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:30:12 ik
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:30:35 captain how good are you building

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:02 eae
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:29 the tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:31 is horrible
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:33 no offense
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:39 motorlocking is a good idea in ur situation
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:58 just do normal curve
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:05 and put tail in the normal curve
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:11 and remove the central things so u can stuff the tail in
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:17 and ignore theres holes that are blocky where the tail is at
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:07 u can do that for tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:07 look at this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:13 basicly same thing as the front curve
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:15 but let a spot for tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:24 it'll saddly be blocky in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:33:28 but its better than what u did before
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:05 man
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:08 you see the curve is like
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:10 wedges in middle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:13 and edges in the corners
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:24 remove the  wedges and put blocks in their spots (normal blocks)
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:29 and put wings intop of the normal blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:32 just like i showed at image

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:19 disconnector walls
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:22 also no i didnt combine the bombs
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:27 the idea is that the bombs arent combined
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:35 they're 1 tnt block with a wing panel each
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:51 they also get stuck tough
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:53 so i got an idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:55 NOT A BOMBER PLANE
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:57 gun bomber plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:01 it shoots the bombs as bullets!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:12 and they spread a lot
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:17 and they go trough ships!

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:52:23 antinerfer
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:52:28 how do you make those?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:52:31 camera folding?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:52:52 if you use motorlock then how u angle them, it would just glitch out if has no camera folding and uses other thing for angling
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:52:55 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:53:00 camera folding, i kinda hate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:53:02 bc it doesnt save
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:53:05 and its kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:53:18 i preffer motor folding, its not as accurate or good but its simple
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:17 ah yes!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:20 i did it!!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:31 i finished
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:32 the
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:34 stern motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:56:53 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:57:11 also why did u use tnt
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:57:14 what makes tnt usefull on that
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:57:47 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:58:01 u got no way
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:58:03 the plot is too small
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:58:09 36 blocks up, 51 blocks lenght and thickness
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:58:18 ur in trouble :/
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:58:50 just do manual!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:59:23 you can..
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 19:59:42 doesnt have to be smooth
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:00:46 ok so
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:00:54 listen
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:00:57 this is how to do it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:01:49 i call it shrinking arts
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:09 see? i call it shrinking arts
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:14 no smoothness but it still looks awesome and its 100% more simple than camera locking
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:42 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:43 yes maybe
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:44 IK
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:44 OOH
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:48 make 2 shells
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:54 make them all have
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:57 the shrinking arts design
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:03:58 both
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:00 complete both
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:05 and then rotate 1 of them 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:10 and it might smooth it more
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:22 or- nvm
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:23 it wont wokr
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:26 wont smooth it more
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:36 just do the shrinking arts thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:48 works for anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:52 i used shrinking arts for my mbk bow
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:55 my uss avocet bow
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:04:56 and more
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:05:01 shrinking arts usefull for surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:05:08 i
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:05:15 i used no triangle wedge or any of that shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:05:33 i used corner wedges and half corner wedges, wedge types, and half wedge types
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:01 so you see
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:04 the
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:09 the thing is 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:13 the main part that is just curve
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:15 the outline
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:19 amke it 3 blocks thick until 1 block in the end
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:06:24 at the end you can use a half corner wedge down
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:07:49 like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:08:00 basicly the end
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:08:07 3 blocks thick and use half corner wedge down at the end
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:09:24 look at the image closely
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:09:46 you see the end tip?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:09:50 its like
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:02 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:03 i
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:08 just use half wedges and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:12 and do like the
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:14 normal huge cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:22 but start making it less thick by a slab
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:26 until it reaches to the end
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:10:41 i technically said how
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:01 no no
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:03 that part has to be
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:05 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:14 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:22 the outline
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:24 that you already built
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:27 has to be 3 blocks thick not 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:33 just like the cylinder that it comes from
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:11:35 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:04 ur doing this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:18 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:21 THAT
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:21 YES
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:22 u gotta do this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:12:58 antiner
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:13:03 can i get a rest from helpin u so
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:13:07 i can work on my mbk's stern?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:13:09 its pretty wip
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:13:30 i guess thats an awesome pretty cool yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:17 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:19 awesome
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:25 wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:27 remove 1 line
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:34 also use
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:35 alkso those are
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:38 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:43 so you shouldnt have to do 1x2 half
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:48 you had to do 1x1 half wedges there
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:52 up and down ones
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:18:55 so it looked normal
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:19:23 you see you did thios
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:19:30 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:19:49 u had to do this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:14 basicly, ur lowering everything by 1 slab
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:27 see thats why it breaks
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:33 thats why its not gonna work
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:38 the other normal wedges will have to stay like that
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:41 to eternity
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:47 thats why u gotta do whats showed on the 2nd image
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:20:52 half wedge down and half wedge up
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:21:12 not
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:21:20 listen
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:21:22 red = 1x2 wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:21:29 green = half wedge 1x1 down
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:21:50 blue = half wedge (its at normal wedge section and its named like that) but you can also use half wedge 1x1 up
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:22:22 its a sicle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:22:23 cycle*
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:02 u gotta do that
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:07 ALMOST remove the 1st layer
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:29 the idea is that you see the 1x4 is like 1x2 half wedges, 1 ontop of a slab and 1 ontop of nothing
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:33 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:44 but keep the 2nd
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:46 just clone the 2nd
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:49 into 1st
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:55 keep going
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:23:57 its a cycle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:24:41 oh

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:27:04 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:27:06 yes!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:27:10 until you meet a layer end

general 2020-11-29 20:48:12 guys
general 2020-11-29 20:48:16 plane crazy is OUR game
general 2020-11-29 20:49:14 at-ct = a test combat tank
general 2020-11-29 20:49:37 atct is better
general 2020-11-29 20:49:44 also imperialenf0rcer did
general 2020-11-29 20:49:54 oooh
general 2020-11-29 20:49:58 so theres shit in 2020?
general 2020-11-29 20:49:59 yum!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:50:25 wth what
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:50:28 u dont know motorlocin?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:50:51 ok so
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:50:54 this will be mental pain for you
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:51:17 but u dont have big skill on it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:51:18 man ur a pro and have more ranks than me
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:51:21 and i do excessive shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:51:36 an i mean deck motorlocking is VERY NEEDED for ships
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:51:38 so they look good
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:19 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:21 pain
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:27 also the railing isnt camera lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:38 they're just half wedge down and half wedge 2 folded
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:55 i dont use camera lock, it SUCKS
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:52:57 its stupid
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:05 it doenst save and its also too simple for making stuff detailed
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:14 it kinda breaks the purpose of trying hard to detail stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:23 it makes everything smooth and its like a miracleous feature its just
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:25 for noobs to have pro stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:34 i see camera folding/locking as something cringe
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:53:50 something megacringe
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:14 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:17 in pro hands
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:27 it permits to do details, pros know arent possible with motorlock or anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:42 camera folding is just like anything can be normally done with motorlock or a motor fold into something way simpler and for noobs
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:46 yo
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:48 blueparrot!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:51 thats a funny name!
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:54 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:55:58 some guy made a camera lock tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:56:36 ur basicly this bebe
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:56:39 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:05 thats a mutant eclectus
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:11 oh thats super sad
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:16 mine died in starts of 2019
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:27 but then in middle 2019 i got new birbs
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:29 2 birbs
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:31 and in 2020 early
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:35 or middle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:36 idk
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:38 i got another birb
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:41 a very fat birb
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:54 all of them are amazona ochrocephalas
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:57:56 also no they dont
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:05 if you take care rightly of macaws/parrots they can last 50 years
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:13 by other side, cockatoos can last even 80 YEARS
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:23 basicly more than average humans
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:28 average human max age - 70 years
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:36 but well
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:39 thats not average cockatoo age
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:46 average cockatoo age is around 20-30 like normal parrots
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:50 reason: predating
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:58:57 they wont survive that long in the wild by predation
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:59:20 budgie
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:59:27 the name of the documental is just budgerigar
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:59:32 im sure their name isnt budgerigar
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:59:41 wait nvm
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 20:59:52 they last 10 years
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:00:20 borb

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:02:00 also the parrot is female eclectus
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:02:05 i meant forgot name bc of the word cheeks

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:14:21 answering
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:14:22 ppl
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:14:50 i have red baron's triplane
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:15:07 but not lifesized, mini sized
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:15:10 big sized*
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:00 also
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:02 have in mind it is a
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:04 PRETTY OLD BUILD
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:08 it uses no motorlock or anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:09 its super old
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:14 its key controlled
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:29 and its stabilized with propeller blades, no ballast blocks or helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:16:33 https://streamable.com/qb4ya1
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:17:14 key control permits very cool custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:17:21 mouse control otherwise is pretty good for super small planes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:17:36 key control permits squadrons that arent camera connected
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:18:30 ok so
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:18:34 https://streamable.com/jr4jvy
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:18:43 had to cut vid bc it lagged a lot in recording
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:18:49 ill start recording again when they are on air
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:19:53 the 5th derrailed by the lag
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:08 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:09 captain
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:15 if ur gonna make so small red barons
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:21 why dont u make it into a division out of 5 or 4
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:28 divisions are parts of squadrons formed by 4-6 planes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:29 https://streamable.com/08vbp5
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:20:48 they're 5 lifesized migs, they arent mini
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:21:04 i also put camera on and jump off seat and get back into it to get the funny 3rd camera tough im not in the plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:22:32 ae
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:22:36 the back part of the seat
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:22:43 check back part of seat
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:22:48 it might hit the upper motor
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:23:18 should i make a ww1 plane squadron?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 21:23:21 nvm bad idea

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:36 yes nice kayak
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:39 i once did a boat
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:41 that worked only by
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:42 paddles
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:46 like the kayak's paddles
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:53 they did do the S P I N
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:28:56 but saddly it was too slow
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:02 4 paddles on each side
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:05 yet only 10 speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:13 or 6
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:14 i forgot
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:44 have gotten so good with motorlock i randomly managed to make a gun tube
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:47 for the autocannona
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:29:49 cannon*
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:30:04 and like 2 days before i was questioning "how did this guy make a gun tube for his tancccc"
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:31:16 the MBK has 2 main guns with 87MM caliber main guns, around 20MM (i forgot) Double cannon anti-air guns, and an multi-purpose (Anti-air and ship attacking) 37MM autocannon
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:31:28 i have only made a main gun and the autocannon
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:31:31 i plan to do the AA next
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:31:48 me old mbk be like: uglyness 100%
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:14 fuck the plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:26 it has an antenna onfront, that might work
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:51 kayak colour
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:53 thats
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:56 255 210 50
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:32:59 try that
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:33:02 or 255 190 50
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:33:51 my mbk better than any other mbk every built on plane crazy (bc its the only lololololol)
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:15 tanc
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:38 .
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:41 tsar tank is a thing?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:46 so like tsar tank is a threadless tank?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:48 MAN
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:00:56 ALWAYS HAS BEEN MY DREAM TO FIND A TANK DOESNT USE THREADS
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:19 armoured cars arent tanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:23 they're just armoured cars
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:39 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:43 it is suppossed to have threads
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:02:54 it doesnt count as a threadless tank anyway
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:03:02 its just an ability that permits it to keep going if it looses threads
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:03:19 i want a tank suppossed to drve without threads
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:03:26 if i ever made a BT-42 i would have to make it have threads
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:03:29 bc naturally it HAS THREADS
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:19 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:23 the wheels even have
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:28 car wheel thingies
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:32 AWESOME THAT MEANS I SHOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:39 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:42 im rn working on a
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:04:43 b o a t
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:08:27 steerin wheel?!?!?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:10:37 russians also have BT-7A
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:10:49 it does same thing that the  bt-42 does
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:23:44 my mom showing me something gross when im a 5 year old like a dead person: 👍 
my mom showing me something gross when im a 13 year old like someone injuried: 👎

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:05:15 e
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:05:24 put half wedge down
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:05:28 and half triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:21 yes antiner
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:23 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:26 in like other way
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:34 rotate it 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:39 make it face to the middle
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:14:55 no right
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:00 also
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:08 yay yay yay!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:12 i finished the anti-air guns
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:19 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:21 to the other side
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:23 also you see the
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:29 you see that if you rotate it that awy
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:31 theres left a hole?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:37 /thats bc for the middle parts
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:15:43 you used a half wedge up
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:07 ok so
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:08 you see this shit?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:12 the red shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:20 i need you to turn it into a half wedge (Thats on wedge section)
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:25 bc it is a half wedge 1x1 up
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:27 and so it leaves a hole
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:33 half wedge (the one in wedge section) doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:17:55 it would look like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:25 you did wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:25 also no
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:26 i need le thing to looke like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:30 very wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:33 its the other block not that block
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:42 the block painted in red is part of the middle outline
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:45 not the corners
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:18:56 you see the middle outline thats 3 blocks wide?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:00 thats where u gotta put the half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:08 not in the corner parts that we're working on
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:23 compare
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:26 the last image i sent you
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:28 to the last u sent
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:19:35 and you'll understand whats wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:20:37 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:20:38 you see
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:20:41 im gonna send u a pic
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:20:44 of what u gotta do in the
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:20:47 middle outline
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:01 this is basicly what u did
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:05 need u to do this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:06 NO
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:11 get rid of that half wedge thats on the corner
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:12 right now
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:13 kill it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:14 burn it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:17 crucificate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:19 idk
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:20 explode it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:22 NOW
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:28 look at the imagine im gonna send you closely
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:30 the last image
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:31 i sent you
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:34 try recreating that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:21:36 for ur middle outline
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:22:11 ae
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:22:12 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:23:02 
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:23:05 you see whats called shit?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:23:12 thats what i want you to turn it into a half wedge (on wedge section)
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:23:21 bc it is a half wedge up 1x1 and it leaves a slab sized hole under
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:24:10 do this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:24:46 then this
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:01 red = half corner wedge up
green = half wedge down 1x1
blue = half triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:09 they're all on half block section
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:25 i feel like i have helped you more than what the others did
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:29 bc this doenst only help you with this build
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:39 this teaches you how to do decent hulls and extrange curves for plates and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:54 as you see i used it for my mbk's bow hull
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:25:56 kk show me
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:26:51 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:26:55 now you see
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:26:56 uh
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:26:59 you see
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:27:10 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:27:27 but if you cant put a block under one of them, check what block kind are them, and if they are a half wedge up, change em to normal half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:27:48 i have been trying
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:27:51 for a very long time
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:27:55 TO FIND WHERE'S THE FUNNELS OF THE MBK
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:28:03 but theres no smoke nowhere even in war thunder gameplays
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:28:06 i just cant find the funnels
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:28:23 that means its a half wedge up, change it to half wedge (Wedge section)
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:28:27 just like you did for the other side
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:28:37 https://streamable.com/5aqeow MBK Double cannon anti-airs are done
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:07 the 37MM autocannon be pretty slow
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:11 also i used all the 10 guns
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:20 the autocannon has 6 guns, the other smol guns have 2 each
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:30 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:31 torque is max
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:38 but speed is about 1 or 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:42 bc it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:44 want it to be realistic
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:58 the autocannon is 1 speed same as the main guns, the anti-air is 2 speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:29:59 awesome
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:11 now you just gotta repeat the same process on all corners (Wich wont take as long bc now u already know how to do it)
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:41 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:44 also use motorlock for the tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:49 make same thing as the nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:52 and then motorlock the tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:54 wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:54 so-
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:30:59 but u gotta remove the whoole back fold
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:03 and motorlock it a bit more under
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:07 so theres space to build the tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:16 bc if you do it in the place it already is there wont be space for tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:50 you gotta
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:51 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:52 do what i show in the image
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:58 you see the right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:31:59 thats what u have
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:06 i want you to remove the fold and move it a lot under
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:11 and space it out with motorlocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:16 so then it would come back up by the motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:28 but make sure there will be still space for the top tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:34 we are doing this to give space for the top tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:32:38 under tail*
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:09 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:18 only the back part fold
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:27 only 1 of the folds is gonna be motorlocked to be pulled up
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:31 bc its only the back
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:38 we are doing this to give space to the tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:44 but have in mind
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:51 u gotta pull the blimp up into the plot limit
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:33:54 with move tool
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:34:07 and make sure theres space for the top tail, remember we are doing this to give space to under tail, make sure this doesnt make us n
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:34:19 then need to give space AGAIN just to get it right for under tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:34:39 ur gonna move the whoole back part down, and leave space for the top and back tail
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:34:40 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:34:41 ur gonna do that
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 00:35:00 kk

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:48:37 pepsi
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:48:40 my mbk is almost done
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:48:43 its technically done
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:48:56 i just have to add details, internal turning gear and engines, and stabilize it with ballast
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:49:03 and railing on the stern
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 20:57:26 ´ppepsi
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:05:24 ae
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:05:45 so u guys cut images and compare to ur stuff to make it perfect?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:05:47 coughen
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:05:54 gotta try that for my mbk
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:06:16 btw my mbk is almost done, i just need to add deck details, masts and ropes, and stabilize it and make it able to move
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:06:21 and finish railing
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:07:21 mbk go br
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:07:37 i think mbk isnt thick enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:07:49 ill leave it like that today
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:08:11 ill work on it more tomorrow (today i fixed an error, everything was on the front part ALOT, so i used motorlock techniques to move everything 3 blocks back)
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:08:32 i plan to atleast do railing on the back part only tomorrow bc
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:08:39 its gonna be pretty hard since its folded
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:08:43 and it needs a lot of motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:08:48 also theres
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:09:00 TONS OF TONS OF TONS OF TONS of exposed motors in the exterior bc of railing
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:09:06 cant do anything about it
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:09:15 thas better than having fucking stupid lader railing
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:09:29 counting on this is x2 times the normal size so i can add more detail than just that
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:10:37 i tested mbk at a vip server to see how many damage autocannons did, the MBK is BRUTAL, it deals a lot of dmg, takes down entire block beams instantly with the autocannons and the AA guns, and i mean its a total of 10 guns makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:10:43 also purified thats pretty detailed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:10:54 and it uses a pretty cool style i dont use, using edges and corners
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:11:22 also wait wth camera lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:11:36 camera lock for engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:11:40 thats cool and looks so complicate
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:11:42 complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:11:54 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:12:02 i dont use camera lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:12:26 also bruh tnt? i mean disconnectors are good too, and that would only work for vip servers so like u cant flex it lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:12:50 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:12:50 and no pvp servers, u would just damage urself
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:13:00 mbk is full of motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:13:26 pain.png
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:13:38 this is full of pain, i had tonelades of pain, very painful, too much pain, pain and confusion and screaming
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:01 just look at that fucked up shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:06 its painful to look at
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:09 it was so painful to do
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:13 counting on im a motorlock noob
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:21 so like imagine suffering daily to get a motorlock to work
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:22 pfffffft
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:28 yes thats what happened to me today
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:44 tryna understand what the heck was happening when i was tryna push everything intop of the deck 3 blocks backwards
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:14:53 with motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:11 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:14 PFFFFFFFFT
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:19 guys
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:27 i think piston lock didnt get fixed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:38 before it got broken the last time, pistons locked stuff downwards 0.1 stud
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:15:49 after the motorlock got fixed i tested, and piston lock was not fixed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:01 it didnt do anything
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:03 so bruv
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:07 i meant studs
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:08 not blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:11 im stupid
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:28 funky
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:16:43 yo + joe = yoe mama
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:01 yeah, this is big brain time
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:21 i once did
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:25 a super hypercomplicated motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:32 and then noticed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:35 i could've done that detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:37 without motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:17:44 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:02 but i dont remember in what was it
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:29 half triangle wedge down doesnt exist
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:32 half triangle wedge does
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:42 why would they name it down IF THERES NOT GONNA BE UP
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:43 lel
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:48 also why the heck up doesnt exist
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:51 very STUPID
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:18:54 blame rickje
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:05 we also need half cylinder 2 up
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:19 we also need half edges
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:23 or inverted corner
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:26 whatever its called
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:29 man what if we're lazy to do fuck
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:19:33 fucking motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:20:02 yos
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:20:07 tough with bad qualities
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:20:11 shadows are stupid and stuff looks smooth
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:20:13 without that
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:20:48 my old mbk so dumb i hate it
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:01 doe
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:01 does
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:04 that bc
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:05 thats bc
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:06 it is HUGE
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:10 very huge model
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:14 with no small details needed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:18 if you made a lifesized cessna
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:20 you would need like
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:28 10000 motorlocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:36 to make the small details right
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:21:50 like just making a top glass thats nivelated to the wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:14 i needed 6 locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:19 just to place rightly the mbk streamlines
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:28 i know vip
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:30 the thing i meant is
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:33 theres a difference
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:39 between plane crazy lifesized and oversized vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:52 my spitfire for example, i've used a calculator page to calculate that it is x2.5 times the normal size
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:22:56 if you do soemthing like super oversized
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:08 theres a chance of you wont need even 1 motorlock to do a small detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:14 bc it would become a huge detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:24 i made my mbk x2 the size to make the main guns possible same as other details
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:36 1 block = 0.9 meters
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:50 dare you did that bigger than normal, look at the sails in the other pic
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:23:59 the ropes holding the sails still we're 1 block thick
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:04 fucking 90 cm ropes
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:12 so yes im sure its oversized
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:22 look at the other pic
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:34 
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:37 you see the things
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:39 that are like sticks
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:42 around the sails
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:45 .
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:46 what?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:51 then how you did it without motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:24:57 unless the sails are fucking flat nvm
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:25:33 how thick are the ropes that are keeping the sails into the mast then?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:25:44 also that thing does actually have more folds
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:25:51 i dont understand folds as motors that joint HUGE PARTS
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:25:54 i understand folds as
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:02 LITERAL EVERYTHING THATS A MOTOR RELATED TO MAKE SOMETHING LOOK RIGHT
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:10 plane wings that are angled are FOLDS
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:17 the front stick is A FOLD
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:21 my mbk railing use FOLDS
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:25 its still a fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:29 bc its folding something so it goes in a right spot
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:37 unfolding*
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:44 fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:26:52 i use motors to fold my railing rightly
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:03 AND GOES INTO OTHER.
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:08 after deployed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:23 oh right
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:33 hmm yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:33 folding is when a paper is folded by the half and its unfolded fully
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:37 then its 10% a fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:48 and 90 angle folds are just 50% a fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:52 hmmm yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:27:55 they're still FOLDS
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:28:04 laughs in big brain
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 21:28:20 actually nvm

general 2020-12-01 23:30:45 fucking cool boat im maken still wip
general 2020-12-01 23:32:23 ae
general 2020-12-01 23:32:45 dunnv
general 2020-12-01 23:50:59 give the fuso an extra tall santa hat
general 2020-12-01 23:51:09 bc of its extra tall bridge
general 2020-12-01 23:54:52 ima loose faith in humanity if nobody builds this
general 2020-12-01 23:55:16 extra tall musashi
general 2020-12-02 00:20:46 guys
general 2020-12-02 00:20:52 i think fuso class is possible to build
general 2020-12-02 00:20:59 in ro scale
general 2020-12-02 00:21:04 1 block = 0.9 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:21:13 hull is 16 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:21:27 draft is 8.7 meters and not draft part is 7.25 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:21:35 so it gives 15.95 meters wich is super close to 16 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:21:48 so hull would atleast be 17 blocks each piece
general 2020-12-02 00:21:58 17 + 17 is 34
general 2020-12-02 00:22:06 plot height is 38 blocks i think
general 2020-12-02 00:22:29 so fuso class is possible if all ontop of deck like structures (Except for guns maybe) are motorlocked or folded
general 2020-12-02 00:24:28 wait
general 2020-12-02 00:24:31 nvm fuso class not possible
general 2020-12-02 00:24:33 beam is 28 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:24:39 and plot thickness is 51
general 2020-12-02 00:24:47 28 blocks is not even enough
general 2020-12-02 00:24:52 1 block = 0.9 meters
general 2020-12-02 00:24:57 30 blocks atleast
general 2020-12-02 00:25:03 30 + 30 givse 60
general 2020-12-02 00:25:11 and you need to leave a space of atleast 3 blocks between each fold
general 2020-12-02 00:25:14 fuso class impossible
general 2020-12-02 00:26:41 bruh
general 2020-12-02 00:26:44 i was gonna get a
general 2020-12-02 00:26:48 huge dose of nostalgia
general 2020-12-02 00:26:50 with speedrun 4

plane-crazy 2020-12-02 18:13:01 mbk almost done, i just have to add some more detail to the masts and add deck detail, the rest is making it able to move and be stable
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 18:14:15 hey
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 18:14:18 james
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 18:14:20 what do u think about me mbk
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 18:15:13 it has 2 main guns each with 1 rocket and 2 tnt, an autocannon with 1 tnt and 6 guns, and 2 AA guns each with 2 guns and 1 tnt, and depth charges on the back (wich are decorative but have tnt to explode)
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:29 yo my energy died so i couldnt answer, it does look like a submarine but its a real ww2 russian gunboat, war thunder also has it
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:22 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:24 fabric is light
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:29 and i discovered that yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:33 i didnt know
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:34 that fabric was
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:36 light as fuck
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:46 i learned that it is light yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:49 also it
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:51 it can be hit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:00 i once hit one with fireworks using my rosie the rocketeer
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:15 if it ever got hit once by my mbk autocannon
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:18 it would break into shreds
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:23 that shit has literal 6 guns motorlocked
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:26 and i tested it
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:31 it takes down blocks instantly
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:55 also this means we are in an apocalypsis now
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:12 it has no wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:15 wings give a speed limit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:18 did you guys know that?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:32 if you place no wings on something and it has super rockets or any thrust type, it WONT HAVE A SPEED LIMIT
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:37 it will speed up infinitely
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:38 but if you add wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:44 for example propellers have
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:49 280 max speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:58 and super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:04 have 490 max speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:18 super fast mouse controlled accurate guns
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:26 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:29 guns can get rid of em
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:32 fabric has low hp
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:41 and 10 motorlocked guns
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:50 in an mouse controlled weapon
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:54 designed to be accurate
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:03 and someone good at calculating distance and bullet gravity affection
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:05 can take down those shits
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:19 its like shooting at where a plane is going, there will be a point where the bullets hit if it doesnt change direction
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:16:25 damn that mast thick 😳
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:16:36 thickness 100%
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:16:57 man you could've just used a fucking motor and trails or half wedges or any of those shit but that thing is TOO BIG
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:17:01 also what destroyer is that?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:17:27 im making this
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:17:35 very cool boat
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:18:50 ye
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:00 alssso
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:09 i think i met the guy who invented the shitcraft op thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:37 bc i told him whats the point of being unfair in pvp if you're not gonna anyways have fun, its an ezkill, its not a fun fight, its a fast death.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:38 and he told me he
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:41 was working o nmaking
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:45 the most op things
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:46 on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:48 or-
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:49 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:51 i forgot name but
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:54 im sure it wasnt stalker santa
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:01 he had a green cube head
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:08 and he was making black crafts
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:17 he showed me a cube that was mouse controlled and worked based on a piston engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:32 and a flying helicopter thing that moved at huge speeds and turned easily and used cutters to slice shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:58 and something PRETTY similar to the image you showed, deathcraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:03 oh captain, thats ez
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:15 use motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:18 motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:20 is awesome for that
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:23 make it servo and toggle
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:35 and do shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:56 hey imagine plane crazy official server admins
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:59 moderating the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:22:13 and slapping ppl with shredders that cant confirm having other builds else than shredder
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:22:28 or slapping ppl with lag machines and shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:22:41 like getting rid of their saves as a punishment, but can negotiate at the discord server
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:07 and like stealth mods
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:15 that are just around slapping random kiddos
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:20 without showing signs of being a mod
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:48 and so the kiddos will start building lag machines, over powered glitches, and male organs or snfw stuff and shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:59 and so the mods: so.. you've choosen death
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:11 guys
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:15 if you ever got chance to build a
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:18 HYPER GIGANTIC SHIP
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:22 what would you build?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:28 Freedom ship or project habakkuk
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:41 or just being stupid overrated idiots and build the shitty titanci
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:46 titanic
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:24:57 wich would be a waste of the opportunity bc the plot would permit you to make even 2 km ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:23 not really
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:28 it would be same thing as normal blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:30 just using ice
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:34 or wait ice melts fast to lava spitters?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:35 ice material
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:53 also freedom ship wouldnt be pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:27:19 guys would it be cool to have cannons? just normal guns but the bullets are actually modelled and they have a reload time, not like not reloading until last ammo disappears like what the shitty rockets do
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:27:27 and they arent machineguns
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:27:41 but they deal big dmg (basically pierce fully any block)
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:27:52 dealing inf dmg to the blocks hit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:35 if you make a limb
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:41 thats divided on 2 parts
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:43 thats using 2 motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:45 that shit is forbidden bc
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:54 if you use 1 motor for something heavy as shit now imagine 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:28:55 it freaks out
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:29:14 if you used 2 motors for each joint in a turret way, it would be stable (not like literal stacking the motors bc that would make it way stupider)
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:30:20 you decide that
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:30:39 if its mouse controlled, prefferabily 1 unpowered
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:30:52 the blue is right
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:30:57 i love ur pfp

the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:52 that is NOTHING RELATED TO BUILDING WHITELIST
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:58 but it also could be called pvp blacklist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:18 my idea was a blacklist/whitelist that makes you not able to damage the player blacklisted/whitelisted meanwhile they also cant damage you, in PVP
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:25 i already shared it at
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:28 suggestions
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:37 but the fucking ppl said whitelist wont be added blah blah
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:43 and me be like: bruh its not building whitelist its pvp whitelist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:55 also them: *gives a chat on why building whitelist isnt possible*
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:56:32 hi
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:57:07 i see.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:57:18 i didnt know they we're acalled prairie falcon but whatever
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:31 warship more like warshit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:33 planes better
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:40 warships: you are nothing without us
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:42 planes: why
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:48 warships: you need us to land in the ocean
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:59:58 seaplanes: permit us to introduce our selves
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:00:05 warships: what about ressupply
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:00:11 planes: *start praising warship*
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:30:52 ae
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:30:56 i have noticed
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:00 i have to move everything on my mbk
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:04 2 blocks backwards
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:05 again
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:08 except the back main gun
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:18 or 3 blocks ill check tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:36 i anyways finished the masts
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:50 but by the position of masts and more stuff i noticed i have to move everything ondeck backwards 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:57 or maybe not
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:31:58 not sure
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:32:18 but the front main gun and distance of the back main gun to the autocannon proves i have to move everything except back main gun 2 blocks back
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:32:31 and its gonna be pain, motorlocking, and messing with rope configuration
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:35:48 so
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:35:51 wish me luck
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:35:58 im gonna have pain tomorrow

general 2020-12-02 22:39:43 im getting pinged but i dont know where i'am being pinged
general 2020-12-03 15:54:32 ae
general 2020-12-03 15:54:33 hello
general 2020-12-03 15:54:35 how to suggest
general 2020-12-03 15:54:38 ok
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:54:41 ?shelp
general 2020-12-03 15:58:19 OH NO
general 2020-12-03 15:58:22 SHIT
general 2020-12-03 15:58:27 I FORGOT THAT THE SUGGESTIONS NEEDED A
general 2020-12-03 15:58:32 FORMAT
general 2020-12-03 15:58:36 IT DIDNT SAY IN SUGGESTION STUFF
general 2020-12-03 15:58:39 AAAAAA
general 2020-12-03 15:58:39 I HAVE AGES I DONT SUGGEST
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:59:30 uh my friend wanted it
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:59:50 he really needs those (not for a blimp or hot air balloon, maybe to enhance sinking mechanisms)
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:00 its the simplest idea i've got in mind
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:05 i hope its not impossible to add
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:13 ill ask why he needs em
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:42 not really
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:47 he doesnt make blimps or any of that shit
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:51 he makes boats
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:59 im sure its related to sinking mechanisms
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:05 Oh
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:15 so he didnt have to spam
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:17 helium everywhere
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:21 for automatic self destruct
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:30 thats what he said not sure what it means
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:24 ooh
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:28 so his reasons for helium tanks
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:37 is that he has a key to make ballast stop going up
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:40 when the ship self destructs
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:10 so it can sink automatically and not float up by the loss of weight bc hes gonna need helium to stabilize his ship as its too heavy and ballast tanks stabilize it but sink it farther and farther
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:33 so afterall its not because hes a bad builder
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:43 its because he actually needs them and theres something impossible to do without them
general 2020-12-03 16:08:52 i finished
general 2020-12-03 16:08:56 part of my mbk
general 2020-12-03 16:09:01 i only have to make deck detail and make it fucking move
general 2020-12-03 16:09:53 plane crazy if u wanna see it
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:10:22 Guys im so close to finish our boat
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:10:38 so what do u think, i only have to detail the deck and make OUR boat move
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:10:58 it uses no camera lock bc camera lock is shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:15 no its shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:19 it hypersimplifies stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:23 and makes stuff hyperdetailed
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:30 ruins the idea of trying hard to be able to detail something
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:47 i see
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:11:56 but i still think its shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:12:48 its harder to fucking make all cameras look to somewhere again every time you come another day
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:13:02 its not wood you see
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 16:13:06 mbk had a metallic deck

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:35:18 Depth charges BOOM
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:00 it uses rope locking

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:14 ae im lazy to do the camouflage version
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:20 i use war thunder images and vids to make it
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:28 tough i firstly discovered bc of i was looking for small ww2 ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:39 and meet myself with drawn images of mbk with lenght and stuff data
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:42 not bc of war thunder
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:36:53 and its still wip i still gotta finish deck detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:37:09 man camera locking looks godlike
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:37:15 but i still think its cringe!
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:42:20 ae
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:42:25 my migs are funny
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:42:33 bc they do war thunder avoiding maneuvers

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:01 my mbk had to be 40 blocks to give 36 meters in ro-scale
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:19 but
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:22 40 blcoks is too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:27 main guns would have to have no interior
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:30 AA guns would be impossible
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:34 detailing would be infernal
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:37 so i made mbk double the size
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:38 80 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:44 blueparrot
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:47 i used to hate making boats
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:49 bc i didnt know how
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:48:53 until i got bored and made a bote
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:00 and now i kinda main botes more than planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:07 thats the point
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:21 atleat u got a big build thats ez to get in pvp but its fun to rekt pros that also do same not op shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:46 imagine fucking shitting an enemy 153 block ship with a 102 block ship
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:47 super funny
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:49:56 also i meant in lenght not total amount
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:03 my mbk is 80 blocks lengt
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:06 yes u can
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:12 my mbk has an OP autocannon that takes blocks down INSTANTLY
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:23 and my old mbk thats ugly had fireworks so in close range it was super OP SHIT
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:33 and motorboats and hydrofoils are annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:36 i have a g-5 motorboat
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:50:42 shredders cant get it and it always slaps big boats with torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:05 eh
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:08 just make a fucking
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:11 amphibious tank-battleship
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:13 that has threads
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:15 and goes on water an land
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:20 or do a fucking amphibious car or tank or some shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:51:28 or make an hovercraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:09 wait
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:13 make a hoverekrafct
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:27 hovercrafts use wind that go trough their propeller into floor to hover over floor a little
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:32 they also go trough water
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:45 u can use hover thrusters for those (but add a low amount so if they go trough a extremely hard hill they crash)
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 16:52:56 nicolas

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:21 thats
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:29 thats a fucking experimental plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:34 why will you give it camouflage?
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:38 its
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:40 its just experimental
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:47 its not meant for military or any of that
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:18:57 oh wait WHAT

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:20:39 swept forward wing has a lot of problems
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:20:42 like stability
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:20:48 no matter it removes a lot of drag and gives more speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:20:52 it has more cons than pros
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:20:55 why would the russians
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:21:01 fucking do it into a military plane

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:22:04 the su-47 looks like its not experimental and was truly used for military yknow
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 02:22:20 so why would you think about su-47 when su-47 is not experimental

general 2021-01-03 16:57:13 jesus isnt ballin
general 2021-01-03 16:57:34 true true
general 2021-01-03 16:57:41 wait
general 2021-01-03 16:57:43 they always scream sus
general 2021-01-03 16:57:45 they learned the word sus
general 2021-01-03 16:57:48 and repeat it all the time
general 2021-01-03 16:57:49 THEY PARROT
general 2021-01-03 16:57:59 they have 2 leg
general 2021-01-03 16:58:01 and wing hidden
general 2021-01-03 16:58:13 those are legs
general 2021-01-03 16:58:20 the leg just goes up
general 2021-01-03 16:58:24 and arm is like levitating over the leg
general 2021-01-03 16:58:30 so it looks like it was separate
general 2021-01-03 16:58:40 but theyre both the same limb
general 2021-01-03 16:58:49 parrots have legarms
general 2021-01-03 16:59:08 the human body has 5 legs
general 2021-01-03 16:59:12 1 is called left leg
general 2021-01-03 16:59:15 the other is called right leg
general 2021-01-03 16:59:18 the 3rd is called right arm
general 2021-01-03 16:59:21 the other is called left arm
general 2021-01-03 16:59:24 and the 5th is called head
general 2021-01-03 16:59:29 theyre all legs
general 2021-01-03 16:59:33 science lied to us
general 2021-01-03 16:59:46 we got 999 bones
general 2021-01-03 16:59:54 except people who dont drink milk
general 2021-01-03 16:59:56 they have -1 bones
general 2021-01-03 17:00:25 guys
general 2021-01-03 17:00:26 fact
general 2021-01-03 17:00:29 when u start growing
general 2021-01-03 17:00:31 bones start mixing
general 2021-01-03 17:00:37 so bones  become 1 bone after long tiem!
general 2021-01-03 17:00:50 very old old old old people (queen elizabeth for example) have 1 bone!
general 2021-01-03 17:00:54 and its called Skeleton
general 2021-01-03 17:01:11 im being serious
general 2021-01-03 17:01:15 adults have less bones than babies
general 2021-01-03 17:01:21 bones start infusing
general 2021-01-03 17:01:27 after long long time
general 2021-01-03 17:01:35 so if we give a human 10000000 years (like queen elizabeth)
general 2021-01-03 17:01:37 they reach to 1 bone+
general 2021-01-03 17:01:42 and that only bone they have is called skeleton!
general 2021-01-03 17:02:02 no?
general 2021-01-03 17:02:08 if your 70 years old, not
general 2021-01-03 17:02:18 if your 1000000 years old (like queen elizabeth) yes

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 16:54:39 it was the first and last of its kind
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 16:54:47 when taking off it had a failure and crashed, the pilot managed to bail out
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 16:56:17 bruh i failed landing but its takeoff and flight footage i havent showed that

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:36:42 they destroy servers
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:37:00 mf you would need a 600 block plot
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:37:10 if i had a 600 block plot i would make IJN zipang or HMS habakkuk
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:37:40 your mom covers entire US
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:37:53 sister HMS habakkuk and IJN zipang never existed
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:02 they were planned 600 meter gigantical warships
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:16 HMS habakkuk was a aircraft carrier made out of pykrete (ice mixed with wood) because ice could stop bullets
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:22 so it would have been extremely effective
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:34 tough the engines melted ice, they even tried to-
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:38 you idiot zipang neither existed

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:53 it had tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of main guns
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:38:58 IJN zipang
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:39:01 thats the name of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:39:05 IJN means imperial japanese navy
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:39:20 no
