plane-crazy 2020-05-05 08:14:55 I need to turn this thing into a bt 42 hull
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 08:15:19 and modify it so it can drive withnout tracks
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 08:15:48 meh I guess the traditional moving withnout tracks on bt tanks is kida hard to do

creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:28:02 I have no other colours
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:28:09 to match the french standard
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:28:26 nah it blinds myself
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:28:33 Imma go see a better blue
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:30:06 wich blue is better
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:30:22 for my tonk
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:30:34 because France made blue tonks
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:30:47 time to make it gray
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:31:41 > why even make it blue
france made blue tanks so
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:32:06 does it look better?
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:32:16 k then
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:35:48 I honestly can't do that
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:37:27 I tried a different type of suspension that would look like the one on the irl tank but realized I couldn't fit them in there
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:38:21 I'm trying to find a better colour rn
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:39:30 I guess this works
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:41:26 time to add a mostly cosmetic only wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:41:28 or maybe 2
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:42:36 it's brown
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:44:04 eh?
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:44:33 I tried making it more blueish
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:45:14 aren't them like
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:45:19 blue
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:45:39 I'm colourblind confirmed
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:46:00 I mean If I would've made it bigger I would've made it more detalied
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:46:10 but for this size
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:47:11 damn I have to extend the bacc to put another wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:49:55 do the wheels look better?
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:51:31 it looks cool
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:51:32 so yes
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:52:39 > Honestly, add on at least 500 blocks worth of detail.
also, the tank has already almost 500 blocks, how would you make it on a more of regular size but double the blocks?
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:53:19 now that
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:53:20 is hard
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:53:34 also kida big
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:54:20 can someone who is more experienced in building than me do a fcm 36?
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:54:50 I might redo mine tmr
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:54:54 make it bigger maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:56:25 yeah I'll redo it sometime
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:57:15 it will end up like everything else, forgotten
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:58:16 like my london monitor legs
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:58:40 wdym
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:58:57 a cylinder
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:59:06 that is the body
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:59:11 no it has an upper part
creations-chat 2020-08-24 19:59:17 that I've not made
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:03:38 since when train wheels exist?
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:04:32 only now i see they exist
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:05:05 as any normal person it's time to try make a train on 2 rails with those
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:14:32 this is just beautifull
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:15:08 you can actually make the gustav in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:15:31 it works so well on turning
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:17:29 am i the only one to say that those wheels look like the wheels on the german tank tiger 1?
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:05 i made my first jet and everyone seems to not like it
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:06 yeet
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:25 like just look at this thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:44 the flying sausauge
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:24:58 or the modified f104 starfighter
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:21:24 just comparing my first Churchill tank build and the probably last version of it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:21:55 the only thing that didn't change much is the hull
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:22:03 ?
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:22:18 well
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:22:35 look how stretched the first turret is
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:23:05 not as accurate tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:23:31 you see i wanted this tank to be accurate
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:24:11 I'd like to know what it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 22:24:33 you never know
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:33:23 remove the tracks and you have an oversized leopard 2 turret
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:33:44 also anyone here ever made an armoured train i wanna make one and i need inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:34:53 ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:35:17 make removable tracks
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:35:38 if its not 100% historical accurate it's not good
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:36:39 the t95 had 2 layers of tracks
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:36:43 treads
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:36:47 whatever you call them
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:37:00 and the exterior ones could be removed
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:37:59 understable
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:38:33 it's the time to turn my Churchill 7 into an armoured train
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:39:24 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:39:33 that will be the red line armoured train
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 12:40:33 i haven't played in a while and i saw there are new train wheels
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:42:52 made a metro 2033 style churchill 7 with a bmp gun, a big plow and a modified back to accept wagons
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:44:06 dreams
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:44:45 yeah man ik it's just, let's say it's german captured
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:45:16 it mostly looks like a 7
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:45:23 the base
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:45:25 of it
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:45:49 eh
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:45:56 it's the only tank that looks ok that i made
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:46:37 i also made a tiger 1 p
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:46:44 it looked ugly as hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:48:56 mine had
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:48:58 rectengular
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:48:59 turret
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:49:24 i deleted it a long ago
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:49:49 i want to make an american T34
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:49:55 next
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 14:31:00 anyone here can give me an idea how to make a really long train?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 14:33:32 like I'd like to make the rest of this, with wagons of about the same size as this but there's no way to fit it in the building area
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:25:04 cause i have no idea how to do that
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:25:35 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:25:37 it looks
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:25:40 beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:26:31 that looks amazing
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:44:21 what would be  a good color to fit russian tanks?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:53:03 i realised i can't draw stars
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:35:10 modified my metro 2033 churchill 3 to fit the red line armoured train theme
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:35:51 basically a railroad churchill battling ram
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:40:03 looks cool
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:42:16 metro 2033
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:44:29 it's an unholy abomination of aurora train and a churchill 3
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:50:24 well it's my churchill 3 tank and some modification of the aurora plow
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:53:13 i mean this is my model, but my man no need for toxicity not everyone is good at building stuff, i've done my best on that
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:55:14 thank you, make a better one then
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:57:18 look here, if you don't like how it looks, go fucking build one yourself k mate?
creations-chat 2021-02-20 20:59:49 yes it is, also, this might look better
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:03:57 if you haven't notice one is completely on a different design than the other
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:08:44 it's custom lol
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:13:28 also mate do it, make a churchill 3, rules are simple, don't play for a year then come back with the sudden idea of making something custom based on a thing you already have completely from your head, you can start from now
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:16:44 says the toxic 

<@!444476246899032086> says the depressive man pfp
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:20:48 hey <@!389756407483990028> take a look at this, dosen't this too look like a pile of green shit?

creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:24:51 you know the best quote that man said: To bombs we answer with bombs
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:29:17 <@!444476246899032086> here
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:29:52 it's still from the same faction as the tank should be
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:30:19 ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:30:42 i've combined quite too many
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:30:53 yea
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:31:41 well you see, elios, i do belive those people put effort and practice those stuff, i made that in about half a hour with very little planing
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:32:37 well you see, nothing looks good from the first try
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:32:56 also from the <#504436696021204992> i understand that
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:33:10 eh just to have it somewhere to compare my next upgrades
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:34:09 well i'll probably not gonna post stuff anymore because of the quality stuff but i'll keep that in mind
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:59:00 can just yea stop please it's over just don't
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:02:47 does anyone here have a Churchill 3 tank and can explain what is motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:03:43 copy
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:03:45 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:03:54 totally don't want to get inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:03:57 nono
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:04:00 straight up copy
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:04:09 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:04:20 why
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:04:26 I've got this community
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:04:39 i can ask actual good people to help me
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:05:32 you have this guy canadian in <#384025409945337856> go be toxic to him
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:05:43 anyone is good
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:06:04 it's not even supposed to be but ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:06:26 because no one uses actual tracks in metro 2033
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:07:11 both
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:08:55 that is like mostly for the star but also for the battling ram idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:09:53 ok what is motorlock like everyone talks about it
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:10:42 Well i haven't played in a year
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:11:13 if its not that hard can you tell me what is it
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:12:17 Well i anyway probably gonna quit again soon so it's no point in learning it
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 09:06:48 upgraded my churchill 3 compared to the old one what do you say?

plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:57:38 nah it's fine with that
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:58:01 i got a new idea hold on
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 17:58:47 make it a mobile bunker with 360 defense
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:52:50 I'm an engineer so that means I solve problems, so if you are ever to ask me what to do in a war I'd say use more guns
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:53:07 ik
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:53:17 spent 1-2 minutes mounting the hull gun lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:53:34 yeah um it's
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:53:45 i dunno it's somthing
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:54:10 oh I have an idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:55:41 ignore the hull gun how's the gap looking now?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 18:58:48 if more guns aren't enough, use even more
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:00:28 i had no idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:00:30 how to make it
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:00:34 so i left it like that
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:03:42 fourth gun ig?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:03:55 i'm running out of fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:04:12 dunno
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:04:20 never actually used them in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:04:44 now question is where to fit more guns
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:07:26 there we go
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:10:10 load all guns before then when enemy appears shoot it
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:21:09 ok notes: make 2 guns in front and another 2 on each side of it
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:21:32 now i'm really curious how will i manage to make that
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 10:17:22 e has anyone made a steam locomotive?
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 10:17:36 that
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 10:17:37 mirror
