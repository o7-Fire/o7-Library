plane-crazy 2019-11-19 00:18:44 Life is full of mistakes, and none of them are being fixed.. for even if we try, the rulers of the world wont allow it.

bot-central 2019-11-19 00:22:30 Uhhh
general 2020-01-20 06:39:11 Why don't they add an On/Off mode for the motors in the game?
general 2020-01-20 06:40:49 no.. i mean like how engines work
general 2020-01-20 06:41:27 You are able to toggle On/Off for a propeller engine, as wanting to turn on and off when you want it to but not for motors
general 2020-01-20 06:41:58 Im really in a need to be able to toggle unpowered motors
general 2020-01-20 06:42:18 so they can rotate freely then i can choose to start rotating them when i want to
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:44:31 Why don't they add an On/Off mode for the motors in the game?
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:45:53 That would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:46:33 Ik, at the moment im trying to make a gyroscope using an inf stabilizer as its center
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:47:09 But while im flying my plane i need the gyro to be able to rotate on its own and while still being able to rotate its motors when i need it to
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:48:34 Basically i need a motor that i can keep un powered then be able to power it again without returning to my base to change it with the purple tool..
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:49:24 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:49:58 Thats fine..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:48:11 The devs need to make a gamemode that allow us to actually feel the challenge part in Plane Crazy..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:48:30 Like to Great Goals for us to travel across terrained areas for points
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:49:05 Points could be earned by the weight of the object you choose to trasport
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:49:34 The more coins you have = the more you can spend on usful features on your creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:49:43 Like upgrading your starter blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:49:53 Or unlocking different / stronger materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:50:15 Like i mean.. the game already has a list of weakest to strongest engines
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:50:32 Why not implament it into a single block?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:50:55 So you have to buy in points that you earn to upgrade the blocks..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:52:05 Starter creations would start off with rusted weaker parts..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:52:43 Like faulty control panels, small rusted propaller engines, weak motors..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:54:41 It would be interesting to see Plane Crazy be the first building game to have both "Creative" and "Survival challenge mode"
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 10:55:25 It would beome the best building game on roblox if these were implimented
