creations-chat 2021-04-21 05:36:32 i would crash as it requires the wall to move back, the turret to move up in an elevator,  and get pushed into where the wall was. motorlocking the turret would cause a nightmare. (im gonna have 6 of these cannons)

help 2021-04-22 04:23:06 idea is that turret can "deploy"
help 2021-04-22 04:23:47 also when the turret is gone a wall will pop up from underneath
help 2021-04-22 04:24:12 and when i want to deploy i can just move the wall down, and push the turret back out

help 2021-04-23 00:17:10 never
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:23:19 My game occasionally freezes / crashes without me being able to move my mouse at all (i have to alt f4 to get out). This seems to happen when I explode in any way (rockets and tnt are all I've had it with so far) and it started to happen around a week ago. My pc is more than capable handling heavy lag so it isn't my pc (rtx 2060 with 9th gen i7 and 100mps internet). I have even crashed / froze from one, normal (not motorlocked or anything like that) rocket. The builds that it crash on are not prone to lag either so this is for sure a game issue. The error message either takes absolutely ages to come up or it never does. My game just stops. I'm an idiot and never took an f9 but I will if I remember and if it lets me (screen frozen).
help 2021-04-23 00:28:36 this has been happening over multiple days

creations-chat 2021-07-12 01:39:14 ok now calm down lol
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:15:34 Don‚Äôt copy. Experiment. Step 1: imagine your project. Step 2: build small sections of it one at a time. When you are building these parts, you can easily evaluate any design flaws. Step 3: once your project is together, ask for feedback and get bullied by everyone enough to fix all the issues they found. Step 4: make new build and repeat. | <@!837769118237065226> it‚Äôs so much more fun to do it that way than to copy some tutorial and learn nothing
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:18:04 <@!837769118237065226> and if I can‚Äôt convince you to not use tutorials (you learn nothing from then and it‚Äôs so so so much less fun to use them) then for the love of god DO NOT CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN

general 2021-08-20 21:51:48 is what i do
general 2021-08-20 22:14:22 its like they are braindead
general 2021-08-20 22:14:30 they just attack anything
general 2021-08-20 22:14:34 even when you are in build mode
general 2021-08-20 22:14:48 lmfao
general 2021-08-20 22:17:58 this is my point, the issue with shredders is that there is no effort and creativity in the building AND the combat / use. this just makes players get braindead and attracts braindead people causing the cycle to get worse. at the end of it you end up with people swarming you even when you arent spawned in.
general 2021-08-20 22:18:55 the issue with his argument is that he is ruining other peoples fun

general 2021-08-24 10:46:47 "uncanny valley"
general 2021-08-24 16:31:06 they have no brains it is astonishing
general 2021-08-24 16:31:28 every single one constantly swarms me even when im in build mode
general 2021-08-24 16:32:04 then they act like they are being creative
general 2021-08-24 16:32:41 no creativity in the combat and the building. literally less fun but since they are so stupid they never listen or realise
general 2021-08-24 16:32:45 all of them say that

general 2021-08-26 20:15:26 i beg
general 2021-08-27 09:54:16 its sad because you will have a great game but with a chernobyl toxic community
general 2021-08-27 09:54:33 like i dont wanna spend my day in an argument with some guy online
general 2021-08-27 09:56:05 like
general 2021-08-27 09:56:08 do you know galaxy?
general 2021-08-27 09:56:15 absolutley amazing game
general 2021-08-27 09:56:18 one of the best
general 2021-08-27 09:56:27 but the community is utter cancer
general 2021-08-27 09:57:02 there's been like 4 revolutions lmao
general 2021-08-27 09:59:39 i just dont get how stuff gets that bad
general 2021-08-27 09:59:40 like
general 2021-08-27 09:59:46 its more fun not being toxic
general 2021-08-27 09:59:50 but some brainlets are
general 2021-08-27 09:59:58 then it just spirals
general 2021-08-27 10:01:10 galaxy community is like 3 megaton nuke
general 2021-08-27 10:01:15 not castle bravo
general 2021-08-27 10:01:17 but
general 2021-08-27 10:01:20 still awful
general 2021-08-27 10:01:28 no
general 2021-08-27 10:01:28 well
general 2021-08-27 10:01:40 i change my mind its castle bravo
general 2021-08-27 10:01:54 like how do you even have 4 revolutions
general 2021-08-27 10:02:25 the game is great but a game isnt a game without players so if the playerbase is cancer than that transfers over to the game
general 2021-08-27 10:02:55 if you ignore the toxicity (which you cant) then it would be one of the best games ever
general 2021-08-27 10:03:17 don't mine at war
general 2021-08-27 10:03:20 thats lik
general 2021-08-27 10:03:21 e
general 2021-08-27 10:03:39 i agree with you man
general 2021-08-27 10:03:48 if you grind a little bit you can get a good miner
general 2021-08-27 10:03:56 then you are set
general 2021-08-27 10:04:03 no more bad grinding unless you want super cap
general 2021-08-27 10:04:06 but no point in that
general 2021-08-27 10:04:15 but
general 2021-08-27 10:04:20 the devs are dumb as hell
general 2021-08-27 10:04:26 its not bad thought
general 2021-08-27 10:04:29 though
general 2021-08-27 10:04:34 have you seen the cancer arcade is
general 2021-08-27 10:04:44 its just ship nuking all around

general 2021-08-27 10:05:46 because if you didnt it would be ship nuking 24/7
general 2021-08-27 10:06:02 and it makes the battles more interesting
general 2021-08-27 10:06:18 they would not work if you enemy could just keep spamming dreads
general 2021-08-27 10:06:24 you have to be tactical
general 2021-08-27 10:06:42 i agree
general 2021-08-27 10:06:55 i think galaxy is for some people and others dont like it and thats fine
general 2021-08-27 10:07:11 i respect your opinion though

the-dump 2021-09-25 23:00:52 HESH shells have an advantage over regular kinetic energy rounds as their effectiveness does not decrease with distance. This shell works by creating a shockwave on detonation. Once this wave reaches a void, it reflects back. The point at which the waves cross causes tension feedback which rips apart the plate, carrying a scab with approximately half the kinetic energy forwards, scattering shrapnel around the interior of the target. Test firing of the L4 against a Conqueror and a Centurion proved how powerful the round was. In two shots, the 183 mm HESH shell blew the turret clean off the Centurion, and split the mantlet of the Conqueror in half. HESH could also serve as a dual-use round just as capable of engaging enemy armor as for use as a high-explosive round against buildings, enemy defensive positions, or soft-skinned targets.
