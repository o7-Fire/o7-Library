creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:24:23 The context isn't so easy is it
creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:33:02 I would agree. I get the strict judgement on anything of course but the the concern is the fact that anything that uses "motor 2" parts and has a exotic design is automatically hate because of the similarities to a "shredder bug". The real problem here is the fact that I did not do a clip on the build an that hides the potential. I am not disappointed but next time I will do clips if I can. The build I posted does not have shredders and the maneuverability is on point compared to the annoying bugs even when idle in air. The maneuverability is also more delayed than a shredder bug and so that is the clearance.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:39:19 I would say that at this point there are so many shredder bugs that I can't build anything related to sci fi that is like that if someone is gonna jump to conclusions
creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:45:30 Hey guys my finger is a shredder bug
creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:52:28 Should I cut the International Space Station off because it is a shredder bug too?
