plane-crazy 2020-12-17 18:11:21 same
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 18:11:32 oh
creations-chat 2020-12-17 20:22:34 Yeah lol
But the only thing i can do is leave the terrain out of frame
creations-chat 2020-12-17 20:29:07 Tbh, i was planning to make the island like that, but i would not have enought space to build certain things.
Also the folding mechanism would get kinda complicated.
creations-chat 2020-12-17 20:31:34 I *think* is not possible.

creations-chat 2021-06-09 15:58:31 About the tilt, it's impossible to avoid it due to the way the sails work. Also, i *think* it looks neat.
