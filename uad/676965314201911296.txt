help 2023-04-25 08:31:39 Damn
help 2023-04-25 08:31:50 im still level 0
creations-chat 2023-04-25 08:34:12 Ok, are you sure you dont mean 72 days? Since 72 hours doesnt sound like that much when you have 3 different ships that look like that
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 08:37:39 That is the most jet ever i have ever seen
creations-chat 2023-04-25 08:38:20 72 Days, I get place crazy is addicting but holy thats a lot of playtime.

creations-chat 2023-04-25 08:41:21 Do you only have that as a reference image or is there like a 3d model you have so you can properly make the ship.
general 2023-04-25 08:43:33 What game is that
creations-chat 2023-04-25 08:46:07 Is that hard just having limited 2d images, or is it not bad since you have lots of playtime and experience.
Because I know I would never be able to make something just from 2d images
