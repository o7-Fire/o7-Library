creations-chat 2020-11-06 01:25:10 <@!720751430595772418>  if i had used triangle wedges and triangle wedge blocks it wouldn't fit, and it would look weird, jut so you know im going to change it when the rest of the build is done, but thank you for the opinions
<@!347918144062488586> i'm doing that so i can make the plane go on land, basically going to fold the build

general 2020-11-09 21:00:24 just asking btw
creations-chat 2020-11-10 00:43:04 making a pbj-1j staring with the blueprint part then i'm doing the sides later, just gotta finish this part first
creations-chat 2020-11-10 01:15:24 i downvoted his creation bc its not an actual creation
creations-chat 2020-11-10 01:16:55 its a meme build tho and he didn't post an actual creation in plane crazy, he only grabbed a tank image and uploaded it to the creations tab, i feel like he should be warned for posting a non plane crazy build
creations-chat 2020-11-10 01:19:32 its too tall
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:00:22 ok almost done just gotta do the tail wing part i'm pretty sure then fix a few gaps then i can do the sides
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:10:29 i basically start with the shape of the whole build using a blueprint
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:12:03 well i'd probably add a few more details and the end of those wings are a little strange

i also might make my pbj-1j a passenger plane not sure tho
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:14:37 those wing tips at each end make it a little strange, and i think it should have just a few more detail, i know those rockets make him turn but it just makes the plane worse, atleast hide it somewhere, i dislike a few features of the plane, also made a better paintjob? just an opinion though
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:16:31 also the cockpit is way too big ngl <:FixPls:548709302282747914> pls
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:18:41 anyway hows my pbj-1j that i'm currently making?

blueprint:

creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:40:59 yeah and add a filter to it

<@!489910972946055172> oh ok
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:42:46 no it actually is, the higher the graphics the better resolution, the less the graphics the less resolution
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:36:43 can people stop building mini among characters in plane crazy its actually dumb i've seen like over 100 builds of among us players in plane crazy when among us got popular
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:38:53 i like among us but its so stupid that almost every server i see i see among us characters
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:43:30 lol i thought it was just a really short & ugly f35 but now i think its a fine build judging by the real plane's apperance

i'm sure he can doa half wedge down/half wedge up 1x2 then place a block after it then do a half wedge 1x2 or if you can do a wedge 1x2 at the end of that

i would also reccomend motorlock into the build for it to look much better looking
(basically the wings)
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:47:09 looks a little wide
bug-reports 2020-11-11 22:29:20 yeah they are broken, never happened to me though
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:25:09 working on ze tail
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:28:54 thank
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:34:31 <@!771021106563645452> whats with the 2 wings on each side? it makes it worse just make the lower part of the wings motorlocked into the top wings and it'll be better
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:36:35 "yoooo ur build is so low effort ewwww"

was a joke
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:38:06 holy shit that is a lot of pics for one small build
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:09:02 jeez
(not mine btw)
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:57:22 its not done?
i wanted to make a motorlock creation and its fun for me to do motorlock, plus it would look better, it'll be done in the future, i understand it looks weird for now but it'll be much better
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:59:21 lol
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:01:35 yooo is that the real travis scott batman?
also if you downvote a build doesn't mean you gotta say half of its bad or something to reduce toxicity
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:03:42 yeah the smaller the build the harder it is because you don't have as much space to put into it, larger builds however have much bigger space
general 2020-11-13 01:46:16 e
general 2020-11-13 01:46:30 h e l l o
general 2020-11-13 01:46:49 yoo
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:37:23 how come that thing is huge compared to a b-25 mitchell
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:40:30 ok so this is a b18 that thing is huge compared to my plane
basically tell me what is identical
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:42:33 its a legendary car and it is good
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:44:04 ok tail wings are done just gotta finish the tail and then i'm doing wings, then later add detail and make it more stable then paintjob then i'm done with the whole build
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:45:45 let me guess the top is a girl version the bottom photo is the normal camo, right?
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:47:28 <@!201154203387691018> i downvoted because i feel like more could've been done out of it, and maybe a few extra detail in the inside and maybe a parking lot, thats why i downvoted
and yes slav its realistic but add more detail like the parking lot and stuff
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:48:59 dope
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:50:47 the amount of motorlock on this is too much for a little plane
plus it glitches out so i might have to fix things
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:53:25 dark mode is better tho its much easier to see
(just a opinion don't hate me pls)
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:55:04 old boat of cofe, cofe is ded tho so u can make that whatever company you want now
lol remember kyle's massive fully red ship for cofe so plain and that cockpit looked like a boeing 747, still good tho
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:57:49 oh god not this cringe piece of crap
(the old global airways wide plane with the diner at the back that i messed up making me have to rebuild it)

creations-chat 2020-11-15 01:31:49 *not
creations-chat 2020-11-15 01:36:42 its e

creations-chat 2020-11-15 01:40:37 what about now
creations-chat 2020-11-15 01:47:51 o nice
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:06:38 the gun is too long at the end of the nose
whatever it is
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:08:24 yeah ok but still its too long
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:09:55 yeah i started 2 weeks ago
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:12:44 well u should check ur feckin' shiba incorporated general and see what i said
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:14:15 lol heavy planes need that to get lift (unless they spam a whole fucking lot of control surfaces)
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:15:58 well they atleast need a way to get lift
(plus i'm talking about like 3 folded ships. airliners, cargo planes, etc)
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:17:30 well i mean yeah that deffinetly would fly but huge airliners they need like super thrusters to be able to take off or something like that, i always see people doing that
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:19:42 <@456226577798135808> how many blocks is that plane?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:23:30 wtf how that thing isnt even folded
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:25:07 lemme see build mode
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:26:38 oh i thought the plot would be filled with motor lock lol
creations-chat 2020-11-15 15:59:52 the cockpit is also weird because those delta wings that are meatnt for detail at thee cockpit and showing from outside the build, it makes it look worse
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:01:56 
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:20:25 yeah but maybe fix those ladders in the intake
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:22:42 like remove the ladders, also the intake is a little tall
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:24:33 yes

creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:57:16 i hope the colors are good
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:00:54 no its actually pretty useful, and no, there isn't tutorials its just like colors and sounds. you can also post them to the public in the server if you wish
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:10:54 <@!322970944303923200> whats wrong with the colors?
and no, im not mad i'm just asking
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:12:37 well ik but it can be helpful for some people atleast, but thx for the opinion! i totally respect your opinion, and i will make a change to that!
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:48:54 yeah just make a motor lock tower and connect that tail wing to the tower and ur good
also send a photo if it works
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:50:32 i watched a tutorial about motorlock and it was easy
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:06:21 <:what:644996672048463942> 
wip of blenheim palace (1/2 of the building i'm doing, someone else will do other half)
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:08:10 yeah im sure thats why you blocked him
creations-chat 2020-11-16 23:54:48 heres the things you can fix
the logo on the sides is pretty weird for the plane and i feel like it would make the build worse, so basically delete it (no offense to the build btw)

the tail could use some work, and also the tail wing could be less blocky, use motorlock to make it better looking, also that curve from the nose is a little bit weird, but so far i think its a good start. i don't hate the build, i just say that you should fix this

creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:04:04 show the image of the irl plane
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:05:36 this doesn't look as blocky, plus the tail wing on yours is longer and smaller than what it should be, especially the nose having a wedge at the ends of the nose

creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:18:15 ok guys welcome back to another tutorial today i will be showing you how to do a 360 noscope in a a-10 warthog so first you gotta have a motor and a anchor below it, next you anchor in the sky and do a 360, next you shoot then boom, also sights must be on it, such as a black block scope

(is joke btw)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:19:56 lol moment
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:22:01 what if in plane crazy you tried attempting to make the biggest plane in plane crazy history so you make a antonov an-500 and you get 10 people to join the idea and ur done, next u combine it like lego and try to fly it, it flies, now you want to turn it into a ** lag bomber**

lag moment
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:23:35 plan b: spam **helium** and **rocket engines** on the outside of the plane and inside the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:25:11 <@!719168864705052802> well i was doing that as a joke, plus i'm sure it would break, and yes roblox physics are garbage

creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:54:53 its alright i understand, but the build is really nice, keep up the good work!
<@!608413463353622577> he probably wanted to do it in <#384025409945337856>  because he would probably think it'd be easier to get opinions plus more people go on creations (idk if thats true) than <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:58:18 oh ok

creations-chat 2020-11-20 23:51:52 you can still see the image just click on it lol
creations-chat 2020-11-20 23:59:22 you can see it on dark mode jsut click on the GIF
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:40:19 <@!696095829345173605> its too curvy
creations-chat 2020-11-22 14:48:47 <@!765663677604429825> why self upvote?
creations-chat 2020-11-22 14:50:31 but that just makes everyone hate you for selfupvoting, plus self upvoting is kinda  rule now
creations-chat 2020-11-22 14:54:10 ok yeah pretty much i use filters just to make the quality better, if i have buildings like the world trade center or the saturn v rocket i put a filter there jsut for the vibe & era at the time
creations-chat 2020-11-22 14:56:35 well no like lets say, 1960-1970s, thats when i put the old looking filter there, plus no not like the early 2000s, there would only jsut have to be a crop to the photo
<@456226577798135808> yeah i had the world trade center and that weird jet
creations-chat 2020-11-22 14:58:09 nice
creations-chat 2020-11-22 15:00:53 see, i use the filter because of the era of that time with cameras, and to make it better quality, this filter here would be a 1960s-1970s filter
creations-chat 2020-11-22 15:02:26 <@456226577798135808> i already did lol, but thing is i don't know if i would be aloud to post it bc the rocket is pretty much finished but the tower isn't, and you cannot upload wip builds in creations
creations-chat 2020-11-22 15:03:57 ok cool, anyway yeah so since i'm making a huge blenheim palace should i just crop and filter it, or just only crop it for photos

bug-reports 2020-11-22 21:39:41 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:52:46 opinions?
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:53:07 and yeah this is based off a lancer, the nose being a little bit inspired by a sr-71
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:53:17 the back isn't done yet
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:53:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:53:50 i will fix some stuff in the meantime
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:54:29 closeup
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:54:34 also yes i will color it
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:45:36 yes, and too long
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:49:19 probably use better colors, like the ones on the image
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:52:42 nono, like just copy the colors from the image, did we ever say to make a new one?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:55:01 well, you can just use a autoclicker and delete like, 15-25 blocks then put the nose there, jsut basically copy the original nose and ur good
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:00:07 i would basically get a image like this, then do the red outline with wedges to get the shape, then get another blueprint for the front and back and do those, then i would be able to get more blueprints and do the rounded parts, the wings/control surfaces being the last part
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:27:16 juan.
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:28:49 juan-jet.
yeah wip so is bad
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:30:19 its a custom jet, but its based off a lancer, f-117, and a sr71 lol
do you mean the f-117 jet?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:31:49 wings vented? sus
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:37:05 step 3: nou
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:41:07 step 7: play plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:47:51 step 12: undo the steps and restart again
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:49:26 step 1: die
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:50:56 you can try doing it but with a better plan <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:52:53 any ways on how i can add the landing gear onto this damn jet?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 22:58:23 nvm ik how now
creations-chat 2020-11-24 01:04:07 i couldn't get it to fly with other ways, plus the space between the upper portion of the plane and the bottom portion of the plane wouldn't fit
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:03:51 <@!711516970230612030> thats not an actual creation
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:05:37 thats not a creation
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:07:32 n o delete it, you have to have an actual creation like this, not something that shows how much is ur speed and just something at the sky
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:09:02 thank you, now i wasn't trying to be rude, but don't just post something what u just posted a minute ago
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:11:56 in larger scale, yes
creations-chat 2020-11-24 02:43:49 yeah... i dunno how
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:02:03 <@!661710255444590615> no wip builds
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:03:34 post on <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:06:47 opinions?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:08:28 yes
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:11:02 yeah i can see that, but that was to fit the sweep wing system, and actually the back isn't wide, although i'm gonna redo the back a little bit since it looks ugly, here it is.
the jet on the back looks horrifying compared to the front
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:13:16 nah idc i was jsut asking for opinions, because i got downvotes and nobody really responded and i wanted to know what the issue was with the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:15:19 especially with the whole build being even, the nose is 2 blocks wide (the cockpit) so that kinda made it maybe uglier, plus it was compact so thats why it looks kinda weird
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:16:56 oh holy crap i'm sorry i didn't know it was too dark for you lol yeah the colors that i did looked ugly so i sticked with black and it looks fine to me, it also looked more like a nighthawk which was the main part of the jet.
plus i knew i was gonna say it looked ugly sicne this is actually my first time making a compact and good looking even build, thanks for the opinion though!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:19:07 yeah use half blocks to cover them, put it on the top of the tower or whatever type of motor lock system ur using, although for some parts of motor lock like the one on the image, there is exposed motor lock on the nose but i couldn't be able to hide it
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:20:37 its only 5 motors being shown, and it would take long for you to re-work it with half blocks to cover the build, so i think its fine
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:22:09 lol but that would be difficult since if you have no thruster to make you turn, it would be really hard for you to turn ur plane
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:23:53 yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:25:44 <@!355917095827013632> i can also help with motor lock builds if you'd like, i'm pretty good at them so if you need help with motor locked builds, i can help you out with them
creations-chat 2020-11-24 05:51:51 <@!623859281946476554> stop lol
creations-chat 2020-11-24 08:23:02 <@!774377045346091008> not to be rude, but the tank looks pretty weird
creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:15:42 well i just got it to 100 upvotes (the bot not included)
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:54:47 <@!469590708685373445> it looks a little weird
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:56:18 the colors are kinda weird, and space stations are usually way bigger, most of them only use grey & blue, not with yellow
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:57:50 thats what space stations usually look like
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:59:28 what i can say about ur space station is that it just looks weird
creations-chat 2020-11-24 21:05:43 dude just accept it, everyone gets downvotes, so chill about it, i didn't say you were a bad builder, i only said that the build was weird, thats all
creations-chat 2020-11-24 22:14:20 <@!658829907110920192> you can't post wip builds in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 22:17:07 <@!658829907110920192>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 22:19:43 its way too short & weird looking, use folds to make it longer, also not being rude, i'm just telling what bugs me
creations-chat 2020-11-24 22:21:14 <@!414359638302130176> damn you still have creations blacklist?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 22:22:52 oh

creations-chat 2020-11-24 23:36:30 the nose seems too short, what is the name of the jet?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 23:38:40 for me personally, the nose looks too short in my opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-25 00:51:05 don't keep pinging him
just dm him
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:49:11 <@!715036601247465599> Whats wrong with thephoto? Just asking, I'm not mad, I jsut wanted your thoughts & opinions.
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:50:44 Oh sorry, I can post the actual build, sorry! Thank you for letting me know. :)
and no, I jsut used windows files photoshop, I usually just crop and filter the image to make it better.
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:52:42 Yeah, I kinda wanna do styles like the Soviet guy does with the explosions and stuff, I already asked a few mins ago though.
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:54:13 Oh yeah, you're the guy with the Titanic, I forgot lol.
<@456226577798135808> Whats wrong with the image? Just asking. 😄
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:57:50 Ok! Yeah I'm deffinetly changing bits of the plane, especially it being a custom plane, it looks kinda weird, plus it was ahrd since the build wasn't odd, it was even. Thanks for the opinions though! 😄
creations-chat 2020-11-25 04:59:50 <@!774377045346091008> Whats wrong with the plane? Just asking.
creations-chat 2020-11-25 05:01:40 Well no, He downoted both so i just wanted to question what was wrong with the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-25 05:06:22 Ok! Thank you for the opinion! I totally respect your opinion and I will make changes! 😄

creations-chat 2020-11-25 05:14:26 let him do what he wants to do, its his build, you can't just mass downvote his builds for not using wedges, its atleast more complicated looking and he took time to make that stuff
creations-chat 2020-11-25 05:18:59 <@456226577798135808> chill out, let him build what he does, don't jsut mass downvote his builds for not using wedges, he takes a lot of time to do those and it actually looks good.

creations-chat 2020-11-25 19:31:52 oh sorry i didn't know it was too tiny, i just wanted to make ti far so you could see the entire carrier, instead of jsut like part of the carrier removed from the photo which would make it extremely strange

creations-chat 2020-11-25 20:29:57 codes: 168, and 199. 168 would be the brown part while the rest would be 199 <@!506509000213528577>
creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:34:02 that thing looks hella weird

creations-chat 2020-11-26 07:23:19 since ur cockpit is awkardly shaped it looks a little weird, but its better
creations-chat 2020-11-26 07:29:58 both are bad ngl but yours is better
creations-chat 2020-11-26 07:50:59 you can fold the rest of the build
creations-chat 2020-11-26 07:53:02 ik but the plane would look way better if u folded it
creations-chat 2020-11-26 08:15:21 oh nice plane
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:10:56 <@!765020536182013993> why self upvote?
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:13:08 but that just makes everyone hate you.
Welcome to PCC
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:18:49 also the reason why people are downvoting creations is because they think ur build is bad looking
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:20:26 well thats ur opinion and plus u only think that bc ur new, plus i didnt say it was bad i said that the reason why they downvoted is because its bad

basically what im saying is that everyone has a different opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:21:57 lmao did he just spam emojis and ping me wtf
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:23:40 yeah and this server can get toxic at times, if someone sees a good build that has a lot of detail and looks cool looking they'll upvote, if they hate it and complain of the design of the build or a concern with the build they will downvote.
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:26:07 yeah.
also who and how do u know? <@!555601119473041409>.
also he joined in 2020 so yeah he could be a unde plus he friends a lot of people, now yeah i have a lot of people on my friends list, but i rarely accept random friend requests unless i hang out with them for like 15-30 minutes or i think they're cool
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:27:50 ohhh ok lol i was about to say wait what me? yeah we might wanna get a mod to check the situation
should i also make another custom jet
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:29:50 someone send me a image of a jet to create, althoguh yeah don't get a really hard looking jet just get one that i could probably motor lock or is simple
creations-chat 2020-11-27 01:31:21 yeah ok but only ur friend nobody else. lmao u also removed ur self upvote. plus ur mad that we downvoted ur build <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:38:44 <@!637820395961188355> you can't post wip builds in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:40:14 those wings looked like it was a wip, sorry lol i thought it was a wip mb
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:43:31 aaaaa.
anyway yeah make that logo have a better appearence like add a actual log not just "H"
(also yeah these are jsut opinions)
also yeah make a colour scheme like this so it looks pretty cool:
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:45:04 also yeah that b-29h has a very short wingspan and they look like this, not short wings and 1 engine
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:46:59 oh lol, but yeah add a second engine and a large wingspan and the colour scheme like the one on the image and you're good! the planes nice so far though also yeah the image u did there with the A, that letter should be in the back, not the front
or is it a wip?
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:48:29 and yeah i'd be happy to help with your plane if you'd like
creations-chat 2020-11-27 07:57:38 🙂

creations-chat 2020-11-27 21:56:48 yeah, not to be rude but it doesn't really look like the one that you posted, yours is more of like a humvee without a gun and only having 3 wheels (no offense though)
creations-chat 2020-11-27 21:58:41 ghost ping?
creations-chat 2020-11-27 22:00:27 yeah and then you can say like: sorry for the repost but i updated it and made it better or something idrk (i don't really know)
creations-chat 2020-11-27 22:02:26 use 1x2s on its side then a triangle wedge 1x2 for that corner thing in the front, use motorlock for the custom angles and use standard wedges for the windows and the sides
creations-chat 2020-11-27 22:09:30 don't ping <@!644377285746622494>

creations-chat 2020-11-27 23:27:34 alright, but heres the blueprint i did and looks pretty realistic to it but sure thing!
creations-chat 2020-11-27 23:50:39 <@!719168864705052802> since it's pretty hard i might stick to 1x4 wedges unless you wanan join me and help
creations-chat 2020-11-27 23:54:28 no, i tried getting a blueprint that was big because it was hard to see how big the shape would have to actually be and the size of the image
creations-chat 2020-11-27 23:56:21 actually thats pretty good thx, let me take a image of it and crop it so i can use that
creations-chat 2020-11-27 23:58:54 i wasn't gonna do a full scale build, i kinda wanted to go for a little smaller custom scale, plus if i made it longer it would've looked way uglier and not match to an actual b-29
creations-chat 2020-11-28 00:11:23 is this better? <@456226577798135808> i fixed the length, its 52 blocks long now
creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:26:35 how the hell is this guy getting many upvotes, plus he even upvoted his own creation

creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:05:19 <@!691268263459684472> Reason for the downvote? Just needing your opinions. 🙂
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:07:12 Answer the question, unless you just randomly downvoted for no reason. (lmao he deleted his message)
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:09:06 LMAO you downvoted my build because i downvoted your builds? I downvoted them because they looked bad. That means you just downvoted for no reason.
You're suppost to upvote or downvote builds to see how they look.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:10:41 I wasn't starting a fight, but thats a really dumb idea how you jsut downvoted my builds jsut because i downvoted your creation. its suppost to be how good the build is, not being people downvote your creations.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:12:35 Literally, its about how good the build looks. Not because people downvote your creations. Plus it's kinda a rule not to random downvote.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:15:46 Lmao this guy-
He downvoted my build because I downvoted his creation so he got mad.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:18:13 I'm gonna message him and apologize (i guess) since I made him leave.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:21:54 Ok i finished typing to him. I don't know what he'll say.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:25:00 Them wings are looking **weird**
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:46:31 nice
creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:52:15 yeah also add this part
creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:58:57 <@!658140951273013248> you can't post wip builds in <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2020-11-29 00:14:06 <@456226577798135808> add this onto ur nose
creations-chat 2020-11-29 00:30:03 the propellers are too small, same with the wings
creations-chat 2020-11-29 01:21:26 nice\
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:32:49 the colors are different (which i don't care) and the cockpit is way too low
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:34:56 making the arsenal bird, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:55:07 oh i see hes talking about making those yellow wedges look better by using motorlock for the curves on the other side
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:56:39 yeah thats what im talking about
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:03:50 lol for some reason that looks like the nsoe got replaced with a ac-130's nose
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:06:05 ac-8b harrier concept lmao
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:09:16 all featuring a totally not related ac-130 nose, a really beautiful (totally) tail wing with part of the back top taken off, really short wings, and bloody diarrhea on both sides of the nose (lmao the nose is so steep too)
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:11:26 lol it was joke, anyway the nose is nice in both, idrc on any both, but the first image gives it more color
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:23:56 <@!392031895657119754> you can't post tutorials in <#384025409945337856> lmao
you basically only added motorlock so it still counts as a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:27:57 <:pain:644301805534183464>
<@!392031895657119754> how do u not know u can post tutorials even though you have designer IV, terrain specialist III, and shipwright II
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:38:25 i saw him delete that lol
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:51:53 lol yeah plus he upvotes the current build that doesn't look as good as the others, weird right?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 03:53:40 ? edit that message lol that made no sense for some reason
general 2020-11-29 03:53:52 <@!641121449247113247> ?

creations-chat 2020-11-29 19:35:52 <@!614659754249420810>
creations-chat 2020-11-29 19:50:27 but that parachute is as big as a 3x3 so thats not as small as the other. i can make a even smaller one though 🙂

creations-chat 2020-11-29 20:08:14 
creations-chat 2020-11-29 23:47:45 that looks nothing like a ac-130 bc of the nose and yeah its a tutorial def
creations-chat 2020-11-29 23:54:32 how the hell is that ac-130 getting so many upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:37:08 the carrier looks bad thats why i downvoted <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-11-30 03:00:40 downvote what
creations-chat 2020-11-30 03:02:11 seems legit
<@!491570111787040778> oh yeah i'd downvote that bc it looks weird and the guns
creations-chat 2020-11-30 22:46:19 <@!758872381312729088> seriously bro
creations-chat 2020-12-01 01:15:17 yes, he only used motor lock
creations-chat 2020-12-01 01:41:06 <@456226577798135808> nice alien eyes you got there, pretty big
creations-chat 2020-12-01 01:43:54 lol i was talking about these. ik its your avatar but i was doing it as a joke lmao
creations-chat 2020-12-01 02:54:13 hows my hull so far for my custom submarine? and yeah it'll be a quad fold so massive submarine
creations-chat 2020-12-01 02:56:20 the size or type of ship? if yes then yes, it will be a submarine, and it will be a quad fold
<@!251880826386513924> yeah i might make the ship lower but i'm not sure, but it looks liek a right height for me
creations-chat 2020-12-01 02:58:11 yeah, might need someone to help me on the uh shape, since it looks super basic and i'm not that great of a ship builder, but yeah thx for the opinions
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:02:00 tutorial moment
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:06:05 nice
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:46:45 should i make the red part go up or the same? if up by 2 blocks or 4 blocks?
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:48:31 wdym sea level?
<@!251880826386513924> ight thx
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:50:20 better?
<@456226577798135808> this is a submarine so you really won't see this
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:51:59 that would be hard to do, let me test in water and see if it works or not. its a custom submarine and i felt like it should have more color
<@!251880826386513924> yeah i was also trying to make it ww2 style a bit
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:54:17 ik it looks pretty terrible and the red is deffietly showing up (all of the red) but once the hull and other stuff is done it will look good
creations-chat 2020-12-01 03:57:59 <@!545793563703640065> im making it a quad fold so it would be a perfect size, but thanks
creations-chat 2020-12-01 04:02:04 up to you, but i'd say a commerical plane
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:36:14 bruh no, i downvoted bc it doesn't look like a drone and it looks weird. i upvote and downvote builds. don't think i just always downvote builds bro

hyperbot is just the creations bot that upvotes & downvotes yoru creations so its easier to upvote & downvote rather than a million people just posting emojis on it
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:45:34 this part is tough, can anyone help? (the little hole thing at the front of the hull)
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:47:25 its a custom quad fold submarine i'm making, its a little inspired by the u boat (7) series submarines
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:50:06 <@!707255933201416304> yeah i was kinda doing that but that would be hard because of the amount of space i would have
<@!550694959011987457> lol thats not my chinook, i'm terrible at helicopters
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:51:49 oh yeahh i forgot i was gonna add a propeller system for it to fly..!
creations-chat 2020-12-01 21:06:15 oh nice lol, thats actually like the first good mini ro-scale delorean i've seen in a long time
creations-chat 2020-12-01 21:11:09 np
creations-chat 2020-12-01 21:14:00 oh nice
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:37:25 <@!516692337750179841> motorlock those guns inside the nose so that the plane looks better and looks like an actual plane. (thats the only reason why i downvoted, the rest is pretty good)
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:40:23 <@!516692337750179841>
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:41:56 yeah but motorlock them inside the nose not outside
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:43:30 <@!516692337750179841> thats the outside not inside the nose
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:45:30 you could make a motor lock tower and delete those guns at the nose and place them at that motor lock tower
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:47:01 lol yeah, its pretty annoying but somehow it reduces toxicity or something
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:49:45 nice
creations-chat 2020-12-02 00:15:19 hmm someone jsut selfupvoted their boat
creations-chat 2020-12-02 00:16:51 lmao yeah, oh he removed the self upvote

creations-chat 2020-12-05 05:20:04 looks pretty easy but that the same time looks kinda confusing

creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:07:41 ok he is not a unde, which i'm suprised
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:10:21 @voxelblocks, <@!660341617537843210> is mass downvoting
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:12:22 <:PogU:670373666164572172> he copied one of the planes in that one image
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:21:09 ok- well uh-
the fuselage looks weird especially the nose, but the wings look pog so far. post wip builds in either <#384021699466756107> or <#504436696021204992>, its a rule to not post wip in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:23:27 <@!783425322954784810> is a wip, it looks nice but don't post wips is creations psot them in either <#504436696021204992> or <#384021699466756107>
wip means work in progress
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:30:14 yeah, but dont post wip builds in creations
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:34:03 ok
creations-chat 2020-12-06 18:09:29 no i think you could improve it, its pretty nice as well. although the nose could use some work, i think you could make it pretty stable
creations-chat 2020-12-06 18:13:34 make the nose better, it looks too weird. also do the color in the image, you could motor lock the nose with tnt or disconnectors to make the nose go down aswell
creations-chat 2020-12-06 18:15:35 <@!670636377792184330> nice build <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2020-12-06 18:20:17 nice
creations-chat 2020-12-06 18:23:02 yes
creations-chat 2020-12-06 19:26:49 i downvoted because part of it is a tutorial and exposed motor lock if you wanted to know why i downvoted.
it is also a rule not to post tutorials into <#384025409945337856>. maybe you should read the rules before posting anything <@!550023862876635147>
creations-chat 2020-12-06 19:29:16 ok but still you should read the rules before posting, part of it is a tutorial and exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2020-12-06 20:26:49 looks nice but the hull is weird, and use a custom black for the railings, and maybe make the hull less blocky in the middle
creations-chat 2020-12-06 20:28:50 22, 29, 50 or 27, 42, 53
creations-chat 2020-12-06 20:30:52 oh yeah i can see the curve a little bit, but yeah just use one of those colors that i gave you or use ur own colors if you'd like

creations-chat 2020-12-08 03:46:08 1st off he sent a picture stating it wasnt his even though it was at his base, 2nd of all he lag bombed the server, 3rd of all all that smoke and trails went to other people which is another game rule: don't be a general annoyance to everyone in your server (ex: Flying into other people's creations). 4th of all he spammed emojis so thats 4 broken rules, well not the emoji so 3 rules broken
creations-chat 2020-12-08 03:49:11 that thing doesnt even look like a c 130 it looks more like a blue angels c-130 with a bad nose and odd looking propellers

**fas** nose though

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:42:23 propeller is too tall, the tail looks too weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:43:13 no the whole rotor

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:43:17 keep the rotor

creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:23:37 <@!566765848354750514> doesnt really look like a b-25, way too wide, the propellers are odd, and the turrets
creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:40:08 <@!566765848354750514> yeah probably
creations-chat 2020-12-09 02:32:03 lol
creations-chat 2020-12-09 06:31:07 <@!485999366063259670> yeah because they looked bad in my opinion
creations-chat 2020-12-09 17:49:29 the cockpit is a bit funny and exposed motorlock, but is pretty good
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:18:21 <@!746383586755870821> you can't post wip builds in creations but you can post them in creatiosn feedback
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:24:48 im glad you motorlocked the pvp gusn instead of it being spaced and looking ugly, for that i think its good
especially the shape matches

creations-chat 2020-12-09 20:58:56 i wanna make this but i suck at helicopters because of the rotors not being stable so i might need help on that
creations-chat 2020-12-09 21:01:02 6 for the top rotor, and 4 for the tail rotor
its a skycrane helicopter but its a army version, i'd kinda like it to be my own like a flying rv or something lol and then a version without that and just a payload version
dm me if you wanna help me make the rotors, and maybe help on the design a little bit once im done?
creations-chat 2020-12-09 21:09:20 i always thoguht about that because te photos looked way older than ones now, are the military ones retired or something?

creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:51:02 not **as bad** as i thought it would be, however, you could make the red part of the hull have different color changes, example: like a camo, same with the paint job

also, try to make the smoke stack taller

(what model is it?)

by the way, i can coem help you a little bit if you'd like
creations-chat 2022-01-20 01:07:35 i would click the image so that it's easier to see, but i made a google doc to show you what to fix/add 🙂

creations-chat 2022-03-15 20:27:55 There’s a thing called points. For example, if you get 160 upvotes and 10 downvotes, that’s 150 points. If you get 180 upvotes, and 30 downvotes, that’s also 150 points. See what I mean? Also then you need to DM a mod to see if it should be in the hall of fame or not.

creations-chat 2022-03-19 13:09:19 Looks nice! Would add frames to the canopy, add a slight texture, or potentially a camo, and also if you want add some text details. 🙂
