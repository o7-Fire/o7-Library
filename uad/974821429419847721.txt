general 2022-09-05 12:16:16 Balls
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:57:04 you guys like my plane (its completley original)
general 2022-09-11 21:42:43 pc sucks
general 2022-09-12 12:26:55 zdfxhc
general 2022-09-12 12:26:56 sfgh
general 2022-09-12 12:26:56 szdfh
general 2022-09-12 12:27:19 plane crazy more like motorlock is pain crazy
general 2022-09-12 12:27:45 no i mean on a tiny bouild
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:34:05 i upgraded my new plane
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:57:09 it turns with the help of rockets kinda decent but it doesnt wobble cos of the extra part of the wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:57:34 
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:58:54 motor 2 always gives me issues
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:59:45 ik how to do motor 2 wings but it always makes my plane break plus the plane always veers up or down slightly
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:01:08 ive done that before
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:01:15 still doesnt help
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:01:31 main issue is the plane always fly up a bit while going straight
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:01:40 or down
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:02:28 doesnt work tho it pulls up more the faster i go
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:03:03 motor 2 steeing basically is have one speed or have many issues
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:03:33 i just said tho the faster you go the more it tries to pull up
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:03:42 also if your alternating speed its hellish
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:04:06 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:04:17 so i just spam s and make hte plane shake
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:05:45 motor 2 isnt practical for steering cos if your speeding up or slowing down all the time then your gonna have to adjust your mouse every few seconds and also if its a small plane you cant add too many control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:07:11 ik but im literally saying if it pulls up too hard the mouse aint gonna work
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:07:43 the plane is quite big
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:07:47 i will show you
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:08:02 ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:11:51 33 length 33 width 11 height
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 14:38:12 i did that and i made it shaky but it did work once but i couldnt alternate speed cos it would tile up
general 2022-09-12 20:12:08 how do you post images
general 2022-09-12 20:14:12 how do i check level i forgot

creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:21:22 
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:23:31 supposed to be a hawker harrier but went wrong but its just a random thing to get my motorlock and angle lock to work
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:25:50 Im jut starting to get the hang of motorlock but i need to make omething good with it any ideas? i only really know a few things but it can make stuff with it not like massive vehicles or anything
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:28:53 also i managed to do this so im happy i guess with it
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:34:03 ive played for 2 years but never really followed tuts cos i never seemed to be able to follow them but eventually its worked
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:36:28 no dont worry lol also just did this

creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:08:13 Well im not good at motorlock but this jet is a massive advancement for me.
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:10:37 The motorlock is so the engine on back looks good also so it has more power
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:12:42 it cant be used in pvp due to the amount of stupid op jets but its good for ground targets and looks in general
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:15:36 easy for you to say since your a pro
help 2022-10-20 01:09:44 How to compact motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:10:02 you can
help 2022-10-20 01:10:16 then if not how can you make motors invisible
help 2022-10-20 01:10:24 ^
help 2022-10-20 01:10:33 you can
help 2022-10-20 01:10:51 hold on i have a screenshot of this dude with a functioning character
help 2022-10-20 01:10:55 and its seamless
help 2022-10-20 01:11:43 the one on the left glitched out and lost body parts but that one has invisible motors
help 2022-10-20 01:11:52 i mean right
help 2022-10-20 01:12:28 nope i checked torso and nothing in it
help 2022-10-20 01:12:33 only 1 motor in head
help 2022-10-20 01:12:45 the mech thing is controlled from his plot
help 2022-10-20 01:12:53 so he uses like a no collision glitch
help 2022-10-20 01:13:09 idk
help 2022-10-20 01:13:12 ask them
help 2022-10-20 01:13:33 its so hard actually making motorlock fit on a plane
help 2022-10-20 01:13:52 this is like level 150 difficulty for me
help 2022-10-20 01:15:25 i know angle lock partially
help 2022-10-20 01:15:35 u freeze motorlock to turn something then lock it
help 2022-10-20 01:15:42 ikr
help 2022-10-20 01:15:52 but motorlock being compact is hard
help 2022-10-20 01:17:00 stuff like this
help 2022-10-20 01:17:03 how do they compact it
help 2022-10-20 01:19:25 yeah but how the hell the tracks lie that and everythign else all on one motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:19:39 most i can get on one is an extra engine and some body
help 2022-10-20 01:20:22 best one to date
help 2022-10-20 01:21:36 yeahg but with massive towers theres one block that masees it all up and i just eventually give up trying to fix the isse
help 2022-10-20 01:21:51 i cant
help 2022-10-20 01:22:14 bruh this is why this server sucks
help 2022-10-20 01:22:22 i though <#478584971670454284> was to get help
help 2022-10-20 01:22:26 not to me made fun of
help 2022-10-20 01:22:47 i literally tried for an hour with a plane once and gave up
help 2022-10-20 01:23:26 yeah i know but most of the time u spend a week on a plane for ppl to say its ugly and it doesnt fly well or look good
help 2022-10-20 01:23:54 ive played like sice 2021
help 2022-10-20 01:24:00 and i can barely motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:24:18 probably cos my stupid adhd gets in the way of everything
help 2022-10-20 01:25:26 i know this is angle lock but how with the tank tracks in that image
help 2022-10-20 01:25:59 how did he get it so the tracks somehow fit perfect
help 2022-10-20 01:27:08 yeah how did the motorlock not put the disconnectors all inside eachother
help 2022-10-20 01:27:14 cos when i do that it always does it
help 2022-10-20 01:28:43 basically if you put angle lock on a planes motorlock it locks the angle lock inside something but its literally impossible to have the angle lock stay on differnt layers its hard to explain
help 2022-10-20 01:29:00 what i mean is
help 2022-10-20 01:29:07 if it were my build
help 2022-10-20 01:29:15 the tracks would clip inside eachother
help 2022-10-20 01:30:25 im just gonna draw an example
help 2022-10-20 01:32:45 
help 2022-10-20 01:32:52 thats all i can do
help 2022-10-20 01:32:56 best way to explain
help 2022-10-20 01:33:20 no
help 2022-10-20 01:33:26 bruh
help 2022-10-20 01:33:31 look at it
help 2022-10-20 01:33:39 the angle lock would clip inside the bottom tnk track
help 2022-10-20 01:34:37 image an angle lock attached to the motor if u locked it would clip inside the bottom tank track thing
help 2022-10-20 01:37:19 
help 2022-10-20 01:37:30 if u cant understand i give up
help 2022-10-20 01:37:37 i would have to show u ingame otherwise
creations-chat 2022-10-20 01:39:50 no cos how the hell is motorlock that compact
help 2022-10-20 01:40:35 what im saying is the top part of the tank track would be inside the bottom part of the tank track
help 2022-10-20 01:41:00 also if compact motorlock dont exist
help 2022-10-20 01:41:03 
help 2022-10-20 01:42:47 ok then but im serious the guy in my server has a mech that literally had no motors in the torso and was brobablt only 4x bigger than a roblox player i think it was a protogen mech
help 2022-10-20 01:44:14 it had detail
help 2022-10-20 01:44:30 it could sit down walk better than most mechs it could move its head and ect
