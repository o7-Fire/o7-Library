The Tale of kyle07942 (774348063091195926)
general 2023-02-26 22:10:34 I just joined the server, is it shamed upon in this server to ask about PC2?
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:11:54 is momentum a thing in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:12:36 I'm revamping mine do you have any tips for the way the canopy slides down into the fuselage?
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:18:29 It's like yours but a tad bit smaller
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:18:36 I'm not very good at building yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:18:44 No
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:18:50 I don't like mini builds
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:19:20 It makes it harder to add detail because you have less space to add them in
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:19:56 Is it even possible to make a detailed aircraft like such for pvp??
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:20:45 I met you like a year ago in a public server when you built the first one
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:22:48 I hate how irrelevant I am right now
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:23:35 is gliding even possible with wing pannels
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:24:13 You can get kind of gliding when you spam a bunch of hover engines then disconnect the motor or piston
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:24:19 but no wing pannels
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:25:07 I'm sorry I cant make a good felon because I was too busy trying to make it suitable for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:25:42 I only started getting somewhat good at motorlock when I first started the game again after 2 years
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 22:25:58 and it still took me a month to build a terrible su-57
general 2023-02-26 22:28:10 I got banned for 3 days once because I said Su-57
general 2023-02-26 22:30:14 why do you need a channel called plane crazy to talk about plane crazy in plane crazy's offical server
general 2023-02-26 22:31:31 how do you get off of whitenam
general 2023-02-26 22:31:42 ok
general 2023-02-26 22:31:55 My dad has a bunch of cigarrettes
general 2023-02-26 22:36:26 How do you build an intercontinental cruise missile
general 2023-02-26 22:40:32 How did you just stumble upon that
general 2023-02-26 22:43:51 Type I like cheese popcorn and send
Then type s/eese popc/ild p and send
Enjoy cheese badge on discord
general 2023-02-26 22:44:37 do you want discord cheese badge guys?
general 2023-02-26 22:44:58 Type I like cheese popcorn and send
Then type s/eese popc/ild p and send
Enjoy cheese badge on discord
general 2023-02-26 22:45:30 I still see survival the jack the killer
general 2023-02-26 22:47:05 what does orange name actually mean
general 2023-02-26 22:49:59 Type I like cheese popcorn and send
Then type s/eese popc/ild p and send
Enjoy cheese badge on discord
general 2023-02-26 22:51:35 relatable
general 2023-02-26 22:52:07 what gif did I just see
general 2023-02-26 22:52:11 for like a split second
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:26:20 what does it transform into because transformers are already a thing for planes
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:20 if you hollow out the tank and remove suspension you might be able to fit in room for the moving parts
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:28:09 Are you gonna make the transformation accurate to the figure or just transform
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:30:40 I don't have one so I can't really say much
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:30:48 Bro no way an orange name
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:31:52 dont know why when I saw that for the first time I thought it looked like the gummy elephant meme
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:33:03 for even more accuracy
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:33:13 roblox characters by default are 3ft tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:34:44 lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:38:46 I suppose?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:38:59 Thats the only thing about scale I know
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:29 I don't like roscalwe
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:35 Do it then
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:45 Send video of glass eat
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:41:04 Ok so they are 5,1
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:41:34 But until now I hadn't searched it up since like 2017 or before
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:42:01 According to newer ROBLOX measurements, 1 Stud is 0.28 meters. Therefore, a Roblox character (that is actually 5.5 studs tall) is 154 cm or 5 feet 1 inches tall. I copy and pasted this from google
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:42:53 what
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:42:56 oh
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:43:13 yeah but roblox characters aren't exactly 2 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:44:25 so if you had a roblox character in your hands it's apparently 25 centimeters, about 10 inches tall.
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:45:47 google
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:46:17 according to google 1 meter is 20 studs
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:46:59 what does orange mean
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:47:22 no the role
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:47:25 in this server
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:48:13 also why aren't hover engines allowed for the plane engineer thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:49:09 In what way real life, glitch engine or using them to make your flight more stable
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:49:49 yeah like all planes
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:50:30 like hover engines are a really easy way to generate speed
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:51:04 you just need motor trail and hover and you can make anything with wings fly
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:51:59 super rocket engines aren't very good and glitch engines are banned
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:52:34 It gets annoying having to add a rocket engine wherever you can
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:53:07 because plane crazy doesn't have like an actual realistic engine
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:53:26 no thats the easy part
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:53:50 In plane crazy at least
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:54:25 but plane crazy doesn;t have realistic propulsion
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:54:46 I doubt you will see an actual plane with blue fire coming out of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:56:08 so you aren't allowed to use something unrealistic like exploits but you have to replace that with something that is unrealistic anyway?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:56:17 I said fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:56:43 Thats red
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:56:45 /orange
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:57:13 the engine is the one place where random fire IS meant to cope out
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:57:23 come*
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:57:56 What documents? like the ones on the SR-71 thats are still considered "Classified"
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:58:39 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:58:46 like theese?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:58:55 ^
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:14 My friend has a bunch of leaks
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:33 Not leaks
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:49 Scale for a transformer
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:18:43 I think they did it to make balanced?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:18:58 I dont play warthunder anymore
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:19:19 what
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:19:30 do you want discord cheese badge?#
general 2023-02-27 23:21:25 do you guys want discord cheese badge]
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:25:40 How does camera lock work????
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:26:45 But like if the cams cannt be welded to and part of the plane how do you use them with motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:28:07 I did
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:28:18 the motors it welded to got stuck mid air
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:28:31 The camera stayed in the position it was placed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:29:20 Hold on I'll join plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:29:48 I did
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:02 I clicked it with the screw driver
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:11 and pointed it at the block
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:15 I spawned in
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:19 and it got stuck mid air
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:27 along with the motors it welded to
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:36 I noticed that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:33:45 just tried cam locking, now the parts welded to it donnt even rotate
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:35:48 I wanted to use it to make my build look smoother because anngle lock takes up so much space and makes it hard to cover
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:36:24 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:37:06 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:13:48 why is madvulpen uploading good tutorials
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:15:04 XF-85
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:21:18 I've spent nearly over 3 monnths making an Su-57 just for me to scrap it because it's too hard to change but the mad vulpen uploads a tutorial that really shows me how badly I have skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:23:52 Planes are given the numbers based on how many other designs of the plane they had before the final result I think
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:25:05 You actually did ask why there isnt F110 F109 108 annd 107 - F-1036
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:26:30 Isn't that your own grammar mistake then?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:29:08 Asked what exactly?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:31:43 did I ask you*
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:34:03 concept?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:34:48 why do you need to angle lock the wing anyway?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:35:17 also for that you'd need to send pictures or talk to someone in game with you
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:37:14 custom wedges?
for the up angle just make a motor tower and add motors with power and lock on with like 0.2 speed and make the motors attached to the wing so you can anngle the wing then motorlock it into position
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:40:37 idk cam lock it or somen
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:44:02 Man that is wrong and you know it]
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:44:53 if you have exposed motorlock it is only really useful if you need like an RAF roundel
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:45:29 what as like bolts?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:46:50 Also does plane crazy receive updates other than the summer and winter ones anymore?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:47:51 I feel like this conversation was bound to happen
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:49:51 Idk rickje has unnfunny emojis?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:50:14 <:hmm:1066372797582037012> like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:50:26 oh hold on thats from a different pc server
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:51:28 Does mad(I forgor the rest of the username) even do anything related to plane crazy anymore
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:52:58 <:actually:1073663180120789053>
general 2023-04-10 23:03:27 nice pfp
general 2023-04-10 23:04:42 send picture circling the parts you talkin about
general 2023-04-10 23:05:00 sennd in plane crazy then
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:05:28 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:05:59 also what did you do to the wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:06:17 why are they cut off with cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:06:24 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 08:33:07 can someone help me with my Su-57, I don't know if I have completely ruined the scale
general 2023-04-14 01:39:18 five gum
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:41:05 It has weight but as it is considered a block and not wing panel has no drag
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:42:04 Fun fact: Disconnectors have 45x the weight of trap doors
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:43:59 I use dis connectors because they are universal
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:45:15 Practice for covering up motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:47:05 How small are you making your planes for dis connectors to make a difference in weight????
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:48:12 doesnt nam nam have a tutorial for that?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:49:20 I watched it because I saw someone with mouse guided motor 2 flaps ad I didn't know it was possible
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:49:58 have you built an Su-57
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:50:47 yeah but then you have to line up the flaps to the neutral position when you toggle it off
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:51:36 do you have an Su-57
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:51:40 anyone
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:51:55 How and why
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:52:14 My N key is broken
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:54:18 don't even bother with motor 2s for anything motorlock related THAT SHIT IS GLITCHED BEYOND REPAIR
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:57:52 I'm back
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:12:46 I love how the plane crazy community is split in non aggressive and aggressive and the imo in this sentence proves it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:47:55 Does anyone know how I can make my plane supermanoeuvrable
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 17:55:53 Anyone know how I can make my plane supermanoeuvrable
general 2023-04-15 18:17:02 why do you think
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:32:26 is anyone here anymore
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:32:56 hah I found a friend I haven't see in like 2 years
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:34:37 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:34:58 navy
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:35:11 do you know how to make larger builds supermaneuverable
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:35:54 Isn't upcast dead
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 23:36:11 what happened to him
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 19:17:37 Should I continue to use M2M or should I limit it to only pvp jets because mouse control is really a loss with thrust vector
general 2023-04-18 19:45:16 are whitenames like myself like a really common pokemon card
