help 2022-12-14 02:11:35 how come my hover engine doesnt go past 300+ speed
help 2022-12-14 02:13:33 does having blocks around my hover engine affect it working properly?
general 2022-12-14 02:23:15 what pcc
general 2022-12-14 02:23:25 oh nvm im stupid
help 2022-12-14 02:24:14 why doesnt my hover engine work
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:26:35 i wanna try making the UNSC infinity but idk the dimensions and stuff in plane crazy scale
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 02:27:51 i wanna try making the UNSC infinity from halo but idk the dimensions
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 02:28:13 like how long is it in plane crazy blocks and how wide and how tall and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 02:29:22 idk how to though
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 02:29:39 im not sure where to start cause i dont know how big it would have to be
help 2022-12-14 02:59:28 15 speed 0 drag ignore others OFF
help 2022-12-14 03:11:06 Piston
help 2022-12-14 03:11:20 Everything set to 0 and unpowered
help 2022-12-14 03:11:55 Toward them I believe
help 2022-12-14 03:12:09 I can’t check right now cause I’m in bed

help 2022-12-14 03:12:37 K I will now
help 2022-12-14 03:17:25 How can I use motors for it
help 2022-12-14 03:17:37 Cause I made sure it was facing right way and it was still slow
help 2022-12-14 03:17:54 And yeah it’s being motorlocked so that might be the problem
help 2022-12-14 03:18:54 So I replace it with an unpowered motor?
help 2022-12-14 03:22:42 I replaced it with an unpowered motor and it still didn’t work
help 2022-12-14 03:23:02 Does blocks surrounding it affect it?
help 2022-12-14 03:23:39 <@700813401030393896>
help 2022-12-14 03:24:42 I used a unpowered motor and it still didn’t work properly
help 2022-12-14 03:24:47 Facing them
help 2022-12-14 03:25:21 Lemme figure out how to screenshot on mobile real quick
help 2022-12-14 03:27:58 
help 2022-12-14 03:29:10 Any idea why?
help 2022-12-14 03:30:49 Like barely over 300
help 2022-12-14 03:31:38 Yes
help 2022-12-14 03:35:24 Propellers
help 2022-12-14 03:35:33 For realistic landing
help 2022-12-14 03:35:38 Carrier style l
help 2022-12-14 03:38:21 They are at max speed with no drag
help 2022-12-14 03:39:00 Try putting a motor in the middle?
help 2022-12-14 03:39:16 My friend told me to put one In middle but it did nothing
help 2022-12-14 03:39:19 Lemme try that brb
help 2022-12-14 03:39:53 Small f35
help 2022-12-14 03:40:57

help 2022-12-14 03:46:23 
help 2022-12-14 03:47:47 Idk how to fit them
help 2022-12-14 03:48:03 And I’m on mobile so I can’t completely rebuild it ‘em
help 2022-12-14 03:48:07 Right now
help 2022-12-14 03:48:45 I don’t think making them a set of four would make it speed up by several hundred
help 2022-12-14 03:48:57 I could probably do that
help 2022-12-14 03:49:04 Like a set of four
help 2022-12-14 03:49:12 Nvm it would stick out of back
help 2022-12-14 03:49:35 Lemme get on my computer and try
help 2022-12-14 03:55:08 This is risky cause if I get caught I’ll be in trouble lol
help 2022-12-14 03:59:03 ok i rebuilt the engines higher up on the motorlock tower with two sets of 4 thrusters and it made me go about 400 speed so it did increase it
help 2022-12-14 03:59:24 ill try adding another
help 2022-12-14 04:01:45 holy crap that definitely worked its going about 750 speed now
help 2022-12-14 04:02:16 thanks lol
help 2022-12-14 04:05:30 only problem is that it shakes a little bit but ill figure out how to fix it
help 2022-12-14 04:21:40 i thought it was cause of my speed
help 2022-12-14 04:21:48 also im able to go over 1 k speed lol
help 2022-12-14 04:22:46 yeah
help 2022-12-14 04:22:58 also my plane is quite small so it will get very unstable if i made it any faster
help 2022-12-14 04:23:54 its much shakier all of a sudden
help 2022-12-14 04:25:49 all over the place lol
help 2022-12-14 04:26:38 basically has a seizure mid air
help 2022-12-14 04:27:09 actually its mostly up and down
help 2022-12-14 04:27:17 normal stuff
help 2022-12-14 04:27:29 does metal make things heavier?
help 2022-12-14 04:27:55 let me lower the max angle
help 2022-12-14 04:27:58 of my control flaps
help 2022-12-14 04:28:06 that might have something to do with this
help 2022-12-14 04:28:51 fantom_forces101
help 2022-12-14 04:28:53 joins are on
help 2022-12-14 04:31:53 whats your user
help 2022-12-14 04:32:12 nvm i see you
help 2022-12-15 02:24:26 no cause its working fine for me
help 2022-12-15 02:24:42 im working on a new darkstar aircraft though that will go like 5k+ speed cause why not
help 2022-12-15 02:26:09 it sucks though
help 2022-12-15 02:26:24 im basing it off of like one picture that i ever saw of it
help 2022-12-15 02:27:53 wait that was a pic of it earlier this is the newer picture
help 2022-12-15 02:28:08 right now its going about 1.3 k and is smooth but i dont have any altitude rudders so i cant properly test it yet
help 2022-12-15 02:28:58 holy crap nvm its going about 2.3 k
help 2022-12-15 02:29:09 pic of it not loading in
help 2022-12-15 02:29:12 <@700813401030393896>
help 2022-12-15 03:17:50 darkstar
general 2023-01-07 01:01:40 has there still not been any real information on plane crazy 2 coming out?
help 2023-01-07 06:23:52 my flying dorito is hard to control and every time i try to turn it leans really far down and loses altitude quite quickly and idk what to do to fix it
help 2023-01-07 06:24:15 im not sure how to add rudder to a b2 since they dont have vertical rudders
help 2023-01-07 06:27:37 i can be basically on my side and and my plane will be angled really weirdly and not control very well and it makes turning quite difficult
creations-chat 2023-01-07 16:20:25 work in progress b2 bomber that can drift lol working on adding some landing gear and a realistic bomb bay with guided cluster missiles or bombs
creations-chat 2023-01-07 16:23:06 wait are you not able to do that? i guess for the most part its finished its just i havent added the pvp aspects to it yet
creations-chat 2023-01-07 16:25:41 oh well i guess it is finished though idk if i even want to add landing gears or a bomb bay yet
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:34:32 its my b2 that im working on and is basically done
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:36:43 engines are supposed to be flat? also this was my first big non tutorial build and i think it ended up somewhat decent also im doing cockpit later and i just built it off of a model on Sketchfab
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:42:31 slightly more updated picture i finished the front landing gear and gonna start the back soon also i dont see a problem with the engines also on the model i used i think the wings were slightly wider on edges
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:44:37 also is the b2 a black/grey color or a slight blueish color?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:47:58 in majority of the pictures i see its a blue color also just edit messages to talk cause stupid cooldown
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:51:57 i think ill keep the wingtips the same for now cause it will be painful to fix them cause ill have to fix the rudders and stuff
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:54:31 whats the issue with the engines cause i dont see anything wrong with them
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:58:59 tbh i cant tell a difference other than length but the top one looks the best although i have no idea what the su 35 looks like so yes
creations-chat 2023-01-24 02:12:47 im trying to make the UNSC infinity and want it to be the biggest but realistic size ratio so i did some math and stuff and the ratio of length:width:height is about 6.8:1:1.2 and i need help to figure out the perfect size for it
creations-chat 2023-01-24 02:15:03 i dumbed it down for you
creations-chat 2023-01-24 02:17:58 i know the ratio but when i did some other stuff to figure out the optimal width it came back as 22.5 blocks wide which is a bit too wide considering its literally almost half the plot and all the sides need to be about equal also 6.8 : 1 : 1.2 was just a rough estimate
creations-chat 2023-01-24 02:22:23 when i divided 39 by 1.25 cause 39 is how tall the plot is i got about 32.5 for the width which does not make sense cause of the other estimates giving me things like 22.5
creations-chat 2023-01-26 00:48:24 sorry
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 18:57:04 just a normal day in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 18:58:00 what is happening lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 18:59:24 why do i keep getting flung every time i drive my tank into the water
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 19:00:22 why?
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 19:06:00 i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 19:09:07 wait,
thats illegal
general 2023-02-05 03:01:24 how did you get all those roles lol
general 2023-02-05 03:03:37 most of my builds are tutorials lol
general 2023-02-05 03:03:40 i suck at building
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 04:02:48 why am i invisible and my dead body is just lying there
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 04:03:43 i reset and it fixed it lol
creations-chat 2023-04-02 04:18:36 i need some kinda 4th gen fighter that is pretty simple to try building because i suck at building and most of my stuff is tuts and i want to improve my skill
help 2023-04-04 02:00:33 for some reason every time  i take off in my jet my ailerons freeze up and stop working, so it will just spin out of control every time they work fine on the ground and usually work but they just randomly stopped
help 2023-04-04 02:02:23 they just lock up on the left position which makes my plane go to the left
help 2023-04-04 02:02:43 worked fine before but now they arent working
help 2023-04-04 02:03:01 yes but not around that area
help 2023-04-04 02:03:03 nothing is obstructing it
help 2023-04-04 02:04:20 nothing
help 2023-04-04 02:04:29 they work fine on the ground but then lock up as soon as i take off
help 2023-04-04 02:04:39 usually resulting in me nose diving into the ground since i cant control it
help 2023-04-04 02:05:15 well fudge
help 2023-04-04 02:05:25 idk how i can replace them for rn but still be as effective
help 2023-04-19 21:51:21 why are control panels not working :/
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 01:54:27 control panels have been broken for me for months for some reason and im not able to build or develop missiles because of it
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 01:55:51 any know any idea why or how i can fix it?
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:16:31 what game is that
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:16:56 similar to plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:24:32 joined it and its way better
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:25:49 yeah this is actually insane
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:29:10 does motorlocking exist?
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 02:29:13 or anything similar?
general 2023-05-27 01:02:23 how can i make a circle that can spin around the outside of my space ship
general 2023-05-27 01:14:09 put a jumbo sized truck in the bed of the truck, and then a small rc truck in the bed of the jumbo sized truck inside the bed of the mega jumbosized truck
general 2023-05-27 01:14:17 W idea
general 2023-06-05 04:05:11 how many i make myself stop joining the same stupid pvp server
general 2023-06-05 04:06:40 how can i stop joining the same stupid dead pvp server
general 2023-06-05 04:07:10 no u
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:07:26 how can i stop joining the same dead pvp server
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:07:53 thats cool and all but what is it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:08:20 how
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:08:29 server hopping just makes me join the same one
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:08:37 even if i go to non pvp and back to pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:08:44 ikr
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:08:54 what is it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:07 no idea what that is
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:08 2/10
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:25 just looks like a hunk of junk to me
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:42 oh thats basically what the ship is just looked it up
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:08 i know ijust looked it up
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:19 
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:28 why are you only building the left engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:39 also yellow is too bright
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:45 supposed to be a faded orange
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:02 well finish the test an build the rest
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:06 hey that rhymed
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:07 i think
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:43 literally get working on finishing it then
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:49 simple as that
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:51 then i will rate it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:04 whats that supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:13 just looks like a hunk uh junk
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:39 just copy that on the right
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:43 after building main body
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:51 just build a place holder body the same width as the actual thing
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:59 then build right engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:05 then finish up the center body
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:10 did you not read what i just said
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:24 build a placeholder body the same width as actual body
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:26 then do engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:31 then finish main body
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:34 simple as that
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:44 then put a 1x7
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:47 then build engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:13:48 ez
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:14:04 then why you not building it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:14:20 what
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:15:52 we cant rate it when we cant tell what it is
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:15:57 finish ship and then we can rate it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:16:03 ez
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:16:11 was it really that hard?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:19:26 i know the very basics of it cause of summit builds su57 tut that was hell to build
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:51:50 how would that work
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 05:14:39 build a hyper realistic f22
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 06:17:26 im going super sonic speeds on a chunk of helium
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 06:17:55 im tempted to leave it on overnight to see how fast it can get going
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 06:18:02 some other guy got to like 500k before i disconnected
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 06:18:21 nvm i fell off it
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:25:52 whats a small propulsion system that can launch something far and can fit in a large ish bullet
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:26:13 magnets dont work well enough
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:31:22 any other ideas that would work
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:31:24 since your a nerd
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:35:06 anything else?
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:37:57 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:38:39 how do i do that
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:38:51 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:39:01 i could but i need the bullets to take up a small amount of space each
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:39:13 so i can build them close enough to put them all in a magazine i can load into a gun
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 04:52:40 Not really a way for me to connect the front and back if the bullet
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:32:04 Yeah but I want it to be realistic
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:32:30 Have it where the back launched the front part of the bullet forward and then the back can get ejected out of the side of the gun
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:33:02 I had a working prototype that worked pretty well but the bullets were not very fast and I want to remake it
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:33:45 <@434843195025653762>
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:36:30 I’d have to figure out how to connect the pieces together if it were a hover engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 05:36:39 Which I can probably do tomorrow
general 2023-07-07 03:56:36 random guess is in the next couple months since this is in preparation for converting builds into pc 2
general 2023-07-07 04:05:30 yo W update i can now fly my summit build su57 at +2 fps
general 2023-07-07 04:12:33 how do you get ranks and stuff
general 2023-07-07 04:13:17 we have given him years with basically nothing in return
general 2023-07-15 04:04:18 i placed a control flap and got kicked cause of error 69
