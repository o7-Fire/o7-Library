plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:04:57 just shoot them
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:05:36 also who here thinks spinning suspensions are good at yeeting things
bot-central 2022-07-19 19:05:54 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:08:10 it would be hard to make considering the fact that they have no tail fin
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:09:18 you could do the wing part and you could try to use motors to fold and unfold the wings if you wanted
bot-central 2022-07-19 19:09:27 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:14:40 if replacing the wings doesn't work just cut off the wings strap some wheels on and you have a car

plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:16:53 probably could make something
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:17:08 it would look good on some sort of starfighter
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 19:20:20 you just need to add more seats, but your friends cant fly it

plane-crazy 2022-07-20 17:12:51 if you want to make something really unstable you should use damping 0 free length 10 stiffness 100 suspension
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 17:12:57 just a suggestion

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 00:58:34 who here thinks saws might be able to be used sorta like wheels in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:05:22 i would totally NOT try and make a tank with them
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:07:51 if there are nukes in pc2 i would make the tank with saw wheels and nukes instead of blocks
the-dump 2022-07-21 01:09:06 sane people make DIY earplug guns
the-dump 2022-07-21 01:10:28 try making underwater project orion and make it poop nukes behind it for thrust
the-dump 2022-07-21 01:10:46 i understand how cool space is
the-dump 2022-07-21 01:11:11 its almost absolute zero

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:17:42 my friend made a winch on a boat once so yes i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:19:53 still was a winch, could just be strapped onto a truck
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:20:02 and made into a crane
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:21:27 i do know giant robot fire ants with wheels instead of legs that breath fire and can swim are possible, i made one

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:24:05 that is NOT how cranes work
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:24:19 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:25:22 you could just slap motors on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:26:32 make a flying tank that can hold a plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:26:44 my friend tried to make that once
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:26:54 did not go well
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:29:02 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:29:17 unless it is supposed to mow galaxies
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:29:32 ok then yes
bot-central 2022-07-21 01:30:06 !rank

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:30:51 add more
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:32:44 use smoke pipes for shredded grass bits
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:38:12 add cutters on the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:39:03 now get an alt to make grass and cut it
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 01:51:06 he probably thinks his machine is malfunctioning
