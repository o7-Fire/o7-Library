help 2020-04-11 16:28:45 Images are above
help 2020-04-11 16:29:03 I tried to ping a mod since I was told they were technically supposed to
help 2020-04-11 16:29:30 Yes?

help 2020-04-11 16:34:49 Regardless of having all of the clear requirements... Makes sense
help 2020-04-11 16:35:36 The rank requirements are posted right there
help 2020-04-11 16:36:26 Fine by me I'm literally just here for a single suggestion
help 2020-04-11 16:37:19 Lovely. It still shows that I'm not able to post in suggestions regardless of being ranked
help 2020-04-11 16:38:12 Do I put it in bot commands, then?
