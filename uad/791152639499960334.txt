plane-crazy 2022-12-31 02:37:06 rip previous train track builds if the width

plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:13:52 ye
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:14:10 ahh
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:14:25 heck no
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:14:35 my friend and I are having a build battle
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:14:41 no time limit tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:14:46 so
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:15:11 
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:15:22 that's how long so far
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:15:27 a 10
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:15:34 it's diffrent from our styles
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:15:55 so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:16:14 his is about 5x the size of mine
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:16:19 he has to fold his
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:16:31 mine is a little bigger than the arrow
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:03 I'm learning motor lock still
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:30 so the most I can so is to add stuff for detail
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:50 we added a speed limit <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:57 so its 200-700
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:18:08 for speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:18:21 mainly bc my jets be zooming and my friends aren't
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:18:54 that's what I'm gonna do
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:19:00 he doesn't have an engine yet
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:19:29 he knows how to
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:19:39 I just think he doesn't know exactly how to use one
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:20:06 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:20:12 the a 10 engines r decor
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:20:17 not even useful
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:20:35 it's 28 blocks each
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:20:41 the engine is in the tail
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:21:39 well
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:21:46 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:22:11 we have a weapon requirement too
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:22:29 these are the minimal amount of weapons
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:22:32 ye
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:22:36 we always do
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:22:45 2 guns, 3 rockets, and thatsbit
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:23:14 we usually do an hour build
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:23:22 then 3 rounds of pvp
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:24:41 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:24:45 we found it
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:25:10 and started by shining rockets on blocks and the tut jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:25:20 then another friend hopped on pc with us for a week
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:25:38 thats wheen all 3 of us had a build battle of utensils
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:25:55 and added hover engines to tut jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:26:02 mine actually won
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:26:26 it was a pencil, uncontrollable but it looked like it was writing cursive so mine won
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:27:05 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:27:57 when I started my pencil had better chance against og shredders (back when they really started popping up) than my jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:28:15 yeah maybe motors
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:28:57 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:29:10 I had an idea if lock motors for a one block width
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:29:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:31:06 well you could lock the motor in place of the wheel and use a trail to combine them
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:31:18 (best my 1 iq brain can explain)
general 2022-12-31 05:31:38 skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:32:06 yeah...
