plane-crazy 2021-10-14 00:56:27 that pops up so much i hate it
general 2021-10-14 08:47:11 what  blocks are the legs?
general 2021-10-14 08:48:01 they dont look like ladders
general 2021-10-14 08:48:49 even so ladders arent that thick
general 2021-10-14 08:49:22 they still arent as thick as that xd
general 2021-10-14 08:49:37 <@!730808827234091041>
general 2021-10-14 08:51:04 well anyway how is the couch motorlocked to look like it as it is.. i dont see any obvious spots where they would be
general 2021-10-14 08:51:55 look at the right leg
general 2021-10-14 08:52:07 i  dont see how thats possible to be motorlocked
general 2021-10-14 08:53:06 that would make sense now
general 2021-10-14 08:54:53 ah yeah that would make sense how they are connected.. thx xd
general 2021-10-14 08:55:39 duck
general 2021-10-14 08:56:04 big duck
general 2021-10-18 08:11:30 simply turn on arm on key and after you shoot arm that ball OR manually blow up them after shooting
general 2021-10-18 08:12:58 like issues on the site? no. what are you experiencing
general 2021-10-18 08:13:24 explain?
general 2021-10-18 08:14:06 take that screenshot and your experience in detail to the roblox support
general 2021-10-18 08:14:21 that shouldnt happen and i am not experiencing anything like that
general 2021-10-18 08:14:31 i just refreshed the page and im normal
general 2021-10-18 08:14:38 and np
general 2021-10-18 08:31:03 well i doubt anyone is going to dodge a fast bullet if they are playing roblox.. so dont have it go light speed then sinply time the bullets arming after you shoot
general 2021-10-18 08:31:48 damn
general 2021-10-18 08:31:55 lead your shots then
general 2021-10-18 08:32:36 then you wont be able to time the arming
general 2021-10-18 08:32:46 and therefor there is no solution
general 2021-10-18 08:33:27 then you have to slow it down and get better at using the gun and leading shots
general 2021-10-18 08:33:43 and when people see your gun pointing at them they are sure to zip outa there
general 2021-10-18 08:33:59 damn
general 2021-10-18 08:34:06 now add a 5
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 00:07:33 motor lock is actually really simple one you understand the main rule
help 2021-10-28 03:09:59 is there any way to paint the middle of these so the white lines are gone?
help 2021-10-28 03:38:12 yeah but when i go to place the next block one side isnt colored so it apears part colored and part white like the darker red in the midle
help 2021-10-28 03:39:00 having two paint blocks next to eachother allows you to color one of the two blocks sides that are touching but you cant color both
help 2021-10-28 03:42:25 ah oki thx
help 2021-10-28 03:43:47 what stuff i had in the pic was a magma cube im making and i am just making the thing mostly out of normal blocks and on corners im using the paint blocks so ill keep that in mind when i do the bottom and top
general 2021-10-30 20:42:07 how many people here are actually able to play
general 2021-10-30 20:42:21 im 16 and i find the games i play fun
general 2021-10-30 20:43:55 imagine playing adopt me
general 2021-10-30 20:49:00 i play lots of other games on steam and stuff.. i play like 10 ish games on roblox.. maybe up to 15 tops
general 2021-10-31 23:32:35 i need it to be confirmed.. can everyone play any roblox game now?
general 2021-10-31 23:33:09 fr i felt so damn bored with roblox gone
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:02:41 is it possible to make an object go down 3 quarters off the block grid using motorlock somehow?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:04:24 if it isnt from rl and isnt from a game or movie or anything its litterally impossible to guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:04:45 what exactly do you want people to guess anyway
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:06:07 sr just give up they are too dense to realise that this guessing game is never going to end as there is no answer
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:55:27 is there a way to make a block 3 quarters down
general 2021-11-28 13:31:37 lmao

creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:52:47 ah okay then.. but maybe go all sides or at least more than the front... also what is the stalker thing.. is it a location in some game or movie?
general 2021-12-06 00:55:18 id assume the same event happens every single summer and winter until the last devs die... hopefully there is a spring and fall events too
general 2021-12-06 00:56:04 no the winter event is easilly identified by the map being under snow
general 2021-12-06 00:56:22 and its snowing weather people turned on the map snow blower or not
general 2021-12-06 00:56:24 np

creations-chat 2021-12-06 19:34:25 probobly finish coloring the front but design wise my words hold no weight as ive never built a boat like these myself so i dont really have any feedback design wise but the greys over the red could use touching up

creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:22:37 i dont exactly have infinite room so i cant do better.. golem is fucking massive for a 1-1 scale to look like that
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:27:02 ok and? im not the best at this damn game? thats litterally like comparing a teens strength to a full adults and expecting them to match up... like give me a break ffs

help 2022-08-01 23:57:57 id say make the two front controll pannels your E and Q to tilt then the other 4 for W and S to turn
help 2022-08-01 23:58:08 you'd be flying like they do planes irl
help 2022-08-01 23:58:14 tilt then pull up
help 2022-08-01 23:59:37 ig
