general 2021-02-28 23:20:24 its not
general 2021-02-28 23:20:27 it dosent look good
general 2021-02-28 23:20:47 i want to be able to land realisticly without wiplash
general 2021-02-28 23:21:02 an airport runway is like 9000 feet
general 2021-02-28 23:21:16 the baselpate is 2000 max
general 2021-02-28 23:22:10 no
general 2021-02-28 23:22:14 thats not what im saying
general 2021-02-28 23:22:19 im saying
general 2021-02-28 23:22:22 its possible to land atm
general 2021-02-28 23:22:54 i **can** land large planes on the baseplate, but it dosent look realistic and is difficult
general 2021-02-28 23:23:24 i dont think ur getting my point
general 2021-02-28 23:23:34 im not saying its too difficult to land
general 2021-02-28 23:23:41 i like the difficulty
general 2021-02-28 23:23:57 IM SAYING
IT DOSENT LOOK REALISTIC TO LAND ON SUCH A SHORT SPACE
general 2021-02-28 23:24:03 READ IT
general 2021-02-28 23:24:05 bruh
general 2021-02-28 23:24:15 i am perfectly capable of landing
general 2021-02-28 23:24:17 not
general 2021-02-28 23:24:17 its
general 2021-02-28 23:24:18 hard
general 2021-02-28 23:24:24 it looks terrible
general 2021-02-28 23:24:28 and is unrealistic
general 2021-02-28 23:24:35 to land an a380 in 2k feet
general 2021-02-28 23:24:46 thats my point
general 2021-02-28 23:24:48 i just said it
general 2021-02-28 23:25:20 bruh im not saying i want a bigger runway cos its too hard to land
general 2021-02-28 23:25:37 what
general 2021-02-28 23:25:46 yes
general 2021-02-28 23:26:01 <@!403843930543882241> is small brain
general 2021-02-28 23:26:08 cos it look sunrealistic
general 2021-02-28 23:26:09 to land
general 2021-02-28 23:26:12 on small runway
general 2021-02-28 23:26:15 with huge plane
general 2021-02-28 23:26:37 yall turned this into an argument
general 2021-02-28 23:26:51 i originally just said "it would be nice to have a longer runway"

general 2021-02-28 23:30:00 nah
general 2021-02-28 23:31:13 i was expecting a reaction sorta like "yeah whenever i land my planes it looks bad"

general 2021-03-01 05:43:19 Studs per secon?
general 2021-03-01 05:43:26 Ok
general 2021-03-01 05:43:31 Kk
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:20:58 good morning
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:21:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:21:46 yea but Roblox person is not realistically proportioned
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:11 wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:13 RThro
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:23 how tall is rthro
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:27 oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:29 kk
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:41 i used to base it off height but didnt really work for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:49 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:50 did that
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:22:52 yep
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:00 and then convert that to studs
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:05 and you got ur scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:12 but wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:25 a block is thicker than a normal fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:33 which means you should have it slightly larger
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:40 so its not cramped
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:23:54 and things look smaller in roblox 3rd person than they actually are
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:24:21 kk
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:24:41 shh
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:24:54 go bacc to no rank placce
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:25:12 lol i was joking
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:25:19 no worries you can join
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:25:21 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:27:05 
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:27:12 seems about right to me
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:27:40 emkay
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:27:43 how about
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:28:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:28:46 ahhaaaa
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:28:48 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:14 your other scale was ok (different scales for different needs) but thats like waaaaaaaay off
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:26 for example captianmarcin uses 3 studs/meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:43 a block is 2 studs
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:49 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:56 i just went along with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:29:58 like
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:30:03 "okay cool"
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:30:37 nah
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:30:41 you do you
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:09 yea me 2
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:13 :/
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:42 im adjusting the afterburners on my f15
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:43 nope
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:31:57 i dont base my scale off characters
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:32:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:32:48 but like i said
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:32:55 characters arent good for scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:33:15 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:33:23 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:33:25 but
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:33:37 scales change based on your needs
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:33:46 what are you using the scale for
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:34:05 kk use mine then
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:34:11 its mostly for airliners
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:34:30 ima stop talking wiht u bc ur very stubborn and annoying and not listening to me at all
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:34:55 1.6 studs are 1 meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:15 ugh
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:25 heres a 737-200 using the scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:28 thats way offf
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:31 i dont use that
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:41 eee my screenshots
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:35:55 it is
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:36:03 not by just a bit
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:36:12 if its just a it its for a diff purpose
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:36:32 that makes it so theres 3 studs for a meter about
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:36:44 which is getting pretty unrealistic for planes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:37:37 
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:37:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:37:54 its in 1.6 per meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:38:14 and theres also a good amount of space inside
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:38:38 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:38:49 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:39:12 i will hear you out if you stop telling me how the roblox character relates to blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:39:20 dont use the roblox character
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:02 theres
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:05 the way it looks
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:09 the space inside
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:16 the amount of seats in a row
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:22 the cockpt
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:27 doors
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:40:34 floor height
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:02 if you combne all the factors and tweak it you can get a very realistic scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:06 ik
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:25 i saw a guy with a 777 and the right amount of seats and its like
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:30 idk
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:34 15 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:41:45 yea but it can give you a sorta indicator
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:01 if ur 737 has two ailses
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:05 somethins off
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:32 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:34 well
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:35 here
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:42:54 its not like its way bigger
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:43:09 its a couple inches wider to compensate for the chonkiness of the blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:44:31 but i wil leave you with some advice so you can come up with your own
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:10 take the variables i told you about and just tweak if something feels to small or too big and eventually you will arrive at your own scale that works well
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:17 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:28 one secc
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:35 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:36 just
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:40 be careful about that
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:45:50 kk
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:46:32 
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:46:36 tanks are annoying to make to scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:46:48 tha hair is a bit taller tha
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:46:49 tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:47:48 
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:48:22 much oogly
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:48:33 okay
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:48:46 keep in mind that might not coincide with vision
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:49:04 i find that robloians look smaller even against mathematically correct planes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:49:06 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:49:10 the planes look smaller
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:49:49 dosent work well
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:49:55 for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:01 nah
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:26 not really
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:30 i use
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:35 1.6 studs per meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:38 which is
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:44 0.8 blocks per meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:50:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:20 ye but i put that into numbers
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:24 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:37 that sucks tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:48 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:57 thats not what i said
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:51:59 i said
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:52:09 0.8 blocks per meter
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:52:58 its not abysmally hard to say what is 80% of a given length
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:03 watch
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:43 
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:50 it is
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:58 i use it and it works well
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:53:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:54:10 look in creations 100% of my builds are with that scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:54:20 use the by: mrhoboyeti
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:55:21 you just did all the required math
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:55:22 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:55:30 its really not har
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:55:40 here
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:55:44 let me put it this way
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:56:14 if you want a very realistic looking build that is as close to IRL as possible you can use the scale, if you just want to make a thing then you ddont need to
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:57:04 yea thats what i just said basically
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:57:22 but real life size isnt really an opinion type thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:57:54 if youre making a plane and you arent concerned about making the most realistic thing possible who cares what scale you use
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:58:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:58:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:58:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:58:12 excactly
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:58:44 if you want a more realistic interior then do that but if youu want a more realistic exterior then use my scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 18:00:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 18:02:52 im making cover plane in blender
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 18:03:01 7
