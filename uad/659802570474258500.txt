creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:01:37 yhe
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:03:17 but i didnt wanted to make a small hydroplane , so i went with a bomber , and it was either this or a PBY , and other options were to big for my limited saving space
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:05:33 what im thinking
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:05:53 is that ill make most of the wing out of halfblocks
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:06:13 yhe i know
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:06:23 guess they forgot to remove it
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:06:55 that cuz i first made some dstroyers and then i went to the USS Baltimore
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:08:43 Wana see the most illegal thing i own: Shipwright V and IV
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:08:59 english
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:10:14 that was most likely spanish
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:10:18 or italian
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:10:26 something latin
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:10:34 it wast romanian tho
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:11:09 noice
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:35:12 
creations-chat 2020-05-27 15:35:13 Ok so i did dome progress on the plane and it looks pretty well so far , also it gained the ability to float properly
creations-chat 2020-05-27 18:00:05 Ok so this is my hydroplane so far

creations-chat 2020-05-30 18:03:07 Took a while for me to actually post it in creations but there it is , the finished model
creations-chat 2020-05-30 18:03:16 
creations-chat 2020-05-30 18:03:19 
creations-chat 2020-05-30 18:54:58 its a AMX 13 90 , you cant really make out the difference on this build but i chose the 90 mm version cuz its canon is thicker
creations-chat 2020-05-30 18:55:16 the oscilating turret wotks great btw
creations-chat 2020-05-30 19:08:43 it looks unfinished
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:31:18 Well i kinda ran out of ideas
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:31:33 also i based it of a photo
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:32:37 its better on my panter
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:33:31 the cammo doesn't work just cuz there are a lot of long wedges
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:34:51 For example this looks nicer
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:35:06 
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:36:23 And also yhe , big vehicles are vrey easy to be destroyed by small one cuz when a noob makes a kamikaze plane and pushes it into you , you lag out
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:36:37 and no anchor block can save you
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:38:32 idk i dont work on rockets
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:39:48 hmm well i know someone who made such thing
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:40:22 but its most likely a coil spring suspension
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:41:01 it is a VVSS suspension
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:42:14 i think that if you search cheftain's video on youtube bout it he will tell you
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:42:38 what italian tank ?
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:44:16 huh
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:46:43 Yhe i see
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:47:00 havent quite seen one of those in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:47:42 but ive seen L3/33 tanket's
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:48:47 i think ima make the HMS Grafton
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:50:23 Initialy i wanted to go for a Russian Destroyer or Light Cruiser but theyr guns calliber is so small compared to the ship that i would have to upsize the whole ship
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:51:49 I mean look at this
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:52:59 And the rest have some secondary cannons that annoy me
creations-chat 2020-05-31 18:53:57 
creations-chat 2020-05-31 19:29:22 You can try making a balista
creations-chat 2020-06-01 18:52:02 Im making the SRK Groza i think its going great so far
creations-chat 2020-06-01 18:52:18 
creations-chat 2020-06-01 18:52:18 
creations-chat 2020-06-01 18:52:20 
creations-chat 2020-06-01 18:53:20 Idk after making ships like the USS Baltimore its nice to calm down and make something smaller
creations-chat 2020-06-01 19:00:11 i think its a improvement over my first destroyer , which also happened to be my first folding ship and my first ship made after almost 9 months
creations-chat 2020-06-11 06:53:01 <@!628240580517953538> i would like to know why the ME 262 looks exactly like mine
creations-chat 2020-06-11 06:54:53 
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:02:43 even the motors at the wings
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:03:16 witch so far are unique to my design of the Me 262
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:03:51 the back wing is placed lower , as on my model
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:04:39 not to mention the exact same technique on the tail
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:05:40 and the same nose and  measures for the nose
creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:06:43 and the cockpit which you just made 1 block longer but has the same shape
creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:07:54 What do you think of the Do 217 M 1 i put together  ?
creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:08:02 
creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:08:02

creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:16:10 a night cammo should do
creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:16:44 ehh its not
creations-chat 2020-06-12 17:20:13 the tail has roughly the same length as the distance between the engine and the body

creations-chat 2020-07-13 08:24:54 a battleship or a heavy cruiser
creations-chat 2020-07-13 08:25:15 i would use rockets in the breaches of the main canons

creations-chat 2020-10-10 16:20:33 you may be right but, what i would say you should do is, het the canon a bit lower
creations-chat 2020-10-10 16:21:04 yhe, it desnt quitef look the same
creations-chat 2020-10-10 16:21:52 make the canon breach less square and longer

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 09:58:09 yhe but its still pretty painfull
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 09:58:38 however some radial engines can put that to shame with ease
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 09:59:45 took shorter to fix it than i expected
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 10:01:28 thats how motorlocking is in general
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 10:17:07 yhe that is a lot of motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 10:49:20 the back is kinda wack
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 10:58:56 Try motor angleing  over there
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 13:26:06 without seeing the plane close up it cant tell

general 2020-11-26 18:19:29 if he has the phantom than i have the F 18
general 2020-11-26 18:22:32 You dont know what boom and zoom is ?
general 2020-11-26 18:23:12 Basically you get altitude advantage and then come from the top on you're enemy
general 2020-11-26 18:23:33 not like the P 47 does
general 2020-11-26 18:24:02 At haigh alt ye
general 2020-11-26 18:24:16 but usually you dont find em there
general 2020-11-26 18:24:31 and the 109 can still outclimb it
general 2020-11-26 18:26:10 kinda, yes
general 2020-11-26 18:26:46 yes
general 2020-11-26 18:27:11 even when you can dogfight is allways better to boom and zoom
general 2020-11-26 18:27:29 the 109 is a brcik at all times
general 2020-11-26 18:27:47 that one too
general 2020-11-26 18:28:08 19 sec turn time isnt far better than 20
general 2020-11-26 18:30:44 no it does not
general 2020-11-26 18:30:50 cuz you use gunpods
general 2020-11-26 18:31:04 ow
general 2020-11-26 18:31:14 well thats a relief
general 2020-11-26 18:31:30 the 262 is dogshit
general 2020-11-26 18:31:46 cuz any othe jet slaps it
general 2020-11-26 18:32:07 why not ?
general 2020-11-26 18:32:36 climb
general 2020-11-26 18:32:45 yes exactly
general 2020-11-26 18:32:51 you just climb
general 2020-11-26 18:32:54 ez
general 2020-11-26 18:33:13 the G2 has even better
general 2020-11-26 18:33:40 dude the Bf 109 G 2 has 23m/s climb rate
general 2020-11-26 18:33:47 at 4.3
general 2020-11-26 18:34:05 IK

general 2020-11-26 18:34:54 and the canon birds
general 2020-11-26 18:35:09 it rolls like shit
general 2020-11-26 18:35:19 the roll
general 2020-11-26 18:35:23 its abisimal
general 2020-11-26 18:35:42 if you do smoe evasive manuvers against it
general 2020-11-26 18:35:47 it cant keep up
general 2020-11-26 18:35:59 even with a P 38 it works
general 2020-11-28 09:34:30 I persoanlly would chose a smaller one
general 2020-11-28 09:34:42 what does the big one help with ?
general 2020-11-28 09:35:15 its just more physics lag less compact derails and more work for less
general 2020-11-28 09:35:58 idk

creations-chat 2021-09-02 14:27:56 Yes, yes, , now i have a foto here, leme see if i can bring it, the point is, the launcher is quite fine, however, you have done the compaeriment in the front wrong, primarely the front window protection. Even without checking i can see that you tried to do some armor on the front but it sticks out way too much, you should of used smaller pecies motorlocked closer and then pistonlocked so it just slightly sticks out while angled, that is my main issue   I can overlook other stuff maybe , but not that. Hope it helped, i usually dont like to overexplain stuff like this but your build is pretty good so I gave you this peice of explanation.

creations-chat 2021-11-17 18:44:05 I guess , I mean it was a cramped piece of shit, but it got quite the building challenges, not only does it have a pike nose but also some other plates in the front. it also has the pan like turret.
creations-chat 2021-11-17 18:46:53 still, I got to finish the I 400 first which I'm quite proud of, however I can not make a hangar with planes in storage without making it oversized, still I have a version of it that can launch planes.
