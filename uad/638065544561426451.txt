plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:29 Saunders roe princess
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:32 Boeing 314
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:35 Martin M130
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:32:40 That type of plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:19 Master can only build warships and fighter jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:26 But i dont use motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:30 Thats the whole point
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:45 Because i dont like using it
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:34:15 Sure, ill build a plane with motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:34:22 But not now
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:35:21 I never use tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:36:08 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:36:13 I looked at the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:36:18 I didnt watch the video0
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:36:40 but i didnt use a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:38:40 I know how motor lock works
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:38:45 I CAN use motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:38:52 I just dont like to go through the trouble
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:40:09 Except half of your build is going to be up in the sky
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:41:39 I dont make military jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:42:01 a330
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:42:58 true
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:43:31 but my next plane is gonna be a martin m130
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:44:26 nicht danke
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:44:51 which part?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:45:24 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:46:34 no, i was gonna make it 3 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:47:03 that could be a poeblem
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:47:16 how  you know how wide it is
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:47:38 there is
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:52:55 Just had to go beat up the motor lock poster i have in my garage
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:02:23 Too much motor lock for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:02:28 Make it in like Stomworks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:03:04 but its like plane crazy but with round objects and physics
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:03:23 I beleive in being good at a game without glitches
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:04:09 But it glitches the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:04:21 Your machine has like 11 blocks in 1 blocks space
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:04:42 that wheel thingymajig on the side has like 50 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:04:53 Show before all of the locks combine
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:05:12 says the guy who cant build a flying boat even with motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:05:32 Except they dont look nice before you start it
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:07 Its almost impossible to do like folding
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:36 If you build a plane, and then another part of the plane like 15 blocks up
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:06:54 it is difficult to fold the part that is 15 blocks up
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:07:29 I also think motor lock is unnecacary for making large flying boats
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:07:35 Which is basically the only thing i do
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:07:55 Not if i need that much motor lock or like 50 hoover engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:09:11 But they dont
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:09:24 I dont have enough free time for that build
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:09:40 Master player may have literally no activites and lives in his room
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:07 In discord
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:10 I know him IRL
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:28 He is bad at everything except boats and fighter jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:37 Have you seen his disgusting airliner
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:47 Well i dont play 2 hours a day
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:10:51 More like 1
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:11:08 And that hindenburg took a lot more than that
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:11:12 Zeppelin*
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:12:49 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:13:01 I have only 1 build based on a real plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:13:33 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:13:58 Living room
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:14:05 No pun intended
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:14:35 No, i just go from a single picture
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:15:01 While master will throw hours at a time on his planes, i usually play RDR2 a lot more
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:15:17 It is the size of a 737, with gear like an An-225
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:15:26 Master cant make realistic gear at all
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:15:51 Right, remeber thats a 40-50 hour story
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:16:23 I just dont care to spend the time making something so complex, and then flying around for 30 mins and then be done
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:23:23 I read an intresting statistic that i cannor confirm, but it claimed that 65% of discord users in my country were below the age of 13
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:28:55 Who has that much free time?
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:30:15 I know, but the time it takes to actually place all of that motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:32:29 You sure? I tried making my boat that detailed, but its so time consuming placing every single block, spawning, waiting for the lag to end, and checking if it looks good
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:34:32 That i know, but its the small details that are time consuming
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:34:53 also, its really difficult to make a military jet look good without at least some motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:38:48 Can anyone tell me what the "Impact speed" on an explosive block changes?
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:39:08 My friend is telling me it changes the speed that the block explodes, but that doesnt make sense
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:23 Thanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:41:31 Ok please clarify that it DOES NOT change the speed at which the block explodes
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:42:31 Ok, good, thanks for the clarification, my friend didnt want to stop arguing
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:43:16 Not sure its that important
