plane-crazy 2019-09-30 01:55:42 Anyone made a plane with rotating wings?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 01:55:56 Did it work?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 01:56:24 Your main wingset on an actual plane, but the wings rotate
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 01:57:07 Can't remmeber. I edited it, made the wings on the bottom side of the aircraft so it flew better
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 01:57:22 Think it was on the a axis

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:13:27 <@505835349889777685> Your boat floats like that because of the water physics. Your boat is also quite thin meaning slight movements will tilt it with that roof, which is top-heavy. Pontoons won't make much difference unless they are at the surface and quite far out.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:14:26 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:14:48 Yeah, the plots need to be somewhat longer.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:15:01 The roof doesn't help
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:15:21 Oh

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:17:38 Can you make guns with the explosive blocks/balls?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:17:56 I need to watch how.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:20:58 ^
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:21:05 Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:21:38 I remember when I was beginning to play and this one guy had a real big boat.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:21:54 It was real low in the waters so I shot him with my guns.
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:22:02 Then,
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:23:05 He hits flip, and then must have disconnected ropes with ballast on them, and this whole row of explosive ball cannons come from under the ship's surface
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:23:21 And I was like
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:23:28 ## ####

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:13:25 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:13:31 It's about the battleships
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:13:45 I'm gonna say it anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:13:48 Cause it epci
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:15:37 Most ships had at least 3-4 turrets. The always faced in the same direction, aiming for the enemy as a whole. Funny thing, is that the enemy had to keep the ammo somewhere.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:16:11 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:16:20 Gotta be careful though
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:16:36 Cause you never know where the ammunition would shoot to
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:17:19 Anyone currently playing?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:17:33 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 00:17:58 I'm gonna work on these guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:00:22 Magnet cannons weighed far to much
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:00:27 Took to long
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:00:41 So I went big brain, and used springs
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:01:33 Except, you turn them around the opposite way, and put a piston at the edge of where it goes, so it doesnt fly off that triggers as you enable the spring.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:01:44 Gives it twice as much force
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:07:23 Still looks nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:27:07 They need to add battleship guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:27:17 Would be nicer
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:27:24 And thanks would also be real as well
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:56:44 Really want artillery parts now lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:56:50 It would be so much easier

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:20:12 Got one
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:21:02 Place all your guns under the surface of the boat, and use ballast tanks to rise it, and to the horror of your enemies, they see a full scale set of cannons staring at them.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:21:18 Guns under the boat
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:22:15 <@168154760866693120> Place all your guns under the surface of the boat, and use ballast tanks to rise it, and to the horror of your enemies, they see a full scale set of cannons staring at them.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:24:19 What kind of ideas do you want?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:26 you could make what modern Navy ships have, those missile hatches, and launch those at the enemy
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:56 They do have those
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:11 Just watch a few clips on YouTube
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:35 Pretty much what mine is lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:27:22 I have 2 versions of mine: destroyer and emergency response. Has this giant crane on it
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:57 Remember this saying: The more ontop, the further it sinks, the more underneath, the higher it floats.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:15 Good luck
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:22 Neither
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:57 Have torpedo launchers instead of guns on a ship, cause they take so long to make.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:30:51 I haven't, but I'm gonna try.

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:50 The guns I made are good for launching torpedos, but not actual explosive balls
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:34:04 Doesnt go far enough
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:34:26 And a railgun 40 blocks long won't fit on a gunship very well
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:35:43 Thermo rounds
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:35:51 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:36:20 All we need are guns that blow the shit out of other ships and we good.

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:00 That would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:52 They dont do that is the other craft is moving more than 20 tho
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:39:24 The missiles are a piece of shit and only track when they are 5 blocks away from the enemy

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:06:20 Make a section at the back that can pick up small boats like they have on research ships.
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:06:32 And Navy boats
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:06:59 Gonna use heaps of your storage data
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:08:00 Gotta be careful, cause how are you gonna get the middle section to connect when it's that big.
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:08:19 2 blocks away from the edge
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:08:33 I somehow think that's gonna be to big to fit
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:16:14 What
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:16:16 The hell
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:16:25 VIP servers can do that?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:33:06 Every though it's because the turrets are placed on the other pieces
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:33:13 You've stuck then together
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:33:20 The motors dont work like that
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:33:24 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:37:24 Re place the motors
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:37:37 Or, make the entire a block higher
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:37:50 Try it
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:39:17 F
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 07:44:24 Why dont you make the turret a block higher?

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 03:32:10 Or just use ballast tanks to make it float

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:01:31 ^exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:01:39 You gotta be head on to fire them
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:01:48 And that's a death wish in itself
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:02:14 Much more vulnerable however
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:02:30 Modern ships have their own targeting systems
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:02:42 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:03:12 Technology is to advanced to have some high powered launcher on pantoons
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:04:21 What people dont understand, is the fact that all you need is one explosive round to hit one of those launchers, and the boat's crew cease to exist
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:04:41 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:05:10 Death wish, especially on a boat when you got 12, 15 inch cannons facing you
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:05:28 It's suicide
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:05:50 There's one thing that ensures death for everyone on that boat
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:06:13 ^^^
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:06:49 Noc is correct. As soon as they finish testing the railgun, hell will break loose
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:07:11 They could pierce through minimum 3 ships with one round
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:07:38 <@310863132727836672> there are currently submarines powered by Nuclear generators
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:08:10 And with that weapon, it only takes 5 shots to take out a large fleet is you line it up right.
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:08:42 No such thing as batteries for that
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:08:50 They would explode
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:08:54 ^^
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:09:28 Nuclear is surprisingly the cleanest way to make electricity
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:09:52 Anything is unsafe when not maintained
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:10:40 I like how this guy is arguing about technology
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:10:49 Here's my main point
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:11:26 Why the fuck would the Navy be testing railguns if they wouldn't be able to use them on a Gid damned vessel?
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:11:40 They wouldn't
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:11:46 Oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:12:11 <@456226577798135808> how did you make those?

plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:32:14 Any updates on the new map yet?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:29 Yup
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:34 It lags enough already
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:34:04 True
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:34:25 You can use heaps of blocks without realizing
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:35:33 Well, now we know that people are gonna make giant ocean sub-stations
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:07 True
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:27 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:59 I feel worse for those with separate engine VTOLS that flip their craft as soon as the front engine hit the island
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:37:48 Currently, you can't do much with custom stuff cause it doesn't fit on anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:02 Honestly, who makes square stuff? Build plots should be more rectangular I believe.
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:35 Anyone else's parachutes start spazzing out when they're slowing down?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:41:14 I was testing bomb, and I had one that allow a more direct hit

plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:42:37 Nothing wrong with the current map. There's just no road
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:42:55 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:43:00 That would be helpful
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:44:00 Rather metres that tell you how much weight you have, and how much thrust you have
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:44:31 So VTOLs don't send you 20,000 feet into the air when you're trying to gain control
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:45:07 <@318593948081848320> do I spy flying wheelchair?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:46:16 The only stuff that works as intended is a plane like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:46:48 Jesus
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:47:46 I wonder if anyone has yet realised that you could make a sky elevator with hoverpads
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:51:26 Honestly, I should start making stuff that will actually fly
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 08:03:09 Cause if they make something for you, you cannot use it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 08:03:32 It won't work
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 08:03:43 Cause the game doesn't let you

general 2020-04-19 07:43:59 You shouldn't use pistons on a helicopter rotor...
general 2020-04-19 07:44:47 Cause the lift is what spazes them

general 2020-04-19 07:47:39 The bottom of the motor for the spin
general 2020-04-19 07:47:53 Is it solid fixed to the helicopter?
general 2020-04-19 07:48:14 Swashplate?
general 2020-04-19 07:48:18 Ah
general 2020-04-19 07:48:31 You can't make them that small
general 2020-04-19 07:50:18 They cant be a realistic size because of the block sizes
general 2020-04-19 07:50:21 I tried myself
general 2020-04-19 07:51:17 Yeah

plane-crazy 2020-04-24 08:33:42 Dark and medium should do  <@287459677611098114>

creations-chat 2020-05-06 05:14:18 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:58:14 He means the burst
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:58:26 The fire burst out of the chamber
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:58:50 The looks pretty realistic btw
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:59:02 Only thing I would fix, is how fast the recoil is
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:59:28 I'm meaning
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:59:38 When it comes back up
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:59:44 When it resets
creations-chat 2020-05-07 08:59:51 It needs to he slower
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:00:15 I assume you used a spring for it?
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:00:29 Ik how to fix it then
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:00:36 If you use 2 springs and suspension
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:00:56 One spring is on auto retract the other isn't
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:01:04 That'll make the reset slower
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:01:24 I've gotta make one of them, I just suck at designing lol
creations-chat 2020-05-07 09:02:13 Also, if the suspension is on max length, but its really soft, that'll help with how quick it comes back
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:43:12 -mapsuggest Map-wide railway tracks. It's not hard to add, but remember to make sure the curves aren't too tight, overwise they fly off the rails and can't go around the corners.
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 06:53:19 Who knows the best way to shoot projectiles now?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 06:53:33 Sweet

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 01:01:41 Is there a way to make guided rockets?

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 05:36:41 Are ICBM submarines still popular here?
