general 2019-12-06 08:45:58 I kinda accept the challenge for stopping a plane at 200 sps
general 2019-12-06 08:46:36 The only concerns will be block glitching and stability of the carrier itself

general 2019-12-06 08:53:24 If springs/suspension had increased stability, making arresting wires will be rather ez
general 2019-12-06 08:53:42 Wait omg i know how to make it
general 2019-12-06 08:54:08 Add magnets to the suspension block so they repel each other
general 2019-12-06 08:54:27 And give it more uh... stopping force?

help 2020-05-26 02:58:07 <@!481830071607361536> i am assuming that the sideways movement is cuz of the resultant counter-clockwise motion from the main rotor, and the clockwise motion from the tail rotors, on the body.
help 2020-05-26 02:59:10 so you can like try to maybe tilt your main rotor towards the right side?
help 2020-05-26 02:59:37 idk cuz irl, heli's have their main rotors tilted as well
help 2020-05-26 02:59:47 so it may be the problem here

creations-chat 2020-05-26 03:06:48 my theory is that if they for say make two ping pong balls
creations-chat 2020-05-26 03:06:53 one bigger than the other
creations-chat 2020-05-26 03:07:02 one anti matter and one matter
creations-chat 2020-05-26 03:07:39 they could theoretically use the pulling force and keep the anti matter suspended within the bigger ball
creations-chat 2020-05-26 03:07:48 oh and it has to be vacuumed

bot-central 2020-05-26 15:23:12 check for the requirements
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:23:50 np
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:24:11 i am looking into making even more designs :P
general 2020-05-27 01:26:10 <@!367842191613362178> devs already said that resizing the size of plots would require them to basically recode the entire game
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:26:39 that seems fairly simple
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:27:13 for the gun you could motor lock 2 rows of 5 guns together
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:27:32 and have one row motor locked .05 backwards
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:27:38 .5*
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:27:55 so you get a nice barrel look without gaps
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:28:17 -_-
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:31:19 yeah
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:31:24 it's a part of the game now
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:31:36 and a really good part
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:32:15 like have you seen this beauty?
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:33:29 thing can hit 1K speed and can maneuver like a god
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:33:43 oh and 34 kills >:3
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:42:34 <@!360770826884087818> yeah that is literally the most inaccurate paintjob around
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:44:25 it's orange tipped, not orange lined
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:44:56 and the vertical stabalisers are supposed to be white and orange
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:53:18 <@!360770826884087818> never dishonour ace combat
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:54:19 and you make a joke out of mihaly's signature paintjob
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:54:26 how dare you
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:58:24 okay back
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:58:30 AS I WAS SAYING
creations-chat 2020-05-27 08:58:49 IT'S ORANGE TIPPED
creations-chat 2020-05-27 09:00:02 actually come to think of it
creations-chat 2020-05-27 09:00:20 it's somewhere inbetween orange and maroon
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:50:20 imma be real, only one looks like an f35
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:52:02 one looks like an f4 phantom, one is honestly just a bigger starter plane, and one looks like a disfigured f15
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:53:10 actually screw it none of them really look like f35's
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:55:21 black one with blue canopy is "bigger starter plane"
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:55:57 bottom left in second image is disfigured f15
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:56:45 dark gray one at the top in third image is the one i feel looks decent, until i saw it from the top
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:57:43 and the one in the center of every image is the "f4 phantom"
creations-chat 2020-05-27 10:59:30 cockpit of decent looking one is great, but the body and wings need a ton of work
creations-chat 2020-05-27 11:00:18 cockpit of disfigured f15 is too slim, and the length of the primary wings on the x axis is too short
creations-chat 2020-05-27 11:02:20 canopy of f4 phantom is too short in terms of height, and the intakes are pretty chonky (either the paintjob or the angle idk)
creations-chat 2020-05-27 11:02:42 and big starter plane is just trash
creations-chat 2020-05-27 11:02:59 wait

creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:12:15 bruh when you go for a attack run, you just quickly fire a volley of bullets, you get a good idea of where the nose of your jet is facing, you fire your rockets, then get out as fast as you can
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:12:33 > To hit you while strafing a ground AA can just spam rockets in the air until you get hit.
<@!323414243074506763> i fly faster than rockets

creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:13:48 which is why you have to move faster than your opponent can react

creations-chat 2020-06-08 04:15:03 People who say "downvoting things they can't build" are kinda fucking stupid... You downvote not because it is better than your builds and you feel salt or whatever, you downvote cuz in your opinion, you find it not worth the upvote. (Also if you downvote cuz u r salt, go fuck yourself)
creations-chat 2020-06-08 04:16:45 Greeninja

creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:08:42 Weird question
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:09:46 So you are saying that having a high status means you have the right to speak your mind? And if you don't then you can't?

creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:12:45 Looks very medieval
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:12:59 But wait
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:13:10 That build was posted before outlines were removed

creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:18:04 Cyall
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:37:16 Y'all must have some really bad aim to do that little damage to each other. Understandable for the plane that is filled with rocket engines for some reason, but damn if you got a turret with guns and you have a target travelling at what I assume would be 400sps, you should be able to shoot it down on its second strafe run
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:42:31 I just said he had bad aim
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:42:42 Is that not appropriate?
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:56:50 > he did a pretty god job at leading those shots
<@582834773773254656> don't have to lead shit when firing at a strafing aircraft
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:59:36 Why would you lead your shots at a strafing aircraft
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:59:43 S t r a f I N g
creations-chat 2020-06-08 06:59:53 Do u know what that iiiis?
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:00:42 Leading is to fire at a predetermined area to hit a moving target
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:00:48 Does not really apply
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:00:54 When the damn thing
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:01:01 IS FLYING RIGHT AT YOU
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:01:24 A r g o o m e n
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:01:33 Keybinds would be hellish
creations-chat 2020-06-08 07:01:50 And I would applaud him if that were the case

general 2020-06-19 10:51:07 as said in the poll

general 2020-06-19 13:59:22 spent two days trying to figure out basic tools
general 2020-06-19 13:59:28 gave up in the end
general 2020-06-19 14:32:47 <@456226577798135808> mouse controlled builds, move towards where your mouse is pointed, and if your POV is fixed with said build, it would obviously go wrong
general 2020-06-19 14:33:11 <@456226577798135808> for example you have a line of colours like the rainbow
general 2020-06-19 14:33:22 you are by default aiming at red
general 2020-06-19 14:33:29 you move your mouse to point at orange
general 2020-06-19 14:33:57 this turns your camera to look at the orange, and in turn moving your mouse to look at yellow
general 2020-06-19 14:35:19 <@!389756407483990028> look in <#507673335816126509>
general 2020-06-19 14:35:40 the dude was complaining bout how cameras on motor 2 builds get funky
general 2020-06-19 14:35:51 clearly has zero common sense

general 2020-06-21 14:28:57 <@!479298992874979328> suggestion is pretty good, considering we would be able to have more realistic aerial manuevers such as pugachev's cobra, and having more immersive dogfights, considering the fact that it would take a larger amount of effort to flank enemies

creations-chat 2020-06-24 09:05:00 Also the medium that provides lost thrust is suspension, and the most stable is using an unpowered motor
creations-chat 2020-06-24 09:05:05 Most*
creations-chat 2020-06-24 09:07:35 Oh also suspension is most unstable, depending on configurations, followed by parachute, then piston, then landing gears, then motors
creations-chat 2020-06-24 09:07:58 And never use trapdoors as the medium

general 2020-07-07 07:08:50 "Making a new map would be amazing, a winter biom, desert biom, grasslands biom, and  a rocky - mountain biom, this will give us more area and obstacles to face, leading us to build new technology leading to us having more ideas and gaining creativity and knowledge, it would also be AMAZING if there was relaxing music in each of the biomes and special effects like snow in the mountain - rocky biomes, dust and sand particles in the desert, tall moving grass for the grass biom, and in the winter biom, a downpour of snow. all of the maps could have AMAZING lighting enabling nostalgia and other amazing features for the game."

general 2020-07-09 15:35:39 simpleplanes is like
general 2020-07-09 15:35:42 funky
general 2020-07-09 15:35:57 the physics is good and bad at the same time
general 2020-07-09 15:36:24 lol
general 2020-07-09 15:36:32 it's pretty affordable

general 2020-07-09 15:37:09 lmao
general 2020-07-09 15:37:15 eat shit fall off your horse
general 2020-07-09 15:38:04 i recommend getting KSP instead of simpleplanes if you are going fot the physics
general 2020-07-09 15:38:17 but if you want aesthetics then get simpleplanes
general 2020-07-09 15:38:29 and if you want both, just get KSP with like 20 mods
general 2020-07-09 15:38:38 lol
general 2020-07-09 15:38:45 get rescale
general 2020-07-09 15:38:47 it's the best

<@!434870263088152577> with rescale you can build a completely custom one
general 2020-07-09 15:43:27 yes
general 2020-07-09 15:43:28 :/
general 2020-07-09 15:43:52 you can rescale for say rotators, and panels, to build a custom droop snoot
general 2020-07-09 15:44:01 of your desired size

creations-chat 2020-07-25 10:58:56 all heli builders
creations-chat 2020-07-25 10:59:05 look in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-07-25 10:59:10 most useful thing ever
creations-chat 2020-07-25 10:59:12 >:3
creations-chat 2020-07-25 10:59:44 i can just lower the speed :P
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:02:45 UHHHHHHH
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:02:50 SOMETHING HAPPENED XD
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:02:55 https://streamable.com/tcdtg2
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:07 IT'S ACTING LIKE A SWASHPLATE
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:13 WHY
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:33 the swashplate effect?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:36 idk
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:43 the counter rotator
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:03:54 just stack two motors
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:04:00 one locked and one powered
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:04:10 and attach a suspension block next to it
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:05:05 the rotational force of the motor is placed upon the suspension block, which stops it from rotating on one axis, but in turn is rotated in another
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:06:34 you know what a bevel gear is?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:07:51 so you know right?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:08:08 basically in this case, one gear is rotating while the other is locked
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:08:34 this causes tensional force on the side opposite of the direction of rotation
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:09:22 which in turn rotates the entire thing according to the direction of the "locked gear"
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:09:28 which is the suspension block
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:09:45 OHHHH WAIT SOMEONE I KNOW REALLY NEEDS THIS
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:09:51 <@!670939038999511041>
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:00 the counter rotator
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:01 lol
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:14 the top motor is the power source
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:22 the locked motor is um
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:29 idk if it has to be locked or not but it's there
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:10:49 and the suspension is what converts the rotation
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:11:00 yes hi
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:11:06 wait wrong one
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:11:08 mb

creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:11:35 yeap
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:11:52 indeed
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:12:03 sure thing bud
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:12:47 btw i am trying to stabalise it so it is not fully reliable as of yet
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:29:43 https://streamable.com/tcdtg2
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:30:38 which is why finding out the cause could allow it to be altered
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:30:48 we need experts for this
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:30:59 i do not know my dude
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:31:20 it was a random phenomenon that occured while i was using the counter rotator
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:31:27 sakura uses scripts lol
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:31:30 oh yeahhhhhhh
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:31:39 yeap
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:31:54 https://streamable.com/pnqkk6
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:33:15 oh those?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:33:27 just use the move tool and move your build forward then back
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:33:34 it fixes it instantly
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:35:15 stabilised it https://streamable.com/pwee69
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:36:23 <@!693476997007147068> just flip it so the sharp end it facing the top, place it one block to the side, then rotate it back and place it on using the first wedge  placed
creations-chat 2020-07-25 11:36:33 wait lemme give you an example

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 13:07:42 M107 shotgun is god
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:08:11 is your heli already built with a counter rotator?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:08:15 <@!495210490172014612>
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:08:38 like a tail rotor or a second set of propellors?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:09:39 <@456226577798135808> show me how it walks without those rocket thrusters
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:09:56 cuz from the looks of it, it would simply wobble around
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:16:03 <@!495210490172014612> do not add it
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:16:11 join my server
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:21:15 first off, they are slanted outward too much, and second, you may wanna use fabric blocks on the tips to increase friction
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:23:26 the tail would add excess counter rotation to the already existing counter rotator module
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:23:55 so you may want to keep it neutral
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:24:08 kk i gotta hop off
creations-chat 2020-07-25 13:24:10 cya
creations-chat 2020-07-25 14:15:20 <@!495210490172014612> you are connecting the counter rotator to the body by the locked motor, when you should be connecting it by the top part of the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 14:15:54 <@!199720559557214208> yeah sure i don't mind :P
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 14:16:16 i do this stuff so people have simpler alternatives :)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 14:17:59 ping me if you have any issues with the module
creations-chat 2020-07-25 14:23:25 uh no
creations-chat 2020-07-25 14:23:44 you have to reattach it by the top half of the suspension
creations-chat 2020-07-25 14:24:17 it's a really weird requirement for the design but eh :/
creations-chat 2020-07-25 14:27:25 <@!495210490172014612>
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 14:31:55 > no i dont see it

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:26:54 i just got logged out saying same account logged on from different device
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:27:02 so i changed my password
creations-chat 2020-07-26 05:53:20 https://streamable.com/197stx i have done it
creations-chat 2020-07-26 05:56:33 and now a problem arises https://streamable.com/3rojf5
creations-chat 2020-07-26 06:02:06 <@!495210490172014612> do not use the counter rotator
creations-chat 2020-07-26 06:02:41 i will try to find a solution for this
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 06:12:13 anyone willing to help find a solution for this problem?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 06:12:14 https://streamable.com/3rojf5
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 06:16:02 from what i know, the rotation produced by the coriolis effect from the porpellors is being forced into the suspension, which is then forced onto the motors on both ends that cancels out the rotation completely
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 06:16:30 this thing https://streamable.com/3rojf5
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 06:18:15 but due to the fact that the rotators take linear and rotational force in both directions, and cancels out linear force on the suspension means that applying it on a heli would restrict it from turning conventionally
creations-chat 2020-07-26 07:35:23 it cancels out rotation from external sources
creations-chat 2020-07-26 07:35:48 and the only rotation it allows to get through is its own
creations-chat 2020-07-26 07:36:15 but that's not possible as its own rotation is being cancelled out by the propellors
creations-chat 2020-07-26 07:37:18 so it either stabilises and stops the build form rotating, or the rotation clash glitches it out
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:29:42 <@!495210490172014612> okay i found a really dumb but functional alternative
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:29:48 it complicates it more tho
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:30:26 so this is what the mechanism looks like now
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:30:36 and i shall now build a custom attack heli with it
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:30:44 yeap
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:30:48 super complicated stuff
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:30:54 for me that is
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:31:20 i shall now scratch that idea
creations-chat 2020-07-26 08:31:24 i will make an apache again

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:37:41 I went over to their plots
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:38:01 Their "swashplates" were rocket thrusters and propellor engine tails
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:38:21 No tilting of propellors whatsoever
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:38:52 I left
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:38:58 Too much toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:39:05 Plus I gotta sleep
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:39:21 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:39:37 They even had fine meshers on the propellors? And they did nothing
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:39:51 Like... Along the blade
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:40:08 And the Heli looked like a thin sausage
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:40:25 So many things I can point out that pisses me off
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:41:57 Oh and they were the kind of people that were to insult people personally in arguements that did not concern the state and or well being of opposing party's

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:39:22 I INVENTED THE COUNTER ROTATOR
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:39:37 WHERE TF THEM MODS AT
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:40:12 <@370594904268734464>

general 2020-07-27 07:44:40 I'll try to find out
general 2020-07-27 07:46:54 All I found was the dimensions of the rocket as a whole
general 2020-07-27 07:47:12 45.6m (height)
general 2020-07-27 07:47:20 10.3m (diameter)
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:47:47 Ya boi brickzay
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:48:12 Well not directly obviously
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:48:25 But I did invent this gizmo thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:48:28 Gimme a sec
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:48:57 https://streamable.com/ny7zbl
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:49:05 It's not a swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:49:34 It basically converts the entire build welded directly into the small bit of the motor block
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:49:51 So more of an amplifier in a way?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:50:16 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:50:37 https://streamable.com/31hvvl
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:51:12 Hm?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:51:32 Yos
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:51:37 Buuttttt
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:51:41 Big problem it has
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:51:53 Is that any external rotational forces applied
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:52:00 Are cancelled out
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:52:09 Like almost completely
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:52:27 Near impossible to turn the stable variant
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:53:55 Hello
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:53:57 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:53:58 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:54:40 Should I ping yousuf again
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:54:42 :3
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:55:28 Stfu
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:55:32 Pls
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:55:42 The brrr meme is overused
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:16 <@335599526414909451> am I qualified for the inventor rank for inventing a small little gizmo that converts directly welded builds into the small part of a motor block?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:25 Thar we go
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:32 P I n g
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:43 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:50 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:51 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:04 It would not register
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:19 You would simply have your character erased
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:31 Give me a second
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:36 Brb
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:01:23 Speed of light in roblox with reference to actual ratio is 5.99584916e9s/s
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:01:53 Yeap
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:02:01 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:02:02 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:02:11 It goes by studs per second
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:02:57 So we simply take (speed of light)(20)
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:19 Since speed of light is in meters and 1 meter = 20studs
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:34 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:57 1 stud = 2cm
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:04:51 In proportion to meters or in proportion to the average human compared to a robloxian
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:05:04 Hi hyper

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:08:55 > could even replace it with a normal block
Didn't work when I did that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:09:33 It simply starts to wobble when I do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:09:42 Doesn't rotate
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:10:03 Wait when the hell was this even made
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:13:43 Having an indirectly welded block be the medium for conversion or amplification for a power source
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:13:46 I see
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:13:48 BUT
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:14:10 Has anyone built it in such a way that it is able to cancel out rotation?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:14:21 >:3
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:14:33 I swear I will fucking argue till I die

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:25:24 I would like to say that the "engine" I made beats literally every other engine in terms of power
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:25:39 Even the conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:45:34 Bigger question is why huge jet engines can't lift their own weight

general 2020-09-12 09:09:24 people should invent a shell built for the sole purpose of blowing the turrets off tanks
general 2020-09-12 09:09:48 but it gonna need a shit ton of force and stopping force :/
general 2020-09-12 09:10:06 or velocity and stopping power :)

general 2020-09-12 09:11:20 would be completely useless XD

general 2020-09-13 07:31:13 2020 years ago
general 2020-09-14 08:24:52 I have done the math
general 2020-09-14 08:26:14 If you were to  scale down humans to roblox proportions, with an average human being 1.7m, and a robloxian 5 studs, Mach speed in roblox would be 1008s/s
general 2020-09-14 08:26:24 >:3
general 2020-09-14 08:26:35 My drones fly at Mach speed >:3
general 2020-09-14 08:26:41 Yos
general 2020-09-14 08:26:59 Brb
general 2020-09-14 08:26:59 Sure thing
general 2020-09-14 08:28:29 881,742,523s/s
general 2020-09-14 08:28:41 Speed of light converted to roblox proportions
general 2020-09-14 08:28:49 Uh no
general 2020-09-14 08:28:55 That's if you use human proportions
general 2020-09-14 08:29:05 Now we are scaling up roblox proportions
general 2020-09-14 08:29:22 Noooo
general 2020-09-14 08:29:25 I am saying
general 2020-09-14 08:29:28 What if
general 2020-09-14 08:29:33 You scaled robloxians
general 2020-09-14 08:29:37 Up to human size
general 2020-09-14 08:29:43 Shuejfbsvajkd
general 2020-09-14 08:29:47 EEEEE
general 2020-09-14 08:30:03 Yeap
general 2020-09-14 08:30:33 But yeah Mach 1 is 1008s/s and light speed is 881,742,523s/s
general 2020-09-14 08:30:47 If you used scaled up proportions ofc
general 2020-09-14 08:30:55 Me?
general 2020-09-14 08:30:57 No
general 2020-09-14 08:31:08 Cuz someone asked

general 2020-09-14 08:33:22 2971s/s
general 2020-09-14 08:34:06 > 2971s/s
GAU-8 Avenger muzzle velocity scaled down to roblox proportions
general 2020-09-14 08:34:38 Light speed using relative scaling would be uhhh
general 2020-09-14 08:35:33 5.99584916e9s/s light speed using relative scaling :/
general 2020-09-14 08:35:39 B o o
general 2020-09-14 08:37:58 <@447221768520859659> that's why we don't use relative scaling
general 2020-09-14 08:38:12 We just scale ourselves up to human size
general 2020-09-14 08:38:15 And boom
general 2020-09-14 08:38:21 Mach speed like it's nothing
general 2020-09-14 08:38:31 Lmao

general 2020-09-16 08:04:23 I have only seen it once by Yousuf lol

general 2020-09-16 08:05:25 So instead of 1s^3
general 2020-09-16 08:05:34 We got 0.5s^3

creations-chat 2020-09-16 13:21:50 exactly
creations-chat 2020-09-16 13:21:54 there was effort

creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:15:41 yes please
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:30:09 Have y'all maybe considered center of mass?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:30:56 Keep COM low and have a wider base if possible
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:31:25 And if anything goes wrong
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:31:32 Use ballast base and helium top
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:32:08 Increase drag if you don't want as much sliding
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:06 Fun fact
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:24 3K SPS isn't even Mach 0.5 if using relative scaling
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:34 :)
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:40 Yeap
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:34:03 Okay if we scaled robloxians up to human size
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:34:17 Mach speed would be about 1005 s/s
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:34:37 But if we go with relative scaling then Mach 1 is like 6.8K s/s
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:35:09 What for
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:35:30 Speed just affects rate of height increase/decrease
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:36:21 I would recommend motor locking a V-shape hover for bikes for increased stability
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:36:38 Uh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:36:46 6800(3)
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:36:50 So uh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:37:07 20400sps
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:37:11 I think
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:37:29 Lol
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:38:18 > so that's faster than Mach 3?
<@572411935669354528> Mach 3 with relative scaling is 20400 sps
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:38:40 Oh wait okay my bad
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:38:46 I read that wrong
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:39:04 Yeah and uh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:39:11 Using scaled up proportions
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:39:22 You'd be past hypersonic speeds
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:39:32 Mach 28

<@516385356006817792>
general 2020-09-18 08:42:45 Using scaled up proportions

general 2020-09-18 08:45:02 It's just a room
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:57:22 > it would have to be 23800?
<@572411935669354528> General Mach speed is 343m/s  and 1m = 20 studs so 343(20) = 6860s/s and 6860(3.2) = 21952s/s  to achieve Mach 3.2
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:04:05 Maybe motor lock it into the ship itself so it doesn't just poke out?<@714763671410180127>

creations-chat 2020-09-22 02:27:05 > What the fuck is "Love"?
<@!714763671410180127> i would say a mutual understanding, and acceptance toward each other between two parties
creations-chat 2020-09-22 02:27:40 > love is dopamine, norepinephrine and phenylethylamine
and serotonin >:3

creations-chat 2020-09-23 04:27:20 It's called a shock cone not a ramjet spike
creations-chat 2020-09-23 04:28:44 And an afterburning turbojet engine comprises of compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and fuel injector (for afterburners)
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:17:57 -mapsuggest have the underside of the new map fitted with long ass pillars? (Like really thicc stalactites) It would really add more variety to dogfights and PvP in general :)

creations-chat 2020-10-04 06:03:29 <@!727146172447195157> you motor locked a motor into a block. big deal :/
creations-chat 2020-10-04 06:05:09 a shame that people even think that's worth an upvote

general 2020-10-09 04:22:48 Stupid display driver being outdated and unable to be updated

creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:51:49 <@!661550706511314944> you got designer IV, that's 49 upvotes max, and the reference pic has 51 not counting the downvotes... so you are in no position to speak either
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:55:15 since when does "so you are in no position to speak either" mean i'm salty... and also you're not supposed to post reference pics
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:58:25 let's be honest that doesn't matter since the downvotes already outweigh the upvotes by a ton

creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:17:44 That's not what downvotes are for....
creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:25:00 <@683847069890510887> so you just gonna downvote the creations of all the other people that downvoted your builds?
creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:28:18 So you're revenge downvoting specifically me... Because I was honest?

general 2022-01-17 12:17:50 i just rejoined today
general 2022-01-17 12:18:07 to work on the suspension-based gyro
general 2022-01-17 12:18:11 a y e
general 2022-01-17 12:18:15 s a m e
general 2022-01-17 12:18:32 e
general 2022-01-17 12:18:49 wait nani
general 2022-01-17 12:19:28 the medium's rate of reciprocation is directly proportional to the shaft's RPM?
general 2022-01-17 12:19:52 😳
general 2022-01-17 12:20:19 the mediums for the hovers to act on
general 2022-01-17 12:20:44 satisfying
general 2022-01-17 12:20:51 but also a little painful to process
general 2022-01-17 12:23:44 ahhhhh beautiful
general 2022-01-17 12:24:29 without locking?
general 2022-01-17 12:24:42 h u h
general 2022-01-17 12:24:55 doesn't seem possible but i guess it is
general 2022-01-17 12:25:17 anyways, i finally stabilised the gyro
general 2022-01-17 12:25:28 swapped the suspensions out for springs
general 2022-01-17 12:25:38 more compact and more controllable
general 2022-01-17 12:27:13 https://streamable.com/v6u5fj
