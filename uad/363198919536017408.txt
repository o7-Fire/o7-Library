plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:55:23 hello
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:58:08 has anyone ever made angled wings in the game?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:58:34 https://gyazo.com/f3aceb6842eaa1f34b70056af350d363 https://gyazo.com/627a0ed6bf4607b5173f509cded33f2e
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:58:40 i built a Ju-87 in game
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:58:51 because if not, i could be the first to make angled wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:59:15 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:59:22 there we go
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 11:59:30 in game?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:00:05 coolio
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:00:20 so far i've only built 2 planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:01:18 that i can agree with
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:01:26 https://gyazo.com/51c9fc8520d22ea20f51cb8fe478c2c4
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:01:29 here's my first plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:01:36 Bf-109
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:02:31 i think propellers are too weak
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:02:45 a single propeller engine alone cant pull an aircraft at a good speed
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:04:55 the aerodynamics on the game though
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:05:16 i dont need a runway
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:05:20 i can takeoff in 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:17:48 https://gyazo.com/3ee8c3a7ed421ed5a52f28dee4dc0a76?token=537d79c149b61a0af7b1ac39f0808773
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:17:52 german boi on russian carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:17:56 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:21:15 i was able to take off successfuly, did a bombing run and was able to land back on the carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:44:26 https://gyazo.com/a4b6d625658f065d05bc1aac7ce38f41
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:44:30 i thought to myself
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:44:35 "why not make a ship isntead of a plane?"
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:45:52 https://gyazo.com/45595d4125d3e7ea2c5de7fb90ea8d43?token=e3d2260a9a6ef789a5d8c2337c0fbc8f
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:46:00 ~~it can also simulate titanic~~
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:58:06 when is pvp coming?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:58:56 isnt arena broken?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 12:59:04 i tried entering once, i jsut got redirected back to the main game
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:01:05 so, i should remove my helium blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:05:50 but the thing is
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:05:56 helium is what balances my plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:14:36 are blocks affected by the aerodynamics of the game?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:14:37 like
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:14:47 if i made a downward wedge for a plane hull
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:14:53 would it continously go down?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:14:54 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:28:58 lookin' good
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:28:59 https://gyazo.com/6ea3e9246b94e968281e0f9e333a4983
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:34:06 i just found out i can use pistons to lock the ship in place
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:34:20 by that i meant the piece of the ship that's rotated so that it fits in the building space
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:35:30 what should i use to steer the ship?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:35:40 nvm imma make a rudder
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:46:36 guys, what part weighs the most?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:49:22 didnt know you can edit the weight of the ballast
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 13:54:19 wait i can get ranked for replicating?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:20:05 update or just new thumbnail?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:38:08 rickje can we have bomb parts?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:38:16 like
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:38:18 i have a bomber
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:38:26 but the bomb does absoloutely nothing
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:39:12 tnt blocks i guess
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:41:11 try adding weights to the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:43:23 the super structure on my carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:43:28 looks absoloutely disgusting
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:43:34 https://gyazo.com/a083ca4902efd502c78361115e4e4e4b
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:43:36 how do i improve?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:43:46 wait i gotan idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:45:57 o hell
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:46:02 i want a cannon now
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:46:13 planes with cannons
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:46:16 absoloutely genius
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:53:26 i improved the superstructure a bit now
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:53:31 https://gyazo.com/28692178441c3cd58c42ccaa0742f9d8
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:55:05 ooh rickje
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:55:07 i have an idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:55:23 actually wait, idk if it can work or not
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:56:12 why?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 14:56:33 or no wait
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:03:58 best part about the game
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:04:07 the sound of the parts can be replaced by some random voice
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:05:19 that's me
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:05:22 then it did work
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:07:51 i still remember madattak bieng the reason i play robocraft
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:17:33 my carrier ended up at a whopping 957 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:17:38 imma detail this soon
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:19:40 lmao nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:24:35 oh rickje
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:24:43 i think i can use the reset motors on my carrier's turn system
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:27:08 it's obviously a boat
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:28:12 for a tall build, the carrier is very stable
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:40:35 ooh ooh rickje i have a good suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:42:03 i gtg
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 15:42:04 goodnight guys
help 2018-10-21 01:53:12 Pro tip, when making a plane, make the landing gear at the back slightly lifted so that the plane gets angled, which can help take off much easier
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 02:43:53 Were ballasts already ingame before helium got added?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 02:44:33 Dayumn, then that means i cant get in the arena
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 03:04:21 I should make a torpedo
bug-reports 2018-10-21 03:42:43 ya, my plane literally takes off in 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 06:01:53 my server is beyblade-free

plane-crazy 2018-10-21 06:11:13 i can just tear the flight deck off and i'll have the hull of a battleship
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:48:20 could you guys join me?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:48:23 im bored
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:48:39 i wants someone to land on my carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:49:08 due to propellers being weak af, here's my ships propulsion system
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:49:09 https://gyazo.com/2a15a907bd41959301a9b8ee2ba5a31b?token=d702fd75da80524fc669b8055616c005
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:49:31 my ship is literally longer than the box
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:50:17 wanna see how i got my ship longer than the box?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:50:52 https://gyazo.com/f1bd61a707d67604a71361f3aad6f500?token=c47ea95b6d24d6f56efe46cd5f17b30e
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:53:41 holy shit dude calm your tits
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:54:02 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:54:05 sorry
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 09:54:13 didn't know
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:05:14 honestly i thought height limit was pretty high
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:05:36 yeah i know, i read what you said
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:05:45 i guess
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:06:16 my ship's height doesnt even reach the height limit, even though it's elevated
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:06:34 you guys know about dis glorious game "warthunder?"
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:06:59 WoT is too arcadish
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:07:21 u can literally mount hte 88 of a tiger 2 on a tiger 1 in that game
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:07:26 i played WoTB first
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:07:38 but i switched to warthunder, im a guy who prefers realism
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:08:00 20 gigabytes
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:08:07 maps that are kilometers wide
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:08:31 WoT is fast paced, has smaller maps
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:08:49 well having a big map, makes the game a bit more challenging
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:00 try spotting a tank in a bush, around a kilometer away
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:05 like
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:07 you can see it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:14 you just have to know what you're looking at
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:23 i got paranoid because of that fact
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:29 literally any rock can look like a tank
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:09:58 then a tank can look like a rock
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:10:05 yeah a match in warthunder can reach 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:10:40 warthunder's tiers are more on the era rather than the power
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:10:54 like, hetzer wasnt an early war tank, and you can get it at tier 4 in WoT
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:11:14 Hetzer's my favorite
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:11:20 but u can see the differences in both games
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:11:29 WoTB's hetzer goes 35
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:11:41 in real life, and warthunder, they only go 20
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:11:43 on a flat surface that is
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:12:05 try matching an IS-2 and a tiger in warthunder
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:12:20 majority of encounters end up in the tiger getting obliterated
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:12:50 tho for tiger, at it's tier there's only 3 things to look out for
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:13:04 Fireflies, T-34-85's and is toos
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:13:12 yeah it only gets easier once you get the Panzer 4 F2
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:13:27 did you know the F2 is the single most OP tank ingame?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:13:45 br 3.3
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:14:07 the thing is, it's capable of competing in br 7.7
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:14:25 in WoTB, my highest tier tank is an E 75
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:14:45 i dont have WoT
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:14:47 only WoTB
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:14:57 like i said, i started in WoTB
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:15:04 then i discovered Wart thunder
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:15:20 summer
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:15:23 which was around
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:15:25 months ago
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:15:36 im only tier 3, my highest br tank is a 5.7 tiger H1
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:18:37 **WoT Elitists**
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:18:47 imma go play 1 match
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:18:52 i hope it goes well
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:19:13 WoT has a crapton more tanks
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:19:19 they even implemented Tiger 131
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:19:35 tiem to wart thunder
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:19:49 GuP panzer 4

plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:34:07 my ship is longer than the building space ingame
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:53:33 i just got an idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 10:53:48 imma see if i can make a working elevator on my carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 11:53:49 oh my god
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 11:53:51 i just realized
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 11:53:55 there's a corner wedge
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 13:46:49 Bombardier...
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 13:46:56 But my plane just carriers 1 big bomb
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 13:49:14 has anyone made a torpedo before?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 13:49:18 mine just flies out of the water
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 14:56:26 what's the most bouyant block in the game?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 14:59:43 nvm
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:05:46 I've made a seaplane
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:07:41 im so happy
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:07:46 my friend said it wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:07:56 because his seaplane cant take off of the water
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:08:21 https://gyazo.com/f0ef033a88323a7d9355b8938dcfa2dc
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:08:27 it goes at a whopping 110 too
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:09:25 it probably can fly
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 15:42:03 https://gyazo.com/97b2ddd7af5ac3898ed19f8f59e7e66a?token=74f5f7a03a8ec7732b5d8618612846fd
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:33:19 Dude, seeing people talk about robocraft makes me miss playing it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:33:24 Imma update it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:33:42 That swastika is very disproportionate
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:33:52 Are swastikas allowed in this game?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:34:07 Good
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:34:32 What are your bots in robocraft?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:34:55 I have a chain shredder mech, the legs are mega mech legs
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:35:02 And a leviathan runner
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:35:26 And my gyro ant was ruined by that one gyro update that stops you from angling your gyro mortars
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 16:35:51 O sorry
general 2018-10-21 16:37:35 Noice
general 2018-10-21 16:37:44 I have a flying leviathan
general 2018-10-21 16:38:39 O right i forgot you had a secret thing
general 2018-10-21 16:39:13 Looks like a happy but dead guy
general 2018-10-21 16:39:23 With an extremely long neck
general 2018-10-21 16:41:58 Wait there’s a community server?
general 2018-10-21 16:42:47 Yeah i saw
general 2018-10-21 16:42:54 I didnt notice that
general 2018-10-21 16:43:11 O i wonder how my friend will react to my seaplane
general 2018-10-21 16:43:26 He tried making one, and while i was building an OS2U, he came up to me
general 2018-10-21 16:43:38 “Dude, it may not  work”
general 2018-10-21 16:43:47 Because his seaplane was a major fail
general 2018-10-21 16:44:02 When he tried to take off the water his plane just nose dives into the water
general 2018-10-21 16:44:25 Well
general 2018-10-21 16:44:34 All he did was convert his simple plane into a seaplan
general 2018-10-21 16:44:41 And all the boueys were at the front
general 2018-10-21 16:44:49 So his tail was literally dipping in the water
general 2018-10-21 16:45:20 Since the boueys were on the front only, the center of mass is at the front, which makes it impossible for his plane to take off of the water
general 2018-10-21 16:45:33 Just sayin’
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 06:43:17 anyone in the community server rn?

creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:13:38 i said ok
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:14:02 but then my friend, who wants to keep anonymous told me Bio claims it to be his own build

creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:34:52 speak english here
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:35:05 now that's just racist
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:21:19 i heard someone built a U-boat
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:21:30 which is something i wanted to make since i encountered a guy with a Submarine earlier
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:21:47 now i'm motivated
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:22:43 why are conversations occuring here instead of general
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:22:52 like, the photos that get sent here are now in creations
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:23:08 eh
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:23:14 imma go make a U-Boat type VII
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:23:22 while im still motivated
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:24:04 general definetaly
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:26:03 ooh i wonder if i can make working torpedoes
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:15 dont worry about it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:24 i could make it function, while looking decent
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:30 have you seen the OS2U i made?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:47 it lands fine, takes off of the water, had 3 hidden propeller engines,
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:28:29 you know what i wants?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:28:41 2 other variants of the propeller engine, one triblade, and the other quad bladed
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:29:12 no, having more propellers actually helps propel
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:30:03 what about replicators such as myself?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:30:18 i would like a tri propeller for my Ju-87 and Bf-109
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:31:32 what?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:31:39 oh wait im a replicator now?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:31:40 :OOO
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:31:42 yaaayyy
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:32:16 i have a problem when it comes to making custom stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:32:26 like, example i try to make a tank, i take inspiration from tiger 1
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:32:38 then i end up with a tiger 1 that just got repainted
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:34:42 the reason i replicate is i think
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:34:55 "this design was successful, so it should work nicely in here aswell"
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:35:04 in which, all 3 of my planes, it happened
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:35:22 they were successful in real life, and they work really well ingame
bug-reports 2018-10-24 05:37:22 any chance the color saving is gonna be fixed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:40:39 someone was crazy enough to make a Schwerer gustav ingame?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:43:51 i had a really good suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:43:57 but when i got on my PC i forgot about it
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:44:31 when i suggest a block should i also explain how it works?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:44:48 alrighty then, because the idea just came back
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:44:57 angle block
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:45:23 it's basically a motor, except when you press the fly button, it instantly goes to the angle you set it to
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:45:33 like, in the settings, you set it to 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:45:43 the moment you press the fly button, it will instantly go there
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:45:46 oh goody
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:46:10 i suggested a change for the motor
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:46:24 where it will lock in position, like no force can push the motor
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:46:34 other than itself
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:46:51 since rickje said it would be hard, i thought of an angle block instead
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:47:40 i didnt suggest it
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:47:43 wait
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:47:48 i suggested it, but it was days ago
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:47:50 but it wasnt a button
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:47:55 it was more of an automatic thing
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:48:07 like, if the motor stops turning, it will become static
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:48:36 how about a setting in the option, like a checkbox?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:48:55 yeah i guess
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:49:23 we should get 2 variants of the angle motor
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:49:35 one as thin as wings, and the other is a normal block
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:49:45 you know what rthro i want?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:49:55 a normal one, where you can use a shirt texture
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:50:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:50:20 that too
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:51:59 o crap my motivation is gone
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:52:03 or almost gone i mean
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:52:08 better start on the U-Boat

bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:07:36 I dont think mass and weight would be the same
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:07:50 Also you set the density of ballasts not the mass
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:08:00 The denser it is the heavier
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:22 Well in real life, weight changes, mass doesnt, weight is affected by gravity
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:32 Like the astronauts on the moon
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:56 The reason they kept falling down is because they’re lighter, but their mass is the same, meaning their inertia is the same
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:28:01 I landed 3 planes on it
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:29:37 Yep
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:30:00 U should see my latest build
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:30:18 I dont have an updated pic rn
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:30:26 Im also updating robocraft
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:30:36 But my latest is a U-boat
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:32:43 Sure
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:02:48 Akali trying to force me to tell him how to make a sub
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:02:59 i told him what he needs, weight, upward and downward thrust
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:03:04 then he asked again
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:03:06 "what do i need"
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:03:10 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:03:52 i told you to think
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:04:01 you obviously need ballasts and movement parts
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:04:49 u could make it easier
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:05:00 my U-Boat is just weights, and my downward thrust is at the tip
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:05:17 i activate my downward thrust, my U-Boat's tip goes down a bit
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:05:26 once i go forward, bam, my sub is submerging
creations-chat 2018-10-25 07:07:38 why did i get dragged into this
bug-reports 2018-10-25 07:08:44 propeller engines lost their sound?
bug-reports 2018-10-25 07:10:32 idk my propeller engines dont make sounds anymore
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:25:50 what peeves me off about the rthro is the fact that they dont have a blank one that allows use of shirt texture
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 07:28:38 well if anthros r humans

plane-crazy 2018-10-25 12:24:23 theres propellers to keep it surfaced
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 12:24:33 and to dive, theres 2 thrusters pointed down at the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 12:48:23 can the color pallete be changed to the brick color palette?

plane-crazy 2018-10-25 14:32:45 I upgrade my U-Boat, the tip now has 4 jets instead of 2, it makes the Sub dive faster
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 00:57:34 are databanks not compatible with Plane Crazy?

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:37 I’m starting you see what VipEmpire meant by “i have to deal with this crap everyday”
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:54 Oo rick is on
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:25 He mentioned about how gamesuggestions has suggestions repeat almost everyday
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:34:06 And about how people arent supposed to tell VipEmpire what rank they should get
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:34:21 Then some dude posted a U-boat “expert replicator pls”
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:29 I guess
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:44 But you get rank depending on what you build, you dont tell them what to give you
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:53 How do some people not understand that?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:15 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:30 This just reminds me of the time where i spent 3 weeks Making a Tiger 1 replica in BYM
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:42 Then somehow it got judged by an apparent “biased” judge
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:52 So my rank is “good” now in that game
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:26 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:31 Well idk
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:48 It’s been weeks and us tankers in the BYM community are still saying
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:55 “Us tankers need a tank judge”
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:39:13 I still play it, around level 500 now
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:39:59 Built 5 tanks, 2 of them got a rebuilt, 1 of them is currently just a model.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:40:23 Thinking about Building a tank makes me wanna procrastinate
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:40:40 You have to make the shells, the barrel, a turret, tracks, then the plate armor.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:41:32 Oh crap

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:43:52 Oo so close to master
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:07 My carrier is around 950 i think
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:14 And my U-boat is around 400
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:46 Then my other builds, my 3 planes are below 200
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:32 The rocket?

plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:44:39 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:44:40 i see
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:44:56 no i meant
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:45:07 official Plane Crazy community server
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:46:22 is that
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:46:24 a KV-1?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:06:57 <@!425729688166727680> you spelled Missouri wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:07:53 or that too
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:08:11 but USS Missouri was a famous ship
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:18:37 ow
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:18:44 arena has no water
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:18:47 i learned that the hard way
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:54:52 Chudy, it was the 75 that was short
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:54:58 76 was the long barrel
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:55:56 75 could pen the front of the f2
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:56:05 But f2 can outrange the 75
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:56:48 So wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:56:54 Did the wooden ones actually function?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 08:57:26 Hmm, didn’t know the Panzer 1 was used
general 2018-11-17 08:59:01 <@451991788757057543> thats not how tank battles work
general 2018-11-17 08:59:16 Theres light tanks capable of killing heavies
general 2018-11-17 08:59:23 It’s easy to flank a heavy
general 2018-11-17 09:00:33 Patton and abrams were mediums if i remember correctly
general 2018-11-17 09:00:41 The idea of heavy tanks were abandoned
general 2018-11-17 09:00:53 Idk
general 2018-11-17 09:01:09 Yeah
general 2018-11-17 09:01:16 They were practically huge targets
general 2018-11-17 09:01:21 And a big waste of resources
general 2018-11-17 09:02:01 Yeah germans were weird
general 2018-11-17 09:02:12 Maus was a good idea, but it was very impractical
general 2018-11-17 09:02:28 Huge silhouette, slow speed, easy target for planes.
general 2018-11-17 09:02:37 But the armor and gun were good against enemy tanks
general 2018-11-17 09:02:52 Yeah
general 2018-11-17 09:02:59 U need
general 2018-11-17 09:03:02 A high penetration gun
general 2018-11-17 09:03:09 And have to get behind it
general 2018-11-17 09:03:18 Penetrating the front just gets the driver and engine
general 2018-11-17 09:03:33 The back of the turret is a good target, for it has an ammo rack there
general 2018-11-17 09:03:47 No that’s just a radio operator
general 2018-11-17 09:03:55 But he could take over if the driver died
general 2018-11-17 09:04:19 Ratte was way bigger though
general 2018-11-17 09:04:25 Triple thick tracks per side
general 2018-11-17 09:04:50 They took the guns of the Scarnhorst, and mounted it on a double gun turret
general 2018-11-17 09:05:01 No
general 2018-11-17 09:05:07 IS-2 is a heavy
general 2018-11-17 09:05:20 No way it was medium
general 2018-11-17 09:05:43 They only had 2 maus prototypes
general 2018-11-17 09:05:52 They never actually produced it
general 2018-11-17 09:06:50 That doesnt really make the IS series a medium tank
general 2018-11-17 09:07:23 IS-2 either
general 2018-11-17 09:07:38 How?
general 2018-11-17 09:07:54 They branched off of KV tanks
general 2018-11-17 09:08:12 If they were to make them mediums, it would branch Off the T-34
general 2018-11-17 09:10:47 KV-13 wouldnt have been made if there wasnt a T-34 and a KV-1
general 2018-11-17 09:11:12 There was no IS-85
general 2018-11-17 09:11:32 You’re talking about a KV-85
general 2018-11-17 09:12:50 Never heard of IS-85 before
general 2018-11-17 09:12:55 Only KV-85
general 2018-11-17 09:13:38 Branched from KV-1 to KV-85 to the IS-1 then IS-2
general 2018-11-17 09:13:51 You just made my brain hurt by saying IS-85 instead of IS-1
general 2018-11-17 09:16:16 That i heard of
general 2018-11-17 09:16:27 But IS-85 i literally never heard of before
general 2018-11-17 09:18:15 Yeah
general 2018-11-17 09:18:24 They mounted an IS-2 turret on a KV chassis
general 2018-11-17 09:20:12 JS is for english men
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 09:23:22 Best thing you can hear from rickje

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:31:27 just before the tail

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:37:27 https://gyazo.com/e0abb8b769f3caeb24e50a40d92cad62
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:42:10 omfg my fuselage is tiled
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:42:19 the "lock" option is a scam
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:45:03 time to revert what i did
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:55:48 nvm the scam part
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:55:51 i realized the problem
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:07:39 makes sense i guess
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:07:40 but then
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:07:48 when my plane got flipped, i pressed the flip button
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:07:58 the wing collided on the ground
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:08:07 causing it to fold under the fuselage
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:08:24 i
bug-reports 2018-12-11 12:08:28 just reverted it and closed the game

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 12:11:41 Wasnt really a reminder but ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:38:19 Submarine Commander is too easy for me to gain

bug-reports 2018-12-12 06:10:14 You can?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:10:36 Yeah i was thinking half block thick
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:10:45 Or just triple the current wing thickness
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:11:10 Then a double thickness

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:25:11 Mine could be useful too tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:25:23 A tnt block with only 2 welding points
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:31:01 Integex
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:31:10 Replace ur beams with normal blocks to increase block count
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:31:31 It also makes it more durable
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:31:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:31:49 What
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:32:06 But how come hitting a beam, takes the hole beam if you repeatedly hit the one spot
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:32:18 But if you repeatedly hit one spot in blocks, only 1 disappears
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:34:05 Oh well that doesnt make a whole lotta sense

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:40:12 Ooh damn
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:42:49 <@!251794298914209792>  which version of the P. 1500 are you doung
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:43:34 If wedges disappear my builds would be extremely ugly
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:51:33 The barrel doesnt turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:51:43 HHOLY DAMN THAT IOWA HOT
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:52:52 Already done
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:52:56 I have a walker
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:53:37 Also 5 studs is basically how big 2 blocks are
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:53:45 AKA the height of a robloxian
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:53:48 Is 2 studs
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:54:39 It wasnt built for combat
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:54:46 The gustav was made for bunker busting
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:55:01 And it was pretty impractical considering the 30-45 minute reload
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:55:18 Wdym
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:55:42 What?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:55:43 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:55:52 The gustav didnt even flip when it was on rails
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:56:11 Yes and the p1500 chassis has WAY more weight
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:56:18 Which means you need a bigger force to push it
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:56:38 No that!s the rail version, replaced with tracks
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:56:43 Still no
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:56:50 That’s just the rail version
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:57:00 Except replaced the wheels with tracks
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:57:24 Also, mostly the gun points so high up that the push force is mostly downwards
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:57:47 Because it was never built
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:57:56 No only the rail one was made
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:58:20 I think i have a friend with an ATC towerh
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:58:38 He got angery because my bf-109 took off without permission
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 02:58:57 Then my he-111 took off with permission
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:00:15 Wait he did?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:00:23 What does he do now?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:00:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:01:00 The gustav is a huge artillery piece
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:01:17 Why’d you think it aims up so high
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:07:52 Why are you calling it a turret
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:07:58 It’s only the gun
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:08:06 The P. 1500 doesnt have a turret
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:08:24 Sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 03:08:30 Just a tank addict speaking
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 15:22:17 it's not a plane if it doesnt have wings

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:30:47 Use a disconnector for the table, so you have only a plate instead of a wedge
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:31:11 I use it for almost all my builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:31:26 Like
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:31:54 I remove blocks and replace them with prop engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:31:59 Then i put disconnectors

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:38:41 https://gyazo.com/c69ac68d0311657a819b95ada6c3fc11
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:38:49 you can see the rockets when you peek down the tube
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:41:12 idk theres a crap ton of factors that affected it
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:41:31 my break times, the building of the firefly, the converting the firefly into the M4a4, then adding the calliope
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:43:31 you do

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:45:35 i put 4 keybinds, 1 keybind fires 17 rockets each
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:46:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:46:56 also the calliope destroyed my friend's tiger with only 17 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:48:18 theres a tank community ingame that really hates block armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 02:48:32 block armor is essentially armoring your tank with blocks thicker than .2

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:37:47 wait 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:38:26 do Shift + H
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:38:41 it's the one the game Build and Destroy uses
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:38:43 shift and H
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:39:07 club penguin is kil
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:39:37 ctrl + p

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:47:56 does anyone here have a huge ass carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:48:07 i wanna practice landing an Osprey on a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:48:28 you got a big carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:48:35 :0
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:48:46 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:49:57 i kinda wanna see a
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:50:05 gyroscopic motor or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:50:21 wait did ospreys have swashplates
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:51:30 hot
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:58:59 has a motor with limited turning been suggested already?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:59:28 are we at the point where everything's been suggested
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:59:55 i have this idea for a gyroscopic motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:59:59 basically
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:04 if you point the motor up
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:10 then your creation tilts
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:23 the motor adjusts so that the thing attached to it doenst tilt
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:26 o what
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:34 then you can
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:37 point it forward
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:00:42 and it does the same
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:01:24 BYM bumpers
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:01:49 BnD doesnt have gyroscopic motors though
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:02:16 that's not what i meant when i said gyroscoping motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:02:24 think of it as a tank's Gyroscopic stabilizer on the gun
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:02:34 Modern tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:04:19 this community is epic
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:04:29 an idea gets bashed into the ground without even understanding what it is
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:05:08 i actually tried suggesting aerodynamics into BnD
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:08:09 what does nil mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:08:35 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:23:03 can we get the option to turn wing panels into glass
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 13:23:10 it could be very useful
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 04:20:22 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 04:20:25 most accurate
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 04:20:29

plane-crazy 2019-08-22 14:32:30 i can't glass my Osprey's cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 14:32:41 because the top has a 2 wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 03:16:15 i like how my build tilts backward when it's on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 03:16:20 then tilts forward like hell when it flies
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 03:21:48 A-10 Thunderbolt
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 09:14:19 damn
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 09:14:22 the new propellers are hot
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 09:14:28 but still too small for my builds
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 09:21:18 look at how small this is
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 09:21:30 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 10:00:57 what's a ballast tank?
