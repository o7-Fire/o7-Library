bug-reports 2019-01-03 23:28:52 My planes work well, but after a few seconds of flying, they start to spaz out for no reason I know of. Even the smallest plane from the tutorial suffers from this glitch. However, my biggest plane fortunately does not spaz out, but it does get shaky while in flight.
bug-reports 2019-01-03 23:29:26 Note that I have died more from this glitch than from actual players.

bug-reports 2019-02-02 06:30:42 When I fly my plane and fly it downwards, the plane starts to nod up and down, the more speed, the more sporadic the nodding becomes.
