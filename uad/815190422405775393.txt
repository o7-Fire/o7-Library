plane-crazy 2022-12-21 21:27:48 "youve got a hole in your right wing!"
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 21:28:19 the floor fell eventually
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 21:30:13 "welcome to the warzone!"
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 21:30:50 
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 21:31:00 i think gravity is needed for this one
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:31:42 me looking at the builds i spent blood, sweat and tears making just to see it get downvoted 4 - 9 (atleast my corvette is going positive!)
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:34:18 still sad to see the corvette being hated, imo its a fucking sick looking plane
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:36:25 its one of those builds that are like, its old so finding good material for it is annoying, in the sense that its from an anime and not a movie which you can get the model for
the-dump 2022-12-21 23:11:50 name the flag <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:28:35 for what ive attempted at recreating its pretty accurate right? (envelope looks different because most of the source images i used had an envelope shaped that way)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:40:29 i mean the overall color of the tiger moth is fairly bland, just being yk "brown"
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 11:41:29 lets see what people think of my 6000 block ship lol
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:43:26 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:46:24 yeah i know, but considering the fucking nightmare that my g38 is when it comes to motor locking i doubt i would have much luck with the skull and lettering
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:48:25 but looking back at the 3 other tiger moths that have been posted in this server i can say mine atleast has the general shape of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 11:49:51 hold on if my great eastern gets a good score can it get me the master shipwright role?
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 11:49:56 i mean it is 6000 blocks

creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:39:14 isnt really boring to use, can fly really fast and is super mobile, best part is when you fly in and blast some helicopter out of the sky with the rockets under the fuselage, not a super boring plane imo (it can hover like a VTOL aswell)

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:48:56 like youll make a fairly accurate building for a difficult plane to make and people will look into the tiniest of fucking details
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:49:03 "wings slightly too thick"
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:49:22 didnt want the roblox character to have to smash their head againt the roof when getting out of their seat my bad
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:52:24 had no room to make the cables sorry, the landing gear itself is folded at the bottom because of how the wings are folded there is no more room to have the landing gear be straight
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:55:29 motor lock is horrid, trying to work with limited space around the aircraft that doesn require branching out (also its called making it to scale and not some shitty 1/3 scale version you idiot)
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:59:20 opinions on the corvette?
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:02:23 plane crazy sopro is the type of person to say the small one is better
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:02:32 "bigger builds doesnt mean its better11!1!!1!1"
creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:04:20 yeah it does a bit, its from a 80s anime lol, it was shit in the movie, got shot down with a single shot from a gunship, bursted into flames and plumited to the ground

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:20:19 the same guy with this pigeon that looks like its about to fall apart is calling these planes bad
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:20:23 genuinely
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:20:34 make a good build before saying that other decent builds look like shite

creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:25:06 problem is i cant get a video cuz the only recorder i have is fucked lol, and i aint bothered to go through 20 minutes to download one from google lol

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:35:21 alot

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:55:48 light, medium and heavy
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:05 light fires fastest, medium is well what we have now, and heavy being like an autocannon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:17 iykwim
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:23 and fire slower
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:43 different ones aswell would be neat

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:51 and they have kick and shit
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:07 so if you put in on the tutorial plane for example you would get sent
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:09 because its smol
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:17 altho bypassing this with anchors

creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:27:48 around 400 speed for this plane (the 4 winged blue one) that I have it set to ingame is fast enough right? (Video shows how fast it goes)
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:31:38 How the hell does that get 100+ with 25 down votes and this gets 90 with 45?!
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:41:33 main improvements in mind is a whole new paint job, some motor lock and maybe a fresh interior
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:41:39 Possibly might reshape the nose
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:41:44 Because it isn't as sharp
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:41:56 Will do
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:42:07 I mean the previous ones were sorta poor
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 19:42:10 90 and 46

plane-crazy 2022-12-30 00:06:34 h- how- how did you- know?!
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:08:09 does using engines for hovering/propulsion on a vtol aircraft effect aeronautical role? As in it says cannot use engines for propulsion only wings, and the plane I had in mind making uses engines to hover
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:15:17 okay good, issue now is getting the plane stable without helium,  look at this goofy ass, doesn't even have a tail
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:19:55 I mean I've built it twice (with helium) but the proportions are a bit off (nose to sharp and shit) which is why I wonna remake it
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 00:21:41 Yall think I should remake this for a 3rd time so it's proportions are more accurate?
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 00:23:43 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 00:27:55 stwop fwoodin chwat!1!!1!1!1
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:39:40 it's an armored corvette, it's a pretty large plane lol, it has like 2 floors (I think)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:43:09 torumekian armored corvette (it's a plane)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:45:21 I mean considering it has like 8 gunner stations I'd say its pretty armored (3 at back, 4 at front and 2 ontop)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:47:24 it also has 4 self guiding rockets underneath the fuselage/nose
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:52:17 it's also a vtol and is also super maneuverable, + having a bay for dropping off soldiers into combat
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:57:20 try answering this and tell me why it has such poor downvotes lol
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:00:16 details lack in areas such as?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:03:14 I mean the original main plane is over a year old, so I'm planning to entirely remake it (for a 3rd time) ironing out all of the issues (also the trail on the nose is there on purpose) (and on the wing)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:31:59 these ones?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 02:19:57 nah who sleeps? I usually stay in bed till 3/4am contemplating life

plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:31:51 the nose is now more accurate in terms of proportions right? (left is v3, right is v2)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:32:06 this sis what it should be like (the nose)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:32:17 also its a good few blocks larger
creations-chat 2022-12-30 16:33:30 proportions are more accurate now right guys? (bottom shows how it should look)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:33:42 only real way to do it lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:33:47 could maybe do motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:33:57 (its like a uhh symbol of sorts)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:34:07 it is a half block
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:34:30 so you see
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:34:40 mine is just a half block with yellow trails on the outside lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:34:44 does the job well
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:34:50 used it on the first version
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:35:04 its came a far way lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:35:12 this was the first version
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:35:23 thats like 2 years old lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:35:54 version 1, 2 and 3 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:36:04 there is about a years worth of experience between each
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:36:22 altho the 2nd one is more so i made it a year ago and added onto it
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:36:37 (thickening the wings, adding small details like trails etc)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:37:11 this is the first image of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:37:13 and its from...
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:37:31 12th of december 2021 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:37:37 gonna do that now
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:38:17 https://tenor.com/view/esqueleto-gif-24452082
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:38:26 we will see
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:39:21 sorta does?
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:39:34 i mean if i could put something in the middle to make it look better i would
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:39:53 its like a dot with a curve underneath
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:40:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:03 issue is gonna be the interior
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:07 because i "think" it has 2 floors
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:09 because uhh
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:13 lemme find the pic rq
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:37 
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:41:46 where the gunner sits above the loading bay
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:42:00 could just be a ladder tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:42:13 i mean i have a pic of the inside near that part and there is a ladder
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 16:42:17 that leads to the gunner above (ontop of the fuselage)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:54:30 so far so good
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:54:56 still got alot of the interior to do, wings, and then extra details (like how the old one had loads of trails and shit)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:56:02 1138 blocks already lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:56:11 thats already almost half of the 2nd version
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:56:17 which is around 2400
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 17:56:26 2532*
creations-chat 2022-12-30 17:57:25 progress going smooth (about 1/3 of the way done building lol)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:11:27 given up on the v3 of the corvette, just gonna improve the 2nd one
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:12:02 too much of a hastle to make a 3rd one, and looking at it its sorta uhh
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:12:08 well the 2nd one sorta looks better
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:19:24 probably
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:29:00 this is about the only visible (in one piece) pic i have of v1
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 20:29:16 so you see what i mean by (in one piece)

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:54:50 https://tenor.com/view/the-voices-gif-26307682
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:55:04 only build i (could maybe) get a rank for is my ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:55:09 which is over 6000 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:55:18 but it has balancing issues
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:55:22 and i dont know
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:55:26 HOW TO FUCKING FIX IT
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:57:24 im arguing with a kid with a modified tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:57:28 https://tenor.com/view/squid-game-smile-torture-misery-eternal-gif-23316420
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:59:13 do you reckon this could get shipwright X?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:59:21 its 6113 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:59:26 and has a mostly full interior
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:59:43 elaborate
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:59:44 why not
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:00:49 only said X because its 6113 blocks lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:00:57 which it said (have a ship with over 6000 blocks)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:01:15 it got a fairly good score in creations i think
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:01:37 69 - 31
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:01:38 meh
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:01:58 ah it says get into hall of fame
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:02:11 i thought it meant like
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:02:16 (its a good build)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:02:24 (you should put it into the hall of fame)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:02:29 not its a requirement lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:11 i mena the ship itself isnt too special
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:16 it has 5 funnels which is neat
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:23 and the largest water paddle ever
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:32 or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:42 well thats a shame i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:47 ill take V tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:55 maybe when pc2 comes out
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:03:59 i plan to remake it full scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:05 which isnt too impossible rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:13 it just i lack room for the decking and funnels etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:24 altho the decks are pretty flat tbf
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:33 as shown by the picture
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:48 its like titanic size lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:50 but not as tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:04:58 its like 200 smth metres i think?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:05:08 211m
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:00 in areas such as?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:18 i mean i guess the windows on the decks and shit could be improved
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:22 and the walls on the inside
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:27 altho i lack images for interior
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:40 
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:45 
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:48 these are like the only good ones
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:06:53 im aware
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:07 im stuck with 4x wedges yk
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:10 and i didnt think of
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:16 the motor technique
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:34 okay we get it im aware it wouldnt get x
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:56 but when the longer wedges get added making an accurate bow should be easier
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:07:59 or well
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:08:10 stretching the wedges or whatever
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:09:18 you can see the shape from here
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:09:25 im aware mine is different
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:09:32 but thats due to limited space to work with
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:09:40 because the plot is super cramped
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:10:07 this is what i meant by the decks are mostly bland
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:10:11 there isnt much there
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:11:01 what about them>
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:11:03 ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:12:28 the life boat davits down really change the fact the decks are bland
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:12:42 *the* private server?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:14:13 opinions on this G.38?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:14:25 before you go "wing too big waaa!"
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:14:30 they are supposed to be big
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:14:36 you walk inside them
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:15:14 the motor locking that is in place atm is super messy (for my standards)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:15:29 because it has the seats and shit in it (the motor locking)

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:44:14 my very first motor lock build
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:44:21 as you could tell its very bad lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:44:56 litteraly said it was bud
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:45:04 it was my first motor lock build
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:46:35 very simple not over complicated with motor locking dornier do x
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:46:40 i think its neat
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:47:05 (for a build without any motor locking)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:47:11 before you bitch and say it looks bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:47:54 without
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:48:11 the only locked motors are for the half block signs
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:48:15 so they look better
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:48:36 i refer to the motor locking as in shit like yk
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:48:39 the messy shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:48:54 this messy shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:52:30 the pc killing I-400
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:52:51 this build has single handedly crashed my pc on like 10 different occasions
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:53:18 its not even that big aswell lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:53:43 or well thats because it isnt to scale lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:54:06 the real thing could hold up to 3 fucking planes inside its little tube looking shit

plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:57:03 should i try build a (largest possible size as of now) of this airship or try make a full scale in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:57:21 this thing is like 340m long xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:58:19 block scale im guessing?
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:59:05 i mean look at it to scale with the soldiers xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:59:08 its fucking massive
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:59:30 would look badass to scale tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:59:40 its loaded with cannons and machine guns like there is no tommorow
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:59:51 it basically has artillery on the underneath
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:00:08 
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:00:22 
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:01:38 i know lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:01:45 but imagine the horror
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:01:55 of seeing this goliath in your lobby
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:02:35 top 10 reasons why we need clouds we can interact with
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:02:49 imagine flying above the clouds and seeing this break through it
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:03:20 xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:03:31 i mean its from the 80s dont ask how they decided on how physics worked
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:03:46 they have fucking floating castle for fuck sake
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:03:57 evidently
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:04:18 these guns on the side arent
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:04:23 altho these are alot smaller caliber
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:04:28 compared to the guns underneath
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:04:39 that are basically ones stripped from a naval ship lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:04:45 oh yeah its loaded with props
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:05:12 
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:05:24 this is moments before it gets destroyed lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:05:36 it catches fire and breaks down the middle
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:05:41 ong ong
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:05:59 the amount of power required to get it to even lift must be mental
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:06:18 it even has 3 recon planes on the underneath aswell lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:06:24 near the middle
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:06:39 i mean it was swarmed by flying robots xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:06:51 one robot managed to destroy that fortress that was in one of the pictures
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:07:00 (the robots are basically bulletproof)
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:07:19 it took 2 naval ship sized cannons to destroy one of them
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:08:00 
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:08:06 only slight little accident
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:09:53 this castle is also super fucking overpowered lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:10:09 as shown by *the fireball*
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:10:54 basically
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:11:12 it fires like a ring that turns into a ball
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:11:27 that does this xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:11:59 idfk ask hayao miyazaki
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:12:10 he directed the film xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:12:56 anyhow ill see what i can do with the airship
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 11:13:06 if i can make it any larger than what i have now
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 12:56:52 because we can xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 13:11:42 now imagine if the KX-3 was full scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 13:11:48 the zero would be tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 13:12:28 as shown by a drawing like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:17:57 let me guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:18:00 it has a guns gamepass

creations-chat 2023-01-25 17:08:39 thoughts on this sorta iffy attempt on an SR-72?

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:54:50 interior isnt the most detailed but i severely lack images for it cuz the ship is over 150 years old
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:55:30 yep
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:55:35 then land on it xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:55:37 because it so big
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:55:44 but they always end up falling off it xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:56:02 pic goes hard
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:56:13 xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:56:20 like 6100
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:56:31 (6113)
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:56:58 oooo
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:12 yeah i was looking at that one
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:18 cant get master cuz shit aint detailed enough
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:38 i made the ship like months ago
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:46 and i fuck about with it alot when im bored
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:54 the only real change that has been done is the anchor at the front xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:00 i can always add more to it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:07 altho i dont think my pc would appreciate that
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:20 anyway im making a full scale one when pc2 releases
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:25 so that should get me master
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:35 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:46 i could nearly make one now
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:50 but i lacked length for it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:59:43 you should see my main fighter lmao
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:00:06 (totally isnt too big)
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:00:22 it looks different now cuz shit got a movie accurate paint job
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:05 hate those fuckers
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:10 my plane cant do that xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:16 it can sorta do some manuevers
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:27 but not 1K super fast turns like most jets can
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:34 which is why it gets out-gunned super easily
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:50 second my plane loses a wing it cant fly straight at all xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:53 damn vtol planes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:02:06 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:02:20 unless it loses 2 wings so they balance eachother out
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:02:43 only upside to having a large fighter is that shit is tanky
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:06 unless you take out one of my wings
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:08 then its over

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:10 it just tilts to the side
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:16 i tried to even it out but that didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:27:12 pic goes hard

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:38 or well
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:50 i added rockets so if it tries to fall over ill just push it back up
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:02 it fell over after
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:04 cuz yk
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:05 my luck
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:18 so ive added rockets at the bottom to balance it when it tries to capsize
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:55 it works
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:45:57 so im sticking with it

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:09:46 but the whole engine room would be under water
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:09:50 not as if it wasnt already
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 12:09:58 it was basically half under water anyway
