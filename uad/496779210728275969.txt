help 2021-10-06 22:21:10 so i have a space ship, and in the content its based off, it can jam missiles and pull ships out of lightspeed. i know that pulling ships out of light speed in PC would be useless, so does anyone know a way i can jam guided missiles?
help 2021-10-14 18:03:55 Would it be possible to construct a working rubix cube in plane crazy?
help 2021-10-14 18:07:40 i thought possibly motors, but you wouldnt' be able to connect all sides to a motor
help 2021-11-24 15:41:26 can anyone tell me how i could angle lock my canopy of my plane? i dont image perms so i cant really show, but it has a lot of different angles, and im not sure how i would approah it

help 2021-11-24 15:47:04 ok, but how would i go about adding the trail peices, (forgot the name)
help 2021-11-24 18:26:46 yes, but if you look at some better made planes, you can see they use trails as almost like supports in the glass
help 2021-11-24 18:27:07 i know it requires angle locking, but i'm not very experienced in it.
help 2021-11-24 19:04:28 hmm, maybe. Im not very good at making compact motor lock systems
help 2021-11-24 21:20:50 so, is there some secret to heli building that i dont know? ive built quite a few, but they can never balance and control smoothly
help 2021-11-24 21:21:50 like i know how to make rotors and stuff, but not how to balance

plane-crazy 2022-02-15 13:49:41 so, is there any material in-game that is actually shiny, cause metal (and all forms of it) look like default
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 13:50:28 i tried those, but when i say shiny, i mean like polished chrome
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 13:50:37 and plus, foil texture is a bit busy

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:12:52 its a pain to decorate anything now
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:12:56 since its all sensored
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:14:39 i dont understand why a red square is considered bad enough to tag
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:15:55 toaster would do a better job
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:16:03 dont insult toasters like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:17:31 sir please tell me how you got all the emojis past moderation

help 2022-06-09 13:24:27 it's my private server
help 2022-06-09 13:47:55 went into a public and still have the same problem
creations-chat 2022-06-09 16:47:36 i cant seem to get the right amount of detail with any other material. the engines are actually the correct size, i just had a bad camera angle
creations-chat 2022-06-09 17:02:05 no other engines are blue and big
creations-chat 2022-06-09 17:20:56 thats what i have rn
creations-chat 2022-06-09 21:50:25 i'll  definitely be doing an executor ssd and redoing my venator when it comes out. cant wait
creations-chat 2022-06-10 13:04:44 <@668314196764655618> how did you do that star? ive been trying to make one for a few days now, and emojis arent big enough
creations-chat 2022-08-02 00:00:58 looks pretty good, but it doesnt even have to take off, its already above the target. gun could be a bit shorter aswell
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 23:12:47 pc2 still coming out?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 23:13:08 seems like a pretty big lack of updates
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:24:15 so tomorrow is the last day of summer
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 13:57:33 i always hear about people using m2 for locking, but they don't have a lock function themselves?
bot-central 2022-09-26 13:57:47 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 14:10:04 it would help if i could get set angles though'
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 14:10:13 instead of respawning 3 times to get it just right
creations-chat 2022-09-26 16:09:47 round intakes. how

help 2022-09-27 18:32:17 it has that little lip but i cant really do much about it seems
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:14:29 does anyone have an image of what a nose cone lock pattern actually looks like? been trying to make one but its not working too well
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:14:56 thats not an option
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:15:30 custom
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:15:34 just gonna see what i can do
help 2022-11-24 15:37:32 good length for SR-71? im gonna add the pointed tip onto the back, but this includes the entire length of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:00:00 is a 1x2 retractable landing gear possible
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:02:20 the premade landing gear would snap like a twig under my jet if physics were real
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:02:28 i need something a bit thicker than the premade
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:03:31 
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:03:36 bad angle
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:08:14 all the locking for the plane is right about where the front gear should be
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:08:31 and i have to put the other gears into the jets since the wings are too thin
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:09:04 yeah still working on the exposed stuff
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:10:10 the jets arent much better though, seeing as they are angle locked
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:11:20 id definitely have to build it outside and lock it into the build, but id have to have enough space for the motor2 to not glitch out
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:14:07 should check that eas alert
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:24:33 managed to get a working one, although its quite messy
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:26:05 yeah, i had to mess with some other locking at the top area to give myself another 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:26:34 this is probably the best i can get
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:28:59 how can i get my plane to maintain altitude?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:29:08 i always have to be in take off flaps to prevent it from crashing
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:38:30 sorry for the bad angle, its a tight spot
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:38:38 i didnt think that much of a difference would matter
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:44:32 its an sr-71, so all the wings are on the back
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:45:42 as of right now, 400ish, but im gonna speed it up quite a bit
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:45:59 down
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:46:05 unless i have takeoff flaps activated
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:46:48 i had hover engines originally, but they still couldn't break 1000
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:48:46 i also had a lag problem using hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:48:50 since they are physics based
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:50:17 would those be less laggy?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 14:51:46 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 15:11:37 so how fast would an sr 71 go in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 15:12:51 as a american, this is extremely helpful
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 15:14:17 seems good enough to me
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 16:18:34 anyone got an idea how i could do this cone thing on top of the Maus
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 16:19:02 any specific one in mind?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:21:55 another 60 degrees and you could make pasta on that thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:23:03 i dont think that's good
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:25:03 move to florida with that thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:25:12 if it blows, you'd be doing us a favor
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:25:24 a coldfront for a week
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:07:23 you think if every member of the server paid rickje 5 bucks, he would release pc2?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:07:34 i mean thats like a 200,000 dollar bribe
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:13:00 -1 cause rickje wouldnt pay himself
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:13:10 so 188,990
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:27:47 still
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:27:53 thats quite the bribe
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:30:44 highly unlikely
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:31:01 especially if they cant even get out the winter event for pc1
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 14:32:43 the soviets are proud
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 15:36:19 why are these treads so loose
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 15:36:24 they fit the wheels perfect in build
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 15:51:15 i cant make them shorter otherwise the wheels wont fit
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:19:56 decided to use smaller wheels, have the 2 side ones pushed up and outwards with pistons and its still loose
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:20:07 
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:43:44 using 2 pistons now and its tight, but has a big gap
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:43:57 i could probably fit another wheel, but not sure how i could put it in
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:58:00 who, what, and why is nightchaser
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 16:59:30 the tiger 2?
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 17:02:51 yeah is there something special about that one im not seeing?
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 17:04:19 im not sure its hof worthy
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 15:00:19 with as much time as this is taking, pc2 better be the most rtx ultra hd 4k ps5 raytraced crap ive ever seen
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 15:01:06 i will not be controlled by the people
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 15:01:10 pc2 is real
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 15:01:53 pc2 exists
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 20:18:54 if he makes more than one post a year, something is wrong
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 15:12:44 what is there to not understand

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 15:55:11 this simplicity is beautiful

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:07:26 pcc community on their way to harass a new player and give no advice on how to improve their build:
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:08:09 the most adviceful advice
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:08:40 if a build doesnt use all 2000 motors, pcc will find your ip and personally blow your head off with a shotgun
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:09:36 if the man posts a tut build on pcc, hes dead
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:09:41 theres no coming back

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:10:54 not enough words, make more
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:11:12 pathetic
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:12:16 as nice as this is, its unfortunate that pcc doesnt know the meaning of respect
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:13:39 someone posts first build (maybe)
build gets called bad
he says more people should be nice
community calls law enforcement
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:14:10 this is lookin like a florida headline
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:14:28 only cause i know all these fools had builds just as bad at one point
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:14:59 my first build was a heavily edited started plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:15:10 looked like cheese graters taped to a twig

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:24:11 i just heard pc2 is, infact, real
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:24:35 can we fly much higher
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:27:02 pc2 leak real:
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:32:30 hes doing a sucky job at keeping this rumor cause im bout ready to quit
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:35:21 i really hope the whole "studio looks bad" isnt the real reason why they are taking so long

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 18:24:59 its not real
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 18:25:11 its a lie made up by rickje to please the masses
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 19:11:11 pc2 is fake
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 19:11:14 dont believe the lies
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:27:37 if you move the mouse around a ton while you have the control set on, it will show up as mousemovements
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:27:50 not sure what it does, seeing as ive never tested it
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:25 so i heard you should use pistons for precise angle locking, but they just get pushed back in by the motors. any help?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:42 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:05 yep
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:20 br
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:01 when i spawn it, it starts extended
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:36 
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:50 
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:06:31 lock just worked, but still have no idea why the start extended
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:07:24 the lock works about 18% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:08:12 what the heck is vip 1

plane-crazy 2022-12-05 01:55:42 at this point, every build idea i get just gets put into the "ill do it when pc2 comes out"
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 02:05:58 imagine not getting a 6 digit fps in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 02:06:46 you running on the school chromebook or something
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:02:01 are you doing it to scale or upscaled
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:03:00 if you are doing it to scale, functioning treads will be difficult if not impossible
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:03:12 as far as im aware, theres no way to make 1 block treads
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:04:03 that depends on how you build it, but personally i dont like to scale up builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:04:20 they clearly just turn the steering wheel
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:05:34 why dont they just let the ammo canisters not get shot
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:05:37 not that hard
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:06:10 one man inside has to ride a bicycle to make the wheels go
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:10:03 fun fact, tank ammunition is propelled via a man blowing into the barrel
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:10:32 only german tanks do
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:10:56 the rest of the world hasn't unlocked german engineering yet
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:11:06 they dont have enough xp
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:12:28 germans got a massive kill streak and each one is a 1.5x xp multiplier
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 03:13:20 br they told me they were just good
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 13:50:30 how are all these guys making tanks with flush turrets
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 13:50:50 anytime one of my tank turrets are flush, it cant move cause it just grinds on the base
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 13:51:56 pistons have the stability of rickje after working on pc2 for 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:06:44 i dont really see how you could mess them up
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:06:48 theres 2 buttons
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:10:35 still inconsistent
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:10:49 it never is the same angle as the last
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:20:13 i legit spawn it and it will be slightly past the angle, then after respawning it will be slightly short of the angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:20:27 theres no thought needed for piston locking
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:20:37 its just hoping the game decides to get it right
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:22:15 skill
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:22:19 clearly it has to do with skill
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:22:42 even just testing with 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:22:47 when they lock, they move back slightly
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:23:41 but heres the thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:23:51 they only move back slightly about 25% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 14:24:02 so when i chance the extend value, it will still mess it up
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:46:32 so can we pronounce rickje dead
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:46:38 its been 2 months since he has said a word
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:47:36 he either is getting 100% on genshin or he is dead
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:47:46 either way pc2 is cancelled
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 01:47:29 he has become the very thing he swore to destroy
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 01:48:48 i couldve made a pc3 in the time its been since rickjes last message in the server
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 01:50:03 br there aint nothing to jinx
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 01:50:11 its been 2 months since the man has spoken
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 01:50:15 there is no way he is still alive

general 2022-12-14 19:55:29 so would it be smart to send the funny dev men a dm WITHOUT a portfolio, cause i do modeling, but havent made a portfolio yet
general 2022-12-14 19:57:09 i dont really have alot of stuff cause i cant get people to hire me due to a lack of portfolio
general 2022-12-14 19:57:24 you need people to hire you so you can make a portfolio, but people wont hire you without one
general 2022-12-14 19:57:45 very
general 2022-12-14 20:00:29 id be more than happy to model them some stuff as an example, but i dont have enough ideas to build a portfolio

general 2022-12-14 20:13:09 that making in pc1 would be pain
general 2022-12-14 20:13:48 non-stick blocks, more materials, lockable motor 2, bigger plot
general 2022-12-14 20:13:54 all of those and pc would be perfect

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:43:21 i dont think rickje has updated the game since they broke
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:44:18 pretty sure theres a plugin the lets you do that
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:44:23 i remember seeing something like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:44:55 for roblox in general
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:45:05 i remember seeing one that would let you join people with joins off
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:45:15 sounds like a tos violation though
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:46:42 what am i looking at
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:46:52 pretty sure i see some exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:47:40 you're telling me all of those motors work without lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:48:58 sometimes its needed for stability since motors die some times
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:24:03 im pretty sure the super run allows you to run through a blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:24:10 if you can attach it to you, you can try running in
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:24:25 or just lock it in

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:40:50 it may as well be empty
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:41:21 it doesn't matter at that point

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:47:25 i wonder why
the-dump 2023-01-05 03:56:45 no
the-dump 2023-01-09 02:53:55 imagine using "whitename" as insult, as if your colored name somehow puts you above everyone else
the-dump 2023-01-09 02:54:45 so having a different color name sets you above the people without a color right?
the-dump 2023-01-09 02:54:59 its not an argument
the-dump 2023-01-09 02:55:16 im just tired of people thinking that colors set them apart
the-dump 2023-01-09 02:55:39 *o k*
the-dump 2023-01-09 03:03:02 pcc already has
the-dump 2023-01-09 03:03:24 whitename is just what any colored name says when they are losing a fight

the-dump 2023-01-10 03:50:27 also did luvria have a shield pack
the-dump 2023-01-10 04:15:14 makes sense
the-dump 2023-01-10 04:15:57 should've used heavy rifle

plane-crazy 2023-01-12 22:42:51 anyone have a copy and paste for the emoji hexagon turrets
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:46:45 anyone know a way to make a laser thicker than bullets that still damages?
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:48:02 gravity + low damage are the main problems with that
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:48:47 well its gonna be the main feature of the build, so it should be capable of high damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:48:58 guns only weaken blocks and it takes forever to break one
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:49:44 that could probably do some damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:49:55 just a shame theres no good way of making lasers in pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:50:56 or a short range flak cannon
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:52:02 ive seen a few people do cosmetic ones

plane-crazy 2023-01-17 15:38:29 how in the heck do people make massive aircraft carriers fit on the plot

plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:09 i did a venator and the only way i could get it to fly is a lot of helium, wing panels, and ballast
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:24 just a ton of trial and error
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:42 anchor blocks is the best bet for that
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:00:11 anchor when you want to levitate, unanchor when you start moving again
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:01:32 smash or pass new one
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:02:00 yeah i had two sets of engine groups to level mine
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:02:25 ok what do i do to make it a hot babe
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:23 oh yeah the actual engines wont be enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:28 you're better off doing a hover drive
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:41 what to improve
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:53 its like 20 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:56 theres nothing to redo
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:05:28 the nose is custom angles
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:05:43 the build lines up to the blueprint almost perfectly
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:23:16 i spent so long trying to perfect the venator, and the day after i finish, roblox has a physics update
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:29:11 we should definitely meet up when you're done with that and have a battle
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:50:57 well its good enough for me
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:51:15 wasnt planning on putting it in creations so i should be good

plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:12:39 because discord users view a colorful string of letters as something of importance, due to the fact it is one of their very few accomplishments in life

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 16:06:08 following your mouse and constantly moving forward
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 16:07:35 1. the ship is already built
2. shredder bugs require 2 sections to not be attached
help 2023-01-18 16:13:21 is there anyway to get a large space ship to follow your mouse for steering? kinda like a shredder bug
help 2023-01-18 16:17:28 about 2 plots long and one plot high
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 16:42:25 and that is?
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 16:53:31 didnt see the image was replying to mine
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 16:53:56 i think the ship may be too big for that though

creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:43:09 planes do require (in my experience) much more motorlocking than ships
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:45:32 hate to break it to you, but you definitely came to the wrong place for constructive criticism. 97% of people are going to insult you and your build beyond comprehension, without actually being useful in the slightest

as you can see here
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:47:47 someone who doesnt play pc would give better advice then the people here
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:49:54 wdym face comments everyone here just asked him how he had expert and insulted everything about his build. theres a difference between facing criticism rather then outright insults and rudeness. you're the only person who has bothered to help him

plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:10:16 no just 42 year olds in their mothers basement
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:11:06 im pretty sure someone just got bullied for not being in a relationship at the age of 14
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:13:19 its pcc
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:13:36 if you arent older than a ds, you probably shouldnt be in a romantic relationship
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:55:19 but in pcc, they instead formed a ranked hierarchy of colored names, so the more "important" someone is, the less idiotic he thinks he is
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:55:37 when he infact is far more idiotic than the colorless ones
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:56:24 like from what i understand, they were harassing a kid for being smart and realizing he wasn't old enough yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:57:45 im sure their "relationship" is constantly trying to text a girl only to get ignored
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:58:07 anyone who uses the word "pull" in reference to relationships clearly isnt one
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:59:56 bros lives are like Seinfeld episodes, relationships only last 20 minutes
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 15:39:39 yo finally a smart person
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 15:39:47 bp is the worst thing you can do for accurate builds
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 15:40:04 not only does the cam have fov, but you will never be able to get a straight shot

the-dump 2023-04-07 03:15:26 i don't think thats why you shouldn't go near it
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:15:34 its a mentally insane wild animal
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:16:30 it should be logic to put as much distance between you and anything that looks like that as possible
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:01 do people actually believe those exists?
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:08 like i get its a joke and all
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:29 but their existence was likely mistaken for a prion disease victim
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:55 so glad i live in a place without that
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:24 honestly i don't blame them if i saw that id probably crap a brick too
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:40 i live in florida 😎
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:51 all the animals here already want to kill you
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:10 but at least they don't look like they would enjoy killing you
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:18 unlike that forsaken deer
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:38 80% of them will kill you if try
