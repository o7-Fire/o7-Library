plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:12 i only get pissed at the people that show off something that could change the community for ever but never have a tutorial or get good pics of it on purpose
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:43 not motolock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:54 ive seen plenty of things people would die to have
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:26:13 the only tutorial i will personally call out for treason are shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:26:20 otherwise tutorials are fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:26:40 shredders and the b-29s i see everywhere

plane-crazy 2021-03-09 11:41:36 oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:05:13 bruh it was a autosave
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:05:20 dont blame him
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:05:37 like blue is any better
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:07:26 isnt that discrimination
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:07:51 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:07:55 im just saying
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:08:02 the way you phrased that
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:09:29 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:09:50 some tryhards do
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:10:17 but we dont like to acknowledge their existence
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:10:27 obviously not you
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:10:43 if your truly dont care
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:10:47 then why do you respond
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:11:01 it had nothing to do with you
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:11:13 who said im taking seriously
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:11:31 i was just saying that the way he phrased that sounded a bit wrong
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:16:13 shisse
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:20:08 power it to imense speeds
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:20:14 then just let it run
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:20:41 keneitic energy
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:45:39 everything is possible in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:46:35 we thought something like motolock was impossible when the game first came out, now its standard everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:46:43 i think there is a way
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:52:47 RIP
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:50:29 does anybody know any copyscriptors?
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:51:00 does anybody know any copyscriptors
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:51:05 im not one myself
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:51:09 im just looking for some
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:51:48 i have some, "special revenge" for those who steal others builds
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:51:55 its unethical
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:52:08 the revenge, its harmless
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:57:08 if your really curios its a copy of my aircraft carrier that is not functional and has all sorts of annoying traps added in, so that when they try and unfold it, they get stuck in annoying traps and they will have their feathers ruffled.
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 18:53:54 i wake up and all i see if "is plane crazy dying"

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:52:57 does anyone know the best way to counter an aircraft just flipping in circles after take off?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:55:32 worked like a charm, thanks man
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:08:21 I fear for the future of this game, today I saw a server of people shitting on new players to game. I wonder how they think this game is gonna live if the community keeps driving noobs away
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:08:52 0-o
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:10:01 Tried, failed, got tired, went to McDonald‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:10:05 Rinse and repeat
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:10:26 Not exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:10:36 I know
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:11:37 No, it happened last night, after a couple minutes I just left the server cause I didn‚Äôt want to deal with their shit. If I can find their names I‚Äôll give them to you
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:11:48 I‚Äôll try to retrace my steps
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:12:50 Tbh, the current noobs are the ones that will be inventing the next motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:13:10 Just like how our generation of noobs ended up creating motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:15:17 This is exactly the plot of cars 3 if you look at it
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:15:23 But continue on
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:16:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:18:50 RIP Internet
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:19:42 2x4 blocks need to exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:20:00 Well
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:20:11 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:23:30 Yea, anything can work as a long as you can sit down and say,‚Äùok where did I go wrong‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:23:46 Otherwise you just give up and make another tutorial bomber and go to pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:24:35 Motivation only works in big amounts. For me I get super pumped up start building and then just run out
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:25:13 I use the hall of fame for inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:25:18 And motivation
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:25:47 That‚Äôs exactly what happened to my enterprise. Now she lies forgotten in my save box
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:25:56 Sad little build
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:26:39 Aircraft carriers are easier than normal ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:26:50 You only have to build half way up then just flat
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:28:57 Wrong chat
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:29:02 .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:32:03 Shower thought: at some point, motor lock will become the basics of plane crazy. Maybe even in the tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 12:32:26 *yet*
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:53:33 Can‚Äôt wait for someone to use magnet lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:55:18 So how is everyone today
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:55:32 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:55:40 Correct answer was fucking depressed
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:55:43 You failed
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 00:42:05 That looks good
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 00:42:55 Who said I was trying to get rid of it for good?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 14:20:54 What‚Äôs up with this update?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 14:21:09 He didn‚Äôt change the change log so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs new .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 14:22:31 Anybody?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 14:22:42 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 14:48:32 Looks like an elongated spitfire or a D-9 Fulke Wolf
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 14:49:01 I hate being a nerd
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 14:49:41 I would guess BF-109 or a 140

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 12:26:30 Is it bad that I still don‚Äôt know what the purpose of magnets are?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 12:27:15 I get that but when I try to treat them like normal magnets they spaz out of control
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 12:27:32 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 12:27:42 Magnet lock would be fun
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 19:16:38 Has anyone built the zumwalt class?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 19:16:53 Atleast anyone here
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 19:17:43 Is it a 2 fold or a 3
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 19:18:53 Ah, never mind
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 12:19:57 What is the general consensus on a guild/nation system being implemented?
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 12:20:38 Ex: 4 different nations you can join and there will be a competitive match game mode and at the end of every month a winner is chosen
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 12:20:51 That‚Äôs just an example
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 12:23:05 So no nation/guilds/clans but just a way to create collaborative teams of people
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 14:17:29 Does anybody have an iowa they are willing to share pictures of?

plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:37:43 63 not 43
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:39:04 The Wisconsin
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:40:19 Anyways ima go die now
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:48:12 You need something to connect the 2 top motor mods with each other
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:48:22 like tnt or cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:04 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:11 See if that works
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:52 My brains hurts
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:50:20 Um
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:50:26 No?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:50:31 Give me more context
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:52:05 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 00:39:19 height increase when?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 15:58:50 üêí
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 15:59:06 Fight me dyno
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:01:31 It makes it so that instead of making the things that the helium is attached to lights it makes the helium block itself lighter
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:01:57 No no Germany or NO no Germany
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:02:00 There are two
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:02:28 So the NO no Germany. Alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:02:52 DM a mod
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:03:16 If they are in game then you can‚Äôt do anything about it
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:03:30 If it‚Äôs in the Discord then it‚Äôs a bigger issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:04:07 Thousands of people play plane crazy I doubt they have to time to ban people with no no signs
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:06:00 Bruh, there is the no no sign
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:06:21 Yes that no no sign
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:06:32 But your shooting *at* it
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:06:36 So I guess it‚Äôs fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:08:09 Make stuff heavy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:08:22 By changing the density you can make things heavier or lighter
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:08:52 However the block itself is heavy not the things it‚Äôs connected to. Like adding a weight to something
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:09:15 If your plane is constantly tilting up just put a ballast block up front to balance it out
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:09:24 DC-10
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 16:09:52 Look at me Look at me, I am the only vote

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 12:06:57 Like did you use piston lock, motorlock, both?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 12:07:36 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 12:07:58 I‚Äôll just have to figure it out
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:46:32 If someone could build this I would say color me impressed

plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:22:05 Die lange Stille macht mir Angst
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:25:42 Too long of a fold
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:25:49 Also folds should only be 1 motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:25:52 Not two
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:26:23 Still you only need 1 motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:26:38 2 just make it so that the food intercounters itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:26:49 Still
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:27:18 Wait is that motor connecting the peice on the left powered?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:27:30 The one at the base of the left peice
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:27:37 That‚Äôs your problem then
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:28:01 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:28:40 But yea, the two motors facing down are gonna cancel each other out
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:29:13 Reguardless of which way they turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:34:55 Looks great
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:35:09 But with some motor locking you could make it look top tier
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:37:36 Akso make the tracks a little less big
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:38:00 Like by a block and it would look more accurate, besides that good job
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 01:42:35 You should still cut off your arm
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 11:21:18 Hm still no warn
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 11:21:28 Guess it didn‚Äôt matter as much as they thought it did
