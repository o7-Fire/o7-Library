help 2020-06-01 19:03:47 Dunno if it was a recent update or what, but all of my 5x5 cylinders cars ride bumpy as hell now. This had recently started happening to my friend to. I took a closer look at the cylinders and they look like they are not round anymore, and only have maybe 13-17 sides. Why? What was wrong with cylinders beforehand? Why were they changed?
help 2020-06-01 20:12:41 But I would rather sacrifice a miniscule amount of performance for a nice, smooth ride quality than improve performance a tiny amount making my rear axle litterally smash itself into the upper wheel wells two times a second
help 2020-06-01 20:13:10 bro my AMC Javelin plays pingpong against the top of the wheel wells and the ground when I go full speed now
help 2020-06-01 20:13:35 literally not worth the performance improvement whatsoever
help 2020-06-01 20:13:52 I hope rickje sees this and reverts all cylinders back to what they were before

In one of these "Performance Improvement" Updates, the devs made cylinders have less sides and more blocky. Ride quality in any of my cars, and even barebones chassis is shit now. Really puts my triangulated 4 link live axle chassis to work absorbing all the bumps.
general 2020-06-01 23:03:19 we really need to find a way to show the problems with the updated cylinders
general 2020-06-01 23:03:27 everyone's cars bounce now

general 2020-09-11 07:01:32 4x4 cylinders yes
general 2020-09-11 07:01:56 1.5 blocks? isn't that just a block with a half block on top
general 2020-09-11 07:02:26 we need quarter blocks
general 2020-09-11 07:03:00 rickje are 4x4 cylinders a possibility
general 2020-09-11 07:03:36 we have 1x1,2x2,3x3, but then it skips to 5x5
general 2020-09-11 07:03:48 would adding 4x4 cylinders be possible

creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:07:32 do you see the sides with the fins
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:07:41 that required a two-layer motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:07:45 on the sides of the car
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:07:47 the giant fins

help 2020-09-12 01:12:40 <@!720751430595772418> If you set a motor to unpowered and lock, when you spawn in, it will pull everything attached to the motor shaft into the motor by half a block and allows the blocks attached to phase through unconnected ones

creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:13:56 ahh I see

help 2020-09-12 01:14:53 I'm not very good with aircraft modeling so I may not be of help
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:15:28 I've made a working camshaft with a chain but deleted it cause I was too lazy to make the crankshaft and complete the engine
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:16:16 there's so much friction involved with the camlobes moving the valves up and down that keep it perfectly timed using a chain is pretty much impossible unless you like
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:16:42 make little protrusions of the chain to follow the sprockets
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:17:07 Explosions don't actually have propulsion physics
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:17:16 They just destroy blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:17:43 Yeah I had a friend make that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:17:47 it was really cool
creations-chat 2020-09-12 01:18:00 I think <@!479298992874979328> made one

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 16:14:33 I like using cutter cannons
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 16:15:35 but if you have a shotgun type at close range, it is more than effective
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 16:15:38 which I use them for
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 16:16:03 cutter cannons do work very well
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 16:16:09 but have short operating ranges

creations-chat 2020-09-23 08:50:09 The turret in the back can swivel between positions from the top and the back
creations-chat 2020-09-23 08:51:09 no, but I can try. I originally had the rims slightly larger but even with an optimal steering pivot it would still hit the fender flare
creations-chat 2020-09-23 08:54:41 it looks like the top of the tail has quite a long flat section on the real plane
creations-chat 2020-09-23 08:54:50 but you curved off the top
creations-chat 2020-09-23 08:56:13 yeah some half wedge 2s might help

bot-central 2020-10-02 04:56:26 !help
bot-central 2020-10-02 04:56:42 ?suggesthelp
general 2020-10-02 19:12:13 I don't even know what to think of equations anymore
general 2020-10-02 19:12:36 Because they are now beyond simple tasks
general 2020-10-02 19:13:27 After getting into differential equations and statics with forces in equilibrium everything below is a cakewalk
general 2020-10-02 19:14:34 which word
general 2020-10-02 19:14:51 statics is a hard class
general 2020-10-02 19:15:39 
general 2020-10-02 19:15:43 here's an example problem
general 2020-10-02 19:16:01 when doing moment you have to so soo many cross products
general 2020-10-02 19:16:10 so many determinants of 3x3 matrices
general 2020-10-02 19:17:00 saying something is in equilibrium means the net force acting upon the object is zero
general 2020-10-02 19:17:31 therefore the object stays at rest or if it's moving at a constant velocity, it will stay a constant velocity
general 2020-10-02 19:18:00 it's in equilibrium because the force of the bed (normal force) exerted upon it due to gravity makes it stay at rest
general 2020-10-02 19:19:24 In equilibrium you can have many things interfering with it but they all have to cancel each other out
general 2020-10-02 19:19:58 No
general 2020-10-02 19:20:16 As many things interfering with it as you want
general 2020-10-02 19:20:25 but they all have to cancel each other out
general 2020-10-02 19:20:32 yes
general 2020-10-02 21:01:56 No, start with making multilink

the-dump 2020-10-09 09:08:45 
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:09:29 I don't really mind them either
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:10:33 50% of the cars at drag strips are guaranteed foxbody mustangs
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:11:29 I really wanna build my 'stang handling-oriented. It does great in straight lines, so why do I need it to go faster in straight lines?
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:12:11 I'd say mustangs and camaros are breakeven
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:12:39 I don't think you know about the halfshafts on irs camaros snapping when you add power
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:13:55 I see that the coyote is more expensive because of its dual vvti system along with its 4 valve design, but it's not really that way anymore
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:14:17 I will say however that there are some faults with the gen 3 coyote motors
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:14:34 You get either at around the same price lol

general 2020-10-28 05:55:31 <@!645128367611445248> Double wishbone with a third totally fucking pointless wishbone on top. Not only does this do absolutely nothing to benefit the suspension, it also restricts the ability of creating  camber and complicates creating a caster angle. It is simply a 12 year old's idea of flexing with "complex suspension"

general 2020-11-03 19:40:28 everyone is freaking out in my server
general 2020-11-03 19:43:07 I bet it's just a bug or glitch, everyone stop fucking freaking out that motorlock is "fixed" cause rickje already said he wants to keep it as feature of the game
general 2020-11-03 19:43:30 bruh moment
general 2020-11-03 20:26:52 motorlock has been perfectly fine up until today when he decided to just immediately stop working for no reason
general 2020-11-03 20:27:56 I'm pretty sure it's something that roblox did to fuck with game code and broke a couple things on possibly multiple games and not just PC
general 2020-11-03 20:32:05 It's not just motorlock, it's the whole function of locking on the motor. The lock mechanic broke so it's definitely just a bug
general 2020-11-03 20:33:30 <@!746022074216218625> Yes just tested ingame. There is no sign of that "snapping" that the lock does to set its orientation

general 2020-12-13 08:10:17 interesting
general 2020-12-13 08:10:30 have attempted any other types of suspension yet
general 2020-12-13 08:12:06 So far I've made double wishbone,  macpherson strut, semi trailing arm, 3 link solid axle, 4 link solid axle (parallel links with panhard bar,) and 4 link triangulated

general 2020-12-13 08:13:39 My laptop is put away since I'm on vacay but I can try to remember to show you when I have an opportunity maybe the day after tomorrow
general 2020-12-13 08:14:26 I don't have any pictures or videos saved of my suspension because they would just show messiness and not much clarity in functionality with out description
general 2020-12-13 08:14:36 but I need to get to it
general 2020-12-13 08:15:11 my latest fun task was creating 3 link for my front and rear axles on my land rover discovery
general 2020-12-13 08:15:32 perhaps
general 2020-12-13 08:18:36 Traditional pushrod has the struts somewhat parallel to the ground as shown
general 2020-12-13 08:19:32 cantilever pushrod is quite fun to make and I recommend as a next attenpt
general 2020-12-13 08:19:40 unless you already have
general 2020-12-13 08:20:28 very quirky suspension
general 2020-12-13 08:20:36 you are correct
general 2020-12-13 08:21:38 multilink is the ultimate form of independent suspension in complexity
general 2020-12-13 08:22:26 for real
general 2020-12-13 08:23:11 especially when trying to angle the linkss and making them the right length; I just use motorlock to get them to angles that seem right
general 2020-12-13 08:23:19 haven't touched it in a while
general 2020-12-13 08:26:35 Lmao my first multilink had all the links flat. It got the job done but was a pretty noob way to make multilink
general 2020-12-13 08:28:03 my second attempt was to make it more realistic with the different length links and angle. The problem I ran into was the clearance of the strut in between all four links and how short the links were causing the suspension to easily hyperextend with the joints reversing themselves
general 2020-12-13 08:29:29 second attempt was incorporating that long trailing-arm-like bottom rear link as well as some form of a positive caster angle
general 2020-12-13 08:31:29 eh
general 2020-12-13 08:32:00 got the same kinda "yikes" feeling
general 2020-12-13 08:32:47 some person from pcc wanted to add me to use me to help them make a differential or something
general 2020-12-13 08:33:45 in discord dms they tried to accuse me of trying to "get on them" or some stupidass shit out of legit nowhere

creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:47:17 if a build looks even mediocre it will get downvotes, that's just the way it is *Bruce Hornsby intensifies*

creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:54:25 If someone likes something, do they need to give all the reasons of why they like it?
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:56:52 A downvote doesn't always mean they hate it, and that logic should be able to work both ways. No one is obligated to share what they like nor what they don't about a build

general 2021-01-16 09:16:59 Suspension tuning is definitely a pain in the ass
general 2021-01-16 09:17:24 Putting a toggled piston where the springs are definitely helps a lot with damping, and ropes prevent your suspension from hyperextending into the next new age yoga pose
general 2021-01-16 09:18:08 works miracles, you should try it
general 2021-01-16 09:18:23 what is your method

general 2021-01-16 09:19:29 LMAO that's funny as hell
general 2021-01-16 09:20:09 you realize doing that kind of cheats the suspension with the downward facing hovers reducing the normal force
general 2021-01-16 09:20:40 the downward facing ONES are still doing that

creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:58:03 Very good point you make. Single color rich blacks are hard to make since its easy to make it turn into a blob, and if too dull looks like a dark gray. I wonder if PC2 will have new reflective block customization
creations-chat 2021-11-05 18:00:40 Yeah, currently it's like reddish/orangish black in some light. But <@!529716042113744906> foil and ice are pretty awful materials to use on large flat surfaces. Foil is good for small details butll make an entire thing look like it went through a hailstorm. Also thanks for the input <@!588596347272167456>

general 2022-12-28 04:17:06 wow this server really be dead
general 2022-12-28 04:20:20 I will not miss out on my free mcdonald's rewards
general 2022-12-28 04:21:24 bruger proteen make me lif stronk
general 2022-12-28 04:23:41 not sure what you meen
general 2022-12-28 04:24:35 damn how much bacon grease you chuggin big boy?
general 2022-12-28 04:25:54 as long as your caloric intake is within reasoning you're completely fine. plan out your protein intake then balance out your carbs and fats
general 2022-12-28 04:27:09 it's true, blood cholestrol depends solely upon caloric intake and burning, not food cholesterol; but I do agree with you that fast food items are little calorie bombs
general 2022-12-28 04:27:34 beans beans and beans
general 2022-12-28 04:28:15 but 1 Joule plus 1 Joule equals 2 Joules
general 2022-12-28 04:28:29 you're still alive too?
general 2022-12-28 04:29:09 so we just had a rare moment of you unearthing yourself from under the rock
general 2022-12-28 04:29:55 yep and is why I do not understand those keto trendy videos of people eating ungodly amounts of avocado and bacon
general 2022-12-28 04:30:36 actually both are saturated fats
general 2022-12-28 04:33:16 yeah but in the bigger picture going over your caloric intake regardless of calories source will lead to weight gain rather comping or cutting (which is fine if you are bulking though)
general 2022-12-28 04:34:58 I originally came to see if the overly round European developer put a little more thought into the 2nd coming of this game with more progress updates but apparently my search ran dry. But I did enjoy our convo about food

general 2023-01-23 21:50:50 same
general 2023-01-23 21:52:19 I made a f3x spaceship and it was so accurate that is was kinda boring to build. Like if you know what you're doing you just spend a bunch of time perfectly placing bricks in space. There is no challenge, no motorlock skeleton needed to be built. I can see it turning you lifeless really fast
general 2023-01-23 21:53:22 I think the build resizing would be really cool. I can then downscale my 5x5 cars into something lookin crazy on playerscale
general 2023-01-23 21:53:50 nothing will get overrune, I think old building styles will still perfectly work
general 2023-01-23 21:54:38 massive bonus I agree
general 2023-01-23 21:55:18 softcoding needed to happen regardless of resize or not. we all want larger plots and different maps, as well as more frequent updates which will only come with pc2
general 2023-01-23 21:59:17 your builds are already absolutely top notch, I could see resizing helping you with some stuff cause I'd hate to see what your lock towers look like unspawned
general 2023-01-23 22:00:00 until?
general 2023-01-23 22:03:05 no
general 2023-01-23 22:03:31 I hope it doesnt spread to my area that shit sucks
general 2023-01-23 22:03:57 maybe in pc2 they'll finally fix half piston locking
general 2023-01-23 22:07:39 yeah nothing worse than piston rubberbanding when trying load

plane-crazy 2023-01-24 00:29:01 I'm not familiar with wing panel nose

plane-crazy 2023-01-24 00:34:45 just gotta do the nose, canopy and make the tailfins straight instead of angled
