help 2022-01-26 16:25:46 how would i do the gun for the hstvl?
help 2022-01-26 16:26:54 alright
help 2022-01-26 17:40:09 its going to be quite a small gun as the vehicle itself is fairly small
help 2022-01-26 17:40:39 as of now the hull is far from completion and i still need to cram in a few details
help 2022-01-26 18:39:02 do you mean something like this
help 2022-01-26 18:39:23 with how the engines are integrated into the wing?
help 2022-01-26 18:40:12 so what plane are you currently working on
help 2022-01-26 18:40:25 wing shape depends on the plane
