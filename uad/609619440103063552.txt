creations-chat 2021-01-03 23:16:01 well roblox is stupid so i cant really say 9 or nine

bug-reports 2021-01-03 23:28:24 ive been using this *thing* for a bit now and i would like it to be addressed as i found something more interesting while playing around with it yesterday, not only can you go at more than the speed of light, but you can use the mech that i used to get this fast to also get into blacklisted plots (granted they are adjacent to yours)
bug-reports 2021-01-03 23:33:41 
bug-reports 2021-01-03 23:34:12 if you are blacklisted on an adjacent plot, you can use the arm (without the parachuted character) to glitch inside and well
bug-reports 2021-01-03 23:34:16 walk in an illegal plot

bug-reports 2021-01-04 00:01:44 sounds like a you problem lmfao
bug-reports 2021-01-04 00:05:19 also maybe just have pitch, yaw, and roll to be non-camera activated like servos instead (they work better for me most times anyways)
bug-reports 2021-01-04 00:05:54 also another bug: motor 2 servos just spaz out under a lot of pressure or friction
bug-reports 2021-01-04 03:04:28 i kinda tried to kidnap them and take them to brazil
creations-chat 2021-01-04 19:40:04 it works quite nicely but i want it better (the main goal of the build was to be as pure as possible so no cameras)
