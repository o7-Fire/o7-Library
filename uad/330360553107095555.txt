creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:20:57 Y-wing from Star Wars (consisting of 365 blocks)
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:22:43 Thanks for the tips
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:26:02 It took me a long time to choose an Y-wing from the Republic or Rebellion so I tried my best making it like a hybrid, because the Y-wing from the Republic was really hard to make due to it's shape
creations-chat 2018-10-26 02:08:19 Made from a part of the Longest Aircraft Carrier that was posted by my friend a while ago, and built into a smaller aircraft carrier (1008 blocks)
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:55:50 P-47 Thunderbolt with retractable landing gear (548 blocks)
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 13:02:34 Why didn't I get the ranks of: Sea Marshal and M E G A C A R R I E R? Because the ship in the video that Rauf44 posted in <#504436696021204992> was part my ship.
creations-chat 2018-10-26 14:03:30 Can I get the Ace Pilot rank for this?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 14:13:41 Can I get Ace Pilot for this then? (for some reason the plane is shaking a lot but I guess it's a vertical climb)
creations-chat 2018-10-26 14:32:44 Multi-stage rocket (speed of 600+)
creations-chat 2018-10-26 15:24:18 Can I get Bombardier?

creations-chat 2018-12-15 00:07:06 My attempt at making The Malevolence from Star Wars (3700+ blocks. Doesn't fly quite well, trying to improve)
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 20:44:41 Do you guys think that my F-22 Raptor is copied from or looks like Fish Tank's F-22 Raptor, because everytime I Ioad it in on a server there's always someone that says I "copied" from Fish Tank, even though I try to deny it, they won't believe me.
