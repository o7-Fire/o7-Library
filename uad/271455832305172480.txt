The Tale of hugstoaknifefight (271455832305172480)
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:12:04 My tank just withstood 10 rockets, a shredder bug attack, a boat load of bullets and was still functional
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 05:35:58 Somehow it's still operational.

I don't know how.
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 05:36:33 not much
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 05:42:21 also I don't think I have to say that the tank in the pic has seen better days
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 06:20:23 but is it as immortal as my tank?

bot-central 2021-01-17 06:21:05 &suggest <Nerfing Cutter Blocks
[PVP]
One may ask, "Why would you want to nerf cutter blocks?" And for my answer, 2 words: *Shredder bugs.*
To the 2 people in this server who don't know what shredder bugs are, they're creations that can fly incredibly fast and use cutter blocks to decimate creations in a matter of seconds. There's very few ways to counter these, hence why I'm trying to nerf cutter blocks, as they rely on them.
I have a few ways to nerf cutter blocks, listed below:
1. Add a block that cannot be destroyed by cutter blocks, but would still be vunerable to other weapons, that you can only place a few of in each creation.
2. Make cutter blocks have a limit to how many blocks they can destroy.
3. Make cutter blocks take some time to destroy a block, the same way guns can't instantly destroy blocks.>
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:23:04 excuse me w h a t
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:23:56 ***P O N G***
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:24:18 what rank do i need
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:24:56 where do i get ranks
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:26:02 got a rank, now what
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:26:29 yea i do
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:26:43 i have verified, dev updates, and events
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:27:45 well den
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:28:11 can you copy my suggestion and input it yourself and just give me credit?
bot-central 2021-01-17 06:29:31 like add "Credit to <@!271455832305172480> for suggestion idea" at the bottom
bot-central 2021-01-29 01:05:19 &suggest An item search. This appear as a bar next to the materials button in the build tab, and it would search categories (as in like the "Half Blocks", "Helium Blocks" or "Wedges" categories). That's about it.

plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:49:22 i made a plane that can fly upside down
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:49:41 it doesn't seem possible but i don't know enough about aviation to dispute it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:51:00 i made a tutorial plane and added 3 turrets on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:51:31 well ik how to counter shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:51:45 make everything at least 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:52:02 then the blocks won't collapse and allow the cutter to get into the build
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:03 also i have a tank that can survive:
-1 shredder bug attack
-10 rockets
-a boat load of bullets
and remain functional afterward
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:13 and they're like norm wheels
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:15 but 360
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:36 snow pipe is smoke pipe but snow rather than smoke
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:47 and snow wheel[i think] has more traction
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:53:51 idk
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:56:04 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:56:47 Also if you have a plane with turrets then I suggest using keyboard control for the control panel
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:56:52 And ik some
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:57:26 https://youtu.be/hAlDs5372iU
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:57:35 Yea, rockets
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:58:01 https://youtu.be/iip1b2k7XG0
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:58:26 Also you can turn off the homing on rockets
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:58:44 Also I have a few turret designs you can copy
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:59:05 Yea that's possible
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:59:36 Also I suggest setting the TNT block to impact toggle
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:59:38 Also
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:59:40 ***NO***

plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:01:33 Well rule 1: don't use shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:01:50 Spaced armor isn't a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:02:03 It attracts your blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:02:09 But only your blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:02:42 I once tried to make a magnet shield but that's how I learned that it only works on your blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:03:04 A *what*
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:04:01 
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:04:44 Well unless the armor is 5 blocks thick, **no.**
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:05:33 Then a cutter bug will fly right through it.
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:06:13 But magnets don't work on other people
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:06:40 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:07:03 I will
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:07:15 Alr
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:07:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:07:39 But it's delayed
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:08:28 Again
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:09:33 Well thar
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:10:02 If it involves cutters

***No***
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:10:29 Well I'ma make my tank 5 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:11:00 Make a turret
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:11:21 **Make a turret**
