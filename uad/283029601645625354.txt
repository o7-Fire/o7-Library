creations-chat 2021-09-26 03:57:28 funny paint scheme
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:25:54 wip falken, thoughts? (super thrusters in the back are temporary, just wanted to see how well it would fly in this state)
help 2021-09-26 18:29:50 aight so this build of mine has angled wing panels to make the shape of the nose, but as a result there's a severe uncontrollable yaw. ive had this issue before and couldn't figure out how to fix it without removing the angled panels entirely. any ideas?
help 2021-09-26 18:30:16 <#504436696021204992>
help 2021-09-26 18:34:10 tested and found out even without the angled panels it still has an uncontrollable yaw reeeee
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:34:59 what is that plane supposed to be
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:39:36 leading edge of wings needs to be more angled, the wings in general are poorly shaped and quite a bit big, they need to be moved back along with the vertical stabilizers and the elevators. paint scheme also needs work, and the body of the aircraft in general is a bit fat

at the end of the day it's your choice, im not saying you should delete and restart but you can if you want to
help 2021-09-26 18:47:13 funny thing is my plane is much more stable yaw wise when flying backwards
help 2021-09-26 18:47:54 too much effort
help 2021-09-26 18:48:38 not what im going for
help 2021-09-26 18:48:46 i need this thing to be stable flying forwards
help 2021-09-26 18:51:48 figured out a solution on my own, no need for help anymore E
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:52:45 did you see a mess of motor locks when it was despawned?

creations-chat 2021-09-26 19:39:59 the black circles on my plane are emojis, so i guess yeah you can find emojis through searching google

creations-chat 2021-09-28 01:59:06 <@!721908663694131281> man im working on a falken yours looks 10x better than mine lmaoo

good build btw, like it a lot even if it doens't perform well enough for you
still though that's like insignificant considering the rest of your build
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:07:36 idk how i feel now, might work on another different AC aircraft lmao
was originally thinking about posting mine once i finished E
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:09:45 I was originally thinking about making the CFA, might be worth a shot
still might post my falken tho, it's gonna take like another week to figure out the engines anyway

creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:16:03 ooo also a good one, keeping that one in mind as well lmao
