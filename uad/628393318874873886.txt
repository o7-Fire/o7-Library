plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:16:43 im new to single rotor helis, and i am aware that the heli spins with single rotors sometimes, but how would i make this setup work for my hind without it spinning like crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:18:44 ive seen many helis made using single rotors, and most of them actually work. is there some sort of counter torque that stops the spinning?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:19:01 besides the tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 01:46:01 has this drive already been invented? it can go aprox 10k speed if it is going straight
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 01:59:41 well, its like a conveyor drive on steroids, so i guess
bug-reports 2020-04-03 21:50:19 i built a heli, and this happened to the motors. at first, i spawned it, it worked fine, i despawned, didn't touch anything, and then it happened. im not to sure what is causing it, but it happens on all of my builds using this format
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 21:21:26 it is in beta <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:34:20 we got 6.3k!!
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:34:43 probably the newest record
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:01 its the invisible glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:49:05 wait wut? how did people get these awards yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:49:42 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:52:20 one simple upgrade to my F-20, and its hovering just doubled in quality
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:53:38 a few more slight upgrades and i might  be able to get it to stay still, instead of moving around a few blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:35 aaannd i got it!
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 02:01:06 here it is. the hovering jet. it does it twice, once at the beginning, once at the end
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:15:41 idk what happened
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:15:44 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:16:12 apparently, chairs have a super high amount of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:16:46 they can barely move when i try and move them
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:21:07 see. the chairs are at unnecessarily high levels of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:27:38 /nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:27:43 the chair moves
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:28:02 there is no weld on the sides of the chairs
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:28:19 yup
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:30:49 see, they dont weld, but they have ridiculously high amounts of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:32:01 its made a huge difference to everything i make with an ejector seat
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:32:30 ive spent literally 5 hours trying to get it to work on my current plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:53:36 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:15:33 despite the countless bugs and glitches, the lighting has proved its worth to me. it really added some more realism to this.

help 2020-05-20 16:03:58 can someone help me make landing gear that doesnt flop around?
help 2020-05-20 16:04:09 i need to use motor 2 to make it tho
help 2020-05-20 16:04:41 too little torque makes it not able to retract, but a little to much and the gear has a siezure
help 2020-05-20 16:04:54 and even still, the gear flops around
help 2020-05-20 16:11:47 ill show you the motions it needs to do
help 2020-05-20 16:16:17 here, also, notice the shaking in the end. this is barely enough power to retract the gear, and it STILL gets a small siezure
help 2020-05-20 16:19:41 even at 1000 torque it doesnt have enough power to function properly
help 2020-05-20 16:19:46 when in the air
help 2020-05-20 16:24:26 can someone explain to me why the motors do whatever they want, and how to fix it?
help 2020-05-20 16:25:20 because now, one side retracts normally, but the left side retracts BACKWARDS, even when its on the ground, it goes normally

bug-reports 2020-11-04 18:39:45 dont have footage yet, but the motorlock fixes seem to reduce hover drive speed, cause huge lag when spawning in, and when other people go fast, they seem to be going at 10FPS, while they are not lagging at all
bug-reports 2020-11-04 21:43:21 oh, and sometimes motorlock also has a habit of not locking for other players, or sometimes just stays floating at spawn while the part with the pilot seat moves on

bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:33 vip servers will keep teleporting you to the waiting place after a few minutes
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:50 doesnt matter that they are already updated
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:57 they will always kick you out
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:29:57 also sometimes you get teleported to an un-updated server
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:44:35 waited in one public server for 10 min after being teleported there and it has not updated yet
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:45:23 in the meantime my alt has been teleported after just a few minutes on an already updated private server

creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:22:35 which of these wing vapors looks better?
creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:42:40 how does this one look as well
creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:51:40 its sad that wing panels have too much drag to let you pull a lot of alpha
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:07:18 custom flaps, too lazy to fill in the edges just yet
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:09:33 tried them when I first built it but they just didn't give it the same agility as custom
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:12:19 I could just fill it in with trails

creations-chat 2022-07-28 18:53:57 mods probably dont even care at this point
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:26:50 if you save a sign with "Status: Boarding" on it and then load it again it deletes ": Boarding"
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:27:38 doesnt just happen with that phrase
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:28:06 lots of sign things have started vanishing when saving
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:30:12 it looks like the sign is unable to save the : and anything after it
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:30:52 using a ; just makes the sign revert to default text
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:33:22 using : or ; could also make the text size tiny when loading again

help 2022-08-27 21:43:10 is there an easy way to make this outer grey square able to slide up and down the inner white square
help 2022-08-27 21:43:43 when its locked in like this the outer square clips the inner one for some reason and that pretty much renders it useless
help 2022-08-27 21:49:38 this is what the inner one is (1 square=1 block)
help 2022-08-28 14:07:08 is there a way to have a disconnector touching the top of a half block without it clipping into the half block?
help 2022-08-28 14:07:58 it always does this when locked which is what im trying to avoid
help 2022-08-28 14:15:43 the clipping
help 2022-08-28 14:16:02 you can see on both parts the disconnector is inside of the half block
