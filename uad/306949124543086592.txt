The Tale of 404notfound6081 (306949124543086592)
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:55:03 I've created a plane, clicked to go to the Arena, and now i can't load it anymore
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:55:27 It simply doesn't load
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:56:10 Yea, but, how can i get my plane back?
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:56:47 Yea
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:56:59 Exactly.
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:22 This happened after i've clicked the arena button
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:33 Yea, that's what i'm thinking.
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:55:27 So, is it safe to enter the arena now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 17:58:52 Pro tip: Do not open your parachute in high speeds
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:04:28 Maybe XD
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:04:44 I mean, should this apply?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:05:19 'Cause everything I did was to open my chute in a freefall
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:06:45 Well, it says "Using any means necessary"
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:06:56 So I may try for it xD
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 18:08:00 Actually, it would be Escape Velocity
