general 2022-12-30 22:11:23 Apparently people want to screw everyone over by making PC2 run on narrow gauge train tracks.

general 2022-12-30 22:11:42 Why must they do this?
general 2022-12-30 22:12:06 They're too small if anything
general 2022-12-30 22:12:41 Standard gauge irl has about 5 feet between rails
general 2022-12-30 22:14:06 And my train, which is huge, will now just tip over with the slightest curves
general 2022-12-30 22:15:26 My train has a capacity of about 115 people, do you want to kill 115 people?
general 2022-12-30 22:15:43 Including a boyscout troop?
general 2022-12-30 22:17:11 Besides, if your too lazy to build a train to fit the track, then you should stick to your tutorial mechs
general 2022-12-30 22:18:17 Yes, they are in real life
general 2022-12-30 22:18:28 Ever been to chicago?
general 2022-12-30 22:18:35 On a metra train?
general 2022-12-30 22:19:00 They're wider than 2 people lying down
general 2022-12-30 22:19:24 Yes, they are
general 2022-12-30 22:20:41 My train has two seats on either side of the 3 block aisle, and only two floors
general 2022-12-30 22:21:13 those three blocks make it possible to walk on the train
general 2022-12-30 22:21:42 otherwise you'd be jumping from seat to seat
general 2022-12-30 22:22:09 That's a subway
general 2022-12-30 22:22:18 Not a metra
general 2022-12-30 22:22:36 Standard gauge rails
general 2022-12-30 22:22:47 Train sizes vary
general 2022-12-30 22:23:19 There
general 2022-12-30 22:23:43 The seats can fit a person laying down
general 2022-12-30 22:24:09 Not true
general 2022-12-30 22:24:14 Ragdoll
general 2022-12-30 22:24:26 just press R bro
general 2022-12-30 22:24:54 Go into fpv then turn until it's right
general 2022-12-30 22:25:50 Anyway, this update will cause everyone's train builds to not work as intended
general 2022-12-30 22:26:14 Yes
general 2022-12-30 22:26:46 try reducing your foot length by 2 inches, how easy is it to stay upright?
general 2022-12-30 22:27:29 Still stands, or should I say doesn't
general 2022-12-30 22:28:43 Are you online in pc right now?
general 2022-12-30 22:29:18 Get on, I'll join you and show you my train and the problems it will have
general 2022-12-30 22:30:26 And yet, you haven't made a train fly with vtol
general 2022-12-30 22:32:05 https://streamable.com/5y41az
general 2022-12-30 22:33:26 You do know that that's like 4 blocks wider than the tracks, right?
general 2022-12-30 22:33:48 to scale would be one or two
general 2022-12-30 22:35:05 Yes, it is, the wheels are just huge
general 2022-12-30 22:35:57 How many blocks are the diameter?
general 2022-12-30 22:36:35 I'm guessing 3 blocks
general 2022-12-30 22:36:46 Yeah
general 2022-12-30 22:36:54 That's enormous
general 2022-12-30 22:37:19 The standard train wheels in the game are 2 blocks in diameter
general 2022-12-30 22:37:56 Still
general 2022-12-30 22:38:09 But the same width
general 2022-12-30 22:38:43 you don't need 2, unless they're the middle "blind" drivers
general 2022-12-30 22:39:38 Ok, one moment
general 2022-12-30 22:48:52 What is that supposed to mean?
general 2022-12-30 22:50:01 It is the same width as the outside of the tracks
general 2022-12-30 22:51:13 You know what, honestly
general 2022-12-30 22:51:30 I think you might actually be right
general 2022-12-30 22:51:55 Maybe I just never questioned the track width
general 2022-12-30 22:52:48 At this point it's "if pc2 comes out
general 2022-12-30 22:53:41 Sorry for my abstinence, by the way

general 2023-01-31 15:40:51 Have you tried Halo?
general 2023-01-31 15:41:56 There's your problem! go play now
general 2023-01-31 15:44:40 "Hey kid, want some candy? Get in the van if you do."
general 2023-01-31 15:45:47 In this server, we all in ohio
general 2023-01-31 15:49:00 Ayo bro, chill
general 2023-01-31 15:49:18 They ain't never gonna release it
general 2023-01-31 15:50:14 We all have, but that's no reason to turn this channel into chaos! Smh
general 2023-01-31 15:50:55 He did literally rick roll us
general 2023-01-31 15:51:12 What's roscale?
general 2023-01-31 15:51:45 Of what build?
general 2023-01-31 15:52:19 I'm so confused
general 2023-01-31 15:52:44 Don't ask
general 2023-01-31 15:53:21 Well then I build roscale all the time
general 2023-01-31 15:55:38 No no no, you put the second number before! It's 109, obviously...
general 2023-01-31 15:58:03 But then the commutative property of addition means that 910 = 109, so I'm still right
general 2023-01-31 15:59:28 Yeah, it's the battery
general 2023-01-31 15:59:41 duh
general 2023-01-31 16:00:52 Oh, I thought you meant cell phone
general 2023-01-31 16:01:56 No, they're more plastic, because even the motherboard is made with lots of it
general 2023-01-31 16:02:25 Yes
general 2023-01-31 16:02:51 That's why I melt plastic and breath the fumes
general 2023-01-31 16:04:11 **NOTE TO YOUNG PEOPLE! DON"T ACTUALLY BREATH IT!!**
general 2023-01-31 16:05:05 Personally, data sounds better
general 2023-01-31 16:05:33 Cuz data is boring, and data is stupid
general 2023-01-31 16:05:58 It's just what the data shows
general 2023-01-31 16:06:12 Yeah, bro
general 2023-01-31 16:06:30 So that's why I prefer data
general 2023-01-31 16:07:20 I respect that, and thanks bro
general 2023-01-31 16:08:16 Yes, yes we did

general 2023-04-09 07:55:46 Just make something with effort
general 2023-04-09 07:56:48 I literally saw a frickin' cheese burger made of 5 blocks get more points than a cool jet

general 2023-04-09 08:06:58 Well, master has you getting it in the <#627195143040139264>

general 2023-04-09 08:09:37 Damn
general 2023-04-09 08:10:47 Well, goodnight everyone, and happy Easter for those who celebrate it!
general 2023-04-09 08:11:26 Wow, lol
general 2023-04-13 10:34:28 You know, it kinda hurts to see my past five and a half hours thrown in the garbage by everyone who sees it in <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-04-13 10:35:28 But when someone spends all of 2 minutes assembling a cheeseburger made of 5 blocks, everyone loves it
general 2023-04-13 10:37:07 It's an old diesel model
general 2023-04-13 10:37:22 That's how they looked
general 2023-04-13 18:39:48 Yo, where that part two at?
general 2023-04-13 18:45:54 Bruh, I wasn't
general 2023-04-13 18:46:29 I'm NOT SpAmMiNg!
general 2023-04-13 18:47:11 I swear, dyno these days
creations-chat 2023-04-14 19:12:48 How can I improve this so that people actually find it interesting? Keep in mind, it's from the early days of diesels
creations-chat 2023-04-14 19:14:58 
creations-chat 2023-04-14 19:23:55 Like what? let's talk in general so we don't have slowmode to worry about
general 2023-04-14 19:25:48 <@712572061901652080>  What do you mean ugly? and what parts are missing?
general 2023-04-14 19:38:51 I need opinions: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/1096513952982253608/RobloxScreenShot20230414_042621372.png
general 2023-04-14 19:39:07 What can I do to make it better?
creations-chat 2023-04-14 19:42:27 First of all, can't change the size if I want it functional, and second it's from the early days of diesels; they were all simple in that era
general 2023-04-14 19:43:33 What do you mean? how do I do that with the letters and numbers?
general 2023-04-14 19:45:16 But then how do I make it flush with the sides?
general 2023-04-14 19:47:04 No like how do I make it look like it's just part of the side? Won't there be holes?
general 2023-04-14 19:48:05 I appreciate the help, but I refuse to use motorlocking
general 2023-04-14 19:50:55 Woah woah woah, are you using the new app?
general 2023-04-14 19:53:06 The new app roblox is pushing?
general 2023-04-14 19:53:32 It sucks
general 2023-04-14 19:53:41 It's laggy
general 2023-04-14 19:54:02 And the website is easier to use
general 2023-04-14 19:54:57 What is this?
general 2023-04-14 19:55:18 Why?
general 2023-04-14 19:55:42 Why?
general 2023-04-14 19:57:28 Also, you're badatgame
general 2023-04-14 19:58:24 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-04-14 19:58:56 That's what yo mamma did
general 2023-04-14 20:00:31 And inadvertently started a new one
general 2023-04-14 20:02:51 Only to promptly change it's course
