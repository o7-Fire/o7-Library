plane-crazy 2018-12-11 20:35:20 Hello
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 20:45:39 Hey, can I ask you guys a question? I'm just joined.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 20:45:58 How do you get a rank?
creations-chat 2018-12-11 21:06:59 a basic ship i made that actually works
creations-chat 2018-12-11 21:07:06 
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:09:45 i made my first trashy creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:10:42 wait, do i have to make it work in all 4 directions or just vertically? if its just vertically that i could do, I have an idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:11:53 Hm.. I'd say advanced, as a noob. Having at least a little experiance before suggesting stuff may help it filter down the stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:12:10 after all, i have 2 suggestions that ill wait a bit for.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:14:39 uh if i submit more stuff should it be able to move in any direction or is vertical ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:20:15 So I decided to run a test to how fast I could go.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:20:23 Want to see the player look?
creations-chat 2018-12-11 21:28:33 alright
creations-chat 2018-12-11 21:30:27 i think ill add an "escape" thing, simply because i think its insanely fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:52:10 hey i made some cool ship thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:11:32 Wait a second. Can I check if 2 things haven't been suggested yet?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:12:00 Ladders and Doors. are those highly requested
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:12:37 oh ok
