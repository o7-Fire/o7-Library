general 2020-04-25 19:24:20 oof
general 2020-05-03 02:58:38 You know, the recent updates to the save data has really reduced lag, but if the floating island (which nobody cares about) were removed, nearly all of the lag would be diminished. Please Fix
general 2020-05-03 03:00:38 ye im assuming thats not a casual gaming pc
general 2020-05-03 03:00:44 but nvm that
general 2020-05-03 03:01:02 removing the floating island would really help reduce lag

help 2020-10-20 03:30:54 does anybody know what a vertical stabilizer is?
help 2020-10-20 03:40:08 This is what I'm trying to fix
help 2020-10-20 03:40:42 The issue is that my plane spines on the y axis when I use a conveyor engine
help 2020-10-20 03:42:31 ok ill try that
help 2020-10-20 03:49:01 Yes I think the root of the problem is that the vertical stabilizers are too small in ratio to the rest of the aircraft.
help 2020-10-20 03:49:06 Thanks for the information btw.
