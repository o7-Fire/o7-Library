The Tale of shanky113 (1000494111675142266)
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:16:20 Hey so, I'm trying to build the spy balloon. I've got everything else working
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:16:28 but when I try to make it go forwards,
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:16:33 It just spins like this:
general 2023-02-24 21:17:35 Oh hey Chiseled!
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:17:45 Like it just pitches up and down
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:17:56 For whatever reason it won't let me upload the screenshot
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:20:25 why
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:20:41 How come other people do
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:20:48 I just want help with my build
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:21:36 Well I'll try to describe it
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:21:42 It pitches the balloon up and down
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:21:45 How do i fix that
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:22:33 -_-
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:23:00 Yes it pitches up when I move forwards
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:23:07 and it pitches down when I move backwards
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:23:24 and I've tried all sorts of propeller combinations to try to get it to fly straight
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:25:39 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:26:41 No it spins on its pitch axis if i hold it down for too long
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:27:15 I think it has something to do with the propellers not being on the balloon's center of mass but I can't find its center of mass
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:27:33 because I have ballast blocks which allow it to hover like a balloon
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:27:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:28:19 But I can't seem to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:28:45 no they're too high and too low
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:28:52 I put some on the bottom to try to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:29:14 If i put it in the main part of the balloon then it moves downwards when I press w
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:29:29 That's what I thought
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:29:49 But I can't find the center of mass in order to ballance it out because I have ballast blocks that change the center of mass
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:29:58 The ballast blocks allow it to float like a real balloon
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:30:14 The ballast blocks change the center of mass once I spawn in
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:30:55 The center of mass must be shifting up higher into the actual balloon part
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:31:02 but I just need to figure out where
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:32:53 0.0
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:32:59 OMG YOU'RE JOKING
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:33:03 I GOT IT ON THE FIRST TRY

plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:34:52 Kinda random but yeah I agree
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:35:26 Uhh, build a F23
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:35:41 Build the YF-23
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:35:44 Look it up
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:36:38 No it doesn't
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:36:55 Its a very unique looking plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:36:59 Its unique
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:37:04 Which is why you should build it
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:37:36 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:37:44 And some versions have canards on the front
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:38:28 Yeah, except, people say that the Su57 is based off of the F22 but its actually based off the YF23
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 21:38:38 This man is correct
