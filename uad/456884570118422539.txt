The Tale of the_fritzinator (456884570118422539)
creations-chat 2019-08-11 03:19:20 I have to ask, for the creations ranks, can you get more than one rank per creation (if it satisfies multiple ranking categories) or is it limited 1 per creation?
help 2019-08-11 13:55:23 Speaking of ranks, can one creation achieve multiple ranks (qualifies for multiple ranking categories) or is it limited 1 rank per creation?

creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:48:54 I checked and cross referenced everything from movie images and even someone's LEGO recreation of it.

help 2019-08-18 03:15:46 Just asking here, how long does it take to receive a rank after requesting? Not to be rude or anything, just wondering what's the wait time.
help 2019-08-18 17:38:42 How do I receive a requested rank? I have everything needed for VTOL Master [V], now do I just wait or ask a mod?
help 2019-08-18 17:42:42 Thank you! Will do.

bug-reports 2019-10-15 00:00:48 Does this count as "potentially game breaking"? You can translate any creation sideways to an infinite degree (as far as I can tell)

bug-reports 2019-10-15 00:31:31 Yeah look at my message above
bug-reports 2019-10-15 00:31:43 We all moved our creations into 1 plot lol
bug-reports 2019-10-15 00:31:59 Super game breaking
bug-reports 2019-10-15 00:59:25 The whole translate-your-creation-to-another-person's-plot bug allows you to trap them in a box and do whatever you want (until they spawn a creation or die). Pretty funny.
