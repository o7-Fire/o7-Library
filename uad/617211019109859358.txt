plane-crazy 2021-07-13 21:59:46 The real counterpart is the allouette, aka one of the first attack choppers to be manufactured.
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 22:08:28 As a meme version you could paint it like cheese
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:10:14 Nice gustav so far
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:10:38 Yeah, it‚Äôs not really that common of a build, I‚Äôve never actually seen one in game yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:56:06 I own a plane that‚Äôs three and a half, sadly I ran out of space so I can‚Äôt finish the very back part.
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:56:46 Oh man that‚Äôs realistic, great work on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:01:23 I mean, it is a 800mm versus a 105mm gun.. but otherwise yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:01:37 I‚Äôll be sure to check it out
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:02:11 Ah yes, the doors are also realistic
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:02:18 I give this build a 10/10
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:03:27 I would post by plane and quadrotor evac chopper but I don‚Äôt have picture perms lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:05:36 Uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 00:05:45 How exactly? Do I just keep ranking up or what?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 14:12:44 You could try a STuG III or a SU-85, maybe even perhaps a M56 ‚Äúscorpion‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 14:37:27 Nope, lol

creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:17:03 or basic front landing gear, middle to rear is easy enough, I just can‚Äôt get the turning part to fit in a small space
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:19:19 Oh cool, thanks!
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:21:38 Are airbrakes required or do they have braking of their own? I like to utilize flaps and airbrakes
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:23:52 Also very nice C-5
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:25:59 And is there possibly any suspension travel or dampening visible? Just for pure aesthetics lol
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:29:11 I can see you don‚Äôt mess around with this, do you have anything like the front gear from passenger airlines?

creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:22:18 Yeah, attempt pistons, they can also freak out but less of a chance
creations-chat 2023-02-05 23:55:35 No lol, it says weather balloon not spy balloon
creations-chat 2023-02-06 14:34:36 Make is shorter, front LESS peeked in front of the tracks, give it better angles
creations-chat 2023-02-06 14:36:43 Soviet turret designs have always been tight, so just try to make it look scaled, and don‚Äôt use conveyers, they look either weird or clunky
creations-chat 2023-02-06 14:39:25 Also if you‚Äôre going for interior don‚Äôt try, there‚Äôs no point because every Russian tank is built to be small and tight, so very difficult to build interiors

creations-chat 2023-02-09 00:13:41 I thought the T-14 was mass produced with a autocannon 650mm cannon?
creations-chat 2023-02-09 00:16:02 Ohhh okay I see, but what if we covered the hull in ICRMs and or gen 5 ERA?
creations-chat 2023-02-09 00:18:06 Oh I meant on the U-boat, add Patriot missile systems too just to be safe, 40 of them to be exact
creations-chat 2023-02-09 00:21:06 Just add some diesel fuel tanks
