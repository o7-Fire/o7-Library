general 2021-01-06 09:21:38 Im loosing my mind trying to build a helicopter
general 2021-01-06 09:21:59 Nah nah Im on to tomething
general 2021-01-06 09:22:01 something
general 2021-01-06 09:22:13 I've got a decently stable hover atm
general 2021-01-06 09:24:45 Real quick to clarify: is lift and center of mass universal across the craft or only applies to connected parts?
general 2021-01-06 09:24:54 It would really simplify things
general 2021-01-06 09:25:00 Thank frick
general 2021-01-06 09:25:11 Yeah balast would be stupid useful for heles
general 2021-01-06 09:25:28 Back to suffering
general 2021-01-06 09:47:53 I hate helicopters >:|
general 2021-01-06 09:48:36 ```g a m i n g```
general 2021-01-06 09:55:09 Ahhhh Im getting close to having a helicopter
general 2021-01-06 09:55:44 I put a spiny boi on the back
general 2021-01-06 09:55:48 to counter act it
general 2021-01-06 10:29:59 EYYYYYY
general 2021-01-06 10:30:05 I GOT THE HELI WORKING
general 2021-01-06 10:30:51 God that was such a nightmare to make
general 2021-01-06 10:36:07 Is there a way I can stream the heli to y'all?
general 2021-01-06 10:36:16 I wanna show it off but I dont have nitro
general 2021-01-06 10:52:26 Helicopters
general 2021-01-06 10:52:32 I understand them now
general 2021-01-06 11:17:10 OHHH SHIT
general 2021-01-06 11:17:15 Its 6 am
general 2021-01-06 11:17:21 Fucking helicopter
creations-chat 2021-01-07 00:52:54 Wait so is the only thing people actually care about how a build looks?
creations-chat 2021-01-07 00:55:00 Yeah, getting stable flight was a head ache tho. I kept having to mess with the center of mass to get it stable. Even like half a block in the wrong spot sent it spiraling
general 2021-01-07 04:02:03 Eyyyy got the role
general 2021-01-07 04:02:06 Lets go
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:04:07 I don't get it 😔  What's the issue with the heli and how do I make it better? I don't want to just build WW2 planes like every other damn person.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:50:49 Do you have any examples of good heli designs? I'm trying to improve :p
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:53:45 Yeah the double rotor thing is an easy fix but I wouldn't exactly say it's super easy to copy helis from real life when the limitations of the game make helis already a nightmare to stabilize

The issue with the center of mass made several designs I based of real helis fall in to the void in about half a second
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:56:57 Yes but it isn't stable when you base it off real life helicopters. The design is easy but getting it to fly is stupid difficult
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:59:50 I've tried ballast blocks in the past which had no effect (Something like a year ago) and helium is cheating. The whole challenge of helicopters comes from trying to balance it so unless ballast was changed for the better real life designs just aren't as doable
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:01:59 I'll need to revisit the ballast blocks. I wouldn't be surprised if they work now and it's never a 1-1 or 2-1 or whatever but the shape of the craft often leaves the tail end waaaaay heavier then the front
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:04:59 Yee but like Lemme trie and draw this out real quick
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:01:27 It looks like a car 😎 (I do not watch anime but I have *that one friend* who won't shut tf up about jojo)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:04:08 I think it'd be cool if you added some sort of spiky thing that pops out

Intake go ***succcc***
Eat up all that air
creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:33:46 Yeah the issue with battle ships is that you either make them too small or you spend 50 hours on it. My first big project was a big old plane that had folding wings and stuff. Looking back at it it's garbage but it's still kinda cool. For the time there wasnt anything that used motors to fold the build together other than fat ass battleships.

creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:02:01 Motorlock gives me PTSD 😨
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:08:28 That's mean... But true. Coloring is bad (never use any black color under like 50 50 50) always motor lock the pilot seat into the cockpit (in small crafts) and lastly, hover thruster have been and always will be dog shit
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:14:31 default landing gear, not pog. And I would complain about there being no motorlock on the wings but Im not a little bitch
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:18:13 Ok so there's this "mechanic" called motor lock and what it is is unpowered, locked motors stacked in a specific way that cause them and any blocks attached to them to collapse into a smaller region allowing you to further detail crafts in smaller areas.
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:21:18 Ohh people constantly complain about how the default wings look too narrow on planes and so they use motor lock to make them look thicker by placing a layer of blocks over everything.
creations-chat 2021-01-20 18:30:03 Im sorry a what what wip?
Not that part moron the SLS MLP
Still dont know what sls is but I assume MLP is multi launch platform

creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:48:26 Big heli, how improve? Looking for final suggestions before posting to creations
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:54:16 A few, the top half looks very blocky and could use some more detailing (some ladders sprinkled here and there could help), and the monochrome color scheme is wack and could do with a bit of diversity. <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:56:57 It's not the color that's the issue, most are very gray from what I understand; however, they are also multiple shades of gray, not just one. A little bit darker near more mechanical parts and a few blocks a bit lighter on the top as if the sun was reflecting off it could go a long way
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:09:53 Having some detail on the sides of the main body such as some half cylinders and ladders could help make it look more detailed without going into motor lock hell
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:11:54 Maybe, trap doors and trails are also nice for detailing.
I gtg, but I'll take a look at if if you post another pic here
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:09:02 Already much better
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:14:56 not at the moment, I'm not all that good at detailing tbh

creations-chat 2021-01-25 02:08:51 Damn here's me not caring, I try to actually help people with build more than "Looks bad 😡 fix or die!"

Bruh " that interior kinda sucks. change the floor color and a lot of things" is hella vague. Doesn't specify anything and the closest it gets is change the floor color but doesn't give any examples of colors that might work

creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:07:02 People just really fucking hate helis for some reason. I only dislike the fake ones that use helium and shit or engines to steer.
creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:11:43 fake helis make me upsetti spaghetti
creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:13:44 You use a form of thrust other than the main and tail rotor to turn or maneuver. Just put it on a set of servos to give it 2 axis rotation for movement.
creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:15:46 Damn you ever considered posting your amazing boat? I'd love to see it seeing as you're so critical. <:m_:778994206948589638>

help 2021-01-26 14:21:59 Yeah so you gonna explain or not
help 2021-01-26 14:22:51 Yeah, usually you put the blades on servos to do turning on command at a constant rate

help 2021-01-26 14:25:49 The closest I've come to cheating with a heli was a bunch of wing panels hidden in my like 3000 block heli to keep it from seizing up in the air <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
help 2021-01-26 14:26:38 No, Then there wouldn't be any room for the rotors

help 2021-01-26 14:28:39 Holy shit it looks like someone set off a bomb at the front, I think you might be over doing it a bit on the motor lock there
help 2021-01-26 14:28:53 Also it swayed side to side
help 2021-01-26 14:28:58 not foward or back
help 2021-01-26 14:29:10 the blades were vertical to prevent that

help 2021-01-26 14:31:22 See
help 2021-01-26 14:31:55 Lmao your first heli is always your hardest. The balance will never be quite right but it will move at least
help 2021-01-26 14:33:11 Lol my first working one is like 12x uglier because I was trying to start with a main rotor that had 2 axis turning and it was before I learned motorlock
help 2021-01-26 14:34:13 Btw how fast would you say the hover thrusters go compared to rockets, I never considered them but it looks very possible?

help 2021-01-26 14:46:58 Do you know how to motorlock?
help 2021-01-26 14:48:00 Aight make the main rotor's motor unpowered and motorlock a bunch of rockets / hover thrusters on the wing panels to make it spin dummy fast, that should help it get off the ground and stuff
help 2021-01-26 14:48:26 As for speed helis aren't exactly fast but 60 is a fairly decent speed to try and get
help 2021-01-26 14:48:55 Use hover thrusters then
help 2021-01-26 14:49:02 Because apparently that also works
