general 2021-05-10 13:49:58 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:45:45 does anyone know a simple way to make elevators?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:46:08 like one on a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:46:20 ah thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:46:50 just the bare pistons or do you put blocks on the top of them?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:47:17 alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:55:16 do you put the ropes under or over the elevator
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:56:21 ohhh wait so you put a rope and suspension block together so it's more rigid and can't fall over?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 14:57:40 okay
general 2021-05-10 23:05:36 is 3 folds ok for a gerald r ford or should I really try to do 4 folds
general 2021-05-10 23:06:19 oops I meant to put that in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:06:24 is 3 folds ok for a gerald r ford or should I really try to do 4 folds
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:10:50 oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:11:20 I would do 4 but the bridge is really tall
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:11:41 alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:11:44 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:11:53 okay
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:12:24 is there a way to fold the bridge onto the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:18:13 I'll just have to experiment I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:22:19 why wouldn't it be as maneuverable?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:23:27 oh ok
creations-chat 2021-05-11 02:47:09 make it wider
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 03:17:22 looks like a tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 03:20:31 what is it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 03:27:31 Shouldn't this be <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:10:27 Closest thing to shredder bugs irl would be like missles probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:11:14 yeah but real life doesn't have shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:12:15 but how would that destroy a vehicle or something
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:12:59 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:13:29 I hope we don't lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:15:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:15:23 true

help 2021-05-12 02:48:32 why does my elevator get stuck when there's another person's plane on it but it's fine when I go up and down on it
help 2021-05-12 11:58:23 I know that, it's an elevator for a carrier. Whenever I use a plane on it the elevator works fine but when my friend uses a plane on it, it glitches out.
help 2021-05-12 12:00:41 I have the force thing set at 2500 if that's what you meant
help 2021-05-12 12:08:38 would suspension on the other plane help maybe?

plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:56:04 also adding ballast on the bottom making it float will increase the speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:58:18 60kts is pretty fast lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:59:39 how massive is it
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 16:59:44 are you folding it?

plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:21:23 <@437078588701933568> maybe just make some type of cylander shape and start adding balcony things on the side
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:23:12 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 17:23:59 does it shoot tnt

help 2021-05-13 18:12:16 also it works whenever I spawn at "base" but it never works when I spawn at "water"

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:25:32 this game should have a feature where if the number of blocks on your creation in pvp goes below like 25% then the vehicle gets disabled
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:25:53 :(

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:42:40 I'm gonna make a battleship or something and fill it up with tnt so it will have armor and once it's destroyed a lot I can do a magazine explosion
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:43:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:43:51 I can't use single blocks if it's super big though because it won't teleport me to the water
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:44:06 F
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:44:23 so I had to replace all the blocks on my carrier
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:45:11 almost every one of my builds is a ship I have like 25
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:45:38 but most look ugly so most of them I don't use

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 00:38:47 this is what happens to your character if you travel very vast and very far
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 00:38:58 nope

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 00:42:07

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 20:32:24 >:O
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 20:33:40 
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 20:34:06 
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:44:43 When it gets soft coded is it gonna be so everyone sees the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:44:57 like sometimes damage and stuff looks different on different screens
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:47:52 pontoons?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:48:02 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:49:59 bruh momentum
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:53:25 crong
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 21:54:45 undate is a update
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:00:13 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:00:21 they're like better cutters I think
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:02:10 why not if they're already in the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 22:03:11 who says it's crappy, what if someone really wanted the pontoons to finish one of their boats or something?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:26:17 is that why people are downvoting I wonder
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:28:37 I'll post one where you can actually see lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:33:34 that's weird it says 6 downvotes on my screen
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:51:36 feedback?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:53:45 gotcha, I do think the bridge could use a redo
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:56:04 the bridge on the real thing is pretty far back though so how far should I move it up?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 23:12:31 so I think I should do these things: rebuild the bridge to make it more accurate (not moving it though), build some jets, make a crane, and add some more detail to the stern but how would I do weathering?
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:19:39 will pvp damage look the same on all screens after it's soft coded
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:20:45 😦
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:21:02 it's not the same rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:22:21 like sometimes when you shoot someone then on your screen they're missing both their wings but on their screen they're perfectly fine or just a bit of damage
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:33:57 is that an osprey
help 2021-07-13 01:18:13 does anyone have any tips I guess on how to weather an aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:09:44 The shape looks good but I think it extends too much
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:52:39 you can find tutorials on youtube if you just want something cool looking but just don't post a tutorial in <#384025409945337856> or act like it's your own
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:54:40 :( just trying to help sorry
general 2021-07-13 16:08:19 how are we even supposed to help lol
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:16:18 ^plus it feels way better when you made it yourself
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:20:40 unless it's a tutorial for motor locking or folding or something right

creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:55:21 does the suspension work
creations-chat 2021-07-13 17:00:35 oh my bad man didn't see where you posted the video
