bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:07:45 There is a glitch which I call an EMP bug where your screen flickers for a second and whatever your flying (mostly affects planes) loses power and tumbles out of the sky, the wings lose their physics and won't keep you gliding and most of the time make you a sitting duck in PVP
