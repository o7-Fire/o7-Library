Can I have feedback for it? I've added a nose since then but that's the only photo I have at the moment. Also I hate this cooldown.
creations-chat 2020-11-22 20:18:10 I've added the cockpit, can I have feedback/suggestions?
general 2020-11-30 07:09:57 How do you suggest things in suggestions?

general 2020-11-30 07:19:02 How come I can't get shipwright rank when I made a ship with over 2000 blocks? I can show picture when I posted for proof.
general 2020-11-30 07:20:01 
general 2020-11-30 07:20:01 Oh.
general 2020-11-30 07:20:44 Thanks.

general 2020-11-30 07:21:29 I didn't request? I didn't know I needed to?
general 2020-11-30 07:22:12 Oh, I also have a Lusitania going,
general 2020-11-30 07:22:18 Alright,
general 2020-11-30 07:23:30 <@!712273624865701921> I did.

general 2020-11-30 07:23:50 I have just submitted proof.
general 2020-11-30 07:24:41 No thanks.

creations-chat 2021-02-23 06:36:38 <@!711915462304464907> FYI, Titanic's 4th funnel was used as a decoration and a giant vent, AKA there shouldn't be smoke coming out of it. Otherwise, superb!
creations-chat 2021-02-23 06:39:15 No problem mate!
creations-chat 2021-06-12 01:30:28 Woah
creations-chat 2021-10-15 00:31:07 Looks amazing, one suggestion as a Brit myself. There would probably be lots of smoke around from literally everything, especially if it is in London.

creations-chat 2021-10-15 00:34:33 Everyone teases you about being obsessed with tea, porridge, and crumpets. They tell you they like your accent all the time, and they say bri ish all time to pee you off. And I get called “the British one” too.
creations-chat 2021-10-15 00:37:26 My point is well demonstrated.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:41:36 Add something to break the windscreen up a bit, it's just a black void.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:43:48 Most likely, but be careful how you place em or it'll look wacky. Perhaps use motors to angle them and then motor lock them, I'm not entirely sure; I don't build cars that often.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:49:35 Any feedback for my carrier?
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:55:18 time to do some sexy deleting then
