bug-reports 2021-04-07 01:35:02 what happened guys?! Just the other day the game was running perfectly for everyone, they made it a lot faster and it was good. Now it's back to the crappy old version. example: my osprey can reach up to 400 if i really push it, but it only SAYS it's 400 on the speedometer, and it actually goes like 70 in the game, what is up with that?!
bug-reports 2021-04-07 01:36:25 and now i cant outrun the shredders
bug-reports 2021-04-07 01:36:30 and get chopped up

bug-reports 2021-06-13 03:54:26 fuck you. this has infuriated me for weeks. and you're here shitposting on it.
bug-reports 2021-06-13 04:22:54 that's bc you don't even have the block that causes the problem.
bug-reports 2021-06-13 13:34:03 Its plane crazy. I put the same code that doesn't work in plane crazy in another game and it works

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:38:31 bruuuuh
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:47:53 well, this is the server for the popular game known as "plane crazy", so maybe, possibly, you dont have to describe what game you are talking about.

and in terms of the bug, i'm of no help, as i have not experienced it
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:26:11 This is my F-35, any tips on how to improve it?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:29:05 bruh
im sure
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:31:32 bruh
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:33:47 what about it? its the turret
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:35:51 since i added it
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:38:27 i need big gun so i added one.
It's not where it is on the actual plane bc its inaccurate (as in accurate while shooting) and i needed a quick, effective beam of bullets
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:41:08 Generally i think its wonderful
-giant gun bc i need one to be effective with it at all
-not fat if you looked at the actual thing
-2 seater bc why not? i want other people to be able to ride it too
-and where else am i going to put them? thats where they are when it is weaponized

(also, mangler thanks for tips)
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:43:36 funni
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:45:37 dont post the link, post the image
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:47:43 stop being such a bitch
creations-chat 2021-12-19 07:43:44 F-35 **inspired** aircraft with working vtol
any actual tips y'all can give me for making it better?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 07:47:43 thanks
the gun is so big bc i had no space in the inside of the aircraft to hide it away in, so i put it where it is on the a-10.
it's so big bc why not? bigger = better amirite
i dont get the canopy part, i thought i had copied that from the f-35 pretty well
creations-chat 2021-12-19 07:50:03 well whats yours?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 07:53:07 no concept, no sketch. I simply combined the f-35 with the a-10 without noticing.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 07:56:33 is what worth copying tho?
oh
im an idiot
creations-chat 2021-12-21 00:16:22 on a side note
i fixed my f-35's gun
creations-chat 2021-12-21 00:18:25 custom f-35*
creations-chat 2021-12-21 00:20:27 yes
creations-chat 2021-12-21 06:37:37 make them extend the absolute tiniest bit, and if they still get stuck, use text signs to place them further out
