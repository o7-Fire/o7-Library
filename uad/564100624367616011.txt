plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:58 When will the lab chamber be fixed so mobile users can open it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:45:06 The red button is not press able
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:45:11 On mobile
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:45:21 Can someone assist me
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:45:29 By informing me
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:45:35 I am expecting a response
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:46:06 Aye
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:46:18 Thank you for your time.
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:47:13 **Issue: the red button on the top chamber in order to get the part required for the event is unpressable on mobile, I just cannot enter the room with that snow machine**
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:47:41 I am expecting a response in my dms, thank your for your time.
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:50:10 This is unacceptable
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:50:18 The only platform that everyone ignores
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:50:25 Every developer leaves it last
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:50:30 My god...
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:36:29 Did I not make it clear enough
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:36:40 Make the lab chamber accessible on mobile
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:36:55 It is unfair for an entire platform to be unable to obtain an item
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:37:00 Just because they belong to it
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:37:11 Why bother add the rest but not one thing
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:37:16 What‚Äôs the reason behind it
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:37:50 It is giving us two options basically
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:37:56 Quit or pay just for that one thing
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:01 That pc can get for free
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:05 It is annoying.
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:17 Should‚Äôve been better
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:38 The fact that the development ignores the issue
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:42 Despite knowing it
bug-reports 2020-12-18 09:38:47 Upsets me even more
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:35:07 solve the issue
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:35:54 <@302698900521877504>  apologies for the ping but can you help, like there is no other way for us to get that item and nobody fixes it...
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:36:13 Ik
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:36:16 He is a mod
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:36:18 Idiot
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:36:39 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:37:04 You make the game models
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:37:07 Am I right
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:37:38 but you have the modeller role
bug-reports 2020-12-18 10:37:48 True.
general 2020-12-18 10:37:56 So
general 2020-12-18 10:38:26 So he does not make decals
general 2020-12-18 10:38:29 For the game
general 2020-12-18 10:38:44 Idiot, I came in this server yesterday
general 2020-12-18 10:39:36 It says 137 not 127
general 2020-12-18 10:39:48 So my problem is.
general 2020-12-18 10:39:58 How will I get aces to the chamber
general 2020-12-18 10:40:05 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è move on
general 2020-12-18 10:40:08 God...
general 2020-12-18 10:40:13 I came here for the problem
general 2020-12-18 10:40:27 God...
general 2020-12-18 10:40:33 You called me an idiot
general 2020-12-18 10:40:38 For pinging him
general 2020-12-18 10:40:42 Not i
general 2020-12-18 10:40:51 I were unaware
general 2020-12-18 10:41:16 I read it, I just did not know it is a modeller of his makings and not of the game
general 2020-12-18 10:41:29 That he is*
general 2020-12-18 10:41:33 A modeller*
general 2020-12-18 10:41:36 Of his own makings
general 2020-12-18 10:41:42 And not like a developer
general 2020-12-18 10:41:46 Making the decals
general 2020-12-18 10:41:57 I joined yesterday
general 2020-12-18 10:42:00 Literally
general 2020-12-18 10:42:22 I though that the modeller role corresponds to a dev making decals
general 2020-12-18 10:42:45 I realised after
general 2020-12-18 10:42:52 that is what I am trying to explain
general 2020-12-18 10:43:01 Can you move on from that, literally you are annoying
general 2020-12-18 10:43:17 how do I get access to chamber if I am on mobile
general 2020-12-18 10:43:20 My pc is down
general 2020-12-18 10:43:42 And the button is problematic
general 2020-12-18 10:44:02 can we focus on the actual problem not our ourselves.
general 2020-12-18 10:44:15 üòÇ
general 2020-12-18 10:44:18 God...
general 2020-12-18 10:44:35 Is that a thing?
general 2020-12-18 10:44:57 so I can get inside the chamber of the lab?
general 2020-12-18 10:45:03 Do I go on the wall and spam it?
general 2020-12-18 10:45:11 I doubt it works
general 2020-12-18 10:45:16 I tried using machines to get in
general 2020-12-18 10:45:20 And it didn‚Äôt work
general 2020-12-18 10:45:33 Ok
general 2020-12-18 10:45:39 Can you show me how
general 2020-12-18 10:45:44 Like do I go first person
general 2020-12-18 10:45:46 Or 3rd
general 2020-12-18 10:46:30 All I am trying to do is just get the item
general 2020-12-18 10:46:38 When will the button be updated
general 2020-12-18 10:47:55 <@!645128367611445248>  thank you for defending me
general 2020-12-18 10:48:02 Good god, I am dizzy
general 2020-12-18 10:48:08 Yesterday I had like an operation
general 2020-12-18 10:48:16 To have a part of my finger nail removed
general 2020-12-18 10:48:20 It stabbed me
general 2020-12-18 10:48:23 It was hell
general 2020-12-18 10:48:39 it is fine calm down
general 2020-12-18 10:48:50 Lol
general 2020-12-18 10:50:02 that is evil.
general 2020-12-18 10:50:08 Lol
