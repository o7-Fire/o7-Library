creations-chat 2019-07-25 21:13:41 I used the 1989 batmobile as a reference
creations-chat 2019-07-25 21:14:35 It isn't very acurate I know
creations-chat 2019-07-25 21:14:55 But stuff like that is only easy on a large scale, and I did it on a more realistic scale

creations-chat 2019-07-26 01:08:12 Building planes, in a game about making planes, is one of the least fun things to do in my opinion
creations-chat 2019-07-26 01:18:21 Anyone know a way to fix that thing when your loading, and your loose blocks load in first and fall, or don't go where they're meant to?
creations-chat 2019-07-26 01:18:36 The bullets in my railgun are doing that
creations-chat 2019-07-26 01:19:54 Well whenever I launch my railgun, it loads the bullets first, and its the first time its ever done it
creations-chat 2019-07-26 01:20:04 I rejoined hoping that would fix it
