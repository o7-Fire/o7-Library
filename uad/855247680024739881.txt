plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:04:12 Quick question: does anybody know a way to fix your ping rising when you load a build with 3000 blocks plus
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:04:32 Cuz mine rises up to 100000 pings in 1 minute if i spawn my pirate ship
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:05:53 Thats the problem, im trying it in a vip server
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:22 Mhmhm, alot of pistons is on this ship
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:27 For the cannons
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:33 Lemme try removing those
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:53 Normal
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:56 2 stacked on one row
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:07:56 Another question
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:08:03 Does spring affect it?
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:08:10 Because im replacing the pistons with springs
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:08:21 Just that it wont be stacked
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:10:29 I removed the pistobs
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:10:31 Pistons
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:10:36 It doesnt crash now
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:11:32 Does disconnector count?
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:14:56 Last question: how do u retract springs. Without the “retract automatically” on
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:17:26 I did
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 07:31:20 How do u mean by barely
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 10:51:06 Folding builds is the worst in pvp
general 2023-05-27 10:56:24 Folding builds in pvp is useless
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 11:09:07 What i mean, is that anybody can shoot at the motor/camera conencted to the 2 builds, which makes folding useless
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 11:10:05 That was an option???
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 11:10:27 Oh well
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 11:10:46 What option should i put on the magnet to weld it together
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 11:10:53 Im not an expert in anything
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 10:51:56 Can anybody tell me how welding magnets work?
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 10:52:06 I tried welding a fold together, but doesnt worj
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 10:52:07 Worj
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 11:04:21 Work I meant
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 11:04:37 Does anybody know how to properly use this?
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 12:51:33 Uhm
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 12:51:50 Who are you?????
general 2023-05-28 12:52:27 Ik this is plane crazy related, but i cant figure out how to weld stuff together using magnets
general 2023-05-28 12:53:17 And yes, i tried the weld option
general 2023-05-28 12:53:58 Despised?
general 2023-05-28 12:54:55 **my ghost ship im building with 5900 blocks on it**
general 2023-05-28 12:55:23 So do u know any way to keep my ship together without the cameras/motors connected if they were to be destroyed
general 2023-05-28 12:55:51 Alright lets keep it down a little, that length is kinda overkill
general 2023-05-28 12:56:35 Yea 6 cameras and one motor is extremely vulnerable?
general 2023-05-28 12:56:46 How many times did my builds split in half in pvp?
general 2023-05-28 12:57:12 They still can shoot it
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:26:29 My group of people with motorlocked builds?
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:27:29 Not me, my friends
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:27:39 Im not the kind of guy using motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:29:15 Stop being sarcastic
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:29:56 im the kind of guy who makes a trash ghost ship
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:30:44 …..
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:32:04 im the kind of guy who makes this
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:32:16 
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:33:57 Be serious
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:35:49 With the way you guys are being sarcastic, it is hard for me to tell if u are serious
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:36:25 Oh it has 6000 blocks, takes 8 fps on an rtx 3050 laptop
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:36:37 Took 3 days to design and build
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:36:58 Thats how you know its extreme
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:38:40 I modeled my ship after the flying dutchman
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:49:25 Yea ikr
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:50:04 IK YOUR BEING SERIOUS
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:50:07 CHRIST AHEAD
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:50:47 Hi gibberish something banshee
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:51:19 Oh i slave x demon
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 13:52:50 Such a small plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:30:58 Does my ship look good?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:31:15 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:32:19 First image is the starboard side of the hull
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:32:33 Second one to the right is the stern
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:32:48 The bottom left is the bow, with the 2 triple cannons
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:33:02 And the last one to the right is the port side with the cannons out
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:34:27 Its not black
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:34:30 Its dark grey
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:34:37 Also its meant to be dark since its a ghost ship
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:35:04 Its already above
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:36:12 Ur lucky that its not night in the pictures, or else you would see nothing
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:37:57 I purposely made it dark, and hard to see because it is a **GHOST SHIP**
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:38:45 I want to see you do better
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:39:24 Then don’t criticize them
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:40:51 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:41:31 Ok u win there
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:44:32 But i disagree that my ship looks bad………….if thats your opinion that u think my ship is bad then alright.
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:47:21 Lemme ask you this quick question
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:47:31 How many blocks was that carrier both acc combined?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:47:57 Thats nice
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:48:14 6900
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:49:07 Nah i use beam when needed
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:49:25 I only use single blocks because some parts need different designs
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:49:47 Probably like 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:50:27 Thats like 14 of those to equal the block count of mine
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:50:42 Do u recieve any lag?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:50:46 Using ur carrier?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:51:06 Whats ur average fps with it? Last u remembered?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:51:30 I get 6-16 fps
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:51:50 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:52:14 I never said it makes ur build good
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:52:39 Is it really irrelevant?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:53:06 Yea ik it doesnt matter for you
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:53:30 We each have different matters
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:53:37 Bad?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:53:58 Okay tell me is it a fact or your opinion that my build is bad?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:56:08 I dont think my ship is made of flat edges
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:56:47 Me too
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:57:06 Have u made a ship with sails before?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:57:40 What do u make?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:58:19 Can u present me one of your jets?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:59:08 Tbh that doesnt even look bad
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:01:12 u still have the same opinion with this?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:16 Is this still made out of flat edges and basic wedge?
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:33 Well kinda
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:59 I have 25 days
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:03:49 u cant tell me both the stern and bow is made of flat edges
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:03:55 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 07:58:00 Thats nice
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 07:58:28 That guy built a nice vasa
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:40:37 i want opinions
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:49:40 Thats it???
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:49:46 No other problems?
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:49:55 Its suppose to
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:50:02 Its the flying dutchman that i designed it after
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:50:29 Flying dutchman doesnt fly
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:50:36 It does a submarine move and goes underwater
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:51:00 I tried alot of idea
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:51:02 Its too hard
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:51:35 Flying dutchman is green
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:52:01 
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:53:10 Its actually green
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:53:16 Like a tint of dark green
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:53:32 My old ghostship: people complained its too dark
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:53:45 My new dutchman ghost ship: the colour is too ugly
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:54:10 
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:54:12 Bruh
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:54:23 They are as big as i can make them
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:54:46 No more bigger, if i make it bigger it will just colide to the other fold
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:56:13 Sir
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:56:18 What do u not like about the colour
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:56:22 Is it too ugly
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:56:27 Does it make it look old?
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:56:32 Is it too dark?
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:57:14 ITS A GHOST SHIP
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:57:20 its meant to be very dark
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 07:58:26 Its the movie version
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 06:34:18 I do not understand the Community of this game
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 09:49:18 Hey questions for people still alive here
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 09:49:52 Can anybody suggest a way for me to prevent my 1700 wooden warship from capsizing because of the top heavy mast?
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 09:50:52 Other then adding heliums
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 10:15:14 And where do u think i should place it
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 10:33:00 Yea but if i add ballast down, it will flood the lower gun decks
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 10:33:46 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 10:36:09 What about propellors
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 10:36:53 What kind of engine should i use for it to be as fast as 50 sps, yet prevents it from pitching
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 01:50:24 Goodluck fittinh that
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 01:52:34 If u wanted to do it, dont tell us

creations-chat 2023-06-27 12:25:02 my last ships was complained to be too dark, so i gave it a simple bright grey color, the interior was basic but not as basic as the other ships i made
creations-chat 2023-06-27 12:28:31 Yea ik, i shouldve added more interior
creations-chat 2023-06-27 12:32:54 My unrealistic ship had a better rating then the ship i made today, the picture is the unrealistic ship
creations-chat 2023-06-27 12:35:38 That is factually wrong, it doesnt rule
creations-chat 2023-06-27 12:38:31 I changed it because it is outdated, and im also not a vegetable

general 2023-07-08 02:39:40 Jeff bezos?
general 2023-07-08 02:40:09 JEFFERY
general 2023-07-08 02:40:17 JEFFERY CHEESE
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 02:44:07 this ship which operates in **AMERICA SIMULATOR** is here lol


if the guns dont scare you, the lag would
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:45:30 I have a question
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:47:21 Why and how did my first sailing ship which operates a 8 fps for me, and uses bad design for its shape get a better rating than my newest ship which is bigger, more efficient and yet uses better designs
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:48:33 
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:48:39 The first image is my new ship, the second is my old
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:50:32 Oh bruh this guy is typing
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:50:44 Nvm he isn't
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:51:30 Nothing
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:51:40 Totally wasn't talking about you
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:52:01 I don't remember if ur the one who said it looks like a broccoli stem
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:52:23 Is the camera angle part of the build?
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:52:55 Plus the colors were made brighter BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID  the LAST SHIPS WERE VERY DARK
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:53:36 So it limits you from checking the bow and stern?
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 04:53:43 And giving it a higher rating?
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 21:55:01 Is the piston issue fixed?
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 08:15:05 Do u guys have a square rigged sail designs?
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 08:15:17 Im out of ideas
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 08:18:40 Anybody?
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 02:31:14 Viscount?
