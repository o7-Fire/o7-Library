plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:34:20 the hell is the deal with the new anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:34:31 someone is gonna burn
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:34:48 If I turn them off I enter the abyss
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:35:56 Game like freezes and I go flying at like 68578921+ whatever numbers more speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:36:15 and it only happens with motor 2's and my fat turret
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:37:46 It's worse now though with that anchor block update
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:39:15 Yeah when  turn them on the turret rotates uncontrollably
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:39:36 it's a big tank turret
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:39:45 it even wiggles like it's on a spring
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:39:56 even though it's base is a solid motor
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:40:07 it's really scuffed
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:42:22 No not really
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:44:30 üî•
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:53:32 Yeah this is what happens when I turn off the anchor block that I need when I spawn my tank, obviously it's working as intended.
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:54:03 indeed
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:54:12 I'm sure the mechanics can make it work
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:58:53 Eh sometimes it works I guess, I think tensioning the tracks just makes it go ballistic because "**PHYSICS**".
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 04:59:18 Roblox gives me cancer though I swear

creations-chat 2019-12-14 17:49:32 This is a remodel of my super heavy design for PvP, I removed the tracks for wheels to reduce lagg and drop block count. I also slammed it to make it look like a hover tank but really it's just a low rider, planning to install hydraulics soon kek.

general 2020-01-30 05:54:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-30 23:35:38 This turret is üåä üí¶
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:11:16 You could also do solid blocks behind glass and see how that looks.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:12:14 zoomer detected
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:13:01 It looks good
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:13:11 really good
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:13:43 that challenger looks bad
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:14:13 ~~I miss the old low profile challengers~~
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:14:55 üòÇ
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:19:16 I kept building on that ship but turned it into a flying cruiser.
Gotta do the rear hover engines now.
How does the bridge look? I'm not really sure how much detail I can fit into a small space like that.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:21:51 Yeah I made the walls on it invert so it wasn't just a block and gave it a smoke stack. Not sure if I should add like some radio antennas to it.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:22:16 might get too cluttered
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:25:10 Yeah I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:25:22 LOL that dude is hangin
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:25:28 like in that one movie
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:25:30 xD
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:28:29 Smoke stack
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:28:38 brUh my roblox just crashed
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:28:42 pls god
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:28:45 have mercy
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:30:17 Gotta have that so I can fit the smoke
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:37:01 The back looks üëå ?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:39:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:39:40 I might take you up on that suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:40:11 Like the one on my tank you think?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:40:26 aight sick
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:40:39 I like that idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:41:11 we need smaller cylinders ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:53:17 Because it's got no ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:53:55 wot
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:54:04 they must be set to 0
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:54:31 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:54:44 do that and it'll sink
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:57:44 wheels.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 00:57:57 shoulda made tracks then boi
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:07:13 this troll noob
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:12:28 Got the extra MG's on it.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:12:51 sorta bulky so I didn't put two on the back
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:14:42 I don't really like to use cylinders too much
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:16:39 What if I did it like this?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:18:03 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:20:27 It actually is a lighter grey
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:20:39 that's all 100's the bit under is all 80's
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:21:25 110?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:21:32 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:21:53 that stands out a bit better I think.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:24:31 kk
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:24:37 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:24:46 all the guns aiming looks sick
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:25:19 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:25:27 Yeah that does look nice
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:26:16 Like half done hover cruiser
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:26:49 Half wedges or nah?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:28:47 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:31:27 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:35:12 hey...  radar on the AA or nah?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:37:59 motors are so bipolar I swear
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:38:18 sometimes they'll work while surrounded and other times it's a nope.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:39:42 nvm I figured it out it was upside down.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:39:49 üòÇ
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:40:15 it spins to it's hearts content
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:40:43 needs to be faster tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:41:48 nonono 2.5
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:42:15 no pls
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:42:45 it's got just enough room too
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:43:02 we need SAM's
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:43:04 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:43:14 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:43:43 I need to be able to
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:44:16 Why sould I want a CIWS
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:44:28 that'd melt so hard
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:45:07 or 6 but they have a max range and only turn at like 5g's
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:45:49 it's basically a SAM
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:46:07 the CIWS is the detection system and all that
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:46:36 I don't want the turret
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:46:40 I just want missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:46:47 I do
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:04 missiles do the SHHHHHHWOOOOOOOOOSH
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:09 BLAM
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:28 Debateable
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:43 why
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:48:20 Seems kinda pointless
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:48:51 that's basically what the SEA RAM already is
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:49:00 ^^^^^^
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:49:02 this
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:49:26 I could work with 4
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:49:42 6 is what I need tho for this turret
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:50:03 would look weird with just 4
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:50:52 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:51:21 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:51:26 flexed on
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:51:55 dude just zooms right on by me with is ebic ship
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:52:34 very casual
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:52:36 looks so nice
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:53:53 It do appear to be that way yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:54:07 I dunno seems kinda radical to me

plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:38:33 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:38:43 Bigger than the map
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:39:20 like 4 halves
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:45:11 It can cruise the sea now to fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:47:09 inb4 it's something I can enter my ship in
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:52:59 was it a bad idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:58:03 I'm so close
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:58:39 More weight in the front and more helium in the back
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:58:50 yeah exactly <@!300103214873968650>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:59:34 I just need to mess with my ballast beams
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:00:31 so close
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:00:50 gettin there
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:03:57 I need a bit of anti roll
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:04:29 the side thrusters help but they are for steering
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:07:35 My goal is to have this thing be able to idle in the air
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:07:55 at the very least idle in a single direction at level
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:08:52 No shit

plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:13:26 OOOOOOOOOOH
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:14:20 kinda lost in the momentum
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:14:22 I can fix that though
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:14:38 I'm so happy
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:16:18 I don't even have to be in the seat
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:16:23 almost at the idle part now
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:16:35 yasssss
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:16:41 I'm hype
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:17:00 I don't have any downward guns
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:17:10 I just made it to smash jets
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:17:50 unless <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:18:06 I'm really really really happy tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:18:15 I wasn't sure this would fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:18:28 It started off as the front of a destroyer lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:19:00 I'm gonna name it the flying pig lol

plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:19:52 epic
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:21:09 Yeah I wanted to make an island before but it's a hastle
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:22:50 there and there you think?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:23:00 I don't wanna mess up the center of gravity too much.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:23:22 I'm gonna set them in after I delete the stuff in their way
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:25:02 I was gonna go further in but there's helium in the way.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:26:42 I got rammed don't mind the rocket pod
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:27:13 I don;t wanna add too much weight battleship.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:27:24 Balancing the back end is really hard
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:28:14 inside
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:28:24 I built the hull then did the helium
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:28:38 some of the outer parts have helium like the smoke stack to balance it
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:29:01 Yeah I still can't stop the momentum with two of them...
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:29:02 Any ideas?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:29:59 I don;t have any prop engines on it
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:30:53 The blocks around the rockets are helium.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:34:54 Yeah steering is really almost impossible with the momentum I get
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:35:01 Maybe I need control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:40:20 It's pretty solid balance wise now
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:44:13 got it almost flat idle now
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:49:16 like this?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:49:50 sick
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:51:07 That made it much more stable
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:51:18 by like a lot
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:52:45 With my thrusters being the way they are I just have to angle them more if the nose goes up
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:52:59 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:53:09 I decided to use an anchor block to stop the momentum
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:53:20 there's not any way I can see to stop it fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:53:30 it'd need so many super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:54:00 that's the front yeah?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:54:05 of that one jet
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:54:36 looks kinda short
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:55:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:56:07 ;-; I remember when I deleted my F-14
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:56:17 I stopped playing for like a month
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:57:23 I'm so happy with this though
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:58:24 you know what'd be cool... a bunch of smoke pipes under it to make it look like a cloud.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 04:58:28 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 05:04:36 I wish more people would make flying ships
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 05:04:56 on accident?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 05:05:00 lol

plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:27:58 I think I watched you getting that thing to fly the other day lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:28:28 The crashes were spectacular
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:28:51 Because they looked like how a real one spins out.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:30:02 Anyone know what buttons I am pressing to make that pop up on the top left?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:30:16 I can't figure out what binds are doing it
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:30:40 none of my binds are near f8
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:31:07 I have an f6 and f5 bind
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:31:16 Yeah I guess I'll have to
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:31:20 it's really annoying
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:31:43 I was in a server with a bunch of beginners anyways.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:32:43 If we meet again you will have to try and land on my heli carrier version lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 16:33:05 ~~I just cut a turret off so much work phew~~ <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2020-01-31 16:59:47 This is "The Flying Pig" started off as a destroyer build turned into a Flying Gun Boat/PT Boat. I guess it's role would be to patrol the area around a heli carrier, it can be modified to carry one helicopter for assaulting enemy ships I suppose. Took me two days to build and probable 18 hours. This is my first ship build and my first flying build I have ever made. <:GWvickyNueWink:395628473030279168> Thanks for reading and thanks for your like if you give one.

plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:12:17 I thought he just got that back
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:13:51 Has anyone dabbled in the dark arts of hidden turrets?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:13:57 I need a professional
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:14:40 I want to make a turret that can pop up out of my ships hull with pistons and then the hull would seal back up under it.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:15:28 like right here
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:15:47 it's hinge open like a double door.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:16:25 Yeah that could work
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:16:42 I like aesthetics.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:17:17 I wanna stuff this turret in that hole
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:17:20 <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:18:09 I just started talking about turrets and holes wym
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:19:29 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:20:40 most of my helium is in this hole <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:22:08 OOOH what if I just make it a really chonk rocket pod and it pops up out of the hull like you said and the deck is the top of the turret
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:22:33 chonket pod
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:24:28 4x5 like this?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:24:40 or rotate?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:25:04 It'd be off center if I did it the other way.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:26:01 Well yeah
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:26:16 I dunno about pistons for the door tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:26:34 motor door is the only door
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:34:30 ?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:40:16 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:45:04 bruh the hitbox won't let it close
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:48:33 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:48:42 looks gross with half wedge blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 17:48:51 not a fan.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:04:31 I have reached peak tightness on the lock
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:05:26 I think they look hot too
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:05:54 that's all that really matters, the aesthetics.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:07:55 I think it looks better with the cylinders like this actually,
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:08:06 really industrial and heavy lookin
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:08:32 ty ty
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:09:18 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:09:36 like to where my cursor is?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:09:41 I could see that.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:10:29 nooo
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:10:57 it's already this wide
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:11:05 I would have to invert
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:11:15 nooooooooo
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:11:23 I am gonna one day tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:11:40 not any time soon this took so long already
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:12:27 It is really low profile though so I could maybe 3 stack
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:13:14 that'd mean only one section would have to be inverted at least
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:13:49 Yeah I would make it wider
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:15:00 Maybe I can tuck a small plane in the hole
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:15:20 fold it's wings like a naval fighter
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:20:15 dew it
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:33:03 He was gonna make it a flyer
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:35:29 I just like how I can reliably pilot/captain my ship from the bridge. It's got a nice view.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:35:41 I'm super happy with this build tbh.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:43:21 Just the inside of the bridge in my seat\
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 18:43:49 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 19:13:35 I added lights for more aesthetics.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 19:14:16 it really pops
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 19:14:45 Skidadle skidoodle your brain is made of noodles
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 19:15:28 these reflections are actually really impressive.
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:12:56 Most people make blocks with wheels
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:13:01 üòÇ
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:14:39 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:14:48 that's a nice heli tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:15:09 I totally saw your F-18 before
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:15:18 with those cancer turrets on the wings
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 20:31:18 Yeah no.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:06:03 Hey vixo
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:06:23 do you know anything about making a flying ship with no helium?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:06:39 My friend is talking mad shit about my b0at
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:07:44 I have all this space after emptying it out of walls and helium.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:10:58 Give me the sauce vixo
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:11:44 The information.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:11:53 I require it.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:12:15 That's all
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:12:23 Just more power?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:13:09 It's gonna be so loud...
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:15:18 I GOTTA FLEX ON HIM VIXO
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:16:08 I did a team battle in a pub server the other day and we just painted our shit red and blue and had a turf war at airport
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:16:20 there was a lot of friendly fire
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:16:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:17:11 The teams system would be implemented as like a party system almost yeah? You would just click to join red or blue?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:17:27 And what about whitelisting obc >:l
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:18:20 ~~If we could whitelist on vip servers that'd be great~~
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:18:30 but the minigames sound cool.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:18:43 They could lead to some interesting tournaments.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:19:05 Team battles/last man standing.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:19:20 Yeah elimination
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:19:30 tag?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:19:36 like a zombies mode almost?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:19:53 If you've ever played forza horizon
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:27:11 okay I'm gonna try props first
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:27:22 I really don't want to use more rockets ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:27:24 so loud
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:30:50 no way will those work like that right?
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 00:33:25 LOL holy shit they do

plane-crazy 2020-02-01 01:07:47 <:Yikes:663181126424330297> I might be able to do an interior now with all this extra room.
plane-crazy 2020-02-01 01:08:42 Really close to flying with 0 helium.

plane-crazy 2020-02-01 01:31:25 Helium looks better when floating with a heli ship and is better for control.

plane-crazy 2020-02-16 21:53:39 Trying to make a floating island now, balancing it is annoying though. I can't recommend it it's not fun at all once you finish the building part.
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:08:21 my computer froze and yeah it wasn't in auto save
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:08:52 Wasn't serious.
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:09:17 but yeah losing shit like that is really upsetting xD
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:25:33 finally worked out how to make this thing fly though just now
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:28:10 just needed a really big and rotatable version of my vtol engine

plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:47:17 now I'm mad I was gonna make a bullet that uses the explosive block blast force but it doesn't do shit
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:47:31 was gonna make a gun for it and everything
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:49:58 the explosion was going to destroy the casing and launch the actual bullet
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 01:58:41 it works this way but it's kida corny to use a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 02:27:52 decided to build the same thing at the same time lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 02:31:55 anyone know what's causing it to sit unevenly?
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 02:32:30 I can't get it to slide into the barrel with it doing that
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 02:32:48 even though the wedges should let it just slide in.

plane-crazy 2020-02-22 15:26:38 and does it even have the ability to stop lol

When people slide between cars in movies and shit.
