the-dump 2022-10-05 13:13:36 you may be surprised but all mbt's can be killed with low br vehicles
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:13:55 panzer 4 has about 140 pen, this is pretty much alot
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:14:31 you can destroy any tank from sides or from behind
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:15:09 Because tank is designed to tank with the front
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:16:00 more armor = more pressure on the engine
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:16:10 german ww2 tanks is a good example
the-dump 2022-10-05 13:16:21 the maus was a disaster
