The Tale of 0samaa (456511186955927562)
general 2023-01-07 14:25:17 are these mfs aware of the signs broen
general 2023-01-07 14:25:21 broken
general 2023-01-07 14:25:36 why did they break?
general 2023-01-07 14:26:19 oh
general 2023-01-07 14:26:20 dang
general 2023-01-07 14:26:21 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 20:48:11 are you the man from the math problems with all the oranges?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:28:41 helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:28:44 or both
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:29:17 make sure apply at center is shut off
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:29:39 that breaks pretty much, **ONLY with folds**
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:25 try lining the sides with in equally if possible
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:32 helium in the middle makes turns really unsteady
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:40 instead of in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:50 place those on the sides equally
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:08 yes exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:15 in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:26 well
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:33 that's probably too much of both
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:39 uhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:40 well
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:45 not all with helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:50 just so it floats a little bit
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:32:01 ok than it isn't propellors
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:32:13 just move helium to the sides instead
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:38 try it
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:40 if it doesnt float
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:44 just add more evenly
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:57 btw
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:34:03 misplaced the one on the bottom right
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:35:18 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:37:27 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:17 uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:30 ok.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:42 is it rapidly spinning?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:45 like really really fast?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:56 did you ever fix the messed up helium 1x4 beam?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:32 ballast blocks will help you control your weight
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:36 not sure about the spinning
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:42 its stability..
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:46 I would say wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:52 But that would cause trouble rising
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:45:04 and dropping aswell
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:45:11 You would have to go forwards and backwards to drop
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:46:44 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:46:47 wish you luck
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:46 well
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:49 oh.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:51 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:56 obviously it will
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:12 should probably use tanks
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:13 uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:14 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:23 I haven't used them in a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:24 I thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:27 when you first spawn them in
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:29 R is to fill
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:32 F is to drop
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:35 I don't
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:36 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:37 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:51:41 if that doesnt work i cant really help anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:55:05 no problem
