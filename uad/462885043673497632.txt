general 2023-01-30 15:51:18 so im still trying to dial the looks in
general 2023-01-30 15:51:21 in most builds
general 2023-01-30 15:52:10 ive seen people make lots of good, round-shaped builds, i like to keep the blocky aesthetic of roblox

that was my least good looking build

my best one was posted in <#384025409945337856> which is still quite meh

ive never really focused on making them look good, if they worked properly i'd be happy with it
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:01:56 then how do i make them look good? i already got the "functioning vehicle" part covered

could you be more specific?
