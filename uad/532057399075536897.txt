general 2020-08-13 20:36:35 I'm trying to get my lonk cable in this week
general 2020-08-13 20:36:39 Link
general 2020-08-13 20:36:52 Got my quest on the 10th
general 2020-08-13 20:37:06 So I'm trying to order one with a 3.1
general 2020-08-13 20:37:14 Oculis quest
general 2020-08-13 20:37:19 Pculus*
general 2020-08-13 20:37:24 Oculus*
general 2020-08-13 20:38:03 
general 2020-08-13 20:38:16 If you don't know of it this os what it looks like
general 2020-08-13 20:38:23 What
general 2020-08-13 20:38:34 :0
general 2020-08-13 20:38:45 Rift or quest
general 2020-08-13 20:39:24 I'm too poor to afford a pc tower for the c port so ima get the 3.1 cable for the link
general 2020-08-13 20:40:04 I don't even have a 3.0 port
general 2020-08-13 20:40:12 So it would degrade to 2.0
general 2020-08-13 20:40:25 U can't even afford the fuckin headset
general 2020-08-13 20:40:44 The tower costs literally 1k
general 2020-08-13 20:40:59 And I don't want to buy it just for some display ports and a 3.0 port
general 2020-08-13 20:41:10 I got the 128gb
general 2020-08-13 20:41:22 Do it
general 2020-08-13 20:41:27 Its more reliable
general 2020-08-13 20:41:41 
general 2020-08-13 20:41:52 Its better
general 2020-08-13 20:42:09 Because the app alone is 5.18 gb
general 2020-08-13 20:42:51 And to enable oculus link go to settings>device>scroll down and enable it AFTER you plug ur link cable in
general 2020-08-13 20:43:43 Oh ahit
general 2020-08-13 20:43:45 Shit
general 2020-08-13 20:43:51 I already got a dead pixel
