The Tale of 1人 (713791902234968175)
general 2021-08-25 21:26:41 I have some down votes of the new cutter, I’ve seen people use them as crab claws, teeth and for the shape of planes, it’ll be a shame for it to be changed
general 2021-08-25 21:27:27 I have a question
general 2021-08-25 21:28:05 When plane crazy 2 comes out will our builds be updated to the new blocks or stayed the same?
general 2021-08-25 21:29:02 Ik but will they be updated if our builds have the old version?
general 2021-08-25 21:29:12 Look
general 2021-08-25 21:29:33 It’s that saw
general 2021-08-25 21:29:49 Oh?
general 2021-08-25 21:30:25 I’ve been doing research on the update and some have said it’s the cutter updated
general 2021-08-25 21:30:47 Oh
general 2021-08-25 21:30:52 Thank god
general 2021-08-25 21:31:27 I wonder if it will destroy blocks or cut them in half
the-dump 2021-08-25 21:32:57 You guys think it’s bad to make a decision when your sad?
the-dump 2021-08-25 21:33:03 Just a question
the-dump 2021-08-25 21:33:07 I need to know
the-dump 2021-08-25 21:34:06 Thanks for the help👍🙃
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:35:24 I was thinking if someone would like to make an bot/mech being controlled by arrow keys but not moving the Roblox avatar?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:35:55 Oh?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:36:18 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:36:42 Nor have I but you have to start somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:37:02 Alr sorry to waste your time
general 2021-08-25 21:44:33 👍
general 2021-08-25 21:45:29 Your profile looks like a guy in a blue hoodie with a white glowing eye to me
general 2021-08-25 21:45:58 ok
general 2021-08-25 21:47:54 Didnt you know that?
general 2021-08-25 23:49:34 I was gonna send a picture of plane blueprint but you can’t
general 2021-08-25 23:50:03 Rick I have a question
general 2021-08-25 23:50:09 Rickje
general 2021-08-25 23:50:47 Tc nvm
general 2021-08-26 21:48:05 If the earth was a ring the moon would be floating in and out the earth hole by the earths gravity force
general 2021-08-26 21:48:19 Yeah
general 2021-08-26 21:48:51 “Wont the moon stop rotating”
general 2021-08-26 21:49:04 No it’s won’t stop inc th e middle
general 2021-08-26 21:50:36 Earth's hypothetical rings would differ in one key way from Saturn's, they wouldn't have ice. Earth lies much closer to the sun than Saturn does, so radiation from our star would cause any ice in Earth's rings to sublime away
general 2021-08-26 21:50:55 Just letting you know 👍
general 2021-08-26 21:51:43 I’m still in college
general 2021-08-26 21:52:28 ?
general 2021-08-26 21:53:05 At the equator, the rings would appear to divide the sun, casting a dramatic shadow over half the world. Likewise, the rings themselves would cast shadows on Earth
general 2021-08-26 21:53:27 Not asking you too
general 2021-08-26 21:53:52 No I meant if the earth was a ring shape
general 2021-08-26 21:54:15 Like a Cheerio
general 2021-08-26 21:54:48 .-.
general 2021-08-26 21:55:18 No it wouldn’t be the gravity would hold it up?
general 2021-08-26 21:55:21 ://////
general 2021-08-26 21:55:59 Yeah but the moon would go in and out that hole not around the earth
general 2021-08-26 21:56:20 The gravity won’t be in the middle bc that’s not part of the earth
general 2021-08-26 21:57:27 Why aren’t you guys talking? Have I scared you off with knowledge?
general 2021-08-26 21:57:31 😦
general 2021-08-26 21:57:44 🌽
general 2021-08-26 21:58:39 I can’t wait for the new wedges
general 2021-08-26 21:58:45 ?
general 2021-08-26 21:59:05 Alright so
general 2021-08-26 21:59:38 The gravity will be the same shape but around it right, so the moon won’t go around the earth it will go threw it. Like a black hole kinda
general 2021-08-26 22:00:03 👍
general 2021-08-26 22:01:31 It already does spin
general 2021-08-26 22:02:04 indeed
general 2021-08-26 22:02:17 Let’s move on to another conversation shall we
general 2021-08-26 22:02:53 Yeah but
general 2021-08-26 22:03:05 Ever wanted to know what would happen if the earth went in a black hole?
general 2021-08-26 22:03:13 Give me a second to type it
general 2021-08-26 22:03:44 If Earth got close enough, the side nearest to the black hole would begin stretching toward it. Our atmosphere would start to be vacuumed up. ... If Earth managed to fall into the orbit of the black hole, we'd experience tidal heating. The strong uneven gravitational pull on the Earth would continuously deform the planet
general 2021-08-26 22:05:00 10100 years
general 2021-08-26 22:06:14 Did you know
general 2021-08-26 22:06:23 A star lives for 10 billion years
general 2021-08-26 22:06:31 Then it explodeds
general 2021-08-26 22:07:11 The sun will live for 5,000,000,000 five billion
general 2021-08-26 22:08:02 A white dwarf is what stars like the Sun become after they have exhausted their nuclear fuel. Near the end of its nuclear burning stage, this type of star expels most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula. ... This core becomes a very hot white dwarf, with a temperature exceeding 100,000 Kelvin.
general 2021-08-26 22:08:20 I’ve never seen a star.
general 2021-08-26 22:09:04 How did you post a picture from your camera roll? It won’t let me do it on this server
