creations-chat 2020-12-17 23:12:56 <@!569539731088736258> Thank you ðŸ™‚ I'm pretty proud of it ... Quite a few folds involved
creations-chat 2020-12-17 23:32:38 <@!614484564101824514> Thanks .. I have a few 'large' builds but I'm new to this server not gonna come in here and spam them all (plus I'm on my older computer rn and they look so much better on my other box)
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:46:17 Enterprise is 5 folds. I can post it folded if y'all want
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:51:23 5 folds and then a bunch of diff speed motors to rotate the letters into place
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:55:07 <@!308156968550268928> cheers, I put about 3 weeks into it, on and off. Nearly gave up on that fourth fold a few times, it was a 'mare

creations-chat 2021-12-24 17:05:31 Thank you! Yeah been meaning to put a couple heavy tanks on, got distracted trying (and failing a bajillion times) to put locked large lettering under the backs of the wings ðŸ™‚
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 22:27:06 anyone else getting unexpected client behavior kicks?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 22:27:47 ok thought I'd goosed my 10k block build and didn't know which change had caused it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 22:29:31 yeah but rn I can't unfold the thing I've been working on for days, was fine all morning. I _have_ added some pistons and I know they can be painful
bug-reports 2022-07-12 17:38:53 Hmmm. My saves aren't saving. From both private and public servers. All my stuff is intact but i can't make any changes that stay. Saves say 'success' and block count changes, but if i leave and rejoin, block count is the old count and (obviously by that point) the save is gone, it's like my gamedata is readonly... Anyone seen?
bug-reports 2022-07-12 17:49:03 F9 capture, username same as here (snosrapkungfu), data slot I'm alternating between 6 and 7
bug-reports 2022-07-12 18:54:25 ok, saved a clean plot with just one block on it to slot 6. Left and waited 5 and rejoined. That took. Left again, rejoined and loaded the build I'm working on from slot 7. Saved to 6. block counts are equal. left, waited, rejoined a 3rd time and still have the single block build in slot 6. I can make changes to other builds and they persist. So.. there's something hinky about my build in slot 7 that means it can't be saved. It's stuck as-is, with 20ish hours of work but nothing I do to it will persist.
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 01:07:14 love it
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 01:07:28 you should post the lock since it's a mindF*
creations-chat 2022-09-29 16:40:53 would rather take an extra class than show work >8D
creations-chat 2022-09-29 16:43:07 in high school (uk, long time back) my math teacher accused me of copying answers out the back of the book, I asked 'how much are these books?'. She said '10 pounds', so I threw a Tenner on her desk and tore the back pages out. I got 2x2hour detentions for that stunt.
general 2022-09-29 19:09:46 his own need to depose him
general 2022-09-29 19:09:53 before Russia just disappears
general 2022-09-29 19:10:30 no - more people are LEAVING russia to avoid fighting than were sent in the first wave of the invasion
general 2022-09-29 19:10:38 Russia doesn't want this war. Putin does

general 2022-09-29 19:13:44 well - they should maybe leave first?
general 2022-09-29 19:13:48 just a thought
general 2022-09-29 19:14:34 it's not politics - wandering into someone else's country and declaring it your own is no more 'politics' than it is a 'special operation' lol
