general 2023-02-07 18:45:53 ive been in this server for about 2 years now and ive only recently been able to verify because this server has some weird ass verification bot instead of using bloxlink like every other roblox server
general 2023-02-07 18:47:14 nah because i forgot my PIN to my roblox account so it litterally wouldnt let me change my bio
general 2023-02-07 18:47:52 bloxlink is like 10x easier

general 2023-02-07 18:48:54 i was born in 2006 do the math yourself
general 2023-02-07 18:50:50 didnt the verification thing tell you to DM a mod if you had trouble verifying?

general 2023-03-16 15:41:50 petition to switch form hyperbot to bloxlink
general 2023-03-16 15:42:32 ATLEAST bloxlink doesnt look like its gonna grab your account when you verify
general 2023-03-16 15:43:24 like first time i tried verifying and hyperbot came up i blocked that shi
