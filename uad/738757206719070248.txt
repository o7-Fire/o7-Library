help 2021-11-15 21:34:45 when I have my airship, it very often happens to other people that they can go through the airship as if it wasn't there, what about that?
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:34:52 when I have my airship, it very often happens to other people that they can go through the airship as if it wasn't there, what about that?
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:36:35 no no no
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:36:42 its not that
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:37:47 they have hitbox that airship elsewhere, but the texture is still in the same place
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:38:34 a few times they said that half of the airship had disappeared
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:39:00 something like that
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:39:08 i try make screenshot of it
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:40:46 they have a hitbox airship elsewhere than me, so the pilot, and they see the texture like me, so they can walk along for them a buggy hitbox airship, so it looks like they're walking on air
bug-reports 2021-11-15 21:42:03 too

bug-reports 2021-11-15 22:00:06 why do people hate my airship 😢
general 2022-03-26 09:51:56 Nah, I have a shredder who shoots, has missiles, self-destruct and can fly over 350
general 2022-03-26 09:53:35 To defend against a shredder, it is good to put ropes on the wings on which there are cutters
general 2022-03-26 09:55:16 So idk, I have a helicopter that has a cutter at the ends of the propeller, such OP
general 2022-03-26 09:56:43 That wouldn't work, I have an FTL glitch ultra TP device there
general 2022-03-26 09:58:01 https://plane-crazy.fandom.com/wiki/Shredder_Bug lol, there's shredder category on wiki
general 2022-03-26 09:59:32 OMG, I need to see
general 2022-03-26 10:00:52 "Joe mama shredders are often very big and super slow and they sometimes cause EXTREME lag to the server. Joe mama shredders are often bigger than 5 building plots/areas. Joe mama shredders are so big that it reminds me of YOUR MOM." XD
general 2022-03-26 10:02:34 My biggest success at Lag Machine is an extremely fast spinning magnet that has blocks on the rope, it can also make a bit of a mess
general 2022-03-26 10:05:44 What does it mean?
general 2022-03-26 10:07:55 No matter what computer they have, a guy once threatened me to report me for lagging his game by my airship
general 2022-03-26 10:10:41 Why are people in <#384025409945337856>  so bad?  I think a lot of the things out there are unnecessarily hated
general 2022-03-26 21:17:35 Omg
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 22:15:18 The heck? The guy built such an amazing creation, and got downvote like that? I would be interested in the constructions of those who put them there
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 22:16:54 Wdym? I have Police Clearance Certificate?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 22:19:14 What do you mean? Why are you so toxic? I'll report you normally

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 22:22:09 What do you mean "smart"?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 22:22:19 That's how I write normally
