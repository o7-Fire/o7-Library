help 2021-08-30 16:02:08 I am making a blue angels plane without any instruction or tutorial. I feel like the cockpit windows could use a lot more work. They look like a half cylinder right now. Any suggestions/constructive feedback? All is appreciated.
help 2021-08-30 16:04:36 If you read what I said, I said it could use more work for the cockpit with suggestions or CONSTRUCTIVE feed back.
help 2021-08-30 16:04:47 It is not completed, so I am working on the wings.
help 2021-08-30 16:05:03 I am not asking you to tell me if something is bad looking, I am asking for feedback on how to make it better.
help 2021-08-30 16:08:47 Looks nice to me.
help 2021-08-30 16:08:56 Maybe 1x2 Triangle wedge in the front.

help 2021-11-06 19:42:42 i am not exactly trying to make it look perfect

help 2021-11-06 19:43:34 Fix how?
help 2021-11-06 19:43:43 I can't extend it any farther, or the tubes won't rotate completely
help 2021-11-06 19:45:17 Okay

help 2021-11-06 19:49:03 to add dimension to it
help 2021-11-06 19:49:06 but i guess it failed

help 2021-11-09 22:40:19 It lifts it up, spins,
help 2021-11-09 22:40:21 and goes to the side
help 2021-11-09 22:40:27 for the spin, I'll just have a motor,
help 2021-11-09 22:40:30 for the tilt,
help 2021-11-09 22:40:34 ill also just use a motor
help 2021-11-09 22:40:42 the rising up
help 2021-11-09 22:40:47 thats where I am a bit clueless,
help 2021-11-09 22:40:53 Maybe pistons, but that would look a bit weird
help 2021-11-09 22:41:01 i could make it really difficult, and a whole process
help 2021-11-09 23:15:06 
help 2021-11-09 23:15:09 When I hit start,
help 2021-11-09 23:15:16 It rotates.
help 2021-11-09 23:15:20 even though it is servo,
help 2021-11-09 23:15:24 it bounces up and down
help 2021-11-09 23:15:47 Like, I don't press anything.
help 2021-11-09 23:15:50 it just does
help 2021-11-09 23:15:53 idk why?
help 2021-11-09 23:16:36 Anyone have any ideas why?
help 2021-11-09 23:31:47 Yeah,
help 2021-11-09 23:31:49 it was a servo
help 2021-11-09 23:31:56 i tried removing the anchor block
help 2021-11-09 23:32:04 and attaching it to the base
help 2021-11-09 23:32:07 instead
help 2021-11-09 23:32:31 I am going to try and do the yaw part above the spinning part
help 2021-11-09 23:32:34 and see how that works
help 2021-11-09 23:33:01 I did,
general 2021-11-10 00:34:29 why is height limit 40 while the width of the plot is 50?
general 2021-11-10 00:35:38 ok
general 2021-11-10 00:35:39 i was 1 off
general 2021-11-10 00:35:57 but like, if it is gonna be 51 wide, I just dont get why the height limit is much smaller.

help 2021-11-13 21:59:07 Okay.
help 2021-11-13 23:50:02 Okay, but the rope would hold it from going to far, and the springs would launch it, but how does the thruster fit into the mix?
help 2021-11-13 23:50:03 what does it do?
help 2021-11-13 23:50:10 well, in this case what would it do
help 2021-11-13 23:50:35 Ok, but the rope would also keep it from going up?
