plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:05:33 i can attack the shredders who actually need them
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:06:23 i joined a pvp server with a dood who had 3 tutorial shredders and was spawn killing, so i brought out my 15 and just went after him since he needed shredders. he told me i was copying him then said "die" when i killed him for the 2nd time.
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:06:53 and here is me killing him with the most simple build in the world
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:08:40 nobody likes boats, they just tutorial shredders and ACTUALLY USE THEM
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:08:44 i just use mine for the lolz
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:09:31 what i mean by "nobody likes boats" is the people who tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:10:01 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:10:16 i hate when people join pvp but blacklist everyone to start building

general 2020-11-25 16:44:42 no.
general 2020-11-25 16:44:48 im asking questions
general 2020-11-25 16:44:55 yus
general 2020-11-25 16:45:05 !
general 2020-11-25 16:45:30 when did i say they're all bad
general 2020-11-25 16:45:34 im talking about where i am currently
general 2020-11-25 16:45:40 if you actually read
general 2020-11-25 16:46:16 and if you didnt change the topic quickly
general 2020-11-25 16:46:28 i would've said "yes ik im talking about the area im in"
general 2020-11-25 16:46:55 
general 2020-11-25 16:46:59 thats what im talking about
general 2020-11-25 16:47:37 doesnt speed just make the turning circle longer?
general 2020-11-25 16:47:47 a
general 2020-11-25 16:48:36 idk why but when i use my P-400 or P-40E and go to turn it takes around 10-15 seconds to complete the circle, thats when im low ground because everyone fights there and barely in the sky
general 2020-11-25 16:48:56 well i was assuming that
general 2020-11-25 16:49:20 it feels slow to me cause all the other planes i engage in combat literally get behind me as soon as i start doing a turning circle
general 2020-11-25 16:49:56 yeah and apparently i dont know that
general 2020-11-25 16:50:04 its not like the game literally thrives off of mouse movement
general 2020-11-25 16:50:13 yeah apparently i dont
general 2020-11-25 16:50:25 apparently vipEmpire is the smartest man here
general 2020-11-25 16:50:28 congrats
general 2020-11-25 16:51:00 oh no you're becoming bts stans whenever someone makes a joke about bts "racist"
general 2020-11-25 16:51:01 lol
general 2020-11-25 16:51:06 im joking
general 2020-11-25 16:51:08 pls dont kill
general 2020-11-25 16:51:24 i was joking when i said that
general 2020-11-25 16:51:26 bruh
general 2020-11-25 16:51:35 wat-
general 2020-11-25 16:51:41 !!!
general 2020-11-25 16:51:44 he do the racism
general 2020-11-25 16:52:16 no!
general 2020-11-25 16:52:18 no click
general 2020-11-25 16:52:24 u eveil
general 2020-11-25 16:52:42 lol.
general 2020-11-25 16:53:32 also the "just dive" when someone's after me, that usually doesn't work when you're a bit close to the ground
general 2020-11-25 16:53:46 the reason i go close to the ground is because everybodys there
general 2020-11-25 16:54:10 cause most of the planes i engage in combat with have faster climb
general 2020-11-25 16:54:35 hmm
general 2020-11-25 16:54:58 i want to show you how i play when i combat but i dont have rec system and streaming to the disc just lags me and makes my fps even worse than it is
general 2020-11-25 16:56:52 but usually this is what i do when i engage with someone: i either turn 45 degrees, go up on a slight slant, do a barrel roll, do anything i can to try and get behind them but ***they somehow manage to always stay behind me***
general 2020-11-25 16:57:14 no.
general 2020-11-25 16:57:19 they actually didnt i think
general 2020-11-25 16:57:28 they used it from a random gome
general 2020-11-25 16:57:55 rip
general 2020-11-25 16:58:44 i also dont know how but half a year ago when i played war thunder i would actually get a 6-7 sometimes 10 kill game
general 2020-11-25 16:58:55 but now i only get like 1s,2s,or 3s
general 2020-11-25 16:59:02 rip
general 2020-11-25 16:59:11 i mean thats roblox for you
general 2020-11-25 16:59:39 mmmmm

general 2020-11-25 17:00:40 i quit for 3 months, got back into the game, quit for another 3 months and now im here.
general 2020-11-25 17:01:00 + another thing is
general 2020-11-25 17:01:35 atleast 60-70% of the time they actually know what to do
general 2020-11-25 17:02:23 thats something else i'd like to discuss, whenever i start turning, they somehow turn and get right behind me again, or they'll be 100 feet away from me turning but yet they can still shoot at me but i cant
general 2020-11-25 17:02:43 uh i remember watching war thunder yters abt that
general 2020-11-25 17:02:59 i think its the... M1A2 abrams
general 2020-11-25 17:03:32 ty
general 2020-11-25 17:03:32 a

general 2020-11-26 17:17:13 WOTB or WT
general 2020-11-26 17:17:23 oh.
general 2020-11-26 17:17:31 long range support tanks do have good useage
general 2020-11-26 17:19:54 lets use this as an example, you're in a light tank going up against a close range heavy tank. your only backup is a long range tank, the close range heavy can shoot the light tank, but not the long range tank half the map away.
general 2020-11-26 17:20:23 heavy tank > light tank
general 2020-11-26 17:20:25 heavy tank wins
general 2020-11-26 17:20:34 .
general 2020-11-26 17:20:37 im using it as an example
general 2020-11-26 17:20:38 jesus christ
general 2020-11-26 17:20:54 i know, im using it as an example
general 2020-11-26 17:21:17 "you two have no IQ"
general 2020-11-26 17:21:26 try learning to read
general 2020-11-26 17:24:09 apparently im low iq for agreeing with someone and trying to support their argument ðŸ˜³
general 2020-11-26 17:24:33 its an example?
general 2020-11-26 17:24:37 did i not say that.
general 2020-11-26 17:24:54 <@456226577798135808> ? clearly stated its an example.
general 2020-11-26 17:26:24 what i was trying to say with that ***example*** is if your tank loses, and your support is a long range tank vs a close range heavy, that long range tank will be able to shoot the heavy. so they aren't useless. but apparently that means im low iq for backing you up exf1nity
general 2020-11-26 17:26:44 yes
general 2020-11-26 17:27:51 uh
general 2020-11-26 17:27:58 have u not seen..

general 2020-11-26 17:28:34 but you're talking modern day
general 2020-11-26 17:28:46 im talking about the early 20th century
general 2020-11-26 17:30:08 cause thats for the example im trying to make
general 2020-11-26 17:30:55 back then sniper tanks weren't useless because half (im assuming half) of the tanks couldn't shoot that far compared to modern day tanks
general 2020-11-26 17:31:12 which is the point i cant make because apparently im a dumbass
general 2020-11-26 17:31:40 darmagon3 did i believe
