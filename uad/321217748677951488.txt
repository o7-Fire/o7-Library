plane-crazy 2018-10-02 14:30:16 (Joke has likely been made 69420360 times already but oh well) Something about this game seems to be just plane crazy.

the-dump 2018-10-02 14:31:55 That is the only counter.
the-dump 2018-10-02 14:33:22 Yesn't = no and men't = not me

bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:38:58 Torque and pistons do not get along well with eachother...
help 2018-10-14 07:42:55 uhh, I just loaded and saved my paddle boat, but it went from 557 blocks to 558?
help 2018-10-14 07:43:03 I didn't add a block?
help 2018-10-14 07:44:28 Doesn't matter since ballasts working completely and utterly broke my boat, going to need to fix it. XD
help 2018-10-14 07:46:10 I fixed it by removing all but 1 ballast beam.

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 22:31:10 What's more powerful, huge rocket engine or super rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 22:31:16 I feel like it's the huge one.
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 22:34:50 Alright.
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 22:35:03 So if I only had one thruster for a racing challenge, which would be better?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 22:40:25 The super rocket engine's a far better choice for a single thruster challenge it seems.
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:38:31 Wait, what even is the speed measured in? (My guess is studs per second.)
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:39:51 That makes things a lot slower considering a stud is said by roblox to be 5 centimeters...
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:40:12 ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:41:20 I just checked with a quick calculation... Turns out if you're going 500 studs per second you're only moving around 90kmh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:36:33 Where do I go to report things like lag bombers?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:38:04 I want to report a lag bomber and have evidence for it, but I don't know where to send that evidence.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:39:09 He under 13 obviously.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:51:27 Can something be done about this guy?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:51:40 Jensfrede's parachute spam car is causing lag.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:52:42 :\
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:52:57 Unless you're giving me robux, that's not going to be happening...
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:17 Most building games make lag bombs enough to ban.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:24 So I can get it for a month?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:52 I've never bought robux and probably never will, but I somehow have 10 (I think from group donations or something.)
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:54:38 hmm
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:18:27 The small blue car in the first image somehow launches the car in the second image decently far with ease.
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:18:32 
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:21:37 The brown build has over 200 max density ballast beams.
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:22:52 (The brown build was just what I decided to make when I was sick of my ground vehicles being pushed around)
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:29:15 I tried asking how that blue car did what it did but the creator of it didn't know.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:53:59 How fast can you guys go on water with just motors? :3
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:54:10 I can get to 333 studs per second.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:28:38 No limit to the amount of motors, but no glitching with 'em.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:28:59 btw I made a slight torque adjustment to reach 338.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:29:16 Also decided to time myself across the water.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:29:23 14.89 seconds to go the whole distance.
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 06:35:18 As long as the motors don't break badly enough to break my car/boat thing that can't drive on land but goes around 340 sps I'll be fine.
the-dump 2019-06-08 16:51:54 
the-dump 2019-07-30 01:52:57 This is an actual serious message, and I want a lot of people to see it. I don't know how many will see it, or if anyone will spread the message, but here goes.
the-dump 2019-07-30 03:20:41 They can't script boi.
general 2019-09-22 09:33:46 How do I suggest something for plane crazy?
general 2019-09-22 09:40:17 There's a bot for it though.
general 2019-09-22 09:40:31 Does the bot automatically turn it into a suggestion or do you use bot central?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 12:48:01 Where could I find the pontoon?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 12:52:34 I've only found the front so far.
creations-chat 2019-09-23 13:01:16 This is what the mechanism used in my off roader looks like   when it's in build mode, pistons are used to push the "gears" together.
creations-chat 2019-09-23 13:01:36 I forgot it'd show as an image in creations lol
the-dump 2019-09-29 05:54:52 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 09:27:19 It's not perfect, but it is a gimbal propeller by the look of it.
general 2020-01-02 05:38:23 Magnet engines should move aside. Idk if I'm the first but earlier today I accidentally made a conveyor engine. From there I kept on testing.
They're more compact than magnet engines and can be used to create stable fast flight. (or really stable fast drag racers) Even boats can use 'em.
general 2020-01-02 05:39:22 I was trying to make a wheel spin using a conveyor, but forgot to make the wheel able to spin.
general 2020-01-02 05:39:26 That's how I first found it
general 2020-01-02 05:39:38 From there I figured out how to use it.
general 2020-01-02 05:40:49 Suspension (bad) or piston (good) + conveyor + pushing the conveyor into a block that's not free to rotate = near infinite torque with an acceleration of 200sps/s in the air and water or 2000sps/s on land.
general 2020-01-02 05:41:02 They're insane.
general 2020-01-02 05:42:49 Look in creations for a larger conveyor engine on a smaller plane. (You could put that engine on almost any plane at least that size and it should let it fly)
creations-chat 2020-01-02 05:43:28 Conveyor Engine Plane (1000sps and near instant acceleration)
general 2020-01-02 05:44:10 Quick word of advice, don't paint the conveyor part of the conveyor blocks or it won't function (weird I know)
general 2020-01-02 05:44:20 fr
general 2020-01-02 05:44:32 They lose their collision if you do it.
general 2020-01-02 05:44:33 idk why.
creations-chat 2020-01-02 05:59:26 Just throwing in context this time. Conveyor Engine plane.
Uses no fuel, can be more compact than magnet engines, 1000 SPS almost instantly with a consistent top speed and a controllable flight. This engine is perfect for pvp move due to the insane agility it provides.
creations-chat 2020-01-03 01:25:31 Turns out that the conveyor engine works reasonably well on boats, and the best part is that the size of the boat has a reasonably small impact on the engine!
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 01:48:56 I just thought of a bad idea... Stacking conveyor engines.
general 2020-01-09 20:28:09 Do you guys think there will ever be a racing map where infinite fuel isn't possible to enable and there are a bunch of tracks to choose from?
general 2020-01-09 20:28:59 It'd be a lot cooler if that was a yes.
general 2020-01-09 20:29:43 Not if you're clever with your vehicle it doesn't.
general 2020-01-09 20:29:56 I can make a vehicle with no fuel needed quite easily. :3
general 2020-01-09 20:30:26 You can use wheels, motors, magnet engines, or conveyor engines to avoid using fuel.
general 2020-01-09 20:31:21 True.
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:32:12 I'm glad somebody's agreeing with me on conveyor engine's superiority.
the-dump 2020-01-09 20:32:50 *Blubs quietly*
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 15:20:38 How can I make a suggestion?
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 15:24:13 Ah
general 2020-03-02 14:31:38 The hover engines are really fun to use, and they're even pretty effective for drag racing. Not as fast as glitch engines, but able to beat a lot of thrust spam builds by reaching 1000+ sps by the end of the track with just 4 of 'em.
general 2020-03-02 14:32:08 True.
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 14:32:29 The hover engines are really fun to use, and they're even pretty effective for drag racing. Not as fast as glitch engines, but able to beat a lot of thrust spam builds by reaching 1000+ sps by the end of the track with just 4 of 'em.
Wonder if anyone's gotten them to go way faster... Probably.
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 14:42:23 I just went from 4 hover engines to 24, and now it reaches roughly 3000sps by the end of the track...
plane-crazy 2020-03-03 17:17:33 F
creations-chat 2020-03-03 17:20:45 Is this a decent speed for my drag racing hovercraft to reach?
(It's powered solely by hover thrusters and the turning was made with a motor 2)
creations-chat 2020-03-05 14:03:43 Please tell me the player that literally built Waluigi has some kind of "building god" role or something along those lines for such a majestic creation.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:23:43 I thought "Hoe mama" was a strong weapon...
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:24:02 THEN I MADE "Hoe mama 2"
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:45:28 I have created a couple of new weapons, a blaze rod and a piece of wheat.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:46:45 I'm about to do exactly that.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:47:05 I'll lightly tap myself with the yeet wheat and have a holiday on mars.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:48:35 You'd need punch for that, not knockback.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:13 In pvp mode, do the different material types take different amounts of shots to be destroyed?
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:32 Thank you for letting me know.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:54 True.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 19:59:44 Does speed change the damage output of cutters?
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 20:00:27 It feels like it's the case, since my faster creation's cutters seem to dish out a lot more punishment than their slower creation's cutters. (Even though they have 3x as many of them)
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 20:00:59 btw a max density ballast beam is way heavier than a max density ballast block 7achyeet.
bug-reports 2020-03-14 18:16:47 Don't know if this can be fixed, but the most recent update seems to have made displacement skyrocket... I'm being hit by cutters that didn't even come within 20 blocks of me repeatedly now, which almost never happened before.
help 2020-03-15 19:10:12 I intend on reporting a player for an innapropriate creation, would it get me in trouble to send the image of their creation in the report if I were to send it as a spoiler?
help 2020-03-15 19:11:48 nvm I can't send the image as an image, only as a link if I can figure out how...

help 2020-03-15 19:20:11 I believe that setting decides if your build starts anchored or unanchored when you test/use it.
help 2020-03-15 19:20:34 Physics being on makes it unanchored, and physics being off makes it anchored.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:57:22 I doubt it'd ever happen, but I'd really enjoy a pvp server that only allowed cutters.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:58:11 Everyone just seems to spam missiles and other explosives in the current pvp servers, so I can never find a fair match for my preferred type of pvp creation.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:58:23 No, he was rickje rolled.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:08:36 ...
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:19 While you're looking in here, I'm hoping on another battlebots event. :3
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:37 Ah, makes sense.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:59 OOooh
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:56:04 *Is interested*
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:56:24 Who, me?
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:01 I wonder...
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:19 Maybe there's another server we have in common or we've seen eachother in game.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:30 or you saw my contest submission or a creation or something.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:59:50 My father intentionally calls it conoravirus to annoy people.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 14:00:07 I wonder if I should do the same.
general 2020-03-17 14:00:40 Hey, did anyone here about the two undecillion dollar lawsuit that's going on rn?
general 2020-03-17 14:50:40 Is purified water's status bothering anyone else or just me?
general 2020-03-17 14:51:27 It's meant to be dihydrogen monoxide though...
general 2020-03-17 14:51:53 I know, but it still bothers me...
general 2020-03-17 14:52:14 At least he's not trying to get it banned from anywhere...

bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:46:55 I don't know how it's happening, but my friend's dropping to 2fps every time he goes on the floating island.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:11 I'm having less lag than before the update, which is what's confusing me.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:20 They went from 60 to 2 and I went from 20 to 40.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:24 (FPS)
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:50:33 I don't get any lag at all from it.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:53:44 Seems like it's also the barn's fault.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 20:02:13 It's personal gravity.
the-dump 2020-04-07 12:13:24 
general 2020-04-07 17:53:00 Isn't that announcement almost a day late?
general 2021-06-25 14:50:24 I wonder how fast the fastest vehicle with treads is in this game.
general 2021-06-25 14:50:39 I managed to get to 375 with one.
general 2021-06-25 14:51:24 Not a vehicle that's solely powered via treads.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 14:55:11 hmm
general 2021-06-25 15:02:42 Apparently this dumb tread setup can reach 385.
general 2021-06-25 15:02:59 Purely powered by motors moving the treads.
general 2021-06-25 15:04:48 I know, the goal was just to reach a high speed.
general 2021-06-25 15:04:52 With only tread power
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 19:58:20 I wonder how many people make silly impractical weapons for pvp mode in this game.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 19:59:51 Sounds like something that can be used to troll outside of pvp mode.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:00:18 I have the ~~stupid~~ brilliant idea of trying to make a car with a chainsaw.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:00:52 It'll work, but a chainsaw won't be practical with all the guns and missiles.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:01:23 PLANESAW!!!!! (trademarked by Fishyfishking)
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:01:55 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:02:07 If it's a net loss you pay 15% tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:33:54 I think the cutters don't deal damage unless they're moving straight into their target... slashing doesn't seem to deal damage, I can jump into my chainsaw car's chainsaw while it's on and take 0 damage.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:37:09 nvm it's pistons doing it.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:48:56 Is there any community more toxic than what feels like the majority of the plane crazy pvp servers?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:49:32 nvm, can't describe what I saw in 5 minutes...
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:42:38 Anyone here agree that shredder bugs are the trashiest build?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:56:18 Good idea.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:58:06 Just go back in time and convince rickje to make them a bannable offense.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:58:28 Make it 2.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:59:05 That'd make so much sense to do ngl.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:59:29 rn the biggest problem with cutters is that they obliterate any build that's blacklisted.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:59:38 I use cutters on melee vehicles.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:59:50 e.g a failed chainsaw car...
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:00:03 I might try to remake a chainsaw car though.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:00:21 Just self destruct on them lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:00:37 xXcringelord69Xx
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:01:12 Anyone got a really dumb vehicle idea?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:01:41 I was thinking more functionally dumb than aesthetically dumb, like golden's idea.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:01:53 I might go with that one.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:02:30 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:03:29 Ornithopter?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:03:45 That might be a tough one, ngl.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:03:54 I might try that eventually when I have a lot of time to waste.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:04:59 I bet helium free ones would be really tough.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:05:22 especially if they're also thrust free.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:05:37 Like, solely flap powered.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 18:38:25 What happens when wings are changed to either fabric or ice?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 18:38:57 I specifically mentioned the two materials that I know change friction/drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 18:56:36 pog
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 19:30:57 The Crimson Ornithopter Dragon, C.O.D for short.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 19:39:33 No, cod like the fish, because Fishyfishking...
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 19:44:13 Dang, the C.O.D can even fly with the gravity set up to 300
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 19:45:12 The slider can be anywhere from 0 to 300 and it'll fly.
general 2021-06-29 20:17:23 Where do I go to report a player in plane crazy?
general 2021-06-29 20:17:40 I have a screenshot of evidence too.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 20:32:48 There's a couple players I'd like to report...
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 20:32:52 Where do I do that?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 20:33:54 I can't report players for blatantly inappropriate builds with evidence?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 20:34:01 Big oof.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 20:35:35 No wonder there's always at least one in every pvp server, and one in some non-pvp servers too.
general 2021-06-30 10:53:27 I tried to make a larger ornithopter than my first one, but I'm running into the issue of the flaps causing forces that are too strong for even max torque motor 2 blocks to function under.
general 2021-06-30 10:56:37 Turns out all I needed to do was tune my counter-weight a little.
general 2021-06-30 11:06:44 9/10 of the plane crazy community members that frequent pvp mode*
general 2021-06-30 11:07:04 From what I've seen like 70% of non-pvp mode players aren't toxic.
general 2021-06-30 11:07:15 29% are a little toxic
general 2021-06-30 11:07:34 and 1% are pvp server levels of toxic
general 2021-06-30 11:08:26 mhm
general 2021-06-30 11:23:20 I wish we could...
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:23:51 Very tough to control, but fast. Any suggestions for making it easier to handle?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:24:19 
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:24:34 Oh, you joined a pvp server that had a lag machine in it.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:24:46 I thought you joined with one in your autosave slot or smth.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:17:25 If the goal is to make the fastest air vehicle possible with only motor based propulsion, would a propeller based design or an ornithopter be the faster choice?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:21:32 So far I've only reached around 400 with ornithopters, but I've only made two of them so far, and they both only had 2 flapping wings.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:22:02 By propellers do you mean motor + propeller blade or the propeller engines?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:22:34 Just making sure.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:22:45 Welp, now I have a benchmark to try and significantly surpass tomorrow.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:23:35 That's what I'd do for propeller planes, though my goal for tomorrow will be to break 600 in an ornithopter lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:23:52 I sent my current one in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:24:58 You can just watch a tutorial for the general mechanism idea, then upscale and/or modify it to suit your needs.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:25:53 My first ornithopter used a tutorial mechanism as is with a custom body, the second one used a larger and less "shaky" mechanism to achieve higher speeds, a larger wingspan, and the ability to fly straight up.
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 21:26:21 Though the the faster a 2 flapping wing ornithopter goes, the shakier it seems to get.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:32:23 Sure, I'll get one.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:34:30 How's a roughly 35 second video of it taking off, flying a bit, and landing?
Wait, am I allowed to send a link to a youtube vid here? I'd hope so.
How do I use streamable? nvm
Here's the vid then. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1eNEKAR_dk&ab_channel=Fishyfishking
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:40:37 I think I'll keep on trying to make faster and faster ornithopters until I can't anymore lol
Running out of files though, so I might need to remove some of my less impressive old builds.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 13:44:18 I think that dragonfly ornithopter might actually be at a functional limit for ornithopters. Making the wings flap any more than they do on that ornithopter does not allow it to function effectively at full motor speed.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:03:13 I can only reach around 400 studs per second tops with a true ornithopter. (no helium, no thrust, just flapping wings.)
I wonder who will rise up to outpace my ornithopter with their own ornithopter design?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:03:47 I want to see a faster ornithopter than mine in the near future.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:06:33 Shouldn't I have at least designer 1 now thanks to my ornithopter?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:06:54 In crations, my score is high enough, and thx
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:07:35 The link of it?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:26:26 Might try that lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 15:38:36 Blub
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 15:44:19 Imagine needing fuel to fly lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 15:44:23 Couldn't be me.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 15:45:05 It was at this moment he knew, he blubbed up.

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:19:40 Ornithopter go flap
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 20:41:37 Yeah
general 2021-07-01 22:49:28 Imagine half block half wedge.
general 2021-07-02 00:06:50 "All blocks must be attatched to the creation" So no treads?
general 2021-07-02 00:13:12 I just though of something dumb.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:14:36 Would my ornithopter technically count for robotics III?
It's 400+ blocks, can turn, can go forwards and has 0 helium...
It also has 4 tiny stick legs.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:15:05 Though tbf it doesn't walk on those legs.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:17:10 Dang
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:17:29 I mean, what would it count for?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:17:33 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:19:26 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:01:02 The UK uses force.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:01:36 I'm from Scotland, can confirm that SciFalded is trolling.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:02:07 The Scottish can pronounce t as long as we stop the English from drinking it.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:02:43 Inspect element go brr.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:03:22 Proves that it's a poorly done job of an inspect element, nicely done.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:00:34 Don't you love it when you have a perfectly symmetrical build and it keeps veering off to one side?
help 2021-07-02 13:04:39 How do I stop my build (symmetrical) from veering off to one side? It always veers off to the left despite being perfectly symmetrical (I quadruple checked)
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:11:46 Not helpful...
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:12:12 Yes, but they're manditory for function.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:12:22 and none of the other builds with the exact same mechanism had the issue.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:13:13 
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:14:14 Oh wait, I see what could be causing it, part of the system collides.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:14:24 Though it happens on both sides...
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:15:44 Fixed that, still veers left.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:16:01 Saying cope is making it harder to do so...
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:16:24 Not funny, didn't laugh.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:25:28 I wonder if it's possible to compensate for it.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:29:33 I FOUND A FIX BY TRIAL AND ERROR WOOHOOO
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:30:03 I don't veer to the left if I set the max wing angle to 10 instead of 25.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:23:22 Crow pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:23:39 (It's a functional ornithopter.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:27:15 120-150 minutes. Somewhere around there.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:27:30 I already had the mechanism to load, so that sped things up.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:27:40 The ornithopter mechanism. (in the middle)
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:28:07 ngl over an hour of that time was stopping it from veering left for no reason.
help 2021-07-02 14:29:14 I managed to get it to function by lowering the angle the wings tilt at during the flap.
help 2021-07-02 14:29:26 It was the crow ornithopter.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:33:54 Welp, time to show a video of the crow. ngl it's not the best at flying in the world but it can still do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZXahHBaTCM&ab_channel=Fishyfishking
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:34:38 I wish I could've imroved the control more, but I feel like for smoother flight 4+ wings are required.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:34:47 Yup, an ornithopter.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:35:12 I might give the crow a wig now lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:37:41 Crow wig pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:40:58 Sure.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:47:18 False
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:47:31 It stops being faster after 2 pairs of wings from what I've seen.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:47:48 2 pairs of wings that are as big as possible might work.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:03:09 I have built an abomination guys.
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:08:46 Anyone want to see my abomination?

creations-chat 2021-07-02 16:42:13 <@!297019145084469248> That's a very stable ornithopter you've got there. Mind sending a closer view of the mechanism used for it?


Who wouldn't upvote an axolotl? A monster?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 18:11:27 I think the centre of mass is a little off, but idk.
help 2021-07-02 19:27:20 Yes, and a tank.
help 2021-07-02 19:27:36 An 8 winged ornithopter tank. It can drive and fly.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:31:28 I'm about to get designer 5. Poggers
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:31:48 I wonder what I should go for after designer...
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:32:16 I'd do terrain specialist but treads are off limits due to technically not being connected to the built.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:33:52 Doesn't it require a really high ~~lag~~block count?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:35:09 I wonder, what kind of nonsensical and whimsical water vehicle could I make to qualify for a higher shipwright than that.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:35:21 Since I prefer an unorthodox approach.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:35:46 I wonder if someday I'll have the max of all of them.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:36:06 Problem with tanks, proper treads are not allowed.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:36:14 Since they're disconnected from the build technically.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:37:08 What if I tried to build lapras?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:37:34 Things can enter HoF with working treads, but the ranks specify that all blocks must be connected to the build.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:37:52 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:39:45 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:40:04 I wonder if I could do something REALLY dumb...
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:40:43 I mean, I've already done something equally dumb to that tbh.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:40:51 I made a tank that's also a functioning ornithopter before
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:41:20 I'm not changing my pfp for blub's sake.
bug-reports 2021-07-03 13:50:39 I'm occasionally locked into a single part and unable to swap parts until I leave and rejoin. idk how or why it happens.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:29:11 Anyone else dislike the block requirements for the ranks?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:37:38 They work, it just means that players who prefer building smaller creations can only get one rank up to the limit, that being designer.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:39:30 Even the lowest block limit (2000) can lag potato players like me... :(
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:39:36 Yeah!
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:40:07 or to meet one of two requirements, block count or top speed.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:40:25 top speed could be changed for a more suitable requirement on certain ranks.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:40:32 e.g robotics could do that.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:40:56 Speaking of, ornithopters should be eligible for robotics specialist.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:41:30 Though judging by how it's worded it must be a robot capable of walking/running and not flying.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:42:09 Speaking of, I have a ticket open for designer 5 rn. (My ornithopter's score is over 90 rn)
bot-central 2021-07-03 16:47:11 ?rhelp
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:57:05 Not if glitches aren't allowed for that requirement.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:57:30 e.g for the max boat one the speed requirement could be glitchless 250 studs per second.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:14 You can get a boat up to that kind of speed with just thrust?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:43 I think it'd be easier with a paddle lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:08:43 Okay, maybe 250 studs per second is way too slow even for a boat lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:09:16 *Laughs in 300+sps 5 minute paddle boat build.*

It's a functioning ornithopter, adding more detail would make it borderline impossible to get to fly without cheese.

creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:04:30 I didn't "forget" Ever heard of ornithopters hating being heavy? It barely flies as is.
Too much mass makes it impossible to fly with the wings it has, even if helium is added. Respect the limitations of that type of vehicle please.
general 2021-07-05 18:23:38 1 water molecule is dry. 2 or more and it's wet.
general 2021-07-05 18:23:51 Since the water molecules would be covered in water if there's multiple.
general 2021-07-05 18:24:14 Don't question the Fishyfishking's understanding of water and wetness.
general 2021-07-05 18:24:23 A water molecule on it's own is not covered in water.
general 2021-07-05 18:24:25 It is water.
general 2021-07-05 18:24:41 No?
general 2021-07-05 18:25:08 Yo dingus, water isn't an element.
general 2021-07-05 18:25:20 It's a pair of hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
general 2021-07-05 18:25:38 We all know that pee is stored in the walls.

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 12:31:26 I wonder what kind of dumb mechanism I could try to create... Any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:18:42 Instead of adding it all to one map, what if we had a normal mode, pvp mode, and race mode?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:18:54 The race mode being an entirely new map.
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:19:12 btw any opinions on this abomination of mine?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:19:37 It's an ornithopter that flies at almost 400 studs per second.
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:19:52 Can even remain in flight with half of the wings critically damaged.
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:20:09 Rude?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:24:48 Would it be a psychic/fairy type with a lot of dark and poison type moves?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:25:06 Definitely learns fly, surf, and waterfall though
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:25:56 Definitely doesn't resist fire, just tested that. So psychic/fairy works.
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:47:27 I am concerned that my abomination got upvotes.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 14:19:57 I wonder, would ornithopters count for experimental aircraft? I feel like they should.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 14:20:17 If so, this could be my week.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 14:23:34 good
general 2021-07-24 20:58:15 lol
general 2021-07-24 20:58:28 No wonder I'm indestructible. Oof.
general 2021-07-24 21:01:43 idk, the missile and guns aren't that cute.
general 2021-07-30 20:23:12 I just learned that some of the materials seem to have different masses.
general 2021-07-30 20:23:29 I thought that it was purely aesthetic, bar fabric and ice friction.
general 2021-07-30 20:24:11 One of the two lightest blocks surprised me.
general 2021-07-30 20:24:29 Diamond Plate was a bit of a surprise, unlike fabric.
general 2021-07-30 20:25:36 Now I know how to make something excessively light without helium.
general 2021-07-30 20:26:18 uhh....
general 2021-07-30 20:26:56 Did not expect a ballast block on it's lowest setting to be heavier than a standard block... Always thought it was relative to a normal block's mass.
general 2021-07-30 20:27:19 It seems to be about even between fabric and diamond plate, though fabric's friction bonus is work keeping in mind.
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 21:34:30 Needs more plane.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:18:46 Got bored, built a robot that stole one of Jesus's powers.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:18:59 I made a walker that can walk on the surface of water. (no helium)
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:28:53 I am now thoroughly confused. Changing part of the paint on a build somehow made it go roughly 7% faster.
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:34:41 Didn't know it worked on eels.
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:34:52 Also, the paint change was removing a mouth decal
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:35:06 No stripes involved
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:35:47 Also that only applies to ricers, not racers.
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 16:37:05 I've figured out the cause, lag.

help 2021-08-02 08:17:31 That doesn't answer the question then...
help 2021-08-02 08:17:48 I'm asking how people have made turrets that can follow their mouse.
help 2021-08-02 08:23:59 What specific settings on the motor two allow for it to follow your mouse though?
help 2021-08-02 08:24:16 The default for it is F and R?
help 2021-08-02 08:24:40 Weird
help 2021-08-02 08:34:41 Conveyor engine.
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 17:38:10 I wonder what I could build...
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 20:30:51 Is the next contest wet?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 20:35:13 Are you blind, that's clearly an apache attack helicopter.
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 20:47:25 Did they just pull a completely different contest from the voted one out of their rears?
general 2021-11-21 08:38:39 There's a fuel block
general 2021-11-21 08:39:43 You can put more fuel blocks into it.
general 2021-11-21 08:40:14 Correct.
general 2021-11-21 08:40:21 Though you can turn on infinite fuel.
general 2021-11-21 08:40:36 Oh, that I did not know.
general 2021-11-21 08:40:49 Probably because a lot of my builds don't require fuel...
general 2021-11-21 08:41:25 Though my builds aren't like most builds I think.
general 2021-11-21 08:41:41 I mean, anyone else here got a tank that can fly by flapping its wings?
general 2021-11-21 08:41:43 XD
general 2021-12-06 16:39:47 If only they didn't have the "no flying builds" restriction.
general 2021-12-06 16:40:08 Would've been interesting to see how people would handle an ornithopter.
general 2021-12-06 16:40:20 Since the only rule that breaks is the no flying builds rule ^
general 2021-12-06 16:40:28 Doesn't break any block rules.
general 2021-12-06 16:40:31 or glitch usage rules
general 2021-12-06 16:40:53 You'd need to remove at least 3 rules to make shredders legal in that battlebots event Tooty.
general 2021-12-06 16:41:02 Ornithopters would only need one rule removal.
general 2021-12-06 16:41:36 lol
general 2021-12-06 16:51:36 How many cutters do those annoying shredders usually use?
general 2021-12-15 09:08:03 I wonder if PC 2 will be an electric boogaloo.
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 12:16:44 I wonder if ornithopters will be faster in plane crazy 2. Considering the gliding related changes I see it being likely.
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 12:30:53 Read my message again, I never claimed them to be impossible.
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 12:31:11 In fact, the reason I have Expert Designer 5 is an ornithopter lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 12:31:40 I was merely suggesting that ornithopters would be faster in the sequel.
general 2022-10-14 16:38:10 It was meant to come out this Summer, right?
general 2022-10-14 16:39:09 Considering summer was almost a month ago it's coming out around late/please/soon
general 2022-10-14 16:40:20 Who needs virtues? Sins are way cooler.
general 2022-10-14 16:40:55 Which fish do you think caused that law to exist?
general 2022-10-14 16:40:56 Me.
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:49:50 Here's a great digital camo.
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:49:55 Had to make that joke lol
