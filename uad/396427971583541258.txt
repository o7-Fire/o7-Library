general 2021-09-18 21:28:37 LMFAOAOA FORGORED
general 2021-09-18 21:28:58 man
general 2021-09-18 21:29:01 thats not how that works
general 2021-09-18 21:29:07 yeah
general 2021-09-18 21:29:23 english is my first language
general 2021-09-18 21:29:36 not how it works
general 2021-09-18 21:32:29 i would suggest adding a subsurface modifier to the couch if ur going for realism
general 2021-09-18 21:32:33 ill send some of my renders
general 2021-09-18 21:33:21 
general 2021-09-18 21:33:23 thats my newest one
general 2021-09-18 21:34:34 yeah so <@!621817208313479248> some advice i would give would be first to render with CPU if ur gpu is doing that and add a subdivision surface modifier to the couch and TV, also make the walls a different color than the floor
general 2021-09-18 21:34:47 also go into the UV editing tab and make the floor a bit larger
general 2021-09-18 21:34:58 add some ambient light sources for more realistic lighting
general 2021-09-18 21:35:11 like lamps that are out of the shot
general 2021-09-18 21:36:05 add edge creases on the places where u want it to be sharp
general 2021-09-18 21:36:13 so click an edge and do SHIFT+E
general 2021-09-18 21:37:06 and if u want it to be more beveled do shift+b or ctrl+b i dont remember exactly
general 2021-09-18 21:37:11 are u saying its good or bad?
general 2021-09-18 21:37:19 ok
general 2021-09-18 21:37:54 yeah i really like the TV lighting on the couch
general 2021-09-18 21:38:42 what u can do is make the veiwport subdivisions 0 and the render subdivisions like 4 so itll only tax ur PC when rendering
general 2021-09-18 21:38:54 do u know how to use it?
general 2021-09-18 21:39:27 ive been doing it for a couple months, one u learn the basics its really easy to learn, just search stuff up as you go along
general 2021-09-18 21:39:40 the real rickje139
general 2021-09-18 21:39:50 idk its an alt
general 2021-09-18 21:40:01 roblox stfu
general 2021-09-18 21:40:43 search up blenderguru's doughnut tutorial on youtube, learn the basics and go from there, u can do the whole thing but u dont ahve to
general 2021-09-18 21:40:59 yeah np
general 2021-09-18 21:41:46 bevel the arm rests a bit
general 2021-09-18 21:42:48 i really like the table also i just noticed it
general 2021-09-18 21:44:01 what u can do for the couch is use the sculpt tab to make like slight bumps and indents in the couch, you'll have to subdivide the couch geometry a bit by just right clicking some vertexes and clicking subdivide, u dont need to do it that much, like 2 or 3 times
general 2021-09-18 21:46:13 jus the default one should be fine
general 2021-09-18 21:46:17 make the radius large
general 2021-09-18 21:46:31 do u have the whole couch selected?
general 2021-09-18 21:46:39 ok
general 2021-09-18 21:46:55 wait a sec ill show u what to do
general 2021-09-18 21:47:06 let me open up blender

general 2021-09-18 21:48:37 
general 2021-09-18 21:48:47 click subdivide until it looks something like that

general 2021-09-18 21:50:57 after clicking the couch

general 2021-09-18 21:51:59 
general 2021-09-18 21:52:11 yeye just keep clicking subdivide a couple time
general 2021-09-18 21:52:26 ye np
general 2021-09-18 21:52:35 now just use the sculp tool like i said
general 2021-09-18 21:52:40 
general 2021-09-18 21:52:44 make sure its on negative mode
general 2021-09-18 21:53:02 ya

general 2021-09-18 22:04:23 nice man, ill send an idea for a wall material rq
general 2021-09-18 22:04:59 do u want the wall to be like white or what color
general 2021-09-18 22:05:11 ooohh ok
general 2021-09-18 22:05:14 let me find a texutre

general 2021-09-18 22:09:34 
general 2021-09-18 22:09:42 see that little white dot <@!621817208313479248>
general 2021-09-18 22:09:49 thats to make a keyframe
general 2021-09-18 22:09:58 which is what tells the animation what to do and when
general 2021-09-18 22:10:04 it interpolates between keyframes
general 2021-09-18 22:10:24 u can turn off interpolation and mess with the interpolation settings also but i dont think u need that for this yet
general 2021-09-18 22:10:43 so look i clicked the white dot and it made a keyframe on the timeline
general 2021-09-18 22:11:00 so go a couple of frames forward to where u want it to change color next and then change the color and press the keyframe button again (the white dot will be a diamond now)
general 2021-09-18 22:11:40 
general 2021-09-18 22:12:39 ok did u see what i said about how to di it

general 2021-09-18 22:15:05 see how i set a keyfram
general 2021-09-18 22:15:08 for the first frame
general 2021-09-18 22:15:19 the color is white
general 2021-09-18 22:15:37 when 3rd frame i set the color to green and pressed the keyframe button again
general 2021-09-18 22:16:08 yes
general 2021-09-18 22:16:13 but make sure theyre a couple frames apart
general 2021-09-18 22:16:14 so look
general 2021-09-18 22:16:22 before u make another color
general 2021-09-18 22:16:29 go a couple frames forward
general 2021-09-18 22:16:37 see?
general 2021-09-18 22:16:53 just click the blue line and move ur mouse
general 2021-09-18 22:16:59 hold down the mouse button

general 2021-09-18 22:17:17 should have said that lol
general 2021-09-18 22:17:57 these are the interpolation modes u can mess with that if u want just rightclick the keyframe
general 2021-09-18 22:18:05 but u dont need to for what ur doing rn
general 2021-09-18 22:19:20 make sure ur end time is set to like 10 frames or something
general 2021-09-18 22:19:24 
general 2021-09-18 22:19:55 ya
general 2021-09-18 22:20:01 so the animation will be longer
general 2021-09-18 22:20:05 see i set it to 50 now its shorter
general 2021-09-18 22:22:32 im gonna make a wall material for u with a normal map
general 2021-09-18 22:28:14 <@!621817208313479248>

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:35:49 how u finna get it tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:36:14 they dont even check when people apply for inventor i dont think
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:36:17 or i thought they didnt
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:36:38 how would you invent something tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:36:48 that would be extremely hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:37:37 user?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:37:40 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:14 how is that a spelling mistake
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:37 thats grammar
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:39 not spelling
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:49 no its not
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:39:10 grammar is the organization of your words spelling is how you organize letters into a word
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:39:42 i dont think it was one person

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:42:03 in an arrangement
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:42:23 it is sick tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:43:11 ok true
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:43:54 but i think most people who have inventor rank found out a way to use the games blocks to manipulate game mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:44:02 thats what motor lock is
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:44:59 wave machine?

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:11:45 aren't aerodynamics and hydrodynamics pretty similar
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:11:56 water and air are both fluids
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:12:23 yeah but gas acts like a fluid
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:12:28 it has fluidity
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:12:41 it does
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:12:59 
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:13:04 ^^
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:14:31 a ferry's engine and a propeller plane's engine create thrust in essentially the same way
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:14:58 space has pretty much no density
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:15:17 because theres so few molecules floating around
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:16:29 mate if you're basing it off of the density of space thats like saying "why don't space shuttles just fall to the ground"
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:16:58 well no
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:17:09 i was talking to the other guy
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:17:32 i know i was just saying
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:17:33 also
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:17:41 yeah it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:18:02 so is pretty much everything relative to space
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:19:03 is space completely absent of mass
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:19:25 yeah thats how black holes work
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:19:38 no there IS dark matter we just dont know what it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:20:10 no that would be impossible
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 05:20:23 there would be no gravity

general 2021-09-22 05:25:28 yo when was motor lock invented?
general 2021-09-22 05:25:48 damn its been around for that long?
general 2021-09-22 05:26:03 thats pretty long for a game feature like that
general 2021-09-22 05:26:05 if you think about it
general 2021-09-22 05:26:12 3 years
general 2021-09-22 05:26:28 you should make that
general 2021-09-22 05:26:42 yeah lol
general 2021-09-22 05:27:05 nah
general 2021-09-22 05:27:19 that would be cool but will kinda ruin the whole point of it
general 2021-09-22 05:28:00 didn't he say our old builds will be saved?
general 2021-09-22 05:28:23 ok then that means motor lock will still exist and work the same in pc2
general 2021-09-22 05:28:45 yeah
general 2021-09-22 05:29:02 build a boat limits ur creativity
general 2021-09-22 05:30:06 yeah
general 2021-09-22 05:30:33 yeah thats how most things are created
general 2021-09-22 05:30:57 people still fold
general 2021-09-22 05:31:39 motor locking and piston locking especially are the most glitchy pos sometimes
general 2021-09-22 05:31:57 i really like them
general 2021-09-22 05:32:16 nah motor locking isnt glitchy its pistons i should have said
general 2021-09-22 05:32:26 they are fine if u know what ur doing
general 2021-09-22 05:32:27 no
general 2021-09-22 05:32:28 locking
general 2021-09-22 05:32:52 the main thing about pistons is that they kinda glitch out when u spawn them in
general 2021-09-22 05:32:56 atleast i notice that
general 2021-09-22 05:33:07 i found ways around it tho
general 2021-09-22 05:33:22 no
general 2021-09-22 05:33:35 if u lock a motor 2 inside a motor lock then yes
general 2021-09-22 05:33:55 just angle lock for that
general 2021-09-22 05:34:01 wait nvm
general 2021-09-22 05:34:02 lol
general 2021-09-22 05:34:24 rotating locked motors breaks my builds
general 2021-09-22 05:34:38 i have my motors set to 8 and 9 to rotate them so it never really happens tho
general 2021-09-22 05:34:50 yeah
general 2021-09-22 05:35:03 how do you unpower angle locked motors

creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:33:34 side profile (not perfect lock btw)
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:35:48 nah i think its pretty accurate so far, itll look a bit longer when the rudder and wings. the afterburners i have on my plane rn are just temporary btw
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:38:03 oh yeah i just realized the intakes are quite long, gonna fix change the intake from a 1x3 wedge to a 1x2, should help it a bit

<@!723940197456281640> alright im gonna do that rq
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:40:19 im gonna fix the nose

how do u guys think i should improve the nose, add a bit of angle lock to it maybe?

i see
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:42:47 alright guys thx for the feedback, im gonna work on it later tho its a lot of work <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

the f14 is such a cool plane
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:45:06 yeah i was actually thinking the canopy was a bit weird, since the back seat wasnt really fitting into the plane that well
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:47:15 all I can say so far is to change the lights to something other than books, can you show us a different angle?

okay definitely lock the guns into the car instead of having them on the front
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:51:22 ooohh, okay that makes a bit more sense, maybe make them pop out a bit less

actually pretty smart how u used the tips of the guns as headlights, i might use that for something
