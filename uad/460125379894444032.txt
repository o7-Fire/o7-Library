general 2023-07-12 07:12:26 idea to grab others builds?
general 2023-07-12 07:21:59 stability is the issue
general 2023-07-12 07:22:03 tried pistons
general 2023-07-12 07:22:18 also if you just use a bunch of friction blocks it doesnt pickup

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:06:51 welp i just tped into the void and went mach 30 after jumping down and clicking jetpack, think i saw this happen on someone elses channel
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:30:50 one day we hope
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:31:39 bouta say that
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:32:10 tbh nothing for now beats play crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:32:42 besides pvp, plane crazy pvp is a shitty hellscape
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:34:13 only at about 900 blocks out of probably 5k+ and my private server is shitting itself when i spawn and despawn this thing
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:34:21 too advanced
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:34:46 you really bored of pc?
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:35:05 you built mechs?

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:36:49 building big stuff that works as you intended is satisfying
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:36:58 i dont enjoy building small builds

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:39:18 got a private server?
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 03:40:33 if you cant focus while building maybe try using a private server, just bought one and ive gotten so much more done on my mech

plane-crazy 2023-07-14 01:36:31 just realized, i shouldnt be folding at the joints of the hips
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 01:36:35 first time folding a mech
general 2023-07-14 01:47:02 ways to get rid of the motor when folding?
general 2023-07-14 01:47:20 cat
general 2023-07-14 01:47:30 dove tail joints?
general 2023-07-14 01:47:55 magnets?
general 2023-07-14 01:49:05 oh so rotate it into place, lock it in with something like trap doors and then disconnect the motor?
general 2023-07-14 01:49:16 that might work
general 2023-07-14 01:49:43 alr thanks
