plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:43:09 Missiles can be a versatile weapon in plane crazy. They can be launched from anywhere and can hit almost anything. Some creations has two missiles that are use for hitting land targets, other ships, or sometimes, even planes! As missiles are made out of parts, unlike rockets, they can be launched underwater and can hit targets underwater. Missiles can be used to attack and kill shredders.

They can be steered, unlike rockets, which makes it much easier to hit planes and moving targets. The only problem is that missiles are often much bigger than rockets and can't be replenished. although they are much more versatile than rockets, missiles also must be manually steered, but the user can still use weapons while launching one if the missile has weapons on it.

Types
Missiles come in many different sizes and shapes. There are many variations, as the missile is a simple idea with many ways to create. There are a lot of ways missiles can be made, so new missile types are being made all the time. Missiles can be easily made to fit your vehicle, and can be tooled around with greatly.

Tutorial
First, place a super rocket engine facing the front of your planned missile. Place 1x1 delta wings on each side of the cylindrical part of the super rocket engine and 1x1 control surfaces below those delta wings. Place seven blocks of explosives ahead of the rocket. one block down from the top, place 1x1 delta wings, and 1x1 control surfaces below the delta wings. Then place another set of delta wings and control surfaces directly below the last set. Finally, place a camera on top. If you want to attach the missile to something, place the detachers on the lowest explosive block.


Putting missiles on creations
To put missiles on creations you can use 2 or 3 disconnectors to connect them on the build. Make sure that the disconnectors have their top plates facing on the missile. (ie: the disconnectors must look like top hats.) after that you are done.
