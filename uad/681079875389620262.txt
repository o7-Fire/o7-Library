general 2021-11-24 03:12:04 theres uh someone talking about killing cats in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:57:30 this game kinda needs decal blocks, right?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 06:14:28 theres a bug or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 06:16:32 placed some wheels on my car
then they broke
it doesent want to steer correctly because both tires in the front and back turn the same way
i replaced them and rejoined but they still do the same thing
i tried configurating them which did work, but they didnt work the same way when they were automatically configurated by the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 06:17:39 i remember this bug happening years ago too
so i assume it wasnt fixed
