plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:32:33 Do any of you guys have tips for making fold up ships?
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:33:33 it only complicated building tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:33:58 refrence pic?
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:34:02 Im good at building guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:34:39 i came up with the ingenious idea of adding trusters to the end of cylinders since actual cannon barrels with projectiles dont exist yet! >:I
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:35:00 The small ones or the big guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:35:15 ill see what i can do
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:35:32 Just gimme a minute to make them
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:36:14 For me it was a giant leap
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:36:29 "small step for the comunity
Huge step for a new builder"
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:36:57 <@!435946988559925248> What size is the ship gona be
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:37:04 Like, a fold up ship?

plane-crazy 2020-02-21 21:45:10 <@434989303882579981> Maybe you should stop trashtalking and shut up, If i want to make a beyblade i can make a beyblade, The game has unlimited build options so if your trying to ruin it think again your ruining someones playtime... uncool
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 21:46:32 Not a lag machine

plane-crazy 2020-02-24 16:01:56 To play music and stuff
general 2021-01-13 12:45:54 if i make a tilt rotor aircraft (can fly like a prop plane but can tilt props backwards to fly like a helicopter) could i be able to get both the vtol AND the plane build ranks?
general 2021-01-13 12:46:34 holy shnitzel cool
general 2021-01-13 12:46:38 thats cool
bot-central 2021-01-13 12:47:34 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-01-13 12:47:47 ?rhelp
general 2021-01-13 12:48:46 if i was to make a tilt rotor aircraft would i be able to apply for both aeronautical engineer and vtol engineer?
general 2021-01-13 12:50:07 i'd make tiny robots, paint em green, give em guns and make a plastic army men army
general 2021-01-13 12:52:02 OBJECTIVE: OBTAIN THEM ALL WITH ONE VEHICLE
general 2021-01-13 12:52:25 a rocket that has multi stages and in it is a vehicle that can fly vtol and normal and sail and drive
general 2021-01-13 12:53:52 bro i want a tool that allows you to draw custom lines
general 2021-01-13 12:54:05 to make the windows on aircraft with frames and such
general 2021-01-13 12:54:34 because some aircraft have metal pipes and stuff running trough the windshield
general 2021-01-13 12:54:38 i want to recreate that
general 2021-01-13 13:09:51 do tracks count as detached from a creation?
general 2021-01-13 13:09:54 like custom tracks
general 2021-01-13 21:31:58 Has anybody been able to get every single vehicle building rank with one vehicle?
general 2021-01-13 21:32:40 <@456226577798135808> you can get multiple per vehicle i think
general 2021-01-13 21:33:32 Im going for VTOL engineer V and aeronautical engineer V with ma tilt rotor aircraft :)
general 2021-01-13 21:34:11 The cockpit is 500 blocks <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-01-13 21:34:39 I've made a prototype hangar door i wana put in the vehicle and it works
general 2021-01-13 21:34:51 And is 180 blocks
general 2021-01-13 21:35:45 And i think that an entire body with radar decorations, a small vehicle bay, storage crates and 4 tilt rotor props later ill be hitting the 3k mark
general 2021-01-13 21:36:28 MADATTAK
help 2021-01-14 12:10:17 anyone know how to make good looking cargo bay doors?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 13:24:49 Can we have actual tank tracks so tanks dont lag
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 13:25:01 Red
general 2021-01-17 08:20:59 Tilt rotors can be a heli
general 2021-01-17 08:21:02 And a prop plane
general 2021-01-17 08:21:13 A heli and a prop plane cant be a tilt rotor
general 2021-01-17 08:22:15 To be a tilt rotor you must be able to fly with both upwards thrust alone and forward thrust alone
general 2021-01-17 08:23:02 Yes it does
general 2021-01-17 08:23:06 Thats a tilt rotor
general 2021-01-17 08:23:30 They do just not enough to qualify as a tilt rotor
general 2021-01-17 08:24:00 But helis arent tilt rotor
general 2021-01-17 08:24:16 Yes
general 2021-01-17 08:24:22 Shut
general 2021-01-17 08:24:28 Not enough to be tilt rotor
general 2021-01-17 08:25:06 Thats tilt, just not enough to qualify as a true tilt rotor
