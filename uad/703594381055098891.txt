creations-chat 2020-11-27 11:46:00 i tried to make it as clean as possible
i hid some propeller blades that acted like downforce inside the place where the engine is supposed to be

thats my building style so ye
creations-chat 2020-11-27 11:49:13 its hard to make the exterior very clean and i had to think for a couple of minutes just to find a way to add downforce to it while maintaining the neatness of the exterior

creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:03:30 I stated it there:
> P.S. This is not meant to be an exact replica.
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:05:36 The reason why I put "P.S. This is not meant to be an exact replica." was because I thought:
"hmm, someone for sure will downvote because of the scale but i purposely didnt make the scale perfect, so lemme add that in"
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:07:50 nah just say it
i rather learn from others than stick with the issues my rocket/droneship has while being unaware
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:10:10 oh for that i purposely made it fixed since its meant to work like the f9r dev
pls dont take this as an "excuse". i just purposely did it, but i will probably look more into that in the future. thanks <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:13:03 your work is good and i appreciate your effort.
pls dont take this personally, but i dont rlly like the look of the wings/propeller blades being exposed outside
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:16:29 i think i'll stick with the "hidden downforce"
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:18:22 and i'm awfully sorry if i, in any way, hurt your feelings after rejecting your suggestion.

On a lonely planet, slowly spinning its way to damnation.
Amid the incompetence and unpreparedness of lesser space programs.
One team stands resilient against the herds.
Putting their lives on the line to aid those who were previously unaware of the quicksave option.
Yes, it's the incredible adventures of Jebediah and his crack team of Kerbalnauts.
They are, The Blunderbirds!
Saving the Kerbin race one stranded explorer at a time.

general 2020-11-28 17:59:59 hes trolling
general 2020-11-28 18:00:52 hoho so landing a booster and saving $30,000,000 instead of letting the booster crash down into the ocean is bad, ok noted

its their style
they will only start manned missions after a lot of unmanned ones prob
general 2020-11-28 18:22:23 like the falcon 9

general 2020-12-26 09:54:59 oh crap theres multiple kpop fans
general 2020-12-26 09:55:07 for the sake of my own safety i will get out of this place
general 2020-12-26 09:59:28 especially in singapore
general 2020-12-26 09:59:52 philippines still has some christmas spirit i think
general 2020-12-26 10:00:12 no earth is saturn's ring
general 2020-12-26 10:00:37 <@!536013994188865554> u in singapore?
general 2020-12-26 10:00:48 oh
general 2020-12-26 10:00:51 singapore its controlled
general 2020-12-26 10:00:56 we had 10 new cases today
general 2020-12-26 10:01:05 and we still have 1 meter social distancing
general 2020-12-26 10:01:09 with a compulsory mask
general 2020-12-26 10:01:32 but we have 0 community cases
all our cases nowadays are imported
general 2020-12-26 10:01:58 the reason why we have cases is because we are starting to open up more bc our economy and singapore airlines is dying
general 2020-12-26 10:02:43 because the government is also broke
general 2020-12-26 10:02:45 duh
general 2020-12-26 10:03:00 nah
general 2020-12-26 10:03:04 all those are lies
general 2020-12-26 10:03:09 our government is big brain
general 2020-12-26 10:03:11 we are saving money
general 2020-12-26 10:03:16 they dont want to spend yet
general 2020-12-26 10:03:25 we are prepared for the worst if it comes
general 2020-12-26 10:03:42 put it this way:
singapore is rich but the people are slightly above average or smth
general 2020-12-26 10:04:25 cost of living here is high tho

general 2021-01-02 08:25:33 aw man im sad that adobe flash player is gone
general 2021-01-02 08:25:36 my childhood
general 2021-01-02 08:28:09 there should be no rules in plane crazy tbh (except for no inappropriate things)
general 2021-01-02 08:28:28 if u are not happy that ur server has people with shredder bugs or smth then join another
general 2021-01-02 08:28:34 - said some guy i met
general 2021-01-02 08:30:08 btw whats the difference between turning off 'self protection' in cutters and turning them on
general 2021-01-02 08:30:11 im a bit confusion
general 2021-01-02 08:30:46 do u usually turn it on or off
general 2021-01-02 08:31:51 ferris wheel
general 2021-01-02 08:36:27 imagine if we had lasers that would be op but if its not pvp then it would look cool af
general 2021-01-08 08:29:09 https://i.imgflip.com/4t0x51.jpg
general 2021-01-10 11:06:12 we need a bigger port bc our port is tiny lol
general 2021-01-10 11:07:46 what about rocket launch site
i know some of you will say "why not build your own", but it would look more natural if the launch site is next to the sea, far away from the other things
general 2021-01-10 11:08:52 not the launchpad, just the location
general 2021-01-10 11:11:59 fuck saying fuck
general 2021-01-10 11:15:05 we should be able to control the length of the rocket engine particles bc they are very short
general 2021-01-10 11:15:18 irl they are like, 50 meters long or smth depending on the engine
general 2021-01-10 11:17:02 as a rocket enthusiast or whatever u call that crap, i think that would be unecessary
general 2021-01-10 11:17:03 like u said
general 2021-01-10 11:17:10 "just set to 0 gravity and night"
general 2021-01-10 11:17:31 if u wanna die in space, press escape, r and then click reset
general 2021-01-10 11:20:05 In **C**razy **C**razy **C**razy **P**lane, how would it know what is inside and outside.
general 2021-01-10 11:20:28 there is no inside or outside
general 2021-01-10 11:20:30 there is only
general 2021-01-10 11:20:32 OUR SIDE
general 2021-01-10 11:20:40 ~~JOIN THE CCCP~~
general 2021-01-10 11:22:05 not even ksp knows whats inside and outside (except for prebuilt modules), so how do you expect plane crazy to do it
general 2021-01-10 11:26:09 crane prazy

general 2021-01-10 11:27:12 ok *usoon*
general 2021-01-10 11:27:24 does plane crazy have inertia

plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:41:17 does anybody know how to make corner wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:41:52 or is it not possible
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:43:59 anyone?
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:46:15 its like, a corner wedge
but its made for 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:46:30 triangle wedge wont work
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:46:36 corner wedge is different from triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:51:40 <@!774377045346091008>
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:53:08 it wont work
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:53:28 theres no corner wedge 1x2 tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:54:57 why is there left corner wedge 1x2 but there is no corner wedge 1x2 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:55:21 ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:55:51 wont work obv
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:56:52 there will be a hole
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:57:02 or smth
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:57:57 but it will look weird
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:59:19 
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 11:59:29 thats what happens if you use a triangle wedge 1x2 there
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:00:03 i did
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:00:24 no matter what you do, if a triangle wedge 1x2 is in that position, it wont work
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:00:55 what are you even picturing
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:01:36 but thats not the template of my build
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:02:56 the reason why i dont wanna put triangle wedge block is bc the interior is limited
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:05:42 ill just change the top completely
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:05:50 thanks and sorry for taking your time

general 2021-11-14 12:01:29 i got banned for 7 days for saying a word that was *tagged*
