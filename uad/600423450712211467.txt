creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:05:31 is bro seriously malding about downvotes
creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:09:41 and also, its probably not a very friendly gesture to ask people who downvoted why they downvoted in a rather agressive manner
creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:13:57 to shorten it up : cope
creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:19:48 your message doesnt show it:
Can someone give me a reason why my bus is getting downvoted? its literally my build. 
honestly , tell me. what's wrong with it? you think i stole it? well no , it is clearly my build and it will stay that way , now describe what's so wrong about it <@695976690915999784> , how about he tells us what's wrong? 
it clearly asks one of the dudes who downvoted it in an agressive manner
general 2023-03-05 19:55:39 ngl at this point they're gonna say pc2 is cancelled
general 2023-03-05 19:56:29 wake up from your dreams
