general 2022-12-29 12:47:58 smaller track maybe

general 2022-12-29 12:49:02 true
general 2022-12-29 12:49:06 as a railfan it kinda sucks
general 2022-12-29 12:49:28 I dont expect overhead wires for the trains or something
general 2022-12-29 12:49:36 but at least more in scale train track would be cool
general 2022-12-29 12:49:57 agreed
general 2022-12-29 12:50:28 Imagine finally smaller train tracks!!1
general 2022-12-29 12:50:42 no more 1:1 trains on plot
general 2022-12-29 12:51:58 well thing is rickje

general 2022-12-29 12:52:15 so people who made trains in pc 1
general 2022-12-29 12:52:20 can still use them on the old map

general 2022-12-29 13:12:30 other 4
general 2022-12-29 13:12:35 it was kinda split
general 2022-12-29 13:12:47 fr
general 2022-12-29 13:13:00 i always did 3 blocks and at each side add half blocks
general 2022-12-29 13:13:03 so 4 block wide
general 2022-12-29 13:13:27 I dont expect narrow gauge in plane crazy 2
general 2022-12-29 13:13:37 thats way to much for a building game like this
