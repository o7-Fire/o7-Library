plane-crazy 2021-04-30 16:27:01 When building things like planes, what's the build priority? Do you like start at the nose and finish at the tail, or start with the cockpit and wings?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 16:28:08 Okay.
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 17:08:12 When do you use control surfaces and when you use wings with motor 2's?
