plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:44:29 I might need some help, i am trying to create a functional artillery with TNT balls.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:45:14 Thats not the problem
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:45:47 Its uh kinda too sensitive
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:47:01 So its impossible to create an autoloading SPG?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:47:09 Dang
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 16:50:52 Wait i forgot to add the "with tnt balls" part
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:51:38 Such is life
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:53:23 i usually do it because i am too lazy to create a design that looks good
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:55:48 > Design could correspond with how things work well
Just gonna take some time
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:57:10 I am not really familiar with motor locking to be fair
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:58:12 <@!563462654090543114> Yeah, but its either complicated or too simple
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:03:32 <@!720024036863901717> you mean this one? 746383586755870821

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 17:08:44 Oh, i got an A-4 Douglas looking aircraft, i believe it outruns them i think.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 17:09:42 <@!513281785736593439> I saw one of those, to be fair its quite easy to take them out.
