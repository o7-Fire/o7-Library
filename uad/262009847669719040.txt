creations-chat 2020-03-21 22:44:10 also i don't really see the point in a 2x2 motor
creations-chat 2020-03-21 22:44:21 wouldn't it just make the same output but be larger?
creations-chat 2020-03-21 22:44:53 what we really need is a motor aligned to the center of 2 blocks
creations-chat 2020-03-21 22:51:05 ok
creations-chat 2020-03-22 01:35:59 After some testing, I made a better version of the F1, with a longer top fin and more damping to the suspension. Average lap time is 19.81 seconds, and fastest lap is 19.08 seconds. Keep in mind this thing is made for handling and lap times, not looks.
creations-chat 2020-03-22 01:36:31 sort of

creations-chat 2021-09-13 01:14:16 it doesn't take nearly as much effort to make a broken one as a fully functional one

creations-chat 2021-09-14 23:03:14 it was originally bc it looked like a fish so i went for tropical underwater look then it was the base for the plane

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:27:08 i was setting controls and randomly saw "mousemovements" appear briefly whilst clicking around, is it really possible to set it like this and how?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:27:58 huh
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:28:17 yup thats the thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 19:46:10 has anyone else used this weird setup with conveyers?
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 19:48:57 it just produces stupid amounts of speed irrespective of weight.
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:32:18 you sure? it seems so simple and effective, surely someone would have discovered it by now?
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:40:13 sort of
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:40:16 i think at least
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:40:34 it is basically a conveyer on a piston that is touching the rest of the craft
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:40:59 when the conveyer is activated it thrusts the whole thing with a force that is directly from the center of the craft
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 20:42:47 upon looking it up it looks like it is a known thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 23:00:55 reaching the zero point with a conveyer-drive rocket
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 23:01:06 so far i found out at some height conveyers will just stop working entirely
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 23:01:39 too bad the altitude doesn't go past like 10000
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 23:01:48 otherwise i could see where i am

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 23:56:18 oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:20:09 i don't understand: besides detailed recreations, why would you use a plane and not something more like this, a symmetrical almost "tube" like craft?
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:20:47 (functionally speaking at least)
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:21:39 *all of them press all the shiny buttons yes the buttons*
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:22:13 who needs plane when have flying tube?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:26:56 the sides are wings motorlocked to be flush with the frame, if you look closely you can see control surfaces on the edge of each stub, and inside there are conveyer drives

creations-chat 2023-02-20 23:42:18 it has a locking mechanism for stability & release mechanisms to make sure none of the other shots get pushed out as well https://gyazo.com/54641b8f0ca3b916842f5f63897e05ec
creations-chat 2023-02-20 23:44:36 though rotation is slow and the locking mechanism takes a while to settle https://gyazo.com/c2cad1aa4a20a41b9eed2b70859da341
creations-chat 2023-02-21 05:26:48 magnets & a line of tnt balls in a turret made of trapdoors
creations-chat 2023-02-21 05:29:10 there is no "pusher", the magnets just push the projectiles from the beginning and end
creations-chat 2023-02-21 05:31:22 the one in the back is weaker than the one in the front making a consistent stream of projectiles for a fraction of a second
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 02:15:27 i think that the point where collision stops working (very high in the sky) can be considered space in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 02:23:28 it is also fitting since at that point conveyer engines stop working, being a parallel to thrusters at lower altitudes not working in space
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 02:38:12 space is painful
