bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:03:12 Hello everyone, I would like to make some dishonorable mentions to these 2 players for their displayed toxic behavior:
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:03:30 Their usernames: RainSticks
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:03:34 and
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:03:51 plasmiczone
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:04:26 do whatever you desire to them if you encounter them
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:04:33 good day
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:06:23 yes
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:07:48 They started becoming verbally aggressive after I was landing some air-to-air kills on them
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:08:38 I'll keep that in mind
bug-reports 2022-03-26 00:08:55 Thank you for your consideration

general 2023-01-06 15:58:38 I’m planning on creating a plane crazy aerobatics group based off the Russian Swifts mig 29 ovt demo team
general 2023-01-06 16:01:32 💀
general 2023-01-06 16:04:10 <@332102654392139788> the majority of jet users in plane crazy don’t even have the reflexes to start shooting someone when they’re doing a cobra in a highspeed fight

plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:03:11 <@332102654392139788> I wanna see a video on how that f14 performs in su 47 mode
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:05:05 A mig or Sukhoi of any type is the go to for pvp aircraft

plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:11:08 What’s the closest we can get to a TLS in plane crazy?

plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:15:21 Same with me
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:16:24 The fact that the the f22’s first air to air kill decades after its introduction is just a balloon <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:22:33 You mean that by plane crazy’s control surfaces or custom control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:23:04 Problem solved, just use glitched mouse
creations-chat 2023-02-10 17:25:30 Is solo even online?
creations-chat 2023-02-10 18:00:42 I was gonna add something else “gjsolo styled” to the description of my build but it was too inappropriate and I don’t wanna get banned 💀
