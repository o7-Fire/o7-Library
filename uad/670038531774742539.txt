help 2022-08-19 20:48:27 Hey I need some help.
help 2022-08-19 20:49:38 I made myself a Destroyer, I need a reliable way to power this ship with the least parts. So I went for a conveyor drive.
help 2022-08-19 20:50:19 However, I use super rocket engines to turn my ship.
help 2022-08-19 20:50:32 But the second I make the slighest left or right turn, my ship capsizes.
help 2022-08-19 20:51:10 I used rocket engines to reach the same speed setting of 30 knots with the same amount of rocket engines to manage the turns. My ship does not capsize.
help 2022-08-19 20:51:33 It seems my ship only capsizes when I use conveyor drive to power it.
help 2022-08-19 20:55:59 So like have the motor 2 point the engine up a little?
help 2022-08-19 20:57:29 <@710919070236672170> You mind joining me to see the issue?
help 2022-08-19 21:00:06 My ship is also listing to one side despite it being even in my opinion.
help 2022-08-19 21:00:20 And the parts that are uneven is so small it shouldn't even matter.
help 2022-08-19 21:31:46 Its on the waterline.
help 2022-08-19 21:31:57 
help 2022-08-19 21:33:38 The height of the hull is 13 blocks, the width of the hull is 15 blocks.
help 2022-08-19 21:34:19 The height of the bridge tower to the bottom of the hull (excluding the mast) is 21.
help 2022-08-19 21:35:02 I put pontoons on the waterloo to make it float up to the waterline. Without it, the ship would sink down another layer of block.
help 2022-08-19 21:36:43 I hate Helium
help 2022-08-19 21:36:58 That crap flies away if the supports holding it dies in PVP
help 2022-08-19 21:37:36 I also have an entire interior <@710919070236672170>
help 2022-08-19 21:37:47 On the deck just above the water.
help 2022-08-19 21:37:55 So I don't think the height is an issue.
