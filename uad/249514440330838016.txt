plane-crazy 2018-12-06 20:45:26 Hello everyone.
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 20:46:23 Oi, I got an idea! Should I try to make a ball that has a Vtol inside that turns 360Â° on all directions. But the outer ball stays compleatly still.
general 2018-12-07 03:17:20 <:despacito:518431419874410506>
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:08:01 Quick guestion, can the Propeller master rank VTOL use motors?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:08:09 Probably not now that I think of it.

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:22:09 Hello.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:22:29 But do you know if the propeller master rank use motors?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 10:24:30 Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
creations-chat 2018-12-07 10:24:36 Well now I know.
creations-chat 2018-12-07 10:24:55 Btw <@!386974424538152960> Can you use motors in the "propeller master" Rank build?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 10:25:40 Well that makes it much easier.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:29:24 Thank you.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:29:29 Makes it much easier.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:30:25 Alright.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:30:29 Still, makes it easier.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:30:44 I already made a Vtol only using normal thrusters.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:30:56 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:31:42 Nice.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:31:58 I might make like a 2 propellor plane.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:32:11 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:36:08 Bugs?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:36:28 Check if the spotlight settings are fine.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:37:10 That looks cool af.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:37:30 I wish I could even build anything remotely cool looking as that.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:38:58 I like it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:40:22 Noice.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 10:45:09 Or jealous people who don't want others to win.
creations-chat 2018-12-07 10:48:16 Thank you.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:03:04 I got an amazing idea for my propeller master build, thanks to <@446749948130754576>
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:03:42 Tysm.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:12:23 So hey, wont the Steampunker engineer builds basically just be hovers?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:13:30 Oooh.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:13:35 So...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:13:41 Zeppelin?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:13:46 That would be a fun ideam
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:13:49 Idea*
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:14:11 But would be hard to build one that uses 2000+ blocks...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:14:27 Send screenshots from other angles.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:25:01 <@458451488335986688> I got a pretty good image of the thing I am gonna build in my head, and I already forgot what yiur thing looked like.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:25:19 Probsbly.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:25:28 Wouldn't be that hard to do tbh.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:27:02 I could probably make a functioning X-wing, but I am gonna try and get some ranks first.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:28:09 I got an amazing idea for the inventor build aswell.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:28:15 It will be very hard tho.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:29:18 I'm gonna try and make like a Vtol that is a ball, and has a rotating smaller ball inside.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:29:29 And it would power the whole thing.
help 2018-12-07 11:30:21 Just add more propellor wings.
help 2018-12-07 11:30:52 Motor -> block -> propellor wings.
help 2018-12-07 11:31:11 You can add propellor wings to other propellor wings.
help 2018-12-07 11:31:15 Make them longer.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:31:33 Kinda.
help 2018-12-07 11:31:46 Post an SS.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:32:17 But I am gonna focus on the propellor master first.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 11:49:03 As you wish: "Good luck!"
general 2018-12-07 11:53:28 What are you gonna try to get?
general 2018-12-07 11:53:47 I am aiming for the propeller master currently.
general 2018-12-07 11:54:08 And then I might go for master replicator.
general 2018-12-07 11:54:24 And I also got a solid idea for 2 ranks in one build thing.
general 2018-12-07 11:55:03 I will make an aircraft carrier that has an inventor worthy mechanism.
general 2018-12-07 11:55:22 Want to know what the mechanism is?
general 2018-12-07 11:56:09 I will make a 2 story aircraft carrier, but the 2 stories are lifted by an elevator.
general 2018-12-07 11:56:31 Should take a few hours.
help 2018-12-07 11:56:44 Color.
general 2018-12-07 11:57:42 Then you will not get the rank.
general 2018-12-07 11:57:47 Jkjkjkjk.
general 2018-12-07 11:58:12 It will probably boost your chances.
general 2018-12-07 11:59:20 Noice.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:00:44 Btw, can you only have 1 rank from each gategory except special?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:01:25 Don't buy a gaming laptop.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:01:33 Buy a mini itx PC
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:01:43 As compact and more powerful
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:01:48 And also cheaper.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:01:58 Why..
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:02:07 They are overpriced as hell.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:02:41 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:02:55 Do you go outside much?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:03:14 Or do you use your laptop elsewhere than your home?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:06:27 Ew...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:08:42 What is that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:09:33 Century = 100 years.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:09:39 You mean centurion?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:10:01 That isn't really centry either.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:10:18 Looks like a crazy dog lady walking her dogs :D
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:10:51 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:10:57 Hello swiss.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:11:02 Good idea!
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:11:18 Never actually thought of that.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:30:12 Flame, I'm kind of confosed, what do you nees to do for megacarrier?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:30:18 Confused*
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 12:30:43 <@264769733021270016>

creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:55:31 Took me a few hours to make up a design, and a few minutes to build it - my build for the propeller master rank.

creations-chat 2018-12-08 15:02:33 And I also tried to make a plane first.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:03:50 Btw, what do ballast blocks do?
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:04:12 Ooooh, aight.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:04:52 <#501059272675688468>
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:05:48 And btw, for the steampunker builds: Can they use thrusters to manuever the height.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:06:01 If it just uses the helium to stay airborne.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:29:54 Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:30:52 Magnets, motors and pistons.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:30:58 That could work.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:33:39 I could try and make the Titanic.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:34:36 Pretty simple.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:35:21 Lol, it broke?

plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:48:45 Don't put them on both sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:49:03 Find out which way the top propeller turns your build.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:49:14 Then make a propeller that counters that movement.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:49:25 I can show you soon.

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:07 James-
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:24 Would I get a steampunker rank if my build hovers using helium.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:31 But it goes up and down using motors.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:41 Like it hovers in place with helium.
