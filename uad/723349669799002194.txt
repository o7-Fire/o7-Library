plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:10:20 How did I just get the summer event 2019 badge… when it’s 2021
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:14:25 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:14:40 Check to make sure their on
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:14:51 And make sure it’s not locked
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:15:34 Very true
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:15:53 Theirs a motor lock option
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:16:13 Pretty much prevents it from moving
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:16:52 Is the motor being blocked by anything
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:17:27 or the thing it’s trying to rotate is connected to the part that the motor is hooked to
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:17:40 Can you send them to me also
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 21:19:28 It looks like the motors might be rotating against eachother
