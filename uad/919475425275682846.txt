The Tale of Cheese_Cube (919475425275682846)
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:46:59 Very epic, almost nobody makes the jagdtiger
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 17:47:31 Indeed
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:00:07 Are we allowed to do different models of the Merkava such as the Merkava II (favorite variant) or does it have to be the Merkava IV
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:02:51 Alright thank you, have a good day.
creations-chat 2022-03-26 22:43:23 they are actually different photos
creations-chat 2022-03-26 22:45:28 Vertical stabilizers are different aswell and other details very subtle changes but indeed different photos.
plane-crazy 2022-03-27 05:22:13 It doesnâ€™t track targets when itâ€™s within range it just keeps going straight, however the plus side to it is they do more damage
plane-crazy 2022-03-27 05:23:00 Pretty much Cons: difficult to hit targets, Pros: More damage.
bot-central 2022-03-27 05:49:29 -servers
bot-central 2022-03-27 05:49:47 ok well now I know what servers is
plane-crazy 2022-03-27 06:22:14 alright then, I just simply went by what like 3 different people told me. Thank you for letting me know.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 04:58:53 <@!410455661814480896> this is nowhere near to scale
creations-chat 2022-03-28 05:01:20 It could be classified as a mini build. I have seen at least 50-60 A-10s both in flight and on the ground and they are massive.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 05:06:14 Itâ€™s honestly kind of an illusion because some seem a lot larger then they really are and than there are some that seem a lot smaller then they are.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 05:10:46 Itâ€™s really only different because you failed at copying.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 05:19:20 Not everything.
creations-chat 2022-03-30 14:54:06 Welp I personally thinks itâ€™s pretty good, so keep up the good work.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:32 Probably the fact that plane crazy is falling apart and thereâ€™s been reported bugs with the build tool.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:46 At least from what Iâ€™ve heard
creations-chat 2022-04-07 06:07:45 I mean your not right but your also not wrong. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got, have a great day.
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:02:55 I do not know why but like everything is falling apart. Like I am incapable of spawning a single recent build (advanced motor lock etc) without some form of flinging
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:25:26 Well thatâ€™s where your wrong. the A-4 is quite literally one block wide exactly because of that reason.
creations-chat 2022-05-21 05:24:52 This is actually wrong. A block = 2.5 feet.
creations-chat 2022-05-22 07:34:57 ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-08-10 16:25:09 Donâ€™t forget the J3a fitted with a PT-2 tender.
creations-chat 2022-08-16 01:02:36 He is right however, his buildâ€™s proportions are a bit janky which throws it off.
general 2022-08-30 01:34:08 Imagine being hand
general 2022-08-30 01:35:19 Quite indeed
general 2022-08-30 01:36:01 Launch?
general 2022-08-30 01:36:42 ok but what launch?
general 2022-08-30 01:36:56 oh that thing
general 2022-08-30 01:37:14 Trolling you
general 2022-08-30 01:37:59 anyways we shall continue with our own matters, have a great night.
general 2022-08-30 01:40:38 Alright I apologize for the inconvenience that resulted from us trolling our former annoying friend, have a great night we will be continuing with our own matters as before.
general 2022-08-30 01:43:04 I once again apologize for the inconvenience caused by my friends and myself for attempting to troll our former and quite frankly annoying friend. Have a great night (again) and hopefully my friends here will shut up and allow us to continue with our own matters.
general 2022-08-30 01:44:28 No I am not. However I have met him and Iâ€™m friends with his friend.
general 2022-08-30 01:48:37 Iâ€™m no longer associating myself with <@!705452854382559263>
general 2022-08-30 01:57:06 I once again apologize for my idiotic friend <@!705452854382559263>â€™s behavior.
creations-chat 2022-09-08 20:38:46 
creations-chat 2022-09-09 21:54:15 <@945822507787751448> First off, where is the roof blister and Secondly, Southern Pacific never operated the RDC-4 and only operated the RDC-1 from what Iâ€™m aware possibly the RDC-2.
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:18:25 I do agree with this, Iâ€™ve seen two in person and they certainly arenâ€™t 3x3
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:37:28 Well 1x1 is more accurate for a V-1 then 3x3
