general 2020-08-27 00:31:22 ive been wondering, how could i talk in <#617941134605549579>?
general 2020-08-27 00:34:54 im trying to make a rocket that can be reusable, but i used rocket engines to turn it, is there any other way for me to make it turn?
general 2020-08-27 00:35:35 wait, rockets can use wings now?
general 2020-08-27 00:35:57 well yes
general 2020-08-27 00:38:01 i used delta wings instead of control surfaces
general 2020-08-27 00:38:04 on my missile
general 2020-08-27 00:38:19 would it make a difference
general 2020-08-27 00:39:04 yeah i think that would work
general 2020-08-27 00:40:45 sukrito
general 2020-08-27 00:40:58 that sounds like a name of a anime character
general 2020-08-27 00:43:55 <@!289930922655088640> it only spins around, it doesnt turn it to a 25 degree angle

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:33:18 oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:33:19 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:33:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:33:53 for the feedback?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:35:11 it's basically a laser in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:35:26 but yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:35:29 it looks kinda bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:31:55 i tried to use a camera to do aiming but now i can’t move the turret up and down, any idea why
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:33:12 oh is there any way i can stop that from happening
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:34:33 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:34:37 ig
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 17:34:37 on the side it
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:10:49 i wish there was a way to do lock on planes or something then it’d easy be able to destroy shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:12:43 well now i really wish there was a way to do a lock on turret
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:13:06 but the closest we fan do is mouse tracking
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:13:15 you just need to be accurate as hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:37:37 just made a giant cannon powered by cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:37:43 i can now destroy fighters
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:38:31 especially these
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:47:23 this guy makes me want to make a pile of cutters and literally explode it all at once
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:49:20 usually i keep using this
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:49:32 what can i use then
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:49:34 it works pretty well for me
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:49:42 well what do i use then
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:50:12 they are uncontrollable
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:51:07 this literally does the job of a shredder but without flying
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:54:29 are you a fucking shredder user
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:54:59 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:55:48 shredders are really annoying
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:56:26 they ruin the fun for others when targetted
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:56:29 and that's what i don't really llike
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:56:50 that's what i really hate with shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:58:43 only reason i use this is because of this
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:59:19 i use whatever the fuck that is
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 01:59:26 i only use it because it's quick and it destroys
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:00:07 this guy really
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:00:55 hm should i just make a barrier of tnt on front of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:01:29 i want to make a tank actually
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:01:32 or a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:06:39 but this moveable rocket launcher is so op
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:06:41 it does so much damage
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:07:04 shredders just fly and spin with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:08:05 i don't fucking care about your shredder
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:11:43 the cons of this thing is that you can't fire too high up
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:11:53 the pros is that it is super accurate and quick
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:12:00 it also has guns mounted just in case
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:13:18 unless you do this
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:14:04 then you can aim high up
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:14:59 still better than a one shot shredder tbh
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:15:44 eh i prefer using planes to strike
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:28:27 just made a horrible bouncing bomb
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:28:45 and it
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:28:47 works..
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 02:28:59 i will attack this to my bomber

plane-crazy 2022-05-14 22:59:22 also <@695336889997066251> can it happen because of like, small wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 22:59:56 oh that's probably why
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 23:01:36 oh yeah, i also don't have the back wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 23:01:40 just the main wing
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 23:05:12 it's absolutely awesome, if you can fit something like, a spitfire or a small bomber: that's perfect
