plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:48:13 Can we all agree on one thing, we NEED proper torpedos (ones that can be fired from submarines/boats and ones that can be dropped by bombers)
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:49:20 So we dont have to make torpedos that dont work half the time
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:53:41 Nono its literally just when i drop torpedos when they hit the target they dont explode, or go crazy, or explode when they touch water, or just doesnâ€™t go anywhere
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:55:34 Also having a proper torpedo means you can have a submarine with torpedos that like to work and not take up to much space
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:55:59 Also torpedo bombers
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:56:16 But the detachment method is always clunky
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:57:06 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:57:39 But then theres the issue of the torpedo having a seizure and not going in a straight line
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 21:58:35 And if you drop them from a plane it just either explodes or hates life and wont cooperate
