plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:24:34 I need to rant for no reason to level up so I can post builds and whatnot because I need levels. Poptarts are better toasted when your happy but if your tired they don't hit good. Motorlock can be confusing but honestly it's pretty good. Dogs are better than cats because cats eat shit.

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:34:27 this article is about some of the longest English words on record. No, you will not find the very longest word in English in this article. That one word would span about fifty-seven pages. It‚Äôs the chemical name for the titin protein found in humans. Its full name has 189,819 letters. Would you like to hear it pronounced? One man helpfully sounds it out in a YouTube video, but pop some popcorn before you get started! It will take you over three hours to watch‚Äîit‚Äôs just slightly shorter than the film Gone with the Wind. Dictionaries omit the name of this protein and many other long words. Obviously, dictionaries have space constraints, and the average person would have no need to know the technical names of chemicals. Still, there are plenty of lengthy words in dictionaries. Let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate a few of them.

When it comes to the perfect apple pie there are 2 questions you need to ask. What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust.

BEST APPLES FOR PIE
There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store!

Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush.
Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process.
Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety.
Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others.
Jonagold - A little tart and sweet.
Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart
