plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:51:09 anyone
help 2020-05-09 18:08:29 can somebody with a hovercraft or helicopter that can hover help me test my net
help 2020-05-13 00:01:16 anyone know the best way to mobilize my net(like, hovercraft? Drone? Heli? etc.)? Or perhaps a better way to make the net than anchored blocks and rope
help 2020-05-13 00:02:15 ive tried normal blocks and although they work well, it functions the same as unanchored anchor blocks, and i'd rather use the anchor blocks because having that many blocks attached by rope is p laggy when it moves, so i'd like to be able to lock it.
help 2020-05-13 00:08:42 so like springs
help 2020-05-13 00:08:49 they dont bend, der
help 2020-05-13 00:10:00 ok
help 2020-05-13 00:20:57 im probably gonna put 8 or so rope cords to the edges, put disconnectors there
help 2020-05-13 00:21:20 1 on each corner, 1 a few in in the same corner direction
help 2020-05-13 00:21:30 now i just gotta figure out how to make a good drone
