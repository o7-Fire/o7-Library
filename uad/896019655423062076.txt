but with audio and copyright
general 2023-04-07 21:22:57 true
general 2023-04-07 21:23:05 you can only do so much with motorlock
general 2023-04-07 21:23:57 sometimes i think about booting up good old plane crazy to make an f-35 or something but then i remember the pain of 30 gigashits of motorlocking ill have to do to make a decent shape
general 2023-04-07 21:25:55 wdym offset
general 2023-04-07 21:26:28 i guess
general 2023-04-07 21:29:37 back when i didnt have a job that started at 6 am in the morning i had patience and concentration to build the most overcomplicated motorlock shit, 
now i just wanna build casually and have to not use my brain TOO much. thats why more shapes would be nicer
general 2023-04-07 21:30:51 havent checked this server in a long time but it seems the mods still dont do their job
