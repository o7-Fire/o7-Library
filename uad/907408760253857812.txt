plane-crazy 2022-11-26 05:40:55 Whys bro calling the bot
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 05:42:45 Its the ramiel i made
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 05:43:51 It screams funny
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 05:51:04 IM STILL STANDIN
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 05:52:06 barrel plane is invincible
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:13:59 Was in a pvp server and this dudes jet as untouchable did crazy 180s, a shredder hit his wing clean off and he flew fine as if it never happened.  to summarize, bro said his jet uses "core tech" and"void tech" and he said info on how it works is "classified"🤓

So my question, does this void tech or core tech even exist?
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:19:47 Yeah my fav thing in this game is when someones hyper realistic jet does unrealistic things like a 1 inch 180 turn 

And then they claim its skill
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:20:56 Speed and doing constant 180s isnt a skill, its lazy and just ruins the fun of doing jet fights because it just turns into a loop fight
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:21:22 Cobra maneuvers are cool, but thats it
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:21:31 No need to do 20 cobras
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:22:48 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:23:29 The constant 1 second 180 spam is what this guy did
creations-chat 2022-11-26 18:24:17 Made a saab21r
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:31:38 He claimed the core tech made his jet more stable
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:32:43 Not at all, most pvp jets that do 180s in 1 second typically use a conveyor boost or simply keep behind you
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:33:13 Hitting that small window would also require i do a 180 in a second, but im not lowering myself to that level
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:34:27 My saab21r build flys as realistically as the real thing, so to do a full 180 it takes around 3 seconds, by that time they will have still be behind me
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:34:42 My saab21r is my best pvp jet i currently have
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:36:16 In the image he had this funny lil gyro thing involving ballast blocks, anchor blocks, motors and hover engines, which he spun up before flying, it would detach and then remain where he spawned as he flew away
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:36:43 Because its more fun then doing non stop 180s every sevond and spamming rockets
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:39:02 The only difference it made was if he lost his wings he could still fly and it apparently "made it way more stable" acvording to him
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:39:45 Yeah thats not my jet btw, thats his "core/void tech" jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:40:15 I did, it didnt do anything to him
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:40:42 He said and i quote"even if you destroy it, the effects remain on the jet itself"
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:41:25 "Shoot his plane" the plane in question
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:43:38 I dont have any nonrealistic flying planes
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:48:03 He left the server so we dont find out his "secrets"
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:50:06 "Rational obelus"
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:51:16 I hate this conquerers 3 game, territory based game and these sweaty mfers own the entire map in like the 1st minute
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:51:45 As if i could hit him
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:51:52 He kept doing 180s
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:53:08 I told yall
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:55:33 My non core tech barrel plane flew better without a wing
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:56:03 I will add it later
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 18:56:42 Ye i sent it there
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 19:01:02 Im making this and hopefully it will be my new better pvp jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 19:01:19 Possible thrust vectoring maybe too
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 19:02:10 What?
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 19:03:27 I dont get wha your doing

creations-chat 2022-12-12 11:14:30 You spoke about void tech earlier, know someone by the name of RationalObelus?

Im confused cause i asked him in dms to show me the core/void tech on and off and the only notable difference was he couldnt do instant 180s.

Tbh it seems useless if thats all it actually does and seems to ruin the fun of a pvp dogfight if no one can actually tail you

Heres the sevond clip with his core/void tech on

Bro also said its all classified in a group when the only difference is he can do instant 180s while its on<@834898687959367751>
creations-chat 2022-12-12 11:23:08 As i said the only notable difference was he could do a instant 180 with it on which ruins the fun of pvp dogfight if no one can tail you
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 11:26:07 Tbh, pvp dogfights are only fun if you can be tailed, its very unfun if all you do is instant 180s
creations-chat 2022-12-12 11:43:05 Very true, my 200 speed biplane was being chased by 3 super/hyper  maneuverable jets and it took them 15 minutes to hit me 1 time because they couldnt aim
creations-chat 2022-12-12 12:45:23 Yes because he made the mistake of sending me videos of his "classified" "core/void tech" and i dont keep secrets because i love drama
creations-chat 2022-12-12 12:49:04 Its all just stupid tbh, why go through all that just so you can do instant 180s and still miss
creations-chat 2022-12-12 13:10:24 Yeah i know
creations-chat 2022-12-12 13:13:40 Thats his "coretech core" in the 2 videos i sent earlier he shows one flight without the core and one with it

The only difference was with it off he was slower and couldnt do instant 180 turns

With it on he was faster wobbly and could do lame instant 180s
creations-chat 2022-12-12 13:17:09 Yes very fun to pvp(this is a lie and i hate unfun pvp fights, like im flying in a large turn radius and this guy is doing cobras nonstop missing all his shots and doing instant 180s  still missing his shots yet i cant get a tail on him because hes got a glitch engine and flys away

creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:37:01 Ah, so your also an unfun jet user and maker just like rationalobelus? <@834898687959367751> 

And<@456226577798135808>  its not my jet, its sum tryhard unfun dudes jet
creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:41:27 Shredders? You immedietly lost any value you hold in my eyes

Also using them in huge space ships is fine as those are relatively hard to control, but im talking about your friend RationalObelus who used it on a pvp jet so he basicly becomes untouchable

He flys away at lightspeed if i get a nose on him and if i cant get nose on him he jusy does instant 180s while i try to lose him

Tldr, i met a plane crazy tryhard
creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:52:04 Imo i hate super maneuverable jets if they claim super maneuveribility is 180s nonstop they are just annoying in general

The fun of a dogfight is the chase, not the carnival show of backflips
creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:59:28 My namnam saab jas 39  gripen doesnt use any props and doesnt do constant 180s, its very stable and keeps a decent max speed of like 670

When i do a sharp turn it slows down and kinda stalls but it isnt instantaneous.

Thats imo maneuveribility

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:44:31 Any tips?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:44:48 At the front?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:45:12 Its a prop plane not a jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:46:12 The plane in question
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:46:27 Its a bit overlocked
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:46:34 Where do i add canards
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:48:19 Like push them forward?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:48:41 Alr ican try
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:05:17 Added motor 2 wheels mixed with canards
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:06:03 It still dives
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:06:35 A bit overlocked
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:08:12 Still konda dives, landing gear canards have to be aimed up nonstop

Doesnt dive much anymore
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:37:08 My most anglelocked build so far, swept wings, angled cockpit, and a rounder engine area
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 17:41:11 Wings and canards ar a bit ugly but it flys almost as agile as a race plane

general 2022-12-15 16:27:32 Alr wait, hold up, hear me out

Why dont they make a tank that every lays down flat in it, the turret is stiff locked to the center and only aims up n down by like 12 degrees.

Like the funny wedge tank.

That way less areas to hit

I dont really understand it all because i like staying sane
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 18:09:33 The rooms im making on my oil rig base
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:02:53 I have been trying to make this vtol work for the past hour

I dont know what the issue is, everything else works fine

BUT THE VTOL ENGINES WOBBLE IF THEY ARENT LOCKED, AND IF I LOCK THEM THEY GO OUT OF SYNC AND MESS UP TURNING AND VTOL
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:03:17 I DONT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:03:49 I have tryed servo motors, max torque, locked motor 1s unlocked motor 1s, toggle, reset, locked, powered
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:08:30 WHY DOES TH MOTOR BREAK I DONT UNDERSTAND
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:21:55 I give up on it
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:22:06 I cant figure out any solution to it
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:22:12 The motor keeps breaking
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:51:57 Fr
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:53:27 Doesnt matter now, i give up on making vtols altogether
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:54:51 The main issue was the motors would break if they were locked, but if i unlocked them, they would wobble uncontrollably, so i tried srvos and motor 2s, those also wobbled
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 20:56:09 Yeah i gave up and began working on my oil rig base, already at 4k blocks lol

plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:50:02 Paint blocks will generate imense lag if they get destroyed
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:53:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:56:01 Source? My mank is 90%paint blocks and above 5k blocks so whenever someone destroys a paint block it becomes 6 different pieces.

Rn each paint block is 7 parts, 6 sides and a core

Mank is 5k blocks
7x5000
Around 35000 parts💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:56:24 So yes, paint blocks create lag when destroyed
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:56:55 Its possible with piston or magnet locking

So if i move the chair the cameras get moved , the only solution is to add ugly angle locks or have the chair not centered

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 12:59:36 I got ten hours to learn basic angle locking and make a yak 1000
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:01:25 Without yalls suggestions i was prolly gonna make the mig 41💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:02:28 Yea gimme more because im lazy and to make the tube i woulda used hollow jet engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:03:20 I might still do the mig 41 tho because it looks very complex
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:04:01 Looks unstable, cant wait to flat spin
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:04:21 Gimme more
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:04:36 Wtf

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:19:21 For my plane the gears will be half blick wide and actually fold into wings without having bulky wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:20:05 Doing good, started earlier making the V 536 , got the intakes nearly done
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:25:12 I showed this dude how my missle was better so he just acts like it doesnt exist right beside him
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:26:10 Bro thinks his misse has a world record
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:30:12 Bro thinks his missle has a record and then makes excuses on why hecant fly it

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:51:59 The gear works, hidden but theres a very tiny slight gap
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:52:14 The small gap can be fixed easily

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 19:21:24 Gotta lower the whole cockpit and landing gear assembly by half block, other then that, doing well
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 19:22:17 I will try to make the intake front underside point up like pictured but it may be ugly if i do so ill prolly just leave it
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 19:31:30 I also have to sjorten the landing gear now
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 19:32:00 Here

creations-chat 2023-01-15 11:41:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 11:42:42 Its simple, extend piston with lock toggled, wait a few seconds for it to lock, then collapse the motorlock towr
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 11:44:07 Does it have to be text? I woulda used half block wedge 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 12:02:45 Internets out rn, ill start my last 3 hours of the 10 hour build when the  inteenet returns

creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:11:43 Idc, im stupid and shit, and did the best i could in 10 hours
"10 hours is alot of time" and i spent most of it thinking and overcomplicating stuff so yeah, theres prolly some wrong bits, but for my first time doing a 10 hour build and my first time doing a hefty motorlocked jet, i did pretty good
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:18:17 Your a very negative person, look on the bright side, no xposed locks
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:20:54 Thank you kanye very cool
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:23:11 Thank you kanye very cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 19:24:42 You dont need clearance for text. You ca prolly close tge gap a bit more
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 19:27:05 Mk

plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:26:51 ?
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:31:49 Hmm, best you can do to grab a build is make a smal rope net with anchors, once it collodes with the build, anchor it and hopeits wraped around it
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:33:02 How to capture a build

Step 1: make a flyable plot sized rope net covered in anchrs

Step 2:profit

plane-crazy 2023-03-01 08:01:08 Idea, instead of having the gears stiff, maybe have them fold up as canards
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 08:02:56 Maybe have it be a slower plane tho because its small and compact wing area
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 08:03:20 If its fast it may be uncontrollably agile

plane-crazy 2023-03-10 03:03:19 Camera guided missles with m2 as the controls is a bit hard

plane-crazy 2023-03-10 08:28:19 A 10 irl is actually op.

In game its just *drops bombs at slow speed, misses target, turns around, fires rockets, misses, turns around, fires guns, barely dents target because it fires in straight line, respawns to load bombs again*

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:53:56 "Russian jets are better" waaa waaa waaa
"American jets are better" waaa waaa waaa

Sweden jets>
 they look cooler.

Russian jets just have blue paint and a droopy nose.

American jets just have grey paint and funny freedom.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:55:07 Plus nearly all russian jets look the same, minus the inverted sweep wing one.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:55:38 American jets at least have style points
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:55:47 Sweden jets are goofy and i love them
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:57:02 I can identify any jet as russian simply because nearly all russian jets look the same.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:59:23 "But russian jets have thrust vectoring🤓" cool and irl that doesnt matter when a side winder is after you from a target with a small radar thingy
"In game thrust vectoring matters🤓"

All that and you still only attack large targets while rocket and firework spamming whilst doing instant 180s.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:00:12 Thrust vectoring is cool.yes. but. AIM 9 disagrees.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:00:27 Fr
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:01:45 "My realistic jet is better then your plane and i have more skill" *does unrealistic instant 20g 180 flip and rocket spams. Still misses*

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:21:53 Whats goin on?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:22:18 Was there a update that broke m2
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:22:31 Wild.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:11 So. Instead of fixing how mptor 2s randomly break. He just made them permanently break
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:43 Oh what
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:56 Man
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:24:21 Guess ill have to make cheese grater planes now
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:11 Also rip custom steering systems that use m2.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:58 OOOOO. MEANS SHREDDER BUGS ARE DEAD NOW AND SO ARE M2 TNT CANNONS OR MISSLE SPAMMERS. WOOO
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:35 Tf is a nam tntn cannon
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:58 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:11 That doesnt help
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:33 I thought namnam just made 1 wide trapdoor pvp tryhard planes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:28:04 Fr and ima laugh
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:28:17 Down with the tryhards woop woop
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:28:43 Motor 2 tanks will also fail now unless they slow the m2 down
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:28:47 Yay
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:01 Now weapon spamming speed tanks have to slow down
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:40 It kills pvp tryhards like namnam jets and stuff that do instant 180s.
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:55 Fr
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:30:07 I see this as absolute win
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:30:30 Ew a namnam watcher
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:30:51 It is good.

And were like

"It breaks shredder bugs and kinda stops pvp tryhards. This is an absoluet win"
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:23 So every namnam jet ever?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:35:10 Slim can stay mad. Im mostly glad shredder bugs break now
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:37:22 "Technique" *slap tons of propellers in nose and wings, adds trapdoors instead of  wing panels, most likely a cringe russian jet, adds all 12 rockets and fireworks*
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:38:36 Yes. In nearly every pvp server ive been in till today i have seen at least 1 cringe namnam copy or jet
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:39:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:39:28 And im all for it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:39:43 Down with the m2 tryhard jets
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:39:54 Down with the shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:55:39 Adapt, improvise, overcome
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:22 Helis arent totally fucked tbh. Some rotoro designs will still work. Just no m2 stuff on it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:37 Flying turrets will break aswelll so yay
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:55 I use the performance blade setup , which is motor 1, coaxial, and the blades are from center to outer=wing panel, propeller blade, and control surface

plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:17:36 Think of dampening as how squishy the suspension is under force. Or how easily it squishes
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:18:19 Stiffness is how rigid it is, like how quickly it returns to its set height
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:18:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:18:35 Wait no
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:18:46 More dampening makes it bounce more
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:19:09 Think ofnit like your legs when you jump
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 03:20:07 When you jump, your oegs go from stiff, extend, then stiff.

By increasing the dampening, you now absorb the shock and go stiff, extend, slow, then stiff.

creations-chat 2023-03-30 07:32:14 People who make russian jets make me laugh, not because the support a country losing to itself, but because , all russian jets look fairly the same. only differences being, how far the nose and cockpit droop down, the wings being swept or reverse sqept, the paint job and ofc "thrust vectoring🤓" 

They are simply outdated and would be destroyed irl easily as they have massive radar signal.

With all this said, some snarky neckbeards will reply to this trying to explain how russian jets are the best and how making copys of namnam's guide jets are skillfull and isnt a mindless tutorial.

plane-crazy 2023-04-27 23:57:08 Is it possible to make a heli that aims the whole heli towards your mouse?
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 23:58:13 I was thinking maybe some control surfaces on the tail rotor, but that doesnt really aim towards the mouse
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 23:58:20 Ima experiment
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 23:59:11 I mainly want the nose to aim at the mouse, without having to use any wasd or key input
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 23:59:23 So something involving m2
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 00:00:47 Maybe ill do m2 tail rotor and try some options, so as it spins it either goes left or right to aim at the mouse
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 02:34:27 Its hard to tell in this but are you turning the heli at all?
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 02:35:02 I mean with wasd
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 02:35:18 I want like 100% mouse aiming, no wasd input
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 02:35:46 I did it using a m2 tail rotor but it was bulky, so how did you do yours?

plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:35:07 thoughts?
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:14 i themed the heli on the swordfish, the turret being teh sword
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:38 The fish swordfish
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:41 Not the biplane
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:37:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:37:30 And the whole heli is mouse guided
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:38:25 I based it on the fish the Swordfish

But took inspiration from this
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:39:15 Yeah i will eventually, but i like it thin since its based on a drone design
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:40:09 Once i feel like spending years of my brainpower, i will make this with as much angle lock as i can
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:40:50 Its fairly agile already, since the entire heli is mouse controled (except the roll and accelleration)
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:44:29 A helpfull hints are

1: all camera lock welds to the main pilot seat, and motorlock cant move cameralock.
2: the red dot on a camera really helps, and if the red dot is at the bottom of the camera, whatevers on it will flip over when aimed, essentially, its best to use camera lock for gears or arms of sorts

3: it takes practice, but eventually, you will learn, anglelock is alot easier to manage then a full camlock build
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:47:56 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:48:36 Sean, pls teach me what has troubled you
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:49:23 I only used the camlock for my gears
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:49:50 Not really
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:50:21 I mainly use cam lock on gears
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:50:43 Idk what a mi28 is
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:52:40 Nah , sean said mi-28
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:53:54 Hows it modified tho

They are entirely different. The tail rotor isnt the same and all thats missing on the nose is the canopy

plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:31:13 Torque is great fpr those common situations where you want to fling something without half piston glitch

Enemy in your way? Hit em with a rotating 1x7 beam at max tprque and send them back to the stone age!!!
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:36:09 Tryna make a super safe base. Ofc it wont be unbreachable since theres no cure all counter to every pvp weapon.

Any recommendations.

So far i have, 1st layer 1x7 beams and anchor blocks for gun protection. 2nd layer spaced armor for firework spam protection and rocket protection. 3rd layer will be Paint blocks as they are decent armor compared to regular blocks. And inner stuff will be tnt protected.
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:36:54 I dont care if its attacked, i just want to have enough time to react to attacks. Or make it such a long process
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:37:29 Really?!
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:37:48 I thought spawn was solid and had collisions

plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:38:36 Are cutters immune to things?
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:38:53 I see
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:40:55 I learned that paint blocks are decent buffer blocks for armor when against a firework spammer.

Fireworks go thru 1 block. A paint block counts as 2 blocks, the paint sides, and the blocks inner core, so the firework explodes early.
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:43:34 Also parachutes are one time use, but are immune to rockets. Usefull for maybe like a anti rocket trophy system, but temporary fix
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:52:43 Lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 12:55:56 <@200793484053970944> whats the best block to use as flares. Functionality included

plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:05:10 Making a plane while sleep deprived.

1st question.
Its gonna be flat and wide, but which direction, do i make it vertically flat or horizontally flat.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:34:39 <@200793484053970944> 

Making a flat round plane, do i make it a flounder or a tire. Both are metaphors for shapes. 
Im asking, flat vertically or flat horizontally.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:35:07 Not rn rick
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:35:48 My creations have been fine overall so i cant exactly say
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:36:31 Aye falded
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:36:37 Flat or tire.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:52:11 Id much rather deal with shredders in pc2.

At least you can outspeed and outmaneuver most shredders. Namnam jets are such a pain.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:55:25 Yeah but if given enough time or a decent pvp block. A youtuber will just pull a vulpen and namnam. Basicly what im saying is if rick adds more pvp and pvp becomes more intense, youtubers will make more tuts, "guides" etc.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:55:43 Thanks to server delay yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:56:25 He can add anything, but just like anything you add more too, the result will also be more.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:58:06 What i really wanna see is viable missles.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:58:57 Yeah^^
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:59:09 You cat exactly fix server delay.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:59:55 Just change the explosion to a default test ball for a bit, tty that on a test server, then add sum effects.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:00:24 My favorite issue rn is the invis bug with guns.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:00:43 I shoot an enemy with guns. And on my end they freeze mid air.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:01:47 Fr
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:01:53 Or its against a namnam jet

creations-chat 2023-07-03 11:03:56 I made my best plane when i was sleep deprived

creations-chat 2023-07-03 22:04:53 All that and the best skill it has is instant 720s.
creations-chat 2023-07-03 22:08:49 I was being satireacal.

About the state of pvp in this game. I could slap a pair of 2 vertical stabilizers, maybe a row of hover engines, some rear m2m wing panels of sorts and quite literally any front wing set up with weapon spam and have a jet that comes close to a namnam jet.
creations-chat 2023-07-03 22:11:31 My favorite thing to make is fairly horrible and tanky stuff, like a biplane bomber, but replace the props with super rockets.

Or a nuke truck, but give it 16 wheels and replace the nuke with a giant flare. Etc.

I like doing builds while sleep deprived, less sleep=less thinking=less crazy stuff=more fun= it works.
creations-chat 2023-07-03 22:14:34 I already made the biplane, i gave it 2 heavy cluster bombs a few turrets a spongebob music audio and its longest flight time in pvp while under constant attack from namnam jets was like 13 minutes.

Working on the nuclear flare gun rn, but ima go to bed so.
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 10:27:56 In your opinion, what block causes the most lag when someone loads it in.
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 10:28:25 I say cameras.

I saw a dude who had a whole plot of cameras, and server took forever to respond.
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 10:35:01 <@584060481522761728> yo, as im a noob with no knowledge of missle trucks, is it best to limit the base turret horizontal rotation? Or make it able to spin 360.
, 

Im making a crap nuke truck, thats not just gonna have tnt on it. But like, every possible annoying block ever on it.
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 10:37:56 Oh alr

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 01:18:42 Tbh i have a harder time fighting helis and vtols then jets.

Most jets just fly away at lightspeed with stacked hover engines or do constant instant 180s which isnt fun at all and is boring.

But fighting helis often involves strafing and actual dodging

plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:27:52 time for my 2 braincells to hit eachother like the hadron collider
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:28:56 no, uses servo m2  which push unpowered motors up and the suspension helps align it so the whole thing isnt offset
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:10 just like a real swashplate
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:41 swashplates have lil bars/arms/pistons that extend upwards to lift 1 side of a blade
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:47 lemme grab an image

plane-crazy 2023-07-11 18:04:50 Just gotta pilot against it
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 18:18:31 You do that with a working compact swashplate in a 3x3 space
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 18:19:29 My heli flys fine with its compact swashplate, and it cant get anymore compact
