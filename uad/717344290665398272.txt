general 2021-05-14 04:34:28 hallo
general 2021-05-14 04:35:57 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:37:42 Welp
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:37:48 I need help with something
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:38:25 I putted a Motor at the center of my vehicle so that the body would turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:38:30 instead its the upper part turning
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:39:04 is there any way to fix it?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:39:41 but what if I make the upper part more heavy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:39:47 would it make the body be the one turning?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:39:52 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:40:07 yeah the torque is on maximum
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:40:39 wait how do you get image perms?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:40:54 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:41:30 because I needed the body to turn so the whole vehicle can turn left and right
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:41:42 the default steering of wheels is too low
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 04:42:09 and using the Motor Wheel would consume too much space it would get my design out of shape
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 04:35:38 welp
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 04:35:55 I guess there is no type of wedge yet to cover some piece of block in my creation

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 04:41:42 Triangle wedge block
