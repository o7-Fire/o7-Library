plane-crazy 2022-04-09 08:30:46 ok quick question
how much of a pain is it to make something with huge jet engines fly
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 08:40:30 I'm trying to "for science" stuff ok
I want to just see if the huge jet engines are even usable in any form on an aircraft without the enormous weight of the engine itself being the demise of the airframe
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 08:56:43 was already planning on it
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:19:48 ok it manages to fly
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:19:59 but it flies like a brick
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:24:10 I mean there's probably excess drag from the giant wingspan I have just to make sure the 6 engines don't stall it easily
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:32:37 I meant the weight increasing the stall speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:33:26 I could try cutting down the wings
but I don't know if it would fly any better
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:34:40 ok definitely flies better
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 09:35:40 skill issue moment
general 2022-04-09 18:25:41 Wth
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 21:51:57 hm
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 21:52:19 better than most of my builds tbh
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 22:39:59 chaos
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:43:18 ^
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:44:25 That's just Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:47:51 Same here
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:52:54 pls send
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 19:07:34 ok after playing it
that's just a different game on it's own
that's not really going to be any real problem to Plane Crazy 2
or the og Plane Crazy for that matter
if it was, that would be *Plane Crazy*

general 2022-04-10 22:29:44 jesus what is that motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 23:52:20 what did I come back to
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 00:22:57 wdym rgb is good for gaming

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:17:56 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:18:14 nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:20:21 I have a jet that can do that but I never talk about it because I mostly based it off a tutorial with minor modifications (very creative, I know). <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:21:15 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:26:05 I built a "super-maneuverability" PvP aircraft that is uh a bit much in the way of nonsense
Can U-turn at 1800 speed in a fraction of a second but bleeds nearly all of the speed at the same time
At least I put in a powerful hover engine assembly on it
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 13:26:21 Oh I can post images now
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:29:33 PSM bullshittery üóø 
It's controllable but going any faster than 2100 speed causes uncontrollable yaw wobble
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:31:01 Very controllable at or below 1800
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:31:07 It's lightweight
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:32:13 ooh
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:32:46 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:32:51 Mostly
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:33:00 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:34:05 I have it so I can disable m2m control on demand but have yet to implement full keyboard control
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:34:24 It stabilizes without m2m at high speeds
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:38:55 Probably, it already works with the flight control propellers at high speeds but not well
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:46:19 I haven't thought of a way to do that... ü§î 
Do you mean without any flight control systems or with a different one?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:49:45 For the former the only way I can think of doing that is with servo mode motor2 canards with a high deflection angle controlled via keyboard
Latter would probably employ a super rocket engine or another form of propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:50:51 Mainly roblox physics <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:56:33 Thanks for explaining that you need to make thrustercraft to have PSM without wing panels <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:01:54 Wing panels generating a lot of active lift with having very low velocity is kind of the issue
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:02:28 Glider wings essentially, kinda prevents AoA from existing
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:09:46 How much "AoA" does anyone here think can be achieved with wing panel aircraft
general 2022-04-12 15:13:06 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:14:08 Angle of Attack
Or assuming from that answer it simply doesn't exist in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:14:31 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:16:46 Specifically aircraft made with wing panels for lift without any additional flight control via propulsion for stuff like that is what I meant
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:17:55 Hmmm...
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:19:24 ok I'll attempt the modification later
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:25:33 ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:25:59 I see
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:27:05 sir
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:29:05 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:34:34 I never said it with the implication of being difficult to do
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:34:44 At least not intentionally
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:35:20 I tuned it so it doesn't overshoot
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:35:41 It has overshooting issues at higher speeds from wobble though :(
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:39:23 No reverse engines
I can flip it the other way via propellers because it is so light but that is it
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:41:15 I haven't tried it, but probably yes
But I should try that first
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:43:14 Not really sure about that
I *can* force it to yaw strongly but not at high speeds
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:43:58 What would be equivalent of that in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:44:23 It gets close but falls short by 500 speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:45:02 If I had a larger engine sure but I kept it small
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:46:06 so a flyable ICBM
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:47:23 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:49:13 How do you get no wobble though
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:49:32 ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:49:49 Good enough
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 15:54:35 Mfw drifting is hard to do unless you set your aircraft up for it
Oh well, doesn't hurt to try

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:42:09 That just made me laugh and idk why
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:44:06 Wouldn't you use those on craft that actually have actuating launch rails on their IRL counterpart
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:44:18 And not uh a Mig-21

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:48:17 Why
More importantly, wtf are you doing referencing ac3
I get that's supposed to be the Su-37 but <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:50:03 My best own builds for planes are literally a stick with bells and whistles on them
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:50:36 Because I can't build otherwise without putting too much weight on the aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:51:59 Uh oh
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:52:12 Here comes the knife stab
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:52:29 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:54:07 Ah yes ICBMs
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:54:35 I sense something wrong with that or it otherwise actually looks good
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 16:55:30 o no

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:09:01 I'm gonna have wobble for days unless I reduce engine power
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:10:01 I have no idea because the last time I touched anime was years ago
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:16:08 I wish I couldn't say the same üòî
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:16:44 How does one not build a stick with flight control systems slapped on it
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:18:21 Let me rephrase that
How to not build an *ugly stick with flight control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:18:44 I mean I already learned how somewhat from doing a tutorial build but I lack creativity
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:19:52 I tried that and I had no idea how
So no matter what testbed I tried to use it spun or tilted out of control even with careful tuning of tail rotors
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:20:41 I used propeller blades
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:21:03 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:22:05 but but
That's the lazy way
I want real helicopter
malding rn
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:23:18 What's the extra motors for
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:23:55 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:26:55 Oh one last question
How do you utilize motorlock to have blocks rotated at a 45-135¬∞ angle
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:27:22 Or is that cam lock
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:27:29 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:28:16 Oh that's why I see monster motorlock towers at times
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:28:27 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:29:28 I saw that someone had once over locked their build with what looked like 150+ super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:29:36 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:29:50 I didn't even want to imagine the drag
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:31:08 I used it then realized the airframes I build are too prone to wobble to max out those
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:33:19 It's called "motor 2 mouse"
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:33:49 How so
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:34:30 ^
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:36:22 I consider usage of that on an aircraft laziness
Unless you're actually stuck
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:37:56 They often have so much weight that it causes issues with motor mouse controls
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 17:50:04 mfw I made a nam Su-27 just so I could get a grip on building PvP airframes
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 18:05:10 If you get hit in the first place by a 6 rocket volley your plane will be screwed up unless it is a lag/block/beam-heavy build
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 18:11:51 They cause drag
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 18:13:14 If your build is that laggy üíÄ

general 2022-04-13 15:52:27 sorry you what
general 2022-04-13 20:15:44 OBS uses that as the default video output format
general 2022-04-13 20:16:22 As sudden power loss or shut downs allows you to resume recording where you left off if you didn't save the recording
general 2022-04-13 20:16:43 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:24:53 <@619312093962829849> ok so remember the non-propeller based psm controls you were talking to me about
I tried the canard idea and it was close to working but fails
also caused vertical wobble (probably thanks to my craft being a literal paperweight)
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:25:38 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:25:39 ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:30:24 ok so turning the whole craft into diamond plate makes the craft too tail heavy gonna try something else
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:34:33 ok so balancing it works but the canards still don't work
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:35:08 as in the craft is heavy enough to start falling at 150-ish speed as opposed to less than 40
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:36:55 I'm too lazy to make a new airframe, I'm just modifying one I already have for the moment
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:37:43 wait what do you mean by AP
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:37:49 sorry if I seem clueless
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:38:24 oh that
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:53:20 <@619312093962829849> ok for reference I'm using an airframe based off of nam's Su-27
which now that I think about it probably wasn't designed with extra weight from material switching in mind ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this is what I get for using a 90%-ish tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 22:54:16 I'll just revisit it when I build a new plane

plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:07:53 I wouldn't motorlock to the point where it is 90% of your build

plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:09:45 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:11:54 Yeah uh
You couldn't have just built most of the fuselage without motorlock? <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:13:07 OK well technically 40% of it isn't motorlocked
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:15:22 That's unconventionally aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:15:29 Not necessarily shit at flying

They haven't found a way to make it commercially viable yet
general 2022-05-26 14:44:37 They're using more energy to start and maintain the reaction than they are gaining energy
