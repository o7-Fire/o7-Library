bug-reports 2018-10-23 00:27:22 Block Beneath The Base
bug-reports 2018-10-23 00:27:23 Don't know if this glitch happens to the rest of you. A block spawns beneath my area whenever I initially use the build tool. Figured it was beneath the base when it constantly erupted into my ship from nowhere.
bug-reports 2018-10-23 00:28:17 As I have mentioned before... it occurs whenever I use the build tool
bug-reports 2018-10-23 00:28:31 Don't know if it is repetitive but it is something to  not.
bug-reports 2018-10-23 00:28:33 note*
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 12:49:40 Good reaction though
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 12:40:07 XpertNub336 did a good job of organizing the layout and dedicating sections for the Cargo Contest. Props to the guy.
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 12:41:28 Only question is: Contest- Submissions are for finalized entries ready for judging I assume?
bug-reports 2018-10-25 00:53:36 A recent Roblox update may have ended up causing physics changes that conflict with the nature of builds prior to said update. Parts that were able to rotate into solid frames or against other parts are now locking and preventing desired angles of movement. How will this affect the tournament should designs be revised or scrapped?

general 2022-04-15 12:19:24 How can I have my video content uploaded in "videos" under "Community"?
general 2022-04-15 12:20:29 Gjsolo only has roughly 8k subs
general 2022-04-15 12:21:29 Any youtubers meeting such standard?
general 2022-04-15 12:21:51 so am I being lied to?
general 2022-04-15 12:23:06 I don't want to be cringe but I do want to represent a specific niche in the Plane Crazy Community
general 2022-04-15 12:24:22 I'm not looking much for achievements. I just want to clear preliminaries or requirements to being posting content from my youtube channel
general 2022-04-15 12:24:55 My channel name is Ospaar
general 2022-04-15 12:25:07 I don't have much for Plane Crazy videos
general 2022-04-15 12:25:27 and I only began involvement in the Discord
general 2022-04-15 12:26:48 I don't make it a career if that's your viewpoint
general 2022-04-15 12:27:48 just a hobby
general 2022-04-15 12:27:59 Is there a reason why you say so, azy?
general 2022-04-15 12:29:44 I'm sorry but it all seems so vague in definitions
general 2022-04-15 12:30:48 I think the community defines the platform
general 2022-04-15 12:32:07 Then isn't it logical that the reform must being within the community by addressing key issues that contribute to its degeneracy?

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:25 Yo
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:48 Hey, Storm. Nice to see you here
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:23 Big shoes to fill lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:31 No offense
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:06:10 Can't say I'd have the same level of commitment and enjoyment in BABFT as I have in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:09:56 Despite my experience with that majority, I don't think I would have gotten to where I'm at if it weren't for them
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:10:05 But that's just a small contribution
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:25:43 UTI wouldn't disagree
general 2022-12-22 10:48:36 Friendly reminder?
