general 2020-12-25 12:55:02 aw man
general 2020-12-25 12:55:16 no one's built a shell ejecting, bolt-action sniper rifle in the game before

general 2020-12-25 12:58:51 merry christmas then
general 2020-12-30 05:25:16 hold on
general 2020-12-30 05:25:27 did someone already make a calculator in the game
general 2020-12-30 05:25:38 hmmm
general 2020-12-30 05:25:42 aight
general 2020-12-30 05:26:01 was supposed to make a 8-bit calculator but nevermind
general 2020-12-30 05:26:23 well i gave it a shot before
general 2020-12-30 05:26:36 until i deleted it for slot space
general 2020-12-30 05:26:53 well ye it's complex if you're talking about the gates
general 2020-12-30 05:27:11 im new
general 2020-12-30 05:27:33 was gonna request a rank but i figured that i wanted to be white for no
general 2020-12-30 05:27:35 *Now
general 2020-12-30 05:27:55 ye
general 2020-12-30 05:28:03 expert sorta ez if you have willpower
general 2020-12-30 05:28:09 i do not.
general 2020-12-30 05:28:44 me
general 2020-12-30 05:28:58 because i tried it
general 2020-12-30 05:29:50 i literally tried making a large rifle with full functions and high detail but i realized that it doesn't even fit by any category
general 2020-12-30 05:30:06 seems like low-quality motion blur on a game
general 2020-12-30 05:30:14 oh
general 2020-12-30 05:30:34 well im halfway through the gun
general 2020-12-30 05:30:41 ok that's actually fine
general 2020-12-30 05:31:21 seems like a biblically accurate angel to me
general 2020-12-30 05:31:29 ye
general 2020-12-30 05:32:17 put me in
general 2020-12-30 05:32:21 lol
general 2020-12-30 05:32:28 ill try finishing all i got
general 2020-12-30 05:32:40 yes you are not a cabinet
general 2020-12-30 05:34:39 did someone already make an automatic bridge builder?
general 2020-12-30 05:36:13 im disappointed
general 2020-12-30 05:36:27 my miku mech can't walk
general 2020-12-30 05:36:34 screw this mech
general 2020-12-30 05:36:57 that doesn't seem abstract
general 2020-12-30 05:37:04 its seems too specific
general 2020-12-30 05:37:07 about something
general 2020-12-30 05:37:12 idk but it feels specific
general 2020-12-30 05:37:42 seems specific
general 2020-12-30 05:37:51 you're basically telling a story at this point
general 2020-12-30 05:38:02 it makes sense
general 2020-12-30 05:38:29 more like on two contexts, either something looking at something or something looking at a piece of light at something
general 2020-12-30 05:38:55 seems like a shelf with RGB books and some flint and steel with a red aura
general 2020-12-30 05:39:16 ok
general 2020-12-30 05:40:43 just give me the painting

general 2020-12-30 05:45:36 sure

general 2020-12-30 05:46:22 k

general 2020-12-30 07:27:14 hold on
general 2020-12-30 07:27:40 does anyone have a clue on how to make wing panel-based tankk tracks?
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 07:32:51 yo

plane-crazy 2020-12-30 07:33:31 and see that tank has wing panel tank tracks
general 2020-12-30 14:58:10 hmmmmm
general 2020-12-30 14:58:29 dont ask for those blocks, JUST ASK FOR A BLOCK CREATOR
general 2020-12-30 14:58:50 why tho
general 2020-12-30 14:59:04 ikr
general 2020-12-30 14:59:54 im trying to build a colonial star ship but motor lock is too gay to compress the "earth ring" or some crap
general 2020-12-30 14:59:59 i got cracked
general 2020-12-30 15:00:03 i dont like it
general 2020-12-30 15:00:12 yes
general 2020-12-30 15:00:24 motor lock is gayer than the gayest gay in the world
general 2020-12-30 15:00:48 well you found out the very way to outsmart me
general 2020-12-30 15:01:09 kerbal space program
general 2020-12-30 15:01:16 how do you not know such masterpiece
general 2020-12-30 15:01:53 does this mean that sometime in the future a mars colony gets visited by a covid patient (without the pandemic) and just dies on spot
general 2020-12-30 15:02:07 aw man
general 2020-12-30 15:02:10 my standards too low
general 2020-12-30 15:02:35 so low in fact, that I base my progress on building on a roblox game
general 2020-12-30 15:02:47 ksp cracked
general 2020-12-30 15:02:51 ksp ripoffs
general 2020-12-30 15:02:53 done
general 2020-12-30 15:04:03 if only plane crazy added full game editing (like the atmospheric pressure, conditions, land density, etc.) then the game would be saved
general 2020-12-30 15:04:28 the game is dying
general 2020-12-30 15:04:32 only a little
general 2020-12-30 15:04:38 as much as someone suffering from a cold
general 2020-12-30 15:04:43 basically the same thing
general 2020-12-30 15:04:49 ye
general 2020-12-30 15:04:52 thats the point
general 2020-12-30 15:04:59 the OG's sometimes get bored
general 2020-12-30 15:05:01 yte
general 2020-12-30 15:05:19 literally why i said it's like a suffering from a cold
general 2020-12-30 15:06:18 pls dont
general 2020-12-30 15:06:26 he might get greedy
general 2020-12-30 15:06:31 like all the other devs
general 2020-12-30 15:06:36 well, some of them
general 2020-12-30 15:06:42 *looks at EA*
general 2020-12-30 15:07:07 well idk persuade him to "persevere" i guess
general 2020-12-30 15:07:55 so basically we need to not only make him work harder, we need to pay him with donations, and take care of his mental health to not make him fall unto corporate greed
general 2020-12-30 15:08:00 well
general 2020-12-30 15:08:16 good idea
general 2020-12-30 15:08:35 well
general 2020-12-30 15:08:38 a soul for a soul
general 2020-12-30 15:09:19 or maybe even a significantly large space to try out those spacecraft that travel at sub 300,000 SPS
general 2020-12-30 15:09:49 sp
general 2020-12-30 15:09:57 rick needs to add space for spacecraft
general 2020-12-30 15:10:17 space for spacecraft = mini star wars
general 2020-12-30 15:10:27 guess what, it might even be part of 2 large updates
general 2020-12-30 15:10:31 *possibly
general 2020-12-30 15:10:48 i agree
general 2020-12-30 15:11:05 maybe even a 10,000 by 10,000 stud space as an ocean
general 2020-12-30 15:11:19 or
general 2020-12-30 15:11:20 well
general 2020-12-30 15:11:24 the airport is fine
general 2020-12-30 15:11:28 so no changes suggested
general 2020-12-30 15:11:36 still tho
general 2020-12-30 15:11:44 hmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:11:47 yeah
general 2020-12-30 15:11:50 i agree with that
general 2020-12-30 15:12:02 the building space needs a lot of renovations
general 2020-12-30 15:12:11 hmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:12:21 collapsible buildings huh?
general 2020-12-30 15:12:28 i'd say that's genius
general 2020-12-30 15:13:09 yes
general 2020-12-30 15:13:42 in other words, it's extremely practical for him to build a map-sized space for each vehicle category
general 2020-12-30 15:14:06 that will take a long time and that destroys his physical health, if possible
general 2020-12-30 15:14:11 jesus why so many factors
general 2020-12-30 15:14:14 hmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:14:18 maybe bribe him?
general 2020-12-30 15:14:30 well we want the peak higher
general 2020-12-30 15:14:53 if it is at its peak, that's bad, iz gonna die in some time and we can;t let that happen
general 2020-12-30 15:15:15 but it will die too early
general 2020-12-30 15:15:51 of course it;s gonna die, but hell if i;d let that game die after a short lifespan
general 2020-12-30 15:16:10 10 years is fine i guess
general 2020-12-30 15:16:16 but i'd doubt that the game would reach that
general 2020-12-30 15:16:20 unless
general 2020-12-30 15:16:30 hmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:16:36 4 years of development left
general 2020-12-30 15:16:43 and it could be a higher peak
general 2020-12-30 15:16:46 hmmmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:16:55 i guess it wont die until some 12 years i suppose
general 2020-12-30 15:17:00 well
general 2020-12-30 15:17:04 it's sorted then
general 2020-12-30 15:17:26 ye
general 2020-12-30 15:17:33 well
general 2020-12-30 15:17:41 2013 and 2019 was minecraft's peak
general 2020-12-30 15:17:51 and games mostly only ever get 2 peaks
general 2020-12-30 15:18:34 this is the same energy as saying "what's a happy ending?" to a fanbase
general 2020-12-30 15:18:47 well advertising what do you expect
general 2020-12-30 15:19:13 i only ever learned bout minecraf due to some now-cringey youtubers
general 2020-12-30 15:19:37 pewdiepie almost quit and dream's got some problems
general 2020-12-30 15:19:39 well
general 2020-12-30 15:19:43 pray for the game
general 2020-12-30 15:19:54 hell
general 2020-12-30 15:20:12 cheating in a speedrun
general 2020-12-30 15:20:15 what else
general 2020-12-30 15:20:24 idk some seeds i guess
general 2020-12-30 15:20:33 like, control the map, learn it, based off that one seed
general 2020-12-30 15:20:48 ye
general 2020-12-30 15:21:04 well duh
general 2020-12-30 15:21:39 i don't doubt the other vids 100% but i doubt about that specific speedrun's authenticity.
general 2020-12-30 15:21:47 exactly
general 2020-12-30 15:22:14 so lesson learned:

do not spend your skills points on one thing
general 2020-12-30 15:22:52 spawn
general 2020-12-30 15:23:02 literally spawn
general 2020-12-30 15:23:08 "spawning trades"
general 2020-12-30 15:23:10 lmao
general 2020-12-30 15:23:16 wrong terminology, sorry
general 2020-12-30 15:23:55 XD
general 2020-12-30 15:24:38 hmmmm
general 2020-12-30 15:24:46 should i continue building a miku mech
general 2020-12-30 15:25:00 that's obvious
general 2020-12-31 02:25:53 why
general 2020-12-31 02:25:59 oh
general 2020-12-31 02:26:03 but why
general 2020-12-31 02:26:12 naw
general 2020-12-31 02:26:30 even building a calculator wont get you the rank. it's locked now
general 2020-12-31 02:26:49 i was worthy, but the rank locking screwed me over
general 2020-12-31 02:27:12 until someone makes an 8-bit digit calculator
general 2020-12-31 02:27:35 that was 4-bit, we need 8-bit, which is extremely complex
general 2020-12-31 02:28:13 8 bit calculators can calculate to 255
general 2020-12-31 02:28:46 the game or the server
general 2020-12-31 02:28:58 a few days
general 2020-12-31 02:29:12 i only decided to join recently
general 2020-12-31 02:29:28 i do not want socialization, that's why
general 2020-12-31 02:29:35 k
general 2020-12-31 02:29:38 pog
general 2020-12-31 02:30:11 gay being a bad word is controversial
general 2020-12-31 02:30:42 i guess everything is controversial
general 2020-12-31 02:31:13 sad
general 2020-12-31 02:31:57 does that mean that insults are multi-purpose?
general 2020-12-31 02:32:34 well ok then
general 2020-12-31 02:33:08 if you're a furry for the art, why not.



if you're a furry for anything else then please die
general 2020-12-31 02:33:50 literally the point

creations-chat 2021-01-01 07:06:04 please stop coming to this channel if you cannot take criticism, "ToxIcAsHell".

general 2021-01-02 08:00:31 look at creations-feedback
general 2021-01-02 08:17:36 jesus rick really needs to increase the plot size
general 2021-01-02 08:18:33 im tryna build an extremely large star ship but even folding can't hold it
general 2021-01-02 08:18:42 hmmm
general 2021-01-02 08:18:53 kunmung?
general 2021-01-02 08:19:01 e?
general 2021-01-02 08:19:43 so tell me the story of this all-frowned upon "kunmung"
general 2021-01-02 08:20:07 ban lag machines then
general 2021-01-02 08:20:18 either way
general 2021-01-02 08:20:32 i want information regarding this "kunmung"
general 2021-01-02 08:20:58 *someone ses lag machine* * reports to this server*
general 2021-01-02 08:21:08 not in-game moderation
general 2021-01-02 08:21:15 just to the server
general 2021-01-02 08:21:20 hmmmmm
general 2021-01-02 08:21:36 not that many ppl summon lag machines due to fear tho
general 2021-01-02 08:22:05 like me, who holds a black hole bomb but is too cowardly to spawn it out of fear
general 2021-01-02 08:22:08 ye
general 2021-01-02 08:22:11 votekick
general 2021-01-02 08:22:37 yo shoot that is genius
general 2021-01-02 08:22:41 we REALLY needa votekick system
general 2021-01-02 08:22:57 hmm?
general 2021-01-02 08:23:01 hmmm
general 2021-01-02 08:23:06 good point
general 2021-01-02 08:23:17 but between two evils, a votekick system is lesser
general 2021-01-02 08:23:32 ikr
general 2021-01-02 08:23:43 uhhhh
general 2021-01-02 08:23:47 hmmmm
general 2021-01-02 08:25:49 maybe a votekick system that works like:

*vote kicks *
"DISCUSSION"
*turns out to be abuse *

*kicks the abuser *
general 2021-01-02 08:28:48 but just get a larger plot i suppose
general 2021-01-02 08:28:55 XD
general 2021-01-02 08:28:56 SAD
general 2021-01-02 08:29:28 ikr
general 2021-01-02 08:29:32 anyway
general 2021-01-02 08:29:43 there was someone who backstabbed e from 100 studs
general 2021-01-02 08:30:15 good point
general 2021-01-02 08:30:30 but maybe cutter-to-cutter interaction?
general 2021-01-02 08:30:51 i dont
general 2021-01-02 08:31:01 in fact, i do not know what it does
general 2021-01-02 08:31:05 hmmm
general 2021-01-02 08:31:23 well there was this time where i shredded an entire army of shredders using a giant katana
general 2021-01-02 08:31:29 so cutters are functiona;
general 2021-01-02 08:31:45 what is this
general 2021-01-02 08:31:53 some sort of da vinci invention?
general 2021-01-02 08:31:55 ah
general 2021-01-02 08:31:56 ok
general 2021-01-02 08:32:04 i recognized that da vinci thing
general 2021-01-02 08:32:35 guns = true
general 2021-01-02 08:34:18 guns = true
rockets actually fall for invisible camera walls
fireworks are somewhat OP
water jet = PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH
lava spitter = extremely useful for fast cars (destroys everything)|
tnt balls = useless af cannons
tnt blocks = very good invincible blocks (except from an explosion from foreign tnt)
general 2021-01-02 08:34:53 WHY IS IT PVP THEN
general 2021-01-02 08:36:36 hmmm

general 2021-01-02 09:34:01 you bullied me in-game, whined in creations-feedback for downvoting your bs car, and decided to insult me with some other bully named donut
general 2021-01-02 09:34:14 you ARE
general 2021-01-02 09:34:48 then why did a red avatar join me in-game saying that "YOU CALLED MY CAR STRASH"
general 2021-01-02 09:35:03 red smily avatar
general 2021-01-02 09:35:48 if "ToxicAsHell" isn't you, then good, but the problem is, there is too much evidence saying that you are buggy
general 2021-01-02 09:36:23 ye, and decided to flex his trash car whilst im building a godforsaken generation colony star ship
general 2021-01-02 09:36:37 is this a wrong reply

general 2021-01-02 09:41:16 the other guy's lag machine works, mine is only decorative
general 2021-01-02 09:41:37 (the decor sorta breaks *some* people's game)
general 2021-01-02 09:41:53 then ur pc trash
general 2021-01-02 09:42:08 intel i5
general 2021-01-02 09:42:20 why did he lag then

general 2021-01-02 09:45:53 im studying quadratics
general 2021-01-02 09:46:29 the amount of words he told me in-game and on this server is literally 5 newspaper articles at this point
