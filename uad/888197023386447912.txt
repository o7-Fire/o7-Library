plane-crazy 2022-04-05 13:31:21 well not really, it is the largest cargo plane ever produced, holding the world record for the largest cargo ever airlifted until this day.

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 13:33:34 indeed.
The biggest downfall to it would be the fuel costs. but in plane crazy that dosnt has to be a concern.
