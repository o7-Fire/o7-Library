creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:24:03 motorlock wing panels in for no holes between wings and controlsurfaces
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:27:07 imagine a tool where you can make blocks only weld on specific sides
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:29:51 me wanting to submit stuff to creations and suggestions. mee6 making me lvl1: no
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:32:05 that f18 be F A S T
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:35:39 i have no rank, so i cant ;-;
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:38:25 technically, but like a tool so you could make blocks only weld on specific sides, wich means you could place a motorlock with it not being broken because of the body of the plane for example. hiding motorlocks or making them work without making a part of the plane look bad would be mucheasier
creations-chat 2022-03-05 17:43:27 is it just me that thinks exposed motorlock looks kinda good, but only very rarely

creations-chat 2022-03-06 14:37:12 Took me like half an hour bc i was only texting in here where it has an cooldown, but in other channels like <#497142796961054721> it would be faster because you can type messages more frequently
