The Tale of tracker0857 (351523983260385281)
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:32:32 looks good so far, does it fly well?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:40:50 I would try to make the wings solid, and fix some of the edges
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:44:36 looks like it flys pretty good though
bot-central 2021-07-01 09:45:55 !rank
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:46:38 I've definitely made worse
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:49:08 I more make ships than planes so it would make sense :/

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 09:59:55 quick question, does anyone know if high detail motorlock cars have wheels that actually turn, or is the turning usually similar to a tank?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:00:48 do the motors still turn fine if they're smooshed in, or do they have to have some space?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:01:39 so if a block is halfway inside of the motor will it get stuck?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:02:09 okay, thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:09:05 is there anyway to defend bigger builds against shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:09:45 don't know how good* I can get if my ship is stuck at 60 speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:09:51 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:10:11 I just seem to have too bad of a connection to hit them most times
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:11:36 why don't defensive cutters have any effect on them though?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:13:19 well that sucks
bot-central 2021-07-01 10:16:32 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:14:19 looks decent enough to me
bot-central 2021-07-01 18:23:06 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:32:30 does the catapult actually throw a projecticle?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:34:04 I think if the coloring was a bit darker (personal preference) and the ball was rounded out a little it would be a bit better, looks pretty decent so far though
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:34:07 and cool that it works
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:37:47 I think that makes it a bit better, anything else you'll add?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 18:45:36 it looks more like a cargo ship with a flat top imo
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:49:33 I would try to get a better angle for the actual build
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:50:20 and maybe set a background for the text so it doesn't transition into two colours
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:50:35 but that might just be a personal preference

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 18:54:37 is there a way to get a smooth slope in a 1 by 6 space?
general 2021-07-01 18:59:35 My ship so far, any obvious things to improve on?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 19:01:16 okay, thanks would that still have a straight curve, or would it slightly change angle
general 2021-07-01 19:01:45 Will do
general 2021-07-01 19:02:58 I wanted to when I finished touching it up ever so slightly
general 2021-07-01 19:03:07 but I'll try to make landing space in the back
general 2021-07-01 19:03:29 thank you for your guy's feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:32:47 what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:35:18 I'll have to look into that, any thoughts on how I can improve it?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:41:09 
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:43:09 <@!714878625484243101> I have the cannons actually protrude from the ship, but do you mean something else?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:33:47 maybe half wedges
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:51:04 oof
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:53:10 thanks for being honest I suppose, I'm fairly new to motor locking so I left the train mostly bulky
bot-central 2021-07-01 21:15:42 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:17:56 yeah I think it would count as an aeronautical build
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:18:03 "I think"
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:20:50 google says a helicopter with intertwining rotors
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:21:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:22:26 do the rotors go quickly, or do they need to be slower so they don't glitch into one another?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:28:38 sounds cool

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:30:20 I was going to make a heli pad in the back on 3
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:30:41 but I was also thinking of moving it up to the first circle
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:30:48 does anyone have any thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:34:37 alright, makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:34:38 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 00:39:04 Honestly, I just used cameras just because I knew they would work fine, I've never used signs before
creations-chat 2021-07-02 02:06:57 It was my first train build so I wasn't going for realism to be honest, but I still see what you mean
general 2021-07-02 07:44:38 anyone have any idea when a rank ticket would be looked at?
general 2021-07-02 07:46:36 I posted my ticket earlier, just didn't know if I should expect a few hours or a few days, not impatient or anything though
general 2021-07-02 07:52:17 <@!370594904268734464> do you get a ton of tickets each day?
general 2021-07-02 07:52:42 makes sense
bot-central 2021-07-02 08:01:41 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:20:18 Hey, so my sign will be uncensored
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:20:23 and then randomly censor
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:20:31 but other signs that say the same thing are not
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:20:34 any ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:21:17 lol, sounds bout right
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:24:33 retyped, new sign, still censored :/
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 23:29:27 Thanks for the suggestion, but roblox just won't have it
creations-chat 2021-07-03 19:33:40 <@!805650482940477451>  I like the slope of the jet, looks good
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:04:05 I'm trying to make a classic looking car
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:04:09 this is it so far
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:04:12 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:04:16 any thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:04:32

plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:14:54 ZIS-101A Sport (1938)
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:14:59 is what the model says
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:27 I'm still not too sure what to do with the rear
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:16:31 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:17:17 
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:17:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:17:30 that might work out
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:19:05 I'll try to see if I can smooth it out
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 05:20:14 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 05:59:02 Classic car I'm working on any thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 06:08:13 thanks, any ideas on what I can improve on it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 06:12:15 <@!723940197456281640> will do
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:18:33 Improved the front slightly
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:19:06 thanks, any feedback?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:25:54 I can see that :/
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:25:56 
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:31:42 maybe a Humvee then
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:32:02 if thats what you mean
help 2021-07-25 10:09:22 hey so, on my ship I have four main guns and 3 of them aim correctly with motor 2s but my fourth wont aim up for some reason
help 2021-07-25 10:09:26 
help 2021-07-25 10:09:38 is there any reason for this?
help 2021-07-25 10:10:34 <@!504577008383033344> not in reverse
help 2021-07-25 10:10:47 and I'll try spawning it at the base and water a couple of times to see if it changes
help 2021-07-25 10:16:00 yeah they seem to be working now
help 2021-07-25 10:16:12 
help 2021-07-25 10:16:22 good tip on the reverse though if they start acting up consistently again
help 2021-07-25 10:16:30 didnt think of that for some reason
help 2021-07-25 10:16:40 thanks

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:33:46 <@!723940197456281640> the rigging is in progress and I'm trying to figure out a way to make small decent looking cannons, but will do thanks for the feedback!
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 10:09:08 A pic of my ship still in progress
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 10:09:26 (apologies for the very weird angle)
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 10:10:14 thanks, let me know if there's anything you think I can improve on
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 10:36:30 nice chairs lol
creations-chat 2021-08-07 07:29:49 <@!758525515362992160> Despite it being a strip club I actually think the interior/lighting is pretty good, nice job
creations-chat 2021-08-08 03:44:02 <@!99607451300548608> Very cool concept and good execution, if you were to make another but a little smoother I think it could look extremely good

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:13:29 I'm trying to make ship rigging with camera lock and trails, does anyone know any drawbacks to this before I go all in?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:14:39 I've realized the reseting with the camera lock, but no fps drops or anything with copious amounts?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:15:22 okay, thanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:20:07 My corvette hull so far

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 06:51:01 My corvette ship so far, let me know if you have any suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 06:53:24 vertically?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 06:56:07 Guns aren't added yet, I want to make them detailed
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 06:57:18 yeah, I wanted to detail them with motorlock, but wanted to do that last so I didn't get a headache too early
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 22:02:19 
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 22:02:21 my destroyer is nearly done
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 22:04:01 I got a little carried away
creations-chat 2021-08-31 21:44:22 <@!830883571119423539> That Metallica logo looks pretty sick man, good job
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:50:28 <@!527653676022628353> you might be right, but the gun amount and sizes are comparable to a cruiser
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:54:36 because the size of my ship, and the ship it was based off of aren't large enough imo
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:58:40 I tried to recreate this
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:01:21 <@!527653676022628353> I appreciate you calling me out on the details though, it's the little things that matter
creations-chat 2021-09-18 20:58:38 <@!431881268775616513> Nice river boat man, I always wanted to make one, well done
creations-chat 2021-10-24 20:53:41 my attempt at a flower corvette, what do you guys think?
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 07:14:12 I'm making a new ship, this is the hull so far. Any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 07:35:51 its meant to end up as something like this, but its probably a long shot
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 07:35:53 
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 07:37:42 Yeah, I think I need to try to angle lock it some more
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 07:40:50 I'll keep trying to get a good shape, thanks for the feedback
general 2022-04-03 12:00:16 
creations-chat 2022-04-06 07:48:39 <@!683066163068010524> thanks, tried my best to make it accurate
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:13:32 <@!720891502108344360> not willing to redo all the camera locking atm, but here some pics on the plot
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:15:48 glad you liked her
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:18:23 <@!721103577380159490> Thank you, hardest part was getting the shape right, and the color palette, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out though
creations-chat 2022-07-03 14:49:49 <@385421093969854465> The ship looks pretty good, and nice job on the rigging, I would just add more detail to the hull
