creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:53:04 feedback on my F-4 phantom so far? (it does have landing gear it's hidden well though)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:55:09 it's my second ever angle locked plane so far so its not the best
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:58:19 what did i do wrong
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:00:24 does mine look good so far? I want to make good planes as my last one, my A-10, looks kinda good and has ungodly amounts of angle lock, but is literally 1 block wide and looks bad because of it
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:05:54 i've been playing plane crazy for like 1 and a half years now but i made my first angle locked plane not long ago, the A-10, which i don't like (for obvious reasons)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:08:23 actually the phantom isn't my 2nd its my third, i forgot i started a C-130J a while ago, i'll post the pics under this
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 04:09:16 💀
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 04:09:22 ik its not good
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 04:10:43 im probably not gonna finish my C-130J but idk
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:11:13 is this a good or a bad oh ok
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:16:46 now you can violently murder people and show your pride
creations-chat 2022-08-04 05:56:30 I'm working on a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, a old 4 prop engine airliner
help 2022-08-04 05:57:33 anyone wanna help me improve or just get feedback on my wip plane
help 2022-08-04 05:58:54 in <#504436696021204992>
help 2022-08-04 05:58:57 just posted it
help 2022-08-04 05:59:09 i posted more info about it there
help 2022-08-04 05:59:29 yeah i couldn't find anything else
help 2022-08-04 05:59:54 it does rotate though but idk what to do about the emojis
help 2022-08-04 06:00:11 💀
help 2022-08-04 06:01:03 yeah those are good ones but the L-1049 has only one center screen (which idk how to fit in but i'll figure it out)
help 2022-08-04 06:01:26 i used the dials and slider emojis a lot
help 2022-08-04 06:01:32 as well as a lot of the clock emojis
help 2022-08-04 06:01:41 the stopwatch censors so i can't use that
help 2022-08-04 06:02:11 oh btw, i'm also making the plane ro-scale, as in meters to plane crazy blocks
help 2022-08-04 06:02:54 haven't made an airliner in about a year now i think
help 2022-08-04 06:03:08 made one a year ago when i was newer and it sucked (obviously)
help 2022-08-04 06:03:28 I wanna try again at it, although they're very laggy for me cause chromebook
help 2022-08-04 06:03:45 do you think the plane itself looks good so far though?
help 2022-08-05 04:54:39 added more things to interior and added landing gear that hides itself well, any thoughts?
help 2022-08-05 04:55:33 i'll make the landing gear look better in a bit its still a big WIP
help 2022-08-05 05:17:17 it's a lockheed L-1049, look it up if you wanna see more of its design
help 2022-08-05 05:17:28 yeah but i have some limits with that
help 2022-08-05 05:17:53 its as good as i can make it without not being able to make it angled locked
help 2022-08-05 05:20:46 it already is pretty complicated with angle lock and lots of motor locking on just the front, i want to save space on it as much as i can
help 2022-08-05 05:21:21 i don't wanna put too much then lose motivation to continue because i put all my energy on the front of the plane
help 2022-08-05 05:21:48 plus it doesn't need to be spot on
help 2022-08-05 05:22:02 i just wanna have a airliner to take people on trips with
help 2022-08-05 07:38:05 Idk how we'd do that
help 2022-08-05 07:38:24 Ohh
help 2022-08-05 07:38:32 Alr
help 2022-08-05 07:38:43 I can friend you tomorrow as I'm not on my computer rn
help 2022-08-05 07:38:53 Tomorrow
help 2022-08-05 07:39:00 it's not super complicated so far
help 2022-08-05 07:39:04 but it looks good
help 2022-08-05 07:39:36 If you wanna find some good liveries search Lockheed L-1049
help 2022-08-05 07:40:10 Btw, this is one of my first airliners as Im not good with planes
help 2022-08-05 07:40:46 I'm on Chromebook so I lag a lot but I'm getting a actual PC soon
help 2022-08-05 07:40:57 so I won't be lagging really bad forever
help 2022-08-05 07:42:02 The joystick steering things move but I hid the motors so they're hard to see
help 2022-08-05 07:42:17 I've never worked with someone when making a plane before
help 2022-08-05 07:44:41 oh I didn't save pictures but I made the landing gear look a lot better
general 2022-08-07 02:09:36 my brotha
general 2022-08-07 02:11:40 rickje just dropped some fire info today

help 2022-08-07 23:33:56 
help 2022-08-07 23:34:10 how does it look so far
help 2022-08-07 23:34:45 (this pic was before all the new stuff but it has opening doors
help 2022-08-07 23:35:14 It's a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation
help 2022-08-07 23:35:25 the longer version of the constellation
help 2022-08-07 23:35:42 it's an old 4 prop airliner
help 2022-08-07 23:36:11 made in 1940's-50's
help 2022-08-07 23:37:05 here's some inside pics
help 2022-08-07 23:37:17 i don't have a picture of the front fully angle locked let me get on rq
help 2022-08-07 23:37:33 
help 2022-08-07 23:37:47 it has landing gear too that is well hidden
help 2022-08-07 23:38:42 (ignore the spring)
help 2022-08-07 23:39:08 yeah some people called it the best prop airliner ever
help 2022-08-07 23:39:19 very pretty plane
help 2022-08-07 23:40:42 yup it did
help 2022-08-07 23:41:10 yeah all the seats were first class
help 2022-08-07 23:41:30 they made an economy one later on but it had few of them built
help 2022-08-07 23:42:08 i only have the stewards area done, i believe that's what it is
help 2022-08-07 23:43:05 the disconnectors are gonna be painted white and it'll look better when finished
help 2022-08-07 23:43:19 still got a lot of seats to place
help 2022-08-07 23:43:32 it can hold over 100 people from what i remember
help 2022-08-07 23:44:08 47-106 apparently
help 2022-08-07 23:44:31 including the 5 crew
help 2022-08-07 23:44:41 so i need to place 101 seats
help 2022-08-08 00:34:55 sorry but if i want to do a good landing in it i cannot remove that suspension
help 2022-08-09 00:05:17 dude this is one of the coolest things i've ever seen in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-08-16 19:38:30 it's not bad

plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:05:49 this is really bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:05:55 look
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:06:40 
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:06:51 go from bottom to top
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:07 i need to color the text
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:09 not the sign
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:19 i did
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:23 i rejoined as well
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:38 no, all of them are broken
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:07:45 text and signs are broken
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:08:02 if i try and edit them after it makes my sign edit invisible
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:08:15 roblox fucked up something
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:08:25 damn
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:08:29 good

plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:09:33 btw, to make your sign edit visible again, replace the sign/text
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:11:10 apparently you can't use the paint dropper on text either
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:11:27 damn it
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:12:15 click and drag?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:13:31 OH
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:13:35 THANK YOU
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 00:13:51 you just saved me a lot of painting issues
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:38:28 are we allowed to talk about wip builds we have here
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:38:52 you can't post wip in creations
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:41:17 k anyway how does my foxbody look so far, its a 1991 5.0
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 01:41:40 its like my second or third time making a angle locked car
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:37:26 ok go make a better one with no angle lock, i'll wait
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:40:32 how u talking when this is the kinda shit you make
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:42:58 that means it's hidden well, if you didn't need glasses as big as the fucking empire state building you might see the obviously locked angles
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:45:05 not all of it the same color, there's darker and lighter accents that you can't see unless you're in game, also the headlights and pillars are all locked, pillars are each locked twice (one inward one rotated)
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:47:37 alr
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:50:05 i'm not fighting anymore
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:53:19 because i'm not gonna continue an argument with someone who's mind hasn't developed past 6 months old
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:56:41 i'm not responding to you anymore, goodbye, shut up, leave me be, go find someone else to annoy about how their build isn't accurate because "you missed this by 0.0001 meter 🤓"
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:59:37 that's a different story, actually bad builds are downvoted for a reason
creations-chat 2022-09-25 01:03:27 my entire life crumbling before my eyes becuse queasysquiddy told me my build wasn't good:
creations-chat 2022-09-25 01:32:43 ALSO i forgot to say i also angle locked the hood

creations-chat 2022-10-14 23:57:21 from what i've seen of your builds you make children's toy car scaled builds so shut the fuck up kindly

creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:09:53 you think smaller means better when in reality everything i've seen that's roscale is terrible and looks like the worst thing ever to touch planet earth, you the type of person to look at a build with someone's arms sticking out and upvote it
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:11:59 THAT is proper ro-scale, most ro-scale is way smaller then real life and it usually looks terrible

creations-chat 2022-11-16 05:42:18 hows my M2A2 look so far, i need someones opinion , its not 100% roscale but if roblox characters were just a bit taller it'd be roscale
creations-chat 2022-11-16 05:44:30 im rusty at making tanks as my last one was like 4 months ago i think, and i've only ever made a handful of tanks

creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:02:16 good, the person below me doesn't appreciate simple things
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:06:40 i don't care if he's jesus christ himself, he needs to learn to get the stick outta his ass and see that not everyone is a pro as soon as they start playing, im not saying the wings are good or bad they're simple and well hidden
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:14:05 what do i expect from someone with a old dead cat meme pfp
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:16:09 i could easily get multiple different colors and ranks if i asked for them<:ElonMenacing:715271505088479537>, it's a choice not a skill statement
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:18:36 i like watching people think they're better because they have a color, like great job you learned your colors bud!
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:20:39 "haha i have the 24 pack of crayons!! you stupid 10 pack peasants are weaker" like bro nobody gives a shit about your fucking color
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:22:46 i think he finally realized how stupid he sounded and shut up about colors, so now i can show the rest of my progress on the M2A2
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:24:50 works well though since orange circles get hashtagged

plane-crazy 2022-11-26 11:45:58 it has weak tail points so usually when i get hit in the tail the whole thing falls off and i go into a death spin from the imbalance

plane-crazy 2022-12-02 06:42:11 nah it doesn't have that
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 06:42:29 but the engine is very similar to mine with a few differences
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 06:43:57 my engine can barely power itself
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 06:44:14 i mean it can move a wheel if i set it up to a driveshaft
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 06:44:33 uh i can't get on rn

creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:56:42 funnily enough you are wrong, look how shitty this is but it has almost 50 upvotes cause its from a youtuber
creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:58:44 boxness is just a good builder, im saying if you're a well known person you'll get more upvotes because of it
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:25:08 i like the plane airframe thing with he landing gear, great job kinda looks like an A-10 and some kinda bomber
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:54:19 MTDU MK II (the name has been changed since the MK I)

creations-chat 2022-12-03 05:46:08 just needs paint now, can someone rate this
creations-chat 2022-12-03 05:49:13 really??, btw the reason it looks a  little bare and some parts aren't fitted is because it's a bare bones mech chassis made for military to buy and turn into their own, basically imagine a giant metal build a bear
creations-chat 2022-12-03 05:54:18 it's only my second ever mech so i'm surprised you gave it such a high score (reason it looks good is cause i've played for a long time) I'm not really good at getting these things to walk
creations-chat 2022-12-03 05:59:38 they look nothing alike

creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:59:12 WIP BF-109 (i know the prop looks off it was hard enough to fit a 3 bladed angle lock in there AND make it spin)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:03:54 i am sorry yall had to see the first pic i realized how wrong i got some things, here's a more accurate one
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:06:12 it looks ok for a one wide, but i think one wides are ugly  and they make me want to throw up so i'm probably not the best person to ask
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:08:28 btw, idk if you're good with prop planes but how does my BF 109 look (second pic not first one)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:10:51 yes you are correct it does look kinda big now that i see it, can someone but the bp for the BF-109 over my side view? i would but idk how
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:16:42 nvm but i am pretty close to being accurate, just need to move some things (i physically cannot move the propeller in sadly)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:20:13 what??
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:24:25 i still have no idea what you mean are you talking about the blueprint or what
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:27:45 
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:34:28 so is it good so far or no
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:45:27 can you check again and see if this is still accurate, i just wanna see if the back wing is accurately sized
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:47:43 alr thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:59:37 i can make the props bigger but thats about it

creations-chat 2022-12-08 23:32:32 that's how you find how accurate it is.. yes??
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:18:23 so you're saying that a side profile matchup with blueprints is wrong and that it's not correct because you said so
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:20:50 prove it
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:23:11 nobody but you has commented on it, people have been using blueprints ontop of their plane crazy builds for years, if it's such common sense why has nobody said anything?
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:25:20 don't care lol, go cry to someone else because i honestly do not care whatsoever

creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:11:51 there is so many things wrong with that
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:13:59 war thunder's models are accurate, your recreation is not
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:16:02 i don't need to make one to criticize you, yours is just bad all around, if you want i can go ahead and tell you all the things wrong about it
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:18:08 even if you are basing yours off "the one from war thunder", it's still inaccurate
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:20:30 big≠good
if you're gonna make something big you have to make it look good or else the bad things are just even easier to notice
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:24:00 wtf you mean, im saying you can't make something shitty and big then call it good cause its "to scale" idiot ☠️ ☠️  i was literally saying that because it's to scale doesn't make it good
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:26:10 yes that looks like shit too
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:28:50 that one sucks i deleted that version
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:31:32 at least my builds are accurate to what they try to remake
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:33:50 sorry i let you know your builds suck  ☠️ (they do)
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:36:29 most sane shader user (if they didn't use them we might find out they can't build that well!!1<:clueless:942802644043464734>)
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:39:35 as you can see, a wild shader user is in it's natural habitat, sending unfunny responses because they got called out
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:41:40 damn bro that was mad funny 😐
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:43:47 wings are too thick, also not shaped correctly, tail wings are way too small, the top window doesn't even have any separators at all, propellers look to be wrong as well, the engine covers are supposed to be thicker than the wing, no lettering on the wings, and the nose is misshaped
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:45:48 oh yeah thanks for showing me, the wings also aren't angled up like in the photo you just sent to show us how "accurate" yours was (you can very clearly see a bend in the wings from the real photo you sent)  <:clueless:942802644043464734>, also yes them are some minecraft ass wings

creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:16:39 you must be thinking pretty hard about what other ways you can try and prove to me you're somehow better when in fact you are not

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:38:54 minecraft wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:39:16 i can literally see the cheese grader wings you have on that thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:39:48 uh no you just did a terrible job remaking it
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:40:21 you can't accept it can you
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:40:34 multiple people have told you that your builds are shit (they are)
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:40:44 you refuse to accept it
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:41:19 i'm not sure if it's sad or funny watching you try and make excuses as to why you're actually good at building
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:42:08 mods don't give a shit lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:42:23 actually i think both
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:42:40 he likes anime which just adds on to the fact he's shit at building
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:42:50 anime is cringe
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:43:20 we already know that
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:43:37 it's clear from the builds you've posted
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:44:48 major cringe detected
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:45:27 the point is you suck at building, stop denying it
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:45:39 and you're also cringe

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:46:40 you've posted the nerd gif for the third time now
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:46:52 damn bro you must like doing face reveals
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:47:09 your only argument is one build i have vs 3 of yours
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:47:33 sounds to me like you're leaving out my other builds so people don't see that i'm better then you
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:47:48 plus my pigeon is 10x better then your minecraft ahh builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:48:04 those all look like shit, the middle one is the least shit but still shit
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:48:23 the middle one looks ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:48:43 WTF IS THAT
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:48:49 im gonna be sick
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:49:14 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:49:26 rick is probably focused on pc2 rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:49:36 which is good
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:50:14 didn't he say it was 90% done like months and months ago
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:51:29 what's the difference between the rewrite and pc2
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:51:51 thought so
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:52:10 thank god maybe now cargo planes can carry things
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:52:39 yall think rick is gonna be able to make collisions between player's builds work right
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:53:18 they should be a option to turn on/off
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:53:39 cause wouldn't angle locking break if they added that
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:54:10 angle locking uses motor which moves parts into eachother really quickly, which might cause the blocks to break
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:55:34 hopefully pc2 comes out soon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:55:41 like early 2023
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:55:56 i want machine guns
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:56:33 i think basically having a tank gun would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:02 20mm would be probably the default gun we have now
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:30 plane crazy jetpack joyride
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:57:45 i can do that if i wanted to
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:58:01 i'll do it later actually
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:58:09 jesus
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:58:15 sturmtiger pigeon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:58:29 alright i'll make a sturmtiger pigeon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:59:14 give me suggestions on what to turn my pigeon into
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:59:48 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:00:37 or just put a tank turret on a pigeon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:00:49 or put a pigeon on a tank
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:01:07 thats what i meant by this
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:01:14 pigeon launcher
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:01:26 it just throws a pigeon at the target
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:02:35 so the turret body is a pigeon but the gun is still there just on the pigeon
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:03:07 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:03:15 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:03:25 wait what
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:03:32 so there is 2 turrets
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:03:43 sounds good to me
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:07:23 "you've got a hole in your left wing"

creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:00:50 we cant see functionality in a picture, plus nobody here cares for function they care about looks
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:03:04 i make sure to mention flaps and landing gear but in reality its just a waste cause nobody really sees stuff for functions
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:05:09 i myself enjoy seeing functionality and looks together, best of both, but if something looks bad and has good function im a lot more likely to downvote but if it has good looks and bad function im more likely to upvote ONE EXCEPTION is swashplates/mechanical functions showcases, those i just upvote cause they aint supposed to look good
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:07:41 most of that looks good but that nose is enough to kinda ruin the whole thing, if you just fixed the nose with some angle lock it would probably get a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-12-29 08:31:27 are the vertical stabilizers supposed to be straight

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:30:21 I mean I've never made a ship before so sure
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:30:58 I'm more of a land and air vehicle builder
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:31:36 I've tried before
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:31:41 not as easy as it sounds
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:31:52 I've done it but only with a simple base not a full build
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:34:17 it worked, did the job I made it to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:34:28 took quite a bit of trial and error though
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:05:08 i knew the first 5 seconds after i posted someone would complain ☠️
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:08:13 oh dang thats funny coming from you
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:10:34 can't have exposed lock when there is no lock ☠️
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:12:38 you using a motor 2 to angle the "side pipes" doesn't count as angle lock ,that's just angling also i see a exposed motor <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:14:43 wowie you used one simple angle lock, yet it still looks like shit! amazing! you're welcome
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:27:33 would you rather me have no suspension?? i couldn't fit any other suspension in
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:29:39 still has it though, if im gonna race at the airport let's say i'm gonna need some suspension to not get launched when i hit the corner of the tarmac or concrete parts
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:31:46 i made the ride height better for you hunny 🥺 🥺
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:36:50 barely still means it's there..??

general 2023-01-15 09:02:23 because they either make it stable or motor lock wings in

general 2023-01-15 09:05:05 tracking on rockets are bad for everyone
general 2023-01-15 09:05:39 if you're really accurate with your rocket shots no but if you suck at aiming then yes
general 2023-01-15 09:05:48 for you yes
general 2023-01-15 09:07:49 ping is a really big factor with rockets
general 2023-01-15 09:08:00 yeah

plane-crazy 2023-03-03 02:31:16 tnt car tried to kill me
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 03:36:54 probably not, not even multiple hits from a row of rockets kills it instantly
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 05:21:40 i just said it can survive multiple rows of missiles
the-dump 2023-03-03 07:12:00 
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 21:35:27 you'd be mistaken
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 21:59:05 what atgm
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 21:59:15 you don't specify the firepower
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 21:59:21 is it one tnt or multiple
general 2023-03-03 22:02:44 on god
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 22:07:45 set them to a period and smallest text size
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 22:08:14 signs are glitched
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 22:08:21 you gotta edit them from the back
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 22:08:36 if you have that happen you have to completely replace the sign
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:05:20 a large atgm might do some damage
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:05:31 probably take out the turret possibly
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:05:34 but that's it
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:40:05 unlikely
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:40:21 if you can even hit the tank in first place
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:40:33 it's fast and agile so good luck
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:41:46 as well as there being plenty of angle lock in the front and extra disconnector protection, over a tnt base
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:42:20 so i find it hard to believe you could actually kill it with one shot
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:43:51 even with a large ATGM it probably would take 2-3 hits
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:45:34 the tnt car that hit me hit me in a weak spot on my tank, right next to me
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:45:39 it was an entire wall of tnt
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:45:53 so i don't think a single ATGM to a heavily armored front would do shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:46:21 however
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:46:46 if you use a cluster bomb or cluster missile it would probably fuck it up
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:46:56 might not kill it instantly if you're using a cluster missile
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:47:11 but a cluster bomb would absolutely turn it to dust
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:47:18 if you hit it right on
plane-crazy 2023-03-03 23:49:15 wow, you are so funny

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:05:34 which is kind of weird
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:05:41 because it should be the exact opposite

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:05:06 because they had millions of people on their game at once
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:06:28 nothing has any players
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:06:47 half balls on both clutch ends (no clue what the actual term is)
