help 2022-12-26 23:36:54 I cannot get my rocket to go strait up with no help, and Iv checked to make sure that its not more weighted or uneven on a certain side. I have no idea what's making it go sideways every time.

help 2023-02-15 22:43:25 https://streamable.com/e4ur20 So I made a ranger from Interstellar, and I made it so all the weight is in the back of the craft and the yellow dot and blue dot are near the back. Every time I fly it however, it dips down and I have to constantly press up in order for it to not go down. I have no idea why its doing this :/
