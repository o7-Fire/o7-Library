general 2023-01-16 19:17:03 I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus, He died for our sins on the cross so we can get a chance and live with him in heaven! Even if we sin, he still loves us and believes in forgiveness, how can we be sorry to him about our sins? By repenting! Repent every sin you made to Jesus Christ and by far the most important thing... Rejoice him! Rejoice in him now, later, or always! Jesus is always there for you, for me, and for everyone, he made a promise to forgive all of us and be his righteous disciples! Hear my message, share it with other people to spread the gospel, and rejoice in him! Amen!🙏 💌
