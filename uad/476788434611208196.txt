bug-reports 2020-05-16 21:06:14 I don't have prove because I rage quit the game,
but anyways, I had a save for an aircraft carrier with 640 parts and then I loaded something else, then loaded the aircraft carrier again and apparently something else that was on that file that i didnt save onto that file, and so I lost my bloody aircraft carrier....

**and I'm guessing that since saves are a thing, you have a datastore thing**
