plane-crazy 2021-01-13 22:19:42 Largest build I could find was 8k however there are most likely bigger ones they just didn’t have the block count
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 22:22:10 Oh I know they were just the only builds that had a block count attached

help 2021-04-17 20:12:51 im working on an airship build and im not sure if helium blocks with the centre option apply it to the centre of a build when its unfolded or does it also apply when its unfolded? like does it also apply to the centre of the unfolded or where the original centre was while it was folded
