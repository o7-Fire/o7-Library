The Tale of PP777 (740396272028221483)
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 03:31:06 Hello, I'm new to the server; I joined on my kid's behalf because he's got some pretty cool ideas for Plane Crazy that he wants to share wherever Rick or Madattak could potentially see them. The first idea is to have radars that could detect motors, rocket engines or propellers in movement (it would be awesome to be able to tell where other players' machines are in pvp). Next, he suggests that there be weapons and armor that could be carried by players. He also thinks that having seats be activated by a key when near them would be far better that to just have them make you sit automatically. Finally, he would really like visual effects added to the game like dust flying off when a vehicle passes where there's dirt or shots being visible on machines in pvp. He wants me to textually give this message as well: "PLANE CRAZY IS AN AMAZING GAME BECAUSE IT LETS YOU UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY AND I LOVE THE ANGRY SQUIRREL SOUND MOTORS MAKE :V"
