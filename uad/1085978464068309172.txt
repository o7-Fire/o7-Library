plane-crazy 2023-04-04 18:40:20 why wont whitelisting be added to plane crazy? it would make the game more immersive and fun if saving is the problem they dont need to add that
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 18:41:55 If you're building alone constantly for months on end you will eventually feel the need to quit the game for a few months to take a breather whitelisting or teambuilding would counter that and make it more replayable
