contest-chat 2022-07-11 12:02:26 I only recently made it.
contest-chat 2022-07-11 12:03:34 ....That's actually a fair point.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 22:31:52 ....Help.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 22:39:18 Tell me about it.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 23:03:49 
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:36:34 Why are horizontal Motor 2s always unstable when they're connected to a vertical Motor 2-
creations-chat 2022-07-15 23:45:21 Why is the bot not allowing us to upvote that hovercraft-
creations-chat 2022-07-15 23:48:30 The one that <@927438201503772682> made yesterday-
general 2022-07-29 04:46:27 Anyone else getting sick of the new death sound?
contest-chat 2022-07-30 01:39:17 Choose dinos for the contest. I can do it easily.
contest-chat 2022-07-30 01:39:36 Well- many people can really.
contest-chat 2022-07-30 14:20:22 Guys, we need more votes on 1.
contest-chat 2022-07-30 14:22:12 Honestly, I'm kinda surprised they picked cleaning supplies over dinos- XD
contest-chat 2022-07-30 18:12:29 Some ordinary thing over a living thing from 65M+ years ago?
events-chat 2022-07-30 18:16:40 Can we talk about how cleaning supplies has more votes than dinosaurs-
general 2022-08-02 04:31:13 Why do horizontal Motor 2's always go crazy when they're connected to a vertical one.
general 2022-08-02 04:32:10 When you put a motor 2 on another one, they go crazy.
general 2022-08-02 04:32:55 THEN WHY DOES IT HAPPEN TO ME?
general 2022-08-02 04:35:36 Why does making a ball joint with two motors just never work.
general 2022-08-14 19:41:37 I just thought of something.
general 2022-08-14 19:41:53 Someone makes a chameleon with a seat on its tongue.
general 2022-08-14 19:43:25 Someone should make a kidnapping chameleon tho.
general 2022-08-14 19:52:15 Accurate.
general 2022-08-16 05:20:20 Y'know, they gotta add a way to make motors swivel back and forth.

Y'know, like a fish tail, or a snake.
general 2022-08-16 05:22:21 Hi dad. /j
creations-chat 2022-08-16 08:24:47 Here's a list of Jurassic World stuff I'm making or have already made.
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:05:22 <@654837629874864140> Love that seaplane.
creations-chat 2022-08-19 03:07:59 Thx.
creations-chat 2022-08-19 03:35:52 Thx.
creations-chat 2022-08-19 04:44:51 It usually flies better than this, idk what's up with it today.
creations-chat 2022-08-19 06:22:12 Oh cool.
general 2022-08-22 16:26:01 Tbh, I feel like they should make it so that you can play multiple sounds in one speaker.
general 2022-08-22 16:26:17 Like, playing a different sound with each keybind.
general 2022-08-22 16:28:59 My build can only fit one.
general 2022-08-24 04:02:40 I take it no one here's ever built something immune to lava.
general 2022-08-27 00:07:25 Imagine there was an acid PVP weapon that melts through builds over time.
general 2022-08-27 00:07:55 One.
general 2022-08-27 13:54:01 Y'know, Roblox should make a chrome material.
general 2022-08-27 13:56:01 Can't use it in this game if I make it myself can I.
general 2022-08-27 13:56:43 Oh.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 15:14:59 Has anyone tried making any of these before?
contest-chat 2022-09-03 01:46:02 Honestly,



Very surprised that third one managed to win.
general 2022-09-18 22:23:13 Hey why didn't the gold bars come back this year?
general 2022-09-18 22:23:32 Ok.
general 2022-09-18 22:23:48 Lemme see what it looks like compared to Shark's.
general 2022-09-18 22:23:55 Ok, cool-
general 2022-09-18 22:24:04 Oh nice-

general 2022-09-21 21:47:58 How many ways can you make a hover engine.
general 2022-09-21 22:22:23 How many ways can you make a hover engine.
general 2022-09-21 22:22:48 Glitch engine.
general 2022-09-21 22:24:54 Which motor?
general 2022-09-22 02:05:42 Ok signs are broken.

general 2022-09-22 02:07:44 Yea right, at ***10:07 PM.*** /j
general 2022-09-22 02:08:07 I put /j for a reason.
general 2022-09-22 02:08:35 Joking.
general 2022-09-22 02:09:51 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-09-22 21:45:19 You guys already know the situation so I won't even bother mentioning it.
general 2022-09-22 21:57:08 Good news; Roblox is back up.

Bad news; Signs are still broken.
general 2022-09-22 22:00:40 Wait they're fixed?
general 2022-09-22 22:30:43 We're aware.
general 2022-09-22 23:28:31 Is there a fix for the S I G N S yet.

general 2022-10-06 01:33:42 This guy.
general 2022-10-06 01:34:02 Anyways, have signs been fixed yet?
general 2022-10-06 01:38:48 Sign fix when.
general 2022-10-06 01:39:20 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-10-11 00:41:56 Sure hope they're fixing the signs.
general 2022-10-17 22:33:37 I feel like they should add fall suff.
general 2022-10-17 22:34:14 Idk.

Leafblowers probably?
general 2022-10-17 22:34:53 Preeeeetty much.
general 2022-10-17 22:38:29 .....What- That doesn't even add up to 100.
creations-chat 2022-10-18 01:54:06 I don't think this guy has any idea what a Pteranodon is.
general 2022-11-20 15:37:17 It's been a bit.

Are signs fixed yet?
general 2022-11-20 15:43:43 Are signs fixed yet?
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 20:18:27 Too bad this isn't Plane Crazy.

plane-crazy 2022-12-20 15:07:53 <@498937968015441941>
general 2022-12-23 23:20:05 ...Did they forget to add the winter map or something?
general 2022-12-23 23:21:05 The boats.
general 2022-12-28 11:44:52 They
general 2022-12-28 11:45:08 They've forgotten about the winter map, haven't they.
general 2022-12-30 02:06:39 Still no winter map?
general 2022-12-30 02:07:54 Makes sense.
general 2023-02-04 13:29:01 I take it signs still aren't fixed?
general 2023-02-05 22:03:10 I take it signs are still broken-
general 2023-02-05 23:05:10 So for some reason the audio I uploaded works on the website but not in the game-?
general 2023-02-05 23:06:44 Oh chiseled is here?
general 2023-02-05 23:08:37 There's already blocks.
general 2023-02-05 23:08:52 Oh.
general 2023-02-05 23:10:38 ........So how do I fix this?
general 2023-02-05 23:15:55 Does anyone know how to fix this or no?
general 2023-02-05 23:16:24 ......How long did it take you to make that-
general 2023-02-05 23:16:42 Fair enough-
general 2023-02-05 23:17:26 Shut.
general 2023-02-05 23:17:51 ........But why does it still play on the website and why can i still hear other player's sounds-
general 2023-02-05 23:19:24 Huh.
general 2023-03-31 17:16:47 Aresignsfixedyet-
general 2023-03-31 17:18:01 Yea but are signs fixed-
general 2023-05-03 17:24:52 If those signs ain't fixed yet, Idek what to say at this point-
general 2023-05-03 17:25:28 I swear it's been broken for at least a year now-
general 2023-05-22 00:38:42 I take it signs aren't fixed yet-
general 2023-05-22 00:39:04 Anyways, a symetry feature would be pretty cool-
general 2023-07-01 21:24:19 I take it those signs still aren't fixed yet-
general 2023-07-07 12:16:17 **For the last time, are signs fixed yet.**
general 2023-07-07 12:23:15 Sooo I didn't read that far at that point.

But yes.
general 2023-07-07 12:23:34 **But finally.** Took em long enough.
general 2023-07-07 13:55:24 Sign coloring is still a bit glitched.


But for the most part it's fine.
contest-chat 2023-07-07 16:41:41 Ngl, movie scenes doesn't sound like a bad idea.
