bug-reports 2020-07-03 19:23:04 maybe have blacklist clear the debris instead of resetting?

creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:29:31 my ~500 dollar pc runs roblox at max graphics
creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:29:47 phantom forces at 60 dayum fps
creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:30:10 because price-performance ratio and the ability to easily repair/upgrade

creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:32:47 im too poor to have it
creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:33:15 but i used fps unlocker (my screen capped at 60 so boohoo) and got mid 200 fps in phantom forces max gfx

creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:34:58 and this runs 1k block planes below max thruster speed without fps going below 60
creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:35:33 yes but pcs aint too cheap but they arent overpriced like ur laptop
creations-chat 2020-09-29 01:36:04 its $$$-performance ratio

plane-crazy 2020-09-30 14:51:48 <@!464629635108306953> regarding the plane shaking suggestion

its called "aerodynamics"

If your plane go too fast then its gonna start to shake irl too
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 14:52:14 add more weight and wing surface, make the plane bigger in general
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 23:34:51 fear the bong 747
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 23:35:40 also dont use roblox record the frame rate is like 5 and the resoultion is like 144p
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 23:35:49 use obs
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 23:36:20 well

creations-chat 2020-10-08 23:35:28 <@!666023552654377012> make the nose more like a plane nose and not a half sphere with a window cut onto it

creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:59:04 i mean remove their posting perms not make it invisible
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:59:21 read it again
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:59:47 bots that remove their reactions exist
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:00:17 not really
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:00:33 takes like 5-10 minutes to do
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:01:39 ok ok fam any reasoning behind that
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:02:12 same thing happens to suggestions
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:02:36 its not that complicated
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:02:53 then ping everyone in announcements
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:03:18 not like it doesnt happen smh
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:03:46 because some noobs post lower quality creations that clutter up the channel and sometimes make high quality things get pushed out
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:04:50 not that
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:05:29 some people also ignore the higher ones and they look at the like first or second creation
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:06:09 then what? have a bot put 10+ upvote creations in a separate channel?
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:06:25 yea
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:06:42 but i aint scrolling for 30 mins a day i dont have the time
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:07:00 also discord only pushes you so far to the top
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:07:16 then how do i look at each of em carefully and analyze
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:08:28 <@456226577798135808> any, they all are kinda metas but are all fun to build
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:08:54 u know how young i was when i made an account that came up with the name
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:09:12 and i got stupid last year and copied the username with a 2
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:10:17 i would have picked a better name if i had the robux to change it
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:10:34 i was like 9
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:10:50 and changing username is fucked up expensive
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:11:16 like holy shit im not paying like 30 bucks irl to change a name
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:12:18 make it like free to change username once a year
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:12:35 and have it cost robux within 1 year
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:13:44 because ive had my account for 2 years rn and 1 year ago id likely come up with a cringe username like "aw_man12145215"
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:14:21 they profit the most from gamepasses and shop anyway
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:15:00 cus roblox is a jerk and snatches 90% profit
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:15:40 i dont remember actually
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:15:56 but gamepasses are 90% i think
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:16:29 it still is in good games
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:16:49 cus PtW games never get too popular
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:17:04 arsenal
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:17:31 arsenal is the most non-ptw able game cus you cant buy weapons

creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:21:44 the issue is that the /servers *servers* never get much attention and not enough players

creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:23:17 still i just pull out the bugs and camp the annoying max pvp weapon turret cars til they stop/quit

creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:40:17 it aint perfect but it makes it better
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:55:22 "i dont want to have an accidental pregancy, ill cut my *anatomical object* off"

plane-crazy 2020-10-20 18:32:24 EMERGENCY MEETING
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 18:34:46 ur data is not gone, its that the datastores couldnt retrieve the data
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 18:35:47 so basically you cant load any data until its fixed, your data is unaffected tho
bug-reports 2020-10-21 12:33:55 Due to Ping/client-side lag, if you attempt to damage someone in PVP with weapons (especially guns) the model appears to "freeze" in midair, but the creation itself is completely fine on their screens. I believe this is because when you hit someone on your screen, due to ping you may not be actually hitting their actual position that the server renders and thus bugs out.
bug-reports 2020-10-21 13:31:45 sometimes its the entire model
bug-reports 2020-10-21 13:32:08 and you have like 2 tiny bits of where their creation actually is that you have to shoot at to damage them further
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 14:01:40 planes stalling if your angle of attack is too high when
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:15:58 boing 767 wip

creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:18:02 actual seats in 1st class so ppl can still sit
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:22:45 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145> based on rick's speed at adding updates that aint never gonna happen
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:23:58 destructible bridge with reset button pls we neeeeed it

the-dump 2021-03-08 18:07:02 i think playing roblox from mars has less ping than this
bug-reports 2021-03-09 13:09:18 Blowing up something/resetting while in water sometimes freezes your game. I don’t notice anything to do with how large the creation is, it just freezes.
bug-reports 2021-03-09 14:16:44 Naaa I get 60fps and suddenly it freezes
bug-reports 2021-03-09 14:17:30 I can run X-Plane 11 at almost full graphics so don’t throw at me that excuse
bug-reports 2021-03-09 14:26:52 I spawn in water, rp crashing into it and blow up tnt, no issues, and like 5 seconds later bam it freezes

bot-central 2022-01-18 22:09:56 i am
general 2022-03-28 23:31:52 is that 16x more area or 16x more length/width
general 2022-03-28 23:32:03 thats weak
general 2022-03-28 23:32:11 so 4x as much length
general 2022-03-28 23:32:30 but still would be fun for dogfights
general 2022-03-28 23:32:44 so the enemy doesnt coward out and start climbing to outer space
general 2022-03-28 23:35:04 and this would mean that normal propeller engines will not be able to compete at all with jet engines or rocket engines tho
general 2022-03-28 23:35:39 maybe lets say that propeller engines lose thrust more slowly but have a very sharp dropoff near the max altitude
general 2022-03-28 23:36:50 pfffff
general 2022-03-28 23:37:02 imagine not chocolate flavore- wait is that chocolate?
general 2022-03-28 23:37:55 uhh
general 2022-03-28 23:38:08 you make the rear wheel have twice as much horsepower
general 2022-03-28 23:38:15 but you make the front wheels spin freely
general 2022-03-28 23:38:29 if you set the torque to 0 it will
general 2022-03-28 23:38:40 if youre using the prebuilt wheel then boohoo
general 2022-03-28 23:38:51 or do that yeah
general 2022-03-28 23:39:05 not sure for prebuilt wheel
general 2022-03-28 23:39:07 never used it much
general 2022-03-28 23:39:38 elaborate
general 2022-03-28 23:51:15 the tldr is for the imag
general 2022-03-28 23:51:17 image
general 2022-03-28 23:51:35 ik
general 2022-03-28 23:51:51 some stuff on the image might take some effort to read
general 2022-03-28 23:55:04 
general 2022-03-29 00:06:07 wdym
general 2022-03-29 00:06:23 the point where it becomes significant is around 15000 altitude
general 2022-03-29 00:06:34 way more than the space needed for dogfights
general 2022-03-29 00:06:53 theyre revamping jet engines
general 2022-03-29 00:06:57 or i hope they are
general 2022-03-29 00:07:36 so hopefully they will actually produce more thrust than their own weight

creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:06:46 what about it
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:09:01 yum
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:11:21 i didnt want to spend 15 hours on making the nose, i have a life
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:16:53 it looks close enough to the real klm 747
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:24:32 Another main reason is that I had to make a mechanism to let the nose open up, that took a bunch of space, also half triangle wedge block would solve half the blocky bits in this aircraft
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:49:12 two things about what you said:

one, what the hell am i supposed to do about the klm markings? blocks are too low-res for that to work

two, this comment wasnt exactly constructive towards improving my creation, anyone with minimal knowledge towards a 747 can tell that it is clearly a cargo variant
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:51:43 ok cool, explain how it is a hot dog and how i can improve it please
