The Tale of deepfriedmemes (688802072048566302)
general 2022-12-12 01:41:48 I’m gonna be honest
general 2022-12-12 01:41:55 build a boat for treasure is a better game
general 2022-12-12 01:43:45 it’s true
general 2022-12-12 01:44:20 build a boat you can do anything in plane crazy with better details
general 2022-12-12 01:44:38 no 💀
general 2022-12-12 01:45:15 I mean the results speak for themselves
general 2022-12-12 01:45:24 I do
general 2022-12-12 01:45:35 I’ve made detailed builds
general 2022-12-12 01:49:47 It literally can
general 2022-12-12 01:51:02 yeh fr
general 2022-12-12 01:51:28 you can use an AFK grinder and just leave your pc on for a day and have enoigh
general 2022-12-12 01:51:39 1 week
general 2022-12-12 01:51:50 3 days if you use the clone tool
general 2022-12-12 01:51:58 do quests
general 2022-12-12 01:52:25 okay but
general 2022-12-12 01:52:37 If you have resources in babft you can make some crazy good stuff
general 2022-12-12 01:52:44 more diverse than anything in plane crazy
general 2022-12-12 01:53:03 the blocks and rotation tools
general 2022-12-12 01:53:22 you can make a huge race track in babft
general 2022-12-12 01:53:44 you can’t do that in plane crazy in pc either
general 2022-12-12 01:54:10 bro have you seen racetracks in babft
general 2022-12-12 01:54:16 💀 because it is
general 2022-12-12 01:54:36 how
general 2022-12-12 01:54:44 I get that your better in physics and gamepassss
general 2022-12-12 01:55:52 physics are better
general 2022-12-12 01:56:02 but if you want to make something that looks good babft is superior
general 2022-12-12 01:56:10 For plane crazy I meant
general 2022-12-12 01:56:20 obviously plane crazy physics are better
general 2022-12-12 01:56:28 they look horrible compared to the babft stuff
general 2022-12-12 01:57:09 no I literally made a nice looking car in 3 days
general 2022-12-12 01:57:12 not that hard
general 2022-12-12 01:57:43 the stuff In creations looks medicore compared to the microblock stuff I see in babft
general 2022-12-12 01:57:58 With the new clone tool you can make detailed things really fast
general 2022-12-12 01:58:26 send me some good ones
general 2022-12-12 01:59:00 They banned me because I made 9/11 in babft and posted it in their creations channel 😭
general 2022-12-12 02:00:17 those are great planes I’ll give you that
general 2022-12-12 02:00:29 but babft is still better in terms of fighter jet design
general 2022-12-12 02:00:36 some of those jets are really good
general 2022-12-12 02:00:52 I hate the babft mods
general 2022-12-12 02:01:37 legalise nuclear bombs
general 2022-12-12 02:01:46 this song goes so fire it’s a warcrime 💥💥💥
general 2022-12-12 02:01:59 they banned me because I said kamikaze💀
general 2022-12-12 02:02:13 I said design
general 2022-12-12 02:02:25 Plane crazy has amazing physics compared to babft
general 2022-12-12 02:02:48 but it looks so good
general 2022-12-12 02:03:05 anime pfp
general 2022-12-12 02:03:19 white is the superior color
general 2022-12-12 02:03:31 😈
general 2022-12-12 02:03:54 pov people when you like a specific color
general 2022-12-12 02:04:31 plane crazy is miles ahead in terms of usability and physics
general 2022-12-12 02:04:41 babft just wins in design quality
general 2022-12-12 02:04:45 I’ve seen better
general 2022-12-12 02:04:49 I can send them to you
general 2022-12-12 02:06:38 I already told you that it was
general 2022-12-12 02:07:12 use sand
general 2022-12-12 02:07:22 I agree I hate the IRS
general 2022-12-12 02:07:37 You can fly it, just nit as good at babft
general 2022-12-12 02:08:05 no
general 2022-12-12 02:08:17 you can do barrel rolls easy with mechanics
general 2022-12-12 02:08:47 you just have to create a complicated 30 part system to make it turn 5 degrees to the side
general 2022-12-12 02:08:55 we fixed the engine issue
general 2022-12-12 02:09:13 the jets now are using magnets propulsion
general 2022-12-12 02:09:44 so basically have you seen the meme with a magnet infront of a truck saying that the magnet will pull the truck forward because it’s metal?
general 2022-12-12 02:09:50 that works in babft
general 2022-12-12 02:09:53 the physics are bad I know
general 2022-12-12 02:10:07 wdym magnets can literally fly forever permanently in babft
general 2022-12-12 02:12:39 Magnets work different
general 2022-12-12 02:13:01 in babft we use hybrid systems using thrusters, magnets and jets to control speed
general 2022-12-12 02:13:18 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:13:24 water jet engine tech
general 2022-12-12 02:14:23 What the hell 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:15:14 okay even if babft loses In terms of planes we still atleast have better boats and cars
general 2022-12-12 02:15:32 we have better trains as well
general 2022-12-12 02:15:58 there’s a group in babft that has these elaborate naval battles on a huge sea field
general 2022-12-12 02:16:49 I’m not gonna fight you, I’m just gonna send you some of the babft trains and you tell me if their better
general 2022-12-12 02:17:27 You design your own
general 2022-12-12 02:17:54 easy
general 2022-12-12 02:18:04 you can do that too
general 2022-12-12 02:18:17 just use a servo motor and the clone tool
general 2022-12-12 02:18:22 and you can make any track you want
general 2022-12-12 02:18:31 More like 10 minutes
general 2022-12-12 02:18:47 damn that’s cool
general 2022-12-12 02:18:59 easy
general 2022-12-12 02:19:02 hinge blocks
general 2022-12-12 02:19:23 Dynamite block
general 2022-12-12 02:20:33 ZAMN
general 2022-12-12 02:22:00 In babft you can make huge runways by building them sideways against the plot
general 2022-12-12 02:22:10 then putting them down by using a cake block and seat
general 2022-12-12 02:22:26 but the plane crazy runways still look great
general 2022-12-12 02:22:35 just place them above
general 2022-12-12 02:23:32 I agree
general 2022-12-12 02:23:37 but
general 2022-12-12 02:23:43 kerbal space program is better
general 2022-12-12 02:24:02 cant wait for kerbal space program 2
general 2022-12-12 02:24:06 I don’t care if it’s 50 usd

general 2022-12-12 02:44:49 you can’t scale the blocks smaller
general 2022-12-12 02:44:52 so it’s impossible
general 2022-12-12 02:45:16 okay

general 2022-12-12 02:48:30 the parts are blocky and there’s a lot of visible part clipping
general 2022-12-12 02:49:06 There is
general 2022-12-12 02:49:31 look at the TAIL
general 2022-12-12 02:49:38 DO YOU SEE THE PART CLIPPING
general 2022-12-12 02:50:03 no no
general 2022-12-12 02:50:07 the signs
general 2022-12-12 02:50:10 they’re uneven

general 2022-12-12 02:51:06 BRO THATS HUGE
general 2022-12-12 02:52:19 You picked the worst example
general 2022-12-12 02:52:32 Your picking the worst example
general 2022-12-12 02:54:40 The body is glass 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:56:00 Elon is currently leveraging the entire US space agency 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:56:40 I like Elon musk cause he’s making 9 year old kids from yemen mine lithium
general 2022-12-12 02:57:50 the fact is NASA can’t delivery astronauts to the ISS so they contract space x to do it
general 2022-12-12 02:58:22 yeah 50 year ago
general 2022-12-12 02:58:30 what have they done now 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:58:56 50 years ago
general 2022-12-12 02:59:03 when they had more budget than the millitary
general 2022-12-12 02:59:36 no they ain’t 💀
general 2022-12-12 02:59:50 unmanned mission
general 2022-12-12 03:00:05 you gotta wait atleast 2 more years for a manned moon landing
general 2022-12-12 03:00:20 that’s actually a W

general 2022-12-12 03:06:32 https://youtu.be/99CReCoys7E
general 2022-12-12 03:08:34 babft pvp is better
general 2022-12-12 03:08:37 mech battles
general 2022-12-12 03:09:24 the babft mechs are way better
general 2022-12-12 03:09:29 yeah
general 2022-12-12 03:10:16 https://youtu.be/3cb_k-j_NTI
general 2022-12-12 03:11:04 the babft mechs require like 30 different keybinds so I get it
general 2022-12-12 03:15:10 babft has better car<:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2022-12-12 03:15:28 cars
general 2022-12-12 03:16:34 let me send you something
general 2022-12-12 03:17:12 it isn’t really fun anymore
general 2022-12-12 03:17:28 there are these elaborate flinging contraptions that just send you 10,000 blocks away
general 2022-12-12 03:17:51 I hate the babft mods
general 2022-12-12 03:19:18 the air combat is quite goofy, everyone has planes that teleport like thousands of miles away and the fighters spent like 30 minutes tracking each other down
general 2022-12-12 03:19:57 I like it because the building is better
general 2022-12-12 03:20:01 there are missikes
general 2022-12-12 03:23:08 I literally sent a video of it

general 2022-12-12 03:31:28 You didn’t know?
general 2022-12-12 03:31:43 Blue arrows and everyone else now use magnet hybrid engines
general 2022-12-12 03:32:52 so because your cars are more unnecessarily complicated they’re better?
general 2022-12-12 03:33:24 no
general 2022-12-12 03:33:42 cars in a game about boats
general 2022-12-12 03:33:51 Speed mechanic and ground effect magnets
general 2022-12-12 03:34:14 Add all of that and you have a huge abomination car
general 2022-12-12 03:34:30 yes
general 2022-12-12 03:34:33 it literally does
