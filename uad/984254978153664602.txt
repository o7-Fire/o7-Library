general 2022-12-11 09:51:20 Uhh
general 2022-12-11 09:56:47 Everytime i play on pvp,it crash the game every hit i get
general 2022-12-11 09:56:51 Why
general 2022-12-11 09:57:14 Im on mobile
general 2022-12-11 09:57:28 I use like motor lock
general 2022-12-11 09:58:03 Probably,but it does on other phone
general 2022-12-11 09:59:26 I had like scripting experience,im pretty sure it has to do with "transparent" tweening,everytime a part gets destroyed.
Im probably wrong
general 2022-12-11 10:00:44 Im pretty sure tweening with transparency wouldn't cause a problem on performance?
general 2022-12-11 10:01:22 Thousands of PARTS tweens transparency
