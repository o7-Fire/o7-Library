general 2021-01-01 21:39:32 I never get 60 fps even on minimum graphics
help 2021-02-16 18:23:56 Can someone help me with my XV-40? I don’t currently have a picture but I can get on soon. It can’t stay upright well and now it just glitches and gets flinging when I try to fly it
help 2021-02-16 18:24:28 Please ping me if you can help, I’m going to go offline for a few minutes to eat.
help 2021-02-16 18:35:01 It’s gonna be a while until I get on actually but could you give suggestions without seeing it?
help 2021-02-16 18:35:14 Actually I could join on mobile and get some pics

help 2021-02-16 18:42:54 I’m trying to make it as similar to the XV-40 as possible
help 2021-02-16 18:43:32 I recently put helium on the top and ballast blocks on the bottom to try to give it better balance
help 2021-02-16 18:43:51 But the main problem is that it glitches

help 2021-02-16 18:47:56 I’m bad at building
help 2021-02-16 18:48:03 And it’s not done
help 2021-02-16 18:48:47 And I’m not talking about the car
help 2021-02-16 18:49:13 It’s supposed to be the XV-40 Experimental VTOL
help 2021-02-16 18:50:03 The car
help 2021-02-16 18:52:59 There is a Toyota xv40 car and a VTOL XV-40
help 2021-02-16 18:53:16 How...
help 2021-02-16 18:54:43 Why does this matter I’m just trying to stop my VTOL from getting flung
help 2021-02-16 18:55:28 Yes I’m well aware
help 2021-02-16 18:55:58 Because you said xv40, which is a car and you said that I wasn’t building it when I made a VTOL
help 2021-02-16 18:56:17 Either way, can someone actually help me
help 2021-02-16 18:56:56 I attempted to recreate the XV-40 Experimental VTOL, I’m sorry if it’s not perfect
help 2021-02-16 18:58:31 Anyways, can someone help me stop this from happening
