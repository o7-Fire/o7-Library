general 2020-12-06 16:04:52 a heli can't
general 2020-12-06 16:07:00 you can't just say "fail"  there are lot sof different problems that could occur

general 2020-12-19 21:21:50 what a sad track
general 2020-12-19 21:25:57 isn't it too big for a plane game?
general 2020-12-19 21:27:20 too big
general 2020-12-19 21:27:48 you didn't consider the lag
general 2020-12-19 21:27:55 that's the main problem
general 2020-12-19 21:28:30 is the guard rail a mesh?
general 2020-12-19 21:28:45 hmm
general 2020-12-19 21:29:56 to me it looks too complex for plane crazy style
general 2020-12-19 21:30:35 in an empty map it doesn't lag
general 2020-12-19 21:32:00 but if you put the players and their creations, be sure that it will decrease the performance a lot
general 2020-12-19 21:33:02 if the map isn't optimised there is no point
general 2020-12-19 21:34:06 only the guard rails have more parts than the whole current map
general 2020-12-19 21:38:15 i can see noobs with their 4$ laptop disliking the game for the lag
general 2020-12-19 21:39:06 how
general 2020-12-19 21:39:38 that's just an animarion
general 2020-12-19 21:40:01 i know
general 2020-12-19 21:40:42 but if you keep that level of detail it will become too much for a lot of crappy laptops out there
general 2020-12-19 21:42:13 if half of the players lags and leaves the game it's a failure
general 2020-12-19 21:43:08 and they have a trash pc
general 2020-12-19 21:43:20 if they lag they won't play the game anymore
general 2020-12-19 21:43:30 no players= no moneys
general 2020-12-19 21:43:45 no moneys = failure
general 2020-12-19 21:43:56 that's not about how many moneys they have

creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:26:42 those shaders make every detail more visible, so if the build sucks it actually sucks more with the shaders because you can see every little imperfection better, (that's not the case here)
What i'm saying is that he posted a picture with the shaders to show better the details of his build. (entering a <#504436696021204992> discussion, worst error of my life)

plane-crazy 2022-08-16 19:30:32 and then they just changed the engine placement

the-dump 2022-12-14 17:00:38 i think blender is already advanced enough, it's for sure a complete software
the-dump 2022-12-14 17:05:15 i hate roblox studio with a passion, it's so bugged and lacks many features, but it's fine if you just want to have fun for a couple of hours
the-dump 2022-12-14 17:06:49 lol
