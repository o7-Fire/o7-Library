general 2022-03-29 16:03:27 quick question does anyone know how i can find things like trajectory because it would help if i knew where i was going at high speeds
general 2022-03-29 16:04:34 i kinda want to know how to find extra information without using scripts
general 2022-03-29 16:04:41 its too risky
general 2022-03-29 16:05:03 not speed i mean like flight path
general 2022-03-29 16:05:25 as in a line that shows where you would land for example a plane
general 2022-03-29 16:06:35 o
