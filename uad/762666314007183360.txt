general 2021-01-21 23:49:31 it can carry all their loads, and it can do everything all of them can do even better
general 2021-01-21 23:50:05 the SU-57 can reach supersonic speeds without afterburner
general 2021-01-21 23:51:06 Wrong, the SU-57 is older then the F-22 due to its older model, the SU-52 and SU-50
general 2021-01-21 23:51:22 Just a shit load more advanced then the SU-52
