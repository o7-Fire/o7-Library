the-dump 2022-06-23 09:15:46 ofc there was
the-dump 2022-06-23 09:16:10 during the polish occupation in ww2 there were propaganda posters motivating the people of warsaw against goebbels propaganda
the-dump 2022-06-23 09:16:49 these posters are talked about in the book on historical events called "kamienie na szaniec" wich tells real story of the polish youth
the-dump 2022-06-23 09:29:07 its just that you think all propaganda is negative, its not like that, every country at some point produced propaganda
the-dump 2022-06-23 09:32:30 this is more of a historical debate then political honestly
