The AC-37 "Combatant"
Large flying air cruiser with 12 rockets and 10 guns, it is used mainly to attack ships, ground targets, and large aircraft, as it is not well suited for combat with fighters, which is why it is mainly escorted by fighters.

general 2019-06-09 23:58:10 ***bad things happen***
general 2019-06-10 17:18:16 i see nothing wrong with this image

general 2019-06-10 17:42:21 bad
general 2019-06-10 19:05:08 got done testing this
general 2019-06-10 19:05:53 its capable of launching large satellites into orbit around the sun if you use all the fuel available
general 2019-06-10 19:06:24 if you want to you can use about only some of the fuel and get one around kerbin
general 2019-06-10 19:06:44 or if your crazy wait forever with time sped up and get it into orbit around the mun
general 2019-06-10 19:36:17 rip
general 2019-06-10 19:36:25 i make spaceplanes alot
general 2019-06-10 19:36:45 ooooooffff

general 2019-06-10 19:38:44 that looks neat
general 2019-06-10 19:39:04 but i teleported it near the sun
general 2019-06-10 19:39:16 and went towards it
general 2019-06-10 19:39:20 kerbal went pop
general 2019-06-10 19:39:59 sometimes i just turn off gravity and fuel to make weird/cool looking planes and just fly around
general 2019-06-10 19:41:32 rockets and spaceplanes are inferior
general 2019-06-10 19:41:40 icbms are best
general 2019-06-10 19:41:41 lmao
general 2019-06-10 19:41:56 too bad i cant make them explode like a nuke

general 2019-06-13 02:20:07 guys
general 2019-06-13 02:20:12 i made a mass of wings
general 2019-06-13 02:20:15 and started spinning
general 2019-06-13 02:20:17 very fast
general 2019-06-13 02:20:22 and then i went 4x speed
general 2019-06-13 02:20:37 and then i went to around 2 quintillion m/s
general 2019-06-13 02:20:42 and looked on the map
general 2019-06-13 02:21:20 and the ship icon started shaking violently before shaking so much it was teleporting all over the screen
general 2019-06-13 02:21:25 then all the planets went poof
general 2019-06-13 02:21:29 and then the game closed

general 2019-06-13 02:21:44 i think i made the space kraken eat the universe
general 2019-06-18 17:02:52 who needs math
general 2019-06-18 17:03:19 just go strait up until you get orbit and turn the thrusters off
general 2019-06-18 17:03:24 ***do not attempt***
general 2019-06-29 18:20:17 ok so here is what you do
general 2019-06-29 18:20:21 ok

general 2019-06-29 18:20:36 and click 'terminate'
general 2019-06-29 18:20:47 it will double your science and give you free vbucks
general 2019-06-29 18:26:50 im going to post a tutorial on how to make a warp drive
general 2019-06-29 18:27:31 he will die
general 2019-06-29 18:27:34 ive tried
general 2019-06-29 18:28:01 he explodes leaving the atmosphere
general 2019-06-29 18:28:16 he cant take the heat
general 2019-06-29 18:39:03 ```How to make a WTF Drive‚Ñ¢```

**Step one: Get an MK1 cockpit (make sure you are in the VAB

Step  two: Activate Inf fuel, unbreakable joint, and no collision damage

Step three: Make a le epic bayblade pattern with wing panels around the cockpit

Step four: Spam thrusters on the wing panels sideways so that when activated make the craft spin (the more the better) (make sure they are radial)

Step five: Put a strong thruster on the bottom of the cockpit to push the craft up

Step six: Launch

Step seven: Activate all thusters at full power

Step eight: Confirm you are spinning and wobbling like crazy and going up.

Step nine: set to 4x speed

Step ten: Your craft should stretch out all over the place, before teleporting out of Kerbin. Set the speed to 1x at this point and open the map.**

```Now that the WTF Drive‚Ñ¢ has been activated, one of two thing will happen:```

*All planets will dissapear and the craft icon will begin shaking violently before teleporting all over the screen, followed by a game crash.*

*Or, the drive will not fail, and this will happen: the same as above will happen, but instead of crashing, the craft will be teleported out of existance and the speedometer should read "NaN m/s"*

(Note that attempting to revert or go back to the tracking station or KSC will instantly crash the game)

```Thank you for reading, and hope that your WTF Drive‚Ñ¢ Worked!```
