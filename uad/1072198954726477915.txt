general 2023-02-26 02:45:32 I never really appealed the account
general 2023-02-26 02:47:30 Actually if you use the equation 3.14159xr^2 you will get the area of the circle and measuring the diameter to your profile picture on to the remaining pixels you couldve used, you used around half of the circle when counting the amount of pixels that are vivid and not blending in with the discord background -ü§ì
general 2023-02-26 02:47:47 Ok üëç
general 2023-02-26 02:48:13 My ping is reaching 200-500 in priv server lol
general 2023-02-26 02:50:02 But you also have to count the individual pixels in the screen which will not always be proportionate to the numerals of pi -ü§ì
general 2023-02-26 02:52:10 But you also have to count the amount of rendering your monitor has and how many pixels it can make, this can make your guess off by a few pixels therefore you would have to rely on the power of your computer/phone to have enough power to display a certain amount of pixels to get a correct calculation ü§ì
general 2023-02-26 02:53:22 My helicopter being an ass rn and not wanting to load

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:37:35 But then it wouldnt work as a joystick
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:37:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:37:42 Just a mouse but looking different
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:39 Wasd controls for joystick would worki a lot better
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:46 Because it works like a joystick
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:56 Instead of a cursor on the screen being moved by a joystick
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:39:44 Imagine not doing a 180 degree snap with m2m
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:42:49 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:42:51 Didnt know
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:42:59 Thought it was just moving cursor with joystick

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:34:44 The motor 2 on my pvp jet just freezes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:34:49 But unfreezes with im anchored
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:34:52 Like wtf
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:43:27 Motor 2 effecting all my m2m jets and helicopters
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:13:58 All jets are fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:01 All m2m
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:04 All roscale
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:06 All fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:24 The motor 2 itself is broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:28 Toggle and servo is aswell
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:32 You cant even use wasd
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:14:52 its broken for me
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:15:12 Motor 2's just lock up at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:15:24 They try to fix motor 2 mouse glitching out just by locking it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:15:29 Now control surfaces are gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:04 It also accounts to people using motor 2 for helicopter rotors that use powered motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:08 Or blade flap
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:14 It also fucks up the heli community
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:59 If they use motor 2 for swashplate or motor 2 for blade flap, it breaks
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:01 The thing falls
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:04 To the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:30 Usually if the rotor is powered, people use motor 2's
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:37 For flight setting and control
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:40 But thats gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:58 I see m2m jets falling out of the sky in my pvp server üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:18:40 Istg someone needs to fix this shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:18:46 Pvp is crumbling
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:18:47 Hard
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:19:01 anything with motor 2 is gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:19:21 The ground community thrives while the sky community parishes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:19:37 Nerfed like 90% of the jets hard
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:19:50 The funny part is that my attack su25 plane still works
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:19:52 Perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:20:06 It doesnt use motor 2 mouse
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:20:10 It uses control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:20:25 
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:20:41 Why would I do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:20:53 Ye they didnt like the lack of custom angles
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:21:10 At least m2m jets cant hunt down my attack aircraft

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:22:23 Motor 2 got nerfed and locks up all the time
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:22:28 All m2m jets broke
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:22:35 90% of airforce is gone

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:19 Any few surviving planes are now the best pvp aircraft in the game
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:47 I think they tried to patch motor 2's flinging people, so they made them lock up at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:49 Poor choice
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:24 They all gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:32 Any pvp aircraft is now gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:49 Except for tut planes and attack
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:14 Not the last part
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:30 Motor 2's at high speed break
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:35 Not on ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:21 If they dont fix this glitch
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:26 Plane crazy is going to die
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:36 Like 2k player count bouta be 500

plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:04:20 Wait i dont see it anymore
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:04:48 I did
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:04:58 I still dont kinda see it
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:06:00 Its because the vertical stabilizers motors covers up a good portion of it so you dont see the full thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:06:21 The distance between the furthest part of the main with and the furthest part of the elevators seem fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:06:30 Ye

plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:06:55 Those are two delta 1x1's
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:06:58 Its a mini build
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:07:15 Making it a block longer would destroy all the proportions
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:07:22 Shhh its pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:07:50 Its because the front is coved by vertical stabilizer motor
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:07:58 Lemme get a shot without vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:08:06 Nah
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:09:17 Vertical stabilizer also acts as a blocker for engine tilt
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:09:20 Wait
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:11:21 
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:11:31 
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:11:48 The angle needs to be longer for it to be more forward
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 01:11:59 <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:11:47 No offense to the front
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:11:49 It looks fine
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:12:11 I just found it kinda funny how the back is extremely round and detailed and the front has a blocky canopy lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:13:40 Every namnam jet ever:
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:13:44 Oh wait

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:16:01 Making more roscalish builds and whatnot
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:16:38 Except the f4 actually flies like a brick
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:17:07 Vietnams migs were better lol

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:25:08 Im your local whitename
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:25:19 Tech junkie whitename
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:25:20 (Real)
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:26:00 Roshade ass su35
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:26:18 I took that picture like 2 months ago
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:26:20 Maybe 3
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:26:23 Idk anymore
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:28:18 Lets see
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:28:25 I have my seahawk without shadres
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:28:29 But thats no fun
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:28:47 Its like I dont really use shaders much
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:04 Shoulve used them more before roblox threatened to hardware ban them
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:18 I have uh
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:20 mtd
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:25 But no core
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:35 I should just make it ano-core
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:38 Should be easy
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:42 Except for welding
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:29:44 Gonna make me cry
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:30:26 I think I tried welding my mig
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:30:31 It didnt go so well
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:30:48 It was so bad that motors just stopped working even after core tech was disconnected
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:30:50 Makes me cry
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:31:30 Did you just not use motorlock lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:31:43 The main issue is the plane itself
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:31:49 If you saw the side view you would vomit
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:32:29 Or just connect it with every other part
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:32:35 But welding seems simpler idk
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:32:57 The weight reduction is nice and it fixed my hover thruster glitch
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:33:12 Ill see what I can do with it in the future to fix the broken motorlock it causes for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:33:44 I should port my old builds
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:33:52 Like 1 year old builds from last summer
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:34:03 Like this abomination
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:34:12 Lemme find reference image
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:34:15 Cause the model is shit
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:34:30 
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:34:41 I couldve made it better
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:11 Is it because its annoying when its effective against you or is it because its annoying to use?
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:46 It crashed
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:51 Or did it lag you out
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:57 Oh shit im dumb
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:59 I meant fling
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:36:17 Sometimes its good when you dont wanna overshoot lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:36:25 But in close quarters its so ass
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:36:57 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:37:03 Im guessing it was shaking a lot
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:37:13 Just like my atr72 I could never finish
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:37:23 Still angry roblox made an update that never allows me to load it again
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:37:56 Ofc ofc
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:38:00 And the rockets will be offset
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:38:11 Because the game hates you and likes bothering your ocd
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:38:27 They client crash me üò≠
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:39:26 Because it always says something about outside clients and the roblox clients blablabla we kicked you from the experience
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:39:49 I lag so badly that it thinks im using an external client to lag the game
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:40:40 Anything I click is delayed for 2 minutes before the game crashes
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:40:54 Because of the intense lag spike
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:41:04 That sometimes happens too
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:42:27 Someone rate my pvp build (Yes I put 12 missiles under the wings)
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:43:02 I can play dcs missions with 60 fps lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:43:22 Oh lord

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:46:26 They copied EVERYTHING

general 2023-05-10 20:36:35 I got core now so am happi
general 2023-05-10 20:36:40 All worked out in the end
general 2023-05-10 20:37:24 Public pvp dominance
general 2023-05-10 20:38:08 Talk about overkill
general 2023-05-10 20:39:01 The more I talk about tech, the more I get pvp sucks
general 2023-05-10 20:39:07 I'm going back the gnc smh

general 2023-05-10 20:47:33 I love the ones where people accidentally add 4 blades on them
general 2023-05-10 20:48:04 They didn't like me there so I left
general 2023-05-10 20:48:32 I did but just left on.my own accord
general 2023-05-10 20:48:43 Didn't see myself necessary there
general 2023-05-10 20:50:16 Firework macros are the best shows
general 2023-05-10 20:50:23 Always so satisfying
general 2023-05-10 20:51:16 I smell spinny magnet

general 2023-05-10 21:44:58 The apes fucked the shark
general 2023-05-10 21:45:09 Thats what they tell you
general 2023-05-10 21:45:30 It wasn't consentual
general 2023-05-10 21:45:32 Maybe
general 2023-05-10 21:47:14 It doesn't get better
general 2023-05-11 20:19:21 Let's see what horrors are happening in pcc general
general 2023-05-11 20:20:28 Could be worse
general 2023-05-14 01:47:34 <@573970670854340628> Is there any way I can get in touch with an admin in plane crazy to ban a guy?
general 2023-05-14 01:47:39 I know reports are closed
general 2023-05-14 01:47:50 But some guy keeps using rotrack to join my servers
general 2023-05-14 01:47:55 And spam PCA tech to destroy em
general 2023-05-14 01:48:00 I litterally can't plauy plane crazy public
general 2023-05-14 01:48:02 At all
general 2023-05-14 01:48:05 Alr
general 2023-05-14 01:48:19 Got on a bad hitlist
general 2023-05-14 01:48:46 Hes destroying the entire server
general 2023-05-14 01:48:51 Like breaking the code lines with tech
general 2023-05-14 01:48:55 Cant save or load builds
general 2023-05-14 01:48:57 Everyone leaves
general 2023-05-14 01:49:02 I am
general 2023-05-14 01:49:05 I need to find ss
general 2023-05-14 01:49:08 I have multiple
general 2023-05-14 01:59:57 Its quite obvious
general 2023-05-14 02:03:01 No
general 2023-05-14 02:03:10 Its been happening to an entire tech group im in
general 2023-05-14 02:03:14 We didnt do anything bad
general 2023-05-14 02:03:18 Someone just doesnt like tech
general 2023-05-14 02:03:33 Nah
general 2023-05-14 02:03:53 The tech hes using destroys all the scripts plane crazy uses
general 2023-05-14 02:03:57 Including loading and saving builds
general 2023-05-14 02:04:03 etc
general 2023-05-14 02:04:03 And ragdolling
general 2023-05-14 02:04:14 He leaves and leaves the entire server in shambles
general 2023-05-14 02:04:21 Unplayable
general 2023-05-14 02:04:33 A certain type of tech
general 2023-05-14 02:04:37 Really game breaking
general 2023-05-14 02:04:38 And simple
general 2023-05-14 02:04:46 Well sadly it exists
general 2023-05-14 02:04:50 And it fucks up the server
general 2023-05-14 02:04:52 Entirely
general 2023-05-14 02:05:28 It also happened in some of the private servers of the top political figures in the tech group
general 2023-05-14 02:05:42 Which means hes grabbing server link codes and blowing up events
general 2023-05-14 02:06:07 I would love a hitlist of people trying to kill me in m2m jets
general 2023-05-14 02:06:10 That would be so fucking fun
general 2023-05-14 02:06:16 But he uses boring server crasher tech smh
general 2023-05-14 02:07:55 the worst part is I can explain how it works in one sentence
general 2023-05-14 02:08:00 Its so incredibly simple
general 2023-05-14 02:08:06 If it was leaked, it would be horribly dramatic
general 2023-05-14 02:08:15 Shit like that is meant to be gatekept
general 2023-05-14 02:08:22 For the sake of plane crazy itself
general 2023-05-14 02:08:52 Why?
general 2023-05-14 02:09:08 Tell me what?
general 2023-05-14 02:09:23 It actually has
general 2023-05-14 02:09:35 But the video has like 20 views
general 2023-05-14 02:09:38 It didnt gain traction
general 2023-05-14 02:09:41 Thankfully
general 2023-05-14 02:10:53 It disables the plane crazy scripts, doesn't use scripts
general 2023-05-14 02:11:01 Basically fucks up the entire server
general 2023-05-14 02:11:09 Leaves everything in shambles
general 2023-05-14 02:11:19 If you spawn in, you just land on the grass
general 2023-05-14 02:11:23 Not at your plot
general 2023-05-14 02:11:27 Because teleport scripts break
general 2023-05-14 02:11:35 usually when it happens people are running to plots
general 2023-05-14 02:11:49 Yeah
general 2023-05-14 02:11:53 But the one he uses is so bad
general 2023-05-14 02:11:59 That it permanently destroys the server
general 2023-05-14 02:12:07 It only recovers like 25% of the time
general 2023-05-14 02:12:15 And thats after like 30 mins
general 2023-05-14 02:12:22 And when it does, he just rejoins and breaks it again
general 2023-05-14 02:12:35 Theres a reason why the tech is gatekept
general 2023-05-14 02:13:08 I explained it to techmaster telling him to send a report for it aswell with the guy hitlist joining me with it
general 2023-05-14 02:13:22 If by some miracle they can add a plugin to fix it
general 2023-05-14 02:13:28 Yep
general 2023-05-14 02:13:34 Takes him 5 minutes to join my pvp server
general 2023-05-14 02:13:36 And he crashes it
general 2023-05-14 02:13:37 Completely
general 2023-05-14 02:13:44 In nonpvp its even less
general 2023-05-14 02:14:05 He cant join the private servers
general 2023-05-14 02:14:07 Only public servers
general 2023-05-14 02:14:09 Sadly
general 2023-05-14 02:14:18 Hes joined some event servers and broke them
general 2023-05-14 02:14:29 They just use the links
general 2023-05-14 02:14:34 I did
general 2023-05-14 02:14:37 I sent a report
general 2023-05-14 02:14:45 It is
general 2023-05-14 02:15:11 Smh
general 2023-05-14 02:15:11 Hes too busy making pc2
general 2023-05-14 02:15:28 It was an alt
general 2023-05-14 02:15:33 hes using an alt to spam join me
general 2023-05-14 02:15:53 His account name is just spammed keyboard characters
general 2023-05-14 02:16:01 Yes
general 2023-05-14 02:16:06 Its a build that does it
general 2023-05-14 02:16:12 Yeah
general 2023-05-14 02:16:16 Thats why its so fucked up
general 2023-05-14 02:16:27 It is
general 2023-05-14 02:16:35 Its happening to like 50 people
general 2023-05-14 02:16:40 Its more of a tech group tho
general 2023-05-14 02:17:14 Considering how fast hes been joining my servers
general 2023-05-14 02:17:20 Hes been doing this since this morning
general 2023-05-14 02:17:29 Like several hours
general 2023-05-14 02:17:35 Its prob script bot
general 2023-05-14 02:17:51 Its just him joining, funky movement stuff, cant use server anymore
general 2023-05-14 02:19:54 I did
general 2023-05-14 02:19:57 To like 5 servers
general 2023-05-14 02:20:05 But I felt bad that im making tons of people lose progress
general 2023-05-14 02:20:10 So I stopped
general 2023-05-14 02:20:19 Because they cant save their builds after it happens
general 2023-05-14 02:20:45 Yeah but it fucks up the community a lot
general 2023-05-14 02:20:52 Id rather file a report and get him banned now
general 2023-05-14 02:20:54 Which I did
general 2023-05-14 02:21:15 yes
general 2023-05-14 02:21:23 Hes been doing it for several hours now
general 2023-05-14 02:21:29 Its prob an ai doing it
general 2023-05-14 02:21:56 Its ok
general 2023-05-14 02:22:04 Ima just take a break while it gets sorted out
general 2023-05-14 02:22:17 Hes only played plane crazy on the alt too
general 2023-05-14 02:22:23 It was made specifically for pissing people off
general 2023-05-14 02:22:30 And denying them access to public servers
general 2023-05-14 02:23:02 Not rn
general 2023-05-14 02:25:50 Its just the server scripts broken
general 2023-05-14 02:25:56 Anything automatic isnt automatic anymore
general 2023-05-14 02:25:58 Buttons break
general 2023-05-14 02:26:02 The server becomes unusable
general 2023-05-14 02:26:06 And people complain in chat
general 2023-05-14 02:26:07 A lot
general 2023-05-14 02:26:10 Ye
general 2023-05-14 02:26:30 75% of the time yes
general 2023-05-14 02:26:34 Sometimes it rolls back
general 2023-05-14 02:26:36 But its rare
general 2023-05-14 02:27:24 yes
general 2023-05-14 02:27:26 Cant play public
general 2023-05-14 02:27:28 At all
general 2023-05-14 02:27:38 because they don like
general 2023-05-14 02:27:45 :<
general 2023-05-14 02:27:53 Im in a tech server
general 2023-05-14 02:27:58 Some guy hates tech
general 2023-05-14 02:28:02 So he stalks me
general 2023-05-14 02:28:04 With server crashers
general 2023-05-14 02:28:08 On alt accounts
general 2023-05-14 02:28:34 Destroys all server scripts
general 2023-05-14 02:28:37 Everything unusable
general 2023-05-14 02:28:53 Some people go a tad bit too far with plane crazy politics
general 2023-05-14 02:29:14 Didnt mean to join you
general 2023-05-14 02:29:17 Whoops
general 2023-05-14 02:29:19 Sorry morfix
general 2023-05-14 02:29:27 I left immediately
general 2023-05-14 02:29:43 Because he might join and try to crash the server
general 2023-05-14 02:29:49 I just clicked the play button
general 2023-05-14 02:29:51 Sorry
general 2023-05-14 02:30:03 I have one too
general 2023-05-14 02:30:12 Im just trying to fix somethin

general 2023-05-14 02:30:49 Ima take a break from plane crazy
general 2023-05-14 02:30:51 I filed a report
general 2023-05-14 02:30:53 With techmaster
general 2023-05-14 02:31:00 He should hopefully get banned
general 2023-05-14 02:31:14 Ive seen it
general 2023-05-14 02:31:36 My friend had scripts so it would teleport to peoples planes
general 2023-05-14 02:31:39 everything explodes
general 2023-05-14 02:31:40 At once
general 2023-05-14 02:31:53 Just a bit of trolling
general 2023-05-14 02:31:56 Nothing that bad
general 2023-05-14 02:32:03 Not as bad as not letting people save builds
general 2023-05-14 02:32:34 It blows em up anyways
general 2023-05-14 02:32:37 Big boom at plot
general 2023-05-14 02:32:50 How tf are you ranked lmao
general 2023-05-14 02:33:08 Oh thats the tip of the iceberg
general 2023-05-14 02:33:18 People take it very seriously
general 2023-05-14 02:33:45 Ikr
general 2023-05-14 02:35:39 I made someone unfriend me because I said they were still a man and not a transgender woman (They had no surgeries or anything, they are fully a boy)
general 2023-05-14 02:36:17 As a gay person, I agree

plane-crazy 2023-07-08 19:34:33 I wonder if core tech will still work after the update
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 19:34:55 Mehh
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:26:06 I went there once
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:26:16 They have cool weather and mountains imo
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:28:10 Does it use locked motors for blade tilt?
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:13 Hmm
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:33 I can actually see it working with proper use
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:39 Kinda
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:45 But then again
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:29:56 You could literally just put a sideways motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:30:04 And add trail details
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:30:14 Whatever floats your boat ig
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:31:58 Gl
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:32:06 I liked the mechanical community
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:32:16 But their stuff is always too big lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:32:36 Mk
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:32:46 You should try learning offset lock for that
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:33:00 Such a good way of compact locking
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:33:12 Oki wait
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:33:23 My ka50 uses triblade
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:33:28 Thats made with offset
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:33:35 Lemme get image rq
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:35:07 Holy shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:35:17 I honestly can't find any images of it on my phone
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:35:35 Just look at namnams rocket pod guide, he uses it
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:35:42 <@907408760253857812>
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:36:06 He used it once
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:36:13 It'll help you understand ig
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:45:08 Helps compact builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:45:16 Forced angle lock kinda
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:45:55 Namnam stole the offset lock rocket pod idea from stuk and made it worse lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:46:59 When you angle lock, the motor unlocks to move, you can force the unlocked motor into a position where it locks back
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:47:44 You use an exterior motor lock tower that disconnects to force it into position
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:48:00 Namnam explains ot better then me smh
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:48:31 Just watch his rocket pod tutorial to understand how it works
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:49:30 You can also use the same method on pvp tanks (how i usually use offset lock) to connect plates with tons of motors, making it extremely hard to sever off
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 20:49:43 Alr
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 21:02:50 Roblox moderation was always...
