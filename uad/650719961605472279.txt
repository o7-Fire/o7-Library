plane-crazy 2020-11-28 09:58:29 Okay guys so I have a F-16 Fighter Jet and it has rockets on its wings, and I am a mobile player and I don't know how to use them, does anyone know how to?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 09:59:32 I need to be in PVP mode right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 09:59:42 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 09:59:58 Can I just configurate them and like name them something like "Attack"
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 10:00:07 Then when I ride my F-16 it shows me?
creations-chat 2020-11-28 11:15:32 Yes that's what I watched to make the F-16
creations-chat 2020-11-28 11:17:32 I watched the tutorial then made the F-16, and I checked rules and there is no such rule as that.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 11:20:07 First of all, I followed the tutorial and made the F-16, second of all there is no such rule as that, third of all you're not a Moderator.
creations-chat 2020-11-28 13:37:03 <@414359638302130176>  That is so amazing wow really nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:54:22 i made a creation
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:54:34 some weird looking car with rockets and guns
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:08 i have a question
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:18 About the TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:31 How do you make it fall
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:39 Then it explodes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:44 hOw
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:55:59 where do I find that
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:01 like
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:05 It falls down
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:16 When it touches the ground it explodes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:23 Where do I find disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:28 on what section
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:32 on the build mode
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:41 oh okay
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:53 and how do I put the disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:56:57 in what way
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:57:38 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:57:44 and the head is bigger
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:57:47 or base?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:58:21 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:58:34 after i add the disconnecters i put the TNT over them?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:58:54 like on a side
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:59:09 like a wall of blocks then disconnecters and then TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:59:33 okay
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:59:37 I'll try that
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 14:59:53 okay
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:06:12 So I tried what you said and
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:06:17 It jusf extends the TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:06:25 It doesn't make the TNT fall
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:06:35 And the TNT doesn't explode or anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:07:01 pistons
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:07:12 I couldn't find disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:07:18 I checked where the pistons section were
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:07:25 And saw no disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:08:11 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:08:19 let me check again
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:27:08 okay so after i named my disconnecters "ATTACK" then the TNT "EXPLOSIVE" i get into my car and click attack, nothing happens, then i click explosive and my car is blown into pieces
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:27:12 so that's a fail
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:38:24 what i wanted it to do so the disconnecters push the TNT to the ground, then the TNT explodes.
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 15:38:27 but big fail
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:21:45 should I make a plane full of TNT then just kamikaze into Cars/Planes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:22:15 should I make a Car that drops TNT ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:22:46 The shredder bugs annoy me
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:22:59 Like you can't even move out of spawn when there is one around
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:23:56 The TNT car idea I got from some random guy that dropped TNT on me while I was on spawn trying to fly with my Fighter Jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:24:06 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:24:09 that's me
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:24:11 low effort
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:24:30 just some tires, slap some blocks, then some guns and rockets, then disconnecters, then tnt
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:24:34 and boom you have it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:25:03 i have
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:25:06 A F-16
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:26:12 Like the F-16 has 2 tires on the stomach
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:26:21 And a small landing gear at the chest at bottom
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:27:10 bottom
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:28:05 should I make a car with a AA on it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:28:19 imagine the turning
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:28:28 lol no
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:29:03 a car like a Toyota, with a AA on its back
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:29:27 someone make the largest helicopter possible
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:29:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:29:43 That
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:29:46 is the idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:30:10 then after i do it I'll slap a UK flag on it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:31:02 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:31:06 or norwegian isis
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:31:11 since i am from Norway
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:31:49 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:32:32 my weird looking car has TNT on the front and rockets on the back and guns on the left
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:33:17 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:33:33 i make low effort builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:33:54 the only big effort build i made is a F-16 which i copied from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:34:00 264 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:34:18 everyone chilling until a car drops TNT on you
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:34:52 Okay so
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:34:55 On the car
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:34:58 Make a wall
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:04 Then add disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:14 Then put the TNT on the disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:18 Then hop in your car
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:20 Press G
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:25 Which drops the TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:27 Them press E
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:30 or F
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:33 i mean F
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:35:43 and then it explodes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:36:43 what if I somehow cover the sides with iron blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:36:50 and turn away from you
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:36:57 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:36:59 or metal
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:03 whatever it's called
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:23 i don't really like using my F-16
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:33 since it takes some time turning
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:41 and going down
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:49 but it's good after all
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:37:58 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:38:15 #!#+#+
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:38:17 anyway
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:38:25 should i make a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:38:32 okay
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:38:57 my jet goes like 400 speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:39:46 is there any way you can kill a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:39:54 like can you kill it with a AA
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:39:56 or tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:40:01 or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 19:09:05 isn't maximum roblox fps 60?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:13:29 time to go kamikaze in plans crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:13:36 plane*
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:24:31 just made a tank and it looks deformed
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:24:38 it doesn't even look like a tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:39:18 should I buy a RC tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:39:25 that you can put BBs in it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:39:27 and it shoots
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:39:36 i want to make a collection
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:44:51 i will maybe buy a airsoft gun but not to literally get killed
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:17 i wouldn't want a real gun bullet in my chest or leg or whatever
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:19 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:23 i can buy like
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:31 a rifle or gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:33 and
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:36 equipment
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:45:43 for airsoft
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 23:07:46 I think I should buy a new PC than airsoft
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 23:08:10 Or a Gaming Laptop
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 23:08:22 I am not really experienced with mouse
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 23:08:32 Mostly with touchpad
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 22:36:16 just made a rescue Boat
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 23:18:02 i want to build a destroyer but i feel like i am gonna mess something up and just abandon it
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:28:00 was making a rescue Helicopter and i barely finished like half of the part, then i crashed and i lost all of my progress ðŸ˜­ it took me 1 hour
