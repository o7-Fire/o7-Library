The Tale of lukkako (332102654392139788)
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 00:43:47 Im tryna make a harrier but it just flips on its back when vtoling
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 00:43:49 How do i fix
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 00:45:03 I have a single helium block in the nose to stabilize it during flight but i don’t think that’s enough to make it flip the speed it does
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 00:46:11 i know that but if i remove the single helium block it goes downwards when i fly, i already tried removing it but it still flips
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 00:46:53 maybe i can add a downwards facing engine somewhere idk
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 12:48:18 yeah i realized that roblox has just disabled public audios hahah
general 2022-11-04 23:44:08 Did pc2 get cancelled?
general 2022-11-04 23:44:53 alr man i just saw someone else say it was
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:11:37 are summer and winter events annually or a one time thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:12:21 and if they are when does winter event start
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:13:09 so does the event just start whenever it snows at the gamedevs place lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 11:09:45 The wings look a tad bit too far back, or maybe the cockpit area is too large
general 2022-11-30 21:42:55 How aerodynamic is this?
general 2022-11-30 21:43:08 can this reach mach 7?

plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:19:05 how do i steer it though
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:19:08 propellers?
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:20:28 i will figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:20:35 should i arm the flying cow
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:37:36 genius
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 18:37:52 im gonna make so the cow can open its mouth and a gun comes out
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:05:18 damn thats amazing
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:13:37 yeah i noticed that
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:13:40 somehow i didnt before
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:13:58 thats embarassing
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:15:56 fixed it
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 20:15:59 now im proud
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:21:12 wip harrier with featuring no messy angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:24:11 i could try but this is my first time using angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:24:20 i’ll try to make the nose better
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:27:04 i wanna make the rod things on the canopy too so i’ll probably remake the entire front end eventually
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:38:11 no idea what that is but
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:51:30 Didn’t he say confidently it would be out in 2022
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:51:45 yeah devving takes alot of time but wouldn’t he update us on a postponing
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:52:18 or maybe it’s a suprise and we’re getting pranked (copium)
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:58:38 Doesn’t he have a dev team too now? Maybe there is something going on behind the scenes we don’t know
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 21:58:47 couch cough lawsuit incident
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:03:31 maybe we can ask him nicely
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:05:03 
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:05:55 didn’t he put out a hiring developers thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:06:26 
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:06:45 oh well we’ll just have to wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:07:04 interested in what those issues are though
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 22:09:06 really excited for infinite ocean
general 2022-12-12 22:11:09 this statement is not true, cat owners can be dangerously mislead

general 2022-12-12 22:25:47 i would live past death to play pc2
general 2022-12-12 22:26:10 how can you die peacefully knowing pc2 hasnt released
general 2022-12-12 22:26:15 personally i wouldn’t have that
general 2022-12-12 22:26:34 no it was real
general 2022-12-12 22:26:39 but he dropped it on wet floor
general 2022-12-12 22:26:40 and it died
general 2022-12-12 22:27:04 im telling you rickje dropped pc2 on wet floor
general 2022-12-12 22:27:05 and it died
general 2022-12-12 22:27:22 He probably forgot to publish it to roblox and his hard drive fried

general 2022-12-12 22:39:56 fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 06:46:28 i made landing gear but idk how to slim it down
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 06:46:44 very bulky
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 06:47:38 guess i worded it wrong
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 06:47:44 i made it so it counters the rotation of the wing
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 15:35:20 why is there no regular landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 15:35:22 this is a crime
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:41:12 pc2 info my life is complete now
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:42:39 motor 2?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:42:55 yeah they’re just kinda like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:43:04 sometimes they work and sometimes they dont
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:43:22 same issue with my tomcat when making elevons
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 18:43:44 it doesn’t like being combined with other moving parts
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:06 didnt rickje say gliding would be possible in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:14 cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:22 how tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:31 Wouldnt he have to change alot of the physics for that
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:42 or did he just reduce the drag on wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:37 but like if i turn off my engines will my vehicle keep its momentum
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:25 because right now planes decelerate super quickly
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:30 and its unrealistic
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:33 🤓
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:07 i think the scale thing means that wedges will just be combined into 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:16 or something like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:35 the only thing i desire is a 3 block long landkng gear
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:46 for my harrier
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:21 no i just want landing gear thats longer
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:31 so i dont have to make custom ones for my harrier
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:40 because the wings have gear
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:52 that needs to be longer than the gear on the plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:02 but the tiny gear is too short
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:44 like missiles?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:41:56 motorlocked blocks on wings will only affect them if pc2 simulates lift and drag for every block
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:42:17 because currently every block is just weight and wings create lift
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:42:32 i think
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:43:37 i just wished they had better trackkng
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:43:59 or maybe a targeting system
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:44:02 like laser guided bombs
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:44:06 so there is still some skill
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:44:09 in getting lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:44:13 on an opponent
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:44:44 Lock on missiles and flare launchers would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:45:53 Flares would balance them out
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:45:57 so they wont be too op

plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:44:43 show me
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:46:27 i\ll think about it
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:46:41 kinda thinking about making a tornado though
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:49:21 should i make the tornado nose 2 wide or 3 wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:49:26 my f14 is 2 wide for reference
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:49:32 and the tornado is fat
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:50:51 this is my f14 for reference
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:51:03 i will have to make 3 wide nose or make the rest of the plane proportionally smaller
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:51:56 really not the other way around?
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:52:01 tornado nose is considerably fatter
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:56:08 i dont think this looks better tbh
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:56:21 i made it 3 wide just to see how it looks
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:56:56 im not that good at this game so sticking to 2 wide lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:57:42 its harder to make it look right imo
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:58:22 might also be because i made the plane proportional to 2 wide but thats beside the point
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 14:59:13 
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 15:01:11 if i remake it some day ill do 3 wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 15:01:14 big if
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 15:02:46 i'll make the tornado 2 wide cus im used to that
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 15:06:48 lmao i forgot about my detach wings button

creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:50:06 yes
creations-chat 2022-12-23 23:53:45 try removing the rocket engine just to see how it looks
creations-chat 2022-12-23 23:56:01 i think the blue is too blue, it contrasts too much with the rocket engine, maybe make some sort of gradient (if thats possible)
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:05:50 i made these afterburners if you want inspiration
ima screenshot when chat slowmode ends
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:07:51 the lighter color is the one facing outwards, it has a longer lifetime which gives the gradient effect
the outer one has 0.05 lifetime, 2nd one has 0.05 too, 3rd one has 0.04 and 4th one has 0.03 liftime. outer one also has higher transparency
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:14:51 wait no i got it completely wrong, light one is 0.5 transparency and 0.01 lifetime, blue ones are 0.1 transparency and  0.05 lifetime
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 00:10:30 Should i make a Gripen or a Viggen

plane-crazy 2022-12-25 00:29:20 draken is meh, gripen was born with a head way too large and the viggens canards could probably turn it into a makeshift starfighter
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 00:29:37 Viggen looks very powerful though
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 00:29:41 muscle plane ish
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 00:30:12 draken is unconventional which makes it cool in its own way

general 2022-12-29 12:59:58 a voxel is aa value in a 3d space (thanks google)
general 2022-12-29 13:00:24 so entire voxel probably means the entire build

general 2023-01-03 01:55:38 bro is a genius
general 2023-01-03 01:56:15 radars would be cool in pc2 because infinite ocean
general 2023-01-03 01:56:59 im gonna build a cruise ship on pc2
general 2023-01-03 01:57:04 and just get people on it
general 2023-01-03 01:57:10 and then just drive away for like an hour
general 2023-01-03 01:57:12 and then back
general 2023-01-03 01:57:19 prime pc2 experience
general 2023-01-03 01:58:02 radar = spinning green suspension (it works like real suspension when it hits something)
general 2023-01-03 01:58:52 most relevant pcc reply
general 2023-01-03 01:59:29 radars are useless because the pc map is smaller than a spec of dust
general 2023-01-03 02:01:01 Hey baby, did you know that the F-14 is a swing-wing air superiority navy fighter jet designed for high maneuverability and high speed interception?
general 2023-01-03 02:02:19 Stop saying cuss words guys!!!! Its innapropriate and violent!!!
general 2023-01-03 02:02:57 you cant create gas in plane crazy
general 2023-01-03 02:03:19 no were being smarty sciency here
general 2023-01-03 02:03:26 smoke from smoke pipes doesnt have mass
general 2023-01-03 02:03:29 its just pngs
general 2023-01-03 02:03:37 gas has mass
general 2023-01-03 02:03:43 so its not gas 🤓🤓🤓
general 2023-01-03 02:04:10 bro who the fuck is printing images of smoke pipes
general 2023-01-03 02:05:26 <@696851246325432321> and <@929018144499048569> sitting huddled around a monitor printing images of smoke pipes to prove plane crazy has gas

general 2023-01-03 02:06:28 im excited for infinite oceans and space
general 2023-01-03 02:06:39 i wanna build a cruise ship
general 2023-01-03 02:06:45 and a cool spaceship
general 2023-01-03 02:06:53 because thats what i should be doing with my life

general 2023-01-03 02:07:49 gliding will be possible in pc2 right
general 2023-01-03 02:08:39 pvp jets shitting their pants when they realize they cant pull a 250G deceleration in pc2
general 2023-01-03 02:10:50 basically wings in pc make plane not go down  while wings in pc2 makes plane go up
general 2023-01-03 02:12:29 top 10 conversations
general 2023-01-03 02:12:47 tldr pc2 will make gliding possible because lift and drag more realistic
general 2023-01-03 02:14:06 no because rectangles arent aerodynamic
general 2023-01-03 02:14:08 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-03 02:15:25 pc wings make plane not go down
general 2023-01-03 02:15:29 pc2 wings make plane go up
general 2023-01-03 02:15:47 death note intelligence battle shit
general 2023-01-03 02:17:20 because people in this server play this game religiously and anything that isn’t 5000 blocks worth of motorlock is bad
general 2023-01-03 02:17:29 or because your build is actually bad
general 2023-01-03 02:18:03 man you can barely see the build
general 2023-01-03 02:18:07 its just guis
general 2023-01-03 02:20:20 lift is pushing up, upwards drag is pushing against something pushing down
general 2023-01-03 02:21:49 gonna be brutally honest here, 1 wide jets are pretty hated (for good reason) it’s fine for a first time thing but there’s exposed motorlock other problems
general 2023-01-03 02:21:55 just keep building
general 2023-01-03 02:22:19 they dont look as good
general 2023-01-03 02:22:24 and namnam
general 2023-01-03 02:24:02 2 wides are the most to scale right
general 2023-01-03 02:25:11 speed has nothing to do with the build
general 2023-01-03 02:25:17 just use hover drives
general 2023-01-03 02:25:25 and pvp doesnt matter
general 2023-01-03 02:25:40 because its a building game with pvp
general 2023-01-03 02:25:47 Not a pvp building game
general 2023-01-03 02:26:20 how did we go from ”more realistic deceleration and gliding cool” to flame war about lift
general 2023-01-03 02:28:02 rickje just said gliding is possible in pc2
general 2023-01-03 02:28:10 we just assume what that means
general 2023-01-03 02:28:48 my guess is that planes actually keep their momentum
general 2023-01-03 02:29:02 because a car doesnt stop when you go off throttle
general 2023-01-03 02:29:28 because they keep their momentum
general 2023-01-03 02:29:35 and can glide
general 2023-01-03 02:29:37 idk
general 2023-01-03 02:29:39 its 3am
general 2023-01-03 02:29:54 other way around
general 2023-01-03 02:30:03 slow air below
general 2023-01-03 02:30:08 fast on top
general 2023-01-03 02:30:55 man go ask someone who has a worse social filter
general 2023-01-03 02:31:16 because i cant criticize stuff without feeling bad
general 2023-01-03 02:31:49 how do we know if it seperates the air based on race
general 2023-01-03 02:31:56 maybe the wings are sexist too
general 2023-01-03 02:33:25 im too tired for this but isnt it basically that its so fast the wingtips deflect away all the air from the airfoil
general 2023-01-03 02:33:41 yeah or that
general 2023-01-03 02:34:23 bro dropped a 500 word A+ graded facts based essay

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:15:15 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:21:11 should the main pilot seat be the upper or lower one
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:21:24 lower makes more sense but upper has much better visibility
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:21:55 i was gonna put a steering wheel thing on both of them but im space limited
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:22:06 actually wiat no
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:23:30 its gonna be a fighter bomber so actualyl that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:26:44 i'll give the lower one the steering
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:26:59 looks really scuffed if its sitting this close to the front lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:27:51 yeah im doign that
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:28:23 its not a really detailed cockpit anyways so it probably doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:28:37 i found this model on sketchfab and im basing it off of that
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:29:15 yeah but im only basing it loosely on the deisgn
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:29:28 tandem seat is cooler <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 15:30:37 presonally i think asymmetry works better when its like a really big ship

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 17:57:13 Wyou wont get good at building from other people making stuff for you
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:12:32 anyone have ideas on how i can hide the motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 21:12:39 better
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:16:25 Should i make MiG-25 or F-22
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:27:53 actually i might wanna make something carrier based idk im bad at deciding stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:02 bismarck
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:39 make it sink historically accurately
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:29:17 i should probably write a list of things i want to build
general 2023-01-04 23:29:51 What does scaling in pc2 actually do
general 2023-01-04 23:30:03 does it scale the entire build or just certain blocks or what
general 2023-01-04 23:30:08 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:30:51 I wanna get into building ships but im already not that good at building in general
general 2023-01-04 23:31:53 so i cant build giant planes in pc2 and then scale them down to make them ”roscale”
general 2023-01-04 23:32:14 damn

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:40:00 maybe
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:40:05 but it would lose all maneuverability
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:50:47 stealth is probably a bit overrated
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:51:10 it works but bvr is boring

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:21:52 the part of the fuselage like where the wings connect is too long
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:29:35 why is it in 2 parts
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:30:28 the f14 doesnt have that
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:30:37 its just 1 big elevator
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:33:09 yeah but it isnt split
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:33:35 just do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:33:48 if you want both

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 12:49:12 ez pro gamer 5 minute zero for carrier
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:12:44 isnt there a method to make the rockets go super fast lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:13:14 he knows the method
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:13:49 is this factual
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:13:57 mach 1 at sea level is 1214 studs pert second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:18 so your plane would have to be gpomg 2428 studs per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:20 to go mach 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:25 at sea level
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:42 fast boi
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:09 casual mach 3 sea level
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:16 1214
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:39 1 kmh is actually really similar to a stud per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:45 i calculated it
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:11 wait ima calculate again
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:28 1225 kmh is 340 meters per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:48 340/0.28 is meters per second in studs per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:55 1214
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:56 studs per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:17:01 i did the math
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:19:49 so mach 2 is 1214x2
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:19:58 ez calculations
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:08 damn the darkstar would go 12140 studs per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:15 if you care about accuracy
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:47 is 2 square
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:55 very round
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:56 very beautiful
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:21:07 most skilled pvp plane builder
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:21:31 i think its too small to make it rounded
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:21:38 unless you do a stupid amount of angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:22:10 sho uhm guyth, this ith my new eff fiftheen figther jet 🤓
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:23:12 it can pull 250 g fortheth and turn 360 degreeth in 1.2 theconths
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:23:27 he probably types with a lisp
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:23:58 imo nam nam one wides dont look terrible, they're just WAYYYY overbuilt
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:24:21 they work well for carriers

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:27 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:41 but daddy namnam said pyramid wedge nose is only for russian jets!!!
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:27:08 to be fair trapdoor wings are good for maneuverability
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:27:14 i think
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:27:50 they increase angle of attack since all of the lift is from the elevators lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:28:55 try building a realistic ish jet once
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:28:57 you will never go back
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:28 you can make realistic jets maneuverable too lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:36 just add a fuckton of ballast at the back
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:42 and it turns
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:30:10 wasd best

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:22:21 actually mig29k doesnt have the gills
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:22:26 thats the wrong model i sent
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:22:30 thats just a regular mig29
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:22:54 anyways camera
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:24:27 something feels off but idk what
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:24:35 yes i know there arent any engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:24:37 thats not it
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:24:56 like the plane has goofy proportions but mine looks goofier for osme reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:27:32 like it looks accurate so idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:28:00 maybe no droop snoot thats why
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:28:19 also it isnt canopy since its different on the 29k to the reference
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:30:06 ok already looks better
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:33:06 ok already looks better part 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:40:02 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:40:39 i dont see anything wrong with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:45:58 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:46:33 im not gonna figure that out today tho lmao

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:30:55 yeah thats the one im building lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:31:00 mig29k
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:31:07 yeah noone will know
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:31:53 only noticable difference is that the mig29k wings have slightly bigger flaps and no gills
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:32:35 i did make it fold before but it looked ugly
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:32:37 no fold anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:32:48 also i should probably make its engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:32:53 they're pretty important i think

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:25:02 cause if i go practicality i will have some exposed motor 2s but much better performence
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:25:04 and wing fold
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:26:00 0 exposed motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:26:02 waow
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:26:23 759
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:26:52 so exposed motor 2s and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:27:57 yes it has makeshift engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:27:59 it flies pretty well
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:28:17 the elevators do get stuck though
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:29:09 maybe
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:29:17 not alot i can stuff into the nose though
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:29:43 its not really that big tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:30:28 currently i use hidden cheese graters for roll
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:30:33 it works well
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:30:39 just a bit ugly
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:31:28 but yeah no wing fold
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:31:36 which is sad because its a carrier based mig29
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:31:57 excatly
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:32:00 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:32:11 i could make 2 versions
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:32:41 alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:34:03 elevators can roll now
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:34:31 nvm this wont work when flying
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:34:36 motor 2s are too buggy
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:41:59 dont mind the engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 11:42:04 i have finished the underbody yet lmao

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:40 ohhhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:28:47 exposed motorlock <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:32:40 bro started spraying

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:10:12 landing gear waow
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:20:36 that is indeed comically large
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:23:20 
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:27:32 how are you even supposed to do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:28:20 lmao i made my conveyors the wrong way
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:29:45 god i hate conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:31:30 3277 studs per second
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:32:03 mach 1 is 1214 sps
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:32:07 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:32:34 studs per second is just meters per second / 0.28
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:32:50 darkstar would be 12140 sps
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:33:34 i did the calculation at like 2 am
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:33:35 wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:33:52 1 stud is 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:34:42 yeah thats the old version
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:34:44 they changed it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:35:13 so my calculation was right
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:35:47 meters per second = studs per second x 0.28
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:35:49 and vice versa
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:36:01 well if you divide instead
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:36:46 the average plane is probably close to roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:36:49 1 wide isnt roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:38:19 time to figure out how to make my mig go fast
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:38:26 excessive motorlock lets go
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:39:11 time to hide it with fuel tank
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:39:12 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:39:19 yeah thats what im gonna do
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:39:29 i just need to figure out how to cram in the motorlock

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 16:42:17 first attempt at something decent, it's bad but its a goofy pvp roscale mig29, 1000 blocks, wip  and i think it can make the hall of fame. It took around 10 hours to build. It has some exposed motorlock on the belly but that doesnt matter, downvote if you want. <:clueless:942802644043464734>

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 22:32:36 time to spend my entire tomorrow making this
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:22:06 average roscaler
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:23:09 its like
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:23:17 half scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:23:23 maybe 1/3
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:23:31 wait ima calculate it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:23:54 im just gonna calculate lengrh
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:24:27 its 11 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:24:32 if im not blind
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:24:43 1 block is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:24:49 1 stud is 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:25:41 so 1 block is 0.7 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:26:06 its half scale lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:26:19 damn the A-10 is ting
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:26:21 tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:26:36 Its only 2 meters longer than an F-16
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:28:47 <@568036773750505502> how did you manage to make a roscale plane 1:2 scale
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:30:53 no like why is it half scale if it’s supposed to be roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:33:08 roscale is just irl dimensions, so roscale a-10 should be around 24 blocks long
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:36:07 its like 5 blocks off in length, so not roscale, roscale phantom would be 27 blocks long
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:38:13 Roscale phantom should be 27x17 blocks
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:40:28 HOW LONG IS IT

plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:20:47 basically ever
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:20:57 Roblox moderation is just bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:21:17 but atleast it’s needed
general 2023-01-11 22:26:24 bro is making build a boat premium

plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:25:23 no wings lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 11:56:28 awesome sauce
general 2023-01-14 23:33:06 
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 23:35:08 flat cause it fits with cockpit better

general 2023-01-14 23:42:13 what am i even looking at
general 2023-01-14 23:43:02 why did bro angle lock the entire wing
general 2023-01-14 23:43:11 why is the seat outside the cockpit
general 2023-01-14 23:43:15 why is there a random cylinder
general 2023-01-14 23:43:48 bro rocking the slightly tilted rockets
general 2023-01-14 23:44:17 half circle ass canopy
general 2023-01-14 23:44:29 why are the rudders like
general 2023-01-14 23:44:31 2 parts
general 2023-01-14 23:44:42 pvp plane nightmare
general 2023-01-14 23:45:00 namnam jets yes shredders probably not
general 2023-01-14 23:45:05 shredders are slow as hell anyways
general 2023-01-14 23:45:26 also you can turn off gravity in plane crazy lmao
general 2023-01-14 23:46:31 plane crazy physics are so janky anyways it wouldn’t work
general 2023-01-14 23:49:53 g forces dont even matter for stuff like cobra maneuver
general 2023-01-14 23:51:07 i don’t think it would be possible
general 2023-01-14 23:51:34 no because you have to make a calculation for time sustained etc
general 2023-01-14 23:51:49 you could but then rickje would have to work on the game
general 2023-01-14 23:53:01 also it would make spaceships with movement like in movies impossible
general 2023-01-14 23:53:14 because we cant make intertia dampeners in plane crazy
general 2023-01-14 23:53:41 also gravity slider exists
general 2023-01-14 23:53:58 so people would just make their jets 0g compatible and never have to deal with g forces
general 2023-01-14 23:54:27 i think instead of g forces
general 2023-01-14 23:54:53 rickje should work on fixing physics
general 2023-01-14 23:55:05 because aerodynamics dont matter in this game
general 2023-01-14 23:55:10 and that
general 2023-01-14 23:56:17 blocks dont exist in the ”physics engine” of pc so only the wings matter
general 2023-01-14 23:56:33 which makes every plane ever supermaneuverable
general 2023-01-14 23:56:44 because you can just make the elevators the entire plane
general 2023-01-14 23:56:58 there is a gamemode called no pvp
general 2023-01-14 23:57:05 there is also a leave button
general 2023-01-14 23:57:11 its a core feature of roblox
general 2023-01-14 23:57:34 shredders are really not as big of an issue as people make them out to be
general 2023-01-14 23:57:40 just join another server
general 2023-01-14 23:57:44 or dont play pvp
general 2023-01-14 23:59:47 plane crazy is a really boring game tbh
general 2023-01-14 23:59:53 its more fun when you dont play it alot
general 2023-01-15 00:00:53 pc2 is softcoded
general 2023-01-15 00:00:58 but still a really stupid idea
general 2023-01-15 00:01:02 because gravity slider
general 2023-01-15 00:01:06 and spaceships
general 2023-01-15 00:01:36 like i try to keep my planes ”realistic” but they probably pull like 15g
general 2023-01-15 00:01:38 atleast
general 2023-01-15 00:01:45 it would never work for jet combat
general 2023-01-15 00:01:49 only for like
general 2023-01-15 00:01:52 stupidly small props
general 2023-01-15 00:01:55 because they are slow
general 2023-01-15 00:01:58 and tight turn radius
general 2023-01-15 00:02:04 missiles
general 2023-01-15 00:02:11 we dont have missiles in plane crazy
general 2023-01-15 00:02:28 thats why g forces would ruin dogfighting
general 2023-01-15 00:02:37 no
general 2023-01-15 00:02:39 lmao
general 2023-01-15 00:02:46 that would just be worse than shredders
general 2023-01-15 00:03:37 fox 2 is a radar missile i think
general 2023-01-15 00:03:40 fox 1 is ir
general 2023-01-15 00:03:45 fox 3 is active radar
general 2023-01-15 00:03:59 plane crazy is not a pvp game

general 2023-01-15 00:07:50 Automatically guided missiles and g forces interfere with plane crazy fundamentally
general 2023-01-15 00:08:04 bro got mad because plane crazy isnt war thunder
general 2023-01-15 00:08:44 his suggestions would only maybe work if plane crazy was a pvp game

plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:10:48 magnet
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:11:41 should i use toggle
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:12:03 what range
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:12:08 short or just maximum range
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:12:36 wait do i need magnets on the other side
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:13:50 so that should be off
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:14:40 ok this isnt working i'll figure out later
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:15:30 bruh how do i know if its activated
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:15:34 its just red
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:15:35 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:15:52 ill check youtube lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:16:04 oh that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 15:16:15 do i press backwards or forwards to activate it
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:22:26 bruh my autosave wont load
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:33:02 progres
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:03:41 what is the autosave slot called by defualt
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:03:49 cause i changed it and i think its bugged lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:19:06 what is the default name for autosave slot
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:53:31 is there any way to keep motors from locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:53:34 without disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:53:36 or explosives
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:53:40 nvm i
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:53:51 only explosives work cause the springs will get stuck
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 14:54:07 disconnectors have the same problem
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 16:39:59 almost done so pro
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 16:41:22 damn i gotta delete my build it pales in comparison
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:58:02 i have no idea how to make this fly lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:58:42 yus
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:25 i want it to be able to levitate while at 0 speed though
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:32 so im thinking of using 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 17:59:53 but wouldnt it just be stuck in place then
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:00:45 i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:00:49 i have another idea though
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:01:22 cause the main problem with 0 gravity is that you cant really stop the ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:01:33 so i might make an engine capable of reversing and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:02 ik what to do now
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:04:11 im gonna place all of the engines in the hull lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:05:28 oops
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:08:59 i cant figure this out lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:09:07 maybe ill just use hovers
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:09:15 but thats boring
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:11:41 if i use alot i can probably reach high altitude
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:11:51 but i want this to be compatible with the space in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:13:55 couldnt i make a gyroscope lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:14:00 i saw a youtube video
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:14:01 on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:21:23 shit the build height is 1 block too high
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:21:28 \low
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:23:11 nvm i found a workaround
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:23:16 it will look slightly worse though
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:28:41 only engines left now
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 18:46:54 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:05:40 ok i saw a thing on youtube
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:05:48 can i use a fuckton of hovers with alot of drag
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:05:51 to make it stay in the air
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:05:55 and i slap a bunch of helium on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:07:15 fuck being "chad"
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:07:26 im just gonna use whatever works best lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:20:02 if im using hover engines and drag and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 19:20:10 do i need the hover thrusters to be at the center of mass
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 14:41:11 it do be flying
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 14:53:04 INVERTED FRIGATE RAHHH

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 19:32:32 probably
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 19:32:53 oh and i gotta add a hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 19:33:06 and sound effects
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 19:45:05 hyperdrive fr fr
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 19:46:53 lmao i forgot i have to make it decelerate
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 20:45:41 why is the server so dead today
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 20:45:42 damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:24:59 su-57 isnt even a fulcrum
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:25:03 bro got it wrong twice
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:25:18 f-57 fulcrum
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:25:51 fulcrum is mig29 and mig35
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:26:30 is 30k sps enough for my hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:26:44 or do i go faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:26:49 probably
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:27:19 idk how i’ll make it faster though
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:27:28 idk if i can fit more conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:27:32 it has 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:27:41 i can probably fit it
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:29:12 what sound effects should i add to it
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:29:47 munificent smh
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:30:40 im gonna add a sonic boom thing for hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:30:49 and probably some laser bolts
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:32:01 how fast can i go before motors start breaking and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:34:10 probably not on your side
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 21:34:17 plane crazy is just really buggy
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:05 because its smol (relative to its real size lmao)
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:18 its 2 plots long
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:24 used the entire height limit lmao
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:11:17 if i change material to something like metal it gets too heavy
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:11:40 so idk how to make it less plastic
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 23:12:28 how can i make it look less like plastic
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 23:12:31 i cant unsee it
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:20:16 Smaller elevators, make the like front part of the wing transition smoothly  instead of the 1 block skip down (see image), also move the elevators up 1 block, they are too far away from the wing.
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 23:26:09 idrk where to add detail though
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:26:43 i feel like deleting it now thanks
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 23:26:59 im at height limit and don’t really have any room to decorate
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 23:27:21 i’ll figure something out ig
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:28:50 uwuified munificent
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:33:10 can someone help me make these guns
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:33:14 go up an down too
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:33:29 its really simple i just dont remember lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:37:51 figured it out
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:37:54 really ugly tough lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:37:55 
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:38:13 nvm that wont work
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:38:20 since other guns are next to it
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:38:21 oh well
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 18:42:02 this works
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 11:21:32 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 11:21:39 work of art
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:06:38 so basically you use a fuckton of helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:06:49 and hover engines with max drag and no speed to stabilise
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:07:31 practicality >
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:08:08 its 1214 sps
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:10:08 sps is (m/s)/0.28
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:11:47 
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:13:07 no its 343/0.28
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:13:36 ro-scale bitches
general 2023-02-02 22:25:15 mmm
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:44:37 how should i fix the gap between elevators and wings
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:45:21 are elevators too small
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:45:24 or are wings to small
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:45:27 cause i cant figure it out
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:58:16 i figured it out
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:58:37 my elevators are disproportionately huge so im gonna scale up the wings and nose
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:01:57 because motor 2s are stupid
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:02:31 i cant make the elevators do both pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:02:34 because motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:02:36 are stupid
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:02:58 yeah im gonna switch to that
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:08:03 bro used his left hand
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:09:10 it almost aligns perfectly if i dont use the delta wing on the end
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:10:43 idk i looked at war thunder gameplay and it looked like it rotated from there
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 20:14:48 thjis better?

plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:33:38 anything but plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:34:47 i think my plane has like slightly asymmetrical thrust
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:34:52 because it yaws left sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:37:09 im gonna use propellers for yaw
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:37:13 because fuck rudders
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:37:29 making a good looking functional rudder challenger (impossible)
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 08:48:01 HIDDDEN RUDDERS RAHHHHH
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 09:12:07 i used normal blocks

plane-crazy 2023-02-10 16:58:08 nvm the plot is too small
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:20:09 not on my pc anymore  it would turn really well  it could barely roll lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:21:42 control surfaces are so bad but they look so good
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 17:22:44 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 20:46:27 plane crazy more like diabolical flying vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 22:38:02 instructions unclear, mounted rudder sideways
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 22:54:24 bro is rather constricted
creations-chat 2023-02-10 23:02:09 it used to have camo its actually a revamp, i might redo the camo but idk how to make the canopy better cause its tiny irl

i think theres some old version of it in creations somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 23:03:26 yeah i just realized its pretty similar to his mig23
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 15:27:38 people who call the gripen f39 offend me
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 15:28:47 idc if its called that in brazil

plane-crazy 2023-02-12 15:33:10 should i make f22 with 3 wide or 2 wide nose
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 16:24:01 how
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 16:24:10 there arent quarter blocks in this gmae
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 16:24:46 yeah i think that might be most accurate

plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:16:11 1224 sps
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:16:12 i think
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:16:47 i think its just meters per seocnd divided by 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:16:49 and you get sps
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:17:03 nvm no
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:17:34 its 1214 sps
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:17:37 i did the math a while ago
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:18:44 mildly disintegrating spaceship

plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:19:23 liar
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:20:01 
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:20:35 bro is joining the conspiracy
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:21:28 also no 20 studs is not 1 meter
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:21:32 they changed it
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:21:44 1 stud = .28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:22:01 so meters per second to studs per second is just meters per second / 0.27
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:22:33 343 actually
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 19:23:15

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 13:18:36 1 million dollars per month
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:38:14 help
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:38:17 why is it tilting
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:38:21 on 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:38:41 and no wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:38:50 how fix
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:15 endurance
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:17 from interstellar
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:32 does ballast do anything on 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:36 since its
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:37 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:41 no weight
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:40:44 its unbalanced right now but that shouldnt matter
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:40:48 it might be a bug though
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:40:53 i have another spaceship with same issue
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:40:58 because materials are bugged
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:41:02 its 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:41:33 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:42:17 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:42:41 it worked before though
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:42:46 ill fix it somehow i guess
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:38 yay ballast block fixed it
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:40 kind of
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:45 now it tilts to the left
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:46 instead
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:51 oh well
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:44:57 ik why though
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:45:10 center of mass is slightly left
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:45:19 because of motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:45:45 maybe ill make it work in normal gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:45:56 and use max drag hovers
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:45:58 because bugs
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:46:13 will probably work better
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:46:34 i forgot if you want the hovers close to center or far away
