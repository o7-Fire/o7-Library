plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:27:19 besides the fact that most content will be blocked in the eu to be safe
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:27:38 i was gonna post that :(
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:28:14 that's not a video mate
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:28:40 The proposed version of Article 13 would eliminate the existing notice-and-takedown system currently in place to protect rightsholders and platforms. This would make platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Soundcloud, Dailymotion, Reddit and Snapchat liable - at the moment of upload - for any copyright infringement in uploads from users, creators and artists.
    This in turn would mean that platforms including YouTube would be forced to block the vast majority of uploads from Europe and views in Europe for content uploaded elsewhere given the uncertainty and complexity of copyright ownership (more on this below).
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:29:08 As a result, YouTube would be forced to block millions of videos (existing and new ones) in the European Union. It could drastically limit the content that one can upload to the platform in Europe.

creations-chat 2018-12-02 09:57:31 mine wobbles way too much
help 2018-12-02 10:06:23 so what do ball wheels do
creations-chat 2018-12-02 10:36:40 that's actually a pretty nice shape
creations-chat 2018-12-02 10:36:48 could be awesome scaled up as a plane

plane-crazy 2018-12-02 10:44:28 lovely name
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 10:45:16 oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 11:26:53 it would be nice to have a rubber type of block that has traction so you can make better custom wheels
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 11:26:56 like the opposite of ice
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 11:49:21 that's a long boi
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 13:49:04 so i finally found out why my tandem rotors would always wobble and then die

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 12:56:47 my tandem copter loves to wobble out of control in the air so i'm gonna try to make a gyro stabilizer
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 12:57:41 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:27:49 finally got my tandem coptor to be stable enough to hover, now i have to actually make it look good

help 2018-12-17 00:34:16 <@278351709607165953> rotors are the wrong way round
help 2018-12-17 00:35:00 also most people just make fake copters where the rotors have no actual use
help 2018-12-17 00:35:27 but if you're going for a 100% actual working heli then it can be done fairly easily
help 2018-12-17 00:36:37 this is how i made my copter work (tandem rotor setup)
help 2018-12-17 00:36:41 
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:38:10 hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:38:41 yo btw orange i'm curious, what was the proof you posted for the magnet orbit
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:38:48 i wanna see how it was done
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:39:15 ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:39:31 i could only get it working semi consistently wondered if the older one could be better
help 2018-12-17 00:39:45 huh
help 2018-12-17 00:44:32 ok
help 2018-12-17 00:44:39 well i'm rarted so oh well
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:13:42 i made a railgun
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:14:07 do you need to do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:14:23 do you need to flex on new players with your creations and crush any pride
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:14:35 why tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:14:41 it's not very welcoming
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:15:19 less experienced
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:15:24 semantics at this point
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:26:15 i made an actual railgun thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:26:36 it uses black magic
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:38:29 the world's worst railgun
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 01:40:07 ok i got an actual good gif of the railgun

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:19:22 macbooks won't work if ANY part is replaced by someone that isn't them
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:20:34 go watch Louis Rossmann to really understand how much apple is screwing their customers, he goes very in depth
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:20:40 https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:21:33 apple still sues those companies
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:22:50 that's not planned obsolescence, not sure what the term for it is though
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:23:22 /s?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:23:29 planned obselescence is when they plan for their phones to be usless after a year or so and slow the phone with updates
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:23:44 no it doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:24:01 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfbE3_uAMA
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:24:10 this mad lad did it with secondhand and unofficial parts
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:24:44 off topic channels are dumb because when mods tell you to move over it kills the convo
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:27:00 thrusters i'd assume
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:27:32 make sure they aren't gnelfs
general 2019-01-23 23:28:03 they still have to buy their ram from samsung though
general 2019-01-23 23:28:35 i heard somewhere that the iphone 8 launch exhausted like 15% of the global ram supply
general 2019-01-23 23:28:56 that was during the peak of the ram shortage though
general 2019-01-23 23:29:11 both
general 2019-01-23 23:29:14 cause and effect
general 2019-01-23 23:29:42 very hard to make without already having tons of money to invest
general 2019-01-23 23:29:54 ryzen boi here so i need ddr4
general 2019-01-23 23:31:16 holy fuckaroo

general 2019-01-23 23:31:40 ram shortage is pretty much over, that woulda cost like $8970345678946 back when i built my pc
general 2019-01-23 23:32:01 i paid more for lower clocks and 8gb
general 2019-01-23 23:32:09 this is sad
general 2019-01-23 23:32:14 i don't like looking at this
general 2019-01-23 23:32:35 well time to buy some ram
general 2019-01-23 23:33:37 $250 atleast
general 2019-01-23 23:34:27 watcha got right now
general 2019-01-23 23:35:10 ryzen 5 1500x is a pretty good budget option and can oc to 4ghz with stock cooler
general 2019-01-23 23:35:31 i;ve got an r3 1200x if you need really budget options
general 2019-01-23 23:36:13 r/wsb

general 2019-01-23 23:36:39 a bunch of 4chan autists found a bloomberg terminal
general 2019-01-23 23:37:09 uhhhhhhh
general 2019-01-23 23:38:18 2600 is amazing
general 2019-01-23 23:43:56 https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZPjMYT
general 2019-01-23 23:43:56 <@456226577798135808> this should be a solid build which is fairly underbudget so you can buy a nice monitor os something
general 2019-01-23 23:44:26 rx 580 can be swapped for a 1070 or 1070 ti if you want more power
general 2019-01-23 23:44:36 üëç
general 2019-01-23 23:48:15 oh no not a *maybe*
general 2019-01-23 23:48:29 also bios updates are easy, if a bit spooky
general 2019-01-23 23:48:40 if you brick it you should have warranty
general 2019-01-23 23:49:45 dual monitors are a godsend and i'd much rather have that than higher res
general 2019-01-23 23:50:20 flashing bios is spooky but if i remember correctly how i did it you just download the update onto a flash drive then boot from that or something
general 2019-01-23 23:50:32 just read instructions and you're safe
general 2019-01-23 23:50:42 most mobos have a dual bios to stop bircked mobos anyways
general 2019-01-23 23:51:21 my little 1050ti is a strong boi and can run most new games at medium to high so i have no doubts that a 580 should do great
general 2019-01-23 23:53:03 580's are equal to 1060's and are cheaper, 1070's are the next step up and are about ~40% faster but are much more expensive, too much to warrant an upgrade unless you have cash to spare
general 2019-01-23 23:53:39 er wait no
general 2019-01-23 23:53:42 wrong way round
general 2019-01-23 23:54:37 dual monitor is literally a must now that i've upgraded
general 2019-01-23 23:54:59 why would you want that?
general 2019-01-23 23:55:45 it's $40 cheaper and is nearly twice as slow, i'd recommend 580 as your best bang for buck
general 2019-01-23 23:55:58 that list is $800 cad is it not
general 2019-01-23 23:56:02 yes it is
general 2019-01-23 23:56:33 i can play my games and study at the same time, talk on discord and watch videos at the same time, literally god
general 2019-01-23 23:56:44 23 inch is pretty sizeable
general 2019-01-23 23:56:50 my monitor costed $80
general 2019-01-23 23:57:51 i'd very much reccomend the psu on my list, very reliable and semi modular which makes assembly much easier
general 2019-01-23 23:58:12 also the 2400g is intergrated graphics i think which is a nono if you're buying a gpu
general 2019-01-23 23:58:27 2400g is for super budget if you wanna run modern games on low
general 2019-01-23 23:58:59 are you doing assembly?
general 2019-01-23 23:59:03 CAD
general 2019-01-24 00:00:44 i went with a pretty cheap case
general 2019-01-24 00:00:56 originally i wanted a baller case but i like my minimalist look now
general 2019-01-24 00:01:50 it's micro ATX due to my smol desk, also standard ATX mobos are cheaper right now anyways
general 2019-01-24 00:02:14 i don't even remember the model
general 2019-01-24 00:02:38 shut up before i go ara ara on your ass
general 2019-01-24 00:02:46 /lenny
general 2019-01-24 00:03:44 rosewill srm 01
general 2019-01-24 00:03:44 ok i remembered
general 2019-01-24 00:03:51 very sleek
general 2019-01-24 00:04:13 rood
general 2019-01-24 00:04:37 minimalist mate, sidepanes would be against the wall with my setup anyways
general 2019-01-24 00:04:48 space restrictions remember
general 2019-01-24 00:05:53 personally i'd go for this if i was to build a pc right now
general 2019-01-24 00:05:57 $614
general 2019-01-24 00:06:18 are you assembling or is somebody else
general 2019-01-24 00:06:31 are you assembling or is somebody else
general 2019-01-24 00:06:44 are you assembling or is somebody else
general 2019-01-24 00:07:18 because if you aren't then you can give someone else the burden of working with a non modular psu
general 2019-01-24 00:08:23 i had to build in a micro atx with a non modular psu, and a small micro atx at that
general 2019-01-24 00:08:28 just about offed myself
general 2019-01-24 00:08:50 https://pcpartpicker.com/list/78WsFt
general 2019-01-24 00:08:55 but yeah this is solid
general 2019-01-24 00:09:05 and i just assume everybody has a monitor and kb by now
general 2019-01-24 00:10:04 570 is like $20 cheaper i think but 14% less performance, your choice tho
general 2019-01-24 00:10:48 fair enough
general 2019-01-24 00:11:03 lemme find a good one
general 2019-01-24 00:12:18 what's your case budget
general 2019-01-24 00:13:11 i'd go for the cheapest case with alright airflow but i'm some rart who has no care for looks
general 2019-01-24 00:14:22 you can go for this if you have no self value
general 2019-01-24 00:14:23 https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811853002
general 2019-01-24 00:14:34 i still like nice airflow
general 2019-01-24 00:15:47 oh yeah if you're going with a 1600x then you can run with stock cooler
general 2019-01-24 00:16:10 people run at a 3.8ghz OC and get 70c full load, very good]
general 2019-01-24 00:16:19 even still
general 2019-01-24 00:16:26 the ryzen stock coolers are absolute beasts
general 2019-01-24 00:17:53 yeah 2600 is even better at overclocking, some dude got it running stable 4.2ghz with stock cooler (although the probably won the silicon lottery)
general 2019-01-24 00:19:32 i guess you can if you've got a solid deal
general 2019-01-24 00:21:13 that's all from me folks
general 2019-01-24 00:21:18 time to go do some dumb shit
general 2019-01-24 00:21:52 air is air mate, you can't optimize fans too much
general 2019-01-24 00:22:11 exactly
general 2019-01-24 00:23:33 the reason we aren't at 11ghz like those dudes in the 2000's predicted is because there's not much to optimize with air as your main source of heat control
general 2019-01-24 00:23:51 a fan is a fan
general 2019-01-24 00:27:09 since air has water molecules in it technically everybody is vaping all the time
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 03:36:22 corrupt admins eh
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 03:36:44 hello

general 2019-02-23 23:45:30 i only used xray and speedhacks, i mostly use aristois for cpu optimization

general 2019-02-24 00:10:33 erasing my legacy?
general 2019-02-24 00:13:11 shoosh stole exactly 0 diamonds from me mate
general 2019-02-24 00:13:56 he said something along the lines of "to beat the cheaters you gotta become one"
general 2019-02-24 00:14:18 and then pulled a full set and an axe
general 2019-02-24 00:14:27 you tell me where he got em, i've no idea
