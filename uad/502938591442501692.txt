general 2020-12-22 00:53:39 Does this still exsist today
general 2020-12-22 00:55:51 But a tank with wings would be history
general 2020-12-22 00:56:31 I still made a flying tank in plane crazy
general 2020-12-25 02:15:30 What happens if you put this in the rain
general 2020-12-25 02:16:20 I will put it in the rain one day
general 2020-12-25 02:16:25 And see the results
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 01:43:38 How do you make your build stay in the air and not fall
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 01:45:10 Will that make my build just stay in the air and move freely?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 01:45:30 Cuz Ive seen other builds in game that move freely without gravity oulling them down
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 01:46:47 K
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 22:55:54 Is plane crazy having bugs right now or is it just me?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 22:58:04 No the motors on my build are spinning for no reasom, and the things flipping over like crazy
general 2021-06-07 17:53:26 I made a garbage truck
general 2021-06-07 17:53:57 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 02:51:38 Is plane crazy physics similar to real life or no
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 02:53:00 Ok cause I just made my build to the point where when it is in the air, it would be slowly be oulled down when it set my graviity slider to 0
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 21:08:33 Everytime one of my build touches the water, it gets flunged
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:11:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:13:05 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:13:25 I thought the wings I built over were causing it
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:14:02 Cause I made my build with wings under it to make it fly more accurate
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:14:44 But not only it flys so accurate, it also stays in the air, even when gravity level is not at 0
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:37:54 My plane can fly, it just flies as if gravity was* already at 0 when I spawn it in
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:50:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:50:58 Oh yeah I mean 180
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:51:22 Even when my gravity is at 180, my ship still flies as if it was at 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 23:52:02 But if I raise the gravity level higher than 180, it slowly falls down
