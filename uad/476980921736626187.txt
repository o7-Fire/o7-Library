general 2021-03-20 07:23:08 yall we better get team building soon ðŸ‘€
general 2021-03-20 07:23:36 lemme see
general 2021-03-20 07:24:03 i get that it might outweigh in some ways but like,
general 2021-03-20 07:24:10 even piloting folks would be good
general 2021-03-20 07:24:31 like allowing several pilots being like whitelisted for that or for building would be dope
general 2021-03-20 07:24:44 but there is a large percent that would like it
general 2021-03-20 07:24:48 yeah
general 2021-03-20 07:25:09 i know of it, havent played
general 2021-03-20 07:25:24 yeah
general 2021-03-20 07:25:36 you'd be at fault if they griefed
general 2021-03-20 07:25:41 but like
general 2021-03-20 07:25:47 you save, you should be good yknow
general 2021-03-20 07:25:55 just save before you whitelist
general 2021-03-20 07:26:29 i guess but they could just put a warning about like saving before whitelisting
general 2021-03-20 07:26:36 so its only on the fault of the player
general 2021-03-20 07:27:09 they are from the future dude
general 2021-03-20 07:27:36 i just think whitelist could be good for a lot of different like folks
general 2021-03-20 07:27:47 private servers or sum
general 2021-03-20 07:27:53 but its not the same
general 2021-03-20 07:28:25 why dont you just save your build and bam noone can glitch when you whitelist
general 2021-03-20 07:28:27 bing brain
general 2021-03-20 07:29:34 gn folks
general 2021-03-20 07:29:38 kiss kisses
