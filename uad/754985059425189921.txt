bug-reports 2020-12-19 09:50:29 I have an issue when I spawn into a any new server after joining the first time. I play on Chromebook, and when I join, everything is fine, with pc controls. But when I try and spawn into a different server, to play with pvp, I get mobile controls for some reason. Anyone know how to fix this?

(I know, very specific issue)
