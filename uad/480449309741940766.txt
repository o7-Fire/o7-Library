help 2019-09-14 20:40:53 I dunno if this really counts as help needing
help 2019-09-14 20:41:23 But how do i make things rotate vertically instead of horizontally? Is there even a way to do that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:41:36 That's cool.
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:41:47 I'd like some <#478584971670454284> in <#478584971670454284>
help 2019-09-14 20:41:51 Yes
help 2019-09-14 20:42:05 I mean like
help 2019-09-14 20:42:11 The motor
help 2019-09-14 20:42:16 Rotates things horizontally
help 2019-09-14 20:42:17 Regardless
help 2019-09-14 20:42:21 of the position it is in
help 2019-09-14 20:42:38 Is there any way to make the motor rotate vertically?
help 2019-09-14 20:42:51 How?
help 2019-09-14 20:42:57 I know how to turn it and all
help 2019-09-14 20:43:07 It legit always rotates horizontally.
help 2019-09-14 20:43:54 i have it positioned like that, turns sideways
help 2019-09-14 20:44:49 Positioned the motor like this, rotates horizontally but can make vertical things
help 2019-09-14 20:44:57 In a sense
help 2019-09-14 20:45:17 as this was the original position
help 2019-09-14 20:45:21 But it is not the rotation i am looking for
help 2019-09-14 20:45:36 Think of how a hammer is pulled back then forwards
help 2019-09-14 20:45:40 That's what i want to do
help 2019-09-14 20:45:55 Like make the motor rotate attached objects *vertically*
help 2019-09-14 20:46:06 It literally does not matter what position i try
help 2019-09-14 20:46:28 Do you not know what vertically means
help 2019-09-14 20:47:11 Yeah
help 2019-09-14 20:47:16 That's what i mean
help 2019-09-14 20:47:31 Yes.
help 2019-09-14 20:47:35 Yes.
help 2019-09-14 20:48:11 So what rotation should i use to get my wanted result?
help 2019-09-14 20:51:44 I doubt it even IS possible.
help 2019-09-14 20:52:17 <@!352928457358835715>
help 2019-09-14 20:52:28 I've tried T and Y rotations alike.
help 2019-09-14 20:52:38 I have to resort to other ideas instead.
help 2019-09-14 20:55:58 ._.
help 2019-09-14 20:56:13 I'm stupid.
help 2019-09-14 20:57:09 Exactly what i needed, thanks <@!352928457358835715>.
help 2019-09-14 21:00:20 I have run into another problem
help 2019-09-14 21:00:34 The disconnector will not disconnect the plane, it simply refuses to.
help 2019-09-14 21:01:04 It just doesn't no matter what i bind it to.
help 2019-09-14 21:01:34 Oh
help 2019-09-14 21:01:41 It was due to the fin tthing
help 2019-09-14 21:05:01 I've come across some anomaly.
help 2019-09-14 21:05:14 There's no center of lift, i have wing panels and all but NO center of lift
help 2019-09-14 21:05:43 <@!352928457358835715> I made a back-up, but how does this not have a center of lift?
help 2019-09-14 21:06:05 Thanks
help 2019-09-14 21:06:33 Still, too front heavy and i do not know how i can make this small plane be not front heavy
help 2019-09-14 21:06:49 I don't wanna make an enormous plane tho
help 2019-09-14 21:07:22 I'm gonna make it bigger.
help 2019-09-14 21:07:35 I hope the launcher can withstand the weight.
help 2019-09-14 21:09:37 Still too heavy.
help 2019-09-14 21:10:09 Wouldn't that add more back weight?
help 2019-09-14 21:10:25 And besides, the plane is ALREADY too heavy for my little launcher.
help 2019-09-14 21:10:30 I may have to scrap the idea all together.
help 2019-09-14 21:11:25 Gonna make a missile launcher instead.
help 2019-09-14 21:14:09 Nevermind.
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 21:14:22 I have absolutely no idea what i should make, anyone got any ideas?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 21:14:48 P.S i'm a beginner at the game so i cant make a dragon or a drone army or anythin like dat
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 21:15:20 Rocket fork?
help 2019-09-14 21:20:10 The delta wings are doing nothing, i literally cannot control where this rocket fork goes at all whatsoever, what can i do to control it?
help 2019-09-14 21:21:47 <@163143541160148992> Can you help me?
help 2019-09-14 21:22:14 I mean, i did try.
help 2019-09-14 21:22:35 Do i go manually set keybinds to every control surface?
help 2019-09-14 21:23:01 what does lower and raise surface mean
help 2019-09-14 21:23:40 What do they mean? It'd be cool if you didn't bruh me every time i ask a question.
help 2019-09-14 21:25:16 Well, that did not help i'd say, i just ended up turning it into a rotating rocket fork
help 2019-09-14 21:26:01 Oh.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:02 Nice job being so toxic.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:12 Good to know i'm accepted in this community.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:31 It wasn't even my idea
help 2019-09-14 21:28:09 If only there was a roblox community that didn't get mad at you for not knowing how to do something.
help 2019-09-14 21:28:40 That's why i said "if only"
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:29:33 >best i've made is just a simple propeller plane that you can make in like 2 minutes absolute max
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 21:30:27 I want some ideas that are pretty easy to make (not rockets, i'm horrible at those and cant steer them at all)
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:31:10 mfw everyone is a god at building while your only working build is a simple propeller plane
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:32:32 <@!212105708206948355> That's godly compared to anything i could make within 10000000 hourus
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:58:00 I made a little suspension car (i am a beginner at this, sorry), i'm proud of it. It doesn't rotate well but it's a pretty cool boio
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:59:09 A little propeller plane i made, seen in flight too.
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 22:01:24 Just posted some of my basic builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 09:48:43 I'm still waiting for the day i learn to make amazing stuff

general 2019-09-15 10:40:42 how does squared work again
general 2019-09-15 10:40:50 isnt 2 times 2 the same as 2 squared
general 2019-09-15 10:41:09 8 squared is 64, pal
general 2019-09-15 10:41:17 8 times 8 is 64¨
general 2019-09-15 10:41:19 basic math

general 2019-09-15 10:44:28 <@!370594904268734464> well, cube root of 8 is 2
general 2019-09-15 10:44:34 cuz 2 times 2 times 2 = 8
general 2019-09-15 10:45:07 Logarithms?

general 2019-09-15 11:16:53 I prefer snipping tool.
general 2019-09-15 11:17:44 Is it wrong to use snipping tool?
general 2019-09-15 11:17:50 You can have all your suspicions.
general 2019-09-15 11:22:46 <@456226577798135808> I can barely make a propeller plane, dude.
general 2019-09-15 11:24:00 I'm playing another game rn
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:00:02 That's sick looking.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:14:30 Rocket Plane with wheels, you drive forwards with the wheels, disconnect them when you feel like it and you get a full rocket plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:14:46 Gamers
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:14:53 I made a rocket-car-plane thing.

plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:17:19 What rank should i go for
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:17:36 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:21:01 What are the tier 2 ranks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:21:47 Should i go for designer 1 rank as i've gotten 3 upvotes on my builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:22:35 designer 2 actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:22:40 my propeller plane got 7 upvotes
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:24:25 Rocket Plane lifting off just after detatching legs (i put the rockets in on and off only mode so yeah)
Requested Rank: Designer 2 (got 7 upvotes on propeller plane thing)
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:24:53 Oh
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:04 Why does nobody tell me these things?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:15 <@456226577798135808> Why do you need an uncropped image, though?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:46 Okay.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:26:42 Is infinite fuel considered cheating?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:27:27 Uncropped image, you can see one of the detatched wheels + the rocket plane flying
Requested role: Designer 2 (7 upvotes on propeller plane)
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:00 It's a bit low quality due to my print screen commiting robloc + desktop
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:23 But anyway, is there anything bad about it?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:27 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:55 Yes.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:30:23 Okay so i can't be satisfied at my beginner creations now, i know its a square with wings and engines, do you expect beginners to be able to make the RMS Titanic except it can become a tank?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:30:30 <@!267393167228141568>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:31:08 Exactly, let me be proud of my own little creations, no need to come in being captain obvious.
Sorry, i'm a bit mad rn and youre forgiven
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:32:22 I'm afraid to ping a moderator to get the designer 2 role, i don't want the mods to rage at me.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:33:20 wdym
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:33:39 so i @ a mod but idk what i ask the mod
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:03 Also where do you get the "i read the rules" rule
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:31 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:33 i mean role
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:44:06 I have no legs.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:48:26 Do i NEED to request ranks?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:49:30 Also i don't get why people downvote creations for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:09 Question
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:14 do you NEED to request roles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:32 Why do you?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:39 Do you get banned or something if you don't?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:46 like
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:48 is it mandatory
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:06:56 is the entirety of the role request optional
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:07:05 do you HAVE to request roles every creation
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:07:07 Ah, i see.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:07:12 I have sparked up some toxicity.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:07:39 <@!221487880487436288> Please talk to me when you learn not to be toxic immediately, thank you.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:07:52 I like to talk to people in a civil manner, like a big brained person.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:08:27 It's kinda feeling as if you are breaking this rule.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:08:57 Also, if you're going to make an argument, please actually check your text with grammar.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:09:14 If only there was a roblox community that wasn't toxic as hell.
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:09:27 Why is it a rule, though?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:09:41 If nobody cares about the rule? Why enforce it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 21:09:59 <@!221487880487436288> <#384025409945337856>, i already have
