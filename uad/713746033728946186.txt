creations-chat 2022-07-15 21:43:46 Is Iron Cross (that symbol on german tanks) banned on this server?
creations-chat 2022-07-15 21:46:09 <@723419054114865202>  Ok, thanks
creations-chat 2022-07-29 17:34:17 ive made a tank, but turret doesnt rotate properly, ive checked multiple times and it does not collide anywhere.  Can anyone help?
creations-chat 2022-07-29 17:36:21 how can i fix it?
creations-chat 2022-07-29 17:49:37 Would changing some blocks for helium blocks help?
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 22:36:34 I hope there will be wing-ground effect in PC2
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 22:37:11 google it
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 22:39:12 I just want to build ekranoplan
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 22:51:24 How the hell did we get from wing-ground effect to this?

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:04:18 Will there be cutters in PC2? Please Rick if you see this message dont add them, they have no real use in fair pvp and are extremely easy  to exploit. If you want them for building, please add double wedge instead.  Please guys, help me get this message to dev team.
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:09:54 I hope they will at least fix that blacklist exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:15:37 not if you use blacklist exploits which most cutter users do
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:18:43 bro why are you toxic? Im just pointing on a problem?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:19:29 You used my rank to insult me, bro you are childish
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:20:23 I was just talking about a problem that can do a giant mess on pvp servers
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:21:17 so people who blacklist you and fly through your builds with cutter plane are not a problem? They anihilate your whole build in one go usingan exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:21:45 Blacklist exploit? HEllo?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:23:18 normally yes, but im not talking about normal use of cutters. That thing can be exploited so easily and can be so OP
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:24:06 Ye you can run from them but it is just annoying
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:25:17 how do you want to boom and zoom a thing that goes 2000 and can phase through builds?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:25:36 Blaclkist exploits
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:25:50 They do if they use blacklist exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:25:55 if you maybe listened
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:26:19 I said it like 20 times that im talking about blacklist exploitation
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:27:36 only thing they cant hit are planes, they render anything else unplayable
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:28:48 because playing planes all the time gets boring
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:29:27 ships are fun untill you get bombed repeatedly by some dumbass in A10
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:29:59 thanks i did not think about that
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:30:07 same problem
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:30:28 in case you didnt know submarine pvp is most slow and boring thing in the game
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 11:31:16 you do, submarines are slow so if they find you and remember your position you are screwed
bot-central 2023-07-18 11:34:28 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:41:11 Im very sorry guys but I have to chat a bit more to get lvl 3
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:44:52 Last time I had peopel were toxic for no reason :/
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:45:24 I just pointed out an issue and some dude called me out cuz i have white name XD
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:45:44 then said that It wAs A jOkE
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:46:08 blacklist exploiting
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:46:47 Basically you blaclkist someone so you can phase through his build and then you put cutters on jet and fly in his builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:47:24 It makes cutters infinitely more effective
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:48:08 Instead of bouncing of the build you go through and completely destroy it in matter of seconds
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:48:22 if you think so, i didnt find it funny
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:49:05 Maybe it would be funny if you didnt say Shut up white name
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:49:19 you could say something less toxic and more creative
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:49:50 and toxic
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:54:18 Just chat more until you reach lvl 3
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:55:33 ye I too havent reached lvl 3 yet, I want to show my tank and apply for rank
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:56:23 tell me something i dont know
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 12:56:41 finally someone useful
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 13:10:39 Thanks dude
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:15:59 I would say 5 to 7 blocks wide, depends on which version you build. Is it the truck based one or that on  tracked GM-352 chassis?
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:22:04 Another of your jokes?
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:24:07 I was just asking man, no need to get jumpy so quick
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:05:26 you have to be lvl3
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:06:48 and what are you building?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:07:26 how fast is it?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:08:11 nice

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:11:53 people with red names act like if name colour had anything to od with skills, only matter is how long you have been active on server for
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:12:56 When I get to lvl 3  i will apply for Terrain designer III (hopefully IV if i get enough points)
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:13:22 I cant post images
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:14:00 oh
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:18:11 You think 3,5k block landcruiser (giant tank) wiht full interior will get enough upvotes for terrain specialist IV?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 14:18:27 I could send you image to DMs if you want to judge

help 2023-07-18 15:36:12 How does the scoring system for creations work? Is score of twenty like 28 upvotes and 8 downvotes?
help 2023-07-18 15:45:42 I get that but how is the score counted? Is it just the number of upvotes or number of upvotes minus number of downvotes?
help 2023-07-18 17:57:24 thanks
