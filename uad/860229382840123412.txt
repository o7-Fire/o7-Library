bug-reports 2022-04-30 16:53:26 I havnt taken any screenshots yet, but when I damage someone's creation sometimes it freezes in place while only a couple blocks are still moving. Damaging the frozen creation doesn't do anything...

plane-crazy 2022-04-30 20:21:44 Once I made a plane that had over 50 bombs motor locked into a 1 block space. When i would drop the bombs my plane would flip out

Honestly it's a stupid question but I'm getting a majority of dislikes on my builds and was wondering, what do you guys look for in creations? What should I do differently?
general 2022-05-30 01:13:57 I don't think plane crazy 2 will ever come out
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 16:30:08 Will plane crazy 2 ever come out?

plane-crazy 2022-12-02 23:57:35 (hopefully)
general 2022-12-21 00:04:01 Who here knows how to script and can help me?
general 2022-12-21 00:06:09 ya I have an issue with raycastin so its a bit advanced
general 2023-04-23 20:48:44 So its been like 4 months since last pc2 update, is it still in development?
general 2023-04-23 20:49:33 Why is the last update for it 4 moths ago?
general 2023-04-23 20:50:09 I wish he would communicate these things, it's a shame pc2 aint happening
general 2023-04-23 20:50:18 Is he still updating plane crazy?
general 2023-04-23 20:51:02 ngl if he aint gonna work on it, then why not transfer ownership to a different dev?
general 2023-04-23 20:51:45 ya so then he should just transfer ownership, to keep things alive
general 2023-04-23 20:53:29 I dare someone to ping rick and ask him about plane crazy
general 2023-04-23 20:55:55 <@217336009455566848> This is a serious question, and I doubt your going to respond. But are you going to transfer ownership of plane crazy? Since plane crazy is a great game and still 1000s of people play it everyday, and I think everyone here feels that it make sense to try to find someone who would want to update the game and what not
general 2023-04-23 20:56:17 no pleaseee
general 2023-04-23 20:56:42 I took a risk ahh
