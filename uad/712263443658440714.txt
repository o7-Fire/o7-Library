plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:59:30 map is alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:00:51 train tracks take up quarter of the map
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:01:04 well i guess you can make your own traintracks
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:01:40 more tracks = more space to test suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:12:49 there should be a toggle option to smokepipes so we can turn it off
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:23:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:23:33 same thing should be for trails
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 06:21:56 gjsolo whould be proud of you

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:54:37 and i mean the one in wedges category not in half blocks category
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:55:15 nvm just use a half wedge down and a half block
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:55:37 then do it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:53:22 would making a creation that lags yourself be against the rules?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:54:11 so why is it? against the rules to lag your self
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:54:35 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:55:37 well i guess i can make a toggable lag machine that lags my self
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:55:45 using pistons and motors
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:56:15 just use tnt tank or fast plane then ez
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:56:31 and no one uses pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:57:04 fine they do
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:57:12 but mostly noobs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 03:22:56 what should i build im bored
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 09:30:06 who the frick said to upgrade a shredder and then say its an "lightsaber"
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:30:47 that isn't low effort it'll take a while to fill the entire plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:31:33 they should've used hoverthrusters for the design instead of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:32:04 you can paint the circles on the thrusters individuallity
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:32:16 making for more detail
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:32:26 like extra shade or make a circle
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:32:43 well i mean thrusters are going to be way better
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:32:57 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:01 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:11 shredder noob in the backround
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:19 why not
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:26 he could've spent 2 hours on that
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:39 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:33:45 nvm its low effort
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:34:05 ima commit pixel artist rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:34:48 private servers are down?
bot-central 2021-04-14 03:34:53 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:35:19 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:58:04 hoverthrusters are underrated and versitle
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:01:25 bruh people only use them for hover vechicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:01:39 not for stuff like doors and pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:01:51 therefore underrated
creations-chat 2021-04-14 05:12:54 anything to improve on my pixel art the picture is slightly innaccurate to ingame due to some stuff idk about i used hoverthrusters instead of blocks for details
creations-chat 2021-04-14 05:26:27 used hoverthrusters for extra detail and the picture is a bit different to ingame because image quality is there anything to make the image better
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:27:38 its not your build it was my build that was next to yours because hoverthrusters lag alot
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:38:23 btw anyway i can improve this pixel art https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/831758896338042900/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:41:24 i just made it to work out how to pixel art in this game. i made some weird gradient circle
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 05:42:08 and used hover thrusters for extra details because the circles in them are 4 times smaller than a block so i can add more detail
creations-chat 2021-04-14 06:56:03 imagine no feedback https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/831758899447201812

plane-crazy 2021-04-14 08:35:42 k
creations-chat 2021-04-14 09:43:48 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:50:38 pixel art with hover thrusters then pro
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:51:56 4 times the density = more plot space = more detail = better art
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:52:11 then i gues
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:52:42 i get it im not saying that non pixel artist are noobs im saying that pixel art is ez way get pro gamer
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:53:10 0
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:53:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:54:05 just delete pvp mode then ez

plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:58:55 i only really used first person mode on glitched mouse builds or turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:06:04 make it a harmless laser and a laser detector because then plane crazy can be more technical
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:06:26 a pvp lazer would be too op and spammable
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:07:34 add quarter blocks(blocks which are twice as small as a halfblock and being 1x1 studs)
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:08:37 well i mean we can also add lazer detectors to detect lazers to power stuff
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:37:00 spam smoke pipes for extra visibility

bot-central 2021-07-09 06:29:38 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:40:08 fun fact: 20 studs = 1 meter
1 block = 2 studs tall

meaning that most of your builds are the height of your hips or even your knee

its proven by this equation 

Gravity in roblox is 196.2 studs/s^2
 (you can find this out by putting print(workspace.Gravity) in the studio command bar)

Gravity on earth is ~9.81 meters/s^2

(196.2stud/s^2) / (9.81 * meter/s^2) = 20stud/meter
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:41:39 its probs different since pc gravity is 180
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:42:40 its a measurement in roblox lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:43:42 i copied and pasted the equation i have little idea what i means
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:52:46 how frick you change the earth's gravity so much that the block is that fat
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:52:53 you god?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:53:43 roblox's gravity never changed so the measurement is the same ez
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:54:14 they use it to cover up that there "realistic avatars" are the size of legos
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:55:35 explain https://blog.roblox.com/2012/06/testing-the-accuracy-of-roblox-physics-with-potato-cannons/
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:56:18 that dev post was 2 years ago several people replied to it with different answers
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:57:47 roblox gravity has stayed the same for years still valid
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 07:58:09 kk im bored ima play some roblox game
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:02:28 > I think there’s finally a canon answer
> 

thinking is not the same as a definite answer. gravity has been the same for 8 years so its a definite answer
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:03:00 ik but even then it wouldn't be .8 meters
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:04:06 your equation has unexplained numbers like where you get the 14 from <@!707953054489509978>
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:05:56 that just proves my point 

Gravity in roblox is 196.2 studs/s^2 ofc

Gravity on earth is ~9.81 meters/s^2

(196.2stud/s^2) / (9.81 * meter/s^2) = 20stud/meter
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:07:10 crap
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:07:13 uhh
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:07:28 press classic button
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:08:23 kk ill wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:09:38 its literilly 1 line lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:09:53 faster than waiting for settings
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:10:20 ima just wait for his pc to load so i can ez parry his argument
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:13:28 im tired of waiting so ima say this the jump hieght is not equal to the jump power. the power of the jump would be 50 studs or 14 meters per second but the jump height is smaller than 14 meters
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:13:57 kk ill wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:26:42 2012 data came from roblox 
2018 data came from some guy on the internet idk which is more trust worthy
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:27:31 devforum*
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:30:29 kk?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:32:17 smh when it says 50 = 14 meters that means that a robloxian jumps as high as a human jumping 14 meters meaning that they are high jumpers
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:32:29 gravity applies to both parties
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:33:56 the different gravites can be converted by (robloxgame gravity/s^2) / (earths gravity * meter/s^2)
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:34:55 we find it out via gravity
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:35:37 its like saying that an ant runs fast as a cheetah for its body mass so that means a ant runs fast as a cheetah
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:41:23 kk so (180.2stud/s^2) / (9.81 * meter/s^2)  = 11607339.4
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:41:40 took some time so now i gotta make it a fraction brb
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:42:42 i assume
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:46:32 i guess?
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:48:29 but isn't your just how high the robloxian can jump
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:49:20 he found it out from some guy on the dev forum
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:50:01 i guess lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:50:26 i'd just stick to 1 stud per meter
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:51:06 i agree
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 09:28:21 just make the engine spin faster lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 09:28:44 gear ratios are your friend

creations-chat 2022-01-07 08:38:16 snow blasters are kinda hard to colour in so ima go with hover thrusters.

plane-crazy 2022-01-08 10:55:50 wow
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 10:57:51 when you want to get expert but your build is unsaved with only like 64 parts and doesn't go into a category 😭
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:07:24 true
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:07:42 i didn't even save the build 😭
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:13:32 and then theres shredder balls
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:13:49 tbh the only good shredder builds are the ones not from tutorials

plane-crazy 2022-01-09 01:08:16 probs
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 05:10:10 hover thrusters kinda suck at diagonal lines, would probally need to go 16 x 16 blocks to actually get good diagonal lines
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 05:10:49 curved and straight lines are somehow good on very small sizes like 4x4 blocks
