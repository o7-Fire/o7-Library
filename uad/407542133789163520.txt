general 2022-04-04 12:16:39 Inventing in this game = finding new glitches
general 2022-04-04 17:11:04 I'm so confused
general 2022-04-04 17:11:09 Why do I have some pontoons
general 2022-04-04 17:11:11 But not all of them
general 2022-04-04 17:11:54 What
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:14:50 Why do I have some Pontoons
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:14:52 But not the rest
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:14:57 Like, I have front pontoons
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:01 But no middle parts
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:03 Nothing
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:46 Damn, cause it's really messing with me
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:50 I wanna build something round
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:55 But I have four pontoons
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:15:59 And not the rest
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:16:21 Any way to fix it?
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:18:38 Is this a bug, or am I just stupid. Because there's no reason I'd have 4 types of Pontoons and not the other who knows how many
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:18:58 Did you have to collect them seperate or what?
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:20:14 And I'm pretty sure it's been like this for a long time, I just never really cared because I didn't need them at that time
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:27 I only have 4 for some reason
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:36 I want to start actually using them but I can't
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:40 I literally have the frotns
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:50 I'm asking if it's a bug or did you have to collect each one
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:24:34 I don't have that many
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:25:35 Checking
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:25:38 Idk what to look for
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:26:06 
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:26:36 I'm so confused on why I have only four
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:12 Also how will that help
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:41 Ok but I still can't get what I need from it
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:45 I can't just fix the script
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:30:14 I already rejoined, and I mentioned the issue persisting for a while
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:24 Oh, I actually think it was multiple
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:29 My bad then
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:37 Still stupid they made it like that though
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:39 What's the point
general 2022-04-04 21:25:11 How I be playing this game for like 2 years and still be dog doo doo at building
