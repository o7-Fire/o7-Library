plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:50:54 
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:51:18 maybe a bit to long i think

creations-chat 2022-06-10 10:07:34 Hi guy i made this mini f16 but when i fly it inverted and try to go up it does this
How can i fix this
creations-chat 2022-06-10 11:56:01 its   more for pvp so smal is better
general 2022-06-14 07:48:37 ‚Äé
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:42:01 Anyone thinks its possible to make working Ground effect aircraft
No hover thrusters
No proppels or other engine for pitch
Vector thurust allowed.
No helium
It may not fly normaly
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:45:59 if you play with thurst amount and vector thust and ballast in back it might be
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:46:51 but yeah the water place is to smal atm to try it
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:47:07 hoping for the second game inf water map
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:48:35 But yeah i'm gonna experimentate with it
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:50:10 ikr but if you  have just enough airspeed to fly and not climb it may be possible
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:51:11 proppelor
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:51:35 that thing used for heli's
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:54:48 yeah if u experimentate with a staying elevator/control service it may be possible also
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:56:00 its just the combination thats hard to find out
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:58:13 Yeah  but in pc2 its possible to glide to  maybe that also a change to get it working
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:58:54 nope
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:59:13 yeah bit bit but bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 08:00:02 yeah but you slow down to fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 08:02:13 thats the  problem with hover engines you cant fly slower if needed  we just dont keep the speed when you disable your engine
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 08:03:52 but yeah if  gliding is better in pc2 we can also make the ww2 glider work nicely
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 08:06:06 we wil see
