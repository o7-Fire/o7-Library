general 2021-08-07 17:46:46 finally verified
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:21:01 so im realtivly good at making a wide array of basic planes but want to know what is a good thing to make to step it up a level
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:22:03 hum.... ill look into tutorials for that
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:23:17 it isnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:23:43 im gonna try building a basic converyer belt engine fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:25:51 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:28:41 Chilling in vc
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:31:27 My guy <@683338279117914132> please don't scream in the vc I'm wanting to talk to players
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:32:41 Aight thanks for not screaming
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:37:30 I'll try making a small hover jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:38:51 Shouldn't be that bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:02:11 Weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:02:15 But cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:04:50 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:05:13 How small can I make a fighter with a hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:07:43 And can you aim guns with motor2 to shoot at where your mouse is pointing
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:08:40 So
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:08:48 If they all are arranged in a cross
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:09:12 One above one below one left and one right
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:12:22 They all can shoot at the center
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:19:49 So if i wanna have em follow the mouse and all hit in one spot do I just need motor 2s or some fancy stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:26:02 What's the music
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:26:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:33:57 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:34:24 I'm gonna try to make a focus point gunner
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:34:37 So
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:34:50 Idea is gun on each wing tip and top and bottom
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:35:06 That can focus on the center where the mouse points
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:35:14 I think I just need motor 2 for it right
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:39:27 Can someone give me a design idea for a multi gun thing that follows the mouse pointer
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:41:00 So
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:41:08 Motor 2 on motor 2 on gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:41:24 Also ciws?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:42:22 So
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:42:34 It's not super hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:42:36 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:14:51 Nice build
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:37:30 So collective question
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:37:39 How much do y'all hate shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:39:04 I'm gonna try to make a shotgun plane that's just destroys shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:39:57 So anyway
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:40:06 What's the easiest way to nullify a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:40:23 I manage to out manuver them
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:40:28 Also null zone?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:40:47 You mean death barrier?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:10 I'd say
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:18 Don't compare it to MPH
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:22 Compare it to knots
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:29 OOOO
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:33 Yeah that
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:40 How far out is that
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:41:53 Yeah I've seen that with parachute
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:44:19 Yah know what they should add to the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:44:26 Undo button
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:44:34 Like undo last block
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:44:46 Instead of go into a different menu
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:06 Also
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:19 Nerf shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:25 I think it's kinda a problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:30 But keep the glitches
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:50 Also
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:45:59 What is the fastest engine type
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:07 Magnet or hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:12 True
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:19 But skill can only do so much
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:23 Hover is fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:37 I love my hover fighter I made recently
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:45 Gave it swiveling weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:46:56 It can function as a bomber to
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:47:49 Still I enjoy the amogus plane it literally is a tnt plane that lands on carries with a paint job of imposter
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:49:24 Also
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:49:46 Can you make motor2 follow someone's mouse in your plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:49:58 Like have a pilot and a gunner
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:50:01 Sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:34:02 Yo
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:34:26 I gotta strap that scatter cannon to a plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:34:38 Anti shredder bug gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:44:34 Should I make a shredder that looks like a bug or a bug that looks like a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:44:57 Understandable
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:46:59 Those wings my guy
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:51:31 Gonna try to make some new plane to be anti shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:51:34 Cause why not
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:31:06 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:31:35 One sec

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:56:24 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:56:58 Trying to craft a plane that can out manuver planes that can go upside down and fast in combat
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:57:15 Seems like they are becoming an annoying present
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:57:24 But it's not hard to deal with
