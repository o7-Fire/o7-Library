plane-crazy 2022-01-30 04:14:07 I just used a tutorial to make it but I think the sound was from the propellers

general 2022-03-27 02:51:08 I wonder if our builds from plane crazy 1 will go to plane crazy 2
general 2022-03-27 02:51:51 Will there atleast be a copy and paste tool
general 2022-03-27 02:52:03 Well frick
general 2022-03-27 02:52:52 I built an entire army and added a second floor for other things so<:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-03-27 02:54:12 I also built dozens of things involving hundreds of blocks
general 2022-03-27 02:54:57 If I want all of my builds to be in plane crazy 2 I have to copy them one by one block by block
general 2022-03-27 02:55:45 There is also that snake I made that involves 600 blocks
general 2022-03-27 02:55:53 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-03-27 02:56:23 What are you a judge?
general 2022-03-27 02:57:17 It’s a pattern it doesn’t use normal blocks
general 2022-03-27 02:58:31 Still it’s actually somewhat good for destroying people by running into them
general 2022-03-27 02:58:52 Wait you think I’m using a shredder?
general 2022-03-27 03:00:03 You just said “shredder bug<:empty:794431705070174238> “ what am I supposed to say to that
general 2022-03-27 03:02:33 Of the snake you mean?

general 2022-03-27 03:18:12 Atleast it isn’t a shredder lol
general 2022-03-27 03:19:17 Wait why would you reply in 5 seconds
general 2022-03-27 03:20:18 The last time you said something was like 8 minutes ago and then when I reply to you you replied to me in 5 seconds
