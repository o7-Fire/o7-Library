plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:38:31 nah thats a lot my friend
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:38:41 mine is a destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:38:49 i have yet to put an interior
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:39:03 but.. i have an ammunition locker
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:39:17 you know what?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:39:22 they should add torpedos
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:40:02 my ship got no room for custom torpedos
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:40:10 and rockets blow up when they touch the water, effectively destroying the hull of my ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:41:51 i dont make torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:41:59 i just make the rockets above the waterline

plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:43:34 my ship wasnt meant for pvp lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:43:40 it was for looks
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:44:45 i have a few ideas for the next update: torpedos, larger map, water physics, helicopter rotors, tank treads (lag reasons), and rudders
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:45:21 (thats a lot I am asking for)
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:46:34 actually?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:46:41 actually a map in the works?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 17:46:47 yay

creations-chat 2020-09-24 16:56:52 ive had that question for a long time
bot-central 2020-09-26 01:54:20 &suggest Add a precision coloring tool. For example, you have a wedge 1x4 but you only need to color 1/4 of the wedge. Then you can select precision coloring and it allows for you to color that certain unit you need colored. It allows for better camp paint jobs and straight waterlines.

creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:14:05 it has dual purpose guns too
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:14:23 (the issue is the front turret might jam)
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:15:11 well, the ratte can take a lot of hits bc conveyor tracks but also it can lose a gun easily
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:15:28 which is never good news
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:15:47 something that spins i guess
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:16:07 i mean hey it spins
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:16:27 100% functional
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:17:27 the game should have sensors
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:18:14 thatll take a year to soft code it
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:19:13 tiger vs mech
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:19:30 specifically Alittude_Alex's mech vs my Tiger I

creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:25:40 thats me when i get pinged too many times
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:27:36 rick can get madattack to work with him
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:28:40 ik but he said that if he softcodes the game hes gonna see if madattack wants to do it

creations-chat 2020-10-15 14:09:17 its gonna be like scp containment facilities with the keter (heavy), euclid (medium), and safe (light) containment levels
creations-chat 2020-10-15 14:47:13 a swashplate is a helicopter rotor system. all you need to know
creations-chat 2020-10-15 14:52:38 ello Rookie'
creations-chat 2020-10-15 14:57:52 read the suggestions log the reason is there
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:02:53 rip prinz eugen. it was a good cruiser
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:04:45 t-80 but somethings... wrong???
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:05:51 no i have a 2 hour break between 2nd period and 5th period bc i have no classes for periods 3-4 for Monday, Tuesday-Friday
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:08:16 i have a science lab like every single week. This week is isolines
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:10:14 they be kinda easy ngl
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:11:25 my teachers sometimes let us go 5-20 minutes early. some even let us 30 minutes early since lessons are short
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:13:01 use motor treads or use conveyor treads but thats unrealistic
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:14:18 use motor treads the surround the front and back wheels. use suspension on the front and rear pair of wheels to have a tighter treads and an absorber for head on collisions with stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:26:56 hmmm this person is the only one that downvoted me
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:28:01 do you ever wonder if physics in plane crazy are even there. also nothing im just thinking about whether i should respect the downvote or just ignore it
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:29:54 k i respect haeman's downvote by the fact he has 3 expert things
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:31:55 water doesn't have the ability to sink ships, planes immediately decelerate to like no speed after 1 second of losing thrust, planes don't roll far down the runway after landing. you tell me if the game lacks some physics.
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:32:58 i dont like jojo? whats your point. i don't even watch anime.
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:34:23 oi you don't know if he watches anime or not. I just like to see if its just random downvoting or downvoting that makes some sort of sense
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:36:10 in 2 minutes i go to class
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:37:28 it would be cool (in my opinion) if you added side torpedoes to be honest
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:40:14 should i make a uboat ive been thinking for a while now
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:10:35 i finished 5th period. now i wait 13 minutes

creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:25:19 ev1 hates self upvote ðŸ˜ 
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:26:55 use ball bearings on the motors to make motor suspension. my suspension for my tiger 1 is all motors (i don gufed up)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:28:24 so the motor should not be powered and everything on lowest. that makes it loose
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:29:25 however it looks extremely complicated, especially for overlapping road wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:31:21 image.exe isnt loading

creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:04:45 upscale a tank turret but still has a dual gun setup lol
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:40:24 custom jet engines tend to get... too big

creations-chat 2020-10-21 12:58:35 the Prinz Eugen (WW2)

creations-chat 2020-10-21 13:04:59 ok hold on
creations-chat 2020-10-21 13:06:32 what about the Tinconderoga Class

creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:27:00 Iâ€™m sure <@456226577798135808> has heard of SMS_Kaiser or kxrkv before
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:29:48 Should I make the USS Iowa? After my completed out of scale Bismarck was done I wanted a new battleship.
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:31:05 I would but thatâ€™s some low effort build just writing yes
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:46:50 does anyone have an apocalyptic build?

creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:59:24 mass downvoting is ---- (you can fill in the blanks)
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:02:03 its a problem. just because you don't like it doesn't mean you downvote it. When you downvote, you tell them that something is bad about the build, not "oh I just don't like it" <@!480746414293647360> I dont think i will
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:04:08 server mod is here
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:08:20 i see such a big problem. I don't think many shipbuilders or people that build large builds in general  including me (I dont have the role but I do build ships) like your stance that just bc you don't like it you downvote it.
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:09:31 oh, yes sir!
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:10:53 cant lie i agree but sometimes its too much lol

1) People don't personally like them
2) Mass downvoters
3) Doesn't look as good as it could be (i.e. details)
creations-chat 2020-12-24 19:25:59 Yea that nose isn't that good. Also, you should make custom jet engines and start adding smaller details

creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:08:05 looking through his creations history in <#384025409945337856>, his builds are definitely below standards and I've seen many others in public servers do better.

creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:31:18 true true

creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:08:42 are we not gonna talk about how this is obviously the madvulpen a-10 warthog tutorial?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 01:11:36 The hull is the exact same and so is the turret. The only REAL difference is the machine gun but it makes it a tutorial still. To prove that it is a tutorial, I met someone in another server with the same tank. This server isnâ€™t dumb and we know it is a tutorial. Never post a tutorial here or the community is gonna rip you apart, which Iâ€™ve seen as NOT FUN. If you do, well have fun with the community lol
creations-chat 2021-07-13 01:13:39 Itâ€™s not fun for them but it certainly is fun for everyone else watching the shitshow go down
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:58:23 <@!642324788429324301> In real life, both sides make upward thrust but one is producing less upwards force so that might fix your problem? Cuz in ur drawing of thrust produced one side is producing downward force rather than some upward force. i mean unless im reading it wrong
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:30:10 I don't feel its particularly good and i dont want ppl to think im gonna blast em for downvoting
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:33:21 Tank heavily inspired by the Centurion and its long because I can't place 2 2x2 wheels closer together
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:35:55 Then the turret would be too large and I don't want to go through designing the gun again
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:38:16 Maybe if there was a way to place wheels closer without motor lock i would do it
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:40:20 you see placing 5 wheels would make it **too short** ill try it rn
creations-chat 2021-08-22 20:49:02 turret is wayy to big and doesnt looks good
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:31:59 How can I improve dis thingy
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:00:40 Fixed the weird hole in the wing closest to the body, the other hole is for the gear. The fabric gives the olive drab a darker color but I'll play around with the materials. Also, if the colors are "weird", then what colors do you recommend?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:03:09 What "80 80 80" color and if you didn't mean what I think you meant, where on the front should "80 80 80" be

creations-chat 2021-08-29 17:00:54 Mixed opinions on my plane go brrrrr (and no feedback from them sadly)
creations-chat 2021-10-17 00:30:18 basic minimal motor lock bf-109 or stuka
creations-chat 2021-10-17 22:41:03 this is quite inefficient
creations-chat 2021-10-17 22:54:30 ship building often takes 3-4 parts so-
creations-chat 2021-10-17 22:58:42 r u tryna build half a ship or an entire ship
creations-chat 2021-10-17 23:00:47 yes u can use 2 accounts but fr u can only fold one other part if u use that method (2 other parts if you really tried)
creations-chat 2021-11-13 23:59:09 imo its not that great (personal opinion dont take it to seriously)
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:02:55 it looks kinda... plain if thats how you can put it. the bow def needs a more conventional design cuz a flat tipped bow isnt that great (you can ask excellent shipbuilders like ICommitWarCrimes1 for that), get rid of the missile (or make it smaller and hidden), turrets definitely need a visual rework to make it less blocky, and maybe a bit more of a conventional superstructure
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:04:57 to be fair i made a pretty garbage ship without motor lock (you can find it in creations somewhere) with a 28-8 ratio so i dont think motor lock is required
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:16:12 cuz that actually looks pretty good
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:27:37 with this reasoning whyd u upvote my p51 mustang exactly?

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:31:20 hmmm ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:32:38 actually i do it occasionally its not an irregular thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:33:43 i also have a nightmare build that i never completed
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:34:11 gave me 3 hours of trying to fix it (motor locks) not working properly
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:34:48 here lemme get the msg link

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:38:45 making serial numbers for roblox is a nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:40:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:41:05 no wait that build wasnt a nightmare to make
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:41:12 i have another one that gave me a headache
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:41:32 and ofc it wasnt worth it
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:42:36 (please help me im going mentally insane from motor lock)
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:43:57 powerful enough to be a searchlight
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:44:16 woah an inventor
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:44:22 dont see many of those around
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:44:46 what did you invent
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:45:02 damn
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:45:07 thats pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:45:50 literal embodiment of "throw things at the wall until it sticks"
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:15 im gonna build a tank with an interesting armor system
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:51:40 i 100% do not approve
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:52:16 to be fair its possible but its impractical and pretty much trash
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:53:12 wait doesnt water wheel also do that
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:53:45 well no you'd need a motor to but even then its impossible to control turn rate without a motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:12 certified cool
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:55:26 visual aspect
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:57:48 build a completely new one but this time make it look better
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:09:59 most importantly: what unit

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:01:33 sorry to dwarf this but...
credits to TankCrazier (mans made this thing)
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:02:34 to be fair its probably to get the gun mantlet working

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:08:36 i mean the gun wasnt **that** offset to the right
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:09:45 plane crazy cylinders be messing with me
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:11:23 dont be adding zimmermit
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:11:29 its a waste of time

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:23:17 smol boi
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:23:37 ya know, havent seen a tank collab build in a long time
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:24:25 which one
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:25:15 if u said vk 45.03 you'd be slightly correct but not correct
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:26:18 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:26:27 thats another vk 45
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:26:29 hold on

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:32:32 yea they dont show the cupola well
general 2021-11-14 02:33:05 br
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:33:19 i swear to god every single build i post has a mixed response
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:33:35 i cant even tell if its actually somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:34:01 why is it that the first thing that came to mind was a track field
general 2021-11-14 02:34:54 ew among us
general 2021-11-14 02:36:27 its not anime thats the funny part
general 2021-11-14 02:36:49 its not anime so this is even funnier
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:37:14 my brain has ceased to exist
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:38:12 help me understand this
general 2021-11-14 02:38:46 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:38:52 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:39:00 the vulpen himself
general 2021-11-14 02:39:13 accept the fact
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:39:40 im gonna go back to talking to tank crazier
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:39:47 instead of vulpen
general 2021-11-14 02:40:00 same difference
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:40:27 thats one good carrier
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:40:55 (if you couldnt tell i have low requirements for ships)
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:41:16 ok thats actually accurate then
general 2021-11-14 02:41:28 alr then peace
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:41:46 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:41:50 its annoying to build
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:42:12 ships are those things that require a lot of dedication
general 2021-11-14 02:42:46 you need a lesson in shipbuilding good sir
general 2021-11-14 02:45:12 aww a ca- wait why is it on fire
general 2021-11-14 02:45:30 save the cat
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:45:50 who

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:47:44 its too much to process
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:49:13 ok
general 2021-11-14 02:51:33 look who it is
general 2021-11-14 02:53:25 its spam
general 2021-11-14 02:55:48 bro i received a random friend request
general 2021-11-14 02:56:10 mans is a real person but aint online
general 2021-11-14 02:56:15 so idk
general 2021-11-14 02:56:37 ill leave it hanging there <:sunglasses:856850752319520780>

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:57:41 idk if my eyes are abouta die
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:57:47 but my eyes probably are
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:58:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:58:57 most jets are motor lock hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:59:02 jets/planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:59:26 oh no
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 02:59:56 i mean depends on how much hell you put into it
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:00:05 my p51 doesnt have motor lock hell cuz its simple
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:01:04 probably more hell than my plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:01:33 i mean thats a lot of hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:01:42 but just rens' hell is... quite literally hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:01:55 oh dear
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:02:21 thats as compact as he can get it
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 03:04:43 Wipeout
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:57:31 "sketchy"
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:58:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:58:31 even though not all pvp builds have to look like crap
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:58:55 cuz this is the pcc discord
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:58:58 and we have standards here
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:59:24 no no we have standards
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:59:28 so if u make a crap build
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 15:59:35 ur gona get rekt by the community
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:00:09 once u put a good build up there
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:00:17 any trash build after that is all downhill
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:01:52 rust go brrrrr
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:11:56 except people with medium -> high ranks
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:53:45 who
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:54:05 bro leaks are classified (/j)
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:55:34 /j = joke
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:56:03 twitter in a nutshell:
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:56:30 i havent logged into twitter for 1-2 years now
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 19:30:29 counter it
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 19:31:58 loll
creations-chat 2021-11-28 01:33:04 bro this is about builds not avatars
creations-chat 2021-11-28 01:39:07 right right
creations-chat 2021-11-28 01:41:11 the build is good enough, idc about avatars
creations-chat 2021-11-28 01:43:36 thats what im saying tho
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:12:58 trash build ngl
i had a stroke looking at it too, even the ship i posted a while ago i considered bad is better
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:37:22 i only have high requirements for planes, ships, and tanks
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:39:25 not really, you can look to my simple p51 and it got relatively mixed reviews from expert ranks and other ranks alike or my mediocre tank
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:43:31 feels too plain though, like the top doesnt have much to show
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:46:35 i mean if its big then its gotta be detailed
you could add like empty shell casings or other related equipment
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:51:37 everyone started somewhere, we all didnt start as pros. you can get better, i believe you can :)
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:54:25 not harder, work smarter.
creations-chat 2022-01-08 22:28:46 it doesnt need tracks but in order for it to not need tracks, the wheels need to be wider
creations-chat 2022-08-05 02:17:04 how did i spent 5 hours on this thing
i can definitely tell my 6 month break from plane crazy lowered my skills
creations-chat 2022-08-05 02:19:13 im going to hide the very exposed front motor lock by adding a plow
creations-chat 2022-08-19 00:13:10 guy is dumb (motor lock is more skilled)
bot-central 2022-09-10 00:38:37 -verify BreadBoi_2
creations-chat 2022-09-10 00:57:15 you lagging like hell bro
you sure its happening when its running smoothly too
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:01:48 you running 50-60fps?
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:03:56 its lag but if ur running 50-60 fps then its a different story
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:06:27 had this problem once
add a bit of weight and add more wing panels + control surfaces
it worked for me at least
drawback is you take off unrealistically fast
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:08:36 add some more control surfaces and wing panels
add some weight to the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:10:41 roblox recording makes it look like ur lagging like hell
creations-chat 2022-09-11 18:22:10 they use the squares emoji (black and white ones)
creations-chat 2022-09-11 23:53:29 if you wanted to show some respect 
you would have made the actual monument at the world trade center to actually respect the people who died
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:17:30 <@621246922157457408> the photo doesnt really show much of the detail
can ya show us some more pictures, even if doesnt capture the entire ship
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:28:46 ok so basically i think you shouldnt only use wedges to define the ship's shape
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:31:44 ships generally dont have flat sections with some exceptions 
also dont always rely on horizontal folds, vertical folds can help when you have a ship like yours that generally doesnt have flat sides (more space to work with)
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:38:33 i can give you a not-so-great example (this isnt the current progress but it shows what i mean)
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:40:35 its ok take ur time
shipbuilding takes a long time and also requires good space usage, but you'll get the hang of it
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:42:55 im nowhere near as pro as other shipbuilders because my builds would look trash against theirs
but good luck and have fun :)
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:45:36 motor lock doesnt mean your build is better
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:49:35 also you gotta realize
just cuz you put a lot of effort into a build doesn't mean people will like it, if they don't like something IRL they won't necessarily upvote your build
also dont expect light treatment if you wanna be mad over your build not being popular
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:51:38 take the criticism and downvotes to improve ur build and try again
and if someone is just being a prick then ignore them, no point in wasting ur time in arguing with them
its not that hard to avoid conflicts
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:53:40 dont expect to be treated well if you want to be like that
and especially dont try to suggest ur build is better cuz motorlock
theres unspoken rules that exist here and you broke most of them
creations-chat 2022-09-18 15:55:56 i didnt swear at you or say nasty things when im trying to tell you how to avoid more arguments
if you legit cant deal with me trying to reason with you then just dont come back here cuz clearly you cant take someone being a prick and/or sharing their opinion
creations-chat 2022-09-18 16:02:10 you see i tried but this guy is playing the victim card tryna make me look bad
creations-chat 2022-09-18 23:02:55 you didnt do a good job of managing the situation to be fair
yeah i know im back again
creations-chat 2022-09-18 23:06:37 alright then
good to diffuse and eliminate the situation
creations-chat 2022-09-21 22:13:58 this is low gun
creations-chat 2022-09-21 22:17:36 no no if you think his was terrible
make a better one, hes got a point
creations-chat 2022-09-24 18:22:19 good luck with that
you gotta use multiple accounts
creations-chat 2022-09-26 00:45:07 effort doesnt equate to a good build
i had to scrap many builds that i spent hours and days on because they looked like garbage
also whatever you post is subjected to everyone's opinions, its up to you to take the criticisms/trash talking with a humble approach
creations-chat 2022-09-26 00:54:07 you know...
average is really down there
creations-chat 2022-09-26 00:56:45 no thats below average
creations-chat 2022-09-26 00:58:51 id also be the first to say that my own builds arent that great, not that proud of em
creations-chat 2022-11-16 23:59:52 borderline impossible realistically speaking
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:15:25 oh it actually isnt blue its white
im blind
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:20:36 ever heard of **lock**
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:24:09 piston lock = holds the piston in place after extension (although it doesnt work under extremely high load)
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:27:12 no i meant extremely extremely high loads
for example if you tried to use piston lock for track tensioning on something like a motor tread it wouldn't work
also tryna carry people's builds with a crane is a bad idea because roblox likes to do this thing called bug out and make it phase through
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:29:17 and also how did that build get 200 upvotes
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:31:41 me whos about to put one locked piston against a shit ton of super rockets to see how quickly it shits itself
creations-chat 2022-11-19 18:34:29 <:Piston:564189302741794835> <- time to abuse this poor block
