The Tale of thearcticchill (546813621129314335)
bug-reports 2021-08-12 03:20:13 Dont know if this is a bug thats already reported but when i use jetpack on a wedge (Mainly one thats facing upward) i cant fly up or down
general 2021-10-12 19:00:17 Can anyone agree that Plane Crazy is just plain crazy?
general 2021-11-08 17:59:28 e
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:15:07 just wondering if using "Glitches" like the half piston is ban able because this guy said i can get banned/kicked. i just don't know if he is telling the truth or lying.
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:15:22 oh good

plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:26:00 anyone know roughly how fast a piston goes to a motor bc i am making a mech with pistons and i want the motors to be slightly slower then the pistons
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:37:29 by kicked do you mean like crashing or like a black box that pops up and says "You got kicked for so and so"?
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:38:00 ohh that never happened to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:38:09 the crashes yes but not unexpected client
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 20:39:08 i only crash when i use it and the creation either has ropes on it and i hit a certain part of my creation or just when i hit a certain part
general 2021-12-08 20:27:37 where do i make suggestions?
general 2021-12-08 20:28:05 i meant where do i type them
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 22:22:50 just wonderin but in Plane Crazy 2 is there gonna be stuff like "Mirror Mode" (when you place a block on one side it duplicates it on the other side) or a way to choose what level you want to build on (there is an invisible barrier that can go up and down and you can place blocks in mid-air)

creations-chat 2021-12-14 20:46:25 My samurai good? It kinda needs some touch ups and some spots that need coloring are missing (There are a lot of nooks and crannys)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 20:51:00 I did go off of a reference image and the first actual good picture i seen was a samurai with red and yellow armor and it was in a similar pattern like the one i made but i couldnt find any colors that actually looked good (Im just to lazy to find colors because it takes so much time)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:02:27 https://streamable.com/lxjr2c So i made an ornithopter and im wondering if there is any other way of making a functional one. I just made mine for function and not looks
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:07:19 I found the imposter...
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:11:22 Tonk valid?
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:23:19 https://streamable.com/xfkpih I aint good with jets and this is kinda my first actual "Good" one and i just wanna get some tips on how i can make it look better, fly better, land better , and etc.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:31:16 oh wow i just tried that (I removed all of the motorlock that had the jets on it) and it surprisingly still has the same speed and it looks more clean. I guess more dont actually mean it'l fly faster
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:41:05 https://streamable.com/nvfsq3 My jet is mega cool now, except for the fact that when going at speeds over 1200+ it starts to wobble and get out of control
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:46:37 Never asked for negativity. I just want tips on how to make it better
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:03:26 I redid the wings. It is just hard for me to hide motors (I dont really know how to hide them)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:06:41 Well for the back wings i have roll and pitch because the front wings dont work good with just them having pitch so i put pitch on the back ones also
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:20:10 Does this look better?
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:27:11 https://streamable.com/seqt2b It looks much better but the controllability is much worser is there a design that will work best with the front wings?
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:32:54 https://streamable.com/hqn8oe Of course this is much better then my "actual plane"
bug-reports 2021-12-16 20:24:21 https://streamable.com/drod8p This is probably a known glitch but i dont see it in the pins. So with wedge 1 x 4 and sometimes 1 x 3 the jetpack does not want to work, sometimes with wedge 1 x 2 and 1 x 1 when they are on their side they also make the jetpack not work. The other glitch is that the jetpack makes you slowly go up automatically.
