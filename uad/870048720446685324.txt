creations-chat 2023-02-23 15:06:19 a question, do you also hate it when you click on a board and it keeps editing? without the screwdriver
creations-chat 2023-02-23 15:08:33 you know well that sometimes you can't do that without deleting some block
creations-chat 2023-02-23 15:11:58 aff, I just asked if it was boring for you too, I didn't ask to explain to the clear
creations-chat 2023-02-23 15:51:07 apparently the conversation here is on another level

creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:25:36 /so, there is no button, for some reason it disappears on this channel
help 2023-02-23 17:27:54 there are people without a job like me who also sent images there
help 2023-02-23 17:29:15 ok i understood
help 2023-02-23 17:30:08 if I say something wrong, it's because I'm using the translator to speak English

creations-chat 2023-02-23 18:28:02 wow this is amazing, but is the interior good? because whenever I make naves, balancing the inside with the outside is always a problem
