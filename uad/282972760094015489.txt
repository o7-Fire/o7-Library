creations-chat 2019-12-21 23:25:30 **1958 Plymouth Belvedere**

*What's changed since your **58' Fury?***

- Gave it a well deserved blue coat.
- Gutted interior. (Wasn't really seen.)
- Made tail fins a tad longer.
- Added highbeams.
- Added metal contrast cylinder onto previously existing tire.
- Dimmed tail lights a bit.
- Fixed headlight eyebrows.
- Replaced V on front with text V.
- Reduced part count juristically.
- Made undercarriage and wheel wells better looking.
- Made rear windshield bigger.

*What took so long?*

This car didn't take long at all. The main reason why I changed it is because
I got tired of looking at the same old car. There were a few things that bothered me
so I just changed it all together.

*Anything else?*

Yes, actually, I want to give credit to a few people.

- YieldingAlanpero900 for the new wheel system which you will see in some photos.
- SirFryPanMan for helping me create a new maneuvering system for this car.
- pidosek for helping me plan out the new MS and keeping me motivated. :)))

*Photos*

Here they are. vvv

My issue WAS that the car would oversteer in the air, I fixed that problem easily with some wing panels. The next issue that arisen after is that now my car pitches way too much. Not too fast, but it some times starts pitching up or down depending upon the angle, I need some help fixing that.

creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:32:20 I know.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:32:23 That's the point.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:32:40 Black and white sepia photos don't show color.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:32:50 I wouldn't have done it otherwise.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:33:10 Does it really matter?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:33:23 If I want to take the color away, that's my choice.

creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:37:47 There's no rule that says I have to have my photos in color.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 19:38:10 No, but you're making it seem like it.

plane-crazy 2020-03-21 03:12:12 I've never had this issue before.
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 03:12:32 
help 2020-03-21 03:14:00 So I'm having this weird issue with my propellers on my ship.

Basically, instead of them spinning, they spin the **whole ship.**
help 2020-03-21 03:14:01 
help 2020-03-21 03:14:08 These are correctly placed too.
help 2020-03-21 03:14:12 I'll send a gif.
help 2020-03-21 03:16:20 https://gyazo.com/b964d4b8388a103c0c1aa37dc83f829e
help 2020-03-21 03:16:35 When I slow them down, so does the ship.
help 2020-03-21 03:17:25 Any idea why it does this?
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 03:19:32 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 03:19:33 So
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 03:19:55 rotating the propeller in build mode doesn't do anything, it's just this one that's causing it to freak out.
help 2020-03-21 03:21:19 Alright so I figured out that it's just the center right prop that's causing the spin to occur, but I still don't know why it's doing it.
help 2020-03-21 03:25:25 Nope nevermind, it is ANY.
help 2020-03-21 03:28:17 Nope
help 2020-03-21 03:28:18 Nothing.
help 2020-03-21 03:28:31 I've tried moving them away from the hull, removing the cutter blocks, nothing.
help 2020-03-21 03:28:53 <@456226577798135808>
help 2020-03-21 03:29:04 I seriously have no idea why it's doing this.
help 2020-03-21 03:29:19 I tried to see if air props do the same thing, and they don't.
help 2020-03-21 03:29:27 So it's something with the water propellers.
help 2020-03-21 03:30:44 Same as my discord.
help 2020-03-21 03:31:48 Added.

bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:43:11 2x3 propellers are acting kind of strange.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:43:45 And the some of the larger ones too.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:44:14 We tried a bunch of different methods, moving them, replacing them, rotating them, nothing worked.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:44:39 I don't have this issue on my other ships either.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:45:07 The motors, the rudder, or anything is causing a disturbance, and yet I'm still getting one.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 03:45:45 I'm just going have them remove for now and just finish the ship hoping they'll some how fix themselves.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 04:10:40 nevermind we fixed it
bug-reports 2020-03-21 04:10:43 but still wtf
bug-reports 2020-03-21 04:11:03 we had to copy it to the other side to null it
bug-reports 2020-03-21 04:11:08 now it works as normal

creations-chat 2020-03-21 04:16:53 fine whatever it's not actual major progress anyways
bug-reports 2020-03-21 17:50:41 Same here.
bug-reports 2020-03-21 17:50:47 This is really strange.
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:13:27 ⚓ - *Something new is coming soon...!*
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:52:49 fair, but it could be a bit wider
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:53:09 im assuming you're using helium in the masts to keep it stable?
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:54:04 well, having a width greater than your height prevents the need of helium
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:54:10 it's just a tip
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:54:22 the ship is fine, i really like it actually
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:55:04 perhaps so, but a lot of ships of that age curved at the bottom
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:55:09 like a big pontoon
creations-chat 2020-03-21 18:55:18 it wasn't straight up and down
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:56:45 <@!378961430738763777> this isn't a really great photo, but do you see how here the ship kind of curves out towards the waterline?
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:56:49 
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:58:02 i mean on the sides**
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:58:03 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:58:30 yes but the s i d e s
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:59:01 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:59:19 i see
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:59:35 but you could always add a third fold to the masts??
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 18:59:46 or at least the forward and center masts
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:00:21 look all im saying is it you ship would be more stable if your width is 'longer' than your height
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:00:24 here ill show you
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:00:44 
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:01:15 mine is a little more squarish but it gives you the best example
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:01:30 your ship is wide, but still has some width to it
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:01:38 ^
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:01:46 it's not obvious in the water
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:01:48 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:02:17 ocean liners like these (ones that could carry cargo, etc) were often called kettle bottoms (?)
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:02:30 because it's flat on the bottom, but short and wide
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:02:33 like a kettle
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:02:56 this same principle applys to other ships, with a little variation
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:03:07 like being more curved, or whatever
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:03:44 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:03:50 well either way,
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:03:58 just something to keep in mind next time 🙂
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:04:22 plus it saves you time but not having to experiment with how much ballast and/or helium to use
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 19:04:35 and you can use that space for creative freedom
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 20:15:55 ohhh okay

help 2020-03-30 05:41:10 Hi there, I'm looking for someone who has an advanced understanding of mech construction and/or advanced motor construction to help me out here.

I'm fairly new to mechs and anything to do with it, so help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm in the midst of constructing *EVA Unit 01* from **Neon Genesis Evangelion**, and although it doesn't look very good I'm determined to finish this and not give up for once. 😅 

Anyways, enough talk, let's get down to business.
---

I'm struggling to create an ankle joint for this foot, but because I'm unfamiliar with the processes of building something like this I don't really know what I'm doing, if I did then I wouldn't be putting this out here.

Among that, some tips to perhaps get underway for the rest of the joints, etc.

Help would be greatly appreciated, and at anytime too. I'm in no rush to complete this.
---

Please DM me for any response since I don't always remember to check this channel, thank you.

general 2020-06-15 05:50:42 yes i know but im unmotivated to open it
general 2020-06-15 05:51:19 plus csg hulls are just way easier to make and like 95% of the ro-shipping community uses them anyways so

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:23:53 just so you know, upvoting yourself doesnt go towards a rank
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:42:36 <@!626449107577471012> looks great! i haven't built a 18th century warship in quite some time, but just as some constructive criticism, perhaps try building a rounded hull? it adds a whole other depth to the build, and with your style of building would look fantastic in my opinion.

i would suggest looking at other's builds to kinda get some ideas on how that would play out. i recommend taking a look at vipEmpire's HMS Victory (search here or look for it in <#627195143040139264>)

hope this helps you in future builds! 😊
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:43:48 (just so you know, you dont have to edit your current ship if you do end up using a curved hull. but it is something to check out if you ever build another ship from scratch 😄)
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:45:12 (in the end though, it is your ship. just feel it out until you find something you like. it's about your enjoyment of the build. not others)

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:18:58 because im tired of hearing someone calling someone/something gay as if to say its bad
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:06 its rude and disrespectful

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:23:17 i would still know its not okay to say it like that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:00 if you used gay derogatorily AND you were gay, it wouldnt make a difference
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:15 because you're still making it sound like being gay is a bad thing
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:23 regardless of your sexuality

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:11 regardless what your beliefs are, if you are using gay in a sentence in reference to something being bad, it still sounds homophobic and IS homophobic
