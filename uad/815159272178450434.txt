plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:27:33 Oh right, is the copy script thing works only on pc?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:01 Or only works on mobile?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:44:08 Is it? I'm just concerned.
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:46:44 Because I saw that it doesnt let the script user to copy the material, maybe the settings for the motor and other stuff like piston does too?
