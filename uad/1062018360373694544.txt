help 2023-02-22 20:08:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:45:27 You could use conveyor engines but theyre glitchy
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:45:31 You can also just spam super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:45:39 Or make your boat a hydrofoil
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:46:22 Theres a glitch "engine" that allows you to turn very good with it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:46:41 Its about 2x3 i think and you can turn from super slow to extremely fast
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:47:18 I cant post the device because I don't have image permissions yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:50:36 Yes that is correct
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 20:51:07 Also the device breaks gravity in the rotation you choose it for
help 2023-02-22 21:04:50 It would probably be better if you didnt use a namnam plane, theyre hard to add details to or to make it so the plane actually looks like what you're going for
help 2023-02-22 21:05:57 Namnam planes are just so small so I'd recommend rebuilding the entire thing to make it not a 1 wide plane so you can fit the motor lock tower in without it sticking out
help 2023-02-22 21:06:19 1 wide planes are fine but namnam planes offer little customization from what is given to you in the tutorial
help 2023-02-22 21:07:58 Especially russian planes of that era because they all look so similar so you're basically required to either use a lot of motor lock or make it not namnam style
help 2023-02-22 21:10:16 It can be any scale
help 2023-02-22 21:10:55 Ive seen plenty of su27 but they're all namnam style so if you want to be unique then you should probably not do 1 wide
help 2023-02-22 21:16:16 Isn't su27 a little wide or am i thinking of another plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 21:22:42 Do you have better graphics though
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 21:24:01 Also why does it look like the winter event came back on the right side of your screen
help 2023-02-23 00:13:45 One block is 1.14 feet wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:03:54 Cutters are already viable in pvp what do you mean
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:06:13 Theyre also melee weapons so why would you need them at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:08:47 Use rockets instead theyre better
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:11:19 Yes but still better than cutters
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:12:07 Theyre already overpowered for ground battles
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:12:20 You can literally rip through people if you just blacklist
general 2023-02-23 01:15:17 Are you talking about a coaxial rotor?
general 2023-02-23 01:15:49 Why fake rotors
general 2023-02-23 01:15:55 Tandem rotors are easy to make
general 2023-02-23 01:16:42 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_rotors
general 2023-02-23 01:17:01 This page shows a configuration for tandem rotors so the torque counteracts so you dont spin
general 2023-02-23 01:17:06 Obviously only for actual rotors
general 2023-02-23 01:18:48 How is it spinning if its a fake rotor
general 2023-02-23 01:21:09 Testing what you said is making you spin and im not even moving
help 2023-02-23 11:23:17 I recall 1 block being 1.25 studs
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 21:28:41 Why is the a-10 smoking the fat pack ???
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 21:28:43 ðŸš¬
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 21:30:32 I would suggest using sparklers instead of that but you do you I guess
