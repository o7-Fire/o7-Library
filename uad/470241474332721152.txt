plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:21:07 ummm I lost data
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:21:40 like a data save slot
help 2019-09-12 22:22:19 !help
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:23:09 anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:24:02 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:24:12 wait... let me chek
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:24:57 it says 53351 used
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:25:34 here
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:26:19 I lost data on slot 13 or 12 I think either way it was named "jet"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:26:39 so is there any data recover tools that you guys have?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:26:50 or did you guys not prepare?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:27:39 i'm not what you would call "creative" so it looks bad but functions very well
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:29:58 i'm bad at looks but good with practicality and functionality my "jet" was very fast and able to turn fast along with a armament of 10 guns 4 rockets and 6 dumb droppable bombs
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:31:17 I was hoping on today to try and improve the amount of  bombs and the functionality of the way they dropped
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:31:29 but now I get to make a new design
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:34:05 well this just sucks but I get to redesign it better so ¯\_(ó﹏ò)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:34:11 ¯\_(ó﹏ò)_/¯*
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:34:17 wow that's broken
bug-reports 2019-09-12 22:35:25 random data losses... fix it or make a restore tool
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:55:37 Ping me with any ideas, add ons, tips, or anything else to help me make my new jet with this type of set up
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:55:50 ping me cuz I gtg soon
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:56:20 i was going for a fighter jet desigen
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:56:33 but bigger
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:56:33 like a f-18 or f-22
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:57:56 I think I need to make the wings farther up... right?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:58:03 gtg 3 mins
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:59:07 i'm looking at a f-22 for style on mine but I want something larger with the same agility
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 23:00:01 <@!505835349889777685>  I live at the end of tornado alley I swear they get the tornado then we get 3 hours of hard rain... bye
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:11:02 what u guys think?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:08:01 This plane has 26 bombs and are separated 3 ways... can be droped in groups of 10,8, and 18 or together
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:08:03 but looks bad
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:08:20 any ideas folks?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:08:43 it's pratical flies very well but looks garbo
general 2020-02-19 21:00:12 how do you un anchor a block?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:32:30 anyone know a wedge block to smoothly transition this?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:36:18 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:37:28 i don't think that would work functionality but it would work cosmetically
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:38:16 no like how pistons work irl... ya know a bunch of micro explosions
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:38:29 doesn't work functionally but looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 00:39:14 well for now my sub is gonna have a rough wedge tansmission
