The Tale of admalism (503468577672658969)
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:35:46 I just made a water bike.
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:02 Nah looks like 13+ to me
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:23 It's not like any other servers are enforcing the <13 rule... I think.
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:45 Like, what? Only one server I'm in does that.
general 2019-09-07 02:58:15 So my friends asked me to use phantom forces gun skins and the snipping tool
To turn a few of their OCs into guns *with eyes*
general 2019-09-07 02:58:59 ~~of course i used the m60 for one of them~~
~~and said they were just fat~~
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:50:20 None of my planes work anymore ._.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:56:42 It's like the entire game's been rescripted. The only plane that *does* work has several issues. Turning is much less responsive, and if I move my mouse even *slightly* down, it nosedives.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:59:46 Nope.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:59:49 It doesn't fold.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:00:52 ~~i don't know how to feel about that~~
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:01:24 That was basically the idea of the plane. It's almost entirely wings and rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:06 I haven't changed it since I managed to get it working, which was early-ish last year
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:29 Whatever, I could probably make another plane.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:38 ~~also my brother made a terrorist van for pvp~~
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:47 ~~it does nothing but drive around and explode~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 01:58:38 I'm the juggernaut
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 01:59:38 ~~rockets and jet engine haven't really been used~~
~~i just keep them for the weight now~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 01:59:57 Haven't seen a single build that can push this thing around without stupid amounts of engines.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:04:49 My brother's first PvP build was an exploding van.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:05:00 He actually put effort into it.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:05:12 I, however, just took a plane I already had and put guns on it.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:05:18 ~~no sometimes we play together tho~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:05:40 No I want to turn him into me.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:06:10 ~~now i will make an exploding van because that actually works pretty well~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:22:37 Kaboom?
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:22:59 Yes Rico, kaboom.
