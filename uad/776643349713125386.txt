plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:58:52 What is a legacy missile?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:59:45 mb
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 15:03:14 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 15:03:21 The numbers arent coordinates
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 15:03:30 they are the color codes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:05:20 You should buy gravity slider
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:06:05 It is cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:08:46 speaker
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:08:59 the winter event items can be obtained during winter
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:11:40 Wait till winter
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:12:04 Ngl I wish we could clone builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:12:39 Like make one thing then make another one using a tool.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:13:17 Shame I cannot suggest yet.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:25:20 Modified a tutorial build of a V-wing starfighter
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 16:25:26 Now it is pretty good
general 2022-08-23 06:42:12 hello
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 09:50:53 I love committing warcrimes in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 14:11:15 I took a tutorial jet and made it able to airdrop my car
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 14:18:36 submarines
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 14:18:41 against shredders
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 14:22:55 idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 14:59:36 those curves
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:01:58 I need to be lvl 3
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:03:19 they should add non pvp explosives
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:03:30 so you can self destruct but not for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:39:41 I suck at building tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:42:14 My best build is a modded tutorial jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:44:48 Same
bot-central 2022-08-23 15:45:22 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:56:22 How is it so fast?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 15:56:27 What engine
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:37:16 Tbh I don't know how to get VC in Roblox
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:38:08 Impossible
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:38:29 Those aren't real
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:39:31 Cars are lies made by the government
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:41:34 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:41:53 A republic Juggernaut Turbo Tank
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:42:06 Or whatever they are called
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:43:20 I doubt it will be effective
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:46:32 Plane that can airdrop a WW2 sub into the ocean
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:47:47 Maybe
bot-central 2022-08-23 16:48:01 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:48:46 Probably
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:49:32 I needs an engine at the front to push it up
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:49:42 If the sub is too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:51:25 That is a cool plane in the background
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 16:55:35 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:23:59 Someone should make a shredder launching boat
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:24:56 A ship that has 5 or so shredder bugs that can launch  out and used to defend the ship
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:25:10 It would be fun
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:25:30 Evading shredders while trying to bomb the ship
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:25:49 A whole fleet of shredder ships
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:37:51 Shredder ships
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:38:05 They need to become a reality
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:49:45 Good
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:50:02 Time to plan for the shredder boat uprising
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:52:11 Imagine
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:52:41 They would probably lose 55% of their player base
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:05:28 It is a boat that has 3 or so launchers that launch unmanned Shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:06:53 A portable squad of server killers
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:07:36 That is tucked away in what looks to be a normal aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:08:44 The shredders will be taking out bombers
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:09:13 Perhaps someone being in a gunner turret
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:09:31 So there aren't any anti ship subs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:10:12 Hence why I made an idea
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:10:32 A jet that is fast enough to fly over and airdrop a car
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:11:10 The car has turret guns so it can kill the driver
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:11:50 The car or the boat?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:12:13 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:12:42 Rn I am using a nightchaser jet from one of tankfish's old tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:13:11 Then I modded it so it could carry my combat dragster underneath
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:13:43 The jet can kamikaze once the car disconnects
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:14:14 Medium sized fighter jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:15:17 I have another mod with 2 scatter bombs attached to it
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:15:54 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:15:59 Probably not
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:16:14 https://youtu.be/O9Wbm982E2Y
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:16:27 This is the vanilla nightchaser
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:17:26 I am able to fly well using my 3x9 combat dragster
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:18:20 Although It required more engines to carry the 2 scatter bombs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:20:13 My term for motor locked bombs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:21:23 Hmm?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:22:01 Disconnectors with every explosive block
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:23:31 It was too heavy for the nightchaser so I also added propellers underneath each bomb
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:23:59 They disconnect once the bombs have been dropped
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:25:56 I suck at building so I take decent tutorial builds and mod them to be good against any pvp situation
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:28:17 For what?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:29:48 Image 2
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:29:59 Imo
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:39:47 Add side thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:41:05 The propellers that sound like drunk hobos
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:42:00 Add vertical take off
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:42:33 Block built wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:43:04 Motorlock seats
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:45:28 Upgrade the tutorial jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:45:45 With a shredder bug launcher
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:46:39 All mine are green and black
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:46:50 Unless they are supposed to be something
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:47:23 I purposely join a server with potato users
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:47:35 Then use my latest scatterbomb
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:48:30 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:48:52 A scatterbomb shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:50:20 My airdropable dragster
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:51:22 I heard Minecraft 2 will also release when that happens
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:53:27 The best anti shredder strat is to seek cover under the sky island's turbine
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:54:19 Blacklisting is for cowards
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:55:35 Use a jet that can airdrop your favorite vehicle directly on top of your enemy causing them to get flung
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:56:02 Ik
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:56:09 But it sucks
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:56:18 There was this annoying tank guy
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:57:10 So I used what I call my hyper speeder which is a hover type thing that looks kinda like a shredder which has a hyper drive
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:58:15 How it deals a lethal blow is where it launches at hyper speed with a spinning cutter at the front and it crashes through the enemy
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:58:43 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:59:26 But blacklist users are intangible
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:00:23 So you do a little bit of damage and then fly through them and into the void
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:01:22 So I added a firework launcher behind the cutter
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:01:46 So then I just need to spam click while in hyper speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:01:59 And that normally works
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:03:58 Instead of building a quality vehicle I just add on to my pre-existing builds until they are good in any situation
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:05:29 I have made a couple
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:05:49 Pvp is all that matters
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:37:54 Airdropable car
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:43:32 I am gonna work on the car
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:43:38 to make it better
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:43:44 and give it a cleaner landing
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:48:13 Classic PC moment
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:48:26 2 shredder balls and a lag machine
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:48:47 and a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 05:57:19 A smiley face
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:31:46 I think I may have it almost completed
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:31:58 it now landeds cleanly
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:32:03 has a hover feature
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:32:23 can connect to the ground so it can go under the map
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:32:28 a nitro boost
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:32:37 rocket turret with guns
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:33:06 a self destruct mode for the jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 06:55:23 also a vertical take off
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:08:50 and a T-bag function
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:21:05 
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:21:26 the base is only 1 and a half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:22:45 lvl
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:22:46 3
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 07:23:48 talking
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:16:11 which one?
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:16:27 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:16:30 interesting
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:16:49 the user of it sucked
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:17:03 they didn't seem to know how to make it spin and fly at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:17:35 not me
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:17:45 I have a load of 5 shredders
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:18:02 all using my flare of adding nearly every possible function
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:18:38 I made a bomb called the scatter screen
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:19:13 it is a normal scatter bomb except each part has a powerful smoke pipe
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:19:20 you drop it to blind your enemies
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:21:10 L
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:21:14 imagine being a whitename
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:23:18 so many new people
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 09:04:48 Dar man?
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 09:07:38 you in pvp?
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 09:17:22 
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:36:37 It is a car
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:41:46 I connected it to my best tutorial jet. It is made to be airdropped off the jet then activate parachutes which disconnect. the image is the car after being airdropped. The features are:
1. Off-road mode
2. Racing mode (Makes it stick to the ground and not fly off)
3. Turret armed with guns and missiles
4. Hover thrusters so it can go on water
5. A nitro boost
6. Detachable Parachutes
7. Racing mode can be used as a T-bag function
8. Self destruct mode
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:44:06 It's fine
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:46:32 This is what it looks like when attached to the jet btw

The jet is a modified tutorial plane
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:49:01 I got ratio'd
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 10:29:57 mf are trying to make Obi Wan Kenobi bi

plane-crazy 2022-08-24 10:54:34 I wish I was good at building
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 10:55:10 I don't know what I want to build tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:10:26 Made a working giant motor
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:11:36 first one means your nose is too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:12:00 third one is being too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:12:24 second is probably something about not having good control over the vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:15:40 no
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:15:44 that is your problem
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:16:11 The blue
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:16:17 it is good to have in near the center
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:17:13 Plane Crazy is hard :(
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:20:18 Proof you dont need wings at the front
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:20:48 I totally don't have disconnectors hiding 1x1 controllers
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 11:21:02 kinda

creations-chat 2022-08-24 14:46:15 I got Ratio'd
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 12:33:03 Make a huge block?
creations-chat 2022-10-09 04:26:50 This was my first time building something from scratch while using an image as reference
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 04:33:15 I tried
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 04:36:17 I will eventually make a version where he can turn into his helicopter mode as well
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 04:36:41 alg
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 04:36:52 I don't play plane crazy much
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:56:47 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:56:52 curst building technique?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:58:49 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:19:47 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:19:57 Perhaps I could turn it into an eye
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:23:23 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:27:05 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:27:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 09:27:27 I tried using perspective
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:27:24 I fixed the car mode
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:27:58 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:29:45 I kinda wanna make it where he can turn into his helicopter mode
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:29:51 but I suck at helicopters
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:30:05 and he partsforms to transform
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:34:20 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:35:16 ik
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:35:24 the top is my updated design
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:35:29 Better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:37:18 Like this?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:38:35 so like this?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:39:08 his design is annoying tbh
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:45:11 https://streamable.com/hnjcg2
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:45:20 a small showcase of the vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:46:19 that flip though was pretty crisp
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:49:24 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:49:27 I suck at building
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:53:11 idk how you are so good at building
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:57:50 I fixed up the back
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:58:12 what type of fish?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:10:16 Option A or B?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:10:21 second one is in accurate colors
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:17:50 I removed the hid the missiles away in the vehicle while using half blocks for the engine detail
creations-chat 2022-10-10 22:36:07 hmm
creations-chat 2022-10-10 22:38:09 1. I will try but Mechs and Helicopters aren't my strong suit
2. He partsforms so idk

I'll try regardless
creations-chat 2022-10-10 22:40:55 Unless I do the dumb weapon storage, his swords need to clip on to become the rotors
creations-chat 2022-10-10 22:43:19 which figure do you have?
creations-chat 2022-10-10 22:58:23 I started on the wing things
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:00:28 that is kinda mean
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:03:14 Hmmm
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:06:46 Idc about looks I am trying to make a triple changing vehicle
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:08:48 looks come second to function in my book
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:11:34 I don't care about the builds I just want to practice by creating your prompt
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:17:03 ok ima not make a triple changing springer, I'm too much of a noob
creations-chat 2023-05-04 14:18:52 fixed it :)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 15:57:17 I added an artillery cannon to the back of my lab truck thing
creations-chat 2023-05-05 12:13:31 I'll remake it when I get better at the game
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 10:45:58 whats the point of Metal?
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 10:46:17 does it make your build more durable in pvp?
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 10:46:27 or is it just an aesthetic
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 10:48:07 glass is self explanatory
