the-dump 2020-08-18 22:12:22 Anyone want a meme about Bethesda? Or no?
the-dump 2020-08-18 22:13:29 I’ll take that as a no......
the-dump 2020-08-18 22:13:36 Although now I am kinda worried....
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:22:39 Anyone wanna see my heavy cargo plane?
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:22:47 I’m not very good, but I think it looks nice.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:23:07 Anyone?
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:23:19 Okay. ☹️
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:26:54 I wanna try making this.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:27:00 
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:27:06 I don’t know how though.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 22:27:21 It’s the BFG 10,000 from Doom Eternal.
the-dump 2020-08-18 22:30:38 
the-dump 2020-08-18 22:30:47 This may be an old meme, but oh well.
general 2020-08-18 22:34:34 Wanna see my best attempt at a large cargo plane?
general 2020-08-18 22:35:41 Anyone?
general 2020-08-18 22:41:05 If I were to change this plane into a bomber, how many bombs do you think I could hold?
general 2020-08-18 22:41:11 
general 2020-08-18 22:41:33 
general 2020-08-18 22:41:39 True.

the-dump 2020-09-26 02:46:31 Me and da bois.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:47:50 I was playing Lumber Tycoon yesterday and a hacker took or deleted my base. I spent months working on that thing, and I had a bunch of things I loved dearly in it. I was selling some spook wood (an October-only event, currently it is super rare) when all of a sudden a friend of mine says my base disappeared. I checked my saves, and sure enough, everything was gone. I reloaded, gone. I rejoined gone.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:48:42 I hope that the hacker who did that gets karma badly. That took hours upon hours upon hours to build, and it was gone within seconds.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:50:06 I’m talking about Lumber Tycoon, not Plane Crazy.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:51:04 And it wasn’t a loss of data, I know a hacker did it. I think it was either this Saturn guy, since as soon as I was on his base (he was the one I was selling the wood to), my base disappeared.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:52:39 Then this IceWolf guy, while I was trying to comprehend what had just happened, pushed me into his truck and drove into the water. I almost lost my axes due to him. I had a rare one too. I survived, just barely. But all I had left was my axe, the power of ease of building, and my money.
the-dump 2020-10-20 18:53:21 I’ll stop ranting now. I’m sorry. I am just really upset that I lost all of my hard work and incredibly infuriated at the person who did it.
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:29:42 My plane somehow still flies, even though it is this damaged. My best plane by far.
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:29:52 
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:30:16 Here is a picture of the plane without damage, just for reference.
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:31:34 Nvm, couldnt find the picture
help 2020-10-27 22:50:21 I don’t know if I am right, but for impact speed, don’t they have to be going a certain speed in order for them to blow up?
help 2020-10-27 22:50:53 If they hit the ground at a speed above what is set, I think they will blow up.
help 2020-10-27 22:50:59 I’m not entirely sure though.
help 2020-10-27 22:51:01 Okay.
help 2020-10-27 22:51:43 Alright. The guy above was asking about what impact speed meant.
help 2020-10-27 22:51:51 I do sometimes, but now all the time.

general 2020-10-29 07:32:22 Dunno if I am supposed to be going this fast....
general 2020-10-29 07:37:57 It’s a bot.....
general 2020-10-29 07:38:19 You can toggle smoke pipes.
general 2020-10-30 02:50:59 Is anyone else having trouble with Plane Crazy?
general 2020-10-30 02:51:16 It just kicked me from the game and I can’t get back into it.
general 2020-10-30 02:51:27 I did.
general 2020-10-30 02:51:56 I play on mobile so all I had to do was close the game and reopen it.
general 2020-10-30 02:52:27 I’ll try it again. If I don’t come back, then it’s working again.
the-dump 2020-10-31 20:08:12 MAXIMUM SPEEDDDDDD

the-dump 2020-11-01 18:23:29 EVEN BIGGER MAXIMUM SPEDDDDDDD.
general 2020-11-03 15:49:00 How do I make a suggestion?
bot-central 2020-11-03 15:49:16 ?shelp
general 2020-11-03 15:50:46 How would a flamethrower in Plane Crazy sound to people? It could be used to make large vehicles look good whenever they intentionally break apart, or it could be used for PvP purposes.
help 2020-11-04 15:00:02 @CadKiller87 Here is one of the ways you can make that 23-wide circle. Black and yellow is blocks, red is 4x1 wedges, blue is 2x1 wedges, and white is 1x1 wedges.
help 2020-11-04 15:00:58 Ignore the white block toward the top of the triangle, that was a mistake. Forgot to color that one. :/
help 2020-11-04 15:01:15 Hope this helps!

the-dump 2020-11-05 20:32:03 Oh
the-dump 2020-11-05 20:33:19 Also I’m not sure if anyone here can do this, but this can be turned into a “___ of the ___, what is your wisdom” thing.

the-dump 2020-12-13 06:27:26 The most creations made by different people all spawned in at the same time near water I have ever seen.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:33:06 It is to me.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:33:20 That’s roughly 6 creations.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:33:30 I’m surprised my tablet didn’t implode.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:33:41 My game likes to chug when I go near water.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:34:03 3 ships, 3 planes
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:34:31 Looks like an aircraft carrier, a destroyer, and a smaller ship, possibly a scout ship.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:34:46 Then an A-10, my float plane, and a random guys plane.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:34:53 Therefore, 6 vehicles.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:35:42 Near the snowy peaks.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:35:58 There is an A-10 over the random guys plane.
the-dump 2020-12-13 06:36:08 They look like the same vehicle.

the-dump 2020-12-28 21:09:25 Sorry, I just got back. 
And about what you said: What is so wrong with it? If I want to post something, I will post it. If you don’t like it, so be it. I have seen much worse on this server. If you don’t like what I or anyone else posts, don’t be on this server.
But have a great day, and choose your battles wisely.
🙂
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:11:32 Not really an apology.
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:16:22 I am confused now. I wasn’t the first to send that meme, I found it on here. Why would I be the one to get in trouble?
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:16:28 Or, rather, warned.
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:17:10 I dunno where to find it, it was a day or two ago,
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:17:36 Okay, be back in an hour once I find it.
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:23:19 Alright, I have searched but I can’t find it.
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:23:41 I don’t wanna get anyone else in trouble.
the-dump 2020-12-28 21:23:52 All I know is that I got it from here.
the-dump 2020-12-29 02:34:09 How to I make something a spoiler if I am on mobile?
the-dump 2020-12-29 02:34:31 Oh.

the-dump 2020-12-29 04:07:16 Nowhere did it say anyone died
the-dump 2020-12-29 04:07:22 For all we know it could be faked
the-dump 2020-12-29 04:09:56 
the-dump 2020-12-29 04:12:00 Please just stop. It was 1 meme, I already got warned, let it be the end of it.

the-dump 2021-01-01 23:25:48 Am I wrong?
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:28:08 Nope, not the correct lyrics.
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:28:11 Wrong song then.
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:28:44 “I don’t wanna set the world on fire, I only wanna set a flame in your heart.”
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:28:57 “I don’t wanna set the world on fire, I only wanna tear it apart.”
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:29:04 Those are the lyrics I know.
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:35:22 You mean the song?
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:35:43 It is called “Welcome To My Apocalypse”

the-dump 2021-01-01 23:38:52 Yes.
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:39:09 Oh.
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:41:35 I was close
the-dump 2021-01-01 23:41:48 Sorry.

the-dump 2021-01-02 17:06:42 Is anyone else experiencing issues with videos and stuff in Discord and YouTube?
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:02 For me the audio is about 2 seconds head of the video.
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:11 I’ve restarted the apps, didn’t fix it.
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:24 I restarted my IPad, that didn’t solve it either.
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:29 I dunno how to fix it.
the-dump 2021-01-02 22:14:11 I play GTA V on a Lenovo laptop and every time I try to get past this one part of a mission it crashes.
the-dump 2021-01-02 22:14:24 It’s one of the missions after meeting Trevor.
the-dump 2021-01-02 22:14:30 And ideas on how to fix it?
the-dump 2021-01-02 22:14:37 It’s on the same street.
the-dump 2021-01-02 22:14:44 Should I take another street?
the-dump 2021-01-03 04:38:36 There we go
the-dump 2021-01-03 04:38:36 
the-dump 2021-01-03 04:38:45 Now I fixed ‘em.
the-dump 2021-01-03 04:46:47 Eh, close enough.
the-dump 2021-01-03 04:47:12 Excellent.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:40:20 We getting some big flakes right now.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:40:30 They are at least half an inch across.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:41:02 You don’t have my address, so technically no.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:41:27 All you know is what the street I live on looks like from outside my window.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:42:38 It’s a beautiful place to live though, the sunset is able to be viewed perfectly from this window.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:43:12 I am able to speak, so I will speak.
the-dump 2021-01-03 18:58:46 
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:37:48 
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:54:12 Good you are.
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:55:31 You know what I would love to see added? A fire thing. Say for example you create a plane that is meant to have a wing shot off or able to be detached. It would be cool if some flames could come out of that wing.
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:55:45 It could also be used for PvP purposes, but I would like it for aesthetics.
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:56:35 Yeah I know.
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:56:38 Sadly.
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:56:55 Plane Crazy 2.0?
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:59:05 Anyone play Scrap Mechanic?
the-dump 2021-01-03 19:59:09 It’s not on Roblox.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:01:56 Anyone want $50 Robux?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:03:00 Alright, I have a challenge then.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:03:29 I will send a picture to this channel, first one to send a picture of it, build in Plane Crazy, with them next to it, gets $50 Robux.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:05:03 Here is my proof.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:05:31 And here is the challenge, choose your build.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:05:36 Dude look at the balance
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:06:19 It doesn’t have to be big, it just has to be recognizable
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:06:27 I’ll make it $100 then.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:06:46 Well then you don’t have to do it.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:07:08 It’s just a friendly challenge, no one has to do it.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:07:37 Just make it look recognizable, it doesn’t have to be good.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:08:03 100 bobux
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:08:19 Again, no one has to do it.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:09:03 Which one is it?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:09:34 I’ll wait a little bit long, just to see if someone else makes something.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:09:44 Then I’ll give the bobux.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:10:02 Is Legend123999 your Roblox name?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:11:01 alright. I’ll wait a bit, see if anyone else posts, then I’ll decide.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:11:14 I will give 100 bobux today, no doubt about that.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:11:19 I don’t want the bobux anyway.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:11:34 Someone gifted them to me, and I didn’t want that. So I’ll gift them away again.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:12:52 I’ll make my decision at 4pm New York time.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:12:59 It’s 3:12 right now
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:16:20 Do you have to friend someone to gift them Robux?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:16:34 I thought you could just gift it to them, but I can’t see how.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:17:19 I was gonna give harsnavary42 some Robux since he only needed 2, but I don’t know where to look to be able to give them the Robux.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:17:52 Oh....
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:18:06 I had no idea of that, I thought I could just give them
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:18:10 Why so much needed?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:18:26 Well nvm then, sorry if I wasted all of your time. ☹️
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:18:48 yeah, why is Roblox over protective?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:19:12 The tagged words are “my red”
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:19:13 Why though?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:20:36 That makes sense, if it wasn’t filled with stupid kids the abomination called “Adopt Me” would only have a few people on it.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:21:17 But yeah, I’m sorry again.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:21:32 I would’ve given the Robux, I was ready to, but I had no idea all that was needed.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:22:55 I’m sorry, 😔
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:23:50 It’s not false advertising, I was 1000% ready to give those Robux, I just didn’t know so much was needed just to give them.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:24:07 Can I give the Robux through the Plane Crazy group?
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:24:24 Okay then.
the-dump 2021-01-03 20:24:41 Well, thanks anyway for at least taking part in it.

the-dump 2021-01-04 08:57:39 Since we are on the topic of birds, here is my bird Alex who died a few months back.
the-dump 2021-01-04 08:57:57 I miss him so much.
the-dump 2021-01-04 08:58:34 They live to be about 60, but he died around the age of 12.
the-dump 2021-01-04 08:58:48 He broke his hip and we didn’t realize until it was too late.
the-dump 2021-01-04 08:59:01 We took him to the vet a few days before he died and they told us that.

the-dump 2021-01-05 16:12:22 See ya then.
the-dump 2021-01-05 16:12:34 You aren’t gonna last much longer on that charge.
the-dump 2021-01-05 16:13:00 But I’ve actually gotta go, schoolwork is requesting a lot of me right now.
the-dump 2021-01-05 17:16:49 Question for anyone who has played a game like Fallout and a game like Minecraft: Is it better to have infinite inventory with limited weight (Fallout) or have limited inventory with infinite weight (Minecraft)?
the-dump 2021-01-05 17:17:04 That’s what I think too.
the-dump 2021-01-05 17:17:31 You can carry everything you want in Fallout, but you get weighed down so you can’t run or fast travel.
the-dump 2021-01-05 17:18:09 In Minecraft you have limited inventory, but you can carry literal tons of materials.
the-dump 2021-01-05 17:18:29 Unless you have dupe glitches, I know a good one for Fallout.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:23:35 A mountable Mini Nuke launcher.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:26:33 Anyone play Scrap Mechanic? Just wondering.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:26:52 It’s like Plane Crazy and Minecraft mixed together.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:27:04 It’s not like a ripoff game either, it is pretty good quality.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:27:21 You can build bases like in Minecraft, but you can also make vehicles.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:30:56 It’s better than Plane Crazy because you can actually control what gets connected to what. If you place a piston on a pillar, and put a block on the piston, it will connect with the piston and the pillar, and it won’t move. In Scrap Mechanic you can have the blocks get connected to either a piston or a pillar.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:31:01 Sorry, I’ll shut up now.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:31:52 No...
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:31:55 I don’t think I was.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:32:13 I joined this a few months back.
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:32:20 Maybe 6 months?
the-dump 2021-01-06 05:32:24 I dunno.

the-dump 2021-01-10 21:55:44 Fun Fact: You can’t drive a Lamborghini over 100 mph.
the-dump 2021-01-10 21:56:02 Reason: You don’t have enough money to buy one.
the-dump 2021-01-10 21:58:58 Then you are able to drive a Lamborghini over 100 mph.

the-dump 2021-01-18 20:10:33 That photo is pfp worthy.
the-dump 2021-01-18 20:10:46 Not for me, but someone could use it.
the-dump 2021-01-19 00:28:59 
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:04:20 Personally, I don’t approve of furries, I wouldn’t want to be one, but if someone else is one, I won’t judge them.
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:07:46 Everyone who uses it, anyway.
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:09:03 Correct.
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:18:00 Smacks it like in the game Satisfactory, where the more and faster you press the craft button the more it starts to heat up and glow.
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:31:17 I don’t know if anyone plays this game, but here I go.
the-dump 2021-01-19 16:31:50 If you could mix three Rainbow Six Siege characters to form a super soldier, who would you mix?
general 2021-01-21 17:10:13 Is anyone on here EXTREMELY good at motor lock and making vehicles look incredible?
general 2021-01-21 17:10:35 I have a build idea, but I’m not that good and I don’t really know how to kotorlock that well.
general 2021-01-21 17:10:39 Motorlock*
general 2021-01-21 17:10:49 
general 2021-01-21 17:11:18 This could be HOF worthy, if you make it huge and drops drones.
general 2021-01-21 17:11:52 I’m not trying to reach HOF, I’m just giving others ideas for how they could.
general 2021-01-21 17:13:06 So I have a question about motor lock, is it possible to have a motor rotate blocks inside of a motorlock thing?
general 2021-01-21 17:13:17 Or will the blocks fight eachother and it won’t work?
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:25:30 Fun Fact: Speed Racer was originally a Manga.
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:26:01 I just searched up the functions of the Mach 5 on Wikipedia and it said that it was originally a Manga.
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:26:25 Im trying to make the Mach 5 in Scrap Mechanic, so thats why I needed to know its functions.
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:45:30 Sometimes I really hate Discord.
Does anyone else have times when the video and audio are slightly off?
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:45:40 Like the video starts a second or two after the audio.
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:46:26 I just closed and reopened Discord twice, and I restarted my IPad.
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:46:30 Still didn’t fix it.
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:46:46 It stays like this for a day or two, then goes back to normal.
the-dump 2021-01-22 21:46:54 For about a month or two, then does it again.
the-dump 2021-01-23 17:34:41 Fun fact: it takes 8-9 minutes for light from the sun to reach Earth. So, if the sun went out, we wouldn’t know until 8-9 minutes later.
the-dump 2021-01-26 16:24:43 Dang.
the-dump 2021-01-26 16:24:55 Nvm then.

the-dump 2021-01-28 02:47:58 I choose Glockatoo.
the-dump 2021-01-28 02:52:54 I had a cockatoo named Alex, but he died back in November.
the-dump 2021-01-28 02:53:33 He was the only animal that has bonded with me, and I didnt even get to have him for more than 2 years.

the-dump 2021-02-10 20:05:24 I need something to make, gimme a weird looking plane and I’ll try to make it eventually.
the-dump 2021-02-10 20:06:37 No. Anyone else?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 20:19:40 I finished making a bomber/fighter (inspired by the Thunderhead Bomber from Just Cause 4) a few days ago and could take some ideas for the front half of the plane. The paint job isn’t finished yet, I plan on finishing the build first, then painting it. I will probably end up remaking the plane, there are a few things wrong with it, but I will still take suggestions.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 20:22:31 Here is what the bomber looks like in JC4. I play completely on mobile, but I try my best with stuff.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 04:02:27 They are called the Black Hand. Are you thinking DRE? Rico is considered a Dictator Removal Expert, so maybe thats where you got the "DR" from. And yeah, I do think I will remake the plane. I did originally have it so that the wings could be pushed backward further, but for some reason a motor on motor makes the wing shake, so I had to give up on that and just go for what it can do now. The wings move back slightly for more control and a better look, but not nearly enough.
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:18:00 I did watch a video about Titanfall 3 and one of the developers or someone said that they haven’t completely dropped Titanfall. They are not currently working on a Titanfall 3, but they said that doesn’t mean they never will.
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:18:07 Sorry if I’m late to the party.
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:19:37 I’m really hoping they continue Titanfall, the ending had such a huge cliffhanger.
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:19:54 Anyone else know what I am talking about?
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:20:43 At the very end of the credits, you can see a pilot helmet on a desk. The helmet flashes a few times, and when translated, it says something along the lines of “Jack?”
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:21:39 BT-7274 was the only titan to ever have been connected to that helmet, so it has to be BT trying to communicate. However, if you played till the end of the game, it appears that BT goes down with the planet.
the-dump 2021-02-11 14:21:45 But ill stop now.

the-dump 2021-02-22 12:48:33 
the-dump 2021-02-22 12:48:46 Nah nvm, might get in trouble somehow for that one.

the-dump 2021-04-14 14:02:08 Oh my gosh, an ambulance just went down my street and it’s siren was broken, I swear it sounded like a higher-pitched version of Siren Head.
the-dump 2021-04-14 14:02:24 That was weird.
the-dump 2021-04-14 14:03:10 Well, not my street, there is a train yard that separates my street and the rest of the town, it was on a street across the yard.
the-dump 2021-04-14 14:03:33 But still pretty close, I’ve never heard that before on an ambulance.

the-dump 2021-07-02 15:32:22 I’m here for the memes, and that’s it.
the-dump 2021-07-02 15:32:46 Well, updates on the game are nice too, but those are far and few in between.
the-dump 2021-07-03 18:32:22 Here was a concept for a sports car, it’s only 33 inches tall.
the-dump 2021-07-03 18:35:39

the-dump 2021-07-05 01:04:44 I am safe. Are you blind?
the-dump 2021-07-05 02:09:33 Gone.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:48:26 The person who created this noise needs to die.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:48:40 That will literally make people go deaf.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:54:45 I’m sorry for you.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:54:52 That sound is terrible.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:56:34 That video makes me scared to click on any video since I first heard it.
the-dump 2021-07-05 03:57:02 I even turned down my volume all the way, took off my headphones and put them on my desk, and the sound still hurt my ears.

the-dump 2021-07-06 03:23:17 Two different servers are posting FNAF related stuff.

the-dump 2021-07-08 14:21:41 
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:14:27 I play on mobile too.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:14:41 I could play on my computer, but I choose not to.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:20:08 If you want to and have the money, there is a game called Scrap Mechanic on Steam.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:20:21 It’s like Plane Crazy but on steroids.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:20:26 Oh okay.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:21:18 I love the game, but the biggest problem with it is the lag.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:21:29 Scrap Mechanic.
the-dump 2021-07-09 16:21:37 I don’t have Stormworks.

the-dump 2021-07-12 16:18:52 I always thought it was centered.
the-dump 2021-07-12 16:25:36 I want to take a pet bird of mine to the rally.

the-dump 2021-07-20 06:40:09 Where did the common sense of people go?
the-dump 2021-07-20 16:25:58 Here, have a Heavy Metal version.

the-dump 2021-07-24 04:44:12 
the-dump 2021-07-24 04:46:54 I dunno
the-dump 2021-07-24 04:46:56 Maybe
the-dump 2021-07-24 04:50:58 *It’s time for a siege*
the-dump 2021-07-24 15:38:56 
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:35:40 Is this a legit question?
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:37:45 I made this a few weeks ago, use it if you want.
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:37:55 
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:38:04 
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:39:16 Always start with an outline. Make a rectangle. Then add more shapes on that rectangle.
the-dump 2021-07-24 21:39:43 Never make a building that is just a box, unless you are going for something like a skyscraper

the-dump 2021-09-11 20:52:31 Opinion on the Sopwith Camel?
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:52:51 It’s my favorite plane.
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:53:29 The Bristol is also pretty good.
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:53:40 The Gotha V is my favorite bomber.
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:54:12 This one
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:55:38 Actually here is the Gotha V, the other photo is an earlier Gotha
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:17:37 
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:12:22 Pennsylvania is spelled wrong
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:15:57 Also what is the blank state
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:16:09 Geography is one of the few classes I suck at
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:17:23 Close enough
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:19:11 The only ones I can remember off the top of my head is the four corners, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York.
the-dump 2021-09-16 00:19:49 And when I say corners I mean Washington, California, Florida and Maine.
the-dump 2021-09-24 17:20:47 A good choice
the-dump 2021-09-24 17:20:54 Black olives are good
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:32:12 That mission was kinda tough
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:34:46 
the-dump 2021-10-03 01:54:29 Nuts
the-dump 2021-10-15 20:33:51 It’s JC4

the-dump 2021-10-29 21:09:05 
the-dump 2021-10-29 21:09:17 Go
the-dump 2021-10-30 01:11:17 This is something I did not expect to see on this server
the-dump 2021-10-30 01:11:23 Typically it is the opposite
the-dump 2021-10-30 01:12:43 
the-dump 2021-10-30 17:41:06 
the-dump 2021-10-30 18:46:22 
the-dump 2021-10-30 23:42:47 
the-dump 2021-10-31 23:32:21 
the-dump 2021-11-01 01:45:18 about right
the-dump 2021-11-06 00:12:44 Bri’ish
the-dump 2021-11-06 00:12:54 
the-dump 2021-11-06 16:17:40 Looks good. Can’t say the same for the tomato and pepper though
the-dump 2021-11-06 16:18:31 I just don’t like tomatoes plain. Ketchup and tomato soup, yes. Anything else, no.
the-dump 2021-11-06 16:18:54 But other than that it looks great

the-dump 2021-11-28 15:38:13 Scrap Mechanic
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:38:21 Is better than Plane Crazy
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:38:38 However, it isn’t multiplayer by default
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:38:48 Other than that SM is a much, much better game
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:39:09 Much easier to use compared to PC
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:45:49 Yes
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:46:08 But you can make things fly without wings mods
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:46:16 I personally prefer using the wings mods
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:46:35 But it is possible to make things fly without mods
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:46:57 There is also the fact that you can place a block on a piston and next to other blocks
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:47:02 And those blocks won’t stick
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:47:28 I don’t really know how else to describe what I am saying if you don’t understand
the-dump 2021-11-28 15:47:39 But yeah
the-dump 2021-11-28 17:02:23 Someone give me a bomber to make
the-dump 2021-11-28 17:04:44 Alrighty
the-dump 2021-11-28 17:04:55 I’ll make it in Scrap Mechanic
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:24:24 This is my character
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:25:04 That is just the default
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:25:10 Well, the old default
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:25:17 Before they added survival mods
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:25:19 mode*
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:26:17 Yeah
the-dump 2021-11-28 18:26:28 The character is kinda weirdly proportioned
the-dump 2021-11-29 07:07:13 
the-dump 2021-12-08 00:44:27 You’re forgetting one
the-dump 2021-12-08 00:44:40 The glorious redstone book
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:11:30 I’ve never understood this wing shape. I would think that there would be a ton of drag where the wing bends
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:11:37 Am I wrong?
the-dump 2021-12-19 01:40:40 Junk Jet
the-dump 2021-12-19 01:40:52 A fun and exceptionally rare weapon
the-dump 2021-12-19 01:40:57 Only 2 can be found
the-dump 2021-12-19 01:41:19 Uses anything you put into its inventory as ammo
the-dump 2021-12-19 01:41:28 Literally anything
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:35:50 Alex
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:35:50 Here is the bird I used to have
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:36:12 Sadly he passed away in November of 2020
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:38:03 He was an Umbrella Cockatoo
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:38:08 My favorite bird
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:38:21 We still have two Senegal’s though, but they are my sisters
the-dump 2021-12-20 01:38:53 This is one of them

the-dump 2022-01-01 00:00:10 Thanks for the reminder
the-dump 2022-01-01 00:00:24 I’m currently playing BeamNG and I forgot to download some mods
the-dump 2022-01-01 00:02:19 No but I can
the-dump 2022-01-01 00:02:23 I want to try out multiplayer
the-dump 2022-01-01 00:02:36 I have a pretty beefy computer so I should be fine
the-dump 2022-01-01 00:10:28 Who said they’re female
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:25:41 That’s always confused me
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:25:50 What is something like that worthy of punishment?
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:28:12 If you are actively supporting them then yes, you should get punished. But if you simply make a creation based off a historical object or vehicle then it shouldn’t be punishable. It’s history, and I hope the majority of people have learned from it and know better than to support that cause.
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:29:27 Yes, I do. And some kids like the vehicles of WWII.
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:30:31 I understand that the symbol has been given a negative connotation, but the actual meaning of the symbol isn’t bad.
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:30:46 It’s just unfortunate that such a horrible group adopted it as their symbol.
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:33:42 I can understand why it’s not allowed and I respect that, but I just believe that it shouldn’t be that way. As long as you aren’t actively supporting that group and showing it, I believe you should be fine.
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:34:43 I know the two versions
the-dump 2022-01-02 03:35:28 But yeah, that’s all I wanted to say.

the-dump 2022-02-18 16:17:42 Wrong bird, but close enough

the-dump 2022-03-06 20:15:47 Unfortunately, you’ve all been lied to. One could say *trolled*.
the-dump 2022-03-30 21:44:48 Nice plane
the-dump 2022-03-30 21:44:58 I have no idea what plane it is, but it’s nice regardless
the-dump 2022-04-10 15:47:01 That’d be too dangerous, it might kill him
the-dump 2022-04-15 16:28:42 Pull a Rico Rodriguez
the-dump 2022-04-15 16:28:58 Everyone benefits
the-dump 2022-04-23 23:58:01 
the-dump 2022-04-23 23:58:03 Have the full song
the-dump 2022-04-23 23:58:20 Or the majority of it, anyway
the-dump 2022-05-24 10:06:21 
the-dump 2022-06-10 16:57:47 I need to know what happened here

the-dump 2022-10-10 00:57:34 Hello THE, how are you doing today?
the-dump 2022-10-10 01:18:19 Very good to hear
the-dump 2022-10-16 18:54:12 Looks delicious
the-dump 2022-10-16 18:54:32 We have the same bowl, though we haven’t made that type of Mac n cheese in a long time
the-dump 2022-10-16 18:54:37 Could honestly go for some again
the-dump 2022-10-19 23:54:00 I don’t see any difference between that and the real AN 225
the-dump 2022-10-19 23:54:11 Sad joke
the-dump 2022-10-19 23:56:39 Rest In Peace AN 225 😔
the-dump 2022-10-29 14:34:42 When I first read this title I thought it was the drone that was carrying the Patriot missile lol
the-dump 2022-11-07 00:03:52 I could never live in a desert
the-dump 2022-11-07 00:04:02 I think I’d literally dry up and disappear
the-dump 2022-11-07 00:04:09 I’m a cold weather person
the-dump 2022-11-07 00:04:28 65F is too hot for me

the-dump 2022-11-14 20:49:52 My favorite flight company
the-dump 2022-11-15 03:49:37 
the-dump 2022-11-28 05:55:26 A bit hazy without the rain, but with the rain I’d say it makes it look more realistic, the haze
the-dump 2022-11-28 05:56:10 The first one looks like there’s a ton of dust, it’s a bit off, but the second with the rain makes it look like light is being messed with by the rain, more realistic
the-dump 2022-11-28 05:56:11 So the second
the-dump 2022-12-15 22:31:28 
the-dump 2022-12-15 22:34:35 How hard can you shove or pull yourself along?
the-dump 2022-12-15 22:37:41 I got it like a week ago, you expect me to remember where I get all of my memes?
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:20:58 I’ve got another plane question for any of you who know a good bit about planes. Over the past couple of weeks some vehicles/weaponry have been appearing in a lot near where I live, my bus goes by it every time I go to my secondary school, a career and technology center. And this past Monday, a jet fuselage appeared there, but I have no idea what type of jet it is. I know the helicopter is a Huey, and I believe the artillery gun (which appeared there this weekend) is a Howitzer of some sort, but I just can’t figure out the jet. Can anyone identify what it is?
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:22:22 I have no idea what they are doing there, why they are getting put there, but I’m really curios, really wanna know
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:23:15 I thought it was an A4, but the vertical stabilizer curves
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:23:27 And I don’t think the A4s did
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:23:36 Huh
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:23:41 Alright then, I did guess right
the-dump 2023-03-05 17:23:43 Thank you
the-dump 2023-03-05 18:31:55 7738 I believe
the-dump 2023-03-26 15:47:05 This might be a bit of a long shot, but I need help finding a book I read as a child. I remember the general idea of the book and the front cover, but that's it. Here's what I remember, might not be 100% accurate though.
The front cover had a giant metal wall with a huge turret on top.
The general idea was that the entire population of Earth was moved into a giant walled-off city that took up about 1/10th of the Earths surface.
Everyone thought the outside world was destroyed, just black dust.
Some kids win the chance to do this VR thing where they compete for a money prize or something.
Through this VR they find out that the outside world isn't destroyed, that it actually healed itself and is green and beautiful.
The richest of the rich, the most elite, are the only ones that know this, and they live out there in that world.
At the end the kids find a way to blow a hole through the wall and humanity is, I presume, released back into the rest of the world.
It takes place in a futuristic setting.
the-dump 2023-07-17 01:48:24 I really wanna know the story behind that, why’d the truck take the corner so fast
