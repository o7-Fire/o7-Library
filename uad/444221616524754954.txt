creations-chat 2020-12-19 00:15:30 Anybody know how to make a compact gun magazine cus i can make a fairly decent pistol magazine that loads well but i cant make a bigger one without using all my space
creations-chat 2020-12-19 00:17:41 the way i do it is i use suspension but the more bullets there are the more suspension parts i need to reach the top so by the end its ( Suspension > Bullet count )
creations-chat 2020-12-19 00:21:43 Andre i was thinking about doing mags with magnets but they can get really glitchy i was thinking about a weak thruster pushing up a platform on a slider tho idk if its better than magnets or suspension
creations-chat 2020-12-19 00:23:57 Alright i prob wont even play tomorrow but we will see

bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:19:46 i was trying to make a big truck hover and to make it look nice i had to extend the wheels beyond the some blocks that cover it. I stacked pistons (2 full size 1 half size, max settings, lock and toggled) then i spawn the truck in, extend the pistons and they just brake for some reason. They literally just fall off my car like it got damaged in pvp
bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:20:53 i have a picture of my car before and after but i cant send them here because of perms
bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:25:38 ye
bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:25:41 idk why i locked them
bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:25:52 i guess i just forgot to turn them off
bug-reports 2021-02-07 23:26:43 what does locked pistons even do
