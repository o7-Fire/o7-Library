general 2021-10-19 11:31:09 rip
bot-central 2021-10-19 11:36:54 lvl 3 is when
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:22:52 for some reason there is more land and aerial warfare than naval warfare
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:24:17 aerial can run from shredders faster
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:25:39 aerial is more stress free
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:25:55 because you know you not building a 20000 block aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:27:03 turns out the block limit is 35x35
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:27:05 i think
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:28:44 just make sure its not accurately sized
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:29:05 u
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:29:47 unless ur building the maus or anything else above 1000 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:30:01 it will be more difficult to stuff in that many motors
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:31:17 well
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:31:35 if you want to have a extremely detailed tank
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:31:45 turns out you gotta put in alot of motors
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:31:48 ye
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 09:32:17 oof
the-dump 2022-06-23 09:29:19 probably

plane-crazy 2022-08-06 12:04:26 hol up did they make a helium update?
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 12:05:08 apparently my zeppelin fly's too high
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 04:19:54 did the helium get an update?
