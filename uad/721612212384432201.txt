plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:03:53 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:05:52 i made a funny
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:05:54 give me a second
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:08:59 weaponized anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:10:17 https://streamable.com/15ydpx
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:10:24 bad quality but
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:11:22 im currently filling a entire giant box with that
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:11:34 then probably gonna do stuff after it
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:12:12 its most likely gonna work the same as that one but you going to be trapped inside a box and then its dropped on you so its more condensed
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:14:14 this is going to take a while
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:14:44 a railgun is magnets actually
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:16:12 ^^^
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:16:30 i tried making one once but it moved so fast it phased through stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:21:51 this is taking a while
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:22:00 and after that i have to go back and put anchor blocks on all of them
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:22:17 because science
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:23:04 ive done it on a much smaller scale with this
https://streamable.com/15ydpx
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:30:28 this parts done
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:30:31 now for the anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:30:51 basically a giant version of this https://streamable.com/15ydpx
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:31:40 its just gonna drop a insane amount of anchor blocks on them
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:31:59 i used like 500 disconnectors so about 500 anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:32:29 nah
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:33:01 also if their slow moving i can land on them cause its a box also
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:33:08 and this thing is the size of my entire plot so
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:34:12 well off to add anchor blocks i gues
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:37:27 also quick note there are anchor blocks in the top corners so if the box lands on you you cant move it with force
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:40:19 aaaa
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:41:00 by the end its going to have like 500 anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:50:34 ok this parts done at least
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:50:39 now i need to find a way to get this thing off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:51:24 this is upclose
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:04:27 
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:04:38 its not even done yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:06:05 i found a issue with my building
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:06:23 it takes like 2 minutes before its operational because of how many blocks are in it
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:07:08 i know
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:07:22 but like for some reason the detatchers and anchors can be used after like  a minute
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 06:46:35 what if i just put make a car with a ramp and a platform and motors that just launch the platform backwards to launch people off the map?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:37:04 there is a weird thing i want to figure out with this vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:37:14 sometimes if i turn near someone
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:37:18 it launches them at mach 5
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:49:43 you think there is a way to get a anchor block into another persons vehicle?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:50:08 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:54:59 this is what im trying right now
https://streamable.com/tyykxm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:55:22 it will stop them from moving
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:55:42 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:56:14 its mostly to test in the pvp mode thoug
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 07:56:21 since i cant find a way in otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 08:02:52 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 08:15:55 hmm
