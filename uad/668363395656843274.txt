plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:19:58 Was thinking that too
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:20:52 Probably is a stallion, there have been more US military stuff happening here where I live
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:21:23 I saw a C-130 once fly by, one of the coolest things ive seen
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:23:24 It is pretty hard to tell since it was pretty far
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:26:32 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 08:29:00 Another position, most definitely a stallion
