your bootleg scimitar sucks
stuff: Names: Mine: ESF-1 (Experimental Space Fighter). His: BWF-1 (most likely Bad War Fighter).
Mine: 5 engines (4 main, 1 SSTO engine). His: 3 engines. They're super rockets, when rockets look better (because afterburner).
Mine: Red and grey colors (kinda sexy not gonna lie) His: Black and blue (why?????)
Man's a god dang purple name, but feels the need to rip off my really sick space fighter.

The air intakes are bad, the cockpit is too inaccurate, and the build is overlocked.

the-dump 2023-01-23 18:37:29 Here is a pointless nitpick on the thumbnail of a video that is obviously targeted at small children:
That camo is no good in a city. It‚Äôs bright freakin‚Äô green! 
The parachutes are wrong. The U.S. uses T-11 parachutes, which are not circular. 
At the far left, there is a sniper. What is he doing there? He‚Äôs wearing the same gear, when he should have a ghillie suit. 
Main Man Minecraft McGee isn‚Äôt wearing his helmet. 
The path of the CH-47 that Main Man Minecraft McGee and his buddies are on seems to be going to some LZ. However, Main Man Minecraft McGee is jumping out of the helicopter. Also to note is that the helicopter isn‚Äôt too far from the ground. 
Other things to note: The helmets of MMMM‚Äôs buddies have spots that are made to look like eyes(the blue spots) and nostrils(the black spot). No country in their right mind would send their soldiers in a uniform that makes them look like cute dinosaurs, especially when that camo is bright green, and the soldiers are fighting in a city. 
MMMM‚Äôs shoes look like sneakers, not boots. You can also clearly see socks. 
The buddies of MMMM are making a bad choice by standing where they are. Someone could shoot at them. They could die. 
I have so much to say about this image.

the-dump 2023-04-12 18:00:01 One of their accessories is a UGC Limited.
the-dump 2023-04-12 18:00:41 Also, most of the layerd clothes are layered in such a way that most of the layering is in the you-know-what-area.

the-dump 2023-04-24 17:50:59 roblox desperately needs better servers
the-dump 2023-04-24 17:53:31 It's also not the weekend, so there is generally less activity on Roblox, and the server engineers are there.
