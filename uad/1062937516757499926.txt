general 2023-07-14 17:50:27 Put water and potassium on one side of the pipe with a barrier between, make shure you only use a little water though. Keep the gunpowder separated with cardboard covered in sulfer
general 2023-07-14 17:50:47 The barrier should move with gravity
general 2023-07-14 17:50:59 Fire stuff?
general 2023-07-14 17:53:36 Oh

general 2023-07-14 17:56:54 Why? It makes sense to me

Water+potassium=fire+red phosphorus=more fire+gunpowder=more boom
