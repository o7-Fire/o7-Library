plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:21 I've discovered something amazing in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:33 It's called the Lag Barrier
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:42 It's the thing that makes Players and Objects move at the same pace
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:51 When you break the Lag Barrier
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:57 Objects will move slower than players
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:28:59 For example
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:29:20 I could be driving a vehicle at a very slow speed, but when I jump out of my seat, I fly extremely far at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:29:42 Basically I made a huge ballpit and the balls move in slow motion
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:29:56 I'm an idiot aren't I
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:30:59 btw i really wanna make an airship with giant propellers facing upwards
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 19:31:00 any tips?
general 2020-09-05 19:41:12 where do i go to post videos

general 2020-09-05 19:43:29 I don't mean youtube videos, just regular videos
general 2020-09-05 19:49:58 yeah if you click on a block with the screwdriver and then press alt f4 it glitches it out and gives it a speed boost
general 2020-09-05 19:50:06 sometimes it doesn't work and the game crashes tho
general 2020-09-05 19:50:10 you gotta have a really good PC to do it
general 2020-09-05 19:51:13 what game is that
general 2020-09-05 19:53:23 WHAT GAME IS THATTTT

general 2020-09-05 20:20:51 Jesus christ Savoic, QSERF is the laggiest game ive ever played
general 2020-09-05 20:21:10 It runs at 20fps for 10 seconds and then it fully freezes on me
general 2020-09-05 20:21:21 What the actual hell
general 2020-09-05 20:21:25 My laptop isn't even that bad
general 2020-09-05 20:21:54 how do I change that
general 2020-09-05 20:22:10 I have the bottom picture all the way down
general 2020-09-05 20:22:19 How do I get to the top picture
general 2020-09-05 20:22:27 is there like a button
general 2020-09-05 20:22:28 k
general 2020-09-05 20:32:14 Savoic the in-game graphics are on low and the roblox graphics are as low as possible
general 2020-09-05 20:32:19 it still freezes after 10 seconds
general 2020-09-05 20:32:36 It runs like EVERY OTHER ROBLOX GAME completely smooth
general 2020-09-05 20:32:49 Like literally every other one
general 2020-09-05 20:33:05 I could run most of them at max roblox graphics
general 2020-09-05 20:33:08 And it would be smooth
general 2020-09-05 20:33:18 But this ONE game I can't run at the lowest of low?
general 2020-09-05 20:33:39 optimized?
general 2020-09-05 20:35:13 ok

the-dump 2020-09-06 11:06:30 if 9 helium blocks can do that, i wonder what the max amount of helium blocks could do
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:58:36 Howdy
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:58:51 So, how would you make a perfectly curved line out of plane crazy blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:03 Like, you guys know the Toppat Airship from Henry Stickmin
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:10 Yeah, the front of that
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:14 It's like a curved glass thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:22 How would you make a perfectly curved line just like that
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:29 Without it looking blocky
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 16:59:32 Like, a smooth curved line
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:00:38 So what kind of wedges would you use
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:00:49 I know Round Curved Out is one of them
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:00:55 But what else what you use
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:01:17 okay..
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:01:22 wow that's huge
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:03:39 So like, I want this, but instead of a flat wall, I want it to be curvy like the top and bottom parts. How do I do it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:04:00 yeah but what kind of wedges?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:04:09 half wedge? normal wedge? badaboom badabingo
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:04:22 can you give me some more names of wedges i could use
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:04:37 ...that's it?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:05:03 Right
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:05:14 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:25:57 Alright, I think this is as smooth as possible. Do you guys think I could make it any more smooth?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:26:23 A curved thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:26:31 Anyway do you think I could curve it more?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:26:51 Alright how
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:27:02 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:27:11 so, at THIS size, it cant be more smooth?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:27:38 Not really or no
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 17:27:42 I need yes/no answer
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 12:37:22 man i see all of these amazing builds and it makes me feel like crap because i cant build anything good
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 12:37:26 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 23:58:08 the fact that Northern Ireland is a different country to ireland makes no sense to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 23:58:16 its like north and south korea
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 23:58:30 why isn't it just 'Korea'
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 23:58:33 why isn't it just 'Ireland'
