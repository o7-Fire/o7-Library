Yet what ever kind of food you think of the heads when you eat it will taste like that food, and the heads are nonfunctional only being there as food and will come back after 10 minutes. The heads are also very hard on the shoulder yet  come off with ease and when bitten in to is soft like butter. Would that solve world hunger then?
