plane-crazy 2020-08-25 07:07:58 omg, it's beautiful
general 2020-08-26 04:07:38 <@456226577798135808> nice to see that your pfp is Cassini on its decent to Saturn's surface.
general 2020-08-26 04:08:29 ik
general 2020-08-26 04:08:45 it's sad
general 2020-08-26 04:09:18 after doing many loops
general 2020-08-26 04:09:26 and summersaults
general 2020-08-26 04:10:14 and ditching its mate on Thanos' home planet
general 2020-08-26 04:14:11 ***TRIGGERED***
general 2020-08-26 04:14:27 well yes, but actually no
general 2020-08-26 04:14:45 it has a solid core
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:14:07 how did you do that?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:15:19 what do you mean by "locked motors"?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:15:51 and what does that do?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:16:23 NANI!!!
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:16:34 I've never seen those before
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:17:18 thx
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:19:49 so at 1:50 in the first picture, is that the photomode?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 08:59:49 it looks like a blimp
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 09:00:03 mainly the Hindenburg
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:36:38 <@456226577798135808> that dragster you made is a reference to "The Blue Flame" land speed record maker.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:36:55 look it up
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:38:08 -_-
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:38:17 I did
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:38:32 your one looks weirder
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:40:14 kinda
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:40:51 nothing...
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:41:23 but it would be cool if you could make your dragster look like it tho
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:41:52 then use locked motors
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:42:59 fair enough
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:45:56 it's a bit...
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:45:58 ...bulky
creations-chat 2020-08-28 22:46:15 maybe a thinner barrel
creations-chat 2020-08-29 01:27:11 <:FalconStance1:715614632655454269><:FalconStance2:715614633737584691><:FalconStance3:715614633972727878>
creations-chat 2020-08-29 01:27:56 maybe do the Bismarck
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 07:04:14 Someone made a huge Ironman looking thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 07:04:28 It was that big it crashed Roblox
bot-central 2021-04-20 06:47:35 ?av
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:27:50 In the next 5 hours, I’ll attempt to make a working hadron collider.
general 2021-05-27 03:02:50 We need lasers in Plane Crazy
general 2021-05-27 03:03:32 Yeah, but that’s not exactly a cutting laser
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 10:39:38 Does anyone know what the pilot seat does? (not main pilot seat)
bot-central 2021-08-08 23:25:33 !rank
general 2021-08-08 23:30:01 Is it possible to make a hadron collider?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 23:55:36 yes, if the COM is near the bottom
general 2021-08-09 00:00:02 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
bot-central 2021-08-09 00:01:16 !rank

plane-crazy 2022-02-26 09:37:51 Can someone explain what the "legacy" setting does for the rockets?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:27:30 Made an almost-perfect recreation of Darkstar.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:28:06 doesn't go fast enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:28:36 I've tried multiple different thrust techniques
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:28:49 best is conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:29:13 not yet
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:29:18 but I am trying
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:29:51 I've had this blown in half in pvp and somehow got up to 22k speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:30:42 I'll keep trying different methods until I find the best one
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:39:44 I'll adjust that tomorrow
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:40:18 I'll need an image of one of these
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 10:40:43 is this motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 07:37:15 time to make my Darkstar recreation faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 07:37:25 it currently goes mid 8,000's
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 06:52:51 how fast is mach 10 in Plane Crazy's speedometer?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 07:07:02 12,250.8 km/h
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 07:11:47 15.6k is almost exactly mach 10
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 08:47:43 This is the final version of my recreation of Darkstar.
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 08:48:22 it looks like the damn thing and it flies like the damn thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 10:42:58 <@719807717782454302> I fixed it.
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 10:56:07 after my *"successful"* recreation of Darkstar, I plan on going even faster by making a recreation of the shuttle from Interstellar. Hopefully I can go faster than 40,000.
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 12:33:30 kinda
contest-chat 2023-02-11 20:58:09 We should have a Steam Locomotive next
contest-chat 2023-02-22 11:20:13 A film contest would be quite nice, basically recreate an iconic object (vehicle or not) from a movie.
contest-chat 2023-02-23 10:31:04 People can also down vote you know
