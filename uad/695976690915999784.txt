plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:59:47 u prob would for specific wing shapes idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:02:46 the delta control surface is the size of delta 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:04 piston locking exists
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:11 oh u can also put a delta 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:13 inside it
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:44 eh
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:49 i use them instead of wheels
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:06:53 normal wheels
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:07:49 the grip is good
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:07:58 also read the part where i said u can also put a 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:08:44 where lo

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:10:06 oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:10:09 well too bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:10:17 piston locking only viable option
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:11:09 no im saying it can be useful cuz of the curve
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:11:39 ok but that takes more
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:11:57 u would fr only need the control surface, one piston, and a wing panel
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:12:16 but ig
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:12:43 well yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:12:47 but u also do for angle locking
