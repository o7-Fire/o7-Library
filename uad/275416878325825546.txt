plane-crazy 2019-04-01 04:55:01 To whosever idea the icon was, good job... You have successfully confused me for like an hour. Congrats XD
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 04:56:43 To be honest though, it was a cool idea in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:17:06 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:18:39 Interesting to see how people also build non-vehicle creations. Sorta nice sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:20:31 Also, very late I know, but I just saw the new mouse follow motors and ooooooh...
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:21:27 Well, if they get worked on, then it could be very interesting
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:22:53 Though I wonder if it would ever be possible to only use certain ones at a time
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:23:00 ( Unless this is already possible, not played yet )
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:24:42 Oh, Darkz, your profile picture just gave me an idea XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:24:59 Building a dancing parrot using pistons
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:29:36 Probably because before you saved it, it was void, but then when you saved it, it actually had an empty space saved onto it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:29:57 Not sure, just grasping at straws tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 15:31:14 Well, I made the parrot
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:21:16 Oh woah, cool platformer
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:23:37 Not sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:24:44 Though you could probably attach a water wheel to another using a suspension to make gears...
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:04 Oh. ok then
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:32 Yeah, but WaTeRwHeElS
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:33 XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:27:25 Well, if you are planning on building one, best of luck
general 2019-10-16 02:38:18 Ok, so if I were to report somebody, how do I post the picture without Discord showing it like usual?
general 2019-10-16 02:38:44 Or is the channel set to not do that?
general 2019-10-16 02:51:12 Wait, how do I post evidence? The channel does not allow any file or photo posting
general 2019-10-16 02:52:37 But it does not allow me to post files there
general 2019-10-16 02:52:54 Nor can I copy paste the picture
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:40:41 I built a working claw machine. The yellow lights on the top move in a line and the joystick moves with the claw.

creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:41:06 
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:41:23 
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:42:51 I can make it weaker or stronger
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:43:10 AGH. I forgot to add the coin slots T_T
creations-chat 2019-10-17 02:19:18 I like it
creations-chat 2019-10-17 02:19:46 I hope it does not lag too bad or it may brick your computer
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:43:45 I just found a very weird bug. I have two build plates to my name, but can only use the blue one. The build is still loaded on both though...
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:43:51 
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:44:12 You
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:44:38 
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:45:42 This takes place on a PVP server. I had joined previously for a short amount of time, used the creation once, then left to try to join a new PVP server
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:45:56 Oh, ok, sorry
general 2020-01-01 05:18:14 Happy new year and new decade!
creations-chat 2020-01-17 00:37:35 [Snom] [Blockdude9985] [718 blocks]
creations-chat 2020-01-17 00:39:28 It is not the best of course, but I like it
general 2020-02-01 05:43:11 I hope I am not interrupting something, but if a mod happens to be online, I have a quick question
general 2020-02-01 05:43:50 Oh
general 2020-02-01 05:44:14 Well, I was wondering if it would be ok to build an eyeball using the little red line things to walk
general 2020-02-01 05:44:28 Like, I wanted to build a shooting eyeball
general 2020-02-01 05:44:32 But to move around
general 2020-02-01 05:44:49 The muscle things would be the legs
general 2020-02-01 05:44:55 Yeah, I guess so?
general 2020-02-01 05:45:14 Ok
general 2020-02-01 05:45:40 Ok, thank you
general 2020-02-01 05:46:16 I just figured I would ask first, since I know a eyeball would be ok, but the leggy vein things concerned me
general 2020-02-01 05:46:33 Basically an eyeball with red spider legs
general 2020-02-01 05:46:58 Because it is like, veins or muscles or something
general 2020-02-01 05:47:03 Idk
general 2020-02-01 05:47:57 Well, I just figured I would ask considering it would be an eyeball and such
general 2020-02-01 05:48:03 Just incase
general 2020-02-01 05:48:58 With the red muscle things as like spider legs
general 2020-02-01 05:49:17 That is what I wanted to ask basically
general 2020-02-01 05:49:35 Like, it would not be super detailed or anything by any means XD
general 2020-02-01 05:50:04 Well, I asked because I wanted to be sure it was ok to build JUST incase
general 2020-02-01 05:50:06 Yeah
general 2020-02-01 05:50:28 Who, me?
general 2020-02-01 05:50:42 Uh, not in any anymore
general 2020-02-01 05:51:27 Yeah, I got out of school years ago lol
general 2020-02-01 05:51:40 What?
general 2020-02-01 05:52:45 No?
general 2020-02-01 05:53:13 No
general 2020-02-01 05:54:03 Well, yeah
general 2020-02-01 05:54:15 I mean, I have been on Roblox  LOOONG TIME
general 2020-02-01 05:55:08 Uhhh...
general 2020-02-01 05:55:23 Basically I play Roblox and such
general 2020-02-01 05:56:09 Well, I mean, I do not really do much
general 2020-02-01 05:56:30 Like, I sit around and play Roblox most of the time
general 2020-02-01 05:56:42 Usually because I do not feel like doing much else
general 2020-02-01 05:57:31 But yeah, I have played Roblox for years
general 2020-02-01 05:57:51 No :/
general 2020-02-01 05:58:44 In what?
general 2020-02-01 05:59:41 Uh, no
general 2020-02-01 06:00:19 I have no idea
general 2020-02-01 06:00:49 For right now I have to work some stuff out
general 2020-02-01 06:01:07 Like health and mentality
general 2020-02-01 06:05:04 Wimsun
general 2020-02-03 21:55:27 Is anybody else getting randomly kicked?
general 2020-02-03 21:55:45 My internet is fine I think
general 2020-02-03 21:56:11 The game says "You were kicked from this game: Unspecified Reason"
general 2020-02-03 21:56:24 Error code: 267
general 2020-02-03 21:57:10 Any ideas why?
general 2020-02-03 21:57:23 Oh
general 2020-02-03 21:57:33 I have tried to join more than once with the same issue
general 2020-02-03 21:58:02 Well, I have no cheat things, nor do I even know how to use them if I had one
general 2020-02-03 21:58:44 I just was wanting to know if I have been banned somehow or something
general 2020-02-03 22:00:48 Well, I have tried like four times
general 2020-02-03 22:01:19 In fact, it is now kicking me as soon as the game opens
general 2020-02-03 22:01:32 Before it loads or anything
general 2020-02-03 22:02:16 But I am not in a PVP server?
general 2020-02-03 22:02:30 Exactly
general 2020-02-03 22:02:52 I just want to know if I have been banned for something or not
general 2020-02-03 22:03:07 As I have no idea what it could have been if so
general 2020-02-03 22:03:19 Same here I think
general 2020-02-03 22:04:36 Well, if there happens to be a mod online, could I please be notified if I have been banned or not?
general 2020-02-03 22:04:43 Only when you have the time of course
general 2020-02-03 22:06:28 Uh, if this is regarding the issue I am having, I do not have a VIP server
general 2020-02-03 22:07:14 Me?
general 2020-02-03 22:07:27 I cannot play the game at all
general 2020-02-03 22:07:37 I am
general 2020-02-03 22:07:49 I literally am just clicking the play button
general 2020-02-03 22:07:57 And it kicks me right away
general 2020-02-03 22:11:21 What is not working about it?
general 2020-02-03 22:11:27 Oh
general 2020-02-03 22:11:49 Does it use wings or the motor 2's?
general 2020-02-03 22:12:01 Oh
general 2020-02-03 22:12:19 I do not really know that much about that sadly
general 2020-02-03 22:13:00 Though I suppose you could try building a second one horizontally to see if it works that way?
general 2020-02-03 22:17:26 I really do hate to be a bother, but if there is somebody online, such as a mod, who is able to check to see if I have been banned for whatever reason, I would very greatly appreciate it
general 2020-02-03 22:18:14 Oh
general 2020-02-03 22:18:27 That is unfortunate
general 2020-02-03 22:18:39 Well, thank you for the response anyways : )
general 2020-02-03 22:19:20 So uh, should I just wait and see if the issue stops?
general 2020-02-03 22:19:37 Like, tomorrow or something
general 2020-02-03 22:19:38 Idk
general 2020-02-03 22:21:28 Well Kip, so far I have not been kicked trying that
general 2020-02-03 22:21:35 If it works, thank you so much
general 2020-02-03 22:25:42 Either that or the past tense of weave
general 2020-02-03 22:25:46 XD
general 2020-02-03 22:26:41 Now watch them show up with a woven rug with your profile pic XD
general 2020-02-03 22:27:07 Lol
general 2020-02-03 22:28:50 Acycle
general 2020-02-03 22:29:22 Ok, when I read pentacycle I pictured a bike with pentagram wheels lol
general 2020-02-03 22:29:36 Or something like that
general 2020-02-03 22:30:14 Lol
general 2020-03-11 22:25:50 How do I hide a picture as a spoiler? I have to report somebody but I have never done it before
general 2020-03-11 22:30:18 Is there a mod online or something right now?
general 2020-03-11 22:31:00 I do not want to have to ping anybody, but I am having trouble submitting a report as it is my first time
general 2020-03-11 22:34:08 Seriously, if somebody is able to help, I would very greatly appreciate it
general 2020-03-11 22:34:59 Ok, well, I tried making it look like the other reports
general 2020-03-11 22:35:09 But when I tried to press Enter, it sent the first line
general 2020-03-11 22:35:23 And now I have to wait until the timer is up to try again
general 2020-03-11 22:35:39 Ok
general 2020-03-11 22:35:53 Oh, ok, thank you so much
general 2020-03-11 22:36:05 As soon as the timer is up, I will try again
general 2020-03-11 22:40:47 AGH, I had the picture copied but I lost it
general 2020-03-11 22:42:37 Well, I have the screenshot copied
general 2020-03-11 22:43:02 But I cannot paste the screenshot
general 2020-03-11 22:43:17 I copied it instead of saved it : /
general 2020-03-11 22:43:58 How?
general 2020-03-11 22:44:50 I can paste it here, but for whatever reason, it will not let me paste it in the reports channel
general 2020-03-11 22:45:10 Let me rephrase that
general 2020-03-11 22:45:26 I have the ability to post it in this channel
general 2020-03-11 22:45:52 But when I try to post it in the reports channel, it does not let me
general 2020-03-11 22:46:46 Sorry, I have never done this before, so I want to be sure I do it properly

The link has been hidden for obvious reasons
general 2020-03-11 22:53:22 Ok there
general 2020-03-11 22:53:46 Thank you so much VoxelBox and EXPUNGED
general 2020-03-11 23:33:29 Oooh, I like the game shutdown alert
general 2020-03-11 23:33:46 I appreciate it
general 2020-03-11 23:34:29 Will it be larger?
general 2020-03-11 23:34:41 Hey, patches fix bugs, which is great
general 2020-03-11 23:37:49 Oof
general 2020-03-11 23:38:06 At least it is at the same time
general 2020-03-11 23:38:23 So you do not have one to update, then have to wait for the other
general 2020-03-12 05:36:54 Well, thank you for the tip
general 2020-03-12 19:46:25 Just curious, but has anybody else experienced the thing where you randomly get bumped around in the water?
general 2020-03-12 19:47:19 But like, it is like somebody has a sub and is ramming my build
general 2020-03-12 19:47:43 But there are no other builds near me
general 2020-03-12 19:47:48 IS it waves?
general 2020-03-12 19:48:31 The build I am using is one that floats stationary just under the water
general 2020-03-12 19:48:41 Perhaps it is a bug with rotators?
general 2020-03-12 19:48:51 It does contain them
general 2020-03-12 19:50:16 I may try to add a couple of unpowered motors to see if that makes it more stable
general 2020-03-12 19:51:29 Well, I am not pressing anything
general 2020-03-12 19:51:47 And my build keeps jerking to the left
general 2020-03-12 19:51:56 I may be able to record it
general 2020-03-12 19:52:25 Yes, two of them
general 2020-03-12 19:52:27 But that is it
general 2020-03-12 19:52:56 Yes
general 2020-03-12 19:53:04 Up and down
general 2020-03-12 19:53:18 If that makes sense
general 2020-03-12 19:53:28 Uh
general 2020-03-12 19:53:51 like a bird flapping its wings?
general 2020-03-12 19:54:29 Like, it is just to make a mouth open and close to bite something above it
general 2020-03-12 19:55:38 That is a tricky one
general 2020-03-12 19:56:09 Well, I did not mean at all to start an argument
general 2020-03-12 19:56:22 So I apologize
general 2020-03-12 19:58:31 Uh, I can send a screenshot
general 2020-03-12 19:59:13 Where do I post it?
general 2020-03-12 19:59:34 
general 2020-03-12 19:59:43 Like I said, it is just a mouth
general 2020-03-12 19:59:50 To bite something above it
general 2020-03-12 19:59:59 AKA a decoy boat I have
general 2020-03-12 20:00:30 Under the water, yes
general 2020-03-12 20:01:12 Well, that makes it go up and down
general 2020-03-12 20:01:24 The issue I have is that when I am not pressing anything
general 2020-03-12 20:01:33 The whole build jerks to the left
general 2020-03-12 20:01:41 Every like 20 seconds or so
general 2020-03-12 20:01:50 Like somebody is ramming it
general 2020-03-12 20:01:58 I am using ballast tanks
general 2020-03-12 20:02:29 I would, but I sorta need it to move up and down
general 2020-03-12 20:02:39 Motor 1s
general 2020-03-12 20:04:09 Ok, I will turn the torque
general 2020-03-12 20:04:34 And I will try making the base wider using ballast blocks
general 2020-03-12 20:04:40 Could that help?
general 2020-03-12 20:05:46 Like this?
general 2020-03-12 20:05:54 Those are ballast blocks
general 2020-03-12 20:06:20 Oooh, I wonder if wing blocks placed facing upwards would help
general 2020-03-12 20:06:41 Perhaps to create drag so it does not jerk around as much
general 2020-03-12 20:08:30 Actually, the top is regular blocks, so it floats
general 2020-03-12 20:08:36 But it IS a bit topheavy
general 2020-03-12 20:09:51 Well, I will try to make the base heavier
general 2020-03-12 20:10:29 Well, I seriously do appreciate the help
general 2020-03-12 20:10:35 Thank you all so very much
general 2020-03-12 20:10:56 Though sadly, I cannot make the base TOO heavy
general 2020-03-12 20:11:03 Or it sinks
general 2020-03-12 20:13:12 Oh
general 2020-03-12 20:13:21 I was just making it heavy
general 2020-03-12 20:14:47 Well again, thank you all so much for the help
general 2020-03-19 23:06:38 I may have found a way to go over 64 billion speed units ingame
general 2020-03-19 23:06:58 I wonder if I can build a craft using this
general 2020-03-29 23:18:20 If somebody has build a giant glitchy whip to hit people off of the map when they spawn, can I report them?
general 2020-03-29 23:19:14 Ok
general 2020-03-29 23:19:52 Wait, what do I put as the reason?
general 2020-03-29 23:20:49 Just something like "disrupting other players/trolling"
general 2020-03-29 23:20:52 LOL
general 2020-03-29 23:21:07 I french english
general 2020-03-29 23:21:25 However, I spanish german
reports 2020-03-29 23:26:58 User: joeyjojo123456
Reason: Disrupting players, trolling, knocking players off the world, possible lag machine
( They built a large glitchy whip thing that glitches everywhere and hits people even if they were still in build mode. They refused to stop when they were asked to )

general 2020-03-30 03:22:23 Am I allowed to do the thing with multiple missiles as long as I do not bother anybody too bad?
general 2020-03-30 03:22:46 I just ask because I have not seen any swarms in a while
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:25:37 Just curious, but are the trails clientside only?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:26:23 Oh, ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:07:13 Yeah, I am pretty sure the trails are only for the user who has them on their build
general 2020-04-10 02:43:44 Is there a way to see the trails on other players builds?
general 2020-04-10 02:43:48 Just curious
general 2020-04-10 02:44:11 Also, I have no idea if this goes here or in the help category
general 2020-04-10 02:44:20 So my apologies if this is in the wrong place
general 2020-05-11 23:52:08 Hm, to be totally honest, this could be either a good OR a bad thing
general 2020-05-11 23:52:11 Yes
general 2020-05-11 23:52:18 I agree
general 2020-05-11 23:52:58 Oooh, good idea
general 2020-05-11 23:53:12 Though that could be hard to do
general 2020-05-11 23:53:36 Yeah
general 2020-05-11 23:54:12 I really like that idea, though it may be much harder to do
general 2020-05-11 23:54:26 Like, *much* harder I bet
general 2020-05-11 23:55:09 Though I suppose we will just have to see how stuff goes
general 2020-05-11 23:55:43 Either way, best of luck with messing around with it devs : )
general 2020-05-11 23:55:57 Oh yeah
general 2020-05-11 23:57:39 Something I just remembered, has anybody suggested a way to copy paste blocks?
general 2020-05-12 00:01:09 Hey, if decals are being tossed around as an idea, then just have them as a block like the signs
general 2020-05-12 00:01:20 You cannot place overtop of them
general 2020-05-12 00:01:28 And limit the amount you can place
general 2020-05-12 00:02:34 Hey, no matter what you plan to do, I wish you the best of luck
general 2020-05-12 00:02:44 I hate when Roblox messes stuff up
general 2020-05-21 00:50:12 I am interested in how builds will look without outlines
general 2020-05-21 00:50:28 Quite interested indeed
general 2020-05-21 00:50:48 Well, some builds may look better to be honest
general 2020-05-21 00:55:24 Well, I will say that there are some builds that may benefit from the lack of outlines, however, there will also be plenty of builds that will "suffer" due to it
general 2020-05-21 00:56:10 Oooh XD
general 2020-05-21 00:56:39 True
general 2020-05-21 00:56:41 Hm
general 2020-05-21 00:57:26 If you dislike the look of the ship without the outlines, perhaps add some slight color variation? Such as a darker gray around the edges
general 2020-05-21 00:59:03 Well, I suppose we will just have to see where this whole ordeal goes
general 2020-08-06 00:46:16 Just curious, what exactly does the water jet do?
general 2020-08-06 00:46:39 Like, is it only for looks?
general 2020-08-06 00:47:07 Oh, ok, ty
general 2020-09-01 22:17:17 Uh, this is all I have, so idk how to tell
general 2020-09-01 22:17:31 If I may post pictures of course
general 2020-09-01 22:17:36 Is that ok?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 01:14:22 I just think the slimes looked cute and I wanted to make something that hops
creations-chat 2021-07-06 01:16:28 I thought it took effort, jeez. I just posted it because I was happy with how it turned out, guess I was wrong
