creations-chat 2019-12-15 23:50:59 Armored cruiser pothuau. It's not a battleship, it's not a cruiser. It's an armored cruiser.
creations-chat 2019-12-15 23:52:10 No, because we can call it a heavy cruiser if we want. But it's not one.

the-dump 2020-03-18 16:33:44 No, the thing is that you're going here to complain. People here dont give a fuck about what happened in our game.
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:34:04 It's not their problem, stop going on other discords to tell about this
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:34:53 I cant calm down cause you bother other people with problems that never Happened in CrazyPlane.
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:35:50 Crazyplane is Crazyplane, our game is our's. It's not the same game, not the same staff. So I say no to that. I dont have to argue here, if you want to, go in private. But dont bother another community.
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:36:44 You dont have to as well. It's not your problem dude, dont bother yourself for a kid.
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:37:30 I'm currently trying to fix something on our game, I dont have the time to continue that. It's a bottomless hole.
the-dump 2020-03-18 16:37:50 I dont see as well why he brings me here.
general 2020-05-13 15:26:15 What is the speaker ?

general 2020-05-13 15:28:05 So kinda local script ?
general 2020-05-13 15:29:00 <@318699736448106496> so with the speaker, others can't hear you ?
general 2020-05-13 15:29:52 They should update the horn... With a selectable sound such as -

Train, Boat, Truck and Car
general 2020-05-13 15:30:53 Its sad cause you can do very good things with speaker, such as playing vehicle sounds...

creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:41:06 <@!659802570474258500> As a French, I approve
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:20 Yes
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:27 Use ballast blocks in the tails
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:35 and set them up to 3.
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:42 If it's not enough, do 4
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:44 and balance
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:47 you will see
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:45:57 That what I did with the HE-111
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:46:17 Plus; you can hide some super rocket engine to make your plane fly faster
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:46:24 <@!541183450032373771>
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:46:34 Use ballast blocks
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:47:08 as well you can use ballast blocks in the engines, and set them to the lowest
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:47:22 because if ballast is under 1, it's lighter than a block
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:49:15 Dont use helium
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:49:25 Helium make your plane horrible to control

creations-chat 2020-05-18 18:40:21 I would like them to add some tiny tubes
creations-chat 2020-05-18 18:40:36 Or tubes you can resize
creations-chat 2020-05-18 18:43:22 <@!511559470376026135> you use speaker to do the machinegun sound ?

general 2020-05-20 09:35:14 And write the most toxic things you ever see
general 2020-05-20 09:35:29 Nah he doesn't do that
general 2020-05-20 09:35:39 He just down vote a perfect line of people
general 2020-05-20 09:36:41 Yes, sometimes it happens, or when you downvoted someone and he down votes every of your creations
