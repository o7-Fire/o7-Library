general 2020-04-18 06:59:29 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:46:25 are springs able to replace suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:47:44 looks like a no for the most part then
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:47:54 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:50:15 nope doesnt work

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:05:13 should i move the wheels down a bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:16:40 bruh i just realised that the cylinders stick together so that the motors cant turn them
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:16:48 is there a fix to this or do i have to redo it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:17:36 big rip
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:19:03 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 01:19:27 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:12:51 this might sound stupid but what does suspension dampening do?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:12:58 how would it affect builds?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:23:32 is there a way to prevent your wheels from spazzing out when u use suspension
help 2020-04-19 07:29:13 can anyone explain how to stop my wheels from spazzing out when i use suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:31:26 can anyone explain how to stop my wheels from spazzing out when i use suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:36:41 <@!263959626804887552> what do you mean by scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:36:46 the free length?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:38:11 <@!263959626804887552> oh its supposed to be a tiger tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:38:17 like 2:1 or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:38:50 no like
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:38:54 i have suspension connected to them
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:38:57 and the wheels just go crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:39:01 they shake and bounce around
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:27 https://gyazo.com/e774ecc6ce457e6fb97c1ebe55e08952
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:31 why do my tank wheels have a stroke

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:33 my tank's wheels keep spazzing out
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:51 free length is on 2, everything else is maxed
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:05:03 and thats for all suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:05:27 aight
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:09 still spazzes out
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:14 even worse this time
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:34 20 damping
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:39 60 stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:40 4.5 length
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:36 would the way i laid out the suspension be the problem?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:09:38 even worse now
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:09:43 i changed the stiffness to 40
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:16 i dont either it just goes crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:44 https://gyazo.com/bdeefd1cbca270fa867e86db1aaf50ba
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:46 help
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:52 stegg is there any alternative methods you'd lay out the suspension
general 2020-04-20 00:53:46 ok i realised i put it in the wrong chat
general 2020-04-20 00:53:48 but thanks anyway
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:42:04 tried my best to make a working mounted machinegun, is there any other ways that doesn't make this look garbage?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:42:39 ok so I'll just keep it like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:43:19 its my tanks only decent defense against aircraft in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:46:35 tiger 1 with guided missile sounds op
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:46:51 time to commit blitzkrieg
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:47:21 i shouldve built the tank larger
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:47:27 its hard to get details right if its small
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:49:35 so people keep thinking its another tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:57:05 is my tiger turret too small
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:57:43 bruh what
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:58:12 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:58:13 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:42:49 is there a way to automatically make a block a certain color when you place it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:42:56 or do you have to recolor it every time
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:43:13 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:43:40 thats pretty weird tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:46:18 im just gonna assume it already got suggested because i'm too lazy

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 09:59:35 ok how do i make it look more like an a10
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:21 what should I do to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:40 heres an upclose image
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:52 cornerwedges?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:02:52 looks like an ISIS vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:01 nothing
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:05 it looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:12 maybe a bit of paint though
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:30 idk lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:24 what about blue camo or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:43

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:58 also how does the nose look now
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:06 nah i got a ton of reference photos
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:18 and some examples from other a10s people built
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:20 looks pretty simple
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:30 cockpit is the most frustrating part so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:16:42 i feel u man
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:16:50 cockpits are a pain in the neck
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:17:14 exo are u familiar with A10s
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:17:39 or building similar aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:13 hey normies
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:16 quick question bro
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:25 should i move the wings up?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:22:38 no i'll figure the functional stuff out later
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:22:53 yes or no though
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:24:08 
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:24:20 does it look fine from this angle
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:25:10 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:26:28 there goes my ego
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:36:45 wait pyro are you still there?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:09 how would i fix my a10 wing being too low
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:15 but if i put it one block higher it'd be unrealistic
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:36 ur gonna have to explain that to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:55 ok ty
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:10 i had a tank with the same problem, i just maxed out damping and stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:16 it helps a lot
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:21 ok then idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:13:52 also is there a way to unlock a locked motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:09 made my first railgun
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:32 explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:41 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:58 if i try make the railgun mobile then the vehicle would spazz out
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:19:07 everytime i shoot
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:19:43 good idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:24:59 why isnt this blowing up on impact
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:25:50 wait im not on pvp
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:26:28 also another question what does ignore self do?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:27:42 ok and what does arm on key do
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:27:54 since I was thinking that it'd blow it up when you pressed the button but that's already like that by default
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:19 whats the difference between having physics on and unanchoring the block
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:54 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:55 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:51:51 yo guys hows my a10 looking so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:28 i heard that so many people made a10s that people just downvote them for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:34 is that true
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:45 is mine a bad a10
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:14 if you had a choice to downvote or upvote
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:17 what would it be
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:44 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:54:12 i'll just assume that my a10 is average
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:03:15 which jet engine should i use
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:03:52 i havent made a custom jet engine before
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:13:46 huge jet engine looks fine to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:15:51 epic
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 02:48:53 does locking pistons do nothing?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:03:00 does this concentrate all of its mass into the center of the block or what
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:07:25 i dont understand how the block is changed if this is on
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:10:09 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:10:38 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:19:14 im slapping full density ballasts on one end and helium blocks on the other but i dont feel like its moving the CoM arrow by much, any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:19:41 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:20:25 this is gonna be
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:20:27 very fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:15 guil do you know how much density a normal block and helium block has?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:42 ok ty
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:46 what about helium
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:24:52 nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:25:04 wait hold on what
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:01 im so stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:08 i spammed helium on one end of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:15 and i didnt know why it kept flipping upside down
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:26:24 yo guys what do you think
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:26:31 still working on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:11 i've seen better too
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:19 pyro's one is the best
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:31 then who
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:52 just keep trying different arrangements of triangles/wedges i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:28:01 then you'll just find one that clicks perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:29:10 holy jesus thats so good
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:14:47 how do you put decals on your vehicles?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:15:26 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:15:31 so they aren't decals
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:17:31 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:24:52 what happened to my jet engine sounds
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:05 my jet engine sounds like someone screaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:07 can someone explain
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:23 is this an easter egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:52:19 so many braincells lost in one image
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 09:03:37 out of 30 votes how many of them do u think would be downvotes

creations-chat 2020-04-21 09:10:23 
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:39:32 is impact speed the speed it takes for the block to explode or what?

help 2020-07-17 02:28:25 680
help 2020-07-17 02:28:49 680 and thats just the treads, prolly gonna lag a lot more once i build the entire thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:35:46 is there a way to stop roblox physics slowing down when I test my tank?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:36:09 no

help 2020-07-23 10:12:27 my heli keeps spinning uncontrollably from the rotors, rn I'm trying to use the tail rotor to cancel out the spinning effect but it's not enough. is there any good solution to this?
help 2020-07-23 10:13:04 tail rotor speed is all maxed out while main rotor speed is at a bare 10, not even enough to fly
help 2020-07-23 10:18:37 yea won't work, heli keeps spinning even if i make the rotor disproportionately small
help 2020-07-23 10:19:28 
help 2020-07-23 10:20:07 tail's got 2 rotors at max speed, i thought that'd be more than enough to counteract the spinning
help 2020-07-23 10:20:15 yea
help 2020-07-23 11:47:55 bruh is there even a way to fit a swashplate in here

plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:08:58 anyone else experience an issue where other builds go invisible if you shoot them with a gun enough?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:18 because on my screen i just light up other creations with gunfire
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:23 then their build just goes invisible
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:46 and of course out of nowhere I end up dying to invisible rocket and gun spam
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:11:36 how do I avoid this happening?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:12:33 also is this an issue on my end or the game's?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:13:03 ah alright

creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:00:54 ok I want to ask, why is it important to have a girlfriend when you haven’t even finished school?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:08:34 don’t you guys just hate it when you’re working on a build then you see someone’s post of a way superior version
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:08:51 ego goes mega flop
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:11:47 you guys don’t lag with creations of that size?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:12:18 I’ve never decided to build large creations again since it lags pretty hard
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:12:29 idk it’s from the sheer amount of moving parts or my pc
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:13:09 same
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:13:22 just uh
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:17:45 “low-effort build” is an insult to actual low effort builds

creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:28:55 ego is now down to 0%
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:30:49 chunky
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:31:27 is it worth getting roles for my builds?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:31:34 im too lazy to request
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:32:21 imagine playing on mobile
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:32:51 yea my pc isnt that good
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:33:10 its above your work-tier pcs but below gaming-tier
creations-chat 2020-07-30 00:34:33 that would take 3x longer than pc

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:53:46 i rejoin
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:48:13 0/10 not enough shredder bugs
general 2020-08-04 09:58:16 well
general 2020-08-04 09:58:26 the people who use shredder bugs are garbage builders
general 2020-08-04 09:58:42 all the shredder bugs I've been seeing lately are just yt tutorials lmao
general 2020-08-04 10:00:59 i've seen tournaments on yt
general 2020-08-04 10:01:12 well wouldn't call them tournaments
general 2020-08-04 10:01:59 well if pvp tournaments were using stuff you had to build on the spot
general 2020-08-04 10:02:04 then the shredder bug spam would be insane
general 2020-08-04 10:02:22 cancer
general 2020-08-04 10:47:29 why not make a roomba
general 2020-08-04 10:48:08 that's a good enough reason
general 2020-08-04 10:49:10 the last shitpost I saw was a tutorial plane
general 2020-08-04 10:49:25 and that guy got absolutely annihilated by the community
general 2020-08-04 10:49:48 no
general 2020-08-04 10:49:51 like a full on tutorial plane
general 2020-08-04 10:50:35 big brain
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 04:42:08 yea in this game making good helis is too difficult to be worth it
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 04:42:19 stuff like swashplates take a large amount of space
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 04:42:56 is it heavier on one side
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 04:43:09 send a pic of ur rocket
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 04:45:37 if that doesnt work try spreading out the thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 07:54:24 yo would it be possible to make this fly without gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 07:55:11 f
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 13:04:53 the post?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 13:05:00 ok done
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 13:05:16 quick question though, are those sorts of builds punishable?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 13:51:48 ur rotor creates too much torque force for the tail rotor to counteract
creations-chat 2020-08-08 13:53:28 what do you guys think about the front portion of my forward unto dawn?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 13:53:42 prolly gonna have 3-4 folds

plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:46 you should build a plane first tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:57 easier for beginners than tanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:04:25 that is the best idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:04:29 i’ve heard

creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:29:09 problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:29:13 how good you make the blimp look
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:29:57 ur blimp needs improvement
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:03 even though its not finished
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:13 cos its gonna ruin the entire build and get people to downvote
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:19 even though the bridge looks good
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:20 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:45 could fit in well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:51 building steampunk theme is hard though
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:30:56 at least for me
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:31:38 lots of halo builds
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:31:56 saw a pelican, a couple of warthogs, a scorpion and forward unto dawn all in the span of 3 days
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:33:19 light or blocks

creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:08:13 magic carpet with bombs
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:59:27 "I hate locked motors because I don't know how they work!"
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:59:53 how did they break your stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:02:02 1.) move servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:02:06 2.) fix your internet
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:04:55 locked motor academy isnt useful because it only shows examples and doesnt explain how they work
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:05:09 to be good at using locked motors you need to understand specific patterns with them
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:05:33 bruh just make a giant ground turret with maxed guns, rockets, flamethrower and fireworks if you have them
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:05:38 best counter to shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:06:05 also make sure you make a wall of explode on impact tnt around your turret so when shredder bugs try get to you they die
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:06:29 <@456226577798135808> warthogs are more overrated than a10s
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:07:07 or just build your own shredder bug army
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:07:14 to outcancer the cancer
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:07:57 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:07:57 2 hours
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:08:14 how many hours do u have intotal
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:12:37 um no
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:12:56 he doesnt make the game for himself to play
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:13:03 its mostly for other people
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:13:56 what year are we getting explosive cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:14:24 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:14:42 it better have half block 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:15:09 yes i do
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:15:15 my build needs it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:15:21 im literally motorlocking for it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:15:33 i only want half of 1x2 not a full 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:15:49 yea thats what im doing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:16:00 but its more convenient for it to be an actual block
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:17:47 you must understand the ways of the church of motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:18:20 only then will your build get you good roles
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:19:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:19:35 clearly you havent seen the things people do with them
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:19:50 e.g compressing blocks, creating tension with suspension, making new blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:20:23 because pog
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:28:53 just make sure the yellow part points towards the front of the build
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:29:21 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:33:47 the guns directly infront of the motor are causing it not to move
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:33:58 its welding to the base part of the motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:34:30 not u
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:35:10 the ones above too
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:35:13 yea
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:36:09 thats motorlocking for you
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:36:21 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:36:36 i saw their build version tanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:36:43 a ton of locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:36:51 just need a lot of thought and experience
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 13:37:16 it’ll come to you the more u build
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:43:24 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:46:54 that rule didnt even exist back then
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:49:21 nerf cutter and no more shredder
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:49:30 ez
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:49:45 if u wanna get banned sure
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:50:49 step 2 only works if u got low ping
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:51:33 or you can do step 3. make your own shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:51:43 anti shredder bug shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:52:06 its ok you’re not going to destroy anyone else except the shredder
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:52:33 just make like 10 shredder bugs all with guns, rockets and flamethrowers
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:52:44 until the shredder user ragequits
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:53:22 gn
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:54:04 would on-impact explosive blocks as armor kill shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:55:33 yea non pvp is the way to go
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:56:31 for me pvp is only fun on the vip servers
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:56:55 otherwise you’d see half the server building missiles and shredders
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:57:10 and turrets with maxed out weapons
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:12:21 u dont need to blow ur missile up
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:12:28 just add a cutter to the front
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:12:30 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:13:07 my main counter to shredder bugs is a tutorial helicopter with maxed guns
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:13:11 and flamethrowers
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:13:29 cos my actual builds arent meant to pvp
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 14:13:44 well not pvp effectively anyway
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:52:56 heliboat
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:58:01 use pontoons
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:58:16 their specific purpose is to make things float

plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:03:08 people who do that are the same type of people to make shredder bugs, lag bombs and smoke machines
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:03:46 u guys should get ranked
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:03:55 it gives u access to free vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:04:40 fair

creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:26 use triangle wedges
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:49 and motorlock stuff if u need to

creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:32:54 if u can
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:33:57 is this supposed to be a replica
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:34:01 or just based off it
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:34:10 cos theres some big differences
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:36:03 show a pic of the tail in flight mode
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:37:59 also i know how the chopper has only 1 set of rotors but with ur lower rotor try making it less chonky
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:38:10 *if possible* also lower the rotors
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:40:19 if the lower rotors dont serve any purpose (not sure since i cant see if they have motorlocked wings in them) might aswell get rid of them
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:42:08 explosive cylinder and half block 1x2 when
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:01 there already is
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:13 half ball
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:22 which is sphere
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:28 oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:45 fuel should be removed tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:43:51 no one uses it
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:44:08 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:44:14 p2w
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:44:37 yes but not by killing off  the game by making p2w
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:03 with higher build height u get bigger and better builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:16 what about giving cutter hp
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:18 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:32 cutter can only kill 10 blocks before being destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:38 make it that way
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:45:46 just nerf cutter by giving it hp
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:46:06 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:47:06 same
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:48:01 i also tried using cutters for an armored piercing projectile except it just bounced off other builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:49:11 its just a non explosive missile with a cutter on the end
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:49:45 rocket needs speed buff
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:50:14 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:50:53 well uh roblox throttles my aircraft down to 25%
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:51:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:51:47 rick needs to reduce throttling if possible
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:53:18 tail seems too long
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:53:27 other than that it looks good
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 01:00:28 nerf cutter when
general 2020-08-15 01:01:33 lua is a programming language
general 2020-08-15 01:01:48 roblox uses a slightly altered version of it
general 2020-08-15 01:02:58 pretty simple understanding basic concepts of lua but mastering it takes years
general 2020-08-15 01:03:27 ^

creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:42:24 whats with all these people building unsc frigates that arent scaled correctly
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:45:05 like dont get me wrong it looks good but you might aswell call it a custom frigate
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:47:01 not drama just criticism
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:47:44 i’ve recently been seeing unsc frigates with parts too long, too short, too wide etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:31:52 are we talking about the uboat?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:32:15 cos whoever made it needs to replace the flag with an iron cross
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:32:34 the boat is good but flag nono
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:05 personally I dont care about the flag but it breaks rules
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:23 This is roblox not COD WAW
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:32 this game is for kids
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:47 im all for historical accuracy
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:36:00 the only problem with the flag is that this server doesnt allow it
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:36:40 tbh though this flag is more appropriate
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:42:37 talking about nono flags, is the communist equivalent also banned?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:11 well the third reich flag is banned
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:20 and soviets killed more people
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:38 death to nasis and communists
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:44:05 iron cross is allowed

bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:48:30 rick censored their scam messages with “<— scammer”
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:58:35 ok rick screwed up censorship then

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:05:23 reports dont work and neither do lag machines
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:05:33 roblox automatically throttles physics
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:05:59 extremely weak devices
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:06:24 bro people on mobile play this fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:06:50 the most powerful lag machine i’ve seen is an actual build in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:07:48 with lag machines roblox just throttles its physics
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:08:01 to like
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:08:04 10%
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:08:49 lag machines are pretty tame compared to vip1 builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:09:36 i’d rather have 5 lag machines in my server at once than toot’s UNSC infinity spawn in
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:14 tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:20 I’ve never seen any that affect me
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:25 not yet anyway
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:44 yeah vip1 lags
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:24 depends on the players that join
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:31 if like 3 master ranks join
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:34 rip server
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:12:00 no its cos the players are good
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:12:06 and build huge creations
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:12:16 rather than wasting their time spamming blocks

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:27:58 shredder bug premium
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:28:21 folding becomes ez after 1 or 2 builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:30:16 idk bot’s probably down

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:32:59 ur shredder bug is the only one i wouldnt mind fighting
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:33:07 all other ones are just cancer yt tutorials
creations-chat 2020-08-16 23:34:04 yes
general 2020-08-17 01:09:02 ok
general 2020-08-17 01:15:52 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:25:14 the best part about that tutorial build is the entirety of the tutorial itself
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:25:21 barrel looks stupid
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:26:23 that barrel is too big
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:26:28 and muzzle break is disproportionate
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:07 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:13 it should have tutorials for all vehicles
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:26 well vehicle types
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:28:13 it should also have tutorials on slightly more advanced block types
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:28:20 such as springs, magnets and suspension
general 2020-08-17 03:29:32 literally anything in this game is antitank
general 2020-08-17 03:29:57 not hard
general 2020-08-17 03:30:22 no dont give them ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:19 they should add cannons, basically nonexplosive rockets except the rockets travel faster and have bullet drop
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:33 cannons just punch through builds rather than blowing up
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:53 basically
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:33:04 except an actual pvp weapon
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:33:44 only problem with magnet powered guns is that they lag
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:02 and they take up a lot of space
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:14 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:48 it would be cool if rockets were affected by magnets
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:54 so u could accelerate them
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:36:19 or if they made railguns an actual pvp weapon
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:03 railguns with 3x1x2 size or something
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:09 longer reload than rocket
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:18 but penetrates 3 blocks into builds
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:38:27 magnets make most reliable railguns
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:38:47 oh no
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:39:04 aka piston
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:39:19 piston except toggled
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:40:35 if u want to make it now before rick releases ingame moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:21 make sure it has no references to actual labour camps though
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:34 like, no stuff about gulags and concentration camps for safety
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:01 u can make one its just a tough road to navigate without getting banned
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:09 or warned
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:32 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:44 and people still posting tutorial builds
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:57 not released yet
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:43:04 either next update or one after
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:43:24 just make a camp except dont make it german or soviet themed
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:43:54 yea idk about NK
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:44:03 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:46:05 mega stiff
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:47:24 also damping is just how much shock the spring can absorb
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:47:33 suspension*
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:47:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:49:56 you can also describe it as how quick it resists impact and goes to rest
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:50:23 for example if damping is 1/100 the suspension will keep bouncing upon impact for a while
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:51:17 while if its full 100/100 the amount of time its bouncing and having a seizure is drastically reduced
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:52:09 imagine having radio
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:52:51 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:53:13 tbh i want to buy radio to blast halo music from my frigate
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:53:27 except not worth it since my acc is about to run out of save space
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:54:15 if only infinite save data was possible
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:04:17 correction
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:04:24 pcc only likes good tanks
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:04:32 have you seen herr’s and puri’s tanks?
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:06:09 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:41:19 bruh 3 days and running out of save space
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:41:59 either thats a lie or ur just autoclicking blocks on a plot
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:43:08 yeah true didnt think about that
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:43:33 10 times is pretty excessive though
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:44:57 damn that ship is hall of fame material
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:45:40 it doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:45:52 it's so good that it should transcend the barrier between discord and non-discord users
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:47:48 nah it needs like 10 guns at the front
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:48:04 also severe lack of cutters
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:48:33 it could be better if he put 10 guns at front
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 06:48:35 yes
general 2020-08-17 07:38:37 does 4 blocks take up more save data than a block beam
general 2020-08-17 07:39:25 yeah same
general 2020-08-17 07:49:45 did I hear unde
general 2020-08-17 07:50:36 imagine playing fps games on roblox

general 2020-08-19 05:01:06 boom
general 2020-08-19 05:01:13 samsung moment
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:02:36 tbh though
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:02:41 it's not his fault that there's undes in this server
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:03:02 the undes themselves are breaking rules
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:03:41 we adjust by banning them
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:04:34 if only undes didn't join this server
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:04 nothing
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:10 that's why it's an "if"
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:45 i reckon the undes that hide it well deserve to stay though no matter if they're an unde
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:03 well we won't know if theyre unde
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:04 since they're hiding it
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:14 and if they're hiding it well they aren't as immature and stupid as other undes
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:34 yeah
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:41 if they get caught
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:42 <:BanHammer:507685761496252420>
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:53 like
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:07:01 if you're that dumb to reveal you're underage on this server
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:07:03 you deserve to get banned
general 2020-08-19 05:34:33 whats even worse than him posting the image is him using light mode
general 2020-08-19 05:35:10 warn him again for light mode
general 2020-08-19 06:53:55 this is why undes arent allowed
creations-chat 2020-08-19 06:58:32 another requirement for expert is doing no low-effort builds

help 2020-09-06 01:32:50 is roblox throttling your plane's physics
help 2020-09-06 01:33:21 cos lowering graphics does almost nothing when trying to get roblox to stop slowing down ur build

general 2020-09-06 04:17:47 yes
general 2020-09-06 04:18:28 in star wars death star is as useless as ratte

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:01:48 oh ic why it wont fly now
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:02:23 probably multiple reasons but a big one is that the center of weight is further ahead than the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:02:41 thats gonna make ur plane keep tilting downward
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:03:04 nah
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:03:08 just as close as possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:08:03 yea I also noticed the plane has huge flaps
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:08:56 a bit
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:09:05 its taking up the actual wing space
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:09:21 those flaps are overkill for your plane as far as I can tell
general 2020-09-22 23:13:03 yea every scp sl player can agree scp robreach unbalanced as hell
general 2020-09-22 23:13:21 imagine adding like 10 factions without considering balancing

creations-chat 2020-10-04 22:30:24 posting a tutorial in creations chat is the most dishonourable thing that can be done on this server, btw that tree looks amazing

general 2020-10-05 22:11:29 i mean ejecting is a better chance of survival than crashing into the ground in a metal coffin at speeds way higher

general 2020-10-07 01:22:19 yes perhaps roblox servers are behind that door
general 2020-10-07 01:22:29 that would explain why they’re garbage

general 2020-10-08 12:39:44 yeah now the chinese are overpopulating australia and soon the entirety of the country is gonna be speaking chinese
general 2020-10-08 12:40:17 i come from a chinese background
general 2020-10-08 12:40:26 but I have to agree that mass migration is an issue
general 2020-10-08 12:40:40 china is holding australian politics by the necj right now
general 2020-10-08 12:41:07 its not so much the people themselves
general 2020-10-08 12:41:12 but the influence
general 2020-10-08 12:41:22 yea it was an exaggeration
general 2020-10-08 12:42:25 yes
general 2020-10-08 12:43:12 why is facebook still a thing
general 2020-10-08 12:43:21 i thought it died years ago

creations-chat 2020-10-08 12:49:46 no it wouldnt be too small
creations-chat 2020-10-08 12:50:22 carrier is ez but time consuming
creations-chat 2020-10-08 12:50:45 nah some more than others
creations-chat 2020-10-08 12:51:44 carriers are lame and overrated now tbh
general 2020-10-08 12:53:15 how is bobux even a meme
general 2020-10-08 12:54:47 free robux 3301
general 2020-10-08 12:56:43 any simulator is just a cheap attempt at making a cashcow that appeals to kids
general 2020-10-08 12:57:35 no I mean simulator in the shitty repetitive roblox simulator sense
general 2020-10-08 12:58:11 at the point where u have to literally not play the game to progress theres no point in playing
general 2020-10-08 12:59:37 someone should make plague.inc in roblox
general 2020-10-08 13:00:33 yes but come on we already have roblox among us, roblox fortnite and roblox minecraft
general 2020-10-08 13:00:53 roblox plague inc needs to be a thing too
general 2020-10-08 13:01:01 we also have roblox cod and battlefield
general 2020-10-08 13:02:22 coronavirus simulator
general 2020-10-08 13:02:43 roblox league of legends
general 2020-10-08 13:04:37 sorry sir this is a no trap zone
general 2020-10-08 13:05:37 have you guys seen roblox scp sl
general 2020-10-08 13:06:32 at least roblox half life isnt garbage
general 2020-10-08 13:07:27 roblox scp sl devs tried to make the game too different despite it being a blatant ripoff so now the end result is a trash game with absolutely no balancing and features with little attention to detail
general 2020-10-08 13:08:27 while they might be good at coding now they still make stupid decisions
general 2020-10-08 13:08:38 like whats the point of adding like 10 factions
general 2020-10-08 13:08:47 it makes the game extremely hard to balance
general 2020-10-08 13:10:03 tbh all people with anime pics are probably traps
general 2020-10-08 13:10:53 oh yes we also have roblox csgo and roblox r6s
general 2020-10-08 13:12:19 wkwkwkwkwkwk is the sound a helicopter makes

general 2020-10-09 00:03:49 “and has this build”
general 2020-10-09 00:03:57 why do you need to mention his build then
general 2020-10-09 00:04:32 stalin never called himself a mass murderer
general 2020-10-09 00:05:08 yea i mentioned the square moustache man but i got warned
general 2020-10-09 00:05:14 so stalin is next candidate
general 2020-10-09 00:06:31 yes
general 2020-10-09 00:07:00 rick literally had to improve on roblox chat filter because despite chat filter being so strict they fail at blocking spam bots
general 2020-10-09 00:08:12 problem isnt the chinese people themselves, its that the country is a goddamn mess
general 2020-10-09 00:09:12 i like how adolf’s last name is censored yet fuck isnt

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:28:58 correction
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:29:00 *actual helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:29:10 most of the time people just put jets
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:29:18 and coaxial rotors because they don't know how to put a single set of rotors
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:29:57 no swashplates or anything
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:30:11 compact swashplates are
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:30:20 and thats what you need most of the time
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:31:02 bro
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:31:33 or u can tilt the entire rotor system itself
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:31:35 with a motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:31:43 so basically you just made a poor man's swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:32:19 or you can put jets/rockets on the inside of the heli
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:32:29 oh forgot
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:34:17 horizontal
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:34:30 vertical is if you want it to turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:34:34 but you got the rear rotor for that
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:35:12 swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:35:41 if u dont do swash
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:35:46 then do coaxial rotor
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:36:18 rocket power rotor ugly
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:36:27 i dont know why people do it

Do you just wake up in the morning and think "wow, I really feel like a massive fucking stone today"? It's useless. I hate it. It just provokes a deep rooted anger within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and kill it. If this was the emoji movie I'd push it off a fucking cliff. People just comment 🗿 as if it's funny. It's not. 🗿 deserves to die. He deserves to have his smug little stone face smashed in with a hammer. Oh wow, it's a stone head, how fucking hilarious, I'll use it in every comment I post. NO. STOP IT. It deserves to burn in hell. Why is it so goddamn smug. You're a fucking stone, you have no life goals, you will never accomplish anything in life apart from pissing me off. When you die noone will mourn. I hope you die.

creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:31:47 some people like comparing builds but that isn't inherently bad at all, that's actually a good thing so that pcc has actual standards.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:34:03 also it's not like people downvote just because someone's version of a build is slightly worse than someone else's build. people upvote/downvote on whether or not the build is good.

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:22:56 either back part of plane is too short
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:22:57 wings are wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:23:04 or cockpit needs to be moved up a bit

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:24:42 actually
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:24:49 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:25:03 but you can try motorlock the wings to make a better angle
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:25:07 if ur willing to do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:25:38 its good
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:25:42 scale is slightly off
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:25:44 but thats ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:26:15 i might make a bf109 too
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:26:36 was planning on doing that a couple days ago aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:26:43 yea propeller is hardest bit

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:32:41 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 23:32:51 also rick said we'd get new wedges after he recodes

general 2021-02-14 10:43:43 ok so then why should someone make alts, and buy gamepasses for each of them just because theres a lack of save slots

<@!718006867808485447> thanks, anywhere else?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:33:08 i've never seen a stug with sideskirts carry logs

<@!714878625484243101> yea antennas, not all tanks had them. i can't fit them in with the amount of motorlock i have towards that section area so yeah. anything else though?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:42:19 not perfect enough, never is. i will continue to keep adding onto it until the sheer amount of motorlock stops me from doing so
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:44:21 yea, i thought so too
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:48:12 <@!447721322072506369> mid chassis is looking good enough, the red area i marked highlights the awkwardly large gap between the wheels and chassis. front portion of the car looks unrealistically flimsy. image quality is pretty bad tbh, i could see the pixels pretty easily. also you could use some gradient (ex: darker towards bottom of the buggy to simulate dirt)

creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:59:32 i like it so far, try making top deck darker and/or change the material to slate. gradient on rest of the hull would be nice too
creations-chat 2021-02-18 12:02:42 yea you could add more depth to the sides with a door handle or something
general 2021-02-18 12:09:08 probably wont break unless the parts are already defective

bug-reports 2021-02-18 12:40:05 dont think its a bug
creations-chat 2021-02-18 12:43:13 not a stuh, i’d probably reduce the transmission area length if i could but that would mean undoing hours of motorlock
creations-chat 2021-02-18 12:45:23 cant do that either, theres too much motorlock to change the shape of the chassis
creations-chat 2021-02-18 12:48:40 i think it’ll be alr though. i’ll add some gradient, touch up the muzzle and see how it looks from there

creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:12:41 World doesn’t revolve around you bub, no one cares on how much time you spent on the build. The upvote and downvote system is centered around other people giving an opinion on your build, and that means they don’t like your build. So how about you stop whining and take this as an opportunity to improve. Stop acting so entitled.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:15:39 If you can’t accept criticism then it’s better you cry to the fortnite community.

creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:48:48 dont think many people would be wondering why their first build got downvoted into oblivion
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:50:49 “are yall just downvoting my spaceship because of the argument?” lol
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:55:58 saying a build sucks is a form of criticism, that means one does not enjoy looking at your build. Essentially it means the entire build is not up to par.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:58:45 if you really wanted help with specific details then go to <#384021699466756107>  or <#478584971670454284> , posting it in <#384025409945337856> then whining about why its getting downvoted does not help at all

general 2021-04-02 11:30:28 he's probably in 5th grade do u even think he can read
general 2021-04-02 11:31:52 i dont even think hes 13 tbh
general 2021-04-02 11:36:35 bland
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:23:12 wtf is that barrel
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:07 ngl
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:11 lasers sound dumb
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:38 because the fact that theres no travel time at all already makes it op
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:42 builds that rely on speed are useless
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:46 and you can snipe builds from across the map
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:55 lasers travel at the speed of light
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:24:58 are you sure its a laser
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:25:29 they arent even lasers
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:25:30 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:26:28 how fast is this weapon you're proposing gonna be?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:26:35 faster than a firework?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:01 yea but thing is
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:05 you're literally proposing an op firework
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:07 as a weapon
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:36 fireworks already have limited range and probably less speed than lasers
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:41 and recoil doesnt matter for a lot of builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:44 u can just anchor
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:47 the entire creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:27:59 bro
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:28:09 the weapon is literally a firework with unlimited range then
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:28:14 no point
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:28:22 not unlimited?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:28:30 ok so basically you're proposing a firework with recoil
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:28:35 good suggestion 👍
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:14 a better weapon would be a kinetic based weapon
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:19 since we dont have any of those yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:25 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:35 closest thing we got is launching cutters out of magnet powered barrels
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:55 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:29:55 guns need buff
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:30:06 you gotta motorlock a bunch of them together to even do anything
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:30:55 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:30:59 weight doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:31:20 or helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:31:21 or rockets
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:31:24 or whatever your build needs
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:31:28 shouldnt be hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:32:31 you edit the motor and set powered to off, and lock to on
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:32:48 what this does is retracts whatever the motor is connected to by half a block
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 12:33:10 just go on yt, lots of helpful vids

plane-crazy 2021-04-03 23:26:14 why would you build something and decide not to include part of the actual vehicle in

plane-crazy 2021-04-03 23:27:40 bottom front part is sloped upwards

general 2021-04-04 11:23:07 but it just gets repetitive
general 2021-04-04 11:23:42 the game is alr but with all these newer roblox fps games, its finding it harder to compete

creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:12:40 bro i wasnt even talking about your build
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:14:45 how did you get it up into the sky and turn on lights in build mode, that build is clearly close to height limit. someone explain what black magic fuckery is going on

plane-crazy 2021-04-14 07:34:56 pvp is gay
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 07:42:56 1x1 blocks > 1x7s
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 07:43:14 1x7 will die to rocket and it will leave a 1x7 gap in your armor
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 07:43:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:33:57 because roblox mods are fat men with little education that are outsourced from india
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:34:22 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:34:28 they still got their main mods
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:34:33 but they outsource mods too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:35:34 offensive to slow people <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:37:40 one time i got warned for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:37:43 there was no offensive item
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:37:49 they didnt give a reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:37:52 they literally just warned

general 2021-04-15 03:02:04 mobile or not
general 2021-04-15 03:02:07 it's always unfair to use shaders

creations-chat 2021-04-20 02:54:19 im black
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:57:30 yea but what if we want to assume roblox characters are life sized
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:27 but average human height is around 1,75
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:45 so 35 centimetres per stud
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:00:41 170cm for simplicity’s sake
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:01:03 170/5 is 34 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:01:54 1/0.34 gives us 2.94 studs in a meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:02:44 mach 1 is 343 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:03:13 so mach 1 in pcc would be around 1008 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:07:59 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:08:33 bro
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:09:58 5 studs is roblox character height
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:10:07 u just do 2/5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:00 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:09 roblox character height is 5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:45 u dont need block measurement
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:51 just roblox character height
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:12:10 2/5 is 0.4 cm per stud
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:12:43 1/0.4 means there is 2.5 studs in a meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:13:19 mach 1 is 343 m/s so 343x2.5 = 857.5 sps in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:13:27 theres ur answer <@!582834773773254656>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:15:30 m/s*
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:15:56 km/h to sps would be harder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:16:11 m/s to sps is easier since both use seconds
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:16:44 alternatively u can do km/h / 3.6 to get m/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:16:54 then convert to sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:20:18 1/(1.7/5) x sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:20:26 i think this could work
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:20:47 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:23:29 yea I probably went wrong
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:23:40 i’ll head off now

creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:33:28 ok should i make it wider though
creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:48:19 i disagree
creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:50:46 you need to balance test your plane on multiple occasions, find a good way to control pitch, roll and yaw and most planes i've come across are pretty compact builds which makes it harder to motorlock or have locks. a good plane typically needs multiple custom angles (and perhaps on the wings aswell which adds some variability to flight performance)

creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:18:57 so you said people prefer astrocraft to this yet you’re saying most people leave? funny how you think a game with 60 concurrent players even stands up against one with thousands
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:21:02 F3X is roblox studio building in the form of a tool and for that reason its supposed to be more complex. its like saying “i prefer [insert building game] to minecraft because its more complex”
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:24:31 yea thats totally irrelevant to what I said, besides its like comparing apples to oranges. oh both are fruits therefore one *must* be better right? stop applying that logic to these games. we both know it makes no sense and that the games apply to seperate audiences
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:28:31 hof
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:32:47 you still try to compare a game involving **actual 3d modelling sourced from roblox studio itself** and one where the game is supposed to be simple yet your build in that game gets absolutely shitted on in comparison to some of the builds our community has

plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:40:51 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:42:14 so apparently he's 15 but he's too scared to prove his age

plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:45:49 underage
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:54:53 faces are generally unde
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:55:40 ;-; is pretty unde too
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:56:53 we don't say that here
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 09:57:11 ur mom
general 2021-05-02 09:58:15 damn bro
general 2021-05-02 09:58:17 i was watching that
general 2021-05-02 09:58:25 deleted it midway through
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:10:27 its around 3000
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:11:54 m/s x 2.94 = sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:12:03 i got the equation from 1/(1.7/5)
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:12:23 0.28 isnt far off
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:12:28 so 3000+ is mach3
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:13:20 [1 stud]/([average human height]/[roblox stud height])
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:13:25 1/(1.7/5)
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:13:35 so if we put 1.7 we get 2.97
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:14:04 roblox wiki assumes that humans are 1.8m+ on average
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:14:07 obviously thats not the case
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:17:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:20:46 <@!737466938279591946> out of the world population 3000 adolescents die a day on average, roblox has 32.6m daily active users. 7.7 billion divided by 32.6m means that on average 236 roblox players die daily
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:21:52 actually i probably messed up my calc
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:21:54 im gonna afk for a bit
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:26:04 like hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:32:25 i fixed my calculations
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:32:52 <@!737466938279591946> 

About 3000 adolescents die every day, this means 0.000039% of all adolescents die a day. Adolescents make up most of the roblox playerbase therefore it is fair to assume that 0.000039% of the playerbase dies daily. Roblox has 32.6m daily active users, this means that around 13 roblox players die daily.
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 10:33:16 Over a year thats 4745 people

general 2021-05-03 10:17:06 imo
general 2021-05-03 10:17:08 13 is still pretty unde
general 2021-05-03 10:17:39 why do people even do language
general 2021-05-03 10:18:12 what grade are you allowed to drop it
general 2021-05-03 10:18:20 ^
general 2021-05-03 10:18:24 bro
general 2021-05-03 10:18:29 we could drop language in year 9
general 2021-05-03 10:19:00 i didnt even do a language
general 2021-05-03 10:19:15 i started year 7 doing some extra english in place of a language
general 2021-05-03 10:19:29 never did a language since then
general 2021-05-03 10:19:58 german is probably easiest
general 2021-05-03 10:20:01 because its closest to english
general 2021-05-03 10:20:56 meant to say that english is closest to german
general 2021-05-03 10:21:00 not the other way around
general 2021-05-03 10:21:21 really
general 2021-05-03 10:21:44 yea french seems more different
general 2021-05-03 10:21:55 i'd say german is closer than french
general 2021-05-03 10:22:16 thats why its more different
general 2021-05-03 10:23:35 yea
general 2021-05-03 10:23:46 i picked up cooking classes for the last couple years
general 2021-05-03 10:23:48 for free food
general 2021-05-03 10:24:02 p.e
general 2021-05-03 10:24:21 you got dance?
general 2021-05-03 10:24:29 doesnt that technically go under pe though
general 2021-05-03 10:25:04 its still pretty useless
general 2021-05-03 10:25:42 in my school we're forced to do 1 class of PE and theres other optional PE classes
general 2021-05-03 10:25:48 that 1 class of PE is enough
general 2021-05-03 10:26:01 i'd rather learn another subject than have another PE class
general 2021-05-03 10:27:14 whats the point though
general 2021-05-03 10:27:21 pretty useless unless you're a historian or something
general 2021-05-03 10:27:57 whats creativity
general 2021-05-03 10:28:02 i've never heard of that subject
general 2021-05-03 10:28:08 is it art
general 2021-05-03 10:28:45 hes already lurking
general 2021-05-03 10:29:41 why are you talking about winnie the pooh
general 2021-05-03 10:30:47 imagine doing arts
general 2021-05-03 10:30:57 why are u doing music then
general 2021-05-03 10:31:15 really?
general 2021-05-03 10:31:21 do you get any elective subjects
general 2021-05-03 10:31:24 at any grade
general 2021-05-03 10:31:35 thats sad
general 2021-05-03 10:32:11 what i dont understand about german is why do they use descriptors and put it all into one longass word
general 2021-05-03 10:32:24 instead of seperating descriptors and the noun
general 2021-05-03 10:32:46 def
general 2021-05-03 10:32:49 thats a fact
general 2021-05-03 10:33:08 oh god
general 2021-05-03 10:34:05 indonesia*

general 2021-05-03 10:35:57 nothing happened
general 2021-05-03 10:36:04 honestly depends on the school
general 2021-05-03 10:36:11 cant say 1 is better than the other
general 2021-05-03 10:36:21 lots of different factors involved
general 2021-05-03 10:36:32 stuff like the staff, subjects, funding, location etc.

help 2021-05-05 11:13:39 40 x 0.3 is 12, that means you should build it 12 blocks in high

general 2021-05-09 10:38:43 are you sure you dont have a virus

general 2021-05-09 10:40:24 send a screenshot
general 2021-05-09 10:40:42 might be your graphics settings in nvidia control panel
general 2021-05-09 10:40:51 im not an expert on those sorts of things so you're gonna have to consult google
general 2021-05-09 10:44:16 try setting your nvidia settings to default

plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:12:34 
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:12:35 why is the cupola so square
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:12:58 wheels also have too much depth
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:13:07 sprocket design is nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:13:52 definitely seen worse
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:13:55 but thats a 6/10
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:15:01 add gradient
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:15:18 small subtle differences in paint around the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:15:22 instead of same base gray paint
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:15:37 how do i explain this
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:16:05 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:16:23 i'd suggest a more dirtier colour around the bottom of the tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:16:28 emulates dirt
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:17:51 see these too
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:17:54 use trails
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:18:20 yea motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:18:34 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:18:49 just small hints of grey around the bottom of the tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:19:20 its ok just keep doing what you're doing rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:19:27 but when i said wheel has too much depth i meant this
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:19:28 
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:19:51 makes the thing look more like car tires
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:20:05 i used disconnectors on mine
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:20:14 stuck it on the middle of the wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:25:13 didnt the british agree to help poland
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:25:14 but never did
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:25:30 at least not until later in the war
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:26:04 ok so british said they'd help
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:26:09 then they told french they wouldnt help
general 2021-05-13 11:31:29 no one cares
general 2021-05-13 11:31:52 you dont need to ask for downvotes if its that bad of a build
general 2021-05-13 11:31:55 relax
general 2021-05-13 11:32:14 ntf are a bunch of bots dude
general 2021-05-13 11:32:23 the real bad guys here are the guards
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:45:50 yea dont restrict the colors to different levels of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:45:59 let me show an example
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:46:27 notice the sideskirt
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 11:46:30 then use 1x1 blocks

general 2021-05-14 05:46:52 and what
general 2021-05-14 08:20:17 i once killed a shredder user by blacklist
general 2021-05-14 08:20:18 ez
general 2021-05-14 08:20:46 bait shredder onto your plot
general 2021-05-14 08:20:48 then blacklist
general 2021-05-14 08:21:19 shredders cant bypass
general 2021-05-14 08:21:29 yea
general 2021-05-14 08:21:35 your cannon isnt a shredder
general 2021-05-14 08:21:58 cutters wont register
general 2021-05-14 08:22:01 they just bounce off
general 2021-05-14 08:22:30 trust me i've tried a shredder cannon
general 2021-05-14 08:22:33 hit detection is poopoo
general 2021-05-14 08:23:25 imagine explosive cylinders
general 2021-05-14 08:23:47 skill issue
general 2021-05-14 08:24:18 yea some degree of automation would be cool in this game
general 2021-05-14 08:24:30 like a speedometer, if you pass a certain speed limit it automatically presses a button
general 2021-05-14 08:24:41 for example you can hook it up to a motor
general 2021-05-14 08:25:00 how would it work though
general 2021-05-14 08:25:15 but dude thing is
general 2021-05-14 08:25:20 you can see vehicles from far away
general 2021-05-14 08:25:23 really easily
general 2021-05-14 08:25:33 not much practical use so i dont think rickje would make it
general 2021-05-14 08:27:45 what if rickje just buffed rockets
general 2021-05-14 08:27:54 increase rocket speed or something
general 2021-05-14 08:27:59 but increase reload time too
general 2021-05-14 08:28:19 yea
general 2021-05-14 08:28:28 rockets spin around creations 3 times then fly into the ground and dont even damage it
general 2021-05-14 08:29:27 cant wait to see planes dropping motors to act as flares
general 2021-05-14 08:29:59 or an actual flare item
general 2021-05-14 08:30:15 like fireworks except no damage and has gravity
general 2021-05-14 08:30:48 then make anti infrared missile missile
general 2021-05-14 08:31:14 its a joke but yea
general 2021-05-14 08:31:16 stuff like that exists irl
general 2021-05-14 08:31:48 pretty sure some ground vehicles use them as countermeasures against ATGMs
general 2021-05-14 08:32:25 literally cutter + explosive block lol
general 2021-05-14 08:32:52 firework doesnt penetrate though
general 2021-05-14 08:33:00 it just explodes on contact
general 2021-05-14 08:33:20 only when the game lags
general 2021-05-14 08:33:24 not really that reliable
general 2021-05-14 08:33:48 an actual kinetic weapon would be cool
general 2021-05-14 08:34:29 i reckon rickje should make it so if explosive blocks get hit by a rocket or firework
general 2021-05-14 08:34:33 then the explosive block blows up too
general 2021-05-14 08:35:52 guys never tested this but do cutters launched by tnt actually behave like shrapnel?
general 2021-05-14 08:36:05 do they do damage
general 2021-05-14 08:36:24 cos as far as I've seen, high speed cutters just bounce off other builds and dont do anything
general 2021-05-14 08:36:43 hi
general 2021-05-14 08:36:59 yea thats stupid though
general 2021-05-14 08:37:07 not a fair fight
general 2021-05-14 08:37:26 yea if its against shredders though
general 2021-05-14 08:37:27 then go for it
general 2021-05-14 23:02:18 ok

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 00:51:41 what about pot
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 03:05:32 you probably met tons, people dont really explicitly say they use blueprints because its pretty common
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:16:15 stugs were the most produced german tank, ofc they were. also goddamn that paint in your creation is terrible, judging by the rest of its features I don't even know if you can even call it a stug at the point it's at rn.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:21:02 driver vision slit, perhaps a mounted mg, spare tracks (as armour), segmented sideskirts, possibly an antenna, also literally everything that's supposed to be on the back of the stug is missing
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:23:38 the sideskirts is unrealistic too, the angle for the top sides is too steep. look at this compared to the sideskirts
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:26:07 mg is also pretty big for your build. i'd suggest just making a gun shield instead because an mg34 is pretty difficult to correctly make at your scale.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:28:34 if you can, try use trails to imitate the segmentation, heres an example from my stug:
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:30:48 yea you're gonna have to motorlock for this
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:33:06 also you see these things connecting the sideskirts to the hull? you can use trails for that.

creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:40:37 spare wheels, wooden boxes, jerry cans, barrels etc. the stowage compartment design is different for some of the tanks too so pick one you like, in my case I found a stug with one designed entirely out of wood so I went with that.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:44:05 yea make the boxes brown because it's wood. maybe half blocks for some of them too to make them shorter.
heres an example: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504436696021204992/811922705205035018/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:46:17 yea the fence is different for some stugs but it extends further back. idk how you can make that work without motorlock tbh.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:48:20 also i forgot to mention, your stug is missing this bit here. I think it's sort of like an exhaust but it's a good idea to include it in your build.

help 2021-05-18 07:53:11 you think you'll be able to fix the nose somehow?
help 2021-05-18 07:53:51 rn you can either make the entire jet bigger so you can use triangle wedges for the nose. another solution is motorlock.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 08:44:55 also has slight tinges of dirt towards the bottom
creations-chat 2021-05-18 09:10:55 yea i literally have no words on how to improve your build other than to delete it
creations-chat 2021-05-18 09:48:25 i can only give so much feedback, but if your build looks like *that* then consider building something else or starting again completely. don't think you paid much attention to your reference images if you even used any

help 2021-05-28 04:32:30 its so inconsistent as far as i've been using them

bug-reports 2021-05-28 04:33:00 not sure why the glass didnt weld to this side of the sparkler
bug-reports 2021-05-28 04:33:06 actually I dont even know if its supposed to weld to the sides at all
bug-reports 2021-05-28 04:34:45 this is what im using to test the welds
bug-reports 2021-05-28 04:39:52 after further testing it appears only the block on the right side would not weld

bug-reports 2021-05-28 04:46:37 this is an image of <@!582834773773254656> doing a similar experiment, it appears this is an actual bug
bug-reports 2021-05-28 05:33:24 my sparklers are rotated away from where they originally positioned when i reload my build, this could be somehow related to the sparklers having inconsistent welds

general 2021-05-28 10:49:39 did you crash
general 2021-05-28 10:49:49 did vip1 crash for you guys
general 2021-05-28 10:50:56 lava pit is more effective than any lag machine
general 2021-05-28 10:50:58 i ahve ever encountered
general 2021-05-28 10:51:02 real
general 2021-05-28 10:53:22 that lava lake test offered some interesting results
general 2021-05-28 10:53:40 when you reset and your build gets destroyed, only everyone in the surrounding area lags
general 2021-05-28 10:53:56 whereas with the lava lake, small portions of your build are destroyed at a time but **everyone** lags
general 2021-05-28 10:56:30 i didnt even know it would lag that hard
general 2021-05-28 10:56:40 i just wanted to jump in the lava pit for fun
general 2021-05-28 10:57:05 tell rickje then
general 2021-05-28 10:57:11 he coded the lava lake
general 2021-05-28 10:59:26 blatardo would you-

general 2021-05-28 11:00:21 no no
general 2021-05-28 11:00:24 im doing rick a favour
general 2021-05-28 11:00:36 im finding out bugs including the fact that the lava lake is heavily unoptimized
general 2021-05-28 11:01:38 maybe just needs to be more optimized
general 2021-05-28 11:01:48 cos even if u reset and position ur camera in the middle of the block pile
general 2021-05-28 11:01:53 it wont lag everyone on the server

general 2021-05-29 02:10:55 have you not played the game in the last 2 years
general 2021-05-29 02:11:19 rick's suggestion is that once rockets begin tracking your creation then you get a popup message

general 2021-05-29 02:52:23 yes
general 2021-05-29 02:52:23 it already does that
general 2021-05-29 02:52:41 rick's suggestion was for a message to be displayed if your build is being tracked by someone elses rocket
general 2021-05-29 02:53:49 press 3
general 2021-05-29 02:53:51 click on ur rocket
general 2021-05-29 02:53:56 check if its set to tracking

bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:52:48 maybe should just weld here
bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:53:28 welding on sides wont make sense because the square base on the bottom is too small to touch a block on the sides
bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:53:40 dont think its supposed to weld on sides anyway
bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:54:32 top isnt
bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:54:32 yea bottom is already weldable
bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:54:46 but it should be because people make barrels for turrets out of them and stuff like that

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:33:09 it still wont stop the missile
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:33:12 it has to land somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:33:31 yea maybe it can stop atgms
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:33:46 but the atgms can still hit you

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:34:45 but at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:34:51 modern emps need to be close enough to electronics
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:35:01 and electronics can be shielded to prevent against being fried by emps
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:35:11 so its pretty much obsolete
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:36:55 yea but emps are obsolete compared to anti missile missiles
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:37:09 thats why theres no need for it
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:37:31 yea
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:37:36 and they'd be more expensive
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:38:01 maybe in the future when emps have more range and are viable
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:38:03 i can see it happening

general 2021-06-08 23:19:21 amongus
general 2021-06-08 23:19:53 what wont work
general 2021-06-08 23:20:06 motorlock it
general 2021-06-08 23:20:09 so it goes down far enough
general 2021-06-08 23:22:14 dont have to
general 2021-06-08 23:22:20 and motorlock doesnt lag
general 2021-06-08 23:22:30 thats a myth made by people that were salty about people knowing how to build better
general 2021-06-08 23:22:50 the thing that lags is moving parts
general 2021-06-08 23:22:54 motorlocks dont move
general 2021-06-08 23:22:59 it lags as much as 1 block
general 2021-06-08 23:23:38 and who are u
general 2021-06-08 23:24:04 so as i was saying
general 2021-06-08 23:24:25 if you're experienced enough with motorlock you can try connect a bunch of details to that one motorlock tower
general 2021-06-08 23:24:48 makes it more efficient meaning you have to deal with less motorlock
general 2021-06-08 23:26:28 this is for interior?
general 2021-06-08 23:26:32 yea\
general 2021-06-08 23:26:51 walls need detail but that too probably needs motorlock lol
general 2021-06-08 23:27:16 do you know the basics
general 2021-06-08 23:27:25 nah bro
general 2021-06-08 23:27:49 once you master the basics motorlock is really ez
general 2021-06-08 23:28:06 you can easily master it in one build project
general 2021-06-08 23:28:41 it looks complicated but it really isnt
general 2021-06-08 23:29:05 watch a couple yt videos and experiment on motorlock for half an hour or less
general 2021-06-08 23:30:25 thats a good question
general 2021-06-08 23:30:39 motorlocking is easy but motorlocking with interior becomes harder
general 2021-06-08 23:31:09 so if you dont want to i dont blame you

It has various equivalents in other languages of Europe.

general 2021-06-17 04:14:43 woman in vc
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:17:04 advanced motorlock is angle locking
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:17:06 camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:17:07 piston locks
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:17:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:17:37 springroll
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:18:12 theres a pattern with it breaking
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:18:19 use it enough and u'll recognise what causes it to break
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:18:41 mine sucks
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:18:46 have to reload the build half the time
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:18:49 even with letting it set
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:19:14 also my piston lock crashes my game if it fails severely
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:20:34 camera lock would be better if it actually saved
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:22:28 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:22:34 nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:22:41 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:22:58 they save sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:03 just depends on how they are arranged
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:04 its weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:40 yea
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:45 then u have to reapply them
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:52 also sparklers have inconsistent welding
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:23:56 its an issue i brought up with rickje
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:24:03 think hes gonna fix it in the softcode
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:24:08 yes they do
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:24:41 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:25:05 either those 4 blocks should all weld
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:25:06 or not weld
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:26:35 i reckon rickje should make 0.5x0.5 cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:26:43 since those are basically sparklers rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:27:09 either that or increase sparkler count to 30 or 40
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:28:45 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:28:46 we know
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:28:48 rickje knows
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:29:38 probs gonna be fixed in the next big update
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:29:46 which is coming in 20 years
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:29:58 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:30:08 rickje said hes working on something but doesnt want to tell us yet

creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:24:24 its too shit to be a copy. that wheel design is widely used in tank creations and ofc the turret will look similar its an mbt.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:26:37 maybe he drew inspiration but some parts of the tank are too drastically different. observe them side by side.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:29:51 still dont think he planned on fully copying, maybe heavily inspired but come on.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:45:07 <@!723940197456281640> you see how the top part of your KT turret comes to a sharp point? dont do that. the top most part is actually flat like in this blueprint here (highlighted in red).
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:49:18 also, if you look at a king tiger from the top it looks a bit like a deformed hexagon. your one is an octagon. you should try to fix that too. next step would be smoothing it out but im pretty sure it would require some motorlock.

general 2021-06-19 13:37:49 having a midpoint is almost always better but if you dont want to rebuild it just motorlock it so you artificially place it on the mid

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:15:05 50 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:15:21 send a pic
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:15:32 you have to be ultraspecific with these things
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:18:55 lift issue but you want help with motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:18:56 ??
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:21:28 just send a pic
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:22:58 ok thats a better explanation
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:23:20 so the reason you're not using an actual rotor is because your entire heli will spin right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:24:32 i dont build helis but to my knowledge theres a way to avoid the heli rotor spinning the entire helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:00 set motor to unpowered and use rockets/hovers or whatever to spin the rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:44 are you using propellor parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:47 for your rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:02 what are ur rotors made of
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:11 are your wing panels on an angle
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:19 ok

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:11:26 just enforce a zero reproduction law for furries
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:11:34 that way we can breed out the disorder
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:12:53 yes which is why we need preventatives for stopping the disorder from re-entering society

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:23:07 a lot have gone too far though
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:23:47 heard that a portion of the lgbt community started discriminating against regular gay people now because they aren't as much of a "minority" as they are
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:24:00 yea its insane
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:24:16 its just a race to see who can be more different than everyone else
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:24:49 exactly man
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:25:22 its not even based or redpilled

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:30:18 maybe if you lived in some 3rd world country
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:30:24 but i doubt bubbington is in a 3rd world country

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:01 include this thing on the tip
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:05 motorlock a trail
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:31 also general shape is difficult to get with vanilla plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:37 you need motorlock to do it accurately
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:52 try using rotate lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:37:54 to build nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:38:39 yea same solution
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:38:40 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:08 so is your issue the wheels are welded together
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:09 and wont move
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:19 or they are unwelded but making contact
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:22 so the friction is stopping the motor
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:38 you have the wheels unwelded in build mode then have a motorlock tower to retract the wheels into the correct position
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:39:44 that way it's going to be unwelded
general 2021-06-21 06:40:38 wait

creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:24:54 i think he can build well its just that he doesn't put the effort in
general 2021-06-21 13:26:44 https://www.roblox.com/games/3837841034/0-18-3-Deadline?refPageId=d6e01b02-1772-45ec-9c61-198d4de50fbc
general 2021-06-21 13:26:48 better
general 2021-06-21 13:27:11 gameplaywise its very different
general 2021-06-21 13:27:26 even though they have the same concept of running around shooting people
general 2021-06-21 13:27:39 yes
general 2021-06-21 13:27:40 thats why its better
general 2021-06-21 13:27:56 for what
general 2021-06-21 13:28:14 i dont even bother with attachments lol
general 2021-06-21 13:28:54 lacked updates
general 2021-06-21 13:29:00 and it had balancing issues for a long time
general 2021-06-21 13:29:13 archers used to be op
general 2021-06-21 13:29:15 infinite arrows
general 2021-06-21 13:29:27 for what
general 2021-06-21 13:29:34 you cant
general 2021-06-21 13:29:41 what
general 2021-06-21 13:30:23 do you even have a proper gpu
general 2021-06-21 13:30:29 are you using integrated graphics
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:31:26 problem with his tutorial style is that they just aren't that good to look at imo, seems like the same stuff you see in <#384025409945337856> everyday. some tutorials are straight up inaccurate to the actual vehicle irl
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 13:33:55 is thrust vectoring really that special
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 13:34:12 i see whitenames treat it like a scientific breakthrough in <#384025409945337856> occassionally
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 13:34:20 yea
general 2021-06-21 13:34:43 oh
general 2021-06-21 13:34:46 yea
general 2021-06-21 13:34:48 930m is so bad now
general 2021-06-21 13:34:51 cant even consider it a gpu
general 2021-06-21 13:34:58 i had a similar gpu in my laptop
general 2021-06-21 13:36:18 what can we consider average
general 2021-06-21 13:36:19 1660?
general 2021-06-21 13:36:30 and that is like 800-1000% better than 930m
general 2021-06-21 13:37:11 let me check
general 2021-06-21 13:37:35 
general 2021-06-21 13:37:44 this is steam gpu list
general 2021-06-21 13:37:51 percentage of players with whatever gpu
general 2021-06-21 13:38:40 average score is 550-650% better
general 2021-06-21 13:38:43 than his laptop gpu
general 2021-06-21 13:38:46 it is
general 2021-06-21 13:38:51 once this gpu shortage is over
general 2021-06-21 13:39:08 i suggest getting a proper desktop
general 2021-06-21 13:39:15 still wouldnt buy
general 2021-06-21 13:39:25 prices still trash compared to norm
general 2021-06-21 13:39:47 yea hopefully its over next year
general 2021-06-21 13:39:51 otherwise 🤷‍♂️
general 2021-06-21 13:40:19 yea it has no chance
general 2021-06-21 13:40:21 rdr2 30fps
general 2021-06-21 13:40:35 my laptop gpu was around the same as your performance
general 2021-06-21 13:40:41 couldnt even run planetside 2 and that game is a decade old now
general 2021-06-21 13:40:54 mind you im talking about lowest settings on PL2
general 2021-06-21 13:41:30 yea
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:43:18 his tanks would get mass downvoted lol
general 2021-06-21 13:43:44 what model is your laptop
general 2021-06-21 13:46:04 6gb ram
general 2021-06-21 13:46:13 man
general 2021-06-21 13:46:23 bare minimum
general 2021-06-21 13:46:33 some games still wont run with 8gb
general 2021-06-21 13:46:58 yea in a couple years from now
general 2021-06-21 13:47:02 most people gonna get 32gb
general 2021-06-21 13:47:28 you need a nasa supercomputer
general 2021-06-21 13:47:32 just to open another tab
general 2021-06-21 13:48:30 why 24gb
general 2021-06-21 13:49:45 i might be wrong here
general 2021-06-21 13:49:55 but isnt 32gb cheaper
general 2021-06-21 13:50:00 16x2
general 2021-06-21 13:50:09 than 16+8gb
general 2021-06-21 13:50:21 why you showing us
general 2021-06-21 13:51:32 yea
general 2021-06-21 13:51:42 what manufacturer is your ram from?
general 2021-06-21 13:52:05 can never go wrong with corsair
general 2021-06-21 13:52:38 no
general 2021-06-21 13:52:48 firstly lots of bloatware
general 2021-06-21 13:52:55 secondly their desktops are shit so i wouldnt trust them with laptops
general 2021-06-21 13:53:04 and from personal experience
general 2021-06-21 13:53:08 their laptops underperform
general 2021-06-21 13:53:14 idk if its from quality assurance issues or what
general 2021-06-21 13:53:37 i mean
general 2021-06-21 13:53:39 dell used to be good
general 2021-06-21 13:54:19 thanks
general 2021-06-21 13:54:53 lol
general 2021-06-21 13:54:59 mine used to reach 90 degrees
general 2021-06-21 13:55:32 depends on the game
general 2021-06-21 13:55:36 in general its garbage though
general 2021-06-21 13:55:46 100+ ping is already considered unfavourable
general 2021-06-21 13:56:00 ping has nothing to do with processing power
general 2021-06-21 13:56:02 its internet
general 2021-06-21 13:56:07 and where you live relative to roblox servers
general 2021-06-21 13:56:22 they have a couple around the world
general 2021-06-21 13:56:26 some scattered around US
general 2021-06-21 13:56:33 i know theres some servers in singapore
general 2021-06-21 13:56:46 maybe some in south america
general 2021-06-21 13:56:48 if im not wrong
general 2021-06-21 13:57:41 <@!725185242973077545>
general 2021-06-21 13:58:43 get your laptop cleaned
general 2021-06-21 13:58:59 if you are brave enough
general 2021-06-21 13:59:01 do it yourself
general 2021-06-21 13:59:32 yea
general 2021-06-21 13:59:34 dont overclock
general 2021-06-21 13:59:47 the hotter your pc gets the more it slows down
general 2021-06-21 13:59:53 because its trying to avoid overheating
general 2021-06-21 14:00:02 so by overclocking you are actually making ur pc slower
general 2021-06-21 14:00:27 same but 75c is still fine
general 2021-06-21 14:00:43 maybe 85c
general 2021-06-21 14:00:44 to 90
general 2021-06-21 14:00:52 idk
general 2021-06-21 14:00:58 might be different depending on ur pc
general 2021-06-21 14:01:58 negligable damage
general 2021-06-21 14:02:03 might shave off lifespan by 10%
general 2021-06-21 14:02:14 but electronics are designed to withstand temps like that consistently
general 2021-06-21 14:02:59 same

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:21:56 lol fix the scaling of some parts, do you really need me to fully annotate a pic of your gustav when you clearly need glasses to see the differences between your build and an actual schwerer gustav. to name a couple issues, back is too tall, barrel is too short and front slope angle is off

general 2021-06-25 03:12:18 thats why mad gave up
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:13:01 easy fix bro
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:23:18 sides of the hull are flat
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:23:27 curve it out, like an actual ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:24:35 ^
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:24:37 what ship is that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:27:32 so notice how the sides are curved
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:27:42 either use angled motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:27:43 or 1x4s/1x3s
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:27:52 a bit too much curve is better than no curve at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:35:38 underside is curved upwards
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:36:05 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:36:08 👍
creations-chat 2021-06-25 04:11:54 snips actually has less quality than normal screenshot, i'd recommend just zooming in as much as possible, screenshot then crop
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:18 "to reduce lag"
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:24 i dont know who came up with that bullshit
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:26 but from my prior dev experience
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:28 i know its fake
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:56 motorlock lag is negligible
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:03 you know what lags more than motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:07 moving parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:16 motorlock lags as much as any other block
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:23 unless your pc looks like a literal potato
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:42 still
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:46 motorlock lags the same
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:43:00 you wont experience any significant difference
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:43:03 unless you are using 1000 motors
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:43:16 im not kidding

general 2021-06-29 07:13:17 lo
general 2021-06-29 07:13:25 LMA
general 2021-06-29 07:13:39 so you CAN verify even if you have an <13 roblox account
general 2021-06-29 07:13:48 mods have always insisted that the verification system is infallible
general 2021-06-29 07:13:55 so even if that have <13 accounts they cant join the server
general 2021-06-29 07:14:02 yousuf
general 2021-06-29 07:14:05 you need to tell the other mods
general 2021-06-29 07:14:33 they put too much trust in the verification system though
general 2021-06-29 07:14:46 everytime theres a guy with a <13 roblox account they're like "oh well i guess they've already been manually verified"
general 2021-06-29 07:15:34 and this incident proved them wrong
general 2021-06-29 07:15:42 tl;dr mods poopybrain
general 2021-06-29 07:15:45 need better unde check
general 2021-06-29 07:16:35 altforever had a <13 account
general 2021-06-29 07:16:40 and he still had access to the server
general 2021-06-29 07:16:55 so even <13 accounts can still bypass the verification bot
general 2021-06-29 07:17:27 but that would require him getting unde checked
general 2021-06-29 07:17:34 because thats what happens everytime they get manually verified
general 2021-06-29 07:18:20 the day pcc dies
general 2021-06-29 07:18:40 wouldnt it still be worth verifying

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 11:59:42 like what, only 12 states?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:00:06 forse is the correct spelling
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:00:36 its the official spelling for the USA, force is just a regional dialect

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:02:51 it is
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 12:03:00 it just depends on where you live

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:18:07 oh those swashplates
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:18:10 no im bad with helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:04:41 range of judgement of the chad?
general 2021-07-06 03:06:32 that is 100% factual
general 2021-07-06 03:07:28 you know how theres wedges for 1x1 all the way to 1x4
general 2021-07-06 03:07:45 it limits your options for angles on your build
general 2021-07-06 03:07:50 custom angling is done by motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:07:53 which allows for any wedge
general 2021-07-06 03:08:19 LO
general 2021-07-06 03:08:22 incorrect
general 2021-07-06 03:08:43 i cant tell you the amount of builds with motorlocks that look utter shit
general 2021-07-06 03:08:57 yet theres several builds without motorlock in <#627195143040139264>
general 2021-07-06 03:09:01 ask rbk about his builds in hof
general 2021-07-06 03:09:30 ^ this
general 2021-07-06 03:10:17 so do you have any statistical data on your 80%?

general 2021-07-06 03:13:02 
general 2021-07-06 03:13:09 he said that builds with motorlock get upvotes most of the time
general 2021-07-06 03:13:30 yet these are literally the only builds with motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:13:34 for the past few creations
general 2021-07-06 03:13:57 now <@!738086786970026035>  i dont really like this KT tbh
general 2021-07-06 03:14:00 your hull mg is broken
general 2021-07-06 03:14:02 fix it pls
general 2021-07-06 03:14:08 plus mounted MG is too huge for the tank
general 2021-07-06 03:14:10 motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:14:23 good
general 2021-07-06 03:15:03 oh i found a build from earlier today
general 2021-07-06 03:15:12 does this look like it has motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:15:46 ah yea
general 2021-07-06 03:16:06 this also proves another point
general 2021-07-06 03:16:09 that expert  designer super ez
general 2021-07-06 03:16:25 so is yomo
general 2021-07-06 03:16:53 exactly
general 2021-07-06 03:16:59 ez
general 2021-07-06 03:16:59 meme build = upvotes
general 2021-07-06 03:17:05 yea he did
general 2021-07-06 03:17:15 either that or camera lock
general 2021-07-06 03:17:20 but camera lock pretty poo so i doubt it
general 2021-07-06 03:18:02 yet another example of unnecessary shitty motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:18:22 just  dont put a mounted mg then
general 2021-07-06 03:18:56 same
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:21:34 why is the main body so skinny
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:21:41 it looks like a skewer with wings attached
general 2021-07-06 03:27:44 but the fact is
general 2021-07-06 03:28:17 motorlock alone cant decide on whos build is good or not
general 2021-07-06 03:28:27 its a skillset that has to be learnt and used properly
general 2021-07-06 03:29:29 fardtankplane
general 2021-07-06 03:30:15 is that a normal tiger 2
general 2021-07-06 03:30:18 just with the turret moved forward
general 2021-07-06 03:31:41 yes 80% is most of the time
general 2021-07-06 03:31:53 we are talking about builds with motorlocks
general 2021-07-06 03:32:22 only a small portion of the playerbase actually understand motorlock
general 2021-07-06 03:32:27 making the results heavily skewed
general 2021-07-06 03:32:47 if we talk about **only** motorlock you will find that motorlock alone isnt what makes a build good
general 2021-07-06 03:33:52 motorlock is only as good as the person who uses it
general 2021-07-06 03:34:25 moderlok
general 2021-07-06 03:34:29 😱
general 2021-07-06 03:38:05 why are you even overclocking a 930m
general 2021-07-06 03:38:18 not worth tbh
general 2021-07-06 03:38:24 result is gonna be so miniscule it wont matter
general 2021-07-06 03:38:50 bruh
general 2021-07-06 03:39:01 you wont have to undervolt if u dont overclock it in the first place
general 2021-07-06 03:39:34 <@!855062502814777352> same
general 2021-07-06 03:39:55 i dont think u will
general 2021-07-06 03:40:02 undervolting is just for cooling down your cpu/gpu
general 2021-07-06 03:40:16 at least thats my current understanding of it
general 2021-07-06 03:41:16 aight

plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:13:55 what are your thoughts on communism
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:00 starvation
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:01 genocide
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:06 oppression
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:10 dictatorships
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:37 if the ideology consistently yields bad results across varying nations
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:15:40 perhaps the ideology is flawed
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:16:12 lo
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 10:16:28 perhaps he just likes red army

the-dump 2021-07-12 01:18:10 oh your back
general 2021-07-12 01:19:06 its not that its scary
general 2021-07-12 01:19:15 the fact that its earrape is annoying
general 2021-07-12 01:19:31 i have seen people getting warned for earrape so its not too farfetched
general 2021-07-12 01:19:52 those videos only exist to piss people off
general 2021-07-12 01:20:01 it contributes nothing
general 2021-07-12 01:20:23 you can easily argue it violates the common sense rule
general 2021-07-12 01:21:34 gullible or not
general 2021-07-12 01:21:46 if you check memes out often you will still experience earrape
general 2021-07-12 01:22:15 but a lower rate than others if you are wary of those types of troll videos
general 2021-07-12 01:23:30 anyway thats enough of my rant
general 2021-07-12 01:23:34 some mods will warn for earrape and some wont, i just want uniformity on if they will allow these or not
general 2021-07-12 01:50:14 lo

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 04:53:42 but no game seriously uses rthro
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 04:54:16 probably some overcomplicated gear mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 04:54:55 r6 and r15 depends on game

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 04:58:12 
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 04:58:16 two side rockets

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:06:22 they arent
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:06:25 they are bigass targets
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:06:34 easily outmanoeuvred
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:06:44 most weapon emplacements on the airship are easily disabled
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:06:59 which is the case for majority of airships
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:07:26 ground vehicles can still outmanoeuvre
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:06 and as soon as someone in a pvp server sees a huge build
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:09 its basically saying
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:15 "SHOOT ME"
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:36 just because a server has all ground vehicles doesnt mean the same players dont have air vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:40 they can easily switch
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:08:50 plus stationary turrets can easily destroy airships
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:09:00 shredder bugs exist too

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:21:46 what you are displaying is an outlier
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:21:51 it's extremely selective
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:22:03 you cannot deny that a lot of the time downvotes are justified
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:22:19 i dont
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:23:01 yea thats pretty shit ngl
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:24:24 yea you don't say "add points" to that

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:30:02 peace is not an option
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:30:46 anime is good
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:30:47 weeb no
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:31:06 its like the fnaf fanbase
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:31:10 fnaf good game? yes

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:31:33 90% of furries are weird as fuck ngl
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:31:58 they are a special case
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:32:54 the people on this server do it because most of the time its more of an "in your face" situation
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:33:00 with weirdass pfps
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:33:43 my pfp does not spark conflict
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:33:48 and people joke about it
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:33:56 you cannot have that with furries or anime pfps
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:34:19 furries and weebs already have a stereotype of being annoying
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:34:27 flaunting it in other people's face makes it worse
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:35:02 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 09:35:37 or the people that put lgbt flags on every single creation they build, on their pfp and talk about how the next president should be a gay man

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 04:58:52 it isnt wrong to say he is german
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 04:59:20 likewise black people can be americans, they are just of african heritage. it'd be really stupid to say they arent american

general 2021-10-03 06:24:25 ice has the most friction
general 2021-10-03 06:24:28 I use it on all my wheels
general 2021-10-03 06:24:30 very cool
general 2021-10-03 06:24:44 factual
general 2021-10-03 06:25:05 ok
general 2021-10-03 06:25:20 ok
general 2021-10-03 06:25:39 what made you watch fury
general 2021-10-03 06:28:17 yeah its about as accurate as girls und panzer
general 2021-10-03 06:30:44 the americans only faced tigers 3-4 times in normandy
general 2021-10-03 06:31:00 so fury is already incorrect
general 2021-10-03 06:32:44 actually
general 2021-10-03 06:32:51 im wrong it takes place across germany
general 2021-10-03 06:33:26 clash of clans
general 2021-10-03 06:33:56 because plot armor
general 2021-10-03 06:34:00 irl the tiger wouldve shot fury first
general 2021-10-03 06:34:02 since it had the 76mm gun
general 2021-10-03 06:34:25 plot
general 2021-10-03 06:34:40 either that or the tank commander was overdosing
general 2021-10-03 06:35:38 tanks get mislabelled a lot
general 2021-10-03 06:36:04 a lot of US tank crews thought they fought tigers when instead they were panzer ivs and stug iiis
general 2021-10-03 06:36:48 and as with all wars friendly fire was an issue due to misidentification and breakdown of communication
general 2021-10-03 06:37:03 so its understandable that the guy thought it was on their side
general 2021-10-03 06:37:11 but hes still a bit dumb
general 2021-10-03 06:37:51 what tank was he up against
general 2021-10-03 06:38:30 ok he's dumb then
general 2021-10-03 06:38:58 panther exposing side armor
general 2021-10-03 06:38:59 brilliant
general 2021-10-03 06:39:07 panther commander hasnt played war thunder smh
general 2021-10-03 06:40:03 lmaaao
general 2021-10-03 06:40:58 what happened to the crew
general 2021-10-03 06:41:07 did they survive or get obliterated
general 2021-10-03 06:41:20 what about after
general 2021-10-03 06:41:27 is there records on what happened to them
general 2021-10-03 06:42:16 decent kdr
general 2021-10-03 06:44:22 found some info
general 2021-10-03 06:44:39 apparently the crew surrendered and the commander lived to the age of 93

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:54:02 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:55:19 why is it shaped like that
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:56:28 
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:56:30 use trail
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:56:42 ok good
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:57:00 what about just using a regular sphere with trail
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:57:07 then motorlocking it so it merges with the hull
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:57:15 or pistonlock if motorlock not good enough
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:58:56 nothing
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:59:01 just ignore it
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:59:18 cant do much
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:59:59 or
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:00:13 make a SAM that fires pps at his plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:00:16 shoot it down
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:01:23 just use default ball
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:01:51 i meant half ball
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:01:53 but yea
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:02:29 u can angle the half ball to match the angle of the wedge
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:13:54 better
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:14:00 but too far up
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:24:05 <@!559568621312147476> why not just do this
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:24:07 then motorlock in barrel
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:24:34 angle halfball
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:25:33 make space
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:28:16 nice camo
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:29:18 only thing is that the yellow is a bit too saturated
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:29:26 so it stands out more than it should
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:29:41 yea
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:30:57 tbh its a bit more dull in the photo except for this part here
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:30:59 
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:31:06 probably because of the reflection of the light on the metal
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:31:56 not a big difference
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:32:04 but its up to u
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 09:59:05 wow

pretty sure the kamikaze pilots were all volunteers. in japanese culture sacrificing your life for the land of the rising sun and the emperor was seen as honorable
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:37:10 "Yeah thats correct for the most part." is all you needed to type out lol. I wasn't discussing the nuking of hiroshima and nagasaki
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:40:05 that has nothing to do with the government forcing pilots to die in battle. they still gave them a choice. If you don't raise your hand you signify that you are ready to die, period.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:42:18 kamikaze pilots are **supposed** to die. if you fail to complete that mission 9 times, especially after you volunteered, then obviously you'll be seen as a lying traitor

general 2021-12-09 09:48:02 i like how your bio links to an nsfw site
general 2021-12-09 09:48:38 makes you seem gay, especially seeing the gumball nsfw
general 2021-12-09 09:50:39 didnt neanderthals have bigger brains
general 2021-12-09 09:50:44 except they had the intelligence of people that build shredder bugs
general 2021-12-09 09:51:14 in a way
general 2021-12-09 09:51:18 they did
general 2021-12-09 09:51:47 almost all humans today have some level of neanderthal dna
general 2021-12-09 09:52:35 depends on how much content
general 2021-12-09 09:52:45 im sure they can grasp some basic concepts
general 2021-12-09 09:55:01 lock motor
general 2021-12-09 09:55:02 ez
general 2021-12-09 09:56:05 yeah but you still motorlocked
general 2021-12-09 09:56:11 instead of engines
general 2021-12-09 09:56:16 you use blocks
general 2021-12-09 09:56:38 motorlocking is really ez once you do one build with it
general 2021-12-09 09:57:37 looks more complicated than it is
general 2021-12-09 09:57:57 my first motorlocked build had a single central motorlock tower
general 2021-12-09 09:58:04 that was enough to get me the expert designer role
general 2021-12-09 09:58:42 so once you create that first tower, its smooth sailing from there
general 2021-12-09 11:37:10 it means hes admin
creations-chat 2021-12-09 11:38:05 too blocky
general 2021-12-09 11:38:46 if thats for the battlebot tournament u gonna lose
general 2021-12-09 11:39:30 if a cutter manages to slip into here then you lose half your weapons
general 2021-12-09 11:40:23 ok
general 2021-12-09 11:40:26 my suggestion is to make it thicker
general 2021-12-09 11:46:05 🤮
general 2021-12-09 11:47:45 you fool
general 2021-12-09 11:47:55 we **are** homophobia
general 2021-12-09 11:48:28 lgtv
general 2021-12-09 11:48:32 📺 😎
general 2021-12-09 11:49:01 why is it even called a phobia
general 2021-12-09 11:49:06 why would anyone be scared of a gay
general 2021-12-09 11:50:05 there are only 2 genders
general 2021-12-09 11:50:40 then throw them off a building right
general 2021-12-09 11:53:40 being anything other than straight is a mental disorder
general 2021-12-09 11:53:59 we as a species are genetically encouraged to have a spouse of the opposite gender
general 2021-12-09 11:54:47 deviations from the mindset of which that allowed humanity to reproduce for the past tens of thousands of years are unnatural
general 2021-12-09 11:55:12 we are literally supposed to be attracted to the opposite gender through genetics
general 2021-12-09 11:55:18 so being gay isnt normal
general 2021-12-09 11:56:33 dont exist
general 2021-12-09 11:56:36 mods confirmed
general 2021-12-09 11:59:31 we dont need huge building bases
general 2021-12-09 11:59:37 just fix motor 2s and pistons then i'll be happy
general 2021-12-09 12:00:03 yes
general 2021-12-09 12:00:34 its gonna be 20 plaeyrs
general 2021-12-09 12:00:36 actually
general 2021-12-09 12:01:06 yea definitely not
general 2021-12-09 12:01:12 just imagine 100 players all with a thousand block builds
general 2021-12-09 12:03:48 its not a matter of how
general 2021-12-09 12:03:49 but when

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:13 turns into roblox studio
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:26 piston locking
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:30 if you really want to do that
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:01:25 same
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:01:31 piston locking pretty useful when it doesnt break
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:01:39 and its gonna be more reliable in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:02:06 why
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:03:43 he keeps switching topic lo
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:04:14 yea but in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:04:19 its gonna be way better
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:05:17 yeah because refusing to use it in pc2 will mean you have a major skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:07:01 pay robux for access to explosive block <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:12:15 so piston lock still necessary for some things
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:13:14 that reminds me
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:13:20 i wonder if there will be any physics changes in PC2

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 10:03:30 plane crazy 2
general 2021-12-15 10:06:11 design vehicles to fight a shredder bug army
general 2021-12-15 10:07:49 seriously though
general 2021-12-15 10:07:58 if there is a singleplayer, it should just be like the besiege campaign
general 2021-12-15 10:08:11 since besiege is basically plane crazy 3
general 2021-12-15 10:09:56 they should
general 2021-12-15 10:10:01 like in besiege you can choose your approach
general 2021-12-15 10:10:06 for completing objectives
general 2021-12-15 10:11:02 plane crazy was never just about planes
general 2021-12-15 10:11:58 all pvp weapons need a rework
general 2021-12-15 10:12:02 absolute garbage rn
general 2021-12-15 10:14:04 its like pvp weapons were a last minute addition to the game
general 2021-12-15 10:14:26 they are so bad to use its not even funny
general 2021-12-15 10:15:04 there needs to be a minimum size for rockets
general 2021-12-15 10:15:10 otherwise it just becomes too easy to cram them in
general 2021-12-15 10:15:30 so what
general 2021-12-15 10:15:32 at least it takes effort
general 2021-12-15 10:15:39 and still takes up space on the build plot
general 2021-12-15 10:21:15 tilt head and jump
general 2021-12-15 10:22:44 open door
general 2021-12-15 10:22:46 jump
general 2021-12-15 10:25:46 just turn your entire vehicle to aim <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-15 10:28:35 takes hours and hundreds of blocks to build a working turret in this game
general 2021-12-15 10:29:01 you need like 150 locked motors
general 2021-12-15 10:29:06 cap
general 2021-12-15 10:29:47 not even for details
general 2021-12-15 10:29:49 just to have it work
general 2021-12-15 10:30:40 
general 2021-12-15 10:30:44 you need to make each individual gear tooth
general 2021-12-15 10:30:46 out of motors

creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:28:08 ok? so you want us to upvote every single build now? whats the point in having a voting system then
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:30:12 how about explicitly asking people what’s wrong with your build instead of whinging about getting downvoted
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:34:13 “Yea people just downvote anything if its slightly imperfect”

well, you did try to convince yourself that most people downvote for no reason, which is objectively false.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:37:25 eh, that just means the build needs to be redone. idk why a lot of people cant be bothered using <#478584971670454284> and <#504436696021204992> for support throughout their build, then when they get downvoted we hear “but but there was nothing wrong with my build! 😢 “
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:43:35 if people display subpar creations to the public, they deserve all the ridicule they get. it doesnt take a lot of comparison and investigation to realise that your creation is lacking, and if they keep insisting to themselves that their build is the Mona Lisa I hope they get downvoted into oblivion
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:48:39 you have every chance to ask yourself: Is my build to scale? Did I paint this well? Are parts in the right spot? What else could I add? Could I ask for someone elses opinion?

people often reject going through this process, and it is not a surprise they get downvoted. now when you fail to do multiple of these things, all you have accomplished is the very thing we call a shitty build.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:51:54 <#384025409945337856> is a place where people rate the builds of others, nobody is obliged to give feedback. If you want criticism that badly go to <#478584971670454284> / <#384021699466756107> 
asking for someone’s opinion is the easiest thing, its not rocket science
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:54:01 hmm, I wonder, you could probably post your build here and ask one of us then? theres several expert designers here, ask while you have the chance
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:58:25 go straight back to what? theres always people in this server providing help. heck when I first started I got assistance from 3 different people, and my build was a pile of steaming garbage
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:00:50 you literally have a chance for feedback right now, yet you don’t want it? make up your mind pls

I’d also mention that getting feedback is much easier than you have convinced yourself otherwise, im offering a chance to you rn but idk what you want
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:06:46 thats because they post in <#384025409945337856> with a knowingly poor build. they expect criticism AFTER they have put the creation on a pedestal for the server to see, or sometimes they dont even realise what garbage they just built. you realise that  people dont want to endlessly scroll to see a decent build correct? so what right does the builder have to start sulking when other players express their disgust? what I do not understand is people not asking for feedback BEFORE posting in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:09:32 if it doesn’t look bad, it gets upvoted. I don’t see the issue?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:12:33 that is the biggest pile of bullshit i have ever seen in ages. someone offer a counter argument, im done wasting my time. off to sleep, toodaloo.

creations-chat 2021-12-18 02:38:16 you need to find the width to length ratio, then apply that ingame. if you use this simple math you won't have trouble with scaling correctly

help 2021-12-26 09:09:58 honorable
general 2021-12-26 09:11:55 sugestiv
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:12:56 i always feel like momentum is an illusion in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:13:24 even in 0 grav, you’d expect an object to move in a certain direction forever. it doesnt do that ingame
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:13:49 theres inertia despite no gravity
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:15:46 yeah but
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:15:54 its very artificial
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:16:10 obviously not how it’d work in the real world
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:16:33 from wings
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:17:04 wings create artificial resistance
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:17:09 not sure about anything else
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:18:22 even more buggy than pistons
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:21:41 piston locks have reliability issues
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:21:55 occasionally they fail to lock properly and spazz out
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:22:05 literally just lock piston
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:22:23 and wait a few seconds before activating the motorlocks in your build
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:23:49 its like custom angling
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:24:20 except with piston lock you do it to move a block over minuscule distances

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:27:18 doesn't have to be exposed
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:27:39 you have the motorlocks in the rear of the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:27:49 then connect them to the triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:27:59 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:28:08 actually
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:28:14 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:29:27 
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:29:39 connect it with text or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:31:20 or literally hide the motorlock in this outlined section
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:31:31 you can merge the motorlock block with the barrel wall
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:32:13 yeah you can have the motorlocks hidden behind the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:32:23 that is harder than the second option
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:32:25 ok then
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:32:27 do second option
general 2021-12-27 11:33:09 piss language
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:33:30 second option is easiest
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:34:22 dont torture yourself
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:34:55 what
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:35:26 im literally gonna do an example ingame
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:35:29 then show you
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:22:55 add random shit that doesnt exist

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:07 the bridge has these lines
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:10 and dots on the sides
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:15 on the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:19 you can see detail
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:34 
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:49 for this you you can use fake tracks
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:24:59 make a REALLY good looking sprocket
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:25:04 using motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:25:18 
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:25:23 theres also these things between the top and bottom wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:25:34 i think thats suspension for the bottom wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:25:35 but idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:26:14 
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:26:21 the bridge seems to be dirty in this pic
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:26:33 why does a bridge need camoflauge
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 12:26:34 wt

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:23:42 doesnt hcl have a higher acidity
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:24:00 hydrogen peroxide
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:24:07 so it'd make sense to drink that over hcl
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:24:30 i thought it was acid
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:25:38 ya
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 13:26:02 and hydrogen peroxide is used in mouthwash

help 2021-12-30 00:54:46 <@!739369649971527720>
help 2021-12-30 00:59:26 length should be 2.1 times longer than width
help 2021-12-30 00:59:55 currently you have 2,46
help 2021-12-30 01:00:28 13x2.1 means the length should be 27 blocks
help 2021-12-30 01:00:58 either that or you could increase the width
help 2021-12-30 01:01:55 2 blocks
help 2021-12-30 01:03:03 so you want to increase width first, right?
help 2021-12-30 01:04:52 i base it on wheels for length
help 2021-12-30 01:04:56 and then I adjust width accordingly
help 2021-12-30 01:05:19 im not the greatest tank builder, but at least it makes my builds to scale
help 2021-12-30 01:09:31 2.79/7.72 means the height should be 0.36 times as much as the length
help 2021-12-30 01:09:41 
help 2021-12-30 01:10:25 32 blocks multiplied by 0.36 gives us 11.52 for height
help 2021-12-30 01:10:59 these measurements are for the 2A4 variant btw
help 2021-12-30 01:12:01 thats the overall height
help 2021-12-30 01:12:02 so yeah
help 2021-12-30 01:16:07 if you want to switch variants to a later model, like 2a6 or 2a7 you'll have to increase the length

general 2021-12-30 01:27:48 imagine a high spinning motor, you still gonna have the emit particles?
general 2021-12-30 01:28:26 yea but what if you're outside of the vehicle
general 2021-12-30 01:28:54 and how many blocks should emit particles
general 2021-12-30 01:29:05 do you realise the amount of lag from 3000 block creations all generating particles
general 2021-12-30 01:30:12 pc2 is optimized
general 2021-12-30 01:30:16 that is not synonymous for no lag
general 2021-12-30 01:33:18 one of the updates removed it from some people's inventories

general 2021-12-30 06:29:36 pvp mode feels like a last minute decision right as the game was about to be released
general 2021-12-30 06:29:44 no offense to the developers, but combat is so bad
general 2021-12-30 06:30:11 builds going invisible when you shoot them enough

general 2021-12-30 06:32:53 yea and pvp takes no effort at all
general 2021-12-30 06:33:02 you just need 2 motor 2s, spam a couple weapons and you're all set
general 2021-12-30 06:33:35 you can build a tutorial shredder bug
general 2021-12-30 06:33:44 and dominate a server full of people who actually tried to build a good looking creation
general 2021-12-30 06:34:12 there is no drawbacks to maxing out weapons
general 2021-12-30 06:35:11 you can literally have a HOF-tier build in pvp getting absolutely destroyed by a tutorial plane some kid built in 5 minutes

general 2021-12-31 10:44:48 you can have a fast rotating motor with little torque, so the motor will fail to rotate when it collides with an object

<@!393527373729103888> that still doesn't excuse using tutorials, btw it's completely possible to make an original build without copying <:trollface:775024642104229898>



<@!597188078670577668> it's bad when people post them into <#384025409945337856> because you're only supposed to post your own stuff. the issue is plagiarism not using tutorials itself
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:59:26 > It’s only when people discredit and continuously repeat tutorials without progressing building skill that it is a bad thing.
that's the issue here. most people who use tutorials don't give a shit about learning. I fully support tutorials that teach how to build advanced mechanical constructs or the fundamentals (e.g swashplates for helicopters or motorlocking)
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:02:47 that is a cluttered screen
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:04:14 don't see why you would use a tutorial in the first place if you're fully capable of building each section by yourself

then make your own build and don't use somebody else's unique creation as a framework

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:57:46 you're better off angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:58:18 idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:58:20 depends on what you want to do
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:58:58 you can probably do a cylinder cockpit the same as any other angle locked cockpit

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:03 pc1 is free and if he makes pc2 paid access he loses 90% of his playerbase
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:21 its not good for business
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:27 resize tool
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:54 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:01 depends
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:15 there will be times that a resize tool would be better than motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:24 but motorlocking will still have a place
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:34 it will still be a 1x1 grid
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:42 so if you want to merge two blocks together you still need motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:22:54 idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:19 you accidently used camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:32 when you configure cameras you can select a block and it will weld to that block
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:44 it also changes the angle
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:01 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:09 actual no gravity
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:31 no gravity is still not no gravity
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:57 yeah buts theres no gravity
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:03 so theres not supposed to be air resistance
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:36 theres no air resistance if all your thrusters are off
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:50 but if your thrusters are on its still there
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:53 what for
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:19 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:21 pvp needs rework
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:23 pvp rn is garbage
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:32 all you have to do is build shredder bug or a turret with weapon spam to win
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:36 no effort
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:57 no one uses fuel lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:02 wont be surprised if its not in PC2
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:24 if inf fuel was removed though
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:32 it could actually make PVP better
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:44 since shredders cant spam super rockets
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:51 nor jets
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:29:05 or at least
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:29:13 removing inf fuel for PVP
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:29:51 horror for people who build like shit
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:02 hypersonic shredder bugs will be harder to build
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:31:37 or adding ammunition blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:31:56 then you can resupply at spawnpoints
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:16 i think cutters are getting replaced
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:32 I want to see overheating for guns
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:38 and the more guns you have the faster they all overheat
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:45 so it stops people from spamming
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:59 no lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:33:20 plane crazy not phantom forces
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:34:08 eh guns in WFYB were executed alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:34:27 what's the story going to be lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:35:37 vip1
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:35:52 wfyb came first
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:36:08 guns have always been a thing lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:36:12 I played it since it released
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:36:25 its kinda dead because its outdated
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:36:29 it was released in 2014
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:37:02 wtf is warship craft
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:37:34 plane crazy and wfyb are different games with different themes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:37:43 just because it wouldnt work out well in PC2 doesnt mean it didnt work out well for WFYB
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:38:04 pvp in PC and WFYB is fundamentally different
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:38:29 concept of handguns wouldnt work here because the map is massive
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:38:34 and there is less focus on basic survival
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:39:00 builds can already outpace people at running speed by orders of magnitude too
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:39:04 so handguns become obsolete

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:51:26 how is that sus
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:18 but they are
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:29 it's the panzer wrap for SS divisions
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:46 so its fine
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:46 but theres no offensive markings on it
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:53:59 yeah yet we praise people like micheal wittman
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:08 he wasn't a war criminal
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:29 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:38 but we are talking about the Waffen-SS specifically
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:47 they were the ones that did the fighting
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:55:01 the regular SS were dedicated to committing warcrimes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:55:40 yes but waffen SS doesn't mean each individual member was a war criminal
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:55:46 whereas with regular SS you can argue that is the case
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:57:15 not really
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:57:19 you're the only one making an issue out of it lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:59:01 eh
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:59:21 even in PCC some of the symbolism is ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:59:55 its literally a panzer wrap man
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:00:11 no panzer crewman would have the time on their hands to be shooting jews
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:00:18 they had larger concerns to worry about
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:00:56 so tell me then
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:01:59 the entirety of germany was at his fingertips
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:02:10 so what now, can't wear civilian clothing from 1944?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:02:54 guys speaking german is bad now
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:02:58 moustache man spoke it
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:03:03 therefore if you speak it you're racist
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:04:26 why are you changing the subject
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:05:16 as long as they don't have any NSDAP symbolism
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:05:21 then there's no problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:06:43 why would you wear it in public though
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:06:58 thats like walking out in public with a WW1 uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:03 no one does that
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:07 unless they are in a reenactment
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:35 not randomly unless they're mentally ill
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:49 'but people do' is a futile argument since there are almost 8 billion people and there is at least 1 person that will do such a thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:02 stop trying to convince yourself that it's the norm
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:19 alright then we have an understanding
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:09:48 harry is pissed that someone is wearing a panzer uniform in roblox
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:09:53 he's shidding himself
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:10:18 uniform is more associated with iron cross
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:10:22 there is no NSDAP symbolism
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:11:02 randomly wearing military gear irl is frowned upon dumbass
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:11:10 no sane person would do that
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:11:18 you're not sane
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:11:50 harry
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:33 do you even know that foreign legions from annexed regions were part of the Waffen-SS
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:40 that doesn't necessarily make them war criminals since a lot of them were conscripted
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:55 they had no choice but to fight for germany
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:13:36 there were people literally conscripted lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:13:54 I thought you knew your stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:14:08 no you dont bro
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:14:34 yeah so you want to dishonor their existence by saying everyone that wore that uniform was a bad person?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:15:52 show me a statistic
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:15:54 then I'll believe you
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:17 show me where it says 90% of Waffen-SS panzer crewmen were involved in war crimes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:43 you bring up a point and refuse to elaborate
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:52 do you expect me to accept your argument as fact if you can't provide evidence
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:56 I want a statistic
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:01 not what you think
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:51 maybe roblox doesnt care then
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:52 lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:59 perhaps its not as offensive as you think
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:23:12 waffen-SS not allgemeine-SS
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:23:25 do you even know the difference
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:24:03 its undeniable both commit war crimes but to label each individual waffen-SS combatant as a bad person is simply false
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:24:34 the uniforms just stands for a panzer crewman
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:24:39 its not that deep
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:25:18 alright I don't think you even know lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:25:40 its funny how I invested this much time into trying to convince you that you're wrong
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:25:48 yet its as if you cover your ears and scream "LALALALA" as loud as you can
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:28:10 actually
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:28:26 the black uniform was also worn by regular panzertruppen of the wehrmacht
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:28:45 I had suspicions that was the case and had to check
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:08 its difficult to distinguish from the SS panzer uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:22 no no
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:25 you're crybabying over nothing
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:36 this entire argument has been for nothing
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:40 so what
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:44 stop crying
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:51 its literally a panzer wrap
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:31:27 could say that about the american uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:31:29 soviet uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:31:30 etc.

the-dump 2022-01-18 14:15:36 I agree
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:15:42 mental illness doesn't mean they still can't contribute to society
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:17:04 how aren't they
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:19:44 their brain is wired in a way that nullifies the evolutionary trait of being able to reproduce and this is not in any way considered normal
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:22:18 a gay person's behaviour can have noticeable differences between their straight counterparts
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:24:15 they have higher rates of depression, other mental disorders, suicidal thoughts, illicit substance usage and are more likely to engage in risky behaviour
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:24:36 not to mention that a good percentage of gays were abused as children
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:25:14 are you even going to try change my mind
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:25:32 I'm open to debate
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:04 yeah but it's not normal is it
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:09 they can't reproduce
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:10 they die off
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:38 so has mental illness
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:43 and every other disease though
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:27:40 ok but how does that suggest being gay isnt some sort of mental disorder
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:27:56 because a civilization can have high rates of illness yet be successful
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:28:38 I'm talking to you
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:29:29 eh mentally ill people can be 'stable'
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:09 no lol
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:28 things like mild autism can stablise as someone approachs adulthood
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:37 do you even know what you're talking about
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:31:44 so calling it a mental disorder may have some merit
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:33:05 I don't care what the verdict is but Total seems like he can't refute any of my points without resorting to insults
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:33:32 interesting
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:36:59 > This paper summarizes and analyzes that purported scientific evidence and explains that much (if not all) of the evidence is irrelevant and does not support the homo***uality-is-not-a-mental-disorder claim. As a result of their deficiencies and arbitrariness, the credibility those two groups that are typically deemed authoritative and trustworthy is called into question.

the-dump 2022-01-18 14:37:19 so it seems theres some controversy surrounding that paper

general 2022-02-08 05:09:14 that was already the general consensus for years now
general 2022-02-08 05:09:16 you just found out?
general 2022-02-08 05:09:33 missile actually dogshit lol
general 2022-02-08 05:09:52 when your build throttles the missiles end up blowing up your own build
general 2022-02-08 05:10:00 rockets randomly disappear
general 2022-02-08 05:10:02 close tracking fails to work
general 2022-02-08 05:10:05 they travel slowly
general 2022-02-08 05:10:07 sometimes fails to do any damage
general 2022-02-08 05:10:34 all weapons are bad
general 2022-02-08 05:10:39 you need to spam it
general 2022-02-08 05:10:50 at the point that you need to motorlock maxed out weapons in each other
general 2022-02-08 05:10:55 its not good
general 2022-02-08 05:12:07 nah the issue isnt making close tracking stronger
general 2022-02-08 05:12:11 it just doesnt work
general 2022-02-08 05:12:15 sometimes the closetracking overshoots
general 2022-02-08 05:12:25 othertimes the missile flies in circles around the build
general 2022-02-08 05:12:47 i've had times where a perfect shot without close tracking wouldve hit
general 2022-02-08 05:12:51 but close tracking messed it up
general 2022-02-08 05:13:06 close tracking did literally the opposite of tracking
general 2022-02-08 05:13:25 that needs fix then
general 2022-02-08 05:13:34 cant believe its been like that for years
general 2022-02-08 05:14:03 imo
general 2022-02-08 05:14:10 close tracking rockets should target engines
general 2022-02-08 05:14:20 since heat signatures and all that jazz
general 2022-02-08 05:14:26 so people can make actual flares
general 2022-02-08 05:14:30 bad luck lo
general 2022-02-08 05:14:57 what sort of plane has no engine though
general 2022-02-08 05:15:15 ok how about make it target magnets too
general 2022-02-08 05:15:17 ez
general 2022-02-08 05:16:01 or how about
general 2022-02-08 05:16:11 missiles **prefer** targetting engines
general 2022-02-08 05:16:18 but will still go for the plane even if it has none
general 2022-02-08 05:16:27 too op
general 2022-02-08 05:17:09 it wont always be a direct hit
general 2022-02-08 05:17:14 should just be general area
general 2022-02-08 05:17:19 plus people like to stuff engines internally too
general 2022-02-08 05:17:42 i mean
general 2022-02-08 05:18:14 i think all weapons should have reload speeds judging by how many of that weapon you have
general 2022-02-08 05:18:23 you have faster reload speeds if you have 1 rocket, compared to 5
general 2022-02-08 05:18:37 h igammara
general 2022-02-08 05:19:06 what do you guys think about being able to configure gun calibre
general 2022-02-08 05:19:24 the higher calibre guns you have, the less you can place
general 2022-02-08 05:19:33 with max calibre being 20mm
general 2022-02-08 05:19:42 not necessarily
general 2022-02-08 05:20:09 no
general 2022-02-08 05:20:11 max is 20mm
general 2022-02-08 05:20:44 br
general 2022-02-08 05:21:01 20mm should be max since thats the same diameter as most rotary cannons
general 2022-02-08 05:21:04 like CIWS and vulcan
general 2022-02-08 05:21:28 no
general 2022-02-08 05:21:32 a CIWS bullet will rip you to shreds
general 2022-02-08 05:21:35 a single one is all it takes
general 2022-02-08 05:21:56 there will be no bullet hole because your torso will be in different pieces
general 2022-02-08 05:22:25 yea
general 2022-02-08 05:22:27 weapons need weight
general 2022-02-08 05:23:37 60mm is tank rounds
general 2022-02-08 05:23:42 wont really make sense to have a full auto tank cannon
general 2022-02-08 05:24:06 too much
general 2022-02-08 05:24:11 irl 20mm is enough to shoot down modern jets
general 2022-02-08 05:24:34 just fireworks
general 2022-02-08 05:24:37 and rockets for that lol
general 2022-02-08 05:24:47 rockets need speed buff

the-dump 2022-03-13 01:35:31 you go to hell
general 2022-03-13 01:47:15 wtf
general 2022-03-13 01:47:15 16000 studs?
general 2022-03-13 01:48:05 super sprint with 16000 studs
general 2022-03-13 01:48:09 is still going to take a decade
general 2022-03-13 01:49:04 yeah so 484 seconds
general 2022-03-13 01:49:09 to run across the map to your friend
general 2022-03-13 01:49:25 160
general 2022-03-13 01:50:11 why do we want to throw away the ability to be able to build closely with our friends
general 2022-03-13 01:50:16 are you guys crazy
general 2022-03-13 01:51:07 option 2 is only good for PVP
general 2022-03-13 01:51:12 because you cant spawnkill
general 2022-03-13 01:51:21 the middle of the map will become a battleground rather than the spawnpoint
general 2022-03-13 01:52:25 just imagine trying to drive over to your friend's plot then getting the car stuck in a ditch
general 2022-03-13 01:52:34 remember, its almost 3 minutes at 100sps
general 2022-03-13 01:53:32 we can reach our farthest friend's plots in 20 seconds just by running, to achieve the same thing in pc2 we need a vehicle at 800sps
general 2022-03-13 01:53:34 are you guys sane?
general 2022-03-13 01:53:58 yea but that defeats the purpose of building vehicles to traverse the map
general 2022-03-13 01:54:21 hof mom
general 2022-03-13 01:54:22 ent
general 2022-03-13 01:54:41 no
general 2022-03-13 01:54:45 that will look dumb
general 2022-03-13 01:55:06 no friends moment
general 2022-03-13 01:55:56 and some people have builds that are two accounts worth of blocks that combine into one
general 2022-03-13 01:56:04 what are they supposed to do
general 2022-03-13 01:56:31 but
general 2022-03-13 01:56:47 also imagine trying to PVP, taking 2 minutes to reach the center of the map then dying to a single shredder
general 2022-03-13 01:57:13 rework for pc2
general 2022-03-13 01:58:16 just keep an area for the general spawn location for everyone
general 2022-03-13 01:58:20 but spread them out a little bit more
general 2022-03-13 01:58:28 dont need to put people on the opposite side of the map
general 2022-03-13 02:01:14 option 2 will make plot not a square
general 2022-03-13 02:01:19 we need square plot 😠
general 2022-03-13 02:01:47 but I want to build a square more easily
general 2022-03-13 02:02:40 20 player servers will be aids
general 2022-03-13 02:02:44 no pls
general 2022-03-13 02:03:01 people are annoying
general 2022-03-13 02:03:04 and more people = more annoyance
general 2022-03-13 02:03:10 unless they're your friends
general 2022-03-13 02:03:22 thats why we dont need 20 player servers you dingus
general 2022-03-13 02:03:54 what about 12 player servers with increase in all directions
general 2022-03-13 02:04:38 yeah can't we still do 12 players then
general 2022-03-13 02:05:27 alright how about
general 2022-03-13 02:05:31 turn the plot into a triangle
general 2022-03-13 02:05:34 and 12 player servers
general 2022-03-13 02:05:36 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-03-13 02:07:12 <@!217336009455566848> what about 20 players but a smaller increase in size for all directions
general 2022-03-13 02:07:24 so we can keep square plot
general 2022-03-13 02:07:37 SQUARE
general 2022-03-13 02:07:58 SQUARE
general 2022-03-13 02:08:00 SQUARE
general 2022-03-13 02:08:05 ⬜
general 2022-03-13 02:08:34 CIRCLE
general 2022-03-13 02:08:34 CIRCLE
general 2022-03-13 02:08:38 ⚪
general 2022-03-13 02:08:56 square will have the same area as the rectangle
general 2022-03-13 02:09:00 hence why its a smaller increase in all directions
general 2022-03-13 02:09:09 because you need to adjust for another axis
general 2022-03-13 02:09:17 basic maths
general 2022-03-13 02:09:27 lol
general 2022-03-13 02:09:40 so rick can we have a square with the same area as option 2's rectangle
general 2022-03-13 02:09:45 nothing
general 2022-03-13 02:10:49 thats what i said
general 2022-03-13 02:10:51 like 3 times
general 2022-03-13 02:12:14 a lot of people have motorlocks that extend out to the sides
general 2022-03-13 02:12:19 because lengthwise takes space
general 2022-03-13 02:12:25 why are we sacrificing width
general 2022-03-13 02:12:45 just increase in all directions
general 2022-03-13 02:13:09 we don't just build planes rick
general 2022-03-13 02:13:17 tons of other vehicles
general 2022-03-13 02:13:22 buildings, even
general 2022-03-13 02:13:44 hell someone's built an entire mcdonalds
general 2022-03-13 02:13:47 they need WIDTH for that
general 2022-03-13 02:14:56 yeah because building a motorlocked plane is that easy
general 2022-03-13 02:15:02 JUST the wings
general 2022-03-13 02:15:03 lo
general 2022-03-13 02:15:15 no it isnt
general 2022-03-13 02:15:21 do you even play this game mate
general 2022-03-13 02:15:58 alright to make everyone happier

general 2022-03-15 12:33:58 pro
general 2022-03-15 12:34:34 which one
general 2022-03-15 12:34:51 what
general 2022-03-15 12:35:08 the one with red primer?
general 2022-03-15 12:35:17 that looks poopoo
general 2022-03-15 12:35:18 why
general 2022-03-15 12:36:03 yea its poop camo
general 2022-03-15 12:36:06 someone 1v1 me https://www.roblox.com/games/2591458788/S-I-C-E
general 2022-03-15 12:36:39 this one is really late war right
general 2022-03-15 12:37:00 because the 1 sideskirt and red primer
general 2022-03-15 12:37:05 suggests that it was made during a shortage
general 2022-03-15 12:37:10 and more often than not, during the end of the war
general 2022-03-15 12:37:23 yea lots of panther gs are like that
general 2022-03-15 12:38:13 wait
general 2022-03-15 12:38:16 so no turret at the start?
general 2022-03-15 12:38:33 that'd make sense then since its in poob factory paint
general 2022-03-15 12:38:55 still no one to 1v1
general 2022-03-15 12:38:58 😔
general 2022-03-15 12:39:26 yea
general 2022-03-15 12:39:39 then they started mishmashing hulls and turrets
general 2022-03-15 12:39:58 so we get the beautiful panther tiger
general 2022-03-15 12:40:10 nobody was talking to you
general 2022-03-15 12:40:12 get out of here loser
general 2022-03-15 12:40:29 eh idk
general 2022-03-15 12:40:32 doesn't sit right with me
general 2022-03-15 12:40:48 the paint doesn't suggest that it's seen much combat and is battle hardened
general 2022-03-15 12:40:58 because crews often end up putting their own custom paint

general 2022-03-25 10:40:13 good
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:40:59 weight doesnt alter falling speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:41:15 its more so if the bomb itself has wings then the bomb sight is rendered useless
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:41:45 idk but to suggest that weight alters the speed of a falling object is scientifically false
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:43:30 i also disagree with the bomb sight idea, not because its too complex (im sure rickje can make it), but it doesnt suit a game where you have to build mechanical constructs yourselves
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:43:47 its not fundamental, if you get what i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:44:12 it actually is
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 10:44:29 but we don't really need something that a small portion of players will use

general 2022-03-26 10:23:35 you can also put an engine that counteracts the tilting action of the sub
general 2022-03-26 10:25:08 ok i made very elaborate diagram of my second solution

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:16:22 i went through calculator for one hour
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:16:26 just to make sure everything is scaled right
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:17:05 why not
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:17:42 it's easier to get more detail on a large scale build

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:21:24 this?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:21:53 fard

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:22:45 br

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:43:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:43:20 what is your problemo
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:44:05 ok so you can use control panels
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:44:10 or propellors on either side to turn
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:44:51 wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:45:02 could they potentially use a motor's torque
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:45:09 to power the turning
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:46:22 so they way they turn is the driver leans
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:46:51 handle alone wont make it turn
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:47:12 propellor only sol rn

general 2022-03-28 10:43:04 a robloxian is 5 studs tall, now if you consider a robloxian to be 0.0017km, roughly in accordance with the average male height this gives:
0.0017km/5 meaning we get 340000 micrometers per stud.
therefore: 2.5 x 340000 = 850000

**8.5 decimetres for 2.5 studs**
general 2022-03-28 10:43:36 85 centimeters

general 2022-03-28 10:43:55 you need to use average human height
general 2022-03-28 10:44:02 4'6 will be ridiculous
general 2022-03-28 10:44:52 what
general 2022-03-28 10:44:58 a to-scale model of what
general 2022-03-28 10:45:21 wtf
general 2022-03-28 10:45:21 in your garage?
general 2022-03-28 10:45:40 plane crazy
general 2022-03-28 10:45:42 or actual garage
general 2022-03-28 10:45:59 why do you need studs
general 2022-03-28 12:02:26 how
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:03:35 has anybody ever made the Ark from halo
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:03:58 the ark
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:04:01 construction site of the halos
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:04:39 the ark is 10x larger than earth
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:04:40 in diameter
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:04:52 whoever wants to build that have fun lo
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:06:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:06:34 probably similar program to shader
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:06:57 yea so the ark has to be 12x larger than that
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:07:13 then there's the greater ark which would be 36x larger
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:08:48 60 year old baby
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:08:50 wow
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:09:14 somebody should make roscale milky way galaxy
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:09:23 would be pretty ez ngl
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:14:25 
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:14:26 build this

plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:15:52 19dx3
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:16:33 why did you allow some randos to win an iom vs forerunner debate
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:16:55 yea i was searching for mentions of forerunner cos i want to see what builds people had
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:17:03 then I found the discussion
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:17:37 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/495286269459300364/860434620557951021
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 12:17:52 that man was wrong and you didnt say anything
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:20:49 yes also
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:21:33 they have hundreds of quadrillions to quintillions of weapon-ships + sentinels
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:22:51 they literally have more automated weapons than men in the imperial guard
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:22:53 they clap so ez
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:11 plus a single hunter-killer FIGHTER was considered enough to kill the spirit of fire
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:24 a venatores warrior servant controlled a million of those hunter killers
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:36 there were trillions of warrior servants
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:08 the forerunners also had time manipulation
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:12 in the form of slipspace bubbles
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:18 yes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:24 not time manipulation in the normal sense
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:28 but they could freeze an object in time
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:45 by doing this they could render something invulnerable to damage
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:25:12 also warrior servants, in combat skins, could fly through a mountain at speeds of much higher magnitude than sound
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:25:29 they clap the space marines so hard its not even funny
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:26:01 using their war sphinxes they can burn a city in moments
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:26:25 we havent even gotten to constraint fields yet
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:03 also the first set of 12 halo rings were directional
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:05 it didnt kill all life EVERYWHERE
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:14 so they could just use it on IoM star clusters
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:28:17 also forerunners had the composer so they could turn entire armies against their will and make them forcefully fight for the ecumene
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:02 why does anyone think IoM stands a chance against forerunners
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:13 its such a stomp its ridiculous
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:39 not to mention that the forerunners had tens of millions of naval warships
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:49 including millions of dreadnaughts that used gravity as a weapon
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:00 tearing entire enemy starships apart just using gravitational waves
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:10 not to mention the planet-killing starships
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:53 the forerunners could make stars supernova
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:58 wiping out everything in the vicinity of the system
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:31:44 the forerunner fleet was virtually omnipresent in comparison to the imperial navy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:31:51 travel in the warp can take weeks, even years
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:32:01 forerunner ships can travel across the galaxy in minutes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:32:30 also the forerunner ships can take a beating like champs
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:33:10 the didact didn't even notice the relatively small hole that the Infinity's super macs made in the mantle's approach
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:33:21 and plus forerunner ships had the ability to self-repair
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:05 yes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:13 he wouldnt have cared
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:42 cos the people who build halo stuff in this server are addicted to UNSC and covenant
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:45 nothing else
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:15 yea unsc get vanished instantly lo
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:32 nah covenant dies too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:43 their empire is quite small
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:50 it only covers a fraction of the milky way
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:51 btw
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:36:31 they had poor leadership too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:36:48 they'd kill themselves before the IoM does anything lol
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:21 they can if its at the beginning
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:25 humanity and the covenant succeeded
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:29 the IoM should too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:42 if it spreads beyond a few star systems the entire galaxy is fucked
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:16 imperium of mankind
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:40 silentium flood also had access to indestructible weaponized star roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:47 the imperium cant do anything
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:58 it took the halos to destroy the star roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:03 the imperium has nothing like that
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:13 the flood likes mass
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:15 it likes a lot of mass
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:21 imperium going to be dinner
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:42 the forerunners had 300 million colonized worlds alone
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:51 they had billions more uninhabited worlds under their control
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:40:53 factual
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:41:53 while intelligence of hosts does matter, biomass also increases its computational power
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:03 they can form a gravemind on a single planet within a day or two
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:41 man who needs weapons
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:48 flood literally threw SPACESHIPS at the enemy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:43:35 throw rocks
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:43:36 easy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:45:18 lets say, a single ship worth
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:45:25 like how high charity was infected within a day
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:08 why
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:21 gang warfare
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:22 what
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:39 flood infects people within seconds of death
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:47:13 the flood dont necessarily need creatures with nervous systems
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:47:17 they can use them as biomass to create pure forms
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:49:24 exponential growth
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:50:48 using slipspace, the forerunners could visit other dimensions
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:50:52 so the flood could literally do the same
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:52:07 why is it poorly understood
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:52:39 br
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:53:11 how large is the imperial navy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:02 which faction
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:07 so
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:13 the flood had access to precursor weapons
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:16 and constructions
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:19 the precursors were gods
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:26 listen man
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:45 do you think the IoM stands a chance against indestructible extradimensional weaponized space roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:53 which the flood used
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:56:07 the halos were the only thing able to take it on
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:56:15 does the IoM have anything like the halos
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:10 so how do they even make stuff
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:26 where does their industry come from
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:35 if barely anyone in the imperium is smart enough to build
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:59:08 ok so hear me out

general 2022-04-06 03:04:34 yuck
general 2022-04-06 03:04:37 shity game
general 2022-04-06 03:05:00 phantom forces has worse anticheat than csgo
general 2022-04-06 03:05:28 lazy dev
general 2022-04-06 03:05:35 guns and attachments all shit too
general 2022-04-06 03:05:37 they are all reskins
general 2022-04-06 03:05:41 and spawns are the worst
general 2022-04-06 03:05:46 you can spawn literally behind an enemy
general 2022-04-06 03:06:13 the weapons and attachments look different but dont feel different
general 2022-04-06 03:06:15 they the same shit
general 2022-04-06 03:06:21 devs cant bring anything new to the table
general 2022-04-06 03:06:42 gunplay is pretty shit too
general 2022-04-06 03:07:05 there is no skill in phantom forces
general 2022-04-06 03:07:26 there is no strategy or tactics in phantom forces
general 2022-04-06 03:07:32 how is it fun
general 2022-04-06 03:08:03 remember the bfg
general 2022-04-06 03:08:12 the developers are so lazy that they made a reskin of it
general 2022-04-06 03:08:26 no
general 2022-04-06 03:08:29 idk
general 2022-04-06 03:08:41 i bought it with credits years ago
general 2022-04-06 03:08:50 then i realised the hot trash it was
general 2022-04-06 03:09:22 the anime sights are stupid
general 2022-04-06 03:09:29 hate that shit
general 2022-04-06 03:09:42 I remember when phantom forces had a semi real-world theme
general 2022-04-06 03:09:48 now they add the most random stuff
general 2022-04-06 03:09:52 terminator sight attachment? wtf
general 2022-04-06 03:10:08 phantom forces is bad
general 2022-04-06 03:10:21 the game is a skill issue
general 2022-04-06 03:10:23 devs are lazy
general 2022-04-06 03:10:38 at its core, its just a point and click shooter since 2015
general 2022-04-06 03:10:45 there are better fps
general 2022-04-06 03:11:04 remember when I asked people to play SICE
general 2022-04-06 03:11:07 but almost no one came
general 2022-04-06 03:11:21 bad busines is ass
general 2022-04-06 03:11:25 they add trans and lgbt skins
general 2022-04-06 03:11:31 disgusting game
general 2022-04-06 03:11:54 deadline is ok
general 2022-04-06 03:12:07 the way they set up gun customization is counterintuitive though
general 2022-04-06 03:12:15 u have to go through so many buttons
general 2022-04-06 03:12:20 just to be able to change your gun
general 2022-04-06 03:12:33 thats a lot of time out of the fight
general 2022-04-06 03:12:44 u cant
general 2022-04-06 03:12:51 it slows you down and it punishes you for run and gun
general 2022-04-06 03:13:14 oh phantom forces
general 2022-04-06 03:13:18 yes PF run and gun is dumb
general 2022-04-06 03:13:25 doesnt make sense to be running around with a sniper rifle or lmg
general 2022-04-06 03:14:03 I also remember that time when german mg42s ran onto the beaches of normandy straight into the allies

help 2022-04-09 03:00:42 could be the torque on your propellor motor
help 2022-04-09 03:01:08 dont max it
help 2022-04-09 03:01:19 just put it to the smallest value that is viable
help 2022-04-09 03:01:21 then test it out
help 2022-04-09 03:03:37 make sure your control panels are configured correctly too
general 2022-04-09 03:09:26 epic embed fail
help 2022-04-09 03:10:18 you need double motors on the wheels that power the treads
help 2022-04-09 03:10:32 first set, will be for W and S (forwards and backwards)
help 2022-04-09 03:10:51 second set will be for A and D (left and right)
help 2022-04-09 03:11:16 so what you want to do with the second set, is configure it in a way that one tread goes backward, and the other goes forward
help 2022-04-09 03:11:25 this will give you steering

general 2022-04-09 03:22:18 arsenal is ok
general 2022-04-09 03:22:25 exploiters arent a huge deal compared to some other games
general 2022-04-09 03:22:26 like PF
general 2022-04-09 03:22:44 whose devs fail to make a basic working anticheat for as long as the game has existed
general 2022-04-09 03:23:20 pf is dogshit
general 2022-04-09 03:23:27 all guns are clones of each other, under a different name and model
general 2022-04-09 03:23:31 BFG? Hecate? same thing
general 2022-04-09 03:23:36 all assault rifles? feels the same
general 2022-04-09 03:23:57 then you got stupid attachments like the blue, green, red laser
general 2022-04-09 03:24:08 that somehow REDUCE recoil
general 2022-04-09 03:24:35 all of the attachments on PF are clones too
general 2022-04-09 03:24:40 most suppressors perform very similarly
general 2022-04-09 03:24:42 they're just reskins tbh
general 2022-04-09 03:24:58 even scp sl
general 2022-04-09 03:25:02 has better gunplay than phantom forces
general 2022-04-09 03:25:06 💀
general 2022-04-09 03:25:17 what is outside
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:25:45 no one cares tbh
general 2022-04-09 03:26:24 shittest panther i have ever seen
general 2022-04-09 03:26:39 turret offscale from hull
general 2022-04-09 03:26:43 and mantlet non existent
general 2022-04-09 03:27:03 no this is pretty bad
general 2022-04-09 03:27:06 even pub server panthers are better
general 2022-04-09 03:27:34 every single part of that tank
general 2022-04-09 03:27:35 is wrong
general 2022-04-09 03:27:40 not an exaggeration
general 2022-04-09 03:27:46 show me one
general 2022-04-09 03:28:27 I said show me one
general 2022-04-09 03:28:31 not that hard to search in creations
general 2022-04-09 03:30:08 that is unironically better
general 2022-04-09 03:30:31 at least their panther turret angles fit well
general 2022-04-09 03:30:48 the detailing is also better
general 2022-04-09 03:30:51 than one randomass flag
general 2022-04-09 03:30:58 turret shit
general 2022-04-09 03:31:00 hull is better
general 2022-04-09 03:31:26 
general 2022-04-09 03:31:33 compare hull
general 2022-04-09 03:32:13 no
general 2022-04-09 03:32:22 better than no mantlet
general 2022-04-09 03:32:23 💀

creations-chat 2022-04-09 03:39:04 is it pro-schutzstaffel to make a tiger I?
is it pro-CCP to make a type 80?
is it pro taliban to make a toyota pickup truck?
is it pro-north korea to make a hwasong-15?

no of course not
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:40:00 dumb question
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:44:35 we need actual cannons in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:44:43 kinetic-based weaponry
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:44:52 rockets and fireworks are shit to use
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:45:23 yea
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:45:37 faster than rockets, but unguided and has drop
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:45:55 damage slightly less
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:45:58 nah
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:46:04 rockets will be obsolete
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:46:16 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:46:20 like the cannons in besiege
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:46:53 you're gay
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:47:00 HE will make rockets and fireworks useless
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:47:24 rockets in this game are slow
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:47:30 no one is going to use them if cannons get HE
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:49:04 not a good comparison for a lego game to irl
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:49:25 because unlike irl
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:49:27 rockets are shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:49:44 you'd be looking at one shot kills on MBTs with a rocket
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:49:53 so you cant compare irl to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:50:22 pvp weapons need to not be affected by throttling
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:50:33 I love when the game lags to the point
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:50:37 that my rockets barely travel 1 stud per second
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:50:40 and just blow my own build up
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:51:04 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:51:09 logistics will never be in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:51:59 so what we have established so far is
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:52:05 fireworks and rockets need speed buff, right?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:52:43 we already have guns
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:52:47 rickje is reworking guns already
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:53:04 how does that make sense though
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:53:17 no it doesnt make sense at all
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:53:29 whats the point of increased range if you cant even hit your target
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:53:43 and no
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:53:47 it needs to reward good aim
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:54:04 being a shitty pvp player
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:54:09 already punishes them enough
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:54:13 and gun dps is garbage
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:54:35 you need 10 stacked guns to even have a chance of killing a shredder before it destroys your land-based vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:58:50 only reason that sort of stuff is meta
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:58:56 is because conventional weapons are trash
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 03:59:32 shredder bugs will cease to exist if guns werent dogshit
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:00:04 and that should be a thing
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:00:17 it has to be rewarding to get the plane crazy equivalent of an ammorack
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:02:23 and its a shame people even have to do this
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:02:30 the meta is bad because the pvp weapons are bad
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:02:39 the issue is not with cutters, but normal pvp weapons being shit to use
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:02:52 which fails to even hit a target
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:02:53 💀
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:03:19 rockets are too slow
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:03:24 and throttle the same as the rest of your build
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:03:45 giant mech builds with swords are cool though
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:04:15 when rickje allows for multiple keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:04:19 or logic gets added
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:05:18 an airburst option for rockets would be nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:06:25 i’d like a toggeable UI that shows the rocket reload
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:06:46 same with fireworks
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:07:19 if guns had a damage buff
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:07:24 they should require reloads too
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:07:47 like 75 shots before a 3 second reload
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:07:50 something like that
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:08:57 i’ve always had the thought of a document for pvp suggestions

plane-crazy 2022-04-09 08:43:49 yes

plane-crazy 2022-04-10 00:13:42 nice strawman
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 00:13:52 we talking about shermans
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 00:13:56 what you bring up is completely irrelevant

general 2022-04-10 00:15:23 unde alert
general 2022-04-10 00:15:43 
general 2022-04-10 00:19:47 undes are always stupid
general 2022-04-10 00:19:59 and homework is a good indicator of someone's age
general 2022-04-10 00:20:07 if somebody is doing short division for maths homework
general 2022-04-10 00:20:14 then they are very likely unde
general 2022-04-10 00:20:29 it's worked for the past few years
general 2022-04-10 00:20:43 don't say no when you have no basis to prove your point
general 2022-04-10 00:21:24 high school work is always distinguishable from primary school
general 2022-04-10 00:21:41 doesn't matter if its linear equations or pythagoras' theorem
general 2022-04-10 00:22:05 ^
general 2022-04-10 00:22:14 they dont
general 2022-04-10 00:22:22 pythagoras is year 8-9 level
general 2022-04-10 00:22:37 13+
general 2022-04-10 00:22:54 no but they generally share the same grade system
general 2022-04-10 00:23:00 dude
general 2022-04-10 00:23:10 exactly
general 2022-04-10 00:23:24 idk why you're trying to justify that we shouldnt check undes
general 2022-04-10 00:23:30 especially when it's against discord TOS
general 2022-04-10 00:23:51 and server moderators are therefore liable for allowing TOS to be broken
general 2022-04-10 00:24:22 its not like homework is the only method too
general 2022-04-10 00:24:30 HW isn't the primary indicator
general 2022-04-10 00:24:53 idk what you're on about my guy
general 2022-04-10 00:25:20 and unde checks DO work
general 2022-04-10 00:25:25 so they aren't useless
general 2022-04-10 00:25:45 "just"
general 2022-04-10 00:25:48 tells me you don't understand the process
general 2022-04-10 00:25:54 you need to stop talking about things you don't know about
general 2022-04-10 00:26:02 really
general 2022-04-10 00:26:19 i've seen people get checked by other methods

general 2022-04-10 00:34:12 no it isnt
general 2022-04-10 00:35:50 just because they can't ban all of them doesn't mean an effort shouldn't be made
general 2022-04-10 00:35:56 they enforce ToS for a reason
general 2022-04-10 00:36:26 they aren't lol
general 2022-04-10 00:36:52 sure, maybe some servers are
general 2022-04-10 00:36:56 but that bares no relation on PCC
general 2022-04-10 00:37:45 yes
general 2022-04-10 00:39:25 they're too stupid too
general 2022-04-10 00:39:42 and they end up revealing themselves on an alt anyway
general 2022-04-10 00:39:49 happened lots of times
general 2022-04-10 00:39:57 undes arent that smart
general 2022-04-10 00:40:02 they think they are
general 2022-04-10 00:40:04 but they aren't
general 2022-04-10 00:40:17 a 12 year old knows lots of things
general 2022-04-10 00:40:19 but they lack the wisdom
general 2022-04-10 00:40:31 yes it is
general 2022-04-10 00:40:45 what are you on about lol
general 2022-04-10 00:40:53 what do you not understand
general 2022-04-10 00:40:54 about an IP ban
general 2022-04-10 00:41:34 they can still access on another device
general 2022-04-10 00:41:45 and I don't know why an older brother would allow their younger to break ToS
general 2022-04-10 00:41:50 even if they know their risks
general 2022-04-10 00:42:07 everything you say is irrelevant to the current discussion about unde checks
general 2022-04-10 00:42:48 ok then that's their fault for being punished for breaking ToS
general 2022-04-10 00:43:38 why would an older brother give their younger sibling unrestricted internet access on their device
general 2022-04-10 00:43:46 speaking from experience, I ALWAYS monitor this
general 2022-04-10 00:44:05 I said their device
general 2022-04-10 00:44:08 dude can you read pls
general 2022-04-10 00:44:26 and the argument you're trying to make here is pointless lol
general 2022-04-10 00:44:34 12 year olds can access internet easily? ok so what?
general 2022-04-10 00:44:38 you want to allow them to break discord tos?
general 2022-04-10 00:44:42 is that it?
general 2022-04-10 00:45:11 this server's policy on undes has worked for years
general 2022-04-10 00:45:14 nothing needed to change
general 2022-04-10 00:45:18 nothing needs to change
general 2022-04-10 00:45:50 if someone gets mistaken as a 12 yo
general 2022-04-10 00:45:59 then they are that stupid and immature they deserve to be banned anyway
general 2022-04-10 00:46:15 this server doesn't play games with unde checks
general 2022-04-10 00:46:28 yes it is a reason to get banned
general 2022-04-10 00:46:35 stupidity is the reason why people break other rules
general 2022-04-10 00:47:00 you suggesting that you want to be unde checked via another method?
general 2022-04-10 00:47:05 because im sure rbk can arrange that for you
general 2022-04-10 00:47:11 in this server its a reason to get banned
general 2022-04-10 00:47:50 stupid people end up breaking other rules
general 2022-04-10 00:47:52 we don't need rule 14
general 2022-04-10 00:48:12 yes the common sense rule is a thing
general 2022-04-10 00:48:41 so skylox
general 2022-04-10 00:48:45 do you want another unde check?
general 2022-04-10 00:48:53 you did say the HW check system is flawed
general 2022-04-10 00:49:02 ok <@466793357318815744>
general 2022-04-10 00:52:24 skylox is volunteering for another unde check lol
general 2022-04-10 00:52:45 how old even are you
general 2022-04-10 00:53:26 ok so 14
general 2022-04-10 00:53:45 no skylox it isnt
general 2022-04-10 00:53:52 not really
general 2022-04-10 00:54:01 your age isnt considered private info anyway
general 2022-04-10 00:54:06 ok then leave
general 2022-04-10 00:54:12 im serious just leave
general 2022-04-10 00:54:18 say it
general 2022-04-10 00:54:22 you're not an unde?
general 2022-04-10 00:54:29 im questioning that
general 2022-04-10 00:54:31 then how old are you
general 2022-04-10 00:54:34 not that hard
general 2022-04-10 00:54:39 it really isnt that hard
general 2022-04-10 00:54:44 how old are you
general 2022-04-10 00:54:53 you're just saying that
general 2022-04-10 00:54:56 but you won't even reveal your age
general 2022-04-10 00:55:00 nice strawman
general 2022-04-10 00:55:03 can't think of anything else to say?
general 2022-04-10 00:55:06 bring up irrelevant topics?
general 2022-04-10 00:55:28 you are the reason the common sense rule exists
general 2022-04-10 00:56:08 we have already told you that the global education system is similar
general 2022-04-10 00:56:10 what do you not understand
general 2022-04-10 00:56:17 is it that difficult
general 2022-04-10 00:56:45 no shit
general 2022-04-10 00:56:50 but its largely the same
general 2022-04-10 01:01:21 pretty funny

plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:16:13 people only care about the look

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:19:43 not enough speed for take off
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:19:58 when it falls it gains that extra bit of speed that helps it to take off
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:20:11 either that or more lift
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:21:14 or perhaps
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:21:32 your vehicle is tilted slightly towards the forward end of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:22:00 and because of that the thrust is absorbed by the ground
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:22:12 send me a screenshot of your plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:23:01 go test mode
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:25:08 send it in build mode

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:26:25 I mean flight mode
general 2022-04-12 09:31:29 we live in a society
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:29:25 why trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:29:26 lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:37:25 it will be
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:38:07 just use helium lo
general 2022-04-12 10:46:01 pf is so lame that a shotgun with a slug feels identical to a sniper rifle
general 2022-04-12 10:46:36 spawns trash too
general 2022-04-12 10:47:00 cant tell you the amount of time I’ve used the default spawn (not on teammate) only to get headshot in the back 2 seconds later
general 2022-04-12 10:48:25 and its always been like this for years lol
general 2022-04-12 10:48:27 even in pre alpha
general 2022-04-12 10:49:09 and ironically when anti exploit in roblox games is generally improving, phantom forces downgraded their anticheat
general 2022-04-12 10:49:48 I find less aimbotters in an unranked match of csgo than in pf
general 2022-04-12 10:49:53 no joke
general 2022-04-12 10:50:55 yea but you’d think a studio with multiple scripters would be able to mitigate the exploiting problem, like many other fps games already have
general 2022-04-12 10:51:24 even arsenal has less hackers lol
general 2022-04-12 10:51:39 pf does
general 2022-04-12 10:51:42 but it barely works
general 2022-04-12 10:52:00 whatever they try, its clearly not working lol
general 2022-04-12 10:52:13 pf is by far the game with the most exploiters
general 2022-04-12 10:52:29 bad business isnt that bad compared to pf
general 2022-04-12 10:52:43 never played it dont want to
general 2022-04-12 10:52:46 seems cancer
general 2022-04-12 10:56:05 why would you play criminality
general 2022-04-12 10:56:10 its a shitty payday2
general 2022-04-12 10:56:24 get the real thing
general 2022-04-12 10:56:34 its like playing CB:RO when you can instead just play CSGO lo
general 2022-04-12 10:56:55 
general 2022-04-12 10:57:32 roblox games rn are pretty dogwater
general 2022-04-12 10:58:02 dont shit on robloxity though
general 2022-04-12 10:58:04 that was the best
general 2022-04-12 10:58:12 I was a warclanner for years
general 2022-04-12 10:58:32 it was quite unique
general 2022-04-12 10:58:34 only one other game like it
general 2022-04-12 10:58:39 yea
general 2022-04-12 10:58:44 and roleplaying 123 for hot bf
general 2022-04-12 10:58:55 good times
general 2022-04-12 10:59:23 I remember when roblox had a select set of messages you could use
general 2022-04-12 10:59:46 tycoons were great
general 2022-04-12 10:59:54 problem is nowadays no one is innovating
general 2022-04-12 11:00:00 tycoons are the same trash tbh
general 2022-04-12 11:00:04 there is no creativity
general 2022-04-12 11:00:12 lumber tycoon was way ahead of its time though
general 2022-04-12 11:00:50 buy all the gamepasses simulator
general 2022-04-12 11:00:52 waste your robux simulator
general 2022-04-12 11:01:02 spam click for 5 hours straight simulator
general 2022-04-12 11:02:16 bad ui though
general 2022-04-12 11:02:24 menu is really cluttered
general 2022-04-12 11:02:35 does sight zeroing even work
general 2022-04-12 11:02:53 how do you even zero sights without a rangefinder
general 2022-04-12 11:03:00 or similar tools
general 2022-04-12 11:03:11 yes
general 2022-04-12 11:03:56 sfoh is the best fighting game
general 2022-04-12 11:04:00 change my mind
general 2022-04-12 11:06:09 dont like
general 2022-04-12 11:06:18 bad UI, even for its time
general 2022-04-12 11:06:21 gameplay was ok
general 2022-04-12 11:07:10 have you guys played that bootleg scp sl on roblox
general 2022-04-12 11:07:35 on roblox yea
general 2022-04-12 11:07:52 it isnt
general 2022-04-12 11:07:56 no objective
general 2022-04-12 11:08:10 you do nothing but build out of ikea couches
general 2022-04-12 11:08:16 thats not fun when you do it for hours
general 2022-04-12 11:08:24 the enemies all the same
general 2022-04-12 11:09:44 I spend more time on reddit than roblox
general 2022-04-12 11:09:50 roblox just that bad rn
general 2022-04-12 11:10:16 perhaps
general 2022-04-12 11:11:12 I reckon that we’ve outgrown roblox, or are starting to
general 2022-04-12 11:11:25 so at this point we can actually see how lame the entire site is

general 2022-12-09 06:32:16 illegal because it is discrimination against mute people
general 2022-12-09 06:35:05 yes but communicating “hi” is ableist because it downplays the challenges that mute and deaf people face when communicating with others
general 2022-12-09 06:35:12 therefore, talking is illegal
general 2022-12-09 06:35:58 it does matter

general 2022-12-09 06:39:52 its the obvious truth
general 2022-12-09 06:40:11 the war is not for mere politics or territory
general 2022-12-09 06:40:16 it is a war of furry and man

general 2022-12-09 06:41:20 most countries back ukraine because they want to preserve humanity’s existence
general 2022-12-09 06:42:39 did you know that history museums actually hide evidence of furries dating back to the beginning of mankind

general 2022-12-16 11:30:01 ok bye
general 2022-12-16 11:53:37 help me!
general 2022-12-16 11:55:48 i am being abused
general 2022-12-16 14:35:25 hoi5
general 2022-12-16 14:35:28 real
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:38:44 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:39:09 then if its meters why are you multiplying km/h
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:46:10 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:46:28 <@707777796843372554> brother please educate them
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:47:32 this stuff is primary school math
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:47:40 yall need unde check
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:48:52 in real life
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:49:05 but plane crazy uses diff scale
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:49:19 because people tend to build roscale (1:1)
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:49:22 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:49:27 then that would make a robloxian 5m
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:49:53 let a robloxian be 2m
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:50:25 ok 1.8
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:50:32 but I rounded for simplicity
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:50:53 love you but pls quiet
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:51:07 im having a conversation
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:51:12 with my class d brother
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:52:29 1.8/5 because a robloxian is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:52:36 1 stud is 0.36m
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:53:10 approx, depending on if you round to 2m or use slightly diff scale for a robloxian height
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:53:59 idk ask rick
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:54:12 or someone who has the game files
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:54:55 doesnt seem farfetched tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:55:48 in roscale yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:56:17 0.36
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:56:31 dont round off
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:56:53 we let it be 1.8
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:57:23 I mean ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:57:28 0.33 good enough
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:58:02 now we conver st/s to km/h
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:58:11 which some pissfarts cant do
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:58:48 ok 1 m/s = 0.36 st/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:00:40 shid
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:00:46 ok its 2am
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:00:49 let me redo
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:01:05 1m/s = 3.6 st/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:01:35 1km/h = 1st/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:01:37 eas
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:02:54 gn
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:05:02 ok I just fixed it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:05:37 so guys it appears 1km/h correlates with 1st/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:05:41 easy metric
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:12:58 the wackest measurement system
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:13:16 1km has 1000m, 1m has 100cm
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:13:35 why does burgerland have to make conversions so complicated
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:16:45 and britain is officially metric
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:17:10 anerica adopted the shittiest scale available, and there were only 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:17:47 dude only 3 countries use imperial
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:17:59 literally the rest of the colonies switched to metric too
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:18:33 because its just that much better
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 15:18:56 but now you cant do a widespread switch cos america shot itself in the foot
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 01:27:11 because its better
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 01:29:10 conversions are easier and the units actually make sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 01:29:47 ex: 1mL of water = 1cm^3 of water = 1g
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 01:30:16 there's a reason it's the universal standard
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:13:07 that is a plane crazy problem
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:13:10 because pvp is dogshit
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:28:25 why spring for suspension
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:28:34 just use the normal suspension lol
the-dump 2022-12-17 07:29:55 cos baby you're a firework
general 2022-12-17 07:46:49 are you an experienced developer
general 2022-12-17 07:50:13 but how do you know it'll take 1-5 months
general 2022-12-17 14:28:57 the sun is flat
general 2022-12-17 14:36:58 what is meta in tanmk
general 2022-12-17 14:37:09 7-8
general 2022-12-17 14:37:18 i have faux and 8.8 ikonisch rn
general 2022-12-17 14:37:36 what could I step up
general 2022-12-17 14:37:46 should I bring my gun to a tier 9
general 2022-12-17 14:37:51 while under tier the armour
general 2022-12-17 14:38:22 so should I upgrade my armour or gun first
general 2022-12-17 14:38:34 i'll try bring all to tier 8
general 2022-12-17 14:38:36 instead of going to t7 first
general 2022-12-17 14:39:17 only the faux hull
general 2022-12-17 14:39:28 wait
general 2022-12-17 14:39:47 is the 8.8 tier 6 or 7
general 2022-12-17 14:39:54 I havent played in a long time
general 2022-12-17 14:40:08 ikonisch
general 2022-12-17 14:41:03 so even if my gun is tier 6
general 2022-12-17 14:41:06 can I just skip to t8
general 2022-12-17 14:41:32 I heard molotok was good too
general 2022-12-17 14:41:35 but that was long ago
general 2022-12-17 14:41:54 ok me stream pro tank gameing
general 2022-12-17 14:42:45 im shid
general 2022-12-17 14:44:04 ok so in order
general 2022-12-17 14:44:35 should I bring my gun from t7>t8, then hull from t6>t8, then turret from t7>t8
general 2022-12-17 14:44:43 or go hull first since thats under
general 2022-12-17 14:45:37 yea I get one shot
general 2022-12-17 14:45:43 but my gun barely does shit even if it pens
general 2022-12-17 14:46:26 killing 2 crewmen and engine only to get 1shot in return because of shid t6 hull
general 2022-12-17 14:49:45 YOU HAVE A STROKE
general 2022-12-17 14:49:49 THINK FAST OR YOU DIE
general 2022-12-17 14:55:53 does german punch one shot everything in t7-t8
general 2022-12-17 15:19:49 is the qolop good
general 2022-12-17 15:20:06 or should I save for f2 48
general 2022-12-17 15:20:24 but
general 2022-12-17 15:20:27 do I upgrade my hull first
general 2022-12-17 15:20:31 since its a shiddy t6
general 2022-12-17 15:23:54 wtf is this game
general 2022-12-17 15:23:57 3 rear shots no damage
general 2022-12-17 15:24:04 he shoots me from the front I get instakilled
general 2022-12-17 15:24:08 tanmk
general 2022-12-17 15:24:37 dude
general 2022-12-17 15:24:43 I killed his engine and transmission
general 2022-12-17 15:24:47 but they somehow soaked up all the damage
general 2022-12-17 15:25:17 yea but
general 2022-12-17 15:25:20 you'd expect a pen with an APHE
general 2022-12-17 15:25:22 would do more damage
general 2022-12-17 15:25:31 instead of only killing one component especially in the rear
general 2022-12-17 15:26:31 yea I noticed
general 2022-12-17 15:29:22 how much reload
general 2022-12-17 15:29:23 is too much
general 2022-12-17 15:36:30 also
general 2022-12-17 15:36:39 is t72 supposed to have more frontal armour than the abrams
general 2022-12-17 15:38:26 so it looks like t72 has better stats all around than abrams
general 2022-12-17 15:38:32 is abrams just harder to ammorack
general 2022-12-17 15:38:50 for hull
general 2022-12-17 15:38:52 im taking a look
general 2022-12-17 15:39:08 true
general 2022-12-17 15:39:14 yea but less armour
general 2022-12-17 15:39:26 acc and turning speed less
general 2022-12-17 15:39:40 game
general 2022-12-17 15:41:03 whats a good turret for t8
general 2022-12-17 15:41:07 and hull
general 2022-12-17 15:42:42 for t8 what is it
general 2022-12-17 15:43:06 someone said the strv was bad
general 2022-12-17 15:43:10 true?
general 2022-12-17 15:44:59 is amx-50 a good hull
general 2022-12-17 15:45:00 or shid
general 2022-12-17 15:45:38 and what is battlepass 50m meant to be
general 2022-12-17 15:45:47 looks like a king tiger but front part is off
general 2022-12-17 15:48:56 is the turret good too
general 2022-12-17 15:49:06 fat armour but no stabiliser
general 2022-12-17 15:50:35 seems like chieftan turret with KT body would be better
general 2022-12-17 15:52:12 30mm of frontal armour is this right
general 2022-12-17 15:52:13 for what's basically a king tiger
general 2022-12-17 15:52:59 i dont play wt so can you tell me what spaced armour is good against
general 2022-12-17 15:53:24 ok barely anyone uses those
general 2022-12-17 15:54:13 will it stop apfsds
general 2022-12-17 15:54:25 or apds
general 2022-12-17 15:55:05 ok is a fatter slab of metal better against sabots than two slabs of metal that are thinner
general 2022-12-17 15:57:00 ok so only better against HE and APHE
general 2022-12-17 15:58:04 one sec
general 2022-12-17 15:58:20 external 75mm internal 90mm
general 2022-12-17 15:58:33 angled
general 2022-12-17 16:04:16 ok so for my desired setup is KT hull, chieftan turret and F2 gun good
general 2022-12-17 16:04:41 then when I hit that I start grinding out t72 set to enter the turret toss comp
general 2022-12-17 16:15:09 plain craz 2
general 2022-12-17 16:20:46 statue of liberty 🥵
general 2022-12-17 16:20:56 she kinda bad
general 2022-12-18 08:49:49 is this not a pen
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 08:53:07 yea i've seen that before
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 08:53:10 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 08:53:44 are you good at tanmk

general 2022-12-18 09:02:52 why does it react like that
general 2022-12-18 09:02:58 I penned and the HE went off on the inside
general 2022-12-18 09:03:07 it shouldve cooked everything inside that vehicle
general 2022-12-18 09:04:31 reminds me
general 2022-12-18 09:04:48 last round I had multiple shells phase through a guy's fat turret
general 2022-12-18 09:07:03 did this just pen him, bounce off the engine and pen on its way out
general 2022-12-18 09:07:20 this game is wack
general 2022-12-18 09:09:16 shot him a second time in the rear and his transmission has more armour than the hull???
general 2022-12-18 09:09:17 wtf

plane-crazy 2022-12-18 13:15:20 he forgot that plane crazy 2 wasn't supposed to be a roblox highschool game so he had to delete most of his progress
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 13:15:35 this means he has no time to work on winter update because he forgor 💀
general 2022-12-19 03:32:05 whats a good tier 9 hull
general 2022-12-19 03:32:15 is t72 worth?
general 2022-12-19 03:32:35 I heard t72 was badly protected though
general 2022-12-19 03:32:38 or is that the tier 10 variant
general 2022-12-19 03:33:06 12mil

general 2022-12-20 12:23:07 are you mentally ill
general 2022-12-20 12:23:09 you're either gay or straight
general 2022-12-20 12:23:20 you dont just decide "oh I slightly like men"
general 2022-12-20 12:23:29 that makes you bi

general 2022-12-20 12:25:58 define gay rn
general 2022-12-20 12:26:18 being gay by definition is men liking men
general 2022-12-20 12:26:30 a man liking a woman, even if a bit masculine, isnt gay
general 2022-12-20 12:27:36 dont bully bubb hes cool
general 2022-12-20 12:27:53 based guy
general 2022-12-20 12:28:42 wasnt ur point that you can be slightly gay
general 2022-12-20 12:28:46 where did imperialism come from lo

general 2022-12-20 12:31:08 idk you're the only one saying this though
general 2022-12-20 12:31:13 what did he do to you
general 2022-12-20 12:31:23 true
general 2022-12-20 12:34:26 yea saying you can be slightly gay is a horrible offense against the dictionary
general 2022-12-20 12:35:36 you just repeated what I said
general 2022-12-20 12:36:55 <@695324920565071877> pls listen
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:38:02 yeah wtf is up with your "tracks"
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:38:23 rear looks incredibly messed up
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:38:25 front looks bland
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:39:30 ok if thats an old build pls restart it
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:39:58 also if those disconnectors are supposed to be ERA they are very off
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:40:14 why would they be that thick relative to the tank, and why would they be spaced out that much
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:42:13 do you see the huge discrepancy between the thickness
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:42:25 here it goes from normal size to a bit larger, to normal size
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:42:32 on your build it goes from normal size to chonker
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:42:58 still thick af
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:43:10 because of the cylinder's size it looks more out of place
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:44:05 and why is the front sprocket welded to the tank and painted gray
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 12:59:58 too thin then
general 2022-12-20 14:16:24 <@411104247766056960> is challenger 1 turret good for T9
general 2022-12-20 14:16:38 is anything better
general 2022-12-20 14:16:51 no for turret
general 2022-12-20 14:16:57 I already have type 90 huill
general 2022-12-20 14:19:39 is anything better
general 2022-12-20 14:19:50 what about export

general 2022-12-27 11:23:16 are you using a mac
general 2022-12-27 11:26:21 true

general 2022-12-27 11:28:06 usd yea?
general 2022-12-27 11:28:39 also whats ur cpu
general 2022-12-27 11:28:45 so to make sure its not bottlenecking new gpu
general 2022-12-27 11:30:01 ok so your pc is basically a smartfridge
general 2022-12-27 11:30:36 but instead of being a fridge
general 2022-12-27 11:30:42 you can turn it into a smartmicrowave if you remove the fans
general 2022-12-27 11:32:16 lol
general 2022-12-27 11:33:38 fr though I think you might be bottlenecking any gpu upgrade cos this processor is ass
general 2022-12-27 11:35:23 for a glorified fireplace
general 2022-12-27 11:36:28 are you really a gamer if you're not running one of these

general 2022-12-27 11:43:12 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-12-27 11:56:25 <@1047328663969992745> where I live you can get an rx6500XT for the same price as that 1050ti
general 2022-12-27 11:56:35 so just check for that gpu too cos its better than the shid 1050
general 2022-12-27 11:57:39 another option is 1060-6gb
general 2022-12-27 11:57:57 if you can get for under 200cad its also a good option
general 2022-12-27 12:00:04 facebook marketplace is good way to get a dead gpu

general 2022-12-27 12:14:20 since when was I roasting you
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:18:54 not rlly. none of the aspects blend and dont really try to do anything. no pattern, no dazzle, no silhouette breaking. its just a mishmash of random  tones.
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:21:41 most if not all, go search for examples and you’ll know what im talking about.
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:26:03 theyre literally called digital camoflauge patterns. diff camo families exist and they share the same or similar pattern.
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:42:52 with different textures, and a lack of shapes besides the square…not at this stage no. digital camo on a 4x3 surface is also difficult to replicate because it just looks more like random giant blocks of colour than a pixelated camo pattern so you might need a bigger sample to test things out on
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:44:57 if you're not going to read what I said what point do I have trying to help you

general 2022-12-28 05:10:05 why do you hate christians when not all of them are radical fundamentalists
general 2022-12-28 05:10:21 in the same vein, some muslims are radical fundamentalists but not all of them are terrorists
general 2022-12-28 05:10:23 so why do you hate christians
general 2022-12-28 05:11:16 problem is christianity can be divided into many different denominations

general 2022-12-28 05:12:01 i mean
general 2022-12-28 05:12:04 its justified if theyre mormon
general 2022-12-28 05:12:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-28 05:12:47 mormonism isnt even christianity
general 2022-12-28 05:12:51 it wears it like a brand
general 2022-12-28 05:12:53 but its a cult
general 2022-12-28 05:13:24 thats more likely to be jehovas witnesses
general 2022-12-28 05:13:36 if you dont accept the trinity, which is fundamental christian doctrine
general 2022-12-28 05:13:39 you arent a christian
general 2022-12-28 05:14:29 scientology is even worse in regards to selling religion

general 2022-12-28 15:29:36 we did the math like 2 weeks ago
general 2022-12-28 15:29:57 but its not exact
general 2022-12-28 15:30:01 1 is just an approximation
general 2022-12-28 15:30:57 depends on ur scale
general 2022-12-28 15:31:04 if your scale is 2:1
general 2022-12-28 15:31:14 then you do 2 studs/sec per km/h
general 2022-12-28 15:31:31 idk
general 2022-12-28 15:32:02 if you are going to make it as realistic
general 2022-12-28 15:32:08 it should break down within 20 seconds
general 2022-12-28 15:32:51 not much u can do
general 2022-12-28 15:33:00 but I noticed it tends to do that more when its under higher load
general 2022-12-28 15:33:26 and when ur rotate locking
general 2022-12-28 15:33:44 make sure you dont release your keybind midway through so it doesnt rubberband

general 2022-12-29 15:01:34 has rickje spoken much about the weapon reworks
general 2022-12-29 15:01:42 because rockets and fireworks suck ass
general 2022-12-29 15:02:22 not necessarily
general 2022-12-29 15:03:09 for all we know a huge chunk of the map isnt even done because rick hasnt decided what to do with the railway
general 2022-12-29 15:03:52 it is
general 2022-12-29 15:05:43 that reminds me
general 2022-12-29 15:05:49 I hope rickje fixes suspension for pc2

general 2022-12-30 10:25:23 shader for downvotes
general 2022-12-30 10:25:51 a lot of people use shaders to hide bad aspects of their build
general 2022-12-30 10:25:58 so if it looks too unnatural i just downvote
general 2022-12-30 10:26:03 dont care if you spent 2 months on it
general 2022-12-30 10:26:47 everything becomes a mirror
general 2022-12-30 10:27:13 exposed motorlock
general 2022-12-30 10:28:05 why the graphics so bad
general 2022-12-30 10:28:27 no is like his anti aliasing is zero
general 2022-12-30 10:28:29 for the first image
general 2022-12-30 10:32:02 im just waiting for pc2 at this point
general 2022-12-30 10:32:26 the new stuff i've been trying to build literally dont work because plane crazy is buggy shit rn
general 2022-12-30 10:33:04 yes
general 2022-12-30 10:33:34 with one of my builds the broken af pistons used to crash my game when they flung me so hard into the void
general 2022-12-30 10:33:42 literally gamebreaking
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:47:19 but you're talking about vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:48:07 your example isnt a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:48:25 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:48:39 how do you attach the death star to something
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:49:16 not a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:49:28 but you used it as an example to say star wars vehicles are boring
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:49:44 do I have to repeat myself a third time
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:50:56 its a space station
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:51:26 yea, which it isnt
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:52:43 the whole shtick of the death star is an entire military installation built around a planet killing laser
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:53:00 so bluebeam isnt right to call it a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:53:37 only if you want one
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:54:30 easy technique
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:54:56 
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:54:57 torso is longer
general 2022-12-30 12:01:12 hi how old are you
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:04:01 is that a hill you want to die on
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:04:06 because people will laugh at you for calling the iss a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:04:50 from implied context
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:04:55 diels didnt call the iss a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:05:16 yea I think we have a misunderstanding
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:05:18 its ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:36:17 whats wrong with logic gates in pc
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:36:21 you can always just not use them
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:37:40 idk bro, people doing mechanical stuff here already
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:38:25 why
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:38:45 it doesnt even have to be as complicated as minecraft redstone
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:38:53 a toddler can understand it and make their build go from 20 keybinds to only 3
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:39:23 basic level redstone no
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:39:41 but if you call it uncomplicated either you're a high IQ genius or you don't understand the full length of redstone
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:41:48 or I think basic logic should just be integrated into configurations for stuff such as motors
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:42:15 e.g motor A's keybinds cannot be engaged unless motor B's keybind has been engaged
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:42:36 just have the system we have now
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:42:44 and have the logic stuff in an advanced configuration tab
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:43:33 if you can understand motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:43:43 you can understand basic logic
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:45:14 with some mechanical stuff you actually have to be smart
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:45:31 unless you copied off yt tutorials, designing your own gearboxes and swashplates takes brainpower
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:46:41 no I just used that as an example of when plane crazy requires IQ
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:47:15 swashplates fundamentally wont need logic
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:47:39 you have to for this
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:49:11 the device is mechanical by nature
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:49:26 only logic wont cut it
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:53:47 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:53:53 why not build the ISS
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:54:34 how can we help you if you dont give us images or videos
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:57:51 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:59:10 can you make sure your motor and hover pad configs are the same
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:00:42 are the motors rotating in the appropriate direction
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:00:55 cos if one is the opposite way that's what'll cause the instability
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:05:20 try unlocking them
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:05:37 cos locked motors tend to be unreliable when powered
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:06:16 yeah you need full torque to counter the drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:06:39 we'll see
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:07:00 br
general 2022-12-30 13:09:27 the acs gun system is the shittest attempt at a tactical fps
general 2022-12-30 13:10:04 it sucks ass
general 2022-12-30 13:10:48 theyre all built on the same system which is fundamentally garbage
general 2022-12-30 13:11:14 the movement feels and appears really bad
general 2022-12-30 13:11:26 controls often unresponsive because the acs system tends to cause servers to lag
general 2022-12-30 13:11:29 medical system is overly convoluted and so cheese by design
general 2022-12-30 13:12:01 the gunplay itself just feels very off
general 2022-12-30 13:12:09 there is no flow to it whatsoever
general 2022-12-30 13:12:21 its just pure jank
general 2022-12-30 13:13:19 ACS
general 2022-12-30 13:13:36 so-called 'advanced' combat system
general 2022-12-30 13:13:40 only advanced at being shit
general 2022-12-30 13:13:58 its basically a free model script that lazy devs use because they cant code an integral part of their own FPS game
general 2022-12-30 13:15:38 and to top it off theres no player customisation at all in terms of gunplay
general 2022-12-30 13:16:12 you cant set your own FOV, sensitivity (doesnt save between guns) and keybinds
general 2022-12-30 13:16:20 its just the same copy and paste shit
general 2022-12-30 13:18:35 it tries so hard to be this overt tacticool gun system but you cant even zero your sights and magazines are drawn from a magical ammunition pool in your back pocket as if it's classic COD or BF
general 2022-12-30 13:19:24 in a lot of the games the sights dont even line up properly lol
general 2022-12-30 13:21:31 should be renamed to ass combat system instead
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:39:32 vtol mechanisms take up space in an aircraft and are dead weight once they're actually flying
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:39:39 reduces operational range by several hundred km
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:39:49 operational range is actually important logistically and in war
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:40:36 the thing is
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:41:29 the extra infrastructure is definitely beneficial because it also reduces the extra fuel costs that come with vtols
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:41:34 fuel is a treasured commodity in wartime
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:42:11 proof is the germans in ww2, or the russians in ukraine right now
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:43:33 so what
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:43:50 if an airport is small it wont even be able to support a large vtol squadron anyway
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:43:56 vtols require more maintanence
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:44:05 thus more staff, parts, money, fuel etc.
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:44:37 why have a few vtols when you can have more standard jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:44:50 all running with more efficiency and operational range
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:18:45 densest material known is a whitename's skull
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:19:18 dont be a whitename
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:19:32 you have an expert rank
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:19:35 yet choose white out of all colours
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:19:41 that means you are voluntarily dumb
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:21:18 the winter stuff doesnt require any work
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:21:21 cos it's already done
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:21:32 he just reuses the same winter event every time

general 2023-01-02 09:27:56 nah
general 2023-01-02 09:28:00 he killed someone else before he killed me
general 2023-01-02 09:28:22 he shoots me, kills another guy, kills me
general 2023-01-02 09:29:32 and this isnt a one off again
general 2023-01-02 09:29:48 beforehand he spammed smokes and killed 3 of my teammates through it while we couldnt see them
general 2023-01-02 09:30:01 but I didnt rec that cos I just thought that was insane luck
general 2023-01-02 09:32:13 or prob shaders to remove smoke
general 2023-01-02 09:32:15 still cheating
general 2023-01-02 09:34:02 problem is
general 2023-01-02 09:34:07 I started reversing after smoke was deployed
general 2023-01-02 09:34:13 so if he was predicting he wouldve shot where I was staying
general 2023-01-02 09:35:00 ok what I mean is
general 2023-01-02 09:35:11 he wouldnt have seen the end of my reverse
general 2023-01-02 09:36:43 i wasnt reversing at consistent angle he saw me
general 2023-01-02 09:37:52 so for all he could tell I went through the opening to the left
general 2023-01-02 09:38:28 and its a lot harder to predict

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 12:56:59 so you know how helium makes stuff go up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 12:57:12 let me do ms paint diagram
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 12:59:42 say you put helium at the right side, it'll be unbalanced because force is only applied at the right side
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 13:01:06 if you apply at center the force up will be from the middle
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 13:01:11 so in the end this block wont spinny spin cos its balanced

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 13:18:44 not helium in general
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 13:26:46 because add to center has a specific usecase

general 2023-01-03 15:31:12 This server has done nothing but bring me down as a person. everyday i come in here and all you do is tear me down insult me hurt me with your words and do nothing but harm me emotionally physically mentally and I just can’t take it any longer this server is so abusive and toxic it’s crazy. no one even realizes how disgusting all of your behaviors are. every single time I talk or type or even do anything or interact with anyone in the server everybody just goes against me and gangs up on me like a pack of wolves and just attacks me and i didn’t do anything to deserve these attacks and these hurtful words. i literally just try to be nice to everybody but nobody ever wants to be in my shoes and nobody ever tries to sympathize with me and see where I’m coming from all of you just see me as the enemy and as the bad guy that’s trying to ruin the server or something when really I’m just trying to spread positivity. you guys act like I’m some kind of virus or disease, constantly casting me out so much, making me feel so left out and so alone in this server. it’s fucking driving me insane I feel mental and I feel like a weirdo just being around all of you because of how you treat me. at this point in time, I’ve given up on ever trying again and ever becoming any of your friends because I just know your feelings towards me clearly. i know all of you hate me and never want to be around me again or never have anything to do with me. it’s clear that you all think I’m a joke and that I’m stupid, idiotic and boring. it’s so mean because I literally don’t do anything to you guys but you guys always act like you hate me and it makes me feel so confused because I don’t know what I did to deserve it. I feel like I should just leave because clearly nobody wants to be around me and everyone would be happier if i left anyways so i’ll just go and i hope all of you find happiness in life and i’m sorry for all the troubles i’ve ever put any of you through. i give up. goodbye.

general 2023-01-11 01:17:36 but pc2 will still be using the grid system
general 2023-01-11 01:17:44 how will you custom angle a 1x1 block
general 2023-01-11 01:21:44 yeah so you still need motorlock
general 2023-01-11 01:21:50 not like angle locking is obsolete
general 2023-01-11 01:22:14 i dont think so for as long as plane crazy retains the current grid system
general 2023-01-11 01:30:10 does anyone know how to make motor return to original position when its toggled off
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:31:47 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:32:11 wings should be half block or less
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:32:31 cockpit glass has no detail
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:32:42 wing pattern is very wack
general 2023-01-11 01:34:51 when your server is more strict than pcc
general 2023-01-11 01:35:00 you have to rethink your moderation
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:36:49 false
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:37:09 you can angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:37:34 and if need be discard the tower with magnet or offset lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:38:56 idk looks like a full block
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:39:01 but either way still seems too thick
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:39:32 because these are like paper compared to your wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:39:46 and as you can tell
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:39:51 the wing pattern is indeed wacck
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:40:15 like why are they rounded off in yours
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:40:41 what I wouldve done is made the wing black instead
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:40:51 and anglelocked trails for the grey part
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:41:10 TIE fighter is a very bad build to try make if you don't know how to angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:41:49 its when you can angle a block however you want
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:41:58 so you can make a 1x10 wedge if you want
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:42:14 its just a more advanced form of motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:42:20 theres plenty of yt tutorials out there for it
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:42:29 this thing isnt complicated compared to some other motorlock concepts
general 2023-01-11 01:47:56 doesnt work
general 2023-01-11 01:48:00 cos I want it to reset when it toggles off
general 2023-01-11 01:48:20 that means the motor will be disabled
general 2023-01-11 01:48:29 am scifarded
general 2023-01-11 01:53:00 no because I want the motor to keep rotating
general 2023-01-11 01:53:09 then only return to original position when disabled
general 2023-01-11 01:55:12 why is the reset motor so shit

seems like it happens when you place a block a split second before your build loads in. becomes undeletable when it occupies the same position as another block of the loaded build

general 2023-01-11 06:31:15 is there a way to make a reset motor work with toggle

general 2023-01-11 07:17:11 resets when disabled
general 2023-01-11 07:18:05 and make max angle optional

plane-crazy 2023-01-11 12:34:02 leaving behind the good stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 12:34:05 therefore no exposed lock

general 2023-01-11 23:41:38 and motor1
general 2023-01-11 23:41:39 so shit
general 2023-01-12 00:37:21 yes
general 2023-01-12 00:39:38 so I have 2 basically identical mechanisms
general 2023-01-12 00:39:42 in one of them the motor2 spazzes out
general 2023-01-12 00:39:46 in the other the motor2 is fine
general 2023-01-12 00:39:56 this is plane crazy
general 2023-01-12 00:43:22 i wish rickje did a hotfix for motors
general 2023-01-12 00:43:32 since 1000 torque is more like 0

general 2023-01-12 00:50:45 lol they dont care about hof anymore
general 2023-01-12 00:51:41 how
general 2023-01-12 00:51:51 isnt it same as the one before it
general 2023-01-12 00:51:59 the winter update
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 00:56:50 mp3 file
general 2023-01-12 00:58:03 so is anybody going to answer how the last winter update broke stuff when winter update has always been the same
general 2023-01-12 00:59:41 ok guess we're sticking with the lazy 'hardcoded' answer
general 2023-01-12 00:59:46 even though thats not new to anyone
general 2023-01-12 01:00:08 the winter update is the same
general 2023-01-12 01:00:13 rick had to have done something else
general 2023-01-12 01:00:49 lol
general 2023-01-12 01:01:08 he says "pc2 coming soon" then vanishes for a few months
general 2023-01-12 01:03:43 we must bribe madattak into coming back
general 2023-01-12 01:04:04 i think
general 2023-01-12 01:04:27 it’ll be good if we get a bit more sneak peeks for pc2
general 2023-01-12 01:05:02 yea who cares about tunnel

general 2023-01-12 01:06:42 dont think so
general 2023-01-12 01:07:08 theres no way hes lone rn considering that there were definitely applicants for a pc2 dev
general 2023-01-12 01:07:40 what else
general 2023-01-12 01:07:44 he has to hire
general 2023-01-12 01:07:52 he cant just make devs work for free lol
general 2023-01-12 01:08:12 because at the end of the day ro dev is still work
general 2023-01-12 01:09:37 even harder to find a competent dev who would devote decent time
general 2023-01-12 01:09:58 bad idea tbh

general 2023-01-13 09:32:20 feelsbadman
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 09:33:25 why is physics in this game so shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 09:34:01 anchored build with physics enabled and one motor2 causes it to keep teleporting off the plot
the-dump 2023-01-13 09:36:43 kid looks older than average pcc member
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 09:46:14 and
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 09:46:38 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 09:46:47 how far are you to finishing
general 2023-01-13 09:49:39 which deathstar
general 2023-01-13 09:50:11 so real
general 2023-01-13 09:50:44 is death star allowed to blow up earth or not
general 2023-01-13 09:51:02 cos its autowin for deathstar if yes
general 2023-01-13 09:51:45 yes it does
general 2023-01-13 09:51:49 it did it with alderaan
general 2023-01-13 09:51:56 which is same size as earth
general 2023-01-13 09:52:23 deathstar can also just not go near earth
general 2023-01-13 09:52:38 blow up a different planet of the solar system and destabilise the orbits enough to fuck everyone on the planet
general 2023-01-13 09:53:24 idk much about ace combat
general 2023-01-13 09:53:33 hows their infantry
general 2023-01-13 09:53:49 th
general 2023-01-13 09:54:02 tie fighters probably cooked
general 2023-01-13 09:54:30 7-9k tie fighters, bulk of which are the shitty default ones
general 2023-01-13 09:54:56 yea
general 2023-01-13 09:55:04 and I assume ace combat universe outnumbers the tie fighters right
general 2023-01-13 09:55:22 7-9k
general 2023-01-13 09:55:52 wait
general 2023-01-13 09:55:56 is this in general or just on the death star
general 2023-01-13 09:56:10 so is it full empire
general 2023-01-13 09:56:12 vs strangereal
general 2023-01-13 09:56:16 ok earth fucked too
general 2023-01-13 09:56:23 i dont think they can take on 20k star destroyers lol
general 2023-01-13 09:56:36 mayb
general 2023-01-13 09:57:15 a small battlegroup was enough to melt a planet's crust
general 2023-01-13 09:57:34 idk star wars always contradicts itself
general 2023-01-13 09:57:45 they can withstand tsunami causing barrages
general 2023-01-13 09:57:53 but die to a single A-wing crashing into the bridge
general 2023-01-13 09:58:17 how many stone henge
general 2023-01-13 09:58:46 so is ground warfare completely obsolete
general 2023-01-13 09:59:37 cos the problem with whole empire vs ace combat earth
general 2023-01-13 09:59:42 is they can just keep throwing bodies at them nonstop
general 2023-01-13 10:00:03 i dont think its fair
general 2023-01-13 10:00:10 cos they have a galaxy worth of industrial production
general 2023-01-13 10:00:11 and manpower
general 2023-01-13 10:00:58 idk
general 2023-01-13 10:01:30 they dont
general 2023-01-13 10:01:48 point defense exists too
general 2023-01-13 10:02:05 granted its pretty shitty in star wars
general 2023-01-13 10:02:08 but I think they have a chance
general 2023-01-13 10:03:29 wtf
general 2023-01-13 10:03:29 on itself
general 2023-01-13 10:03:55 they predicted war in ukraine 2023?
general 2023-01-13 10:05:06 ok with nukes
general 2023-01-13 10:05:19 I think star destroyers could handle them if they can handle endless barrages of turbolasers
general 2023-01-13 10:05:28 because the shields are designed more for energy weapons
general 2023-01-13 10:06:21 what
general 2023-01-13 10:06:28 is that like the ODP array in halo
general 2023-01-13 10:07:41 yea
general 2023-01-13 10:08:26 so real
general 2023-01-13 10:14:27 ok so where is this heading now

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:02:53 or
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:02:57 you shouldve done the road wheels first
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:03:01 then angle the treads around them
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:05:31 looks like someone pissed on your screen
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:09:33 if swimming through a pool of piss is your thing, then im not judging

general 2023-01-14 14:14:10 downvoting
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:14:47 angle lock trail mayb
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:15:19 not worth the risk
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:15:23 because shaders are generally fucking ass
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:15:49 yeah but at the cost of downloading some random executor from v3rm
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:15:50 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:16:08 even if no risk
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:16:12 you're just wasting time
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:08 whats the premise of that anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:12 why are astronauts shooting each other
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:30 if you download roshade
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:40 even if there's no risk of virus
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:45 you are mentally disabled
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:17:57 because shaders are generally shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:18:01 and all roshade does is make stuff shiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:18:07 wow so cool much graphics
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:18:33 for what
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:18:38 is this for showcase or <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:18:52 cos if you photoshop or shader stuff in <#384025409945337856> i will 90% of the time downvote
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:19:53 either because the shader itself looks stupid, or people do it because they're hiding bad features
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:17 you're like the only one
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:22 who has acceptable shaders
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:28 literally most of them in creations are stupid
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:47 yea thats why they're better
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:49 they dont go over the top
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:20:58 they dont turn concrete into shiny glass
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:21:12 like what most roshade users tend to love for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:21:42 it just feels like
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:21:45 a cheap way to get a good picture
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:22:12 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:22:17 you can just motorlock two halfs

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 14:29:52 fireworks as your bombs

general 2023-01-14 15:07:56 some pixel art can genuinely be ok
general 2023-01-14 15:08:01 funny ones or high effort
general 2023-01-14 15:08:09 this was neither
general 2023-01-14 15:08:59 shader won't get your pixel art anywhere
general 2023-01-14 15:09:03 where tf did you pull that out of?

general 2023-01-14 15:13:46 lol ok
general 2023-01-14 15:16:04 depends
general 2023-01-14 15:16:10 a lot of esports FPS players tend not to use it
general 2023-01-14 15:16:15 because it leads to inconsistent aim
general 2023-01-14 15:16:25 waltuh
general 2023-01-14 15:16:37 it depends on the game too
general 2023-01-14 15:16:45 cos u can still have good aim with mouse acceleration
general 2023-01-14 15:17:27 if u suck at fps
general 2023-01-14 15:17:32 you need to match your mouse sensitivity the same
general 2023-01-14 15:17:34 across each game
general 2023-01-14 15:18:16 i keep it on
general 2023-01-14 15:19:37 my monitor settings are wack
general 2023-01-14 15:19:43 cos a lot of games in dark settings are pitch black
general 2023-01-14 15:19:48 while people can see I cant see
general 2023-01-14 15:20:59 you don't deserve a clown role or noobrole
general 2023-01-14 15:21:03 not because you're neither of those
general 2023-01-14 15:21:09 but because you are that irrelevant to pcc
general 2023-01-14 15:31:02 cos it stinks
general 2023-01-14 15:31:37 because you don't realise it's smelly
general 2023-01-14 15:31:45 there's a reason a lot of countries ban it on public transport
general 2023-01-14 15:32:11 smells like shit to most people
general 2023-01-14 15:33:24 durian
general 2023-01-14 15:33:28 is ironically stronger smelling than shit
general 2023-01-14 15:34:42 thats not what he means
general 2023-01-14 15:35:24 ok
general 2023-01-14 15:35:35 all because some online people disliked your build
general 2023-01-14 15:35:37 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

general 2023-01-14 15:39:12 🤮
general 2023-01-14 15:39:21 shittest fruit
general 2023-01-14 15:39:42 it offends your sense of smell so badly that it's outlawed on public transport in several countries
general 2023-01-14 15:39:51 you would rather be stuck in a public bathroom with a clogged toilet
general 2023-01-14 15:41:54 its rancid
general 2023-01-14 15:42:14 the smell is so shit
general 2023-01-14 15:42:16 there's no point consuming it
general 2023-01-14 15:42:30 dude
general 2023-01-14 15:42:33 its beyond bitter
general 2023-01-14 15:42:53 there is nothing fresh that smells worse
general 2023-01-14 15:43:08 wdym dark chocolate
general 2023-01-14 15:43:12 that's an insult to dark chocolate
general 2023-01-14 15:43:37 i eat fruit
general 2023-01-14 15:43:45 durian sucks though
general 2023-01-14 15:44:58 because smell and taste heavily relate
general 2023-01-14 15:45:03 you can smell things in your mouth too
general 2023-01-14 15:45:34 this to an extent, since your mouth and nose are connected
general 2023-01-14 15:45:43 and because durian is so shit smelling
general 2023-01-14 15:45:59 it overwhelms whatever taste there's supposed to be anyway
general 2023-01-14 15:46:25 yes
general 2023-01-14 15:46:47 cant get anywhere near it
general 2023-01-14 15:47:00 why would I try it
general 2023-01-14 15:47:03 if it smells like sewage
general 2023-01-14 15:47:36 how would I enjoy an experience of stuffing rot-smelling things in my face
general 2023-01-14 15:48:38 suggestive

general 2023-01-14 16:25:21 us funds are not going to russia at all
general 2023-01-14 16:25:26 why sanction russia and give them things lol
general 2023-01-14 16:25:56 what do you mean aint  doing shit
general 2023-01-14 16:26:00 tens of thousands of ukrainians have died in this war
general 2023-01-14 16:26:11 they are holding at two towns
general 2023-01-14 16:26:14 against a large offensive
general 2023-01-14 16:27:05 you give the ukrainians less credit than they deserve
general 2023-01-14 16:27:12 most estimates believe 100k+ russians have died
general 2023-01-14 16:27:38 there is video footage of ukrainians putting weapons such as NLAWs, HIMARS and M113s to good use
general 2023-01-14 16:28:23 at this stage
general 2023-01-14 16:28:31 more russians have died in ukraine than US soldiers in vietnam
general 2023-01-14 16:28:41 yet you say ukrainians aren't doing shit
general 2023-01-14 16:28:59 it's at a point putin declared 'partial mobilisation'
general 2023-01-14 16:29:04 because he knows he's losing
general 2023-01-14 16:29:11 the US, the UN, the EU
general 2023-01-14 16:29:18 people who aren't directly involved
general 2023-01-14 16:29:56 does it look like there are NATO boots on the ground
general 2023-01-14 16:30:21 yes so
general 2023-01-14 16:30:42 the transfer into poland is posturing
general 2023-01-14 16:30:47 they aren't sending US soldiers into ukraine
general 2023-01-14 16:30:50 that would cause WW3
general 2023-01-14 16:32:12 is it even 100% confirmed if the missile was from ukraine or russia
general 2023-01-14 16:32:29 cos both countries deny it last time I remember
general 2023-01-14 16:33:12 On 17 November, Head of the Polish International Policy Bureau Jakub Kumoch gave a similar explanation that an air defence missile failed to shoot down the Russian target it sought to intercept; then "[t]he self-destruct system did not work, and this missile led to a tragedy."[29]
general 2023-01-14 16:33:12 ok so on wikipedia
general 2023-01-14 16:33:24 so ukraine accident
general 2023-01-14 16:34:19 poland tired of getting shit on
general 2023-01-14 16:34:44 why pissed at ukraine
general 2023-01-14 16:34:49 they're openly accepting ukrainian refugees
general 2023-01-14 16:34:54 and supporting ukraine
general 2023-01-14 16:35:07 they hate russia just as much as ukraine does
general 2023-01-14 16:35:38 1 rocket from a warzone
general 2023-01-14 16:38:06 citizens maybe
general 2023-01-14 16:38:22 but polish government seems to be satisfied with ukraine at the moment
general 2023-01-14 16:39:30 they're ranked second in terms of weapon supply to ukraine
general 2023-01-14 16:39:33 first being the US
general 2023-01-14 16:40:00 there's no obligation to send weapons
general 2023-01-14 16:40:12 yet the polish government still offers military and humanitarian aid
general 2023-01-14 16:40:32 they aren't being forced at nukepoint to give ukraine over a billion in funds
general 2023-01-14 16:40:53 they could've just done the bare minimum and sent helmets to ukraine like the germans did earlier on
general 2023-01-14 16:42:59 every country understands accepting refugees has a cost
general 2023-01-14 16:43:47 you can't just generalise the entire country and say they dislike ukraine because of some refugees causing trouble
general 2023-01-14 16:45:04 im well aware of the ukrainian insurgent army and their bad history with poland
general 2023-01-14 16:45:13 but what's important to remember is that they have a common enemy
general 2023-01-14 16:45:27 it's in poland's best interest to help them
general 2023-01-14 16:45:59 russia lost 2 t72s to a minefield, so what lol
general 2023-01-14 16:46:01 its war
general 2023-01-14 16:46:05 things happen
general 2023-01-14 16:46:26 and this was 3 actually, the last one drove over the same spot KNOWING there were mines there
general 2023-01-14 16:48:43 i think its more embarassing for russia to give ukrainian farmers free t72s
general 2023-01-14 16:48:48 than for ukraine to lose a jet to a drone
general 2023-01-14 16:48:57 so theres that ig
general 2023-01-14 16:49:07 steel titan ass

general 2023-01-14 16:58:33 
general 2023-01-14 16:59:09 vroom vroom
general 2023-01-14 16:59:27 i heard its not that good at killing tanks anymore
general 2023-01-14 16:59:48 but seeing as russia fielded t64 and ladas
general 2023-01-14 16:59:51 i think they'll be fine
general 2023-01-14 17:00:53 if leopard 2 get sent into ukraine
general 2023-01-14 17:01:01 we gonna watch the first NATO tank vs t14 armata battle in history
general 2023-01-14 17:01:19 thats if the t14 doesnt get blown off the face off the earth
general 2023-01-14 17:01:21 or breaks in transport beforehand
general 2023-01-14 17:01:42 idk i dont play wt anymore
general 2023-01-14 17:01:45 too much grind
general 2023-01-14 17:02:40 it'll be funny if it just breaks down while going to battle
general 2023-01-14 17:02:49 just like the germans in ww2
general 2023-01-14 17:03:55 us gotta save the good stuff for themselves
general 2023-01-14 17:04:22 they'll sell it to the farmer army
general 2023-01-14 17:04:24 they'll know what to do
general 2023-01-14 17:04:49 perfect weapon for home defence
general 2023-01-14 17:13:21 concept lol
general 2023-01-14 17:13:37 china only good at showing off
general 2023-01-14 17:17:22 steel titans is so shit
general 2023-01-14 17:17:29 in every facet of the game
general 2023-01-14 17:17:58 dont
general 2023-01-14 17:18:06 garbage
general 2023-01-14 17:18:08 play tanmk instead
general 2023-01-14 17:18:22 armoured patrol has better tank gameplay
general 2023-01-14 17:18:23 than steel titans
general 2023-01-14 17:19:16 steel titans has worse gameplay than the tanki.online webgame from a decade ago
general 2023-01-14 17:19:59 seems so unfinished though
general 2023-01-14 17:20:27 yea but its paid on steam
general 2023-01-14 17:20:28 th
general 2023-01-14 17:20:44 tanmk better
general 2023-01-14 17:20:47 you can't call both mid
general 2023-01-14 17:20:49 when one is clearly shitter
general 2023-01-14 17:21:16 at least you don't get stuck on a pebble like in steel titans
general 2023-01-14 17:23:18 multicrewtank
general 2023-01-14 17:23:30 yes
general 2023-01-14 17:23:31 bully children
general 2023-01-14 17:23:36 armoured patrol same way
general 2023-01-14 17:24:01 its still ok
general 2023-01-14 17:24:11 it was made in a simpler time
general 2023-01-14 17:24:19 still holds up well
general 2023-01-14 17:24:24 dead ahead has stupid teammates though
general 2023-01-14 17:24:50 attrition *was* good
general 2023-01-14 17:24:52 now its mid
general 2023-01-14 17:25:07 but the snowball effect was pretty shit
general 2023-01-14 17:25:10 and it's always been a thing
general 2023-01-14 17:25:21 when a team starts winning theres almost no counterchance for the other team in attrition
general 2023-01-14 17:25:33 because they get rewarded with better means to win harder
general 2023-01-14 17:25:52 yea
general 2023-01-14 17:25:58 lots of braindead team in attrition too
general 2023-01-14 17:26:17 conquerors 3 boring now
general 2023-01-14 17:26:53 its the same gameplay each time

general 2023-01-14 17:29:15 i can never get neo warfare to load
general 2023-01-14 17:29:37 yea but there's a problem when a roblox game loads slower than squad
general 2023-01-14 17:30:41 idk bro its wack
general 2023-01-14 17:31:29 roblox has the shittest servers known to man

general 2023-01-14 17:32:21 yeah because
general 2023-01-14 17:32:23 roblox is shit

general 2023-01-14 17:33:42 yeah roblox has this weirdass thing
general 2023-01-14 17:33:46 where I just randomly spike to 400-500
general 2023-01-14 17:33:52 never happens in any other game
general 2023-01-14 17:34:08 nah
general 2023-01-14 17:34:15 they're trying to target the older audience now
general 2023-01-14 17:34:23 but failing horribly
general 2023-01-14 17:34:50 at least under 13s cant play age restricted games now
general 2023-01-14 17:34:59 so playerbase somewhat better

general 2023-01-17 03:36:50 hmmm
general 2023-01-17 03:37:27 camera lock is a cheaper angle lock that doesnt save
general 2023-01-17 03:37:30 explain to me how it's better
general 2023-01-17 03:37:34 💀
general 2023-01-17 03:37:53 ^
general 2023-01-17 03:38:18 how much fps are you going to lose
general 2023-01-17 03:38:19 1?
general 2023-01-17 03:38:21 lol
general 2023-01-17 03:38:41 why you playing on an apple watch
general 2023-01-17 03:39:24 angle lock doesnt add much blocks to be noticeable
general 2023-01-17 03:39:33 if you say lag has an impact either you are dumb or have pc from 2010
general 2023-01-17 03:40:21 angle lock is one rotation motor and a couple text blocks/cameras
general 2023-01-17 03:40:23 how will that make you lag
general 2023-01-17 03:40:44 jesse
general 2023-01-17 03:40:49 what the hell are you talking about
general 2023-01-17 03:42:36 if u replace those locked angling motors with cameras u wont get much better results
general 2023-01-17 03:43:25 my 4k block angle locked stug can fly at 60fps
general 2023-01-17 03:43:30 no throttling

general 2023-01-17 04:06:49 is there any good teamwork games on roblox
general 2023-01-17 04:07:01 something good to play with friends
general 2023-01-17 04:07:24 attrition dead now
general 2023-01-17 04:07:59 I miss the simple days of tunneling under the hill and using the grenade launcher to kill everyone on the cap
general 2023-01-17 04:08:31 yeah but shovel sucks ass now
general 2023-01-17 04:09:00 technically
general 2023-01-17 04:09:15 but the mechanics of using it are different
general 2023-01-17 04:09:33 pain in the butt to use now
general 2023-01-17 04:09:34 too many buttons
general 2023-01-17 04:09:58 that always existed
general 2023-01-17 04:10:19 nah
general 2023-01-17 04:10:35 snowballing still a thing in attrition
general 2023-01-17 04:10:38 thats bad too
general 2023-01-17 04:11:53 attrition was always just
general 2023-01-17 04:11:56 which team can rush heli first
general 2023-01-17 04:12:14 when one team wins they start winning harder
general 2023-01-17 04:12:27 so other team ends up getting slaughtered
general 2023-01-17 04:12:32 no counter chance
general 2023-01-17 04:12:42 because of attrition point system
general 2023-01-17 04:12:53 when you get high points
general 2023-01-17 04:12:57 you buy stuff to get more points
general 2023-01-17 04:13:08 then other team fuked cos they cant deal with 3 helis at once
general 2023-01-17 04:13:22 while they still all have jeeps and mid ground vehicles
general 2023-01-17 04:13:30 wow
general 2023-01-17 04:13:34 unreal
general 2023-01-17 04:13:52 aa jeep used to be pretty mid
general 2023-01-17 04:13:55 idk how it is now
general 2023-01-17 04:14:18 a10 wortog
general 2023-01-17 04:15:31 i think early-mid game attrition matches are funnest
general 2023-01-17 04:15:38 because by lategame vehicle spam everywhere
general 2023-01-17 04:15:41 and everything just craters
general 2023-01-17 04:15:51 infantry becomes irrelevant
general 2023-01-17 04:16:28 ngl
general 2023-01-17 04:16:28 the tunnel meta was a bit dumb
general 2023-01-17 04:16:43 because you could always see other tunnels with shiftlock
general 2023-01-17 04:17:09 because of tunneling
general 2023-01-17 04:17:15 some dumb teammates thought it was a good idea to dig a giant crater into the point
general 2023-01-17 04:17:38 which in fact made it harder to defend the point cos they had 5iq
general 2023-01-17 04:18:19 lame
general 2023-01-17 04:23:13 attrition no players rn

help 2023-01-22 11:35:47 shotguns being inaccurate is a video game concept

help 2023-01-22 11:38:21 show your design
help 2023-01-22 11:38:57 whats a classic 3x3 magnet cannon
help 2023-01-22 11:39:11 just screenshot it
help 2023-01-22 12:14:50 why are all your magnets at the back
help 2023-01-22 12:15:08 acceleration isnt uniform with all the cutters
help 2023-01-22 12:15:59 you need magnets along the barrel placed evenly
help 2023-01-22 12:16:43 so what if it has enough range for all the cutters
help 2023-01-22 12:17:00 nope
help 2023-01-22 12:18:25 yes
help 2023-01-22 12:18:30 because magnets apply more force the closer an object is
help 2023-01-22 12:19:00 no
help 2023-01-22 12:19:17 not if your barrel is longer
help 2023-01-22 12:19:21 and you can add a choke
help 2023-01-22 12:20:42 yes
help 2023-01-22 12:20:44 almost
help 2023-01-22 12:24:35 I can explain further
help 2023-01-22 12:24:54 magnets are identical in range and strength, but on the left the red ball is further away
help 2023-01-22 12:25:35 now the reason why the magnet launches the red ball at a lower velocity is because there is less distance for the magnet to act upon the red ball
help 2023-01-22 12:25:53 therefore, the cutters at the back accelerate faster than the cutters at the front
help 2023-01-22 12:26:12 because it's not uniform the cutters in the back actually disrupt the structure of your projectiles and cause inaccuracy
help 2023-01-22 12:29:26 javit do you know how to design a choke too
help 2023-01-22 12:29:29 so you can lower the spread
help 2023-01-22 12:31:57 nah fuck tutorials

help 2023-01-22 12:33:34 unless im missing something
help 2023-01-22 12:33:52 and this wont really help you
help 2023-01-22 12:35:23 I guess you can motorlock the magnets into position
help 2023-01-22 12:35:32 or just place them outside
help 2023-01-22 12:36:28 idk I always used superstrength
help 2023-01-22 12:44:30 slow them down
help 2023-01-22 12:44:55 or from the back to front, go lower strength to higher strength
help 2023-01-22 12:48:47 you contribute nothing of use here
help 2023-01-22 13:00:53 perhaps thats why you're useless then

plane-crazy 2023-01-23 13:57:32 so cant say he's jealous
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 13:59:36 nah I think its the opposite
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:00:09 ruru couldve definitely added more detail instead of just using a sign
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:00:37 not saying its bad but the oversimplification of some detailing mightve been why he downvoted
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:00:59 and look at the driver's vision port
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:01:01 compared to rurus
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:01:24 the turret is excusable though cos obviously custom
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:02:05 not always
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 14:02:46 so how does this relate

general 2023-01-24 12:32:40 but bad idea when explosives being used
general 2023-01-24 12:32:45 cos u risk having every single unit wiped in 2 secs
general 2023-01-24 12:33:13 soviets have a charge ability for their conscript units
general 2023-01-24 12:34:19 bad idea

general 2023-01-24 12:59:50 then ragequit
general 2023-01-24 13:00:14 most
general 2023-01-24 13:00:22 but they get more per squad
general 2023-01-24 13:00:24 6 per squad
general 2023-01-24 13:00:26 while germans 4-5
general 2023-01-24 13:00:45 germans get mg42 lmgs though
general 2023-01-24 13:00:58 the western counterparts get stg44s
general 2023-01-24 13:01:10 doesnt have suppression effect
general 2023-01-24 13:01:13 but it does decent damage
general 2023-01-24 13:01:20 can make light vehicles fuck off

general 2023-01-24 13:03:01 <@695983848575598664> if the chinese ragequit again I will play as german west high command
general 2023-01-24 13:03:08 but british is hard counter
general 2023-01-24 13:03:09 😭
general 2023-01-24 13:03:23 everything the british have
general 2023-01-24 13:03:27 will stomp western front germany
general 2023-01-24 13:03:47 because western front germany was op
general 2023-01-24 13:03:52 there's SS troops in the game
general 2023-01-24 13:03:57 so the devs nerfed it so hard
general 2023-01-24 13:04:02 yea
general 2023-01-24 13:04:09 what
general 2023-01-24 13:04:54 western front is more specialised troops, weaker in early and midgame but stronger lategame
general 2023-01-24 13:05:24 kind of
general 2023-01-24 13:05:29 east germany still pretty strong
general 2023-01-24 13:05:34 but doesnt have scaling as good as western front
general 2023-01-24 13:05:49 dealing with early game light vehicles
general 2023-01-24 13:06:01 and gets trash mg34
general 2023-01-24 13:06:07 while east gets mg42
general 2023-01-24 13:06:33 but vehicle crews can attain better veterancy ranks
general 2023-01-24 13:06:34 yes
general 2023-01-24 13:06:55 so if your squads are more successful they will get veteran ranks
general 2023-01-24 13:07:00 every faction is max of 3 stars
general 2023-01-24 13:07:04 west german is 5
general 2023-01-24 13:07:16 yea mainline troops
general 2023-01-24 13:07:24 they have special stuff accessible from commanders
general 2023-01-24 13:08:05 american is strong infantry focus
general 2023-01-24 13:08:10 cos their tanks are pretty bad
general 2023-01-24 13:08:16 unless they spam jackson tank destroyers or something
general 2023-01-24 13:08:29 leave me alone mate

general 2023-01-24 13:10:57 which nukes everything you have
general 2023-01-24 13:11:07 then they can instant repair with smoke cover from artillery
general 2023-01-24 13:11:27 if that wasnt bad enough they can spam emplacements and build a whole city
general 2023-01-24 13:11:30 very
general 2023-01-24 13:11:45 sort of

plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:40:45 you're treating this like it's an illuminati superweapon
general 2023-01-26 11:42:07 💥
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:43:14 lol how does an arrangement of plane crazy blocks modify roblox’s coding
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:43:21 impossible
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:44:58 what are these entity block junctions
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:05 right now that’s meaningless
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:36 so breaking weld somehow changes roblox code?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:39 wtf
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:46:39 and how would someone know what they’re doing
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:08 how is roblox code changeable through abuse of the physics system
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:13 filtering enabled doesnt allow that
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:19 only clientside
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:45 what part is changeable exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:49:27 idk dude
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:49:39 anyone with basic development knowledge would understandably believe its bull
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:51:19 and where did you learn this
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:51:44 depends on what it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:52:09 what implications does it have for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:23 dont know them <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:57:17 ok so core tech appears to make physics wack
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:06 as an inject wtf?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:16 full on exploiting?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:42 so you dont even need the injector
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:59:11 who is ‘we’
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:02:40 you’ve already opened pandora’s box, how will describing what you do with core tech be more damaging than the core tech itself
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:03:40 im not interested in what it does
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:03:51 only what your group uses it for
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:28 solely a plane crazy based group?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:36 or does this core tech stuff extend to other games

general 2023-01-29 01:15:06 wtf am I doing
general 2023-01-29 01:15:07 am i having a stroke
general 2023-01-29 01:17:36 lo!!!
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:23:12 could also just be an insect on the lens
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:23:49 yea but a small one on the lens will look big at a distance
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:24:21 artifacting possible too
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:24:28 i doubt its a giant spider cos those only exist in australia
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:25:43 you good
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:26:03 this is average australian spider
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:00 could be an animal idk
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:30 yeah but animals have 4 legs dude
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:55 you can easily mistake it for moving like a spider since its multilegged
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:30:15 nah looks too small for a pit
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:01 cos if it was a pitbull sized spider it would appear smaller at that distance
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:22 the massive animal sized ones are all extinct
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:28 died with the dinosaurs
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:52 nah they're 100% dead lol
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:32:16 if they were still alive they'd be heavily documented
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:32:53 and like
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:00 giant insects evolved to be smaller anyway if they did survive
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:16 the reason they were that big was because earth had a higher oxygen content in the atmosphere
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:21 so it made it easier for bugs to grow larger
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:57 yeah dont worry lol you're not going to get facehugged by a giant spider
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:34:03 either artifacting or an animal
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:34:10 cameras do mess up sometimes
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:36:27 90cm wtf lo
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:36:32 theres no way
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:37:04 largest spider in modern age is 30cm

general 2023-02-10 08:42:00 not good for u
general 2023-02-10 08:43:07 wisdom and knowledge
general 2023-02-10 08:43:11 are universes apart
general 2023-02-10 08:43:25 unfortunately
general 2023-02-10 08:43:34 while you may have surface level knowledge on this topic (even if some parts are wrong)
general 2023-02-10 08:43:44 there is nothing to show you are wise rn
general 2023-02-10 08:45:54 go watch vsauce or something idk
general 2023-02-10 08:46:12 but remember that you truly wont understand this until you actually do the necessary course in university
general 2023-02-10 08:47:53 why would you skip grade 12
general 2023-02-10 08:48:13 if you dont know what a parabola is
general 2023-02-10 08:48:17 how are you skipping grade 12 for uni
general 2023-02-10 08:48:33 how about you learn quadratics first
general 2023-02-10 08:48:45 lol
general 2023-02-10 08:48:45 before trying to lecture pcc members on astrophysics
general 2023-02-10 08:48:51 ok learn it properly bro
general 2023-02-10 08:48:57 dont confuse it with a hyperbola again
general 2023-02-10 08:52:12 can you show us where you got that graph you're tring to replicate from
general 2023-02-10 08:52:17 or is that just filler
general 2023-02-10 08:52:37 yes
general 2023-02-10 08:52:41 where is the source
general 2023-02-10 08:53:05 ok
general 2023-02-10 08:53:12 but what does that have to do with the banach tarski paradox
general 2023-02-10 08:53:58 how about finding an actual representation on google
general 2023-02-10 08:54:33 because you as a grade 9 math student are probably not reliable to show off the 'banach-tarski paradox' that people with phds deal with
general 2023-02-10 08:55:24 so you just did some random stuff on a board and called it a theorem for upvotes bro
general 2023-02-10 08:56:12 why would you combine extremely basic knowledge with a theorem thats way ahead of you
general 2023-02-10 08:56:32 you cant just call it the banach tarski paradox if it does nothing to represent it
general 2023-02-10 08:56:40 thats like me saying im making a dog in plane crazy and it actually being a cat
general 2023-02-10 08:56:54 doesnt work like that bro
general 2023-02-10 08:57:27 what is this linear graph for
general 2023-02-10 08:57:57 what for
general 2023-02-10 08:58:00 how does this represent your theorem
general 2023-02-10 08:58:45 we already said
general 2023-02-10 08:58:46 its a hyperbola
general 2023-02-10 08:58:47 1/x
general 2023-02-10 08:59:04 but in this case you made -1/x
general 2023-02-10 08:59:18 physical education
general 2023-02-10 08:59:23 when you kick ball and it move
general 2023-02-10 09:00:03 shut up queerleer
general 2023-02-10 09:00:17 ok nimb you just have to listen
general 2023-02-10 09:00:22 because we have more experience in math

general 2023-02-10 09:03:20 yea but everyone catches up sooner or later
general 2023-02-10 09:03:22 it quickly becomes irrelevant

general 2023-02-12 06:13:27 they just see a stupidass concept of a tank that never came to fruition
general 2023-02-12 06:13:31 and think it'll be a good idea

general 2023-02-12 06:15:19 wargaming might as well add Die Glock to world of tanks and say it was based off blueprints found on the german moonbase in 1946 or something
general 2023-02-12 06:17:08 wolfenstein is a historical documentary
general 2023-02-12 06:17:59 they'll add the robo-moustacheman as a new superheavy tank

creations-chat 2023-02-13 08:36:26 his build isnt something any expert could do, and you specifically can only dream of that sort of building which is why you denigrate his work and downplay his master rank. to suggest that it’s easy is complete and utter bullshit you might as well be a whitename. show us the better builds you’ve seen then
creations-chat 2023-02-13 08:40:24 are you not going to show them?
creations-chat 2023-02-13 08:46:09 thought not, only thing you’re good at is talk. sure, the hof voters afe inconsistent, but that doesnt meant you can throw nightchasers build under the bus and claim that one of the builds is the pinnacle of pcc when it is in fact not. your condescending tone of speaking to a master rank about his build disgusts me when you have shown absolutely nothing worth of praise in <#384025409945337856>

general 2023-02-16 09:19:57 ukraine army grew to 700k from 200k
general 2023-02-16 09:20:02 how is it mostly foreign legions lol
general 2023-02-16 09:21:23 because they mobilised
general 2023-02-16 09:21:35 thats how russia is also calling more to ukraine
general 2023-02-16 09:23:36 not politics just common sense
general 2023-02-16 09:23:48 if your country is at risk of complete annihilation
general 2023-02-16 09:24:11 of course there would be more soldiers being conscripted/volunteering
general 2023-02-16 09:25:33 in ww2 the red army had 2 mil in 1939
general 2023-02-16 09:25:40 by 1945 this became 11mill
general 2023-02-16 09:25:49 despite all losses
general 2023-02-16 09:27:00 ukraine still has a massive manpower pool to draw from
general 2023-02-16 09:27:49 german tanks coming to fight the russians again
general 2023-02-16 09:28:05 battle of kursk 2 when
general 2023-02-16 09:29:19 still needed
general 2023-02-16 09:29:28 while western tanks arent in high enough number
general 2023-02-16 09:29:42 they can still bolster numbers for a new breakthrough
general 2023-02-16 09:31:21 ukraine is fine at logistics
general 2023-02-16 09:31:29 theyre not the ones giving away free t72s
general 2023-02-16 09:38:55 remember when the russians were 30km from kiev
general 2023-02-16 09:39:04 then the ukrainians just pulled off the biggest comeback
general 2023-02-16 09:40:20 yea i know they were dropping in spetsnaz and VDV to target zelenskyy
general 2023-02-16 09:40:31 but bulk of it wasnt super close
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 09:45:57 no
general 2023-02-16 09:46:21 is russia still maintaining that they are fighting nato
general 2023-02-16 09:46:32 or did they stop the copium
general 2023-02-16 09:49:10 lol
general 2023-02-16 09:49:22 so 20k foreign legion against half a million russian soldiers
general 2023-02-16 09:49:27 somehow the 20k is the entirety of nato
general 2023-02-16 09:49:29 seems legit
general 2023-02-16 09:49:43 for the funny
general 2023-02-16 09:49:59 not always
general 2023-02-16 09:50:09 some units were actually well equipped

general 2023-02-16 09:50:28 not most
general 2023-02-16 09:50:34 shit equipment does happen
general 2023-02-16 09:50:48 but its not the case a lot of the time
general 2023-02-16 09:52:17 they have dumbasses too
general 2023-02-16 09:52:23 and russians dont work well with wagner sometimes
general 2023-02-16 09:52:33 in syria US forces fought wagner
general 2023-02-16 09:52:38 but putin denied them being russian troops
general 2023-02-16 09:52:40 so the US just merked all of them
general 2023-02-16 09:53:26 and about the weapons
general 2023-02-16 09:53:38 <@456226577798135808> there are cases of russians having good shit too
general 2023-02-16 09:53:57 you mightve seen the image of the trophy AS VAL at chernobyl
general 2023-02-16 09:54:07 which is a lot more expensive than your average AK47
general 2023-02-16 09:59:42 he just grinded for as val
general 2023-02-16 09:59:58 in chernobyl
general 2023-02-16 10:00:29 russians somehow taking damage (theyve just dug into a radioactive forest)
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:06:47 explosives are fucking shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:07:02 the pvp meta right now is just spamming fireworks and rockets with a high speed jet
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:07:18 there needs to be a weapon that actually rewards skill
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:07:25 esif
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:07:28 look at the besiege cannons
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:07:38 they are very good examples
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:28 pvp weapons need to be less spammable in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:31 i think ammo should be a thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:39 so the more you have the faster it drains
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:46 and ammo blocks like fuel blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:49 except actually useful
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:08:55 and ammo blocks explode when destroyed
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:09:08 so if you spam weapons
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:09:10 theres a downside too
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:09:14 you get risk of ammorack
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:09:51 yea and ammo blocks will mean larger builds dont get melted
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:09:55 by a smallass plane with 10 guns and 10 rockets
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:10:06 because larger creations can actually support more weapons
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:10:16 while smaller creations cant
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:10:54 and maybe they have to return to base or a safezone to refill
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:02 guns need a buff if anything
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:14 cos rn unless you spam 10
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:16 they are dogshit
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:32 flamethrowers need rework too
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:37 the range is comedically small
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:42 and the damage is shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:11:58 rick needs to give us this
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:12:09 instead of the shitty lavaspitter we have now
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:14:25 even handheld flamethrower can reach up to 40m
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:14:32 lava spitter goes nowhere near
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:14:58 yea flamethrowers arent like in films or games
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:15:02 where you have to be practically in their face
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:16:13 oh and thats just ww2
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:16:22 flamethrower during vietnam 60m
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:16:54 vehicle mounted flamethrowers could reach 100m
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:17:00 thats like 4 plots long
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:17:43 obviously it'll be too op for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:17:49 so maybe nerfed to 1 plot at the very least
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:18:02 or allow a setting with compromise
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:18:05 higher range with less spread
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:18:08 or lower range with more spread
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:18:13 similar to irl
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:19:51 so maybe 1 plot max distance with spread like this
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:20:18 and a close range flamethrower more like this
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:24:48 explosive blocks should also stack up in radius
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:24:52 idk how rick could pull this off
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:25:20 but it doesnt make sense how you can compress 50 tnts and have them all explode with the same blast radius
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:25:35 or maybe he could introduce different classes of explosives
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:26:09 incendiary explosives when
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:26:30 no im in jail
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:26:37 make water jet useful
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:26:38 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:27:07 if actual flamethrowers become a thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:27:14 waterjet needs more range and splash radius
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:29:47 knockback should be a thing with all pvp weapons too
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:29:57 if a small shredder gets blown up
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:30:11 the build should just get thrown into an uncontrollable direction
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:30:30 roblos physics idk
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:40:46 play what
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 10:46:08 ok
general 2023-02-16 10:55:32 you will raid my toenail
general 2023-02-16 11:16:54 why do you not go to school
general 2023-02-16 11:17:09 you shouldnt be bragging about skipping school
general 2023-02-16 11:17:13 because you are effectively bragging about being stupid
general 2023-02-16 11:17:47 yeah great, keep doing that when you're an adult and have to fend for yourself
general 2023-02-16 11:18:05 what do you want to be when you grow up
general 2023-02-16 11:18:36 do you want to go to university to have the chance of a comfortable job
general 2023-02-16 11:18:57 what is a lokfuhrer
general 2023-02-16 11:19:08 yea fuck him
general 2023-02-16 11:19:09 absolute loser
general 2023-02-16 11:22:15 school gives you an idea of what you want to be when you grow up
general 2023-02-16 11:22:23 and a lot of the skills you learn actually do come into play when you pursue that certain career
general 2023-02-16 11:22:33 like for example, math
general 2023-02-16 11:22:39 you may not like it, but what if you wanted to become a scientist
general 2023-02-16 11:22:43 an engineer
general 2023-02-16 11:22:47 an accountant
general 2023-02-16 11:22:51 a mathematician
general 2023-02-16 11:23:16 people can argue about how you dont need to know quadratics all they like
general 2023-02-16 11:23:20 but they dont realise it actually has value in STEM
general 2023-02-16 11:24:05 plane crazy developer
general 2023-02-16 11:24:08 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-02-16 11:25:20 same shit
general 2023-02-16 11:25:23 all the time
general 2023-02-16 11:25:52 if you dont want to do math
general 2023-02-16 11:25:55 you are doomed for a shitty career
general 2023-02-16 11:26:03 most millionaires inherited their money
general 2023-02-16 11:26:07 doesnt count
general 2023-02-16 11:26:16 is that why they are all stupid
general 2023-02-16 11:26:18 lo!!
general 2023-02-16 11:26:24 rare
general 2023-02-16 11:26:45 i dont know a lot of people who want to become historians
general 2023-02-16 11:26:54 most people who shit on math become trade workers
general 2023-02-16 11:26:59 so theres that
general 2023-02-16 11:27:30 vcal moment
general 2023-02-16 11:27:50 wow smart
general 2023-02-16 11:27:51 what atar
general 2023-02-16 11:28:36 have you done a 3&4 subject already
general 2023-02-16 13:59:34 skill issue
general 2023-02-17 07:18:07 suggestive

general 2023-02-17 11:06:48 <@573970670854340628>
general 2023-02-17 14:21:23 show me your idea so i can post it in <#384025409945337856> for you
general 2023-02-17 14:21:24 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-02-17 14:25:17 what game
general 2023-02-17 14:26:17 seems pretty generic
general 2023-02-17 14:26:35 no grenade?
general 2023-02-17 14:26:53 of what sort
general 2023-02-17 14:27:03 are they just your generic fps grenades
general 2023-02-17 14:27:33 funny molotov where
general 2023-02-17 14:28:02 lol why not
general 2023-02-17 14:28:16 area denial
general 2023-02-17 14:28:24 you can cut off a chokepoint for a few seconds with fire
general 2023-02-17 14:28:36 thats a you problem
general 2023-02-17 14:28:42 just get skiled
general 2023-02-17 14:29:00 when you decided to make everything destructible
general 2023-02-17 14:29:07 it was going to lag anyway
general 2023-02-17 14:30:37 why would molotovs make small holes
general 2023-02-17 14:31:03 ok and how would explosives work
general 2023-02-17 14:31:06 do they not collapse buildings
general 2023-02-17 14:31:23 how does destruction work then
general 2023-02-17 14:31:28 if everything is anchored
general 2023-02-17 14:31:46 yes but
general 2023-02-17 14:31:50 when you take out the entire base of a building
general 2023-02-17 14:31:52 it'll still be floating
general 2023-02-17 14:31:56 thats not destruction lol
general 2023-02-17 14:32:08 you
general 2023-02-17 14:32:16 no
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:07:32 the rockets or tnt missiles
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:10:03 because plane crazy is shit and broken
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:10:24 you dont
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:10:26 just press the toggle
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:11:45 because the plane has to move slowly
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:11:52 or they manually detonate
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:12:16 if you use impact trigger on a high speed plane it will not deal damage
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:12:21 because the impact trigger has a huge delay
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:12:50 does that help
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:15:54 when the tnt hits an object
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:16:03 it doesnt instantly explode
general 2023-02-18 00:19:10 is this normal
general 2023-02-18 00:19:28 i cant use this for pvp anymore lol
general 2023-02-18 00:19:43 1 shot and whole build comes apart
general 2023-02-18 00:19:46 tank
general 2023-02-18 00:20:51 ok

plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:29:11 manual detonation
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:54:54 why report them for telling the truth
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:55:07 LO
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:57:59 just use whatever u want lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:58:04 trapdoors and disconnectors same shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:58:17 not an opinion
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 01:58:21 literally almost no difference

creations-chat 2023-02-19 03:17:43 oh I thought ZLT11 was some random gibberish. yea its not a tank btw, more like an spg. 
i dont advise posting an unfinished build into <#384025409945337856> because you are missing a significant portion of it + no paint
help 2023-02-19 03:18:10 dont worry about that stuff

general 2023-02-21 06:16:44 so true
general 2023-02-21 06:17:39 rocket needs minimum arming distance
general 2023-02-21 06:17:50 so you cant just crash into a build and blow some poor sod point blank
general 2023-02-21 06:18:15 and it'll make you actually have to aim too
general 2023-02-21 06:18:34 another benefit is that it prevents you from blowing your own build up
general 2023-02-21 06:18:43 and minimum arming distance for rockets exist irl
general 2023-02-21 07:26:07 lame build

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:20 no originality
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:48 pvp is a torture chamber
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:57:56 building and driving/flying my builds is already enough fun
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:58:13 pvp is just cheesing a shitty meta because of broken physics and gameplay oversights

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:59:45 average pvp fighter relies on hover drives to go 1k speed and rams into ground vehicles before unloading all 10 rockets and flying away
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:59:48 thats the meta right now
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 10:59:50 and its so shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:00:46 might be controversial
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:00:56 but i think wings, trapdoors and disconnectors need health nerf
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:16 cos in pvp some namnam mfs can still fly normally with half their jet left
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:01:42 shoot their tail off and clip their left wing? thats fine because they spamming an unholy amount of control surfaces on the other
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:02:51 rickje better rework rocket
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:02:57 main weapon of namnam planes because they cant aim
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:03 so they literally crash into you to blow you up
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:51 lock on missiles not coming
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:04:00 cos they rather build ur own
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:05:25 rockets need higher velocity and minimum arming distance
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:05:34 thats all thats needed for a rework
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:05:55 yea buff tracking significantly
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:02 but nerf damage of tracking rockets
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:12 so nontracking rockets still viable
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:44 not coming
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:48 lock on missiles will be aids
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:51 cos no skill
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:54 fire and forget
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:04 and it will fuck ground vehicles up even harder
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:10 cos they cant use flares lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:37 buffed tracking rockets is better than lock on missiles
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:48 flares dont work on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:56 have you seen a single irl ground vehicle with anti missile flares
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:08:41 or just make them slower too
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:08:44 so you can shoot them down
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:00 guns
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:02 what else
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:13 not like you’re going to use a lava spitter on them
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:57 nah just give the missiles weak ho
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:58 hp
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:10:33 missile hp less than a wing or something
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:10:51 yea maybe missiles that only work high altitude
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:02 and once they fly lower altitude it loses locking
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:17 fireworks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:21 but fireworks are weak rn
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:28 they might be buffed for pc2
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:53 i might make a doc with pvp rework ideas
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:29 what u guys think about fragmentation, incendiary and concussion tnt block variants
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:33 that you can set in config
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:15:37 tnt rn shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:16:09 blast radius a bit shit for practical use
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:16:48 you need a tnt practically ontop of a build to do major damage
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:17:02 if it blows up a block away it just tickles
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:17:36 wait that gives new idea
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:17:43 what about configurable fuse delay
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:18:57 lock on missiles will make hover engine plane meta even stronger though
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:02 its harder to lock on fast build
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:11 while they can easily lock onto you from their pov
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:38 we want more variation for the meta
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:51 so we cant unintentionally buff/nerf the wrong build archetypes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:20:40 rn namnam planes and shredders are the worst offenders of shitty meta
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:08 except shredders are getting hard nerfed in pc2 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:29 rickje reworking cutters
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:22:28 the ammo system i was talking about is a must have for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:22:45 it will indirectly nerf fast jet builds and make slower aircraft/ground vehicles stronger
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:11 i will tell later too lazy rn
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:23 ask dudeiamstuk
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:33 <@495210490172014612> you
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:33:34 ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:33:53 so every pvp weapon will rely on ammo blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:34:01 depending on what the weapon is, it will drain the ammo block at different rates
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:34:03 similar to a fuel block
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:34:50 ammo blocks at high capacity explode like a tnt when destroyed by another player
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:02 and they way they are refilled will be through returning to spawn
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:26 so this nerfs small builds that rely on maxing out weapons
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:32 e.g tutorial plane with 10 guns
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:37 yea
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:42 pc2 pvp with safezones would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:59 nah
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:05 it can be alleviated
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:19 if you exit a safezone you have 5-10 seconds before pvp is enabled on your build
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:29 so you can still position yourself outside a safezone without getting blown up instantly
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:39 and vice versa
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:48 if someone tries to escape combat by going into a safezone
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:55 they have to be in that safezone for 5-10 seconds for pvp to be disabled
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:37:01 so they cant just cheese it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:40:36 yes but if they can compress ammo boxes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:40:47 it will be really heavy on their build
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:40:54 the micro fighter wont even be able to fly properly
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:41:43 people will def compress ammo boxes and keep them in some irrelevant spot on their build
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:41:55 I reckon weapons should only work if an ammo box is within a certain distance from them
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:42:11 to stop people spamming ammo blocks at spawn not connected to their main build
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:42:27 because thats how fuel blocks are abused rn (no one uses fuel anyway)
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:43:26 so real
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:43:55 ammo blocks will actually make evasion in planes more of a thing too
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:05 rather than flying head on and crashing into other planes or ground targets
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:09 since theres a real risk of getting ammoracked
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:26 and planes dont really have much protection
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:44:34 real
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:51:59 rockets need better range just reduced damage

general 2023-02-22 11:56:48 no
general 2023-02-22 11:56:51 just talk normally
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:57:30 missiles would be a bit useless if theyre not lock on
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:57:38 and if theyre lock on they just made pvp even worse
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:58:10 even though it might seem fun it barely shakes up the meta and indirectly buffs namnam jets and hover engine spam

general 2023-02-28 14:12:42 no
general 2023-02-28 14:12:45 that isnt a real torsion bar though
general 2023-02-28 14:13:22 you cant make random shit and call it a torsion bar
general 2023-02-28 14:13:26 cos if you want to make it accurate
general 2023-02-28 14:13:42 it will be more difficult to finetune than what people normally build (i.e wishbone, christie etc.)
general 2023-02-28 14:21:23 i dont think you can even consider it a simplified version of one
general 2023-02-28 14:22:35 cos the motor2 doesnt really count as a torsion bar
general 2023-02-28 14:22:39 at one point should be static
general 2023-02-28 14:22:46 except here its allowed to rotate at both ends. so there's no real torsion on the motor itself

general 2023-03-01 10:37:40 only a handful actually take pride in their work and accept criticism well
general 2023-03-01 10:37:53 the rest are either trolling or undes
general 2023-03-01 10:38:59 wdym
general 2023-03-01 10:39:06 how is funny build relevant
general 2023-03-01 10:39:17 we talking about quality in general
general 2023-03-01 10:40:08 the question is why
general 2023-03-01 10:40:16 and the answer is rather simple
general 2023-03-01 10:40:32 they are ignorant and want to show off
general 2023-03-01 10:41:17 it doesnt take someone more than 5 mins of looking through the server to see what is considered an acceptable build
general 2023-03-01 10:41:31 if they have no concept, they are simply dumb im sorry
general 2023-03-01 10:41:50 thats the issue
general 2023-03-01 10:42:19 whitenames may call experts arrogant, but theyre oblivious to their overinflated value they ascribe to their own build
general 2023-03-01 10:42:40 🤷‍♂️
general 2023-03-01 10:42:48 not as often
general 2023-03-01 10:42:55 and experts do get bullied too
general 2023-03-01 10:43:04 so its not a whitename only thing
general 2023-03-01 10:43:12 its just that whitenames are more likely to be dumb
general 2023-03-01 10:43:16 and thats facts
general 2023-03-01 10:43:20 you cant argue with that
general 2023-03-01 10:44:00 how does the community’s behaviour have any bearing on their own behaviour
general 2023-03-01 10:44:03 what strawman is this
general 2023-03-01 10:46:24 dude you just pulled that stat out of you ass
general 2023-03-01 10:46:43 ok then why present it as an argument
general 2023-03-01 10:46:50 if its clearly not right
general 2023-03-01 10:46:52 ????
general 2023-03-01 10:47:13 ok so clearly not right, now you’re calling it an estimate
general 2023-03-01 10:47:37 ok i estimate 100% of whitenames have below 90 iq
general 2023-03-01 10:47:48 dont argue with that or u just deeping it bro

general 2023-03-01 10:54:06 guy who downvoted everything
general 2023-03-01 10:54:28 he upvoted only a few builds so he could play it off as being fair,  but the few builds he upvoted were shit too 💀
general 2023-03-01 10:55:36 size doesnt matter

general 2023-03-01 11:18:43 normal in public schools full of dumbasses maybe
general 2023-03-01 11:18:49 but nearly none of them last
general 2023-03-01 11:19:28 not that common
general 2023-03-01 11:20:05 why does that matter
general 2023-03-01 11:20:15 serious relationships arent common in middle school

general 2023-03-01 12:10:55 fuckin weirdos
general 2023-03-01 12:12:04 gender dysphoria is literally a mental illness
general 2023-03-01 12:12:17 so lgbt just promotes mental illness for some reason??
general 2023-03-01 12:12:23 ofc
general 2023-03-01 12:12:36 the queers will argue intersex exists
general 2023-03-01 12:12:39 but thats a disability
general 2023-03-01 12:12:42 its not natural
general 2023-03-01 12:14:39 i love well dressed women
general 2023-03-01 12:16:01 lol men wont complain
general 2023-03-01 12:17:26 because they fought for actual issues
general 2023-03-01 12:17:49 the only ones doing shit now are the ones in third world countries like iran
general 2023-03-01 12:18:42 i think feminism has been distorted over time
general 2023-03-01 12:18:50 feminism in its purest sense is a just cause
general 2023-03-01 12:18:54 still relevant for today
general 2023-03-01 12:19:11 i.e educational restrictions for women in afghanistan and iran
general 2023-03-01 12:21:21 not rlly
general 2023-03-01 12:21:39 they just think eating animals is cruel…even though we’ve been doing it for tens of thousands of years
general 2023-03-01 12:23:23 plants
general 2023-03-01 12:23:28 plants are everywhere dude
general 2023-03-01 12:23:32 just eat grass
general 2023-03-01 12:23:40 animal still happy
general 2023-03-01 12:23:41 ez
general 2023-03-01 12:24:41 wtf
general 2023-03-01 12:27:39 plants feeling pain is media sensationalism
general 2023-03-01 12:28:22 the “pain” is just a response to harmful stimuli, not pain as humans experience it
general 2023-03-01 12:28:28 they have no brains
general 2023-03-01 12:28:37 they have no sapience or sentience
general 2023-03-01 12:28:42 how can they feel pain
general 2023-03-01 12:28:52 they feel just as much “pain” as a bacterium does
general 2023-03-01 12:29:10 they dont notice anything
general 2023-03-01 12:29:16 they arent conscious
general 2023-03-01 12:29:18 they just exist
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 07:31:13 maybe some other time
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 07:31:25 am busy rn
general 2023-03-02 10:42:27 shit fps game
general 2023-03-02 10:43:18 been 2015 since pf was out but devs still cant figure out how to balance teams and patch the most common exploits
general 2023-03-02 10:44:33 yeah and they cant grow past the same boring formula
general 2023-03-02 10:44:42 every gun is a reskin at this point
general 2023-03-02 10:45:11 and attachments are so wacky because they only want content, CONTENT, CONTENT.
general 2023-03-02 10:45:21 content with no real depth
general 2023-03-02 10:45:30 only so they can tick off the ‘update’ box
general 2023-03-02 10:46:10 assault rifles feel the same, sniper rifles feel the same, smgs feel the same
general 2023-03-02 10:46:21 very rarely are there exceptions
general 2023-03-02 10:46:37 the only differentiating factor is slightly tweaked stats
general 2023-03-02 10:49:41 pf tries to simulate realistic ballistics but grenades still have no shrapnel
general 2023-03-02 10:49:44 L game tbh
general 2023-03-02 10:50:26 of course i knew
general 2023-03-02 10:50:34 i was there for the alpha
general 2023-03-02 10:50:50 which was unironically better than pf now
general 2023-03-02 10:51:23 before it became cursed tanmk sim but for guns
general 2023-03-02 10:51:58 lasers somehow decreasing recoil and attachments that wouldnt even be possible
general 2023-03-02 10:52:38 past the early stages of the game, the devs focused less on innovation
general 2023-03-02 10:52:48 and more on bloating the game with useless items
general 2023-03-02 10:53:31 ww2 guns that outperform modern weapons
general 2023-03-02 10:53:43 realism
general 2023-03-02 10:53:54 ong
general 2023-03-02 10:54:07 why is every bullet a tracer in pf
general 2023-03-02 10:54:49 like tracers for snipers make sense cos of balancing
general 2023-03-02 10:55:10 but cqc weapons having all tracers, even shotguns with pellets, is a bit dumb
general 2023-03-02 10:55:40 dude pf ttk is so bad
general 2023-03-02 10:55:52 whoever has better internet wins
general 2023-03-02 10:56:01 either
general 2023-03-02 10:56:11 exactly lol
general 2023-03-02 10:57:46 pf goes for realistic ballistics but devs have no concept of calibre lol. 5.56mm weapons somehow less accurate than 7.62mm
general 2023-03-02 10:58:22 fuck whatever else theyre introducing
general 2023-03-02 10:58:27 theyre game is already well behind
general 2023-03-02 10:58:32 the devs got cocky imo
general 2023-03-02 10:59:27 also respawn system still broken af since 2015
general 2023-03-02 10:59:43 i love having the teleportation brigade respawn behind me and put two bullets in the back of my head
general 2023-03-02 10:59:53 i shouldnt have to double take behind me every 5 secs
general 2023-03-02 11:00:05 no fps game is that bad
general 2023-03-02 11:01:51 who cares about gacha
general 2023-03-02 11:09:27 zeroing in deadline is so wack
general 2023-03-02 11:09:34 no real way to find range either
general 2023-03-02 11:11:21 hows this zeroing
general 2023-03-02 11:11:34 i just want my sights to be calibrated properly dammit deadline!!

general 2023-03-02 13:04:52 im homophobic!!!
general 2023-03-02 13:05:26 whats next <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-03-02 13:06:36 hang yourself now!!!
general 2023-03-02 13:06:50 homosexuality is a mental defect
general 2023-03-02 13:06:53 its not natural
general 2023-03-02 13:07:14 just because paralysis existed before humans doesnt mean its an acceptable “norm”
general 2023-03-02 13:08:15 because most sexual assaults are done by homos
general 2023-03-02 13:08:28 and even then
general 2023-03-02 13:08:33 they hurt themselves more than others
general 2023-03-02 13:08:56 search it up rn
general 2023-03-02 13:12:08 lets blame religion for people not supporting mental illness!!!
general 2023-03-02 13:12:50 it was considered a mental illness until growing pressure from lgbt forced changes in the medical community
general 2023-03-02 13:13:18 therefore a specific group of mentally ill people dont like being called mentally ill
general 2023-03-02 13:14:05 hurts themselves more: higher rate of self-harm, other mental health issues, STDs, STIs, overall slightly lower life expectancy, more likely to be victim of sexual assault
general 2023-03-02 13:14:21 so i say to you, cope harder
general 2023-03-02 13:15:02 this can be found on research articles and government websites stfu lol
general 2023-03-02 13:15:43 we cant have a proper debate if you keep pretending im faking sources because i have an ulterior motive
general 2023-03-02 13:15:55 whats your source that being homosexual has no negative impact?
general 2023-03-02 13:16:03 exactly shut up
general 2023-03-02 13:17:12 oh wow you’re such a genius, cant even do a quick google search and take a look at the ncbi stats. fucking smart one you are
general 2023-03-02 13:17:36 saying theres no negative impact is a lie lol
general 2023-03-02 13:18:02 ok burden of providing your evidence doesnt fall on me either
general 2023-03-02 13:19:02 from what source
general 2023-03-02 13:19:03 LMAO
general 2023-03-02 13:19:10 you want this same circular argument
general 2023-03-02 13:19:16 so you get a source
general 2023-03-02 13:19:39 seriously man get a life and just use your 2 brain cells to go on a reputable gov website and take a look at the stats just lying there

general 2023-03-04 10:50:10 what country are you from
general 2023-03-04 10:51:07 anzac bob semple ally can hold off an axis invasion dont worry
general 2023-03-04 10:51:49 dont think theyd even try invading
general 2023-03-04 10:51:54 theyd just keep bombing until we surrender
general 2023-03-04 10:52:01 like the germans tried to do to britain
general 2023-03-04 10:52:08 because germany couldnt invade the uk
general 2023-03-04 10:52:47 that was just to keep aus on its toes and locked into defending the continent
general 2023-03-04 10:53:04 there was no real intent to invade cos they were dealing with the US too
general 2023-03-04 10:53:34 most of the australians killed in ww2 were at singapore
general 2023-03-04 10:53:49 prob not
general 2023-03-04 10:53:51 its all desert
general 2023-03-04 10:54:02 most of it
general 2023-03-04 10:54:09 theyd have to go along the coast
general 2023-03-04 10:54:16 and that means facing off against waves of coastal batteries
general 2023-03-04 10:54:21 theyre not gonna do that lol
general 2023-03-04 10:55:28 aus probably wouldve surrendered if brit joined axis
general 2023-03-04 10:55:49 cos brit was carrying australian defence hard
general 2023-03-04 10:56:02 well up until singapore fell anyway
general 2023-03-04 10:58:40 brits lost singapore cos they thought their fortress was impregnable
general 2023-03-04 10:58:49 so they neglected basically everything
general 2023-03-04 10:58:54 (it was not impregnable)
general 2023-03-04 10:59:06 then uk newspapers blame australia

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:47:01 without motorlocking at least
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:47:13 and by this i mean u cant do it without it looking bad
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:47:27 why arent your wheels interleaved btw
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:47:54 like the front 2
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:48:14 the front 2 are only interleaved
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:48:16 the rest arent
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:48:29 if u dont interleave its not a king tiger
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:48:43 no u dont just use half wheels

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:52:24 dont do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:52:47 the centre part of the wheel cant be replicated well without motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:52:51 they just make peoples build's look worse
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:52:56 i've seen many king tigers
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:53:01 nightchaser has the best one in the whole game

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:53:34 make the tone a bit deeper
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:53:42 then once ur done u can add some slight variation for weathering
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:54:11 what plane is this
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:54:14 no
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:54:18 i mean yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:54:25 but only slight difference
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:54:43 parts closer to the ground will be more weathered because of dirt

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:55:25 his 'desert' tone is darker
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:55:33 because thats how dunkelgelb is supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:56:50 dont do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:56:56 just make the variations random for the hull
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:57:07 tracks and wheels will need bigger adjustments to the colour
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:57:29 ok just wheels
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:57:42 and the colours are too different
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:57:48 just make ur 1st tone perfect
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:57:53 then move onto weathering at the end after u finish
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:58:12 yes just make the colour flat for now
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 09:58:16 dont do weathering until u finish

general 2023-03-11 01:58:26 i mean its inflating
general 2023-03-11 01:58:31 but we're not at great depression tiers of shit
general 2023-03-11 01:58:41 dude
general 2023-03-11 01:59:06 the last depression is whitenames killing themselves because someone downvoted their build
general 2023-03-11 01:59:31 ok
general 2023-03-11 01:59:33 so fallout 5
general 2023-03-11 01:59:52 how
general 2023-03-11 02:00:34 fallout 5 doesnt even exist rn
general 2023-03-11 02:00:45 but how are you sure the next recession will be that bad
general 2023-03-11 02:00:52 we dont have hard proof that it WILL happen either
general 2023-03-11 02:01:05 dude wars ruin economies even further
general 2023-03-11 02:01:44 during the great depression germany was still paying off reparations from ww1
general 2023-03-11 02:01:45 they're fine today
general 2023-03-11 02:02:24 how
general 2023-03-11 02:04:02 
general 2023-03-11 02:04:09 so in fact unemployment is less today than a decade ago
general 2023-03-11 02:04:27 how are you sure there will be no jobs
general 2023-03-11 02:05:03 we've been having advancements in automation for over a decade now
general 2023-03-11 02:05:12 employment has gone up
general 2023-03-11 02:06:37 when do you think this economic crash will happen
general 2023-03-11 02:07:55 what sort of jobs do you believe AI will replace
general 2023-03-11 02:08:23 dont you think these advancements will open up new jobs in the tech industry
general 2023-03-11 02:09:35 people will always be there to put AI in check
general 2023-03-11 02:10:44 humans still need to develop the hardware AI will work on
general 2023-03-11 02:12:19 i mean factories today are largely automated
general 2023-03-11 02:12:30 it didnt take jobs away as much as it created new ones
general 2023-03-11 02:15:03 oh no!! they took jobs away from the monks who would copy the entire bible from scratch!!!
general 2023-03-11 02:15:12 what will they do now
general 2023-03-11 02:16:46 how do you know it caused mass suicides
general 2023-03-11 02:16:58 the monks had plenty of other tasks and the printing press lessened their burden
general 2023-03-11 02:18:10 ok good
general 2023-03-11 02:18:13 so less unemployment

general 2023-03-11 11:45:15 <@884430928418582528> say hi kid
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:46:58 why
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:47:00 everyone uses motor2
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:47:22 ngl
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:47:22 sounds like skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:47:39 ok show the build
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:49:08 why dont u raise the turret a slight bit using a locked piston
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:54:26 not my fault you're not being specific enough dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:54:55 if motor2 is not working for elevation you genuinely have a skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:55:14 esp since this is not motor 2 bugging out
general 2023-03-11 11:55:51 rise of shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:57:24 no shit its not the motor2
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:57:32 this is a turret design issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:59:08 do you really think its better to completely trade away offensive potential
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 12:00:19 the lack of an effective elevation means you can die to something as fragile as an ornithoper strafing you because you cant shoot back
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 12:01:25 everyone with a vertical stabiliser

general 2023-03-13 12:28:59 havent played the new one
general 2023-03-13 12:29:08 from what i heard campaign is too short to be worth
general 2023-03-13 12:29:14 multiplayer is fun but boring quick
general 2023-03-13 12:29:24 *i've played the multiplayer
general 2023-03-13 12:29:50 no the new one more people are shitting on lol
general 2023-03-13 12:30:08 now im going to keep playing warpath 2
general 2023-03-13 12:30:31 wym
general 2023-03-13 12:31:01 your brain dont work cos u play pf
general 2023-03-13 12:31:24 play a diff fps that takes your brain
general 2023-03-13 12:31:34 pf just eats away at it
general 2023-03-13 12:31:41 you go into autopilot because the gunplay is so braindead
general 2023-03-13 12:32:01 that's before your whole server starts getting attacked by the teleporting exploiter who knifes your whole team
general 2023-03-13 12:32:33 pf is so easy to cheat it's not even funny
general 2023-03-13 12:32:38 its like the devs dont even try to prevent exploits
general 2023-03-13 12:32:45 i got a mate who exploits all the time
general 2023-03-13 12:33:28 i've been in exploiting streams with him, and pf is literally easier to exploit than some backwater games where devs havent touched them for 2 years
general 2023-03-13 12:33:54 all they need is that new gun to draw in the dumbass kids who play it
general 2023-03-13 12:34:01 its like the meepcity new dragon egg update uwu owo
general 2023-03-13 12:34:08 instantly attracts the 12 year olds
general 2023-03-13 12:34:45 some exploits have existed since the very dawn of pf
general 2023-03-13 12:34:48 theres no excuse at all
general 2023-03-13 12:35:08 i remember the teleporting knifers since alpha testing
general 2023-03-13 12:35:21 i was there before pf was front page
general 2023-03-13 12:35:54 lol none of the guns are unique
general 2023-03-13 12:35:58 theyre the same shit with slightly diff stats
general 2023-03-13 12:36:02 almost negligible
general 2023-03-13 12:36:07 hecate and bfg basically same shit for example
general 2023-03-13 12:38:45 singleplayer or multi
general 2023-03-13 12:39:03 idk they all went to shit
general 2023-03-13 12:39:12 devs stopped caring same with pf
general 2023-03-13 12:39:22 squad was pretty good
general 2023-03-13 12:39:30 but they got bought out by the chinese
general 2023-03-13 12:39:51 yea
general 2023-03-13 12:40:01 the one where u needed actual skill
general 2023-03-13 12:41:39 bf1 still seems good
general 2023-03-13 12:41:41 but i havent played in years
general 2023-03-13 12:41:56 u can get super cheap on sale though
general 2023-03-13 12:42:02 bf1 still seems to be doing quite well in terms of playercount
general 2023-03-13 12:42:10 campaign is one of the strongest ones in battlefield history too
general 2023-03-13 12:42:43 cos new one is shit
general 2023-03-13 12:42:46 bf1 is considered a masterpiece
general 2023-03-13 12:42:54 graphically holds up very well too
general 2023-03-13 12:43:04 u cant even tell it was released what, 5 years ago?

plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:39:05 camlock is shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:39:13 dont ever recommend it to anyone
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:39:38 even piston locking is less of an inconvenience
creations-chat 2023-03-21 02:42:55 Z
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:43:24 yes it does matter
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:43:30 cos rickje knows and doesnt give a shit
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:43:52 its been like this since motor2s existed
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:44:29 hes just skipping to pc2, except we might not even get that this year at this rate
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:45:18 yes but i rather use piston lock than cameralock
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:45:34 piston lock at least has unique uses
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:46:01 cameralock is just lazy angle lock that doesnt save and is unpredictable garbage

bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:54:28 <:clueless:942802644043464734>

general 2023-03-21 09:17:11 i do love ethnic cleansing
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:08 not all cr units are in coc though
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:22 and if he makes megaknight
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:26 he deserves to burn in hell for all eternity
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:47 megaknight users have no brain
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:22:02 they think its just the win button but get fked from a guy with 2.6 hog cycle
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:03 megaknight try not to waste 7 elixir challenge (impossible)
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:26 it isnt
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:49 it can destroy a 13 elixir golem push and still have counterpush potential
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:00 beatdown decks are rarer now
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:02 just because of megaknight
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:27 yea but megaknight can already sweep up supporting troops
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:31 they wont have high hp
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:25:19 the point of megaknight is to kill a 13 elixir push and still be tanky enough to counterpush only for 7 elixir
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:25:44 granted nobody with megaknight has a brain so they cant use his op ass properly
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:06 who even uses night witch lol
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:19 and with fisherman you can kingtower activate lots of things so it really doesnt matter
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:58 often you have to sacrifice megaknight getting jump hit on your princess tower before that even works
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:05 90% of the time megaknight is easy to kill because the person using it is completely braindead
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:17 if they actually have a solid deck and play well you are in trouble
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:31 that 1 card will counter entire beatdown decks

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:39:48 you round it to a foot
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:40:01 because a foot is 30cm give or take
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:40:19 doesnt rlly matter tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:40:31 the stud to irl value conversion is already wack anyway

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:50 ok fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:56:35 if roblox avatars were 5.5 the npc would be taller
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:57:02 now at 5 studs, sure its a little higher because of the mesh but its practically 5, a lot closer than 5.5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:00:37 are you looking at the hitbox height as a whole
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:01 or did you add up the size y values of each character component
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:15 because if you did the second
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:16 it'd be 5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:41 the player model is what we've been talking about
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:56 hitbox is irrelevant when determining actual height
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:02:55 ok not necessarily
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:00 because roblox meshes have fucked up hitboxes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:20 if you have done a little bit of building or modelling in roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:22 you will notice how bad it is
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:06:02 skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:06:14 looks very messy
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:06:38 sounds like copium
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:06:43 you can be good and still have a life
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:06:47 didnt think you knew that
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:07:19 ok what other games do you play?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:08:58 what does copying namnam have to do with it lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:10:41 just because some queer put dedication into this doesnt make it good you 11 year old
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:12:07 he couldve had the motors in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:12:12 or offset/magnet lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:12:15 if he knew how to do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:12:42 who hurt you
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:12:55 ok why are you so defensive about your build
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:13:10 good
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:13:51 you cant talk
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:14:02 you are one of the rare whitenames who have 100+ net downvotes on a build
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:14:43 idk, maybe u should play babft or something
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:15:30 ud get downvoted
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:15:32 but not as much as him
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:15:39 lupmotion is hopeless
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:15:47 u still have a chance
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:16:25 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:16:40 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:17:02 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:17:17 now look at this joke build
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:17:21 he will never touch this many upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:18:15 100 downvotes across 3 builds
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:18:20 see what i mean
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:18:23 you are still fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:18:51 im sure u have less ingame time than him
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:18:54 and still made something better
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:19:01 because the guy that made those planes is like 11
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:19:18 ok wtf
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:19:38 you cant be bothered learning magnetlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:19:40 but you have 65 days
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:19:44 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:20:06 he can still get expert
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:20:10 cos expert standards are pretty low
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:20:16 like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:20:24 3/4s of the experts dont even deserve the role
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:21:28 2020
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:21:30 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:21:45 still higher upvote ratio than that kids crappy planes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:22:36 looking back
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:22:37 pretty shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:22:47 ^my a10 not yours
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:23:08 but in 2020 motorlock wasnt a big thing yet
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:23:13 so i dont think i couldve done too much else
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:23:17 yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:23:39 i might remake my a10 in a few months
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:14 why one wide
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:26 one wide isnt even roscale™
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:39 idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:40 pontoons
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:42 and angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:24:48 i'd *assume*
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:25:03 dont cam lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:25:08 cam lock is just worse angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:25:11 every good player here hates camlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:26:15 picking camlock over anglelock doesnt make sense
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:26:30 unless you are in a very niche situation
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:26:45 because anglelock actually saves
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:26:54 and can be made more reliable
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:28:21 hi
general 2023-03-23 03:30:22 happy 12th birthday 11 year old

general 2023-03-23 05:02:26 not 100m
general 2023-03-23 05:02:31 but possible to damage people
general 2023-03-23 05:02:46 i wouldnt expect full kills though

general 2023-03-25 13:20:46 and the us did fund the taliban before lol
general 2023-03-25 13:21:03 at least not directly funded
general 2023-03-25 13:21:06 but they still got US money
general 2023-03-25 13:21:14 wont be a big difference now
general 2023-03-25 13:21:25 esp because theres incentive to give them money
general 2023-03-25 13:21:30 we cant let them run around with a nuke
general 2023-03-25 13:21:44 and who knows, maybe economic support will actually stabilize the country

general 2023-03-25 13:22:11 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-03-25 13:22:44 but the taliban probably wont be able to do anything with 1 nuke anyway
general 2023-03-25 13:23:06 north korea has like 40-50
general 2023-03-25 13:23:14 and they know they'll get destroyed by every other country if they tried anything

general 2023-03-25 13:27:09 but all things considered thats a very fast response for war
general 2023-03-25 13:27:42 because even at defcon 1
general 2023-03-25 13:27:46 army still takes 6 hours to deploy
general 2023-03-25 13:27:54 so 30minutes for nuclear response pretty good

general 2023-03-26 07:19:35 clash royale chest
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:20:14 why do kids keep building maus
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:20:32 its a literal box that breaks bridges from being a useless hunk of metal
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:20:52 yea because you're a noob
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:21:02 every expert here has seen countless maus
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:21:05 and rattes
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:21:09 and they all look bad
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:21:12 go for a tiger or something
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:21:19 a tiger is still a box but looks cooler
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:06 well if you look in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:09 there are more maus' than tigers
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:11 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:33 and the reason why they are always built
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:35 is because it takes no skill
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:40 and still the kids fuck up the build
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:22:42 somehow, idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:23:09 the hull, even with proper proportions looks stupid
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:23:55 where is the skill needed for this
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:01 its just a bunch of wedges at the front
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:02 and solid blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:12 the turret is the only spot where effort is required
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:22 lol?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:26 are you joking
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:44 no an actual ratte would need skill
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:49 because the deck has intricate details
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:24:54 and needs multiple turrets
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:25:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:25:27 but what the kids do is just put some motor 2 guns and pass them off as wirbelwind turrets on the ratte
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:25:40 which is why EVERY ratte in this server looks shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:25:45 there is no effort
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:14 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:14 they think their good just cos its a big build
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:24 are you blind
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:33 use your brain
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:34 
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:52 in comparison there is 130 tigers
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:55 so wtf are you on about
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:26:59 more tigers than maus my ass
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:27:43 i have never seen a good tiger
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:28:01 except for nightchaser's king tiger and the porsche tiger in hof
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:28:45 no wait there was another tiger 1
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:29:23 for 2020 standards this was glorious
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:29:29 shouldve been in hof
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:29:34 but the voters are dumbass 🤷
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:30:30 it still holds up well
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:30:51 better than most of the tanks being made today
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:31:09 they just do a bit of motorlock, maybe use some suspension and automatically think they're good or some shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:31:42 ive been working on my panzer iv for 2 months lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:31:58 havent even finished the hull
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:32:04 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:32:28 im already down to 500 something motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:32:54 yea cos they're lazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:04 the turret schurzen arent even sheet metal
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:08 for panzer iv hs
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:13 they just use half blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:15 and think thats good enough
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:36 idk im a slow builder by pcc standards
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:33:42 cos i dont play a lot

general 2023-04-02 01:15:02 do you really want 10 pings all at once
general 2023-04-02 01:15:28 and radar is not useful anyway since people have 360 vision
general 2023-04-02 01:15:47 plus useless in nonpvp
general 2023-04-02 01:15:54 as if it wasnt useless already in pvp
general 2023-04-02 01:16:09 radar doesnt make pvp fun
general 2023-04-02 01:16:21 how does it
general 2023-04-02 01:16:27 you’re the one suggesting it
general 2023-04-02 01:16:32 you make the case, not me
general 2023-04-02 01:17:10 ok gold bars added a new feature

general 2023-04-02 01:19:11 theres no point in pvp
general 2023-04-02 01:19:23 because you can already see motor2s missiles coming to u
general 2023-04-02 01:19:42 literally just turn your camera around
general 2023-04-02 01:19:46 and you can use your eyes
general 2023-04-02 01:19:53 wtf
general 2023-04-02 01:20:20 ok we still dont need radar because fire and forget missiles can exist without them
general 2023-04-02 01:20:31 rickje already made tracking rockets
general 2023-04-02 01:20:48 ok but this has nothing to do with radar
general 2023-04-02 01:21:15 only u think it is

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

general 2023-04-08 09:58:33 i've played a lot on roblox and off roblox
general 2023-04-08 09:58:53 i can tell u that a player who has grinded in an fps game will almost always beat a new player of equal skill
general 2023-04-08 09:59:14 yea but cs is old
general 2023-04-08 09:59:24 cs 2 is just a megaupdate

bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:44:01 hover engine shouldnt even be a thing
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:44:06 i hope it gets patched in pc2
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:50:18 what are you getting at
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:50:55 1 brought a new dimension of gameplay to plane crazy
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:50:59 the other is abused for pvp
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:51:02 ???
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:51:38 yea but some people here might think u are
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:51:47 and believe that hover drives should be a thing
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:51:55 when that, conveyer drives and magnet drives can go to hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 08:53:20 imagine trying to lecture hof entrant about game mechanics

bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:54:56 weight management? distributing volume? nah fuck that we got glitch drives!!
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:55:24 rick could incorporate a legit version of a drive
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:55:35 but only have a limited amount
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:56:01 a nerfed version
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:56:11 because the whitenames will cry if they get deleted perm
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:56:18 yea theres no point in that
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:57:02 well, i suppose you can say it has pvp uses
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:57:05 but it lowers skill ceiling even more
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:57:27 yea should be like a 3x2 block or something
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:57:49 because namnam jets going at 3k speed arent fun to fight in pvp
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:58:00 worse than shredders
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:58:21 idk we'll see
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:58:28 cos pc2 might revamp heli flight mechanics
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:59:06 or
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:59:11 if rick gave motors acceleration in pc2
bug-reports 2023-04-14 08:59:14 wouldnt even need engines to power rotos
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:00:23 hope tnt armor gets fucked over in pc2 too
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:00:30 its useless idk why whitenames bother lol

bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:02:42 yea
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:02:45 and pvp needs a complete rework
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:03:37 there needs to be real tradeoffs for spamming 4 fireworks, 10 guns and 12 rockets
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:04:07 yea cos lag
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:04:18 but thats not a real tradeoff
bug-reports 2023-04-14 09:04:40 its just the game being barely playable cos physics throttle

general 2023-04-16 12:43:47 since when did ukraine turn their backs on russia lol
general 2023-04-16 12:43:52 russia was rigging ukrainian elections before 2014
general 2023-04-16 12:44:18 and provided paratroopers to the dpr and lpr when they fought for independence
general 2023-04-16 12:44:28 and what  factored into the split was the botched elections too
general 2023-04-16 12:44:50 ukraine was still apprehensive about nato until russia started interfering lol

creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:11:57 that "bullshit" you found funny enough to repost lol
it was a plane crazy build so you had no right to repost that in <#384025409945337856> 
you have no right to dish out mega downvotes either because you're still a whitename
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:14:38 everyone already knew how shit his builds were. my mega downvote was a joke but it was ultimately a plane crazy build so you should be blacklisted just for reposting it.

btw, you dont just repeat what was said a couple hours ago and expect it to be funnier.
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:16:53 i already got the unde kicked from this server
there was nothing more to gain from reposting my creations.

edit: who the fuck said you can't have an opinion, you just cant repost someone else's shit in <#384025409945337856> when they're supposed to be your own. i dont understand what mental gymnastics you are playing at

you have no reason to be so obviously mad on a virtual text chat lmao

literally calm down this had nothing to do with you to start with
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:48:59 this shitty server is funny. dont know how im sooking over a false warn, but a mods issued the wrong reason for it + another said the meme was fine🤷‍♂️ 
you dont really have a say in this unless you're a mod too
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:51:03 one message is considered crying now guys. bravo, a great master of taking things out of context.

<@874912257128136734> "chronically online" as if you dont have 20k more messages than me here LMFAO. theres no way you are not being ironic
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:54:27 that's what it seemed like 🤷‍♂️ , not as farfetched of an assumption as yours

<@874912257128136734> yeah keep pulling stuff out of your arse because you're at a loss now. im just here enjoying my dinner before i get back to more productive stuff lol. suggest you should do the same. by the way, don't act like you're much more wise and mature than the "kids" here when i assure you that a large chunk of us are older than you and only spend time here for entertainment purposes
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:56:29 to think this started over nothing is hilarious. classic PCC.

general 2023-04-20 15:12:36 looks like he had hard evidence of tortures in russian prisons before the war
general 2023-04-20 15:13:04 idk where the blackmailing story came from, no sources i find seem to suggest that
general 2023-04-20 15:14:25 but uh yea at this point further war crimes is irrelevent cos putin is already a wanted war criminal by the ICC
general 2023-04-20 15:16:27 thing is there hasnt been a war this large since vietnam
general 2023-04-20 15:18:47 in afghanistan the taliban killed 3/4 civillians
russia was also involved in iraq and syria so that doesnt matter
general 2023-04-20 15:19:58 not saying the US is the goodey two shoes its made out to be but its not as time concentrated as what is happening recently
general 2023-04-20 15:21:52 hiring literal criminals to fight a war doesnt look good for russia
general 2023-04-20 15:23:02 yes but you end up with shit like bucha

general 2023-04-20 15:25:45 either way bucha is an example
general 2023-04-20 15:25:54 because that cant be denied
general 2023-04-20 15:25:56 it did happen
general 2023-04-20 15:26:04 denying that is on par with denying the 6 million jews killed in ww2
general 2023-04-20 15:26:20 there might be some instances up for debate
general 2023-04-20 15:26:23 yes ukrainian propaganda exists
general 2023-04-20 15:26:28 but bucha isnt made up
general 2023-04-20 15:27:00 "Photos showed corpses of civilians, lined up with their hands bound behind their backs, shot at point-blank range, which ostensibly gave proof that summary executions had taken place."

general 2023-04-26 13:58:12 i always clip stuff in hll cos its funny
general 2023-04-26 13:58:31 or to flex those sick plays
general 2023-04-26 13:58:45 (me spawnkilling the enemy commander)
general 2023-04-26 14:00:54 the tiger vision port is one of the best ones
general 2023-04-26 14:00:56 what u on about
general 2023-04-26 14:01:08 just wait till u drive a t34
general 2023-04-26 14:01:33 i dont drive soviet tanks
general 2023-04-26 14:01:36 cos the sights are DOGSHIT
general 2023-04-26 14:01:39 i cant see
general 2023-04-26 14:02:00 dude i dont think they even have glass
general 2023-04-26 14:02:06 none of them do if im not wrong
general 2023-04-26 14:05:16 i dont have stuff on tiger but puma vision slit like this
general 2023-04-26 14:05:35 i think its wider than tiger but a bit
general 2023-04-26 14:05:54 but in terms of height tiger is bigger
general 2023-04-26 14:06:33 and this was an IS1 we killed
general 2023-04-26 14:06:42 5 shots in the back, so the hll damage model is pretty stupid
general 2023-04-26 14:07:43 nah theyre all shit
general 2023-04-26 14:07:55 post scriptum seemed pretty good but I think their community had some issues with the devs too
general 2023-04-26 14:08:03 OWI seems to be after money rn
general 2023-04-26 14:08:32 and team17 devs are just as incompetent as black matter devs for HLL
general 2023-04-26 14:08:39 as for gajin, everyone knows how bad they are lol
general 2023-04-26 14:09:30 idk
general 2023-04-26 14:09:53 but like
general 2023-04-26 14:10:01 the only good world war shooter is probably bf1 and thats it
general 2023-04-26 14:10:12 no one had an issue with it
general 2023-04-26 14:10:30 i really enjoyed the campaign too
general 2023-04-26 14:11:06 opening sequence was awesome because no one had plot armour
general 2023-04-26 14:11:11 you literally played to die
general 2023-04-26 14:11:29 and the harlem hellfighters was a really good example of representation
general 2023-04-26 14:12:34 racist
general 2023-04-26 14:12:35 😎
general 2023-04-26 14:13:35 the lawrence of arabia stuff was pretty mid though
general 2023-04-26 14:13:49 where the fuck did that woman come from lmao
general 2023-04-26 14:14:07 still better than the BFV ski mission
general 2023-04-26 14:14:20 where you play as some little girl somehow killing entire platoons of trained german soldiers
general 2023-04-26 14:14:42 plot armour at max level
general 2023-04-26 14:14:58 but i got to give them credit for not stooping to cod vanguard lows
general 2023-04-26 14:15:02 ww2 avengers lmfao
general 2023-04-26 14:15:47 fourth reich coming out of nowhere
general 2023-04-26 14:16:00 if i wanted that i wouldve played wolfenstein
general 2023-04-26 14:16:50 germany steals technology from a jewish secret society to defeat the allies
general 2023-04-26 14:17:22 like the plot actually makes more sense than cod vanguard
general 2023-04-26 14:18:46 the wolfenstein tie-in to doom is pretty neat too
general 2023-04-26 14:18:52 they take place in the same world
general 2023-04-26 14:19:20 it depends on the canon
general 2023-04-26 14:19:28 cos theres multiple "timelines" so to speak
general 2023-04-26 14:19:44 but the main character is related to doomguy
general 2023-04-26 14:20:14 yea but the doom stuff is irrelevant in wolfenstein
general 2023-04-26 14:20:30 that stuff comes a hundred years after iirc
general 2023-04-26 14:21:22 once u go into the rabbit hole it ties in pretty well
general 2023-04-26 14:21:27 better than any of the new shit COD puts out
general 2023-04-26 14:22:07 if only they remastered the old cod trilogy
general 2023-04-26 14:22:10 + WAW
general 2023-04-26 14:22:26 they would make a lot more money than from cod wwii and vanguard
general 2023-04-26 14:23:07 halo 3 remaster would be broken for 5 years after release
general 2023-04-26 14:23:16 *cough* MCC *cough*
general 2023-04-26 14:23:36 halo story is lovely
general 2023-04-26 14:23:42 i want to get into the forerunner saga books
general 2023-04-26 14:24:00 yea i've seen wh40k fanboys shit on halo for being weak
general 2023-04-26 14:24:04 when the forerunners would eat the imperium alive
general 2023-04-26 14:24:17 wh40k is cool
general 2023-04-26 14:24:19 but its so over the top
general 2023-04-26 14:24:26 and a lot of the fans have a case of edgy syndrome
general 2023-04-26 14:25:14 YEAH THATS COOL AND ALL BUT A SPACE MARINE CAN DO A TRIPLE BACKFLIP AND LAND A WHOLE BOLTER MAGAZINE WITH PERFECT AIM
general 2023-04-26 14:25:45 they look out of scale
general 2023-04-26 14:25:54 but when you realise they're genetically engineered to be bigger than usual humans it makes sense
general 2023-04-26 14:26:13 some space marine designs are awesome
general 2023-04-26 14:26:18 unlike starcraft
general 2023-04-26 14:26:21 🤮
general 2023-04-26 14:26:35 scifi rts game
general 2023-04-26 14:26:42 one of the big ones back in the day
general 2023-04-26 14:27:14 redundancy
general 2023-04-26 14:27:26 they still fight hard with missing limbs
general 2023-04-26 14:28:27 i like how all wh40k ships look the same
general 2023-04-26 14:28:40 dude its like the halo frigates all over again
general 2023-04-26 14:29:40 funny thing is
general 2023-04-26 14:29:54 they can do this but cant give commissars and guard captains proper body armour
general 2023-04-26 14:30:00 sku
general 2023-04-26 14:30:31 no lots of wh40k fans are sexist
general 2023-04-26 14:30:51 they didnt like sisters of battle making too many appearances
general 2023-04-26 14:31:01 thought it was some sjw agenda
general 2023-04-26 14:31:48 theyre all weird
general 2023-04-26 14:31:55 mommy hadron
general 2023-04-26 14:33:17 if you go into debating forums
general 2023-04-26 14:33:42 they like to exaggerate wh40k faction strengths and think its a better universe just because it can beat other scifi factions
general 2023-04-26 14:33:51 its funny if u take a dive in
general 2023-04-26 14:33:59 ive seen them get shitted on so hard
general 2023-04-26 14:34:17 fair
general 2023-04-26 14:34:27 they tend to write entire essays on why 1 character will beat another character
general 2023-04-26 14:34:45 they shouldve touched grass instead lo
general 2023-04-26 14:35:03 the imperial guard
general 2023-04-26 14:35:21 trillions of them iirc, millions dying per day is pretty normal
general 2023-04-26 14:35:33 russia:
general 2023-04-26 14:35:54 i mean they have the entire galaxy
general 2023-04-26 14:36:22 their citizens are stuck in a dictatorship
general 2023-04-26 14:36:56 they need morale or the religious zealots will harass them
general 2023-04-26 14:37:01 for the god emperor and all that blah blah blah
general 2023-04-26 14:37:42 xeelee sequence seems like an interesting scifi series
general 2023-04-26 14:37:55 no
general 2023-04-26 14:38:46 a god-like alien civilisation fights what's basically a time war to prevent the universe from being consumed by time travelling dark matter creatures
general 2023-04-26 14:38:57 how would i know
general 2023-04-26 14:39:08 from what i heard it isnt
general 2023-04-26 14:39:19 dude i skipped out on 10th grade shit
general 2023-04-26 14:40:18 no
general 2023-04-26 14:40:48 its on par with doctor who edge
general 2023-04-26 14:40:52 which isnt that edgy tbh
general 2023-04-26 14:41:10 doctor who is a show
general 2023-04-26 14:41:24 but there are novels and the xeelee sequence author wrote for doctor who i think
general 2023-04-26 14:41:41 what the
general 2023-04-26 14:41:47 pretty cheesy
general 2023-04-26 14:41:49 but the story is alr
general 2023-04-26 14:42:07 you can really tell its dated when u watch it lol
general 2023-04-26 14:42:21 the lore iceberg is cool
general 2023-04-26 14:42:25 but the show sometimes looks like shit
general 2023-04-26 14:43:20 scifi a bit too overrated now though
general 2023-04-26 14:43:38 ive started getting into fantasy a bit more
general 2023-04-26 14:44:30 yea
general 2023-04-26 14:44:48 btw if portal 3 comes out i hope it ties into half life
general 2023-04-26 14:45:12 its not really evident in the games though
general 2023-04-26 14:45:21 theres only 1 mention of black mesa iirc
general 2023-04-26 14:45:40 man gordon freeman plot armour is so thick
general 2023-04-26 14:46:02 since when
general 2023-04-26 14:46:08 wasnt this a storyboard for a future half life agme
general 2023-04-26 14:47:15 asoiaf seems interesting if u want to dive into that
general 2023-04-26 14:47:29 the books game of thrones is based on
general 2023-04-26 14:47:38 why
general 2023-04-26 14:47:43 it was good until mid season
general 2023-04-26 14:48:14 yea some of the fans were stupid
general 2023-04-26 14:48:22 but they left since the ending was even dumber
general 2023-04-26 14:48:32 the books arent finished
general 2023-04-26 14:48:36 so the showwriters had to make their own ending
general 2023-04-26 14:48:43 guess where that led them <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-04-26 14:49:09 but the game of thrones prequel is cool
general 2023-04-26 14:49:17 house of the dragon has less annoying fans
general 2023-04-26 14:50:04 he loves cp (civil protection)
general 2023-04-26 14:50:51 saw someone blasting that music in a pub server a few years ago
general 2023-04-26 14:50:58 he had a cool hunter chopper build from hl2
general 2023-04-26 14:51:36 kremlin music
general 2023-04-26 14:52:01 2a
general 2023-04-26 14:52:04 if it werent for the balancing issues
general 2023-04-26 14:52:24 2a has the sickass cutscenes
general 2023-04-26 14:52:43 playing arbiter was awesome too
general 2023-04-26 14:52:53 oh odst is prob my second favourite
general 2023-04-26 14:53:04 yea multiplayer is good
general 2023-04-26 14:53:12 but in terms of campaign i still rank 2 and ost above
general 2023-04-26 14:53:21 hes in a cave on reach
general 2023-04-26 14:53:23 dont worry
general 2023-04-26 14:53:26 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2023-04-26 14:53:51 the books arent canon for me
general 2023-04-26 14:54:02 well not that one
general 2023-04-26 14:54:29 because forerunner trilogy still gave a cool backstory to halo 4
general 2023-04-26 14:54:31 WHICH THEY SHOULDVE EXPLAINED IN THE GAME
general 2023-04-26 14:54:46 the story was ok
general 2023-04-26 14:54:50 but the gameplay was FAAAKED
general 2023-04-26 14:54:58 it was not fun on some levels
general 2023-04-26 14:55:01 like library-tier grinding
general 2023-04-26 14:55:14 the knights are bullet sponges and teleport around with revive capabilitie sfrom watchers
general 2023-04-26 14:55:16 they are annoying
general 2023-04-26 14:56:18 shut up shitmustard69
general 2023-04-26 14:56:58 dont say n
general 2023-04-26 14:57:24 then you look at forerunner ships
general 2023-04-26 14:57:29 💀
general 2023-04-26 14:57:47 to understand the didact you have to read the books
general 2023-04-26 14:58:11 he was driven to madness by the flood and was stuck in prison for 100k years
general 2023-04-26 14:58:17 i think everyone would go schizo
general 2023-04-26 14:58:42 the flood killed all his sons and daughters
general 2023-04-26 14:58:47 but then he takes his anger out on chief for some reason
general 2023-04-26 14:58:48 LO
general 2023-04-26 14:59:52 sorry not the flood, other ancient humans did
general 2023-04-26 14:59:58 in that case i think its pretty warranted lol
general 2023-04-26 15:00:09 theyre all BLACK
general 2023-04-26 15:00:28 what in the martin luther king jr ever loving kfc fuck is going on
general 2023-04-26 15:01:24 there's a wives tale of the prophecy of plane crazy 2
general 2023-04-26 15:01:29 obviously not real
general 2023-04-26 15:01:49 I HATE ISRAEL
general 2023-04-26 15:02:27 israeli soldiers after shooting the palestianian kid for stepping on 1m of their land:
general 2023-04-26 15:04:09 no they made spartan ivs look like power rangers

general 2023-04-26 15:15:54 geneva suggestion
general 2023-04-26 15:16:27 battle of agincourt
general 2023-04-26 15:16:33 funny fr*nch failure
general 2023-04-26 15:17:16 english KDR of french in that battle was 
10 french kills per 1 english loss
general 2023-04-26 15:17:18 the french are shit

general 2023-04-26 15:17:54 fr*nce on their way to surrender every war
general 2023-04-26 15:18:41 navies are gay but a fr*nch navy is the entire lgbt pride march
general 2023-04-26 15:19:14 marine corps showers:
general 2023-04-26 15:20:05 whats manlier than being surrounded by naked men
general 2023-04-26 15:20:41 the funny part was when ryan didnt want to go home
general 2023-04-26 15:20:46 so they did all that shit for no reason lmao
general 2023-04-26 15:21:53 spaghetti
general 2023-04-26 15:22:08 true
general 2023-04-26 15:23:02 french had a KDR of 0.5 at waterloo
general 2023-04-26 15:23:05 napoleon noob
general 2023-04-26 15:23:33 napoleon is considered good because he improved french kdr from medieval era
general 2023-04-26 15:23:37 (0.1 kdr)
general 2023-04-26 15:25:08 what
general 2023-04-26 15:25:22 you can bully the spanish royalty for inbreeding
general 2023-04-26 15:25:42 ptolemies were next level inbreeders
general 2023-04-26 15:25:45 like professional tier
general 2023-04-26 15:26:38 tutankhamun's whole family tree basically married siblings
general 2023-04-26 15:26:42 sounds like rickje is a descendant
general 2023-04-26 15:27:38 time for the british empire 2
general 2023-04-26 15:29:20 i hope commonwealth becomes the british empire 2
general 2023-04-26 15:30:06 if every commonwealth country united in a war they could take on any superpower and fuck them up
general 2023-04-26 15:31:12 british royalty try not to be nonces challenge (impossible)
general 2023-04-26 15:33:37 dont worry china's got you covered (global warming <:trollface:775024642104229898> )
general 2023-04-26 15:34:35 SS

general 2023-04-26 15:35:32 who she
general 2023-04-26 15:35:48 she looks like a dumbass with that anime pfp
general 2023-04-26 15:36:08 oh
general 2023-04-26 15:36:11 the lesbian
general 2023-04-26 15:36:18 i wish i didnt
general 2023-04-26 15:36:25 its like a cognitohazard dude
general 2023-04-26 15:36:32 mere knowledge makes you nauseus (i cant spell)
general 2023-04-26 15:36:56 because they like little teenage girls
general 2023-04-26 15:37:01 its not that complicated
general 2023-04-26 15:37:06 they are nonces on par with fuzzythefurry
general 2023-04-26 15:37:35 theyre the same people who play genshin impact
general 2023-04-26 15:37:39 and the scary thing is they have voting rights
general 2023-04-26 15:38:00 nah theres some good franchises that havent been fucked
general 2023-04-26 15:38:25 novel series tend to be pretty stable
general 2023-04-26 15:38:51 yeah thats why a lot of fantasy is regarded as pretty good
general 2023-04-26 15:39:07 because the people who wrote those books were genuinely good authors
general 2023-04-26 15:39:11 and had a vision
general 2023-04-26 15:40:10 are you insulting me
general 2023-04-26 15:40:18 but what
general 2023-04-26 15:40:27 what a loser
general 2023-04-26 15:40:52 throw him overboard
general 2023-04-26 15:41:17 what
general 2023-04-26 15:41:24 thats pretty good
general 2023-04-26 15:41:31 adf has good benefits
general 2023-04-26 15:41:36 and the navy patrols around antarctica
general 2023-04-26 15:41:41 its really good
general 2023-04-26 15:42:37 yea but for a country with a population as small as aus, the adf is more than enough

plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:30:21 its what the name suggests
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:30:49 the metal has oxides in it
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:30:57 alumina and yttria are oxides
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:31:28 they are nanoparticles
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:31:59 the subheading of that is literally called nanotechnology-aided reactor materials
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:32:06 why would it have no nanoparticles lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:32:16 sku
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:32:34 the base material wouldnt be a nanoparticle though
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:32:56 all metals need iron for example
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 12:33:17 iron is assembled into large lattices so they arent individual nanoparticles

general 2023-04-30 13:26:37 spend time here and you'll know more than you do now
general 2023-04-30 13:27:18 there isnt that many more muslims than christians

(other way around i cant english)
general 2023-04-30 13:27:25 wouldnt be fair to ask someone if they knew what the first page of the quran said
general 2023-04-30 13:29:00 yes but in a non-muslim majority country that's rare
general 2023-04-30 13:31:05 you wont find a guy who read the quran if you look around new york for 5 minutes
general 2023-04-30 13:32:31 ok what verses do you know about
general 2023-04-30 13:32:41 can you recite them off the top of your head
general 2023-04-30 13:33:30 ok so you learnt about it
general 2023-04-30 13:33:35 but didnt actually delve through the contents
general 2023-04-30 13:33:48 thats not the point we're discussing though
general 2023-04-30 13:34:15 if you didnt learn the contents of the quran
general 2023-04-30 13:34:16 you cannot answer this
general 2023-04-30 13:34:36 you may have some knowledge, but that doesnt mean you'll know
general 2023-04-30 13:34:40 however you said you would for some reason
general 2023-04-30 13:36:10 fuck tolerance
general 2023-04-30 13:36:12 i hate everyone
general 2023-04-30 13:38:18 wait so
general 2023-04-30 13:38:26 are middle eastern muslims criticising indonesian muslims
general 2023-04-30 13:40:10 loud explosions?
general 2023-04-30 13:42:16 LETS GO
general 2023-04-30 13:43:01 what sort of things are not humane
general 2023-04-30 13:44:42 so is this like sharia law
general 2023-04-30 13:44:57 so if im not wrong
general 2023-04-30 13:45:08 sharia law is like the christian equivalent of following ancient jewish laws right
general 2023-04-30 13:45:53 those were the romans
general 2023-04-30 13:46:34 yea the jews did make shit up to kill jesus
general 2023-04-30 13:46:37 i guess moustache man was avenging god
general 2023-04-30 13:48:11 ironically the bible was barely accessible
general 2023-04-30 13:48:19 yet still a lot of christians dont read their own book
general 2023-04-30 13:49:05 early christians took things most seriously
general 2023-04-30 13:49:17 medieval christians didnt even have bibles
general 2023-04-30 13:49:28 thats why the protestant reformation happened
general 2023-04-30 13:49:30 the church was corrupt
general 2023-04-30 13:49:58 pope leo x was basically freeranked too
general 2023-04-30 13:50:40 the inquisitions arent as bad as people make them out to be
general 2023-04-30 13:50:46 catholicism at least had a strict structure on rules for adherence
general 2023-04-30 13:50:51 despite corruption in the clergy
general 2023-04-30 13:51:35 a lot of the tribunals leading to executions weren't even held by the church
general 2023-04-30 13:51:40 they were state-related
general 2023-04-30 13:52:10 the church wasnt directly pulling strings
general 2023-04-30 13:54:18 also the spanish inquisition didnt subject anyone but christians to investigation
general 2023-04-30 13:54:29 iirc other religions were let off in christian lands
general 2023-04-30 13:58:27 whats your favourite race
general 2023-04-30 15:50:35 let them do it
general 2023-04-30 15:51:23 why would they kill themself over a class
general 2023-04-30 15:51:34 that doesnt make sense
general 2023-04-30 15:52:34 so not just failing a class
general 2023-04-30 15:54:01 you serve zero purpose
general 2023-04-30 15:54:08 you should krill yourshelf NOW

general 2023-05-02 08:27:23 he would crumble and cry trying to write a real essay
general 2023-05-02 08:30:12 the kid cant express any intelligible thought so feels the need to form a superiority complex on the basis of capitalisation. if it wants to act like an arrogant smartass the toad should do it properly
general 2023-05-02 08:32:58 probably some further incoherent babble, as expected from a toddler
general 2023-05-02 08:38:38 as the age old saying goes

general 2023-05-02 08:42:47 evidently his parents barely discipline him. based on the lack of attention he receives from family, the child is merely projecting the sad truth he isnt wanted.
general 2023-05-02 08:43:11 to put it nicely

general 2023-05-02 09:06:29 well I guess the reason why he attempts to disrupt gameplay is because hes too stupid to be able to put a build together himself
general 2023-05-02 09:06:42 dont see the kid building much outside of tutorials
general 2023-05-02 09:07:15 its just deep-seated jealousy and too much time on his hands

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:33:56 very rarily is not hiding a lock possible
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:34:38 more times than none it signifies that a person isnt attentive to their own build and doesnt care

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:22:06 magnetlock likes to kill itself a lot
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:22:11 at least in my experience
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:24:41 probably
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:25:02 its something that has building value without throwing a wrench in how people enjoy the game

general 2023-05-02 12:28:47 the fascism stuff isnt really valid though
general 2023-05-02 12:28:52 slavic countries tend to have that issue for some reason
general 2023-05-02 12:29:19 russia cant invade ukraine for de-moustachification if they have neo-moustachemanners of their own

general 2023-05-02 13:03:05 not that we needed to know anyway cos its a bit weird to talk about these things on a lego plane server with a lot of undes
general 2023-05-02 13:03:18 thats why it comes off as a flex lol
general 2023-05-02 13:03:21 it gets mentioned out of the blue
general 2023-05-02 13:04:41 we intentionally set fire to bushland anyway
general 2023-05-02 13:05:00 its backburning
general 2023-05-02 13:06:54 Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.

general 2023-05-02 13:41:33 what are you majoring in physics for
general 2023-05-02 13:44:31 since when did the vatican fast on sabbath lol
general 2023-05-02 13:45:56 weird shit but whatever
general 2023-05-02 13:45:59 the fast is on lent
general 2023-05-02 13:46:04 not all christians fast at all
general 2023-05-02 13:46:11 and some catholics fast only on a few days of lent
general 2023-05-02 13:46:31 
general 2023-05-02 13:46:32 part of the church calender
general 2023-05-02 13:46:58 i dont know a single person who fasts for the entire 40 days
general 2023-05-02 13:47:05 usually its just for the first and last days of those 40
general 2023-05-02 13:48:22 who is "they"
general 2023-05-02 13:49:08 the jews are so holy they fasted on their summer camp
general 2023-05-02 13:49:52 depends on the christian tradition
general 2023-05-02 13:50:24 in protestantism fasting for lent isnt necessary
general 2023-05-02 13:50:33 but its a point of contention amongst denominations
general 2023-05-02 13:50:56 protestants are christians
general 2023-05-02 13:51:26 yes think of it this way
general 2023-05-02 13:51:35 islam has shia and sunni branches right
general 2023-05-02 13:51:49 christianity has similar thing in that theres multiple denominations
general 2023-05-02 13:51:57 ultimately all christians follow the same fundamental beliefs
general 2023-05-02 13:52:16 prysbeterians are a type of protestant denomination
general 2023-05-02 13:52:27 he oversimplifies a lot of shit and leaves out some others
general 2023-05-02 13:52:30 ive seen the video
general 2023-05-02 13:52:42 he doesnt talk about how the lutherans were the original protestants
general 2023-05-02 13:52:59 who believe in sola fide, sola gratia and sola scriptura
general 2023-05-02 13:53:07 faith alone, grace alone, scripture alone
general 2023-05-02 13:53:16 protestants dont believe in the authority of the catholic church
general 2023-05-02 13:53:25 which catholicism maintains to be the "one holy catholic and apostolic church"
general 2023-05-02 13:53:39 no
general 2023-05-02 13:53:43 king henry wasnt even born yet
general 2023-05-02 13:53:52 king henry formed the anglican denomination
general 2023-05-02 13:54:01 anglicans fall under the protestants
general 2023-05-02 13:54:19 protestantism is a broad term for christian traditions that aren't catholic or orthodox
general 2023-05-02 13:54:32 the difference between catholicism and orthodox is mainly political
general 2023-05-02 13:54:37 but there are some negligible nuances
general 2023-05-02 13:54:56 not necessarily
general 2023-05-02 13:55:03 a lot of protestant denominations lean very heavily towards cultism
general 2023-05-02 13:55:18 the mormons, church of LDS and seventh day adventists barely qualify as christian
general 2023-05-02 13:55:22 i would argue they arent at all
general 2023-05-02 13:55:59 they are heavily fundamentalist and like to take biblical concepts, maintained as true for 2 millenia by every other denomination, and twists it to their own accord
general 2023-05-02 13:56:08 same goes for jehovas witnesses
general 2023-05-02 13:56:16 yes its heresy
general 2023-05-02 13:56:22 they are heretical
general 2023-05-02 13:56:24 im not afraid to say that
general 2023-05-02 13:57:00 mainstream protestantism in general is not that hostile towards catholicism nowadays
general 2023-05-02 13:57:03 vice versa
general 2023-05-02 13:57:26 protestantism began when a priest named Martin Luther (not the black guy) publicised what is known as the 95 thesis
general 2023-05-02 13:58:01 this was in 1517, and the catholic church did engage in a debate against his ideas which outlined church corruption and contradictions of biblical concepts
general 2023-05-02 13:58:48 lutherism was the first protestant denomination
general 2023-05-02 13:58:54 but i dont agree with his ideas because they contradict the bible also
general 2023-05-02 13:59:02 ironic, considering thats what he didn't like catholicism for
general 2023-05-02 13:59:26 faith by grace alone, he says, meanwhile Jas 2:26 suggests "faith without works is dead"
general 2023-05-02 13:59:48 Jas is the book of james, and since it contradicted with Luther he stated that one should "throw Jimmy into the fire"
general 2023-05-02 14:00:00 evolution
general 2023-05-02 14:00:13 Luther was right on many things
general 2023-05-02 14:00:24 the catholic church did make amends when they read his 95 thesis
general 2023-05-02 14:00:36 the priests were corrupt and they did sell prayer services
general 2023-05-02 14:00:59 yes catholicism improved drastically because the existence of a united christianity hinged upon it improving
general 2023-05-02 14:01:08 they failed. protestantism still came to fruition.
general 2023-05-02 14:01:47 lutherism is protestant
general 2023-05-02 14:01:52 but protestant is not lutherism
general 2023-05-02 14:02:08 there were other protestant denominations that formed after luther initiated a split
general 2023-05-02 14:03:12 now the thing is
general 2023-05-02 14:03:27 christianity isnt disconcerted because of the various denominations
general 2023-05-02 14:03:51 in general its held that a faith in christ and following his values (which MANY christians value to do cos they dont read the bible) is key to salvation
general 2023-05-02 14:03:59 catholicism
general 2023-05-02 14:04:29 because christianity comprises 2 bill people though
general 2023-05-02 14:04:42 a lot of them like to make bullshit up and it ends up affecting its outward appearance
general 2023-05-02 14:05:44 beliefs on par with white jesus being armed with 2 ar15s who led a holy war against the jews in 0AD
general 2023-05-02 14:06:34 and some denominations see it as their duty to spread the word of god, even though it ends up being bloody annoying
general 2023-05-02 14:06:41 *fucking jehovas witnesses*
general 2023-05-02 14:07:02 some denominations did become obsolete
general 2023-05-02 14:07:13 while some just became so cultish they got fucked
general 2023-05-02 14:07:30 ironically christ was against cults
general 2023-05-02 14:08:30 now between denominations there are some differences between belief and traditions
general 2023-05-02 14:09:07 no, just the most outlandish denominations that hijacked christianity for a man to personal gains
general 2023-05-02 14:09:12 this still does exist today
general 2023-05-02 14:09:16 kenneth copeland is a heretic
general 2023-05-02 14:10:02 its funny jesus warned against assholes like him that'd try to pretend to be prophets of god
general 2023-05-02 14:10:11 when in reality hes (kenneth) just sapping the wealth of his followers
general 2023-05-02 14:11:49 excessively affluent lifestyles like him is opposed by the whole bible lol
general 2023-05-02 14:12:01 you can find countless quotes that counter "prosperity theology"
general 2023-05-02 14:12:38 the bible is not as conservative as some people think
general 2023-05-02 14:12:51 sure it has some questionable material but its pretty forward thinking
general 2023-05-02 14:13:19 yes and its cited that followers will inherit wealth in heaven
general 2023-05-02 14:13:33 could you be rewarded on earth? absolutely thats what christians believe
general 2023-05-02 14:13:42 but prosperity theology is an amalgamation in the worst way possible
general 2023-05-02 14:13:48 designed to scam gullible christians of their money
general 2023-05-02 14:14:19 prosperity theology likes to refer to the story of job
general 2023-05-02 14:14:42 however job had his shit taken from him due to unnatural intervention
general 2023-05-02 14:14:53 it only makes sense for his shit to be restored with divine intervention
general 2023-05-02 14:15:49 now suck my tongue 😝

general 2023-05-03 13:06:55 are you suggesting the gas tank would get crushed
general 2023-05-03 13:07:13 shut the fuck up
general 2023-05-03 13:07:16 im asking a question
general 2023-05-03 13:07:36 ok smartass
general 2023-05-03 13:08:42 do you have a derivation for the force on the gas tank
general 2023-05-03 13:08:52 because vacuum chambers exist and they still dont get crushed
general 2023-05-03 13:09:17 im asking for numbers
general 2023-05-03 13:09:29 math
general 2023-05-03 13:09:44 because the way you prove things in physics is math
general 2023-05-03 13:11:51 apparently 1 atm exerts 1.45N/cm^2
general 2023-05-03 13:12:06 human punching force is 2500N
general 2023-05-03 13:12:09 waddafaq bro
general 2023-05-03 13:12:46 you have more chance of crushing a gas tank by punching it than depressurisation
general 2023-05-03 13:12:47 💀
general 2023-05-03 13:12:54 "Punching forces in amateur boxing are around 2500 N."
general 2023-05-03 13:13:18 so punchers with good form
general 2023-05-03 13:13:20 but lack of experience
general 2023-05-03 13:18:02 ok still
"The average force of a boxer’s punch is around 770 psi (pounds per square inch)"
530.9 N/cm^2
equivalent to 52atm lol
general 2023-05-03 13:19:29 where the fuck is your equation then
general 2023-05-03 13:19:49 TOO BAD

general 2023-05-03 13:22:15 and i know air pressure can crush stuff how tf it crushing gas containers though
general 2023-05-03 13:23:21 yes but what about vacuum chambers
general 2023-05-03 13:23:42 they should get crushed too but the material can resist the force
general 2023-05-03 13:24:03 so how does gas container get crushed if a lot of them are made of metal

plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:18:44 you can be gay if you are communist
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:18:50 and supporting the ideology makes you support a gay ideology

plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:20:43 get a load of this guy
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:21:06 meanwhile democracy is the most stable form of government we can think of
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:21:15 and has roots in the roman republic which is the most successful society in antiquity
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:25:59 true

plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:27:56 socialism isnt communism though
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:28:05 and a lot of first world countries adopt socialist ideals because it actually works
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:28:07 unlike communism
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:28:08 🤣
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:31:32 ironically there was more poverty in the soviet union than the USA lmao
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:31:38 gdp in 1990 was over 5x higher
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:33:17 not how it works in a communist country tho
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:33:25 the economy is regulated centrally
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:33:30 and a central government already defeats the point of communism lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:37:40 yes but we're talking about inflation
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:37:45 the soviet union never had a strong economy to start with
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:37:56 but inflation isnt as much of an impact in communist countries than it is in capitalist nations
plane-crazy 2023-05-06 12:41:29 have you considered that its probably because plane crazy is dogshit

general 2023-05-07 11:07:27 ok you are just 13 right
general 2023-05-07 11:07:28 thats ok
general 2023-05-07 11:07:38 yes, no?
general 2023-05-07 11:08:01 hey dude answer my question
general 2023-05-07 11:08:04 its just a 1 word answer
general 2023-05-07 11:08:08 not hard
general 2023-05-07 11:08:24 people just think you're unde because of the way you speak
general 2023-05-07 11:08:29 just say how old you actually are
general 2023-05-07 11:08:35 don't give that "13+" crap, give an actual age
general 2023-05-07 11:08:40 and everyone will leave you
general 2023-05-07 11:09:20 u shouldnt
general 2023-05-07 11:09:27 thats the issue because discord doesnt allow undes
general 2023-05-07 11:09:37 in that case ur better off leaving and rejoining when ur older
general 2023-05-07 11:10:00 so are you going to give an actual age that isnt unde
general 2023-05-07 11:10:06 or do you have to be embarrassed into leaving
general 2023-05-07 11:10:23 no it isnt
general 2023-05-07 11:10:34 you literally reveal your age to discord when you make your account by setting the birth date
general 2023-05-07 11:10:43 i dont think you understand how the tos works
general 2023-05-07 11:11:04 whats so hard with giving an age
general 2023-05-07 11:11:11 1 number, then everyone leaves you alone
general 2023-05-07 11:11:29 we're not even asking for id
general 2023-05-07 11:11:56 saying "13+" is the most common response from people that aren't actually 13+
general 2023-05-07 11:12:18 the mods do jack shit

general 2023-05-07 11:34:37 its not a good idea to play any game based on a franchise lol
general 2023-05-07 11:34:38 theyre all shit
general 2023-05-07 11:35:02 except delta ring
general 2023-05-07 11:35:04 😎
general 2023-05-07 11:35:29 delta ring is literally halo 5 pvp
general 2023-05-07 11:35:40 and is actually good
general 2023-05-07 11:35:52 more fun than pf and arsenal
general 2023-05-07 11:35:58 because it requires actual skill
general 2023-05-07 11:36:25 true, guess the bar isnt really that high
general 2023-05-07 11:36:35 lol pf < arsenal
general 2023-05-07 11:37:03 arsenal has everything that makes the game fun but throws it away completely
general 2023-05-07 11:37:08 pf is just dogshit
general 2023-05-07 11:37:09 lol
general 2023-05-07 11:37:26 i dont even have to explain why pf is bad
general 2023-05-07 11:37:47 yea cos the bloxys dont even take into account gameplay
general 2023-05-07 11:37:52 its a popularity contest
general 2023-05-07 11:37:57 and kids like pf because its point and click
general 2023-05-07 11:38:40 im not saying arsenal isnt point and click
general 2023-05-07 11:38:47 pf has less gameplay variety so its not as fun
general 2023-05-07 11:38:59 plus less optimized and has the same exploiter inundation as arsenal
general 2023-05-07 11:39:37 arsenal weapons actually feel diverse, as stupid as the guns may be
general 2023-05-07 11:39:42 in pf every gun feels like a reskin
general 2023-05-07 11:39:51 and the ones that arent are locked behind a grindwall
general 2023-05-07 11:39:55 and will smash default weapons
general 2023-05-07 11:40:34 not to mention the pf attachment system is just fake complexity
general 2023-05-07 11:40:47 i've had experience with pf before it was even released
general 2023-05-07 11:40:53 i have the veteran title
general 2023-05-07 11:41:06 im telling u now
general 2023-05-07 11:41:15 pf in 2015 is literally better than the state of the game now lol
general 2023-05-07 11:41:45 pf hasnt had any major steps in innovation
general 2023-05-07 11:41:53 there was a time where they intended on adding wall breaching charges
general 2023-05-07 11:41:57 and other meta shifting weapons
general 2023-05-07 11:42:04 where's that now?
general 2023-05-07 11:42:13 maybe not
general 2023-05-07 11:42:32 but instead of introducing real features into pf
general 2023-05-07 11:42:35 they add anime sights
general 2023-05-07 11:42:38 🤯
general 2023-05-07 11:43:03 i dont think it wouldve turned the game into r6s imo
general 2023-05-07 11:43:16 more like bf3/bf4, which is what is the main inspiration behind pf anyway
general 2023-05-07 11:43:37 except they somehow managed to take the good aspects from battlefield and turn them into amalgamations
general 2023-05-07 11:44:00 in terms of innovation
general 2023-05-07 11:44:08 arsenal has had far more distinctive gamemodes than pf
general 2023-05-07 11:44:13 and unique weaponry
general 2023-05-07 11:44:25 but because of the way the game is, cant really add more
general 2023-05-07 11:44:30 its literally a roblox port of a csgo mod
general 2023-05-07 11:44:39 while pf is inspired by battlefield entirely
general 2023-05-07 11:45:07 closer to bf
general 2023-05-07 11:45:23 no it wasnt
general 2023-05-07 11:45:27 call of robloxia was a separate game
general 2023-05-07 11:45:30 ive played that too
general 2023-05-07 11:45:58 also arsenal ttk is just fine
general 2023-05-07 11:46:36 whats more annoying is pf instakills from out of line of sight because of the shitty networking optimization
general 2023-05-07 11:47:27 elaborate
general 2023-05-07 11:52:58 pf ttk is annoying lool
general 2023-05-07 11:53:06 its not really consistent
general 2023-05-07 11:53:10 some weapons are like peashooters
general 2023-05-07 11:53:28 others are the equivalent of a 50 cal

creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:04:23 a lot of it is an overblown meme lol, ppl just like to joke about 1 exposed motorlock getting you 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:07:14 but while basically the entire server can ignore a couple sparse exposed locks, it really detracts from the actual build if you have too many. it highlights a lazy builder who hasnt bothered to polish their own build. 

the "EXPOSE MOTOLOK!1!!1 ZOMG" joke comes children thinking people hate their build solely for the locks when, as a matter of fact, theyre just aesthetically displeasing entirely
general 2023-05-11 13:07:50 a steam game is better than roblox
general 2023-05-11 13:07:52 wow really
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:10:47 no <#384025409945337856> doesn't really care about PVP function unless its a groundbreaking innovation. PCC cares more about looks than anything
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:13:15 adding onto that,
yes pvp has to be sacrificed for appearance, but a skilled player can make the tradeoff negligible. that's what PCC wants to see - a well rounded build that has had a lot of thought and effort put into it.
the-dump 2023-05-11 13:15:56 at least she honest

general 2023-05-11 13:18:48 lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-11 13:19:42 its a joke dude
general 2023-05-11 13:20:43 because roblox enjoys taking IDs from minors
general 2023-05-11 13:21:14 their whole shtick is exploiting children
general 2023-05-11 13:21:32 been like that ever since halfway last decade
general 2023-05-11 13:21:47 they dont get sued
general 2023-05-11 13:21:54 they sue people instead with blatantly losing lawsuits
general 2023-05-11 13:22:08 to drown the defendant in court costs
general 2023-05-11 13:22:37 ?
general 2023-05-11 13:23:38 https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/class-action-lawsuit-brought-against-roblox-over-suspected-content-deleting-scheme/

lawsuit went nowhere lol
general 2023-05-11 13:24:16 probably
general 2023-05-11 13:24:24 but roblox loses barely anything
general 2023-05-11 13:24:40 while roblox can pursue content creators who criticise the platform
general 2023-05-11 13:25:00 the intent isnt to win
general 2023-05-11 13:25:07 the intent is to financially cripple the defendant
general 2023-05-11 13:25:11 its a scummy practise
general 2023-05-11 13:26:20 as i was saying, you're pitting a billion dollar company against an individual who has to defend themselves from a high-level legal team
general 2023-05-11 13:26:48 yes but that was the intent
general 2023-05-11 13:27:06 obviously roblox isnt motivated by a force for good
general 2023-05-11 13:27:13 so
general 2023-05-11 13:27:26 just because they won't win doesn't make roblox any more ethical
general 2023-05-11 13:27:44 an attempted murderer isn't good because they failed to murder someone
general 2023-05-11 13:28:05 roblox is a shitty company

general 2023-05-13 02:28:50 they dont care about your point of view
general 2023-05-13 02:29:05 the point of an argument/debate is to convince the opponent to be on terms with you

general 2023-05-19 12:20:28 but then the whitenames will start crying about "gatekeeping"
general 2023-05-19 12:20:35 even though its just keeping the channel clean
general 2023-05-19 12:20:48 nah
general 2023-05-19 12:20:54 rank 1 is enough to filter out most of the bad stuff
general 2023-05-19 12:21:20 because a lot of the time, whitenames just post their first creation without putting into thought into it
general 2023-05-19 12:21:33 getting at least rank 1 forces them to think about their build
general 2023-05-19 12:22:09 already more effort for them than they usually put in lol
general 2023-05-19 12:22:47 and shit like this wouldnt meet rank 1 blockcount anyway
general 2023-05-19 12:26:21 no good multicrew tank games
general 2023-05-19 12:26:22 😭
general 2023-05-19 12:27:02 maybe squad and post scriptum but thats it
general 2023-05-19 12:27:10 not even hll has good multicrew tank system
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 12:51:42 why ask for feedback when you won't even tell us what it is

general 2023-05-21 07:16:13 so kind
general 2023-05-21 07:20:40 no
general 2023-05-21 07:20:49 lowers skill ceiling immensely
general 2023-05-21 07:20:59 you'll start seeing top notch pvp builds everywhere in pc2
general 2023-05-21 07:22:28 i dont want to see a group of kids using the same OP jet to spawnkill the whole server
general 2023-05-21 07:22:33 no skill
general 2023-05-21 07:22:45 at least allow sharing builds under certain block limit
general 2023-05-21 07:23:31 like sharing anything under 200 blocks im fine with
general 2023-05-21 07:24:15 phantom forces esp
general 2023-05-21 07:24:16 🤣
general 2023-05-21 07:24:20 cant believe that still exists
general 2023-05-21 07:24:28 devs more absentminded than rickje
general 2023-05-21 07:24:43 pc2 more optimized
general 2023-05-21 07:24:57 you'll be able to run actual tank tracks without getting physics throttled to 10%
general 2023-05-21 07:27:05 reminds me
general 2023-05-21 07:27:12 we need new ways to fight in pvp
general 2023-05-21 07:27:31 no way
general 2023-05-21 07:27:44 no lol
general 2023-05-21 07:27:51 blimp is complete opposite of meta
general 2023-05-21 07:27:56 you are asking to get shreddered
general 2023-05-21 07:28:17 it wont
general 2023-05-21 07:28:55 the only good pvp builds rn are either the gamebreaking builds (axis lock and the like)
general 2023-05-21 07:28:56 or namnam jets
general 2023-05-21 07:29:32 there is no incentive to use any other weapon than guns and rockets
general 2023-05-21 07:29:50 fireworks are ok but they will literally blow yourself up
general 2023-05-21 07:29:53 if physics lag
general 2023-05-21 07:31:04 i hope waterjet gets buffed
general 2023-05-21 07:31:29 range is so laughably small that you cant even make a firehose
general 2023-05-21 07:31:44 thats the issue
general 2023-05-21 07:31:47 its so useless
general 2023-05-21 07:31:59 it might as well be removed from the pvp section

general 2023-05-21 07:36:01 no one wants to play this shit anymore
general 2023-05-21 07:36:09 half the experts just hang around in pcc without playing the game
general 2023-05-21 07:38:53 cos the dev pays more attention to its fanbase than rickje
general 2023-05-21 07:39:46 a 13 year old getting more praise for basic transparency is an embarrassment to pcc’s development updates
general 2023-05-21 07:40:08 or 14, he sounds the same lol
general 2023-05-21 07:41:16 pc2 has quite the potential to flop
general 2023-05-21 07:41:32 rick hasnt asked the community for input besides train track width
general 2023-05-21 07:41:58 i hope he addresses pvp
general 2023-05-21 07:42:06 because thats one of the worst aspects of pc atm
general 2023-05-21 07:43:53 pvp is bad because its literally an afterthought
general 2023-05-21 07:44:05 and there has been no balancing updates since the weapons existed
general 2023-05-21 07:48:01 didnt the dev ask rick to work for him
general 2023-05-21 07:48:13 thats pretty insulting

general 2023-05-22 22:19:48 give an example
general 2023-05-22 22:21:40 because the shaders are ugly
general 2023-05-22 22:21:58 waters down the lighting and blurs the screenshot
general 2023-05-22 22:22:59 pcc doesn’t approve of shaders in <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-05-22 22:23:14 they artificially make builds look better if they arent done wrong
general 2023-05-22 22:23:23 this one uses shaders in a bad way lol
general 2023-05-22 22:23:50 the shaders make his build look worse
general 2023-05-22 22:23:54 when will people realise

general 2023-05-22 22:27:22 either because its mechanically basic and done to death

general 2023-05-22 22:27:45 pcc is just kids pretending to be mechanical engineers even though they have no idea what they’re talking about

general 2023-05-22 22:43:43 isnt math important for your engineering course
general 2023-05-22 22:44:08 well i suppose you’re not doing the full thing
general 2023-05-22 22:44:31 do many of your classmates get the opportunity to take a sidecourse
general 2023-05-22 22:45:05 also he just confused the graph of 1/x with e^x
general 2023-05-22 22:45:20 was pulling stuff out of his ass about black holes lol

general 2023-05-27 01:55:01 what is he trying to say
general 2023-05-27 01:55:09 is he saying china is better or worse lol
general 2023-05-27 02:00:53 SODA
general 2023-05-27 07:44:59 stupid game
general 2023-05-27 07:46:06 ballistics tracker literally an iphone 7 on camera mode
general 2023-05-27 07:46:07 🤣
general 2023-05-27 07:47:14 wym
general 2023-05-27 07:47:57 deadline r700 has has bugged zeroing
general 2023-05-27 07:48:03 but the ranges are a lot longer in deadline than pf
general 2023-05-27 07:48:26 last time i played no
general 2023-05-27 07:48:30 mosin still supreme
general 2023-05-27 07:48:44 but when r700 hits in deadline it does ronnie mcnutt tier damage
general 2023-05-27 07:48:53 unlike in pf which is peashooter besides headshots
general 2023-05-27 07:49:06 higher damage dropoff than intervention iirc
general 2023-05-27 07:49:22 cos its a similar calibre
general 2023-05-27 07:49:32 sniper rifles would definitely be capable of OHK to the torso
general 2023-05-27 07:49:34 unlike in pf
general 2023-05-27 07:49:38 (besides bfg and hecate)
general 2023-05-27 07:49:52 but those dont count cos their anti materiel
general 2023-05-27 07:50:22 half of pf gun models look dogshit
general 2023-05-27 07:50:36 mg42 for example has barely usable iron sights
general 2023-05-27 07:51:11 hmm yes
general 2023-05-27 07:51:47 lets stick a carboard cutout ironsight of an anime girl onto a gun
general 2023-05-27 07:52:13 who needs zeroing anyway
general 2023-05-27 07:52:34 lol no its not
general 2023-05-27 07:52:59 pf weapon power creep is real deal
general 2023-05-27 07:53:18 some of the more noobier weapons like intervention are completely obsolete compared to higher ranked guns of the same class
general 2023-05-27 07:53:45 and pf ttk is either
general 2023-05-27 07:53:57 unrealistically slow halo-esque kills
general 2023-05-27 07:54:03 or instakill blink and you miss it
general 2023-05-27 07:54:34 there is no consistency in the gunplay pacing
general 2023-05-27 07:54:39 this is why pf is dogshit
general 2023-05-27 07:55:26 average pf children
general 2023-05-27 07:56:04 call of robloxia 5
general 2023-05-27 07:56:09 had better fps pacing than phantom forces
general 2023-05-27 07:56:36 drawn out firefights tend to be more fun
general 2023-05-27 07:56:39 where cover is actually useful
general 2023-05-27 07:56:55 pf ttk with guns is either too short or too long
general 2023-05-27 07:56:56 thats the issue
general 2023-05-27 07:57:02 its not consistent
general 2023-05-27 07:57:05 and u dont need cover at all
general 2023-05-27 07:57:15 90% of the guns wallbang like a .50BMG for some reason
general 2023-05-27 07:57:47 no
general 2023-05-27 07:58:02 even barriers and sheet metal get penned so easily
general 2023-05-27 07:58:29 any assault rifle or lmg will shred cover
general 2023-05-27 07:59:05 and because the movement system is so jank
general 2023-05-27 07:59:11 you can just run up to your opponent instead of taking cover
general 2023-05-27 07:59:33 its not fun at all cos its so braindead
general 2023-05-27 07:59:58 then when you kill them it's funny that they have a slight chance to respawn a few seconds away from you before shooting you in the back of the head
general 2023-05-27 08:01:02 i dont know what the devs are trying to do
general 2023-05-27 08:01:06 they have a beautiful ballistics system
general 2023-05-27 08:01:17 but cant emulate basic calibres or bullet ricochets
general 2023-05-27 08:01:28 its like theyre trying so hard to be realistic
general 2023-05-27 08:01:36 then go halfway and say "fuck it"
general 2023-05-27 08:01:47 there is no theme to pf
general 2023-05-27 08:02:13 ah yes the shotgun
general 2023-05-27 08:02:33 
general 2023-05-27 08:02:34 no lol
general 2023-05-27 08:02:48 if it was realistic you'd be tagging people halfway across the map with birdshot
general 2023-05-27 08:03:03 because a lot of them like warehouse are prettys mall
general 2023-05-27 08:03:22 skill tissue
general 2023-05-27 08:03:58 not rlly
general 2023-05-27 08:04:09 after some really short distance each pellet is a subject of RNGesus
general 2023-05-27 08:04:18 yet again no consistency in spread
general 2023-05-27 08:04:39 let me boot up pf and show
general 2023-05-27 08:04:40 🤮
general 2023-05-27 08:06:41 ks-23m for example
general 2023-05-27 08:06:46 minimum damage after 52m
general 2023-05-27 08:06:50 irl effective firing range is 3x that
general 2023-05-27 08:07:09 the shotguns are literally 3x weaker in pf
general 2023-05-27 08:11:02 wrong
general 2023-05-27 08:11:12 battlefield tends to have damage dropoff begin later
general 2023-05-27 08:11:40 deadline, i dont have to explain why their shotguns are better
general 2023-05-27 08:11:50 hll, you can consistently score kills up to 100m with the trench gun
general 2023-05-27 08:13:21 definitely not as bad as pf lol
general 2023-05-27 08:17:56 pf makes you question your own gender identity the same as genshin impact
general 2023-05-27 08:18:10 not worth the brainless point and click
general 2023-05-27 08:20:49 scp sl has better gunplay than phantom forces
general 2023-05-27 08:20:50 i shit you not
general 2023-05-27 08:20:59 and you can bully kids using your voice assuming mods arent watching
general 2023-05-27 08:23:52 gun model looks ass

general 2023-05-27 11:53:17 do you speak russian
general 2023-05-27 11:57:49 ok but with мои why is it "меня зовук" and not "мои зовук"
the way i understand it is мои is possessive
general 2023-05-27 11:58:40 "my name is"
general 2023-05-27 11:58:59 hello biden
general 2023-05-27 12:00:48 but in the context of saying "my house" is it not "мои дом"
general 2023-05-27 12:00:51 how is it plural only
general 2023-05-27 12:01:03 ok so that makes sense

general 2023-06-02 10:04:27 massive girth
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:10:53 is there a reason for you to spin faster
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:11:43 what are the conditions for the spin
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:12:45 is this with the assumption that there is resistance
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:13:13 no its artifically on wings
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:13:23 but roblox physics has some weird thing where objects artificially get resistance too
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:13:28 out of nowhere
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:13:56 are u using a motor to spin
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:09 cos rn im leaning towards no you will not get faster
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:20 if you are spinning solely using the momentum of the ballast
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:29 you will actually get slower by pulling it closer
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:31 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:53 this is because radius is a factor of torque
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:14:59 they are proportional
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:15:09 the closer it is, the less force on your spin
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:15:59 same principle should apply
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:16:09 u get more rotational force from something rotating further away
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:16:45 on google
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:18:22 u can ask dudeiamstuk for physics questions cos hes a physics major
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:18:47 generally irl physics can be translated to roblox physics
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 10:19:10 so true
general 2023-06-02 11:41:55 the guy in the vid is actually serious though
general 2023-06-02 11:42:11 he has a whole channel of doing roblox ceremonies

plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:28:52 and scp sl has funner gunplay than pf ever will
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:30:34 better than point and click EZ WIN spawn teleportation simulator
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:31:34 how nice of the game to lock inherently superior weapons behind a grind/pay wall
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:31:57 and while the devs make bank from a cash cow they still cant patch the multitude of exploits that've been in the game since alpha??
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:36:13 the gameplay has less variety than the genes of the inbred audience the FPS was meant for
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:41:52 <@711516970230612030> why u still play that game
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:42:09 NK later?
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:42:17 wym suppression
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:42:22 that barely exists in PF
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:47:20 theres no way
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:47:24 screen shake is so minimal
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:47:52 are you sure it's not an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:48:27 https://tenor.com/view/tayomaki-sakigifs-stan-twitter-monkey-eating-gif-22140397
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:48:50 probably an exploit then
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:48:53 pf suppression sucks ass
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:49:00 knew that since pre alpha

general 2023-06-09 09:09:40 not even roblox anymore
general 2023-06-09 09:10:16 too bad cod is ass
general 2023-06-09 09:10:21 ive had more fun playing roblox fps games
general 2023-06-09 09:10:26 (not phantom forces)
general 2023-06-09 09:11:10 the most memorable cod campaign i've played was the 2006 COD 3
general 2023-06-09 09:11:25 might be a bit nostalgic but
general 2023-06-09 09:11:34 the new games dont have the same atmosphere
general 2023-06-09 09:12:30 not necessarily
general 2023-06-09 09:12:47 cod has been following the same formula for a long time in terms of shooting
general 2023-06-09 09:13:38 a lot of games on roblox have implemented other features (leaning, sight calibration, realistic hit models etc.)
general 2023-06-09 09:14:11 cod's gunplay isn't bad
general 2023-06-09 09:14:14 it's just boring because its all the same
general 2023-06-09 09:14:42 they did have wallrunning though
general 2023-06-09 09:14:55 that was pretty neat
general 2023-06-09 09:15:39 roblox is a shit engine for a tank game
general 2023-06-09 09:16:05 tanmk is good but roblox being roblox gajins you on a lot of shots

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:16:11 why do you need this to draw
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:17:06 claiming you know these things with no context doesnt make you look smarter lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:19:07 almost as if gravity is an artificial game function that doesnt take mass into account
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:19:48 what grade are you in
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:20:45 not that high tbh
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:21:01 but I can be wrong
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:22:40 <@989181410172629052> when you said you needed F=GMm/r^2 do you even know how that formula is derived
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:23:04 or is it something you just mentioned to look smart
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:23:42 wym
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:24:01 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:24:05 3 sig figs
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:24:27 thats how we do it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:24:35 see you dont even know what G is
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:25:17 you just found the equation from google to hyperinflate your own ego
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:25:35 THE FOG IS COMING

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:30:36 probably grade 5

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:32:09 he doesnt know anything
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:32:34 he googled the gravitation formula and didnt even understand any of it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:33:16 F=GMm/r^2 is what he said, apparently he needed it to “draw” a satellite
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:33:29 he doesnt even know that G stands for the gravitational constant
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 03:34:15 yes but unlike him you dont pull equations out of your ass to appear smarter than you are

the-dump 2023-06-10 05:35:29 tanks get destroyed in a war
the-dump 2023-06-10 05:35:32 no way how could this happen?!?!?1
the-dump 2023-06-10 05:41:13 its as if they were being used for battle?? t14 armata engineers be taking notes rn
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:00:06 do you like exposed locks
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:00:12 they appear appealing to you?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:02:15 exposed locks can only look good if they are intentionally for detailing
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:02:26 that is a rare situation
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:02:30 not always
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:02:52 but too many and they detract from the smoothness or shape of the build
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:03:27 the position of an exposed lock also plays into account
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:03:39 if its in a prominent spot its like a fat wart on the build
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:18:36 no you arent
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:19:01 ok what
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:20:16 theyve been a thing since at least 2020 or before
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:20:22 you didnt even join until a year after lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 06:21:10 and in 2020 WORKING flat tracks were already invented too

the-dump 2023-06-10 06:48:25 who said that lmao
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:48:29 some 13 year old on twitter?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:06 burden of evidence is on you for that one
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:46 theres a lack of important people claiming the leopard 2a6 was the best in the world
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:59 you can't even name one person?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:31 yes and russia abandoned a number of t90s for ukrainian farmers
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:38 one is in florida now
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:40 whats your point
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:54:53 the T90M that ukrainians captured is newer than the 2A6
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:55:00 so the destruction of a leopard 2 is irrelevant really
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:55:23 the russians can take the technology all they want, but they cant mass produce anything out of it lmao
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:55:25 t14 armata:
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:56:00 so what if its a western tank
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:56:04 they're not wonderweapons
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:57:00 who lmao?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:57:14 the commander of the 1st tank brigade disagreed with western MBTs because of the logistical strain
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:58:05 doesn't look like anyone there would "cry" over tanks lol
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:58:27 and what is sent isn't even the newest generation so the insinuation that they're supposed to be the "best tanks" is complete bullshit dude
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:59:02 lets talk about the t14 for a change
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:59:13 supposed to be "revolutionary," but not one seen on the battlefield?
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:00:26 only recorded in russian-controlled airspace
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:00:57 russia is a whole generation behind in terms of air power
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:02:10 from my understanding the helicopters are decent though
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:02:26 the USA actually bought some MI-24s from russia
general 2023-06-10 08:19:17 except the tools are all rusted surplus that a chinese sweatshop donated for free because they couldnt work for a shift without breaking down
general 2023-06-10 08:19:49 reminder that from now until a few hours all mods are sleeping
general 2023-06-10 08:20:00 whoever plans to spam gay nsfw of black men better do it now
general 2023-06-10 08:21:03 my tickets get reviewed pretty quickly
general 2023-06-10 08:21:07 not a bad wait tbh
general 2023-06-10 08:30:05 fuzzy is a gay furry
general 2023-06-10 08:30:12 its understandable
general 2023-06-10 08:30:50 true
general 2023-06-10 08:31:09 ok thats a skill issue
general 2023-06-10 08:31:12 but the game is still bad
general 2023-06-10 08:31:17 skil issue
general 2023-06-10 08:31:35 you cant say the game is bad if you are bad
general 2023-06-10 08:31:58 the best players hate this game for different reasons

general 2023-06-10 13:31:51 hi <@539142193311514675>
general 2023-06-10 13:54:30 too old
the-dump 2023-06-10 20:23:38 a lot of modern tanks have shot traps
the-dump 2023-06-10 20:23:57 but they dont really matter because most tank battles are at very long ranges
the-dump 2023-06-10 20:24:26 the weakspots are difficult to hit so gunners are trained to aim for center mass
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:00 life expectancy for gay people is up to 20 years less than the norm according to the national library of medicine
the zero abuse project states that lgbt make up 1/5 child lovers, despite lgbt being 1/14 the US population. therefore they are 3x more likely to be nonces.
a survey of 600 furries shows that only around 10% of furries are straight
despite zoophiles being 2% of the population, wikifur shows that furries make up 18% of zoophiles
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:35 so no this isn't "heehee hoohoo" because it's not a laughing matter
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:27:06 and the national library of medicine has shown that there has been some level of correlation between father absence and lgbt
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:27:24 I do concede that the research is contested as of now
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:29:37 that was my alt
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:29:49 my main account got deactivated because some whitename probably false reported me
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:29:56 tech can kick my alt if he wants
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:29:58 i cant be bothered signing back into it
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:30:54 true
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:31:24 gay people make up 82% of HIV diagnosis in the USA
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:31:37 source: CDC
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:31:56 but apparently its perfectly healthy and nothing is wrong with it
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:31:57 hahaha
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:32:52 looks like a lot of them already do that to themself
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:33:24 suicide rate of lgbt teens is 2x higher according to the trevor project
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:35:46 some of them alr
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:36:20 but i dont think they realise its a gateway to harmful activities
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:37:25 but the ones who try shove this agenda down people's throats and deface the millenia-lasting icon of a rainbow are very annoying
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:38:44 the australian institute of health and welfare shows that LGBT people are 1.5x more likely to consume alcohol at damaging amounts
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:39:20 4x more likely to use drugs
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:39:26 9x more likely to use inhalants
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:40:47 the CDC outlines that there is a higher correlation between LGBT and mental disorders
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:42:14 one could argue that this is due to not having the "right resources"
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:43:20 HOWEVER, the netherlands statistics agency says that gay couples tend to be wealthy, hence they should be able to easily afford life benefitting services

general 2023-06-12 07:46:25 hes back
general 2023-06-12 07:46:34 😱
general 2023-06-12 08:00:14 
general 2023-06-12 08:00:54 couldnt tell
general 2023-06-12 08:01:00 looks like a person
general 2023-06-12 08:59:42 other way around
general 2023-06-12 09:00:29 sounds like a personal issue tbh
general 2023-06-12 09:00:51 pvp is objectively the more unpolished side of the game
general 2023-06-12 10:36:25 more like a childcare center full of toddlers who dont know how to stick two pieces of lego together
general 2023-06-12 13:17:34 “first” jets? the ones copied from namnam tutorials???
general 2023-06-12 13:18:10 most pub players arent that good
general 2023-06-12 13:19:16 comparing plane crazy players to real engineers is an insult to the whole occupation
general 2023-06-12 13:19:46 and randos on public servers no less
general 2023-06-12 13:21:30 so true
general 2023-06-12 13:22:15 pc physics need rework in pc2
general 2023-06-12 13:22:29 might break half the builds but i dont mind
general 2023-06-12 13:24:06 sku
general 2023-06-12 13:24:45 centripetal force already exists
general 2023-06-12 13:24:53 g force is a thing
general 2023-06-12 13:24:57 but not noticeable
general 2023-06-12 13:25:03 because pc is dogshit
general 2023-06-12 13:26:12 g forces are a thing
general 2023-06-12 13:26:18 builds breaking from them arent
general 2023-06-12 13:27:19 centripetal acceleration and hence g force can be proven using an experiment involving a spinning motor
general 2023-06-12 13:27:29 i cant be bothered showing it now cos im not at my pc
general 2023-06-12 13:27:44 it exists but it has no impact
general 2023-06-12 13:29:59 might break every build
general 2023-06-12 13:30:11 the best option is to get rid of glitch engines entirely
general 2023-06-12 13:30:15 at the least nerf them
general 2023-06-12 13:31:30 im neighbours with rickje
general 2023-06-12 13:31:44 every night i see him in roblox studio I can hear wet noises from his apartment
general 2023-06-12 13:33:42 we said that already
general 2023-06-12 13:34:44 plane crazy 3
general 2023-06-12 13:35:11 the damaging impact of “g force” shouldnt be a thing
general 2023-06-12 13:35:17 every build would cease to function
general 2023-06-12 13:35:27 motors would destroy builds through sheer torque
general 2023-06-12 13:36:41 the things in pc pvp would be alien technology by modern standards
general 2023-06-12 13:37:12 things coming from mach 5 to a stop in a split second shouldnt be a thing in pc at all
general 2023-06-12 13:39:22 glitch engines are the issue
general 2023-06-12 13:39:27 they shouldnt have existed at all
general 2023-06-12 13:39:34 hence why they are called that
general 2023-06-12 13:40:34 motorlocking is a double edged sword
general 2023-06-12 13:41:03 but it at least offers something of value to every playee
general 2023-06-12 13:41:36 glitch engines just make normal ones obsolete and are the cheapest method to getting a build to unrealistically high speeds
general 2023-06-12 13:41:41 theres no skill in using glitch engines
general 2023-06-12 13:41:43 unlike motorlocks
general 2023-06-12 14:06:46 where did axis lock come from
general 2023-06-12 14:07:13 who

general 2023-06-17 10:00:01 and balance was already ruined with the powercreep of newer guns
general 2023-06-17 10:00:43 no pf has worse movement than that lol
general 2023-06-17 10:01:00 spammable dolphin diving, crouch sliding and superjumping already exists
general 2023-06-17 10:01:11 they werent intentional by the devs either so they get abused by every player because it's the meta
general 2023-06-17 10:01:48 arsenal has more gameplay variety
general 2023-06-17 10:01:54 but its just as repetitive
general 2023-06-17 10:02:09 + somehow more exploiters than pf
general 2023-06-17 10:02:14 every second server theres an aimbotter
general 2023-06-17 10:02:20 pf also has an exploiter issue but its not as bad
general 2023-06-17 10:02:42 a lot of arsenal weapons are actually unique
general 2023-06-17 10:02:49 unless pf, where half of them are reskins with slightly altered stats
general 2023-06-17 10:03:01 one good example is the bfg and hecate
general 2023-06-17 10:03:59 pf is reliant on the higher tier weapons now
general 2023-06-17 10:04:07 an intervention is not nearly as viable as higher ranked sniper rifles
general 2023-06-17 10:04:12 they nerfed it
general 2023-06-17 10:04:39 none of the weapons feel unique or act like "sidegrades"
general 2023-06-17 10:04:51 its very much a linear upgrade system with guns
general 2023-06-17 10:05:04 for the most part, at least
general 2023-06-17 10:06:47 each player moves around like captain america too
general 2023-06-17 10:06:55 there is no weight to player movement
general 2023-06-17 10:07:13 the levels of run and gun are even worse than COD
general 2023-06-17 10:07:32 and i say that as someone who's played BO3 and AW
general 2023-06-17 10:08:35 there really isnt much room to make tactical decisions or come up with strategies to tackle the enemy, because by then, theyve had already spawned 5 meters behind you and shot you in the head
general 2023-06-17 10:09:31 some people might find a braindead point and click shooter fun, but by no means is it a good FPS

plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:42:49 no
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:43:07 but you need to apply force for there to be damage
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:43:32 best if its constant force too
general 2023-06-17 11:10:12 most of the time they are annoying
general 2023-06-17 11:10:38 people dont hate them just because of their age
general 2023-06-17 11:10:47 but their age is indicative of their behaviour

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:23:02 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:24:38 but it has to stay in contact with a block with force applied
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:25:06 if you shoot a cutter at a build theres a good chance it'll bounce off without damage because it only contacts for that brief impact
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:26:00 i'd max out both if i was using default suspension
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:26:19 but the best ones are custom mechanisms that use the default suspension
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:44:22 it can happen
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:44:29 but with the way game physics is
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:44:44 it might just bounce off with no damage
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:45:01 but the buoyancy of the water does help propel it upwards, so probably more likely to do damage than if u were on land
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:46:59 like a harpoon
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:47:00 sounds cool

general 2023-06-23 04:47:52 ofc him dying isnt a good thing
general 2023-06-23 04:48:15 but if he believed in his sub then him standing by it gives him bigger balls than most billionaires

general 2023-06-23 04:51:23 but that ceo shouldve just motorlocked tnt armour into his sub smh
general 2023-06-23 04:52:06 i think it was the window that gave out
general 2023-06-23 04:52:16 then everything else followed
general 2023-06-23 04:52:51 they signed waivers to confirm the possibility of death
general 2023-06-23 04:52:56 they probably knew it was a shit idea
general 2023-06-23 04:53:23 but rich people love throwing money at bad ideas
general 2023-06-23 04:53:42 logitech controller sales going up now

general 2023-06-23 06:27:51 i agree that there needs to be limits on billionaires
general 2023-06-23 06:28:33 but i dont think the people on board (at least not all) actively worked to harm others financially
general 2023-06-23 06:29:40 the father and son went on the trip because it was father’s day

general 2023-06-24 09:27:34 i thought wagner didnt even like ukraine lol
general 2023-06-24 09:27:41 why would they get ukraine to fight for them
general 2023-06-24 09:28:15 reminds me of when trump bombed that iranian general
general 2023-06-24 09:28:17 where we dropping boys
general 2023-06-24 09:28:44 tbh im amazed wagner lasted this long
general 2023-06-24 09:28:50 prigozhin has been trashtalking the mod for months now
general 2023-06-24 09:29:10 remember when he threatened to leave bakhmut over an ammo shortage
general 2023-06-24 09:29:20 russian high command probs like a cod lobby rn
general 2023-06-24 09:30:10 "we told the conscripts to rush B but the pidors went to A" - prigozhin
general 2023-06-24 09:30:47 dont think wagner has that large of a presence in sudan yet
general 2023-06-24 09:30:52 most of them still in eastern europe
general 2023-06-24 09:31:09 but when they do all migrate sudan will be like pubg with aimbotters (wagner superior gear)
general 2023-06-24 09:32:58 russia has 6k nukes

general 2023-06-24 09:33:36 how
general 2023-06-24 09:33:43 this is already widely documented
general 2023-06-24 09:33:48 and 6k is also a US estimate
general 2023-06-24 09:33:53 so its not just russian bluff

general 2023-06-24 13:19:43 "If anyone gets in our way, we will destroy everything!”
general 2023-06-24 13:20:06 his combative statements against the MOD made putin brand him a traitor
general 2023-06-24 13:20:31 the news floating around is prigozhin is in rostov rn
general 2023-06-24 13:20:39 wagner has captured the entire city and the FSB headquarters there
general 2023-06-24 13:21:02 theres no way they'll get to moscow
general 2023-06-24 13:21:09 but they will still fuck russia up
general 2023-06-24 13:21:20 especially as rostov is a major supply center for the russian war effort in ukraine
general 2023-06-24 13:21:40 both sides are telling each other to stand down
general 2023-06-24 13:22:10 one video of wagner completely surrounding FSB headquarters and (probably) demanding surrender
general 2023-06-24 13:22:21 meanwhile another address was made to wagner telling them to stop
general 2023-06-24 13:22:47 idk what their goal is
general 2023-06-24 13:22:56 they'd get clapped by the 2mil army in russia
general 2023-06-24 13:23:11 unless they truce with ukraine (unlikely)
general 2023-06-24 13:24:28 meanwhile russia has been consistently losing ground near bakhmut after wagner left
general 2023-06-24 13:25:16 bakhmut is just a meatgrinder

general 2023-06-24 13:28:06 except they havent really recovered after the initial months of the war
general 2023-06-24 13:28:18 most of their experienced troops are dead iirc
general 2023-06-24 13:28:41 
general 2023-06-24 13:29:20 half of the guys in that image are probably dead
general 2023-06-24 13:29:52 dunno
general 2023-06-24 13:29:59 but with how close they dropped to kiev
general 2023-06-24 13:30:13 probably couldnt retreat before ukraine crushed the northern attack

general 2023-06-28 05:46:13 ackhually 🤓
general 2023-06-28 05:46:23 you have to pay 100 robux per save slot
general 2023-06-28 05:46:51 pvp mode is a gamepass
general 2023-06-28 05:47:02 changing colours beyond the default pallet is a gamepass
general 2023-06-28 05:47:06 motorlock is a gamepass
general 2023-06-28 05:47:56 vip servers cost 1000 robux and the PCC vips shutdown
general 2023-06-28 05:48:18 the original still sucks ass bro
general 2023-06-28 05:48:48 one of the gamepasses, that we spent money on, doesnt even work properly now
general 2023-06-28 05:49:00 treads are near non-functional in pc1 too
general 2023-06-28 05:49:16 one shot in pvp, or a bad collision and you lose the entire track
general 2023-06-28 05:49:34 plus treads just lag and throttle ur own build
general 2023-06-28 05:49:46 they warp and teleport around on other peoples screens
general 2023-06-28 05:49:55 so they dont look good for anyone but urself
general 2023-06-28 05:50:08 fake track supremacy 💪
general 2023-06-28 05:50:25 make fake treads out of wings and you can fly or get airtime at the least
general 2023-06-28 05:50:53 much better than lagging to death when ur above 50sps lol
general 2023-06-28 05:51:29 shredders are easy to counter
general 2023-06-28 05:51:39 any fast jet, even ground vehicle can shoot them down
general 2023-06-28 05:51:43 theyre pretty fragile
general 2023-06-28 05:51:56 treads that dont work
general 2023-06-28 05:52:00 they just stay in place
general 2023-06-28 05:52:11 theyre for looks
general 2023-06-28 05:52:17 and to move u use super rockets inside
general 2023-06-28 05:52:34 i tried that with explosive balls but they dont work

general 2023-06-28 05:53:34 wont be too effective
general 2023-06-28 05:53:59 yes thats me shooting the plane
general 2023-06-28 05:54:08 if even 1 explosive worked it wouldve died on the spot
general 2023-06-28 05:54:42 dude
general 2023-06-28 05:55:00 any reasonable speed will bounce the explosive

plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:02:28 reports would get filled with the most petty bullshit
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:04:02 50% of players are above 13
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:04:20 where did u get "average age for roblox is 9 to 12 years old"
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:04:57 that is the mode value
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:04:59 not average
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:05:07 they are different bro
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:05:42 no 9-12
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:08:23 probably 25+
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:08:34 because i do know its around 15%
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:08:43 16% isnt too far out the ballpark
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:10:47 anyway i wouldnt reduce plane crazy to a “kids game,” theres a lot of advanced concepts that a 12 year old would not understand in practise
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:11:43 pushing this game to its limits incurs *basic* high school physics and engineering
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:12:11 theres a fair share of adults and older teens in pcc
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:12:53 then you dont play enough
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:13:10 there are complicated mechanisms that can barely exist due to how fragile motors are
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:14:05 some engines, calculators, transmissions
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:15:17 i had 8 wing transverse crankshaft ornithopter
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:15:48 except that was prone to breaking because motor2s are  very weak
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:16:14 its in my saves but im not going ingame anytime soon
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:16:34 i also know people who literally run out of motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:16:45 1000 motorlocks are not enough for some of the best players
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:17:15 😭
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:17:28 also that guy with the tiger hull
general 2023-06-28 06:17:41 we are joking
general 2023-06-28 06:17:51 its about if pc2 was made by EA
general 2023-06-28 06:19:07 pvp permadeath system
general 2023-06-28 06:19:12 pay robux to respawn
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:20:54 iirc drdownhill spent 300 locks on a plane nose too
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:21:04 **just** a nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:21:20 so the game is as easy as people make it to be
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:04 u have to set ur own expectations. if ur build is lacking in quality then ofc its easy
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:10 its true
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:16 i saw him in vip1
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:37 motor hell
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:51 it was for a conical nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:22:58 u can ask him
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:23:01 but he prob deleted it
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:24:14 taking my point further
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:24:21 there have been builds that required multiple accounts
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:24:35 one good example is nightchaser’s diorama in hof
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:25:02 maybe even the doom bfg setpiece too
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:25:09 think thats multiple accs
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:26:24 referring to my original point, the reason pc is for all ages is because you choose the game’s difficulty
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:26:36 its an open ended sandbox
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:26:43 even though its a buggy mess
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:27:55 the 2 undes i exposed recently:
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 06:28:43 theyre the same kids that call actual adults “kid” and get pressed when theyre teased for being a child

the-dump 2023-06-28 09:45:29 the two numbers support each other
the-dump 2023-06-28 09:46:28 to be fair though, furries have much larger online communities than in real life
the-dump 2023-06-28 09:47:09 and in real life you start to get things such as Rainfurrest in 2015, which is far worse than the usual online presence of furries
the-dump 2023-06-28 09:48:25 the surveys arent anonymous
the-dump 2023-06-28 09:51:16 the rainfurrest convention that spanned nearly a decade was ended after their last one involved assault (not just the violent type), taking literal shits outside of the toilet, drugs and vandalism

plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:51:56 a bit over one
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:52:19 now the exact value depends on how tall u are saying a robloxian is in meters
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:52:49 do u want to use the official value of 1.4m (iirc) or realistic value of 1.7m
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:53:42 1.7/5 = 0.34m per stud
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:54:11 1 block is 2.5 studs so you get 0.85m per block
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:55:14 typically

general 2023-06-28 15:01:51 (does the same damage as 1 explosive block)
general 2023-06-28 15:02:13 rick needs to implement tnt scaling
general 2023-06-28 15:02:27 for example if u combine 2 tnts u get the explosive radius of 2 tnts
general 2023-06-28 15:02:35 instead of radius of 1 tnt except in 2 blocks
general 2023-06-28 15:03:11 but make scaling exponentially reduced as more and more tnts get added
general 2023-06-28 15:03:19 so people dont make multipleplot radius nukes

general 2023-06-28 15:37:09 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:38:36 that is the stat that studio gives
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:38:51 people in pcc tend to use either ~170 or 140
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:39:30 i checked it in studio
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:39:38 1 stud is 0.28cm
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:39:51 so a robloxian according to studio is 1.4m
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:40:03 but i prefer thinking that robloxians are overly wide rather than overly squished
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 15:40:05 so i use 1.7

general 2023-06-28 15:59:28 probably could still pen knight armour in some places
general 2023-06-28 16:02:09 the "blunt force trauma" would have virtually no effect because
1. the knight is wearing a gambeson underneath designed to pad against impact weapons (maces, hammers etc.)
2. armour is designed to ricochet arrows so a lot of the energy is not deposited into the wearer upon a nonpen

general 2023-06-29 13:45:37 companies like that exist in every country
general 2023-06-29 13:45:44 china is one of the worst offenders
general 2023-06-29 13:47:52 they lobby (bribe) politicians and lawmakers to support clauses that help nestle thrive
general 2023-06-29 13:48:38 since 2020 theyve spent over 4 million USD on lobbying

general 2023-06-29 14:20:12 ??
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:34:05 ok so water propellors work everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:34:07 is that what ur saying
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:58:33 keep texture default
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:58:40 stop using cheese grater wings
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:58:59 build needs to be more streamlined, its too blocky
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:59:09 and why is the propellor in the back
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:59:29 is your pilot seat the wrong way around
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 14:59:58 looks weird
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:00:00 what plane is it
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:11:36 looks like something went wrong with the scaling
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:12:46 canards are too large relative to the main wings
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:13:42 might need motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:14:14 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:14:24 the main wings u can angle lock so it doesnt look curved
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:14:46 do you know how to motorlock for starters
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:15:12 have you made a custom angle before
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:15:29 try searching on yt
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:16:03 i watched this one when i was learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=milhBhz92AQ
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:18:34 ok but this guy is clueless
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:18:41 he needs to learn from somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:19:20 just go on yt
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:19:32 then experiment play around with locks by urself
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:19:59 motor is powered + locked
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:17 u rotate the motor how u want it then activate the motorlock tower to fuse the custom angle with the structure u want
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:35 most ppl use explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:41 but u can use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:52 springs kinda suck cos they get stuck in ur towers
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:21:18 i only use springs if space is valuable
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:21:32 otherwise disconnector my beloved
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:22:41 tnts best
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:22:47 but dont work on pub so i cant flex on children
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:23:09 works in pvp if every stat is reduced to 0 but u get shredder'd by that one kid immediately
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:24:38 u activate the spring
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:24:44 and the spring breaks welds with surrounding blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:24:55 (only if u have the setting enabled in configs)
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:36:31 ur gonna have 1 exposed lock if ur locking wings
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:37:04 its better than having wings the wrong shape

plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:31 you have to blacklist ppl to have cutter launchers be good
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:38 mass blacklist = doodoofard
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:56 better to use explosives
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:50:12 cutters are just as likely to bounce off and do no damage
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:50:20 except explosives u can manually detonate + has radius
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:52:04 u can make area denial weapons with explosive blocks + magnets
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:52:48 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:53:01 unless u manually detonate each one
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:53:03 but thats lame
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:55:39 false
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:55:45 momentum isnt transferred into the aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:10 it doesnt
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:22 spin makes no diff too
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:35 you are more likely to explode YOURSELF
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:45 if you leave it to the impact mode on explosives

plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:39:22 dont have an issue with lag
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:39:41 rick are you still taking suggestions for pc2?
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:43:20 whats wrong with jetpack
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:49:12 pls no
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:49:22 because it will make pvp easy mode
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:49:54 and how will that work dude
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:50:10 we shouldnt have distinctions between pvp and nonpvp save slots in the game system
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:50:18 thats all player designated
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:50:57 the amount of namnam jets and shredders in pvp is already insufferable
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:51:23 we dont need 90% of the 12 year old players to be using the same OP jet
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:52:41 what we need is more pvp variety in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:52:43 and its important rick sees this
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:52:54 the meta shouldnt consist of the same jet archetype
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:54:07 there is no incentive to build a large pvp creation nor an incentive to use any weapons besides the default 10 gun, 12 rocket and 4 firework spam
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:54:44 TNT as a weapon is not viable right now because on impact doesnt even work properly
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:56:25 of course youtubers will make more tutorials but with added complexity players can be encouraged to explore different approaches to combat besides the same jet
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:56:50 <@594118415384313856> lets test that
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:56:54 look ingame
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 09:59:16 different types of explosions would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:02:48 its time balancing changes become a reality in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:03:05 planes shouldnt be able to fly with a whole wing torn off
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:04:33 just nerf wing and trapdoor hp
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:05:08 the fact that 10 guns are barely effective at medium range is an issue
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:05:12 so either buff gun damage or nerf part hp
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:06:40 lag still a huge issue in pc1
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:07:59 what i want to see in pc2 is more weapons
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:08:05 and give waterjet a use
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:08:30 nobody uses waterjets
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:08:43 not for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:08:54 waterjets are literally just a cosmetic block in a pvp slot
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:09:01 why is it in the PVP section if nobody uses it for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:09:07 either take it out or give it purpose
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:09:54 would be great if the range wasnt smaller than techmaster's height
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:11:59 understandable, thanks for the muchneeded pc1 patch though
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:13:38 would be nice if waterjets could be used to launch blocks at other players
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:13:41 much like magnets
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:16 me waiting for the napalm and chemical weapons update
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:37 its not too bad
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:41 ppl use it for cosmetics
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:01 what needs a TOTAL rework is lava launcher though
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:06 the model is pretty ugly
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:32 the range, the damage, the particle fx
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:33 all abysmal
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:35 no offence to rick
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:16:06 
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:16:10 rick gib real flamethrowers pls 🙏
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:17:46 lava launchers/flamers should have massively more range than they do in pc1
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:18:02 they are obsolete rn
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:22:04 <@217336009455566848> 
is the cannon making an appearance in pc2 in any shape or form? a kinetic based weapon would be a nice breath of fresh air.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:23:10 or it could just fire its own projectiles like in besiege, with a reload
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:23:20 non explosive, just a penetrating projectile at high velocity

plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:26:31 rick should make this exploit a feature and unban the kid who made it
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:27:18 never  forget

general 2023-07-03 11:03:21 titanfall 2 has bigger playercount than BO3
general 2023-07-03 11:03:31 and basically better everything
general 2023-07-03 11:04:15 ok maybe not rn
general 2023-07-03 11:04:18 but last month it was bigger
general 2023-07-03 11:05:00 battlefield 1 is still alive
general 2023-07-03 11:05:07 best battlefield to date
general 2023-07-03 11:05:46 campaign was one of the best FPS stories too
general 2023-07-03 11:06:17 there were points where the campaign felt mid, but not straight up bad (like in BFV or half the CODs)

general 2023-07-03 11:27:39 but it looks like theres more gameplay variety
general 2023-07-03 11:27:49 the problem is that the playercount is near dead for an AAA game of the sort

general 2023-07-03 12:39:16 what is your best build
general 2023-07-03 12:40:21 thats not a crime
general 2023-07-03 12:40:26 its called minor trolling
general 2023-07-03 12:41:07 i dont think they would blow it up though
general 2023-07-03 12:41:16 if the fallout fell onto any NATO country
general 2023-07-03 12:41:20 then russia would get invaded
general 2023-07-03 12:41:50 a nuclear incident would be far worse than flooding
general 2023-07-03 12:42:00 the area would be uninhabitable for centuries
general 2023-07-03 12:42:42 yes and ww3
general 2023-07-03 12:42:50 in that case we will never get pc2
general 2023-07-03 12:42:56 because rickjes house will get nuked
general 2023-07-03 12:44:03 not initially
general 2023-07-03 12:44:14 but if ww3 begins conventionally it can 100% escalate to nuclear war
general 2023-07-03 12:44:42 its like that one shredder kid in PVP who keeps dying so decides to crash the whole server
general 2023-07-03 12:45:36 a few hundred is all they need to cripple the leading western nations
general 2023-07-03 12:45:46 thats out of 5k known nuclear weapons
general 2023-07-03 12:45:54 so it doesnt matter if most of them dont work
general 2023-07-03 12:46:38 article 5 doesnt have to be nuclear though
general 2023-07-03 12:46:46 could just involve nato sending troops to ukraine
general 2023-07-03 12:47:00 or full on american invasion of western russia
general 2023-07-03 12:47:23 yes
general 2023-07-03 12:47:28 but if one side starts to lose
general 2023-07-03 12:47:30 they mald and nuke everyone

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:05:06 maneuvorability is important
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:05:38 u dont need armor if u dont get hit
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:05:57 tnt cannon doesnt work in pc
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:06:03 they bounce off without exploding until a second later
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:06:49 you can have a tnt machinegun and have it still be completely useless

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:07:11 tnt can oneshot tanks but it wont do anything if it doesnt trigger at all
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:07:26 try shooting one of these at a tank and you get the same result bro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:07:49 i've been testing this for a year
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:07:54 on impact doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:08:16 why didnt u just say that
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:08:22 https://tenor.com/view/head-deformed-deformed-head-gif-12063868
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:08:44 the problem is
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:08:55 you can only shoot so many rounds with manual
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:09:28 10 gun as a coax and rocket spam works
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:09:46 if u can get a macro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:09:50 u can get full auto rockets lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:10:33 that works
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:10:36 but id rather press 1 key
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:11:04 do you know what a macro is
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:11:50 either tsunami or aftersock said they were fine a while ago
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:11:57 theyre not considered exploits
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:12:20 it wouldnt make sense for them to change their stance all of a sudden
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:12:43 people autoclick on simulator games all the time
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:12:56 no ones been banned for having an autoclicker
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:00 and what
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:15 ...yes it is
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:21 i just asked you if you knew what a macro was
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:29 🤦‍♂️
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:36 an autoclicker is a type of macro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:13:59 man u dont even need razer synapse
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:14:29 but do you realise that autoclickers are a type of macro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:14:36 its a macro designed to click automatically
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:14:42 its not hard to understand bro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:15:01 macros just automate user inputs
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:15:09 no one has been banned for autoclicking
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:15:17 meanwhile there have been banwaves against people with FPS unlockers
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:15:36 im explaining further
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:16:04 it has happened before
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:16:51 shaders objectively change the game more than a macro does
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:17:03 so ye macros are fine in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:17:43 thats not a macro
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 13:17:47 thats a straight up exploit
general 2023-07-06 13:21:00 rick is alive now
general 2023-07-06 13:21:14 wouldve been valid if he stayed dead and stopped working on the game
general 2023-07-06 13:21:37 his statement wouldve been valid

general 2023-07-07 19:46:13 maid rickje shoulder pal
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:31 u get banned for discussing getting exploits here
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:59 wasnt talking to you anyway so get fucked
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:03 if you dont like it leave
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:09 L + ratio
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:54 there was a guy who had a legitimately non-harmful exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:01 and aftershock didnt want to ban him but its the rules
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:04 so he got 1984ed
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:46 yea ur good lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:51:11 literally this guy who got banned today
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:51:32 is it not an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:51:49 apparently still works
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:08 best, worst, doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:09 it's an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:49 not hard to figure out
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:15 still doesnt justify exploiting
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:35 so you are advocating for exploiting because bans can be circumvented?
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:46 sure but a copyscript literally steals people's builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:53 and thats what you are advocating for
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:10 what
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:13 no it doesnt
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:21 roshade is purely clientsided
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:23 it injects nothing
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:59 fair
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:56:10 but u still cant say u own even harmless exploits here
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:56:21 in what way
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:56:28 what does whizify's shaders do differently to the others
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:14 injectors and executors arent interchangeable
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:19 because it uses an executor doesnt mean its an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:55 does whizify's have freecam
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:58:24 i mean
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:58:29 freecam is still clientsided
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:59:26 shaders is where the line is drawn
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:59:27 iirc
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:59:39 whiz's freecam is technically an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:59:44 but in the context of plane crazy it changes nothing
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:00:23 we need a cinematic viewmode in plane crazy 2

general 2023-07-10 19:00:18 kids learn swear words and use every opportunity to use them
general 2023-07-10 19:00:30 the only good swear words are racial slurs
general 2023-07-10 19:01:06 they dont use them as fillers though
general 2023-07-10 19:03:06 just because its noticeably excessive doesnt mean its zerchy's fault

general 2023-07-10 20:00:41 things such as savantism are incredibly rare side effects
general 2023-07-10 20:01:06 a rarity though

general 2023-07-10 21:50:27 calling a build ass is barely criticism
general 2023-07-10 21:50:52 this guy gave a genuine critique and got upvotes
general 2023-07-10 21:51:03 but i still agree that pcc reddit is even shitter than this server
general 2023-07-10 21:51:31 💀
general 2023-07-10 21:52:28 why is the pcc reddit so unmoderated
general 2023-07-10 21:52:44 its cool, but still gets u banned
general 2023-07-10 21:56:18 you have to admit
general 2023-07-10 21:56:23 its more useful than saying the whole thing is ass
general 2023-07-10 21:57:04 it can be
general 2023-07-10 21:57:13 i dont advise posting in <#384025409945337856> if you're new though
general 2023-07-10 21:57:19 thats what most whitenames jump into straight away
general 2023-07-10 21:57:23 without consulting <#478584971670454284> first

general 2023-07-11 10:32:37 ???
general 2023-07-11 10:32:56 custom clients are against TOS not because it "messes up with discord code"
general 2023-07-11 10:33:58 betterdiscord plugins arent hacker tools but ok
general 2023-07-11 10:34:24 the real reasons is because 
1. capitalism

creations-chat 2023-07-11 10:47:05 which means nothing in relation to what i said
what is your argument lol
general 2023-07-11 10:47:39 <@636445104118431746> talk here
general 2023-07-11 10:47:43 the slowmode is stupid

creations-chat 2023-07-11 10:50:22 wow you missed my point so hard you might as well fly to the moon now.

people arent obligated to give feedback. because people can talk about his build here does not mean they want to, otherwise they would have already.
he has no right to mass ping everyone who downvoted his build

general 2023-07-13 00:14:46 vaccines cause autism
this is why pcc is autistic
general 2023-07-13 00:15:09 only the second sentence is true
general 2023-07-13 00:15:46 “what is a man”
general 2023-07-13 00:16:00 doctors as soon as a male kid is born:
general 2023-07-13 00:17:23 a man is someone born with the XY chromosome pair
general 2023-07-13 00:18:55 generally speaking
general 2023-07-13 00:19:06 the majority of men have XY
general 2023-07-13 00:19:12 chromosomal abnormalities do happen
general 2023-07-13 00:19:15 that is a rare exception
general 2023-07-13 00:19:27 if you are purely XY
general 2023-07-13 00:19:30 you cannot be a woman
general 2023-07-13 00:20:16 are you suggesting XY makes someone a woman
general 2023-07-13 00:21:20 male/female is assigned at birth
general 2023-07-13 00:22:07 a man *must* have the Y chromosome
general 2023-07-13 00:23:20 <@407347404858458123> lets spin this logic quickly
What is a human?
general 2023-07-13 00:24:10 lol
general 2023-07-13 00:24:29 type that out again
general 2023-07-13 00:25:23 …we don’t know what a human is
general 2023-07-13 00:25:25 awesome
general 2023-07-13 00:25:42 dont even know if they exist
general 2023-07-13 00:26:33 now the problem is you need a long winded explanation to come up with an objective answer to an obvious question
general 2023-07-13 00:26:39 is that not true
general 2023-07-13 00:28:27 how do we argue with someone who unironically states that we dont know what a human is
general 2023-07-13 00:28:35 wrap it up guys
general 2023-07-13 00:28:41 this is going to go in circles
general 2023-07-13 00:29:54 is there a single person out of the 8 billion alive that constitute as not human
general 2023-07-13 00:35:58 thought we were speaking about biology. if you need outdated 3000 year old philosophy involving flawed logic to argue science and well established definitions then you dont have a credible argument.
general 2023-07-13 00:38:56 science is the evolution to philosophy. its based on empirical evidence which philosophy is often not
general 2023-07-13 00:39:10 philosophy is subjective by nature
general 2023-07-13 00:41:38 exactly. which is why its wrong to demand an objective answer to a question and argue against it using philosophy
general 2023-07-13 00:43:34 you’re the one overwriting a baseline scientific answer with subjectiveness lol
general 2023-07-13 00:45:26 okay so what is your objective standard to a man
general 2023-07-13 00:45:34 a human
general 2023-07-13 00:45:36 a person
general 2023-07-13 00:46:49 like I said science is based upon empirical evidence. does philosophy use empirical evidence?
general 2023-07-13 00:47:00 okay a monkey is a human
general 2023-07-13 00:48:25 ok
general 2023-07-13 00:48:36 (not)
general 2023-07-13 00:49:34 so you detract from the whole gender argument and say that humanity cannot define a single thing
general 2023-07-13 00:49:36 LMAO
