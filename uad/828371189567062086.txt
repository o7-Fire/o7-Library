general 2021-06-11 21:44:45 dude
general 2021-06-11 21:44:58 there is something that’s been spreading
general 2021-06-11 21:45:06 it’s like a boss version of the shredder bug
general 2021-06-11 21:45:08 and faster
general 2021-06-11 21:45:14 and basically so much worse
general 2021-06-11 21:46:06 do you all know what an ‘Omni Shredder’ is
general 2021-06-11 21:46:23 *sigh*
general 2021-06-11 21:46:29 Do you hate shredder bugs?
general 2021-06-11 21:47:26 What if I told you a new version of it has popped up, and it can shred all around it 360 degrees in a full sphere, can reach up to 800 MPH, Way more durable and way more easier to control
general 2021-06-11 21:47:42 And it’s the size of an entire plot
general 2021-06-11 21:48:10 no
general 2021-06-11 21:48:13 not that
general 2021-06-11 21:48:24 it’s a variant of the shredder sphere
general 2021-06-11 21:48:49 Do you all know the
general 2021-06-11 21:49:08 Black Hole build where it rotates like Infinitely fast
general 2021-06-11 21:50:18 Imagine a few months later a ‘black hole shredder’ will pop up
general 2021-06-11 21:52:59 Has anyone in this game made a working railgun that actually relies on kinetic energy yet
general 2021-06-11 21:53:15 as in
general 2021-06-11 21:53:22 the projectile delivers kinetic energy
general 2021-06-11 21:53:25 not boom boom
general 2021-06-11 21:53:27 or anything
general 2021-06-11 21:53:46 and not cutters
general 2021-06-11 21:54:02 and not exploits
general 2021-06-11 21:59:22 ERA13 Kinetic Cutter Railgun
->relies on a complex set of machinery and suspensions in order to create a high powered rear slingshot perfectly aimed at the back of the projectile
->the projectile should be decently long to decrease flinging upon impact, and would use a spearhead comprised of cutters
->should be able to one shot a small creation if it hits
general 2021-06-11 22:00:03 make this and I give you a tips jar
general 2021-06-11 22:01:49 who wants a tips jar
general 2021-06-11 22:02:19 ERA13 Kinetic Cutter Railgun
->relies on a complex set of machinery and suspensions in order to create a high powered rear slingshot perfectly aimed at the back of the projectile
->the projectile should be decently long to decrease flinging upon impact, and would use a spearhead comprised of cutters

make this and I’ll give you a Tips Jar
general 2021-06-11 22:08:14 who ‘ere wants a challenge that if they complete they get a reward
general 2021-06-11 22:10:30 <@!621817208313479248> want a challenge?
general 2021-06-11 22:11:26 here
general 2021-06-11 22:12:16 ERA13 Kinetic Cutter Railgun
->relies on a complex set of machinery and suspensions in order to create a high powered rear slingshot perfectly aimed at the back of the projectile
->the machinery should be internal covered by a shell of sleek metal that makes it actually resemble a high tech railgun
->the projectile should be decently long to decrease flinging upon impact, and would use a spearhead comprised of cutters
->should be able to one shot a small creation if it hits

complete it and I’ll give you a Tips Jar
general 2021-06-11 22:12:49 nah
general 2021-06-11 22:12:58 I specialise in guided missiles
general 2021-06-11 22:13:02 Railguns are less practical
general 2021-06-11 22:13:12 I’m bored
general 2021-06-11 22:13:17 and want to see
general 2021-06-11 22:13:21 if it’s possible
general 2021-06-11 22:13:53 .-.
general 2021-06-11 22:14:34 are we not gonna talk about how you can use the spike stalagmite thingy to troll people

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:00:39 hello
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:00:49 I just made a tnt railgun
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:01:01 it can like
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:01:13 penetrate a vehicle and then it explodes in it
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:01:24 cool right
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:02:25 you don’t
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:02:30 just make an orbital strike
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:03:42 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:20 well I know a guy that specialises in building sci fi things and can change colour of his bullets
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:23 so maybe
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:47 he made a laser railgun thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:51 it shoots blue bullets
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:05:06 I have proof
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:05:33 ok one sec
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:06:44 https://youtu.be/59Rnz5S3nlU
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:07:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:07:57 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:08:04 let me show you another one
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:08:20 https://youtu.be/EmH-njW_oh4
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:09:28 then make one yourself
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:36:19 hmm
bot-central 2021-06-12 13:36:23 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:37:16 anyone here with a railgun
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:37:21 That actually does damage

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:40:06 railgun penetration
general 2021-06-13 22:49:43 Look on the bright side, at least you didn’t build a 5 sphere omni shredder like I did

general 2021-06-16 23:05:50 wouldn’t work probably, next thing you know the shredders evolve to adapt to the environment and use some sort of spinny gun propeller shredder
