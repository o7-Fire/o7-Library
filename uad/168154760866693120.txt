creations-chat 2018-11-29 21:30:03 The YG-262M was made, loosely based on the Me-262, but in my own odd turn
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 22:35:54 nobody better make that heckin SF40
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 22:35:59 that will be the end of planes

plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:27:30 I have an idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:30:06 im adding two "pontoons"
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:32:25

plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:50:48 if the speed demon ranks didnt exclude helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:50:59 id be the 2nd highest rank

plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:58:01 500k
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 06:58:17 im stopping at 500
creations-chat 2018-12-01 06:59:36 Easiest way to make make your build to look like abstract art
creations-chat 2018-12-01 06:59:54 Highest speed was 510,000, and still climbing
creations-chat 2018-12-01 07:02:20 the idea was to make a balloon above it
creations-chat 2018-12-01 07:02:23 but it didnt go that way
creations-chat 2018-12-01 07:02:31 i didnt expect helium to be that strong
creations-chat 2018-12-01 17:17:16 okay question. How in the fuck is that a Pe-8?...
creations-chat 2018-12-01 17:17:50 looks like a G4M1 or the Japanese bombers
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 17:21:11 ***1273 DOWN TO ROCKEFELLER STREET***
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 17:21:40 *intense almost-vertical dabbing*
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 17:22:12 so am I
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 17:22:25 im gonna move to War Thunder soon tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 17:25:10 Time to go grind the La-5 in War Thunder
general 2018-12-01 17:27:04 I'm going to grind the Russians
general 2018-12-01 17:27:08 in War Thunder
general 2018-12-01 17:27:15 get that sexy ass La-5
general 2018-12-01 17:27:28 *Yonko*

general 2018-12-01 17:29:35 Got some Sabaton playing
general 2018-12-01 17:29:46 might decide to move to Tank RB after I get the La-5
general 2018-12-01 17:29:58 Take my IS-6 into top tier and take out Abrams
general 2018-12-01 17:38:11 LOL
general 2018-12-01 17:38:16 YOU'RE SO BRAINWASHED TO THINK THAT
general 2018-12-01 17:38:23 It's not even slightly fucking true! lmao
general 2018-12-01 17:38:28 I play Russia, and I'm American
general 2018-12-01 17:38:35 I've played every country
general 2018-12-01 17:38:43 If anything, right now, top tier USA is the most bias.
general 2018-12-01 17:38:49 Middle tier Germany owns that
general 2018-12-01 17:38:54 Low tier German owns that
general 2018-12-01 17:39:08 Russian bias doesnt fucking exist.
general 2018-12-01 17:39:18 Okay Russian planes are different than German
general 2018-12-01 17:39:35 I couldnt outturn a british spitfire with my Yak-7B
general 2018-12-01 17:39:51 and my Yak-7B has amazing fucking climbing ability

creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:43:02 To see Tiger 1
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:45:56 Listening to ***M E G A L O V A N I A*** while you work on a bomber
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:47:34 my question is
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:47:39 should I go with 2 different bays
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:47:43 or go with a single bay
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:00:28 bruv
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:00:32 That's a 747?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:02:56 it looks like a white dildo my man
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:02:58 <:dab:510869696791445525>
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:03:13 I mean I'm not perfect either, but atleast look at a reference of the 747
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:03:46 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Pan_Am_Boeing_747-121_N732PA_Bidini.jpg/1200px-Pan_Am_Boeing_747-121_N732PA_Bidini.jpg
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:02 look in <#384025409945337856> and look at the two
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:24 I LEGIT FEEL BAD FOR YOUR BUILD
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:36 IT'S LIKE THE BOEING 747 THAT COULD
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:43 HE TRIED TO BE A LEGIT AIRLINER
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:04 LMAO
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:47 From playing alot of Simpleplanes and games like it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:52 I've gotten used to how to make a plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:07:51 time to go play War Thunder again
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:07:58 I got tired of trying to think of ways to make a bomber
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:08:00 in PC
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:35:38 Claw wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:35:54 Where they sweep back then curve forwards
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:41:25 OOO
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:41:30 WHO MADE THE RACING DRONE
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:41:38 FUCKING MEMORIES. ACCELERACERS
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:51:20 No
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:51:36 I see that Swastika
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:52:13 It is
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:53:08 .-.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:53:22 I wasn’t gonna have much issue, but since you’re lying about it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 16:53:27 Now I have an issue with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 16:54:55 Someone made a swastika in their build and lied about it. Saying it’s not a swastika
general 2018-12-03 16:55:21 
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 16:55:33 Clockwise
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 16:55:37 It’s a swastika
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 16:55:49 Look in <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-12-03 16:56:00 The guy typing is the one that posted it
general 2018-12-03 16:56:26 The name is Germany multi tasked
general 2018-12-03 16:56:29 Tasker*
general 2018-12-03 16:56:34 It was intentional
general 2018-12-03 16:56:42 Look in creations chat. He even lies
general 2018-12-03 16:56:49 Saying it’s not a swastika
general 2018-12-03 16:57:01 It was fully intentional. Clearly.
general 2018-12-03 16:57:20 As I said if he didn’t lie about it being a swastika, I wouldn’t have had too big of an issue
general 2018-12-03 16:57:29 I know that.
general 2018-12-03 16:57:37 But it’s not the swastika with the dots now is it?
general 2018-12-03 16:58:44 This is the good swastika, that i believe means love and peace.
general 2018-12-03 17:00:06 But either way, the guy made it intentionally, no one would make a design like that, and name it Germany. If it wasn’t a swastika
general 2018-12-03 17:01:42 Aren’t mods only discord
general 2018-12-03 17:01:45 And not game mods
general 2018-12-03 17:01:53 Eh. <@163143541160148992>
general 2018-12-03 17:07:49 Since no one has responded, tag me if this is taken care of
general 2018-12-03 17:21:50 Ik
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:29:19 When I get home from school
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:29:24 Ima work on a bomber I’m making
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:29:31 Idk what I want it to drop
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:29:35 Bombs or balls
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:36:09 I REMEMBER. The funnest thing to do back in **Welcome to roblox building** was to build a massive tower and delete the bottom block
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:36:15 The tower just falls into other plots
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:51:32 Lol there’s a guy in Gmod who made his own mini company thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:51:54 And the idea of a company reminds me of his little empire
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:52:20 I should make a Plane Crazy group. Like. It’s a discord and it’s devoted to a “country”
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:52:34 And that country makes builds and shit in PC, and expands
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:53:35 I should do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:54:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:54:40 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:54:43 I’ve never heard of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:02 Can I actually make a discord for something like this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:08 Have a discord for Plane Community Countries
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:19 And it has groups of people that go into PVP and have wars
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:37 Not IRL countries
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:47 But little gangs that would be little militias
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:55:50 And would fight
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:58:54 When Rickje comes in here I’m gonna ask about the country things
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:59:00 It could be little factions for PC
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:59:38 Honestly if I do that, then the idea would be blown up and I would never get anything for it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:59:53 Ima make a discord for a PC country and have a military
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:03:42 A massive landship with a turret
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:04:18 I did that on a plane I made
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:04:41 Made a 2-gun turret on a small bomber I made
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:52:30 Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:52:57 make a Fw-190 escorting a damaged B-17 that has a broken 3rd engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:53:04 aka Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:54:18 anyone that shrugs off the story needs to commit scooter ankle
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:07:22 ah, Bf109
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:07:30 I had a feeling I was wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:14:23 A-10
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:14:36 25-30mm GAU cannon
general 2018-12-04 15:51:58 Heck yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:56:06 My preference for controls
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:57:23 W/S - Pitch
A/D - Roll
Q/E - Yaw
Up/Down - Throttle
Numpad */Numpad (minus) - Bombay doors
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:57:29 So far that’s all I’ve needed
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:02:38 
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:02:41 Hm
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:02:53 I’m trying to think of a good build idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:02:56 But I’m at a loss
creations-chat 2018-12-05 17:04:35 Give a top view of that
creations-chat 2018-12-05 17:04:44 Cause that looks **FAR** from a SR-71
general 2018-12-06 20:48:04 
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 23:18:05 uh... am need help!

plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:26:28 towards the top right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:26:30 of the picture?
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:57:22 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:57:25 still working on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:57:33 MIGHT add a 3rd section
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:08:53 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:08:59 Feel like I need to make it longer
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:09:23 it's at 444 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:11:50 oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:16:49 **OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF**
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:33:59 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:34:13 807 blocks now
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:34:50 So far I'm liking this carrier I'm making
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:34:58 I might make some weird ass bridge on the side of the ship
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:08 ik
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:13 but I'm making it thick
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:20 so small planes can land
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:30 it's 17 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:44 Well It's my first carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:35:50 so gimme some slack
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:36:06 this is the first time I've tried folding
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:36:10 and it's a wide ship
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:36:17 okay but you're making it thin
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:36:23 I'm making my carrier fat
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:37:10 Okay at this point it feels like you're mocking me.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:37:23 It's my FIRST TRY.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:37:29 Overtime I'll change it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:37:40 Give me a fucking break. Jesus.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:37:42 No, fuck off.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:38:01 Just gonna block those two and move on and build it how I want to build it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:39:40 it doesnt matter what it looks like. it's decent for a first fucking try. I've already spent like 2 hours on it. and I managed to make a successful fold, after a few tries.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:39:51 Give me some slack, christ.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:00 Everyone builds differently
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:05 I'd rather have room for things
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:11 Room > Folds for me.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:26 Yeah and one of them is a damn MOD.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:45 makes me feel like this is the UDU server, except the mods are subtly rude.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:40:53 instead of blatant
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:41:34 You don't know if I want to make a little elevator or some shit with a small plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:41:42 actually, that's a good idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:41:52 I should save the first variation of this carrier when it's done
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:41:57 then try to make an elevator
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:42:18 I could make each section like
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:42:22 3-5 blocks wider
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:42:48 Well I want a WW2 based carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:43:13 it would be nice if we had like, rails or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:01 plus I'm at 807 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:05 that's alot of blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:15 my largest plane was around 500-600
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:30 stop flexing
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:48 you're a mod dude, and you're flexing on a **NEW PLAYER**
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:44:56 IQ 100
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:45:06 oops, I mean 10
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:45:07 sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:45:31 literally after I said my carrier is 807, you post your ship being 4k
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:45:45 but it's a flex
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:45:56 if I was building something other than a ship, i wouldnt care
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:47:55 B-17...
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:01 looks like a P-51
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:08 and a P-47
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:14 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:15 really?
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:25 that back one looks like a P-47
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:48:38 and yeah I see the TBF now
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:49:22 hm
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:49:27 I do see it
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:57:29 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:57:56 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:58:03 first try at a carrier in this game
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:58:20 I rather make a square
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:58:30 than something more complicated
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:58:36 especially since I have plans for the inside, possibly
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:58:48 That's modern
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:59:08 I'm making a WW2 based carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:59:17 Jail is high on something
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:59:42 dude really
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 06:59:49 he made a ton of swastikas
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:00:00 it has the blue lines around the base
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:01:51 atleast he didnt lie about it being swastikas
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:05 Now I mean, if he made the OLD swastika, with the dots
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:09 then I'd be okay with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:17 since the old swastika meant good fortune
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:40 yep
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:48 they didnt reverse it
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:51 they just tilted it
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:03:53 and removed the dots
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:12:05 I've been sitting here for 5-10 mins
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:12:08 thinking of what to do
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:12:11 now I remember
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:12:14 propulsion
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:32:31 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 07:32:32

creations-chat 2018-12-08 08:14:32 
creations-chat 2018-12-08 08:15:44 Small carrier. over 1k blocks. max speed about 20 SPS, will be updated and changed later in the future. made longer and wider.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:17:14 rickie I hope pistons aren’t glitchy
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:17:24 I might add an elevator to my shit carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:18:03 I’ll probably try adding an elevator to this
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:18:31 Cause I wanted the runway to be large
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:18:36 So I put it on the side
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:19:09 I’m gonna consider making my Carrier bigger
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 21:19:30 Probably make it fold downwards or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:10 I’m gonna rebuild my carrier tonight when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:17 I’m gonna make it longer and a tad thinner
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:25 Instead of 17 wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:31 I’ll make it like 13 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:52 Or I might make a thicket Carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:56 And have a plane inside
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:06:59 Thicker*
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:08:29 I made a little turret that will sit in the water. It has a base to it that gets extended out
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:10:21 I have a few ideas for builds
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:22:21 Hold on.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:22:22 Hold on.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:22:41 Aw fuck

plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:38:55 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:39:45 Me when I see turrets. And I have my jet plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:40:24 Why is all the Roblox Racing Community people joining.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:40:55 RRC is the most cancer in roblox between those valley people who put ugly ass realistic makeup faces on R15 3.0 models
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:41:15 Tyson isn’t, but Fox and respiration are
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:41:25 Oh god
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:41:51 Wtf
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:41:55 Two people with the same PFP
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:42:21 Jesus Christ what’s happening
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:43:06 Pirate you’re not cool. If you want to be cool, well. Try harder. Build something amazing.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:44:01 Can I ask how the RRC found this server. Cause now more and more of the same cancer is going to join. And this is far from racing too.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:44:20 Roblox Racing Community
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:46:07 *”UDRC”*
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:46:16 Please tell me that’s fake
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:46:53 I bet you are a member of some stupid UDRC group
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:48:29 Pirate if you’re gonna talk about JC, do it in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:48:59 This isn’t JC, this is Plane Crazy, and <#384021699466756107> is for Plane Crazy Chat. Not Japan Circuits
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:49:58 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:50:06 jc. Japan Circuits.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:52:05 He literally doesn’t even fucking care. I’m just gonna block the three of them. Since it’s evident they’re probably here to spread their cancer and get more cancer like them into here. I bet fucking Telafag will join too.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:54:27 For anyone who doesn’t understand why I’m so hostile. Pirate and Tyson are from a group of Roblox players that play racing games. And most of the people in said group are assholes. And insensitive. And cancer. Including who i dub telafag. If I insult either of the two, I was harassed by this group a lot.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:54:47 It brings back bad memories.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:55:43 See. There he is saying shit about me having a map that was leaked.
general 2018-12-08 23:57:46 Now with racing people here I feel like this place is going to become just like the Heavy Clutch discord
general 2018-12-08 23:57:54 I won’t be able to say anything without someone insulting me
general 2018-12-08 23:58:12 Even subtly and indirectly insulting me.
general 2018-12-08 23:58:40 That community hates me, when all I fucking did was try to be fair and make it more community and not competitive
general 2018-12-09 00:05:24 I don’t like the sight of blocked messages here. I really don’t
general 2018-12-09 00:06:03 Due to those toxic people, I’m forced to see it. And have flashbacks of times that caused me countless mental breakdowns and endless pain.
general 2018-12-09 00:41:29 It does. Of all places. And of all games they come here. I really hope they leave.

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:16:36 I posted the actual 747
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:16:54 To show the nuthead that made that white dildo
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:16:59 That he clearly didn’t make a 747
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:17:23 It was literally a rectangular dildo
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:17:29 With glass on the front
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:21:34 Lol. I can get away with calling a guy’s build a dildo.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:21:43 But these guys are being warned for saying the real thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:32:46 When did I join discord?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:33:04 Oh, April 2016
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:33:24 Lmao, after midnight too
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 05:38:51 I'm gonna try and make a landing boat

general 2018-12-14 07:22:04 Let me note that normal Research points is like 30k or less
general 2018-12-14 07:22:11 So to get over a fucking million...
general 2018-12-14 07:22:17 And to see how LITTLE 30k is
general 2018-12-14 07:22:20 It’s absurd
general 2018-12-14 16:34:24 Imagine a legit fucking FedEx truck with wings strapped to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 02:57:02 Does anyone have suggestions on something to build

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:04:39 we're in the primary ommunity vip
creations-chat 2018-12-16 20:27:08 Apache?...
creations-chat 2018-12-16 20:27:40 More like the Comanche or Blackshark
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:35:59 but upvoting your own creation means you like it...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:36:01 So...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:36:06 Your logic is flawed there bud.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:36:32 If I like my own creation or suggestion, I'll upvote it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:39:16 I'm gonna continue to upvote my own things if I like it, if I think i built shit, i wont upvote it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:39:37 I'm not breaking any rules, so.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:39:59 Plus I mean, it's a single upvote
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:40:14 and most of the time nobody gets more than 5 upvotes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:02 Now I'm banned from posting creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:03 ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:10 Hope you guys dont mind me posting my creations here!
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:26 I got one I actually want to show off, that I spent a couple of hours on
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:51 look at my name color
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:41:55 "Creations Ban"
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:08 ^
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:11 Exactly.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:20 To punish one person is stupidity at it's finest.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:42 Everyone will upvote themselves. It's given.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:55 but that's a SINGLE UPVOTE... that doesnt mean others have to upvote.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:43:40 You guys think that one person posting and adding a upvote to their creation, will give them 20 upvotes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:43:50 Dude, my builds look like shit lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:44:03 I DOUBT anyone would give me upvotes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:44:33 But I'll still upvote myself, cause maybe people will look at my builds again, and reconsider if they like it. That's why I do it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:11 and Jameson once again twisting what I'm saying.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:36 I'm gonna stop talking, since the mods seem to not understand what I'm saying.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:53 Okay.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:55 I post something
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:57 I upvote it

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:46:07 looking at creations

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:47:10 other people probably do it for more biased reasons than me
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:47:30 lucky, that would be unfair for everyone else
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:47:33 as like everyone does it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:02 Lucky, you know that would FLOOD these channels
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:03 right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:08 Cause EVERYBODY
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:12 would be getting a verbal warning
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:18 As I GUARANTEE
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:21 alot of people do it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:35 And once people get warned for what they will probably see as BS,
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:40 people will get more salty
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:42 and itll cause issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:48:48 fucking leave it at this

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 02:34:47 But they had to have been going HELLA SLOW for it to just plop on the ground like that and have the wings not snap off

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:45:45 if I had to design a legit ejection system
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:45:48 for a heli
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:45:59 I'd have things that extend or eject into the blades
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:46:05 to break them, before the pilot is ejected
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:46:21 or maybe just yeet the blades off themselves

plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:23:19 lol in a Garry's Mod server I'm an Admin for, if you LTAP (Leave To Avoid Punishment), you get a week ban automatically. and if you do it again, and I find you, you're getting 4 weeks from me.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:24:05 well we don't really have "warning" roles
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:24:16 our "warning" is a jailtp
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:24:27 ```!jailtp [user] 120```
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:24:36 teleports the- let's go to <#497142796961054721>

general 2018-12-21 03:25:01 in the server I work for
general 2018-12-21 03:25:10 teleports the user to us
general 2018-12-21 03:25:17 and jails them for 120 seconds
general 2018-12-21 03:25:32 if they leave
general 2018-12-21 03:25:33 it's LTAP
general 2018-12-21 03:25:53 ik
general 2018-12-21 03:30:26 2 mins is enough time
general 2018-12-21 03:31:46 the idea of it is a warning
general 2018-12-21 03:31:57 it's our only form of "warning"
general 2018-12-21 03:32:10 or a verbal "hey stop that"
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:44:31 you know i thought abcd making laggy light builds was laggy
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:44:42 but now imperial (i think) has a rope storm out
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:48:53 You thought it was abcd lagging the server, but no! It was me! Imperial! ```Dio intensifies```

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:21:20 dude you do that again im blacklisting you <@!99607451300548608>
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:21:54 and all of the blocks landed on my plot
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:22:00 while im tryna build
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:23:58 
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:24:02 and at the current state,
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:24:24 will be lifted using only propellers and helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:24:48 It started off as a quadcopter
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:24:58 but now I'm making it more steampunk
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:25:31 it's gonna have 8 blades
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:25:38 also it has 2 on the back
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:25:42 for forward/backward
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:26:51 lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:26:57 as i said
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:03 it's becoming more steampunk
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:09 I will probably use this for ranks too
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:19 and even the bombardier rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:24 cause the inside is so spacious
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:33 come over to my plot and check the inside out
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:27:54 thats right your plot is next to mine
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:30:43 yah

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 07:50:29 main vip
creations-chat 2018-12-23 07:56:53 
creations-chat 2018-12-23 07:57:08 Requesting some sort of rank for this, no engines, only props and helium.
creations-chat 2018-12-23 08:04:29 I'm going to request:

- Expert Steampunk Engineer: The design CAN be lifted using only helium, I just have the propellers there because I want some form of moving part. Makes it look cooler.
- Master Technician: The design CAN take off or land vertically, and it's NOT a helicopter.
- Modeller: This is a stretch, but it's a unique design. Not Jameson unique, but unique. Two large tubes on either side, with 4 blades per tube, and two massive props on the back for thrust. But again, this one ***IS*** a stretch
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 18:51:52 Yeetus
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 18:53:16 I got two new ranks yeetus

plane-crazy 2018-12-27 06:39:09 I legit closed discord and had to open it back up to deal with his stupidity
general 2018-12-29 13:18:45 I don’t understand the Orange joke...
general 2018-12-29 13:19:22 I don’t get the joke at all
general 2018-12-29 13:19:56 Like, what’s so special about it... why will it guarantee a warn?...
general 2018-12-29 13:21:14 Oh
general 2018-12-29 13:21:17 I see
general 2018-12-29 13:23:04 I just logged on after not giving a fuck pretty much
general 2018-12-29 13:23:10 For like a few days
general 2018-12-29 13:23:17 And I see that, and am confused
general 2018-12-29 13:35:05 Anyone play War Thunder
general 2018-12-29 13:35:31 If anyone does, and reads this. Best thing to do when playing Russian planes
general 2018-12-29 13:35:52 Listen to this on SoundCloud
general 2018-12-29 13:36:08 Whenever I’m playing my La-5FN, in Air RB, this is what I listen to.
general 2018-12-29 13:36:17 And I guarantee it helps my performance
general 2018-12-29 13:36:33 If anyone actually pays attention to War Thunder
general 2018-12-29 13:36:44 This song is the song that was obviously in the Victory is Ours trailer
general 2018-12-29 13:36:49 And the plane in the trailer
general 2018-12-29 13:37:09 That stalls out onto the German Bf-109 (I think)
general 2018-12-29 13:37:14 Is the La-5FN.
general 2018-12-29 13:37:44 And this is why I don’t like people
general 2018-12-29 13:38:25 Sitting here trying to educate some fellow WT bros, and this retard with his hot pink girly fucking name comes up “yuh how bout dem fuken wookees?”
general 2018-12-29 13:39:07 Man people. I’m told to converse with people and make friends
general 2018-12-29 13:39:27 Man fuck that lol! Other people can fuckin’ burn in Hell for all I care.
general 2018-12-29 13:41:21 I piss off the people that can’t do shit
general 2018-12-29 13:41:31 But I don’t piss off people that can actually do something
general 2018-12-29 13:42:14 I’m not a toxic player
general 2018-12-29 13:42:24 I’m an honest and trustworthy player
general 2018-12-29 13:42:34 Yelling for help? If I can help I’ll do all I can
general 2018-12-29 13:42:40 Even if it means taking a shell
general 2018-12-29 13:43:03 But if I see you being a tard, in high Tier
general 2018-12-29 13:43:07 I’m gonna call you out on it
general 2018-12-29 13:43:43 How the fuck do you troll people by calling them out for being shit at the game
general 2018-12-29 13:44:03 Did you read what I said
general 2018-12-29 13:44:09 Did I ever say I ran them
general 2018-12-29 13:44:14 Ram*
general 2018-12-29 13:44:32 I play my IS-6 at TOP TIER
general 2018-12-29 13:44:44 And guaranteed I’m better than 80% of the players in any match I play.
general 2018-12-29 13:44:49 At least
general 2018-12-29 13:44:51 Russian side
general 2018-12-29 13:45:15 90% of the top tier Russian players assume “oh I got T-80. Rush B Blyat”
general 2018-12-29 13:45:37 Then they get fucking royally ass fucked by Abrams and IPM1’s
general 2018-12-29 13:45:57 So our 10 T-80’s? Pft. 5 minutes in its down to 2.
general 2018-12-29 13:46:10 And half the team already went to the hangar
general 2018-12-29 13:46:31 I can do more damage at top tier in my IS-6
general 2018-12-29 13:46:35 Than I do at 7.0
general 2018-12-29 13:47:15 The IS-6 has an APHEBC Shell, which at 0 meters, and on 0° angled armor
general 2018-12-29 13:47:28 Can penetrate up to 207 millimeters of armor
general 2018-12-29 13:47:47 Meaning an Abrams presenting its side to Me, is a one shot kill
general 2018-12-29 13:48:07 Any tank presenting it’s side to the IS-6 will die.
general 2018-12-29 13:48:11 Any tank, guaranteed
general 2018-12-29 13:48:23 No, it’s been nerfed already
general 2018-12-29 13:48:28 Back when it first was dropped
general 2018-12-29 13:48:42 The front armor at 7.3
general 2018-12-29 13:48:53 Could not be penetrated at all, besides a mantle shot
general 2018-12-29 13:49:02 That was when it first appeared
general 2018-12-29 13:49:26 They nerfed it, back then only other IS-6 players knew where to shoot
general 2018-12-29 13:49:32 Also I hope you know
general 2018-12-29 13:49:36 In War Thunder
general 2018-12-29 13:49:41 MBT’s are seen as top dogs
general 2018-12-29 13:49:52 But any tank can take their crew out on the side
general 2018-12-29 13:50:04 Their sides are THIN
general 2018-12-29 13:50:07 paper thin
general 2018-12-29 13:50:23 Got a tiny Stuart with a 37mm gun? Yeah that’ll go through
general 2018-12-29 13:51:08 I’ve been playing it very on and off for the past 2 years
general 2018-12-29 13:51:16 I just love history and war
general 2018-12-29 13:51:50 So to have a game that I can fly Hind’s around, drive tanks, drop massive bombs and obliterate every-fucking-thing in sight....
general 2018-12-29 13:51:59 It’s perfect!
general 2018-12-29 13:52:22 Russian Pe-8 bomber with a 5,000 kg bomb
general 2018-12-29 13:52:34 You can kill 10 destroyers

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:41:45 I had a killer idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:42:07 it was gonna be a little ice car, and it was going to use skis to turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:42:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:42:38 but turning the skis does nothing
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 00:04:19 oh, VIP 1 is dead

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 22:59:56 I do want to some day make a massive carrier with like 6-7 people
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:00:14 Each of us make a section of it, which can connect to another section
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:01:48 You don’t understand what I mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:01:59 I mean we each make a section of the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:02:03 Then put them together
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:02:14 Not we make a carrier each
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:03:41 But eventually we might have the ability to do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:03:43 In PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 23:46:13 I'll only block if it constantly comes onto my plot and it disrupts me building
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:06:57 THEY'RE BOOBS LMAO. WHY SHOULD HE GET WARNED FOR SOMETHING ALL GIRLS HAVE
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:07:06 that's like roblox censoring the "shader" t-shirts
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:07:21 And it's not like they're EXPOSED.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:07:24 they were covered!
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:07:59 I'm gonna actually be mad if that warn isnt removed or something, cause it's literally bullshit to warn him
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:08:09 when it's not NSFW, just slightly suggestive
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:09:29 he didnt make NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:09:36 I can DM you the picture of his build
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:09:41 it was suggestive but not NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:09:44 had a bra on
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:09:50 no NSFW showing at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:11:00 Orange. It wasnt fucking NSFW man.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:11:06 Plus EVERY WOMAN HAS THEM.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:11:35 ^ real questions
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:16 HOW ARE BREASTS SEXUAL CONTENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN COVERED
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:23 OH MY LORD THE LOGIC IS SO FLAWED
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:39 Okay does anyone have proof of it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:43 Do you have a picture of it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:53 Show it.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:12:54 DM it
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:13:27 He does have a point. I mean he's on the line in that case.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:13:35 As of right now, he's on the line
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:13:49 It CAN be considered NSFW, but at the same time, there is no... N. showing.
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:13:56 So it's not NSFW, technically
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:14:24 I would give him 2 warnings or something. Cause both sides can argue their opinions
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:14:30 but at the end of the day neither side is right nor wrong
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:14:42 As technicalities are a BITCH
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:02 Jwar, just make it one of those japanese swimsuits
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:16 Jwar, they're complaining cause you pretty much showed N
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:29 Just make it into a swimsuit
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:35 as in
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:45 JAPANESE SWIMSUIT, those wierd fullbody ones
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:15:54 Then they cant complain
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:16:06 Jwar, just listen to me mate
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:16:22 make it less revealing and it's A-OK
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:16:43 See, both sides came to an agreement
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:16:51 SEE WHEN YOU USE LOGIC
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:16:58 and have patience, instead of BAN BAN BAN
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:18:06 I actually see a woman in that

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:16:55 it's a better choice than any to me atleast.
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:17:21 Jail told me to submit a report to Discord
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:17:25 so I'm doing that now
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:29:28 I am back now
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:29:35 I reported that guy to discord with proof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:34:34 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:34:35 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:34:35 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:34:46 Wheels + Pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:34:49 best train combo
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:35:10 it cant go up hills tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:35:18 that's one thing I should try to work on
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:45:52 I perfected it!
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:46:01 My train car works really well so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:54:10 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:54:17 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:54:34 wanna see my dual-screen setup
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:55:20 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:55:30 that picture fyi
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:55:35 is two separate screens
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:55:46 the train?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:55:50 cause it works way better
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:56:04 It legit works hella better than any other attempt I've done with cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:56:21 Well my design is working!
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:56:33 and it even has it's own safety
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:56:43 with having the  wheels pushed with pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:56:59 If I'm going fast, and I want to try and reduce the chances of me going off the rail
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:57:07 I can retract the pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:57:15 which makes the car wobble in the rails
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:57:23 which has helped me stay on the rails
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:57:27 and helped me on hills
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:58:20 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:58:26 If I have the pistons extended
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:58:34 the train will detail, the wheels will push up
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:58:40 when i go around the turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:58:44 and ill derail
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:59:02 pulling the pistons back, and going wobble mode, means when i go around the turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:59:10 all the weight of the train is pushing down, keeping it on the rail
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:59:18 instead of being strained between the two rails
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 08:06:26 battleship
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 08:06:30 want to go on the VIP so i can show you
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 08:08:35 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 07:31:36 @          madattak
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 07:31:53 You know what would suck
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 07:32:01 If discord made it so doing that even
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 07:32:06 Would ping the person still
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:18:47 yeah that's my biggest pet peeve about PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:19:02 we cant place half blocks with other things, like a half piston
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:19:06 most infuriating thing ever
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:45:42 isnt newdude that asshole who threatened to warn me for hitting his build or something
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:47:11 Imagine having the power to use Dyno, to ban someone across all servers with dyno
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:47:24 that would be a literal thanos snap for the person that's getting banned
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:48:10 that would be discord's greatest marketing campaign
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:59:02 Joey cant handle anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 15:59:05 which is why i blocked him
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:00:48 oh yeah deception is in the community server
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:01:29 i can check
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:02:32 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:02:34 everyone in here
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:10:03 As I said
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:10:06 check more thoroughly
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:10:09 if you want to
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:10:45 the thing is, with the shit he caused with me, i dont believe him at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:12 Do you want me to warn him
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:28 Or threaten him with it, if he doesnt tell who sent him the link
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:38 well if someone in here has the links
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:41 that means they can dm him
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:29:34 if the server is full, it could be shut down and have the link reset
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:29:47 just make sure if we do reset the link, give it to rick first
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:29:49 so he joins

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:33:33 not from the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:33:35 but from the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:33:59 Well he's banned from PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:03 and he's still using the link
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:12 I bet you the kid searched his history
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:16 just to get the server link
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:38 shut down the servers and reset the link
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:42 then pop it in <#501059272675688468>
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:34:54 imperial i doubt that
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:35:08 Cause if I go to my bookmarks and click PC VIP #1

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:37:48 Deception left around the time that Imperial pinged Rick
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:37:59 so It makes me suspect someone in here IS going to Deception
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:38:09 but i cant be sure
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:38:28 cause last thing he said to me was the simply put,

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:44:48 *Counting with Plane crazy. We can only count up to 24*
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:49:53 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:17:01 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:19:04 Should I delete my two airships?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:19:24 I used them both to get the ranks I have, so should I free space?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:19:28 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:19:56 Well both builds were produced to get ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:20:11 they both cant even fly properly, the top one did fly well for a while, but the update fucked it up
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:20:41 Cause i mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:20:49 if i free up space, my next project is a bomber probably
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:20:51 and a ship
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:21:26 I'll also probably drop my YG-262
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:21:33 Which had a semi-working ejection system
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:22:29 alright.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:22:42 Good night airships. You will forever be remembered.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:23:34 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:23:36 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:23:38

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:24:23 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:24:24 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:25:02 The only large build I have left
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:25:04 is my carrier.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:26:58 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:27:24 the music I'm listening to makes everything so much more emotional
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:28:11 ill dump the playlist im listening to in <#497142796961054721>
general 2019-01-06 23:28:16 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFEFD0E18112A73C7
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:14:20 !rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:15:02 damn, to think I have 11 ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:15:26 ** *"persimmon"* **
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:29:47 im sitting here in my little car speeding and flying around
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:30:14 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:59:30 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:59:34 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 05:44:55 I really hope the skis get the ability to steer creations
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 05:45:06 I have a creation that will make good use of that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:06 I don’t understand why people would make swastikas in a game
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:23 Maybe if you’re going for historical accuracy on a build, I’d understand it and be okay with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:34 But just to make one. I don’t get it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:27:24 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:27:25 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:28:15 Just have Rick ban him
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:30:02 We have his tag and his name
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:30:16 And his  ID
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:30:18 197787044896833536
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:30:52 Developer mode is a bitch to people who get reported
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:05 Cause I can find the server ID, message ID’s, user’s ID.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:08 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:27 Time to send that to rick
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:38 Wait, do you know if PC uses Kohl’s admin?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:32:30 But he would only have him and rick... or whoever is an owner
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:32:34 Cause I mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:32:41 If PC did have Kohl’s
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:33:00 Rick could drop a small update and in that update, add a permban in the Kohl’s scripts
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:33:28 I love Kohl’s admin for the fact that I can ban people from the scripts
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:16:23 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:16:28 Was swastika man ever taken out
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:16:30 @ Jameson
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:17:11 really?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:17:17 perm from the game?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:17:37 aw
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:19 that's not satisfying
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:28 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:34 As I said to Jameson earlier,
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:48 If the guy was making the swastika to have more accuracy in a build
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:53 I'd be okay with it.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:18:59 As, it's historical accuracy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:19:08 but to make one and then fly it around
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:19:12 nah
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:19:58 Just reset the community VIP links
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:20:07 and if he gets in again, perm ban him from Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:43:50 I'm 17
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:43:52 <:dab:520022237705928704>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:05:11 ** *Romeo Foxtrot, Shall We Dance* **
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:10:33 lol Jameson was the only mod to deal with ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:10:40 until he dropped out, then VIP did it I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:10:41 once
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:11:15 who is roborail
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:11:22 is he staff?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:11:40 oh, well i straight up blocked and blacklisted him
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:11:45 cause he was being a lying dick
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:12:43 I blocked him for the fact that I was chilling out testing my prop only plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:12:55 and he decided to ram me with his blue/white jetliner
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:00 so I call him out, and HE LIES
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:03 LIES TO MY FACE
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:05 "I was just flying"
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:07 BULLSHIT.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:14 So I blocked his ass and blacklisted him
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:29 and Jameson told me to leave people alone cause people are complaining about me
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:13:38 when it was probably robo being a crybaby and going to Jameson
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:11 No, I'm kinda opinionated, and I find alot of people to be retards
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:14 and if I spot an issue
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:18 I'll point it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:27 if you're the issue, and you deny it, I'll point it out more
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:40 I'm not toxic though
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:14:53 I can get pissed, but i dont really go to the lines of toxic ranting
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:16:37 that's why he's imperialmistakes
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:16:46 he was imperialscum, but now he made an imperialmistake
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:17:04 hahahaha bad puns and play on words
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:19:58 oh yes thank you for speaking
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:20:02 now he is blocked on discord too
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:21:17 <@!168154760866693120>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:21:31 scoober rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:28:29 resizing tools would mean way more work for the staff
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:28:45 as creations instead of being made with 1,500 blocks, could be made with 800
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:28:52 So the entire idea of ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:28:55 would have to be redone
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:29:42 wtf does TLDR mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:55:22 im making a bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:55:37 gonna have a bombay and wing-mounted bombs

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:34:33 I like how I can spawn the tip jar in the game RN
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:34:40 without any form of gamepass
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:37:43 what are these massive conveyors for
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:38:08 I could test my troll car
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:58:26 That_cat_in_blue with the 12 year old insults
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:59:35 I can tell a difference from 30 and 60
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:59:43 30 is more choppy than 60, and 60 is very smooth
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:55:30 Oh hey a wild Madattack
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:56:13 
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:56:24 What

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 00:20:38 Not engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 00:21:33 I would love to have actual missiles and rockets in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 23:23:48 Is that “Eclipse”?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 23:23:57 Can I go insult the fuck out of him?

plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:47:48 I see that Interstellar ranger ship
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:47:52 Or whatever it’s called
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:49:37 Interstellar is my favorite movie besides Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:50:45 Hans Zimmer is a Master at music and orchestra
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:51:09 Space Oddity? Isn’t that by uh
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:51:13 David B-
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:51:14 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:51:33 That’s why I named my fat shit bomber “Major Tom”
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:51:49 I deleted it recently cause it’s laggy and useless.
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:52:27 No seaplanes?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:52:47 Someone suggested seaplane to me, when I asked what to build
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:52:55 So I’ve been suggesting seaplane to everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:53:23 Should build the scene of the crop fire
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:54:13 *No time for caution begins to play*
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:55:03 Lol, NTFC is my favorite dog from the movi
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:55:06 Movie
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:55:13 With First Step following right behind it
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:55:17 And Detach
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:55:36 Murphy reminds me of First step
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:57:12 People can criticize it
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:57:15 But it was amazing
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:00:14 BV-238
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:06:54 fucking hate seeing spanish speakers in ROBLOX
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:28:42 I'm on the 2nd community VIP, if you join and begin lagging it I'm straight up reporting you.
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:32:14 go to <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:32:19 jesus fuck, stop spamming it here
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:33:32 are you fucking kidding me
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:39:26 the only other rank im going for
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:39:28 is inventor
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:40:45 you know what i love about PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:40:51 you can get a ton of ranks, off a single build
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:40:58 if you're dedicated enough
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:41:50 I got... Mega carrier, floating fortress, commander, master builder, all from my carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:42:10 then I got then I got master engineer and master technician from my steampunk airship
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:42:43 also dont mind the repetition
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:42:48 my PC is being a shit bag
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:50:09 
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:50:14 Making a bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:50:43 The engines will be designed differently too
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:52:04 I have an idea. this bomber build is going to be based on an ** *"Alternate Universe"* **
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:52:24 Where during WW2, the Germans were more advanced, and as they pushed further, their tech advanced
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:52:50 so This will most likely have some form of swas on it. Maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:52:55 Unless it doesnt fit anywhere
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:53:01 then I'll just color it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:53:57 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:54:09 I think I've started something
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:54:39 I think because of my continuous suggestion of "seaplane"
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:54:47 now battleship says it when somebody asks
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:55:06 lmao the same thing happens at school
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:55:22 I normally leave before the bell rings, at lunch, so other people when I stand up, they begin to stand up.
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:57:17 seaplane
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:57:36 no ^
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:57:59 no

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:59:15 I have the BV in war thunder
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:59:23 its a fortress in the sky
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:00:19 google it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:00:55 So swasti’s aren’t allowed at all now?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:01:06 That’s kinda bullshit, especially for historically accurate builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:01:31 The iron cross means something entirely different
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:01:38 ^
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:01:40 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:01:55 Can Plane Crazy PLEASE not be like Activision
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:02:02 And not be afraid of historical accuracy
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:02:32 Okay but that’s because people make flying swasti’s
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:02:41 And use it to be offensive
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:03:12 In a VIP server we should be allowed to make builds with Swasti’s
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:03:18 As long as
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:03:27 They are historically accurate AND NOT just to have one
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:03:56 So a Ju-87 Stuka or Fw-200 Condor with the swasti on its tail be allowed
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:04:14 I don’t see why we can’t do it in vip servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:04:21 Plus anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:04:39 I could make the same swasti flag, but with the iron cross
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:04:43 And still get moderated
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:05:30 Also it’s stupid to moderate PFP’s that have to do with imperial japan or communism
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:05:56 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:06:15 For starters can you stop fucking over-exaggerating
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:06:24 “Freely build swasti’s”
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:06:36 In a VIP server that only people here or friends of said player have access to
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:06:47 And not use it in public lobbies
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:07:20 You guys don’t even enforce the rules on people that make flying swastis as it is! Unless rick is ACTIVELY online and watching chat
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:07:24 Those people are never caught
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:07:37 So why punish the people that have been respectful to the lies
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:07:46 Rules*
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:08:08 Everyone in this discord that hasn’t been banned for breaking the rules
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:08:10 Follows them
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:08:40 Well that’s not my fault or the staff’s fault! Or mad’s fault
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:08:54 Well that’s great
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:09:10 But I still find the idea of completely restricting swasti’s to be absolutely stupid
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:09:31 I’ve never seen one swasti
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:09:34 While I played
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:09:57 No no
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:10:02 I mean PUBLIC servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:10:08 Not once
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:10:15 And I doubt rick has time to ban them all
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:10:51 Plus I mean think of it this way
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:06 My old test for a bomber had swasti’s on it. Cause the engines had engines on em
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:11 Rockets***
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:18 For more power
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:28 The blades had rocket engines on the end
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:30 To provide power
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:36 And it looked like a swasti
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:13:02 Since xpert is trying to stop the conversation, I’ll end with this. It’s a stupid ass idea to completely restrict t when only the trolls do it. And that’s it. I was planning to possibly make one on my bomber, since it was going to be an AU WW2 based bomber. But that was still up in the air.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:13:30 *Okay i wanna reply to what super said really badly*
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:14:04 Roger id have an 100+ page speech
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:14:05 For Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:14:36 Anyway, I will reply to super
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:14:46 Cause he brings up an invalid point
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:16:38 We can’t do anything to Roblox unless you go to their HQ and demand to speak to them otherwise you’ll take down their entire website and make sure they can’t put it back up.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:16:47 Cause then they lose  money
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:17:07 And Roblox. Free but pay to look decent!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:18:28 Oh boy here we go.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:21:28 I read the rules and I have my opinions.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:52:39 Alex, you’d be an idiot to try to stop it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:52:48 It was added into the game, so people can do it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:52:58 You’re the kinda person to whine over someone using an Auto in CSGO
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:53:03 “Oh it takes no skill”
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:53:06 It’s in the game.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:53:13 And it takes more skill to do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:53:51 To make something fly then put a shit ton of tnt on the front
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:54:08 And be able to SUCCESSFULLY ram something
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:54:11 Hella skill
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:54:20 And it’s not a bad use of skill
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:55:10 Not trashy moves
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:55:13 It’s skill.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:55:15 Simply put
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:55:22 There’s no good or bad about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:57:35 Okay but find a way to prevent it then
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:57:46 Blacklist, extra armor
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:57:50 I mean really!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:04 ^
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:07 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:15 Exactly why Alex’s logic doesn’t work
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:29 Don’t want to get blown up? Don’t even go into PVP
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:35 Or
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:58:38 Find a new server
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:59:01 TNT is the best addition to PC. It’s opened up so many new doors for creations.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:59:07 And it’s going to open many more doors
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:59:58 We’re going to see rocket trucks, actual missiles, a lot of suggestions will go around the idea of tnt
general 2019-01-14 06:02:28 
general 2019-01-14 06:02:37 
general 2019-01-14 06:02:38 Got rid of the BRZ btw
general 2019-01-14 08:33:04 Cause a lot of people love the car and it’s still huge in Japan
general 2019-01-14 08:33:38 Also don’t tag me for petty shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 19:38:41 I won’t be logging on PC for a little
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 19:38:50 I’ve been too caught up with NFS on my PS4
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 19:56:54 <:okbuddy:518518403686989856>
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:20:37 Lol this NooBaris Guy seems like the kinda guy to get banned then whine and bitch about it like he was done wrong.
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:46:55 Don’t fucking tag me
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:46:58 Jesus fuck
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:47:10 This guy has been tagging a bunch of people
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:47:13 Just mute his ass
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:07:26 Damnit. I bookmarked the links so then I could access them easier and now they were changed ;~;
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:08:56 What if
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:09:10 We have a google form, for entry into the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:09:18 People HAVE to use email
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:09:24 And you’ll have a list of all the people
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:09:35 So then you know if it was leaked, someone in that list leaked
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:09:51 Well it’ll shorten the numbers down greatly
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:11:12 Well now the spy knows that
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:11:15 Omega oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:12:02 Just, have a list of people that staff approves can join the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:12:17 Every staff member will have to agree on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:06:00 Oh, when was vip opened?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:16:39 Thot catcher? You can’t catch me >:D
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:18:02 Oh god
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:18:04 RTGame

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:18:33 I’m getting the meteors
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:18:40 Your day is today
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:37:58 The A-10 is amazing and all
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:38:10 But the F-35 is a better jet in terms of advancements
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:38:24 The F-35 is meant to be able to “disappear” from plain sight
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:38:38 And still be able to take a target out from like... 100 Miles away
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:41:47 mysean tell Mad that
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:41:55 It’s up to Mad to give the server mods game mods
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:42:43 Because it’s hard to pickup sarcasm from **text.**
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:43:04 Now I’m just going to block you for being a wise ass
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:43:28 I’m already pissed off
general 2019-01-18 23:46:13 The A-10 is CAS done right
general 2019-01-18 23:46:22 That’s why our shitty heads of the military can’t get rid of it
general 2019-01-18 23:46:35 We don’t have any better plane for the role the A-10 does
general 2019-01-18 23:46:42 Name one plane that can do the role of CAS
general 2019-01-18 23:46:58 And do the role JUST AS GOOD
general 2019-01-18 23:47:21 Pretty bird doesn’t matter

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:06:47 and thought he was high or something
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:06:50 I was so confused
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:06:55 until I saw "boymahina"
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:07:01 then I realized
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 02:55:31 **Gibe idea**
general 2019-02-13 03:13:39 **I saw someone get banned in UD today**
general 2019-02-13 03:13:48 I was aiming towards Odessa cause that's where he got banned
general 2019-02-13 03:14:01 The guy threatened to DDoS people in the server
general 2019-02-13 03:15:48 lmao oof
general 2019-02-13 03:16:12 I know a UD mod, he's in a discord based on a UDU RP group

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:11:20 I put a macro on my mouse that does 50 c/s
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:11:27 and it's useful for building long lines of wedges
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:21:01 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:21:01 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:22:14 We need longer glass triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:05 not 10
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:08 I'd say 7
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:20 maybe categorize it by length
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:31 so 1x1 Blocks, 1x2 blocks, 1x3 blocks, etc

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 21:23:09 that reminds me of a build I made in Blocksworld, years back
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 21:23:39 we need 1x1-1x7 of all blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 21:23:57 including glass
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 21:24:57 lmao

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:49:38 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:49:57 it's a seaplane, and I wanted force on the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:05 okay I need to either lower the CoL or something
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:10 cause she's HELLA nose heavy
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:19 my plane is really nose heavy

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:37 oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:39 good idea
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:44 or ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:45 good idea
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:58 I just need more power
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:52:09 like, I want this to fly level
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:23:29 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:23:30 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:24:09 Over 1,000 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:48:15 
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:48:17 
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:48:19 
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:48:21 
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:48:34 380 at level flight, and it takes off hella fast
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:50:05 I did it because it actually looks really cool
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:50:10 Imagine that same cockpit, but in space
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:50:22 plus it would help the pilot see better
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:51:31 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:52:03 this thing has propellers
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:52:08 it's a atmosphere plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:52:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:52:22 imagine that same cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:52:25 but on a spacecraft
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:54:13 okay dude
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:54:17 im not making a space plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:54:32 and that doesnt look as cool
general 2019-02-14 21:11:56 I like that anime chest PFP that guy has.
general 2019-02-14 21:12:05 I have a better one tho
general 2019-02-14 21:12:12 Erwin Rommel saying “Perfect.”
general 2019-02-14 21:12:16 Nothing is more perfect.
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:12:44 Once I get on my PC
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:12:51 I’m gonna finish up my seaplane
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:13:03 Hopefully I can maybe add more engines to let it take off from the water
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:13:12 Or do something to let it take off from the water
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:13:31 Question. Is there any way I could add something to let it take off as is?
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:20 Like add a sled or some shit.
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:24 Well my plane can float
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:30 And it floats damn well
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:38 I might add more helium to the pontoon
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:47 Each pontoon has 3 helium beams inside
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:54 Idk if it helped at all
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:15:39 Well I mean. My plane is somewhat balanced
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:16:16 Add weight to the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:17:15 I have so many super rockets on my thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:19:26 4 in the outer engines =8
1 in the back of the inner engines =2
3 in each pontoon =6
2 on each pontoon =4
3 on each side of the hull =6
1 on the tail
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:19:39 I have 20+ super engines. On my seaplane
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:19:56 Make a huge seaplane
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:20:01 That can takeoff and land on the water
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:20:11 And has pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:20:17 BV-238 huge
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 22:38:38 is there a community VIP 1
general 2019-02-15 03:43:48 Lol has anyone here played Attrition?
general 2019-02-15 03:43:55 Has a picture of a tiger as the thumbnail
general 2019-02-15 03:44:56 I pretty much in that game, went on a helicopter rampage
general 2019-02-15 03:45:09 I was killing people left and red, spawnkilling them as they tried to get to cover
general 2019-02-15 03:45:25 If they took C, I was on their ass like a Sidewinder on a MiG-21
general 2019-02-15 03:45:52 After spawning like 5 helis in total, and having died in all but the last one
general 2019-02-15 03:46:01 I DC’ed out of nowhere. Wasn’t mad tbh
general 2019-02-15 03:46:12 I was surprised but laughing
general 2019-02-15 03:46:26 The game didn’t seem to want me to do any more damage to these poor guys lmao
general 2019-02-15 03:46:35 I MAYBE feel bad. MAYBE BARELY
general 2019-02-15 03:49:15 If the game had a kill counter
general 2019-02-15 03:49:18 It would be above 50
general 2019-02-15 03:49:22 Just from using the heli
general 2019-02-15 03:49:28 And there was like 15 people
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 13:01:25 My only issue with the game is that we need more sizes for every block
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 13:01:45 1x1 blocks, 1x2, 1x3
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 13:02:01 Only extend in length, don’t increase width
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 23:36:53 time to play some playne crazy

https://youtu.be/ytc4j3DRwAo
general 2019-02-19 22:04:23 This video is so old. Yet it's still as emotional as it was the first time I watched it.
general 2019-02-19 22:07:53 You should
general 2019-02-19 22:08:13 It's almost impossible for me to watch it with a straight face
general 2019-02-19 22:08:42 It brings alot of joy and also sadness to see this video buried some 4,900 videos into my liked list
general 2019-02-19 22:09:52 It's not boring if you actually cared about the game, or the fact that one could interpret it as your grandparents will die off some day.
general 2019-02-19 22:10:14 It makes it x100 more sad to think of my grandparents when watching this.
general 2019-02-19 22:12:57 GMod was boring because you probably never had people to play with
general 2019-02-19 22:13:07 I played Garry's Mod since 2015-2016
general 2019-02-19 22:16:46 Well. You don't have very creative friends.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:14:46 ^
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:14:51 Exactly what I was about to say
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:15:22 the man didn't innovate anything he just made something that existed already <:fingergun:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:15:31 ooo ^
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:15:33 I like that idea

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:10:21 With my massive parachute bomber
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:10:32 I think I crashed it.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:10:38 It was my first time using it in combat
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:11:07 My plane is only 1,076

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:09:38 Some douchebag names Toasii was in my game and he was like “Don’t copy this yacht if you ever make one” then goes “Because I have a whole team of people that will ruin your day”
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:09:44 Like how much of a cunt do you have to be.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:10:08 **PIECE OF SHIT ALERT**
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:10:27 I legit said like a minute before his whole team of people crap
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:10:36 That I wouldn’t even bother copying his yacht
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:10:46 I wouldn’t be able to do it. Too detailed for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:14:36 No, I legit said I couldn’t copy it
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:14:40 Then he says that
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:15:12 He said “don’t copy this yacht if you ever make one”
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:15:19 I said,
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:15:22 “Trust me”
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:15:26 “I’d never be able to”
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:16:15 I said the stuff I said
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:16:22 After he said don’t copy his yacht
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:16:29 I said the trust me crap after he said that
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:16:35 I responded to him saying not to copy it
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:16:40 With I would never be able to
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:17:06 I was chill with him until he said that crap

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:20:46 And someone else says “If I had a nuke that would crash the game”
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 06:20:52 “I would drop it on you Yoko”

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:14:41 this was earlier
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:14:49 some nugget
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:14:54 had a creation with KYS on the side
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:32:53 Looks a lot like a Su-35 Flanker
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:33:10 Is it flanker? Idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:33:37 Honestly it looks like all these different Sukhoi SU jets
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:34:17 Ah, looks close to a Su-57
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:34:39 
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:34:46 Looks 90% close to that
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:35:01 I think blacklisting might be broken
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:35:07 Either that or it’s glitchy
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 07:37:58 I’m planning on making a massive rocket

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 19:39:51 if I did just bombs, without parachutes
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 19:39:56 i could store 5x36
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 19:40:09 and if i did it where it was just one level, the disconnects attached to the sides of the bombs
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 19:40:28 8x36

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:22:49 I've been seeing alot of *honey* ads
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:22:53 done by MrBeast
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:49:45 MiG's do look alot like Sabre's
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:50:09 they do...
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:50:30 take two silver, unmarked models of both
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:50:33 and put them side by side
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:50:41 I'd say they were from the same country
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:50:59 You're just blind
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:11 Like the whole ordeal with Silvia's and Skyline's
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:29 Flame
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:33 if you were a DUMMY
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:37 **D U M M Y**
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:42 fucking idgit.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:52 If you didnt know what either plane were
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:04 I spelt idgit, not idiot.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:07 idiot.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:33 and here we see Grammar National Socialists.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:46 Droppin them hot blocks on these nerds
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:52 cause they're being ducks.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:53:02 *intentionally said duck*
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:53:24 vip if you didnt know a SINGLE THING about jets
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:53:43 and you saw a completely silver, unmarked plane, the Sabre and Mig-15
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:53:51 would you think they were the same, or near close.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:12 Think of a Silvia S13 and a Skyline R32
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:19 I know they're different, but
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:23 if i didnt know anything about cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:30 id say they were the same besides a few differences!
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:55:17 hello Point Man
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:55:37 I was trying to make a *Point* to IdiotV1, I mean FlameV1
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:56:01 that if you were an idiot, you would probably see the S13 and the R32 to be the same, the same idea with the F-86 and MiG-15
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:56:27 Flame keeps saying stupid shit like "nOt ReAlLy"
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:56:42 but he doesnt understand the concept of looking at it as if you didnt know what they were at all
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:57:08 Failato
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:57:34 **^^**
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:57:39 Exactly whitewater

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:59:05 **FlameV1Today at 3:58 PM
@iiUnderPowered these guys think the F-86 looks just like the MiG-15
actually hilarious**
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:59:14 Legit cancer.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:59:48 Guys, it's as simple as this
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:59:56 Flame doesnt understand how to look at things simply.
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:00:19 He literally went off on a tangent like "oh these guys think these planes are the same"
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:00:31 like bruh we said to look at it as if you didnt know what they were
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:00:35 like you fuckin dumb or what?

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:02:39 good interaction with the guy
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:02:44 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:02:58 well that's hard to do
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:03:07 I'll say something like the Tu-160 and B-1B look alike
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:03:13 AND HERE HE COMES
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:03:23 "no it doesnt it doesnt look similar you're dumb lol omg huhuh"

plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:10:47 im making a souped up personal quadcopter
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:10:50 with parachutes and shit
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:29:53 so
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:29:55 I just found out
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:30:04 the 1x3 idea i had
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:30:08 for the parachute cluster bomber
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:30:10 wont work
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:30:14 im gonna have to go 1x2
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:30:35 cause disconnecters cant connect to the top of parachute
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:34:48 my entire wifi is lagging
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 03:34:52 discord, twitter, everything
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:49:36 Blacklisting should also blacklist someone being able to shoot st you and damage you
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:50:01 Cause if you blacklist some asshat who’s camping, and he can still shoot you, there’s no point
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:50:28 Unless this is already in the game
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 04:59:19 I feel like I should abandon my cluster parachute bomb thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 04:59:27 it's at 534 blocks, it cant hover
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 04:59:36 and the bombs explode before they can hit the ground
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:00:03 I mean I could always set them to detonate when i push a button
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:00:10 since numpad 1 opens the chute and drops them
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:00:20 I just need a better way to make it hover
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:00:28 also that's what I wanted to work on. missile truck
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:01:07 I did
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:01:11 ima make some weird missile base thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:08:42 are you the idiot with the ugly ass noob mech next to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:09:29 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:10:08 Uglier than this?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:11:20 he does have knees
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:17:40 what better to listen to, while building a rocket thingy
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 05:17:53 than **H A R D B A S S**
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:05:18 I’m in a GTA V crew and there was a meetup today, so I decided to join
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:05:28 And the others lined up, 4 of us in total
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:05:42 So I did too, and had my gun out, since they did
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:05:52 And one of them took pictures
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:05:56 And posted them
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:06:04 If you look at my PFP
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:06:15 I was the one doofus who was ready to slaughter shit,
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:06:22 
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:06:24 Look at me on the right
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:06:53 Fucking, ready to go crazy and spray
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:12:43 Oh yeah and not long after the meetup finished the asshat with the black and red hair banned me from the crew cause I killed them using the little ray gun thing.
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:13:12 Which was an accident. I didn’t think it would kill them, I had flung myself around many times before these pictures
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:13:26 Oh well. I’ll be back in it tomorrow I bet.
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:13:30 Still a funny picture
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:00:11 Damn this man got a point
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:00:21 I could put “feminist tears” on my shit and get banned
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:00:28 Cause it could be offensive
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:00:39 **LOL.**
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:00:52 So did Russia
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:01:02 Tru
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:01:19 If I make a bomb and out a radioactive symbol on it, is it offensive
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:01:29 Since I could be referencing Hiro
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:01:47 What if I made a Mercedes Benz and out the logo next to it
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:03 Would it be offensive? Since some people think importing cars is offensive
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:20 WE’RE LEGIT MAKING THE RULE SOUND OVERLY STUPID
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:23 Like article 13
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:37 If Twitch is copyrighted, and I use twitch and don’t pay, will I get banned
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:43 <:What:559529350261637139>
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:50 SEE
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:02:58 You get what I’m seeing here. So many loopholes
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:03:17 I live in the USA
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:03:42 So If i sing something or use a song and I’m not making money off of it, I can’t get copyright strikes
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:03:45 Cause of free use
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:04:21 As long as I’m not gaining money off of the song or anything, my video is safe. That’s what people don’t understand about Article 13
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:04:30 Article 13 can’t fuck with the USA
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:04:34 Cause we have free use
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:06:20 The EU is already a meme
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:06:32 That’s the funny thing about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:07:08 European politicians don’t realize they’re a meme, and they don’t own the EU.
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 19:07:14 So they’d have to end themselves
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:43:10 I got a parachute carpet bomber
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 00:37:29 on the dev server, there's fuel tank beams right
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 00:37:35 I've used **5 5 0**
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 00:37:42 in one build
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 00:37:46 let's see how much fuel that is
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 00:37:58 **247,500**
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 02:49:48 that is so weird
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 02:49:55 web.roblox proves underage
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 02:50:00 and roblox.com proves overage
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 02:50:13 cause if i post PC's link

plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:28:33 with detail
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:28:41 and it's my largest build of all
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 18:45:37 What
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:45:10 *airjetsuit sounds like a serial killer in the making.*
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:45:27 *Definitely a serial killer in the making*
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:48:48 *”I am very fuck angry”*
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:49:59 Lol
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:30:34 Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:30:38 I found a really bad bug
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:31:06 
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:31:07 
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:31:19 Basically I spawned in someone elses plot, and he doesnt have a plot, but his plot is my plot
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:31:30 and this "Justin" guy doesnt exist in the server, but has a plot still
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:31:57 idk what's going on, this is in a public server.
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:34:54 right, but explain how my plot was inside his
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:37:40 I know that
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:37:53 no.
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:37:56 He's there
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:38:10 *"EndPlays_Roblox"* is the guy that was in that plot
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:38:13 and he's STILL THERE
bug-reports 2019-08-23 08:38:15 as im there
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:16:56 Idk what to make
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:39:09 I’m making a Rube Goldberg kinda thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:39:16 But the balls go through a course and come back
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:40:52 I wonder if anyone has ever made a mechanism that controls everything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:40:57 Like a drive shaft
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:42:53 Cause I mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:43:02 Youdprobsbly have to make gears
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:03:56 Does anyone know a better way to make individual wheel suspension for tanks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:04:14 I use a single suspension, but I feel like there's a better way
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:07:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:30 Well, just in general better suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:44 Cause right now I have suspension for each wheel, a single suspension-block
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:53 and it connects to the chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:10:31 the thing is im making tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:10:34 working tracks with this too
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:28 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:30 This is my current idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:34 Add more suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:26:42 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:08 It's the HTTC V5.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:28 HTTC is "Hercules Tank Tread Concept"
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:41 Basically I'm trying to make the largest and smallest possible tank treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:44 that are possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:58 HTTC V1 is my first rope treads design, with 5 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:12 V2 is motor treads, 5-wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:21 V3 is 3 wheels, V4 is 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:26 and V5 is going to be 7 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:34:09 that opening would be perfect for like, a tiny plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:16 it's pretty much a plate
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:20 with hinges on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:26 that's what it looks like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:36 google mk 5 tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:38 and look at the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:01:35 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:01:37 I made a magnet powered plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:07:21 almost tempted to go for "Crazy Engineer"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:07:26 with the magnet engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:00 it doesnt say i cant use magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:18 *"Build a 600 block plane powered by a single propeller engine (any size) without helium capable of going 400sps in level flight."*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:29 doesnt say i cant use magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:49 Magnet planes is my new engine for fighters
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:32 This is mine.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:33 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:46 158 parts
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:56 just 5 magnets at the back
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:28 I'm gonna make this thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:30 uberpowered
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:33 im adding more magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:03 15 now
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:33 1,700 sps level
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:39 but unable to manuever
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:59 im gonna make a magnet MISSILE
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:12:13 goes straight uo
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:12:15 up
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:19 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:21 My new PVP jet
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:25 or, technically not jet
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:31 since its not powered by a jet engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:22 I join a server and see this guy making tank treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:27 so i go over to see what his concept is
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:37 and he blacklists and copy-blacklists me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:49 then as SOON AS I grab MY tracks out
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:53 He unblacklists me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:05 He's thirsty to take my design lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:27 look at chat too
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:27 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:59 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:30 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:35 this is a fucking
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:38 abomination
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:22 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:25 This is my largest design
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:28 HTTC V5 (7DW)
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:54 oop
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:53:05 I found a ww2-germany copter
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:20 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:23 I mean to be fair it doesnt mean anything anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:25 since rickje isnt on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:20 Yeah, true
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:46 but mine is really stable
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:37 aaaand he left
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:38 perfect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:49 he wants to put his tracks onto a sherman
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:54 and make it "realistic"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:01:26 why do i feel like he's making a tank because he saw it in World of Tanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:01:57 Why the tin can tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:02:08 Why not a Tiger H1 or Churchill Mk VII
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:02:30 Or hell, Centurion Mk5 AVRE
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:02 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:12 I mean from how he made the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:14 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:24 i doubt the chassis will look any better.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:29 the suspension is better than mine,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:36 but those tracks... jesus christ.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:04:02 it would look good if they were 2-long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:04:09 or 3-long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:09 I don't make tanks,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:12 but i make tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:34 im gonna make a shit ton of tracks/treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:06:10 try to come up with a bunch of track-types
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:18 well exploits dont help him
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:21 play the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:27 cause the game uses creativity and skill
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:29 and not exploits
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:39 the MOST damage he could do
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:43 is get the event stuff
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:09:57 im gonna design some new tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:10:27 im gonna take the crappy design the 7 guy had
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:10:30 and make it better
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:19 oooooo
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:24 this is a pretty interesting design tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:59 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:12:04 lemme get a short piece done
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:13:43 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:06 that, is a track design im gonna test
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:39 this is gonna be my widest tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:46 7-wide
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:58 most wide so far was 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:29 this tread design is looking pretty hot
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:44 i have an even better idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:47 friction blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:19:31 well
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:19:41 i do
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:40 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:48 how many wheels should i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:54 3, 5, or 7
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:21:22 standards tracks for me then
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:21:28 except 7-wide
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:25:15 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:25:17 found a huge ass dinosaur
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:30:12 If you can make that
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:30:16 make Cherno Alpha
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:18 it's from Pacific Rim
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:26 the Russian Jaeger
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:29 or however it's spelt
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:09 504 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:13 for a single tread
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:18 holy fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:26 1k blocks for BOTH TREADS
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:30 not including the chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:33 and the suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:49 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:35 come look at my tread
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:52 this thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:54 is going to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:55 nuts
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:37:41 <@!221496030355521536> Do you know a better suspension type for the drive wheels, than mine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:37:50 your name dumb
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:06 road wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:09 thats what i mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:32 I don't know how to make it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:50 Cause my go-to suspension is straight up, just a single suspension on the motors for the wheel
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:53 that connects to chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:10 So basically...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:23 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:32 how would I get that to work in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:57 the most complex thing ive made
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:42:03 was a magnet-powered plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:42:12 i've done folds
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:10 Do remember
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:17 there's 5 wheels per track
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:25 and theyre all drive/road wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:27 theyre all powered
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:47 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:00 So I have a bar connected to a wheel, and the bar is connected to a motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:08 then what, a suspension?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:43 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:05 I don't make like, legit tank tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:21 do the motor and suspension blocks connect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:56 So these both connect to the chassis?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:16 now what about the last wheel? cause it's gonna have pistons on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:51 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:42 if this works, then ill consider using it for my later concept versions
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:46 I'm currently working on 6.1
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:58 6.1 will run for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:52:30 armor and armour
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:54:45 the bar thing isnt working, what am i doing wrong
help 2019-09-24 05:56:47 Trying to make a torsion bar setup for my new tank tread design, but I've never done it before, so idk what's wrong or how to accurately make it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:59:18 i need help with the treads and i already posted in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:59:22 Turbo, help me
help 2019-09-24 05:59:47 where do i put it
help 2019-09-24 06:00:26 but where else
help 2019-09-24 06:00:29 do-...
help 2019-09-24 06:00:33 I've never made this shit before
help 2019-09-24 06:00:44 Can you give me a better explanation
help 2019-09-24 06:00:51 on the edge
help 2019-09-24 06:00:53 does not help
help 2019-09-24 06:00:55 WHICH BAR
help 2019-09-24 06:01:55 are you talking about right here?
help 2019-09-24 06:02:16 or on the chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:04:14 vip gave up trying to help me cause he doesnt know how to fucking explain where to put the god damn suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:45 Vip is this how they connect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:49 cause if not,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:53 i have no fucking clue
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:07:47 so instead of the suspension on the block, put it directly on the motor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:07 oh, so just put it on here...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:09 like this im guessing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:21 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:38 god that took too god damn long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:10:46 wait so put another motor on the top block?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:10:55 or am i misinterpreting it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 this is really fucky
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:12:49 So just to be ENTIRELY SURE, this is how it SHOULD look?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:13:23 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:15:27 so the suspension goes on a separate motor, on the middle?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:15:51 okay, that's not too big of a change
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:17:52 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:13 <@!221496030355521536> Help me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:17 Vip and I are confused
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:24 **H E L P M E**
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:38 You told me to try Torsion bars
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:44 It's your mess
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:48 You have to deal with it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:20:09 It's 1:20 in the fucking morning dude.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:20:38 no point in moving if turbo wont help
help 2019-09-24 06:20:50 
help 2019-09-24 06:20:52 So I'm guessing
help 2019-09-24 06:20:57 both of them connect to the chassis
help 2019-09-24 06:21:06 put a motor on the top block, with the suspension
help 2019-09-24 06:21:14 connect it to the chassis
help 2019-09-24 06:21:24 hm
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:13 I got a good joke
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:16 microwaves
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:23:42 **M M M M M**
help 2019-09-24 06:29:20 
help 2019-09-24 06:29:23 is this supposed to happen
help 2019-09-24 06:30:45 
help 2019-09-24 06:32:18 or you didnt take into account that ALL of these wheels are powered
help 2019-09-24 06:32:27 and are used for movement?

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:05 some dumbasses in my game are saying putting two motors on my suspension would make it better
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:11 but all it did was fuck it up even more
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:34 then one is like "iM a MeChAnIcAl EnGiNeEr"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:08 more like, mentally disabled engineer
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:18 I literally fucking showed the dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:24 what his suspension did
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:33 and all it did was make the tires freak the fuck out
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:00:14 In terms of how annoying the kid fucking is, he's more annoying than 9TheKing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:31 i was told the suspenion was using
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:39 isnt a torsion bar
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:41 but is single wishbone, kinda
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:41 i was told that design
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:43 is "single wishbone"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:51 all that does is fuck it up dude
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:00 that's what "mechanical engineer" dumbass said
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:29 i dont know what types of suspension are there
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:40 like i dont even understand what a wishbone is, in terms of suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:10 mech engineer dumbass said my idea was more like christie suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:34 okay, hol don
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:39 which is the easiest to make in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:46 and works well
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:09 Cause I like suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:15 not for tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:19 that shit is fucked
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:24 the tank suspension is FUCKED
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:39 cause no one knows how to explain the fucking tank suspension to me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:46 vip cant explain it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:48 turbo is a lazy ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:06:03 no, it's cause idk how to make suspension

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:07:37 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:07:40 Would this work as suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:16:53 which one is better? front or back (top or bottom)?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:17:04 front keep the wheels level,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:17:11 but the back make the entire axle more lively

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:48:51 if we had balljoints
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:00 motor2
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:02 makes me want
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:14 to fucking stab myself between the eyes
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:19 when you have it on servo
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:24 it keeps fucking going back and forth
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:14:52 god

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:03 I can make balls go upward, in a tube
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:06 without magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:26 I want to make have balls leave a container, go through a tube
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:30 then return to the top
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:55 how to make a conveyor
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:03 tank tracks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:12 actually, genius idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:20 like the lego GBC things
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:23:12 im finna make a stepper one
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:28:12 im trying to make it fully automatic
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:29:44 https://youtu.be/eRPzL8Uo2Rs
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:29:49 This is pretty much what im gonna make
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:30:45 somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:21 im gonna make a ball thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:28 that transports the ball to the top
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:50 actually thats a good ass idea, make a "great ball run"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:33:07 That, would be a good contest idea.
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:14 there's a 10k PC setup
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:27 a good PC, 3 monitors, included mouse/keyboard, headphones i think even,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:31 and a heavy ass chair

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:20:37 lol

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:25 V0xel
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:31 did you see my idea in <#544722974574379021>
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:37 for a contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:47 I figured out a way to transport the balls up using the stepper idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:51 and to be quite frank
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:55 it's fucking GENIUS
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:28 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:29 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:37 "stairs" for balls
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:05 you know what, i just had an idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:22 What if we had a cross-plot GBC
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:43 that would be dope if you ask me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:50 One person on the end starts it,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:57 then the balls drop into the next person's plot
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:57:00 they continue it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:57:06 and it repeats
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 06:17:39 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:38:35 I finished my ball run
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:38:44 it's a continuous cycle of balls now
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:33 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:37 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:40 ball run complete
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:52 balls get taken to the top by the steppers
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:47:08 then take a short run back to the "pusher"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:49:25 what does one get out of exploiting
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:21 who made it tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:37 as in, the whole ball-stepper thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:44 huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:50 i had a feeling SOMEONE made it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:54 but i wasnt sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:52:14 Did you make it like I did?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:53:31 does mad have to do that
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:53:44 and mad doesnt trust A N Y O N E

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:17:26 please tell me he's being a wise ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:17:54 brick is wondering why ballast tanks dont work on land
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:18:01 and im wondering what car i should make out of my chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:17 my chassis works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:33 maybe pay attention before you make comments?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:40 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:59 it does drift, without an e-brake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:20:03 but thanks for reminding me
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:06 fuck rack and pinion steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:11 how i have it works way better
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:16 and it's not a complex mess
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:48 also my suspension is good
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:50 it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:02 it's not double wishbone or anything, but it still works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:25 I think Expired is trying to get me to make a legit car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:35 I'm not making a legit fucking car with transmission and shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:43 no need
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:20 I said drift car,
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:25 I didnt say realistic drift car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:43 I wanted actual suspension cause it looks and feels better
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:54 and it wont break if i land hard
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:11 fuck off dude
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:29 i know vip
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:54 I want to get better at making suspension, so right now im using the style i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:25:00 and im gonna try to improve it somehow
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:25:29 which tires does the E-brake lock? all?

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:26:37 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:27:28 now im just thinking of a way i can make an e-brake in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:27:44 shove a friction block against the tire, that's my first test
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:31:43 im not sure how to make an E-brake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:22 i mean my car didnt need one, cause it can drift without it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:30 but i thought i'd try
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:40 since Douchecookie kept insisting
general 2019-09-28 02:47:16 Oh you have a stand too?

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:18:54 if you make a box and submerge it, no water would be inside it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:19:04 if you open a hatch, water will pour in

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:19:38 does anyone have any good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:19:50 I'm fresh out of ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:20:03 builds in PC
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:20:34 No
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:21:03 I'd like legit ideas that wouldnt be overly hard to make, but isn't some dumb ass idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:17 eh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:25 im kinda trying to look for more real ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:47 I have Modeler sure, but that's because of an airship I made that, compared to how I am today, is a huge block
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:24:50 more real ideas, real things
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:03 a certain type of tank, a certain type of plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:05 an era of plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:27 a vehicle using a specific kind of propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:48 So a navy ship with ballistic missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:55 ive been wanting to make more navy stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:15 I'm might make
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:17 a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:24 mixed with a destroyer/frigate
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:37 It'll service planes but have missile hatches
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:45 ehhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:50 i have a absolutely fucking shit time
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:55 with any form of VTOL aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:17 I cant make helicopters or anything
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:31 I might try to make some sort of more futuristic carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:36 that's still water-based
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:30:41 i cant make torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:00 i dont know how to make working torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:27 dude that looks like a weenis
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:52 yeah cause they're shit
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:55 terrible velocity
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:00 and do like jack shit
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:11 Hell at least give us AMMO types
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:17 HVAP, APHE, API-T, HEI-T
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:37 HVAP is High Velocity Armor Piercing, perfect for fucking up a jet trying to run away
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:51 Just send a burst into his engine and it's gone
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:09 if Rickje did what Simpleplanes did
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:13 and gave us more weapons
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:16 we'd be good
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:28 Wing guns, hull guns, both of different calibers
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:32 7.62mm to 30mm
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:46 Then have cannons, from 57mm to... 203mm
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:36:07 At the LEAST, would be ammo types with different velocities
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:37:59 The most I ask for, is faster missiles and faster guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:12 and unguided HVAR missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:16 that dip over time
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:50 I want to make a Katyusha
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:54 but i want unguided missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:51:57 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:52:02 If I make a carrier, should i make it taller?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:52:21 right now it would be 15 tall
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:10:32 I’m making a carrier, and it’s gonna be 15 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:10:34 Chonk
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:11:24 I’m gonna have it fold once or twice, vertically
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:12:00 Well actually it’ll be 14 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:43 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:45 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:48 This is gonna end up being a 3-fold carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:58 if i can fit 3 folds
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:10 each "block" is 15 tall,
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:19 but the actual section will be 14
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:33 im at 400 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:38 and this first section isnt even done
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:57:08 it'll be a short mother fucker
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:57:14 but a *W I D E* boi
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:58:08 I'll have enough space then
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:58:59 its around 49 i think
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:00:41 ill do 1 fold then
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:00:43 instead of 2
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:08:27 oh jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:08:28 why
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:36 i mean think of it this way
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:39 if he copies it,
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:42 it might just crash himself
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:43 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:18:57 764 blocks

plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:13:17 WFYB was a genuinely fun game. I liked it. But when you want to make anything advanced it takes to long so fucking do. And it’s irritating
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:13:51 Well I only played the sandbox mode and not often
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:14:30 Plane crazy is also fun, but my motivation to get on and build is so low. I don’t know what to make, and no one ever has good ideas. I find t hard to get motivation to build.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:14:51 Right now my current building game craze is Stormworks. Steam game that has a creative mode to it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:15:21 In Stormworks I have over 60 hours already invested and I got the game December 3rd I think,
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:16 I kinda feel bad for rick
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:30 A decently big game, probably the biggest sandbox game out there on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:40 And he’s the only person working on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:16 Well tbh idk if any other dev would be good. Yeah it seems like rick has a lot but he interacts with the community and puts thing in that interests the community
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:41 I don’t know if having another dev would be good or not
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:56 It would help with getting things fixed or updated
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:00 But in terms of the people.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:27 With how little mad seems to care for PC, if Rick can’t stand working with this dev, he’s stuck with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:39 Then he has less motivation to work on PC because of the other person
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:21:23 Last time mad spoke was September 28th
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:21:31 In <#529858892075761694>

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:45 and NONE OF THEM have said anything.
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:55 So you guys are tryna get me in trouble when you cant even back your shit up
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:58 bug off
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:34:55 the ironic part
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:02 is that if someone built something
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:05 and they like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:13 they should upvote it because they like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:22 but the logic here is if you like a creation you build
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:25 nah you dont like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:42 I can post a shit tank because i want to show people how <:sped:598677949989912722> it is
