plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:06:37 Well, as long as there isnt anything fused to it
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:06:55 You'll need at the very least, a 3x3 area
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:07:19 Wow. You really are making a 16 segment display

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:09:31 Good luck with that m8.
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:11:38 I really wish I could impliment some bits of code into the pistons and motors so that you can combo shift with another key, lets say F, which will activate seperately from one if we pressed just F...

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:40:10 rope treads are a sin
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:40:41 and you can't convince me otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:41:12 *iz gun*
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:58:14 Tank treads that are simple, and more flexible by the more common 1x3 method, but not as flexible as the half-block method.
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:59:50 can't today
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:59:53 sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:59:58 it's smoother than the 1x3
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:00:06 danka
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:00:52 Not any more than rope treads do
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:01:17 That design should be not as laggy as some others
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:01:42 The 1x3 method is less laggy, but really rough
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:01:48 ^^^
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:01:52 Bumpy
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:01:55 Jagged
