The Tale of eoin__ (685998586160218199)
general 2020-05-14 22:09:44 I don't know if this is a common problem, but when a new update happens, does it affect anyone else's builds?
general 2020-05-14 22:11:11 So basically, every update always messes ny planes/jets, and stops them from taking off
general 2020-05-14 22:11:46 It straight up won't lift
general 2020-05-14 22:12:52 I don't really know, when I get it working again, it flies perfectly, but whenever an update occurs it always grounds them.
general 2020-05-14 22:13:19 I usually just replace the control surfaces, helium etc.
general 2020-05-14 22:13:29 Shift the mass around a bit
general 2020-05-14 22:14:20 If so, is there anyway in which I can provent it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 00:52:58 <@557015565374455808>  is hot
general 2020-05-24 03:46:47 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-05-24 03:47:50 Sorry, wrong server mates
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:08:07 But it doesn't censor it in chat, it's only on signs
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:08:24 E, sorry mate
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:08:41 Argue?
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:09:00 Sorry if I came across as hostile
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:09:38 I wasn't
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:10:00 Have I done something?
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:10:17 Is this a joke?
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:11:19 Sorry mate, I just thought it to be weird how you can say it in chat, just not a sign, I'd hate to start a fight.
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:11:43 Sorry for bothering you, I know that now
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:11:57 Luckily, you can spell it out
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:12:20 The only reason I want it on a sign is so people stop calling it Titanic, lol
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:12:41 I even have a wall with facts about it
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:12:56 Lol, do you think I'm over doing it?
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:13:25 Any pics?
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:14:59 Nice!
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:15:07 It looks really stunning mate
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:15:37 Thank you 😄
creations-chat 2020-05-24 17:16:22 Oh no no it's grand, here, brb
general 2020-05-30 21:10:56 Sorry to annoy anyone, but do you know where I can report someone copying my build without consent?
general 2020-05-30 21:11:44 He's taken screenshots
general 2020-05-30 21:12:21 Well that's annoying
general 2020-05-30 21:12:42 It's almost an exact copy
general 2020-05-30 21:13:00 It's quite a small yacht
general 2020-05-30 21:13:02 No folds
general 2020-05-30 21:13:18 But the design's a bit complex
general 2020-05-30 21:14:32 I used anti copy
general 2020-05-30 21:14:38 But he took screenshots
general 2020-05-30 21:15:11 He left the game, but I have his user in screenshots
general 2020-05-30 21:15:18 And the build
general 2020-05-30 21:16:41 Well this is annoying, I could probably rant for another hour or two, so I'll go
general 2020-05-30 21:22:20 
general 2020-05-30 21:22:42 
general 2020-05-30 21:23:20 This kind of thing really just ticks me off
general 2020-05-30 21:24:27 I mean, kids play roblox
general 2020-05-30 21:24:29 That could
general 2020-05-30 21:24:33 You know
general 2020-05-30 21:25:07 He left
general 2020-05-30 21:25:30 Yes?
general 2020-05-30 21:25:37 True
general 2020-05-30 21:26:17 I might redesign my hull, that way no one can say I copied him
general 2020-05-30 21:26:26 I know
general 2020-05-30 21:26:30 But he took screenshots
general 2020-05-30 21:26:34 Before he copied me
general 2020-05-30 21:27:35 I might just buy a v.i.p. now
general 2020-05-30 21:28:07 Oh, that's worth it
general 2020-05-30 21:28:36 Well, I'm convinced I'll buy a V.i.p.
general 2020-05-30 21:29:26 Well my mate;s going mental, so I'm going to go now
general 2020-05-30 21:29:30 mate's*
general 2020-06-02 03:40:01 Mate, what happened here???
general 2020-06-02 03:40:58 <:Bruh:589676002221883403>
general 2020-06-02 03:41:07 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
general 2020-06-13 17:06:22 Okay, so I was just wondering. Are The water propeller 2's broken for anyone else?
general 2020-06-13 17:08:32 That's what happened for me, I take it it's just a bug
general 2020-06-23 21:44:31 Could I ask, is there any specific details I need to mention to report a build?
general 2020-06-23 21:45:06 Oh, okay
general 2020-10-10 16:59:47 Adopt me, ruining roblox since it was made
general 2020-10-10 17:00:25 And you can just tell it's all these 9 year olds
general 2020-10-10 17:19:23 Adopt me, terrorizing Roblox since 2017
general 2020-10-10 17:20:24 I swear to god, If I lost my Never Gonna Give You Up bar, I'll be pissed
general 2020-10-10 17:21:29 <@!304977711988867072> they weren't going to, they were just going to report the discord, for allowing under 13s
general 2020-10-10 17:22:32 I swear to god, If I lost my Never Gonna Give You Up bar, I'll be pissed
general 2020-10-10 17:23:41 Adopt me went from 2m-180 dislike ratio to 2m-484k
general 2020-10-10 17:23:56 Again Adopt me went from 2m-180 dislike ratio to 2m-484k
general 2020-10-10 17:24:54 <@!315262125113081856>
general 2020-10-10 17:25:54 They're not allowing people to join Adopt me
general 2020-10-10 17:28:01 <@!315262125113081856>  h a  w t
general 2020-10-10 17:28:25 Remove the adopt
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:38:24 Motor lock doesn't require that much effort
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:18:20 I'd change that lighter colour, maybe make it a bit more saturated
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:24:31 Bit uncalled for to call his build shit, although I may be missing context  he could of been acting entitled so I don't know, context means everything lol. If I'm wrong I'm really sorry mate
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:27:47 <@621817208313479248> bet it's better than my 2 year old one lol, the windshield hung over the nose lol
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:31:25 Ah, I see, thanks for the formal response, I appreciate that, usually people go on a rant all "you're wrong ah" but ye, I see,  if he can't take feedback and must resort to downvoting people, even people that upvoted him that's really petty, sorry for the misconduct
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:40:25 <@456226577798135808>  just work on it, maybe listen to the criticism, no need to resort to pettiness, I actually upvoted it because there is some potential there, just you know, don't mass downvote people, no need for that. Still think it's got potential, just you know  don't mass downvote people.
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:48:42 <@251880826386513924>  that looks great <:lemonke:783513887382175765>
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:52:05 <@386316144543531009>  mate I used three and that was apparently too many, I just sent three of these monkey pogs<:lemonke:783513887382175765>
creations-chat 2021-01-22 09:34:11 That looks, interesting
creations-chat 2021-01-22 09:37:46 <:lemonke:783513887382175765>
creations-chat 2021-01-22 10:27:21 Old
creations-chat 2021-01-22 10:29:22 Vs new
creations-chat 2021-01-22 10:31:38 Still don't like the prop if I'm being  honest, but it's an easy fix, just seems too large for the Spit
creations-chat 2021-01-22 10:37:17 Ye,
bug-reports 2021-01-31 19:56:34 So I recently made an alt and decided to go for an A-10, I thought I'd use the Sparkler Pot for it's iconic gatling gun, but it's not appearing
bug-reports 2021-01-31 20:05:08 Ye
bug-reports 2021-01-31 20:05:22 But it's not coming up in my inventory
bug-reports 2021-01-31 20:05:31 If you know what I mean
bug-reports 2021-01-31 20:38:21 I've tried that over 2 dozen times
creations-chat 2021-02-01 13:47:07 Lol
creations-chat 2021-02-01 13:49:10 Current progress on my A-10, No gear, no weapons, no paint but would appreciate some criticism
creations-chat 2021-02-01 13:51:42 Roight
creations-chat 2021-02-01 13:56:47 Pic?
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:00:54 That looks really good mate
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:10:58 How's this wing?
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:13:37 Now I need to add some canopy details
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:26:18 That's really impressive, but I don't know if it deserves HoF
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:29:34 I mean HoF has seen alot of unworthy builds
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:32:20 I don;t want to offend anyone, so I'll tell you in dms
creations-chat 2021-02-02 23:42:34 Bar the visible motors underneath  the fuselage, I'd say it's really good!
creations-chat 2021-02-02 23:44:46 Atleast it's barely noticeable
creations-chat 2021-02-02 23:56:37 What's wrong with the intakes? The Hornet has intakes that far back
creations-chat 2021-02-02 23:58:53 I guess they could be tilted, but at that scale is genuinely impossible
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:01:36 Ye I know, also <@748355005874044938> if you're going for 1/1 scale then ye, but the design looks neat
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:03:40 Hornet (first image) 
Super Hornet (second image)
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:05:38 Ohhhhhhhhh
general 2021-02-03 00:06:37 Germany's renowned for over doing everything
general 2021-02-03 00:06:59 Sorry to go off topic by the way
general 2021-02-03 00:08:21 Also maybe make the text stand out a tad more
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:09:17 I'm distracted by the fact Heavy has the Man face
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:11:17 Try more saturated colours, also it should be more of a brown and less of a yellow if you want I can dm you some colours, because slow mode got to slow mode.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:36:29 <@459480683124097045> try motor bending here
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:39:10 Also maybe try smaller cylinders for the gear, but other than that, keep it up
creations-chat 2021-02-03 09:29:50 Currently going through a massive overhaul of my builds, already done a few jets, but I decided to tackle the Sr-71, any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 09:31:57 Motor locked down the middle
creations-chat 2021-02-03 09:34:13 Here it is, also should add, but it's pretty obvious, it's nowhere near completion yet.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 12:45:23 Any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 12:55:47 Ye, not the end of the world lad
creations-chat 2021-02-03 12:57:54 Ye but in this context it comes across as if he's questioning why he didn't upvote. As if he isn't looking for something to improve
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:03:02 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:08:13 Ah, I see, sorry for misjudging although you should give him the benefit of the doubt, the amount of whining kids who mass downvote everyone when they get 1 downvote, and cry why,
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:10:48 I personally liked the Focus, although maybe add a tad more detail, still solid though mate
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:12:49 Maybe try adding the ford logo, also try rounding out the roof a little
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:14:57 Oh I thought he wanted feedback for the focus, E misread the room sorry lol I'm braindead
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:19:21 Maybe try a bit more variety with the colours, such as subtle shading
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:21:51 Also <@!434719879602634762>, any feedback? I'd appreciate it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:25:08 Damn, he "not worth my time"'d it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:28:17 Damn, that's a good point, I think I need to rethink my life
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:33:45 But seriously, any feedback? I would actually appreciate it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:36:57 I had, no-one responded
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:38:58 Roight, I'll figure out someway to incorporate them, might not be able to without ruining the camo  and motor lock, thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:41:02 Some bloke was asking people who downvoted for feedback on their build, and Raz told him not to, I don't know, I've been spectating it but avoiding it at the same time,
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:43:53 Ay Thrizet mate, good to see you, I'd say the second
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:46:18 I mean I only pinged that Pear fella because no one was giving me criticism, also nice Thrizet
creations-chat 2021-02-03 15:20:31 <@!718006867808485447> that the J?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 15:23:27 Oh? I thought the Strike Eagle had conformal tanks, still looks really good
creations-chat 2021-02-04 13:25:55 Current progress on my B-17 any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 13:32:48 Redoing the tail stabiliser right as we speak
creations-chat 2021-02-04 13:46:59 Second
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:27:24 What are you on about?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:33:47 These look nothing alike, mine uses motor lock. How about instead of just assuming things, do some research and if you think they actually look similar for actually ask.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:36:34 Could I request a photo of his B17
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:38:38 He posted that image and said "Did I do the wing thing right" so I thougt it was his
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:42:21 <@466793357318815744>  but my point still stands that instead of going "oh this guy copied me, nice" you should of asked instead of throwing out false allegations
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:46:03 Could have misread the room on that one
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:46:12 That's why I said correct me if I'm wrong
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:47:01 
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:47:04 <@466793357318815744>
creations-chat 2021-02-05 09:48:26 <@466793357318815744> <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:50:45 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:51:19 Wasn't even really an argument
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:51:36 He just accused me of copying his build wheb they're completely
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:51:40 Different
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:51:50 Bar they're both b17's
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 09:52:16 Damn, the prophecy was true
creations-chat 2021-02-07 15:48:39 <@456226577798135808> 4383 that F16's sick, love that afterburner, but the tail stabilizer and canopy could use a little more work
creations-chat 2021-02-07 15:53:43 Rip
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:14:20 Current progress on my B-17
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:16:20 Would you say too long?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:18:55 It's one block shorter than the fuselage
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:25:04 Ye motor bending
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:29:23 Always has been
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:31:25 Wasn't referring to that, and again, no offence lad but I don't particularly care
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:33:27 Ye, makes more sense
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:35:30 Calm down lol, he just said he preferred the term motor bending that's all
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:38:08 No one's heated here though? We're just stating our views on what a term should be called, don't see anyone at eachother's throats
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:40:35 Bruh it's not an argument
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:42:38 I highly doubt <@!387195148741771275>  is pissed off that we call something something else
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:46:04 Wow you said pig in 2021, think about the animals. Last time I'm allowing you to objectify anything
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:27:55 <@343426781442736138>  your custom camo looks very similar to this Su35's from a couple days ago <:PogStare:699130318510227537> <:PogStare:699130318510227537> <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:30:16 Credit to <@693133834656415824> for the sick Su-35, but <@343426781442736138>  your camo has a striking resemblance to it<:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:32:47 Maybe try more saturated colours
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:35:14 Ye
creations-chat 2021-02-14 16:23:36 Current progress on my Sr-71, she is flight worthy, any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 16:26:02 Looks good!
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:50:15 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 00:50:38 Ye probably for the best
creations-chat 2021-02-25 13:19:09 Hawker Harrier gr.3, was wondering if I could get any feedback, it would be appreciated
creations-chat 2021-02-25 13:27:31 Oh, thanks. Ye I can't really seem to find a paint scheme that would go well with it, I could do camo, but I'd have to add even more motor lock. Any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-03-04 12:02:03 Harrier gr.3, was wondering if I could get some feedback??
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:49:38 Updated my Supermarine any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:56:20 Ye, they're only temporary
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:59:01 Do you mean the elevators <@719168864705052802>? I see what you mean, they look well very dinky
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:02:01 A five/four block vert stabalizer though... That would look very, questionable
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:12:28 Sorry for dragging this on a little, but just double checking, gear, elevators and vert?
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:14:30 Roight, thanks mate have a good one
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:26:07 Ye, I do have an idea, but the thing is, it would involve a 4 bladed prop
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:28:46 <@!719168864705052802>  I don't know about this vert to be honest
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:30:46 Also nice 162
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:48:27 Ye that vert doesn't look great
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:50:45 I'm assuming it's a reference to something like final countdown
creations-chat 2021-03-18 13:54:14 I think I'll stick with my previous vert, now I'd like to experiment with that prop
creations-chat 2021-03-18 14:02:55 *A wip in creations feedback?*

creations-chat 2021-04-29 11:19:07 <@713537342610079855> now I'm pretty sure we've all seen a thousand Thomas builds, but I've never seen one nail the face like that. That looks amazing mate
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:13:50 Made an F4U Corsair any thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:15:50 Well it is and it isn't, I'd go the traditional way, like I did with my Spitfire, but I wanted to try something new, something more accurate, also sorry for interrupting, I didn't see the previous conversation lol
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:17:55 No? Some had under slung wings, some had swept back etc.
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:20:33 Ye, but again, I wanted something more accurate to the real life thing
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:22:51 The Hurricane looks nothing like a Corsair, a Spitfire looks nothing like a P-51, the Zero looks nothing like the P-40
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:25:03 No? Dorsal spine layouts are different, wing layout/configuration, the p-40's famous for it's intake
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:27:49 Spitfire, P-51, Zero, BF-109, Fairey Firefly, F4u-corsair, etc.

creations-chat 2021-05-07 23:27:45 <@!719168864705052802> could you lend me any criticism for my F-15 mate

creations-chat 2021-05-09 14:25:15 Well I'll delete the old model, and instead of adding on to the list of F-15's in creations I'll post the final product here for feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-09 14:28:34 The intakes should be longer, appreciated
creations-chat 2021-05-09 14:43:30 Still needs to be beefed up a little, but I'd say it's progress

creations-chat 2021-12-07 23:51:08 We both know that's not what I meant, he built a plane in honour of the lives taken on the day, I mean it ain't the best idea to do a Zero lmao but it's pretty clear to see his intentions were pure
creations-chat 2021-12-07 23:55:15 Just saying you don't have to bully the fella over a questionable choice, I think it's clear to anyone that he wasn't trying to cause conflict lmao. You lot are just reading far too into things

creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:00:10 Aight, my two cents which nobody asked for is, tutorials can be helpful, for instance canopy tuts, nose tuts etc. I don't have a problem if you use one of those types of tuts, I don't use them myself but feel free to, tuts that just build everything for you stunt progress imo, and encourage copying. Don't have an issue if you make tuts, most people I know that do, do them so people don't copy their effortful builds.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:24:19 Cheers, appreciate the feedback mate
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:30:19 Could you elaborate? I'd really appreciate any and all criticisms
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:33:22 Appreciated, I'll get to fixing that.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:40:25 Okay, so about the afterburners, I was trying to imitate the real thing however I see things are proportionally off, and the engines shouldn't just cut off like that

Also <@456226577798135808> I see what you mean about the engines however, they do slightly stick above the fuselage, but ye I see what you mean when you say they go down into the rest of the fuselage, and I'll try get that detail
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:57:50 Meant C, my bad
creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:00:38 Don't apologise for a downvote mate, it's fine, appreciate you pointing that out, I'll smoothen it out
creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:04:53 Roight, whenever you're able to I'd gladly accept the critiques, so far I'm improving the way the engines flow with the fuselage, afterburners, elevators and that seem in the canopy/cockpit
creations-chat 2022-01-02 15:18:36 Sorted out the back, no longer on a weak structure, also fixed the afterburners, also made the engines to fuselage transition more accurate. Anymore critiques would be appreciated
creations-chat 2022-01-02 15:23:02 Anything I should work on?
creations-chat 2022-01-02 15:25:07 Right, thanks
creations-chat 2022-01-05 13:38:35 Updated the F-15 by beefing up the conformal tanks and redoing the rear airframe.
creations-chat 2022-01-05 13:40:47 
creations-chat 2022-01-13 16:58:18 <@668392684729139201> make the rear air structure look more secure
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:41:30 Beautiful drawing
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:43:44 I'd remove that Fa/18, Roscale builds deserve to be put in hof, but that, that one doesn't.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:50:41 It's not an awful build, but like seriously, you're going for hof, and you use stock engines for afterburners, and a standard nose cone.

Edit: That's only some of the complaints I have with it
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:54:03 Fitting the sillohuette is only one part of making a good fighter, and you need to be pushing the limits if you want to try make a hof worthy fighter
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:56:04 I agree, but don't remove old hof builds, they're products of their time (around 2020 onwards should be fine)
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:58:36 How else are you supposed to show that you're good at the game if you don't motor lock every single block into the right place <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:00:45 Better than the Hornet, could prolly get in, but if it's good enough in pcc's eyes is a different story
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:02:50 Ye, but it's unfair to dethrone a good build for the time because it isn't up to today's standards
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:05:56 Prolly the best out of it's competition I guess? I don't know, don't think it deserved the hof position 



<@!401530469952389130> I think a build's only over ml'd when you can achieve the same/better look without ml.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:09:09 I mean they let this go through but not Mad's F-22? Aight ye, totally not biased there <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:11:14 No matter how good it looks, they'll never let it in because Mad does tuts, that thing's much more impressive than the Fa/18 still they didn't let it go through
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:14:46 I still think Overlocking's not an issue unless you can achieve the same/better look with blocks
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:18:42 Ah well then if that's the case I'm safe, I only go in ps's <:trol:911027904182378536>

creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:09:47 I mean you just need to move the canopy forward a block or 2, not really rocket science
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:12:19 Just redesign the canopy to look more accurate and move it forward, then find a way to redo the gear, and choose nicer colours

creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:43:25 Colours kinda fard
creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:49:02 Also fix the canopy
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:59:46 Looks like the Fcas

Looks good though
creations-chat 2022-02-16 00:01:49 That's because t is <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:46:14 Nice, fixed the canopy, but I'd change the colours
creations-chat 2022-02-18 21:19:59 Instead of using 1x1's use 1x2's and lock them down
creations-chat 2022-02-18 21:22:56 <@!414359638302130176> Looks really good if not a little plain

Also how big is it?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 21:29:51 Oh right, so I'm assuming it's roscale?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 21:36:18 I'd try adding the fuselage mounted missiles
creations-chat 2022-02-18 21:39:18 Oh bruh
creations-chat 2022-02-20 00:07:22 You wipe standing up <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-02-20 00:10:50 Naw you wash it in the sink
creations-chat 2022-02-20 17:34:10 I could care less if you're a furry, a bad build's a bad build, too many exposed motors, exposed rockets, unpainted motors, disproportionate, I'll give you one thing, it's well polished with nice details but take those away for a minute and the tomcat underneath is incredibly lacking.
creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:51:52 Two things, I'd add A-pillars (canopy lines) to the canopy, and 2 can you provide a photo of the paint scheme
creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:54:10 Oh is it a custom paint scheme? I thought it was based on a real camo pattern
creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:56:58 Is this what you based it off?
creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:59:50 Aight, give me a minute.
creations-chat 2022-02-23 00:02:31 Try 69, 87, 75, for the green and 161, 125, 82 for the tan colour, it's a good base, just fix the gun, add canopy lines and change the colours (also the intakes)
creations-chat 2022-02-23 00:09:14 Ah, still though, I'd use the colours I recommend, colours can be the thing that determines a good build from a bad one. I mean all the critiques are pretty simple to fix. Just colours, intakes and the gun

creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:08:49 🤔

I'd say it looks closer to a Giga than a Trex
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:12:28 Why does it droop down so much? And it's nowhere near as aggressive looking as the jp/jw rex due to the eyebrow arch not having enough definition
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:15:35 That's the Jw Giga, aka looks nothing like an actual giganotosaurus
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:22:25 Okay but that's not relevant to the discussion, I said your rex's head looks more like a real life Giga than the Jw Trex
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:24:26 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:26:32 The eyebrow arch has to be more pronounced, and look more aggressive to be the Jw rex
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:36:22 Aye but it's closer to what we believe the Giga to look like than the T rex that was designed for the film
