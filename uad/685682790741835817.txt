the-dump 2020-10-06 01:46:29 are lag machines bannable?
the-dump 2020-10-06 01:46:44 if so ban this dude
the-dump 2020-10-06 01:47:24 hes bein annoying spamming his lag machine
general 2020-10-22 15:57:29 stupid lag machine kids
general 2020-10-22 15:57:40 
general 2020-10-22 16:06:38 he was spawning it repeatedly
general 2020-10-22 16:06:43 not blowing it up
general 2020-10-22 16:06:45 just
general 2020-10-22 16:06:47 spawning...
general 2020-10-23 14:49:30 sample text
general 2020-11-08 22:36:32 hey are lag machines bannable
general 2020-11-08 22:36:50 where can I report this guy whos using a lag machine
general 2020-11-08 22:36:54 and shredders
general 2020-11-08 22:37:04 
general 2020-11-08 22:37:04 oh ok thx
general 2020-11-08 22:37:18 wait its locked
general 2020-11-08 22:37:28 you cant type in it
general 2020-11-08 22:38:48 I cant post in reports
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:03:49 I know that the video is really really far up now, but whoever posted those uranium videos is a bro. those things gave me more entertainment than an hour of physics class
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:04:21 oh it was you rowan
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:04:24 rowan
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:04:32 where did you find the uranium vid
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:04:36 that crap epic
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:04:59 I literally just watched both videos twice
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:05:06 where can I find them
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:05:08 nice
the-dump 2020-11-24 21:05:13 thx
general 2020-12-01 00:49:38 guys guess what new map is old map flipped over just found out today
general 2020-12-14 16:24:45 are lag machines bannable like seriously some dude just crashed half a server
general 2020-12-14 16:24:49 I need to know
general 2020-12-14 16:25:13 where can I find a mod or report section to report this guy
general 2020-12-14 16:25:25 
general 2020-12-15 00:23:17 area below the water tank
general 2020-12-15 00:23:18 hey guys check this out
general 2020-12-15 00:23:31 its below the watertank in the underground bunker
general 2020-12-15 00:23:46 my friend
general 2020-12-15 00:23:49 showed me how to get there
general 2020-12-15 00:23:52 with parachute spamming
general 2020-12-22 10:05:28 ok can lag machines please be bannable again someone with a rope lagger just emptied an entire server then crashed it and I cant even join back
general 2020-12-22 10:06:10 as if i had never spoken....
general 2020-12-22 10:06:13 epic
general 2020-12-22 10:06:22 community still as epic as ever
general 2020-12-22 10:08:22 what are these ranks
general 2020-12-22 10:08:30 why do you need ranks in plane crazy
general 2020-12-22 10:08:51 you have to pay for vip servers though
general 2020-12-22 10:08:57 and you can keep idiots out
general 2020-12-22 10:09:18 noice
general 2020-12-22 10:10:05 ok im out this server has too much of a chadley vibe
general 2021-01-07 04:43:38 2will they ever increase the plot size
general 2021-01-07 04:43:48 damn
general 2021-01-07 05:00:05 thicc luigi
general 2021-01-11 19:51:25 well
general 2021-01-11 19:51:28 no one told me 😠
general 2021-01-11 19:51:50 dont call me stupid just cuz I cant read
general 2021-01-11 19:51:55 stupid
general 2021-01-16 19:31:40 off topic, but are they ever going to add new map/increase plot size?
general 2021-01-16 19:32:05 increasing plot size would be understandably difficult, so I see why they wouldnt
general 2021-01-16 19:32:09 but new map would be epic
general 2021-01-16 19:33:09 I appreciate anything they do for the game
general 2021-01-16 19:33:16 a soft code also sounds nice
general 2021-01-16 19:33:28 fidxing invis glitch
general 2021-01-16 19:33:32 would be great
general 2021-01-16 19:33:38 idk if a soft code would do that
general 2021-01-16 19:33:42 im not smart like u gus
general 2021-01-16 19:33:46 nice nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:12:56 bu

general 2021-08-05 08:32:08 
general 2021-08-05 08:32:45 I flew thru the map and clipped in
general 2021-08-05 08:33:18 the motors are attached to the ship
general 2021-08-05 08:33:20 to toggle da clip
general 2021-08-05 08:33:29 but no one really cares about that
general 2021-08-05 08:33:41 what jet was that that you posted
general 2021-08-05 08:34:24 ah
general 2021-08-05 08:34:28 a jet that doesnt exist
general 2021-08-05 08:36:07 but also for the clip you just do something like this
general 2021-08-05 08:36:14 
general 2021-08-05 08:36:22 not that you would ever want to
general 2021-08-05 08:37:09 yeah I can fly as if was above
general 2021-08-05 08:37:21 and shoot people with turrets
general 2021-08-05 08:37:25 oh
general 2021-08-05 08:38:35 your description is very serious
general 2021-08-05 08:39:15 wait
general 2021-08-05 08:39:18 or is that status
general 2021-08-05 08:39:19 idk
general 2021-08-05 08:39:38 lol nice
general 2021-08-05 08:47:53 bio whatever
general 2021-08-05 08:48:01 I dont know how discord works
general 2021-08-05 08:48:32 ah
general 2021-08-05 08:48:46 that's some kind of jet arcade game right
general 2021-08-05 08:49:38 all I know about ace combat is that the physics are similiar to roblox flight simulator
general 2021-10-13 21:59:53 hey dudes
general 2021-10-13 22:00:04 has anyone noticed there was a change in rocket physics
general 2021-10-13 22:00:09 half my builds dont function anymore
general 2021-10-13 22:00:47 <@!467459282250629120>they dont get accelerated from motion in all directions anymore
general 2021-10-13 22:00:52 they work more like fireworks now
general 2021-10-13 22:01:08 my spinny rocket cannons on half my builds now have 0 functionality
general 2021-10-13 22:01:26 no seriously
general 2021-10-13 22:01:44 before the change you could move in any direction and your rockets would be accelerated
general 2021-10-13 22:01:49 now you have to be going forwards
general 2021-10-13 22:02:37 besides the point but this isnt the server to talk about war thunder
general 2021-10-13 22:02:56 fair
general 2021-10-13 22:03:01 fair
general 2021-10-13 22:03:29 the rocket thing is only happening to me?
general 2021-10-13 22:03:37 is anyone in game rn
general 2021-10-13 22:03:41 yes
general 2021-10-13 22:03:43 hi shep
general 2021-10-13 22:03:52 it's not about tracking
general 2021-10-13 22:03:56 it's about rocket acceleration
general 2021-10-13 22:04:08 shep you know what the spinny rocket cannons are right
general 2021-10-13 22:04:10 HV cannons
general 2021-10-13 22:04:26 there been a change in physics for me
general 2021-10-13 22:04:35 rockets only accelerate when you go forwards for me
general 2021-10-13 22:04:41 so my cannons dont work anymore
general 2021-10-13 22:05:03 alright
general 2021-10-13 22:05:20 aurashere
general 2021-10-13 22:05:29 use macros to make firework flak cannon
general 2021-10-13 22:05:33 rocket + suspension
general 2021-10-13 22:09:28 shep
general 2021-10-13 22:09:33 quack helped me figure it out
general 2021-10-13 22:09:37 I reached conclusion
general 2021-10-13 22:09:40 im fucked
general 2021-10-13 22:10:14 wat
general 2021-10-13 22:10:15 oh
general 2021-10-13 22:10:27 you might have changed your display name then I mistook you for a non friend when clearing space
general 2021-10-13 22:10:37 sorry
general 2021-10-13 22:12:41 I think you call them
general 2021-10-13 22:12:42 herd
general 2021-10-13 22:12:53 or mooses
general 2021-10-13 22:13:02 mice idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:13:45 does anyone know if the rocket physics change is permanent
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:14:10 a bunch of my builds used weapons using the old rocket physics to function and they dont work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:14:36 and those builds had to be designed around the weapon so I cant just switch them out
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:19:57 im seriously worried tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:20:09 you know how
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:20:18 no matter what direction you fly in
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:20:26 your rockets will be accelerated if you go fast
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:20:53 you can fly backwards and your rockets would still get the same forward acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:21:05 yes the new change is that they now only move if you go forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:21:17 so all my spinny rocket cannons are broken now
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:21:33 so do I
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:21:51 no you have to be accelerating forwards
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:22:31 it isnt a chase weapon
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:22:36 it's a sniper rifle kinda weapon
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:22:44 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:22:51 its a weapon you dont have to move to use
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:23 just yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:30 loaded up a build with my cannons
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:34 and noticed they didnt work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:45 thought it was serve so switched
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:52 but didnt work anywjhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:06 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:09 elaborate
general 2021-10-13 22:24:37 what your question
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:46 they just dont work?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:59 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:06 that's worse than my situation I guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:17 smiley please
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:27 yeah me too
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:32 ive had my issue for about a weak
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:34 week*
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:26:30 yeah if you dont use any special physics-exploiting weaponry you wont notice any changes
general 2021-10-13 22:26:45 what is that
general 2021-10-13 22:27:08 lemme search it
general 2021-10-13 22:27:29 ohhh yes that would work great with gyros
general 2021-10-13 22:27:41 is it an airship or a vtol-spaceship kinda thing
general 2021-10-13 22:27:56 ive never played fallout
general 2021-10-13 22:28:06 so idk what kind of game it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:37:38 hey does anyone know if there's a way to contact people workin on the game
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:38:14 it's not about that
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:38:31 I need to ask a question about a recent change in the rocket physics
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:38:47 cuz bunch of my stuff doesnt work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:39:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:39:15 like rocket launchers
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:39:33 inertia can only be converted into rocket speed if you are going forwards now
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:40:01 so my spinny rocket cannons which use inertia going sideways to shoot them faster dont work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:40:23 could  I contact a mod about that
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:40:40 I can name people besides me who also used those physics to make cannons
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:40:47 and their builds wont work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:41:39 really tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:41:48 so many of my builds used the cannons as their main weapon
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:42:04 I want to know that someone at least ackowledges that people
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:42:10 people's builds are broken
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:42:34 I have like
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:42:38 big big slow spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:43:00 and all of them are built around having the cannons as their weapons
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:43:10 so I can shoot down planes and snipe far away targets
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:43:43 idk who golden sword is but he probably didnt design his whole ships around his weapons
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:43:53 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:44:54 even if this doesnt get fixed I just want to make sure someone considers that people's builds arent functioning
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:45:21 I can accept that it wont change just as long as someone gives us a thought
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:45:41 bro the cannons arent small
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:45:43 they whole builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:45:49 they dont function anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:46:19 my big old ship literally
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:46:27 half of the ship is carved out to make room for an HV cannon
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:46:31 it's designed around it
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:46:44 spinny rocket cannon*
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:46:56 it's the only weapon on the ship
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:47:32 rockets dissapearing?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:47:38 that has not actually happened to me
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:47:55 but that thing he described is what im doing so I guess it probably wont be fixed
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:14 or unfixed idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:20 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:27 legacy box?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:29 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:42 wait what
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:48:53 is that a new thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:49:08 I guess I havnt placed any rockets recently so I didnt notice
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:49:16 if this works I owe you my thanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:49:40 it's a racist book
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:49:51 1984 is
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:49:58 iifanik
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:50:03 how do I enable the legacy box
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:50:35 maybe the book itself isnt racist but I heard the author had some issues
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:50:43 I havnt read it so I cant say
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:50:54 iifanik
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:51:17 iifanik
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:51:22 how do you do the legacy box thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:51:42 I am looking at it
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:52:25 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:52:30 it only works in vip
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:52:40 I happen to not play in vip servers
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:52:42 ever
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:52:48 so im fucked then
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:53:09 thanks for telling me tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:53:36 good to know I can still get them to work even if I cant use them in  combat anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:54:00 show it to us first
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:54:54 looks very good
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:04 the only thing I would think you need to change is the nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:09 noses are hard in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:19 everything else looks dope
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:28 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:37 is it an acid plane?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:46 like a pvp centered plane?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:55:59 one of those planes that does break neck turns and flies at impossible speeds
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:56:12 I have an irrational hatred of those planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:56:23 good
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:57:14 I dont like when people take a beautiful aircraft then ruin all the coolness of it by making it look like a shredder in flight
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:57:17 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:57:27 a glitch?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:57:55 for me they never miss
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:58:07 they always spawnkill me
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:58:18 and target me in my sub-800 planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:58:25 and ships
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:58:38 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:59:03 I wouldnt mind the killing and sweatyness of the planes if it werent for the players always being incredibly toxic
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:59:07 and rude
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 07:59:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:06 never thought about it but that is very true
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:25 gjsolo was always mean to me too
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:27 ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:38 not in a toxic way tho he was chill
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:47 he just killed me a lot
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:00:56 I like his shredder killin vids
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:01:02 good use of acid planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:01:37 wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:01:51 it makes the rocket go normal no matter what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:01:56 will it accelerate?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:02:14 ah
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:02:17 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:02:39 makes me feel better that they actually knew people exploited the physics
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:02:43 and that was why they changed it
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:02:57 cuz it means they didnt just disregard people
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:03:00 's builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:03:22 what is a wyvern?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:03:36 cool sounding name for a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:03:46 oh ace combat that old video game with the crap physics
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:04:28 I saw gameplay of those games only like once and even I could tell that the physics are marginal
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:04:50 they are arcade style games
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:04:53 not realistic
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:05:14 is that plane with the folding wings the wyvern?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:05:16 it looks sick
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:05:46 that;s a pretty awesome looking cobra
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:05:59 those physics look nice and smooth
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:06:01 vey impressive
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:06:24 the better option
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:06:28 is what it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:06:29 apparently
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:07:12 your car shouldnt get air
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 08:07:43 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:18:37 hey does anyone else use toggleable hover drives with landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:19:16 my builds that use them have recently started suddenly dropping from the sky
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:19:23 at random intervals
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:19:39 all physics suddenly shatter and nothing is interactable until I reset
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:20:00 yes essentially
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:20:13 are they going to fix this issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:20:24 eh
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 05:20:28 answer probably no anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:00:31 SERIOUS ON TOPIC QUESTION
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:01:17 when in the fuck are they going to fix this bug
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:02:37 my two best, highest effort builds are completely out of commission cuz hover engines on motor2 cause the whole game to shit yourself
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:03:06 this bug only started happening a week ago
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:04:11 I know I dont have the authority to do anything but this make me angry asf
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:04:29 idk if they gonna fix it or not idk if my best builds will ever fly again
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:04:33 yea
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:04:43 he designed the base for the ship in that clip
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:05:14 you too?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:05:19 thank god im not the only one
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:05:27 I found the issue though
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:05:47 I did a bunch of control tests and found that the only builds that break are ones that use hover engines attached to motor2
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:06:04 but I couldnt figure out how to fix it
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:06:18 all I wanna know is if they are gonna fix that bug
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:06:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:06:48 they worked fine after  I removed the motor2 hovers tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:07:05 the issue is that they control all the turning and I cant do any alternative engines
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:07:17 rocket engines create a drag loop which would ruin the balance
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:07:28 they arent keyboard turning
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:07:43 mouse for the turning keyboard for the movement
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:03 what's new is this fkcing bug that breaks good builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:09 oh wait it is?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:35 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:41 is there a place I can report bugs
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:46 a suggestion would help alot
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:08:53 if I can just let someoone know it exists
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:03 no for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:09 sorry we were talking about something else
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:14 ah
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:37 ive only started experiencing it within the week and ive had the two broken ships for a while
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:44 and they both worked fine before
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:09:53 thx voyager
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:01 ey
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:06 I got bug
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:45 my builds with hover engines just started doin this my good builds are completely out of commission now
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:11:12 yes those two things are what I found to be the cuase
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:11:13 cause
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:11:46 asked players about it in <#384021699466756107> and several people reported experiencing the same thing
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:12:24 all physics cease to function (except trails still make the trail) and the build goes willy wonko across the map
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:12:53 tell me
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:12:56 how did it happen for you
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:13:12 I jus reported it in <#498473314445033472> btw
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:14:36 it aint about turning
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:14:46 you can kill a fast turning jet if its'' top speed is 200
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:16:18 it's the combination of fast turning, 800+ speed, and all 12 rockets
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:16:59 also who r u
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:17:10 how do you know me
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:19:22 but also I actually want devs to see that bug
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:19:42 cuz it's serious
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 23:57:34 looks like a tryhard cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 23:57:46 you better not screw up the rest of the plane <@!419477639229865984>
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:05:19 if someone dont at least see this bug this time I swear to god so many of my builds dont work anymore cuz of the new motor2 hover drive bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:06:01 after the stutter total loss of physics and control
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:06:33 getting out and getting back in does not solve the issue
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:10 3 of my best ships and a helicopter I have no longer function for more than a minute within spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:33 ree
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:56 the only use for this is teleportation but I did testing and there's no way to control when it happens
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:00 and it kills your build
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:48 <@!217336009455566848>  if you fix this bug I will donate all my roux
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:51 no cap
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:09:13 I mean I dont have much left but I will donate it all
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:13:43 fr tho if that bug doesnt get fixed my best bilds are gon be broken foreva
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:10 I cant switch hover drives for a different kind of engine
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:21 regular thrusters and engines make a drag loop
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:30 which throws off the balance of da ships
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:16:00 cool but wrong channel
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:17:51 putting this video back here one more time 4 good measure someone fix dis bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:18:44 again it happen with hover drives and motor 2s in the same grid
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:19:05 had several other people tell me they also experienced this bug as well
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:06 if you arent trolling when you say that, I have literally tried every different technique I know, I swapped the motors around, I switched the hover drive from pistons to springs to suspensions to landing gear, and I stated that it does not function anyways if you use normal rockets or prop engines because it throws off the balance which takes hours to get perfect
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:47 that's
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:49 it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:49 how
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:50 was
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:52 designed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:53 to work
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:22 I literally just said those make a drag loop which throws off the balance and they arent powerful enough anyways
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:37 Im talking about my turning mechanism
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:40 not my propulsion
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:00 I just said
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:02 they dont work
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:17 please tell me you arent trolling because the only way to fix it is to delete the ship or fix the bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:25 im being dead serious
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:00 ive already tried all the things you listed and they dont function properly
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:23 my ships are literally designed around the turning engines
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:35 changing them to flaps would mean deleting the ship and rebuilding it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:52 it's designed to work with mouse turning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:55 not wasd
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:10:23 that would mean deleting my ship
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:10:45 you are giving me solutions which just create more problems
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:11:24 I can't tell whether you're being serious or not but you aren't helping
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:19 my ships dont work with wasd
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:26 what is it that you dont understand
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:44 how do I mute someone
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:15:41 shame
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:16:48 and also nemesis it isnt my job to fix bugs in the game by breaking my own builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:17:01 literally the whole point of this channel/why I posted it here
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:18:17 the reason I said that is cuz I posted about it before and there was no response whatsoever
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:18:53 why does no one talk about it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:09 ?
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:15 pardon I forgot what that means
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:27 brh
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:48 so it's just too minor of a bug for anybody to care about fixing it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:20:28 3 of my best ships which I spent hours making wont work again unless that bug is fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:12 true it is fun to tumble but an uncontrolled tumble is just a crash
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:19 I want my builds back
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:42 I spent money on this game I at least expect my stuff to work properly
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:20 this is a ship I built right before the bug started effecting my builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:45 doesn't look like much, but I actually spent over 4 hours making everything perfect
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:57 it doesnt function properly with any other engine controlling the turning mechanism
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:14 
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:23 I don't have a video yet for the other 2 ships but I can get one in a jiffy
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:35 cuz I only really use the one in the video
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:38 used*
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:23 I know exactly what causes it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:44 yes
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:49 always within a minute
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:51 of spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:07 sometimes it might survive for 2 minutes
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:16 or sometimes it will break within 2 seconds of spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:38 it is a bug on the engines that control the t u r n i n g
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:44 nemesis
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:55 the engines are on g i m b a l s
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:26:11 g_i_m_b_a_l_s
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:26:28 I cannt simply swap them for something different
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:27:45 ?
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:31:17 place hover drive on any grid with a motor 2 attached to it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:31:25 motor 2 can have any settings
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:32:22 hover drive can use any medium (pistons/motors/springs/suspension)
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:32:53 it also bugged out a helicopter  I was trying to build because the blades were tilted with motor 2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:33:22 for a specific example outside spaceships
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:33:33 with gimbal engines
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:34:11 I will buy more roux and donate it -NO CAP- if this bug gets fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:40:00 alrite
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:42:22 <@!217336009455566848>
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:42:41 these are several different kinds of standalone hover drives
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:43:07 hover engines will not only react with the ground and other player builds, but will also react to seperate grids in your own builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:43:43 hundreds (if not thousands) of players use them as a way of very fast propulsion as they are very powerful
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:44:17 they will not affect parts attached using locked motors
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:00 the bug im experiencing is caused when a grid with a hover drive is attached to a grid with a motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:13 or actuated by a motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:28 several other players ive talked to also experience this bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:57 it causes your game to stutter for about half a second, after which all loss of physics occurs and your build plummets from the sky
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:46:14 only way to fix is by respawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:49:36 actually it appears the glitch might have been fixed with the new update just now
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:49:40 im not experiencing it anymore
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:34 well
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:41 it seems that
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:46 the problem has actually been fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:56 there was an update just now
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:51:02 im no longer experiencing the bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:52:22 yes it is very good 🙂
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:52:27 I am very happy
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:53:06 I DONATE ROUX NOW
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:53:57 oof dont have enough roux left to donate gota buy moar
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:54:04 epic game

the-dump 2021-11-06 18:34:22 
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:10:32 I can relate to this a little
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:16:28 my bad just wanted him to know that feeling is normal
general 2021-11-11 18:18:05 <@!611251614178869269> what is a jackal
general 2021-11-11 18:18:37 cuz those ships were just triangles to begin with
general 2021-11-11 18:18:44 no real design base
general 2021-11-11 18:19:05 ah I see
general 2021-11-11 18:19:18 I think it's kinda cool
general 2021-11-11 18:19:22 never played cod tho
general 2021-11-11 18:19:38 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:20:04 got damn man

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:24:29 it is the gyros
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:24:41 and motorlock is way too heavy for vtols
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:25:26 this is top down
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:25:44 that midsection I wish I could fix too
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 18:26:00 but if I moved the gyros to the outside it would look plain s i l l y

creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:04:49 I mean as in like, his build looks pretty good but it still got downvoted to hell did he do something or what
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 18:06:09 <@!611251614178869269> I wasnt talking about my build bro

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 18:09:29 wat u mean
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 18:09:42 how I improve .-.
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 18:09:57 oh exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:10:45 I am asking about why the VIGGEN got downvoted, not my A 10 (I already know why mine did cuz it sucks)
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:12:47 I think making the angle on that tail a bit less intense would help but idk what plane you're making
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:35:58 SERIOUSSSS QUESTION
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:36:04 can you attach magnets to OTHER PPL
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:46:01 I started having this bug again that was fixed in the last update. It is not a server problem because it happened in any server I went to.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:46:17 Happens with hover engines that are attached to motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:00 spoke with <@!217336009455566848>  about it last time, but issue was never clarified
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:32 4 of my builds are currently out of order again due to this bug
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:37 including the 2 in the videos
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:48:17 The little stutter then loss of physics is the result of the bug.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:50:01 Getting out then getting back in does not fix the bug.

plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:44 Ey I got a question about the rules for anyone
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:40:28 Are there any enforced rules in plane crazy that could result in disciplinary action?
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:40:40 I feel like plane crazy is kinda lawless
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:41:05 Bruh

plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:52:24 Where people giver their builds :fly or some crap and their plane starts aimbotting you while flying sideways
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:57:50 No she Heckin can’t cuz that’s not even a moskeeto

plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:43:18 In case you still need an answer the trail is connected to the side of the motor’s base
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:44:18 Yes lol this
general 2022-02-08 04:41:51 how do you make a suggestion
general 2022-02-08 04:41:57 for a change to the game'
general 2022-02-08 04:43:32 no what channel
general 2022-02-08 04:43:34 where do I go
general 2022-02-08 04:43:50 no how do I put one in
general 2022-02-08 04:43:57 you cant just say stuff in that channel
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 04:45:28 how do I put a suggestion into <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 04:52:13 oh good point
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 04:52:25 and yes just a shit ton of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 04:52:39 they havnt added the funny tool yet
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 02:57:06 Yo yo yo wouldn’t it be funny if
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 02:57:19 Wouldn’t it be funny if plane crazy 2 got released for April fools
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 02:57:23 That would be funny
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:06:36 ayo wtf is this
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:07:15 happens whenever  I attach a hover drive to a motor
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:07:31 whole thing loses physics and starts spazzing
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:08:09 that's just lag
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:32:28 Can confirm it’s not a lag issue. Based on what I’ve seen, it only happens when you attach a hover drive (usually on its own wit jus hover engine + motor/piston) to a motor/motor 2

I build spaceships which use sortuhh gimbal hover drives for turning, and it breaks them repeatedly and gets very annoying
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:32:48 Also broke a helicopter I made once that used hover drives to spin the rotor
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:33:41 Doesn’t affect everybody, just certain players, and every few months the bug stops acting up, particularly after a roblox update or a game update
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:35:27 The build will do fine for a few seconds after spawning (or a few minutes) then will experience a single wild convulsion, which then all physics/thrusters quit working, and your build falls out of the sky as though wing panels were nonexistent
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:36:01 And it will keep convulsing and lagging until you de spawn and try again
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:36:57 What device
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:06 Ohhh
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:22 That might actually be the case
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:32 I tried playing on my friends pc and it didn’t happen
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:53 Although after roblox updates the bug usually goes away for a while
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:39:06 And then pops up again randomly
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:39:55 You know any solutions
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:40:09 The bug makes me literally wanna rip my skull out
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:40:57 I see
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:41:06 Thanks for the info
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:53:56 ah yes good ole invis glitch
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:54:10 no it will never be fixed because that would make the world a good place
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:54:13 and nobody wants that
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:20 you won't like the answer
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:22 to that question
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:37 it has nothing to do with the game
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:48 roblox removed all copyrighted/original music ids from roblox
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:51 over 6 seconds long
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:10 then they probably just got rid of it
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:13 for some reason
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:20 ids get deleted all the time
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:44 there you go
creations-chat 2022-04-14 00:38:08 I gotta admit that's pretty heckin neat
bug-reports 2022-04-14 01:00:25 lol and it's supposed to be protecting the original creator by deleting it
creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:25:05 holy shit that's cooler than zane from lego ninjago
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:26:19 known glitch, it is indeed very annoying, you'll just have to replace them everytime you spawn or use another block
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:26:38 when I get it I just replace them everytime I load the save
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:27:11 if you have any idea what is causing it for you, however, then that could be very helpful to figuring out the cause of the bug

bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:33:30 ?
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:33:59 sorry can rephrase that I legitimately have no idea what you are trying to say there
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:34:29 in order for the glitch to happen?
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:34:41 on my tank the arrow points upwards and it still does it
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:34:47 ah I see

bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:35:07 thx
creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:35:36 can I fly a ship inside your ship
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:37:15 <@853923968041353236> ey
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:37:33 would you mind if I landed a ship on that carrier of yours
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:37:59 finding good space carriers is super rare and this opportunity will not likely come again
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:38:37 no it's his he made the full post
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:38:52 it would be pretty weird to have all those pictures if it wasnt your ship

plane-crazy 2022-04-14 15:39:45 so might as well ask

plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:09:45 <@266017174693478410> the two gimbal hover engines counteract each other, which creates nice cursor-point turning when combined with good balance of lift and weight
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:10:09 the shuttle in creations uses the same thing but bigger
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:11:19 ?
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:11:53 heavy motor locking isnt a viable option for gyro ships
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:12:00 you have to keep it light
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:13:44 I don't mean weight or falling, I mean the ship would wobble from excessive mass at both ends
