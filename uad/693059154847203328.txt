general 2020-10-10 16:59:39 Imagine breaking Roblox
Adopt me:"heavy sweating"

general 2020-10-10 17:11:39 MAN DOWN, WE GOT A MAN DOWN
general 2020-10-10 17:12:05 Well, we're doomed
general 2020-10-10 17:13:04 I don't think private servers will even survive
general 2020-10-10 17:14:03 The data base is broken
general 2020-10-10 17:15:32 Well, pray to the gods above that Roblox datasave doesn't crash, or else we might have to redo all our builds
general 2020-10-10 17:17:13 They ARE STILL JOINING even tho Roblox is down
general 2020-10-10 17:17:47 Should I see what's happening to Roblox?

general 2020-11-23 15:38:59 How often do you fight shredders?
general 2020-11-23 15:39:26 For me, every single day, theres 3
general 2020-11-23 15:39:36 **at least**
general 2020-11-23 15:40:13 My toyota can clap them easily
general 2020-11-23 15:40:29 Why not make the a plus symbol
general 2020-11-23 15:40:39 Lol
general 2020-11-23 15:41:08 Theres at least 3 shredd3r tutorials m8
general 2020-11-23 15:41:53 Someone called a b2 spirit a f199 and saying that its not a tutorial but its visable

general 2020-11-23 15:47:55 Whos the creator of shredders
general 2020-11-23 15:48:10 I want to send a present
general 2020-11-23 15:48:56 Filled with 200grams of high explosive gift card
general 2020-11-23 15:49:40 Ah yes, DEHYDRATED water
general 2020-11-24 15:02:39 Any chance you guys know 224jay?
general 2020-11-24 15:02:51 Well
general 2020-11-24 15:03:01 I fought him just now
general 2020-11-24 15:03:10 Well
general 2020-11-24 15:03:21 I think it counts as i win
general 2020-11-24 15:03:24 I think
general 2020-11-24 15:03:34 So
general 2020-11-24 15:03:46 He has this jet, going mach 1
general 2020-11-24 15:04:14 So i got out my sepecat jaguar
general 2020-11-24 15:04:39 Proceed to out turn him somehow
general 2020-11-24 15:04:59 Then shot 10 guns
general 2020-11-24 15:05:24 Clipped a lot of his control surfaces
general 2020-11-24 15:06:20 The only damage he did to me, was just 3 1x1 wing panels
general 2020-11-24 15:06:51 Meanwhile i shot about 5 holes into his wing
general 2020-11-24 15:07:14 Clipped a tilted wing
general 2020-11-24 15:07:21 Oi dont
general 2020-11-24 15:07:50 I forgot to mention i was using wasd controls
general 2020-11-24 15:08:01 No mouse control what so ever
general 2020-11-24 15:08:14 .
general 2020-11-24 15:08:39 Just out turning him and dodging his missiles
general 2020-11-24 15:09:10 He was using a new plane i think
general 2020-11-24 15:09:41 He has conveyour engines, meanwhile i motor locked rocket engines
general 2020-11-24 15:10:00 E
general 2020-11-24 15:10:19 He wasnt talking tho
general 2020-11-24 15:10:24 Or insulting
general 2020-11-24 15:11:10 Does jay insult often?
general 2020-11-24 15:11:30 Strange
general 2020-11-24 15:11:52 He didnt talk while i fought him for well over 40 mins
general 2020-11-24 15:12:21 So all that time, i was focusing so hard
general 2020-11-24 15:12:47 I had sweaty palms and even had a headache
general 2020-11-24 15:13:19 Going under the map is the best way to fight him
general 2020-11-24 15:14:10 He will reverse since he doesnt want to grind the plane onto the ground above
general 2020-11-24 15:14:35 Then you shoot him with 10 guns or fire rockets
general 2020-11-24 15:14:55 Thats how i clipped his wing
general 2020-11-24 15:15:20 Then i went afk and he still couldnt kill me
general 2020-11-24 15:15:52 Maybe its because he uses mouse control for pitch
general 2020-11-24 15:16:24 I used wasd control and managed to out turn him for a long time
general 2020-11-24 15:16:41 ...
general 2020-11-24 15:17:06 Why would you ask or even think about it...
general 2020-11-24 15:17:19 Wut
general 2020-11-24 15:17:39 Anyways
general 2020-11-24 15:18:05 My plane apparently can go submarine mode so i went underwater to rest
general 2020-11-24 15:18:39 I dont eat veggies much so no thank you
general 2020-11-24 15:19:23 What
general 2020-11-24 15:19:41 Why...
general 2020-11-24 15:20:19 Mine was a jet but it was stable
general 2020-11-24 15:20:45 I can fix shaking by just doing a barrel roll
general 2020-11-24 15:21:29 My sepecat is now my main fighter jet
general 2020-11-24 15:22:34 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752070970260586506/780769280127795210/unknown.png
general 2020-11-24 15:23:06 Irl, this jet has rockets on top of the wings
general 2020-11-24 15:23:58 The fact that jay cant kill me
general 2020-11-24 15:24:11 Makes me feel like a god
general 2020-11-24 15:24:36 Why are you asking for help from americans?
general 2020-11-24 15:25:05 What issues you have there m8?
general 2020-11-24 15:25:52 Wut
general 2020-11-24 15:29:28 Those wings are a bit too long i think
general 2020-11-24 15:29:39 But keep up the work
general 2020-11-25 09:06:02 why cant we have mods on plane crazy?
general 2020-11-25 09:06:25 someone made a nsfw thing here

general 2020-11-28 08:08:52 "Gear up" in a fixed gear aircraft

general 2020-12-22 15:44:40 But this todler keeps going on and on and on
general 2020-12-22 15:46:12 This is for talking not arguing like some 6 year olds arguing over toys

general 2020-12-22 16:05:46 I wonder what this guy wants to say now
general 2020-12-22 16:07:11 You must be so idiotic to think that going into a conversation that doesnt have anything to do with you is being "cool"

creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:24:19 Any ideas for details to add?
general 2021-01-06 15:25:24 anyone has suggestion for more details to add?
general 2021-01-06 15:26:39 okay?
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:28:09 should i add more textures? (looks kinda plain)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:36:34 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:38:55 Imma add ladder armors
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:54:26 does this guy even build decent builds, no offence but if pyro has good builds then his standards are high naturally
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:56:58 im not saying pyro...
creations-chat 2021-01-06 15:59:59 No joke, i went to see the guy who said pyro mass downvoted (idk if true or not) but when i looked into the guy who pinged pyro and his builds, its literary a black dorito with guns and rockets
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:02:01 basically, y e s ( btw, your hawker hunter may need to be thinner, just saying)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:05:03 looks better and btw, i was saying the kid who pinged you. use edit to beat the cooldown why not?
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:09:00 the
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:13:42 downvoting is someone trying to motivate/ messing with you/ doesnt like the category of creation that you made/ your builds have some inaccuracy or missing something/ that person doesnt like you honestly. Those are basically the reason people downvoted builds that i can think of.
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:16:00 its basically when they spot your build has something lacking such as details or missing blocks (talking about downvoting, he just downvoted my car, its fine. i find it lacking something anyways)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:18:49 when i see my creation downvoted i just tell myself to do better so they will one day upvote
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:21:29 well "someday" is gonna be very long since i find myself useless when looking at builds of hof (hof is hall of fame, its a channel where the best builds are)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:31 well pyro downvoted my build, now i feel like i still need improvement (btw can the cooldown be a bit shorter?)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:25:49 well, i cant build something as good, but i feel like im getting there ( cooldown somewhat annoying not gonna lie)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:27:57 i think that is a deathwish my dude (btw, i cant do very complicated motor locks <:nooo:787097964946259978> ) (rbk, thats my tank btw <:pain:644301805534183464> )
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:30:32 it was intended as a pvp tank since i have to face people with tanks going 500 -  600 sps, but i decided to give another purpose to it so i put details.
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:32:46 im not a good photographer, not really a good builder nor am i a specialist at anything, but i keep trying even if the odds are stacked
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:36:41 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/761097244581298226 welp, i guess this creation is the one that has the most upvotes... its like last year, was still new to the game
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:39:45 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/784454016695271464 this little guy somehow got 29 upvotes, feels like everyone was excited about christmas anyways.
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:42:23 That looks good not gonna lie, but some people dont like it as much tho. But i dont think its hof worthy. If you put more details into it, then i think it is hof worthy ( the bar at the front maybe? )
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:44:34 that tank should be hof worthy, just dont know why didnt it get to hof
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:47:55 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/775362909017473076 now that is some good timing for the pic
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:49:56 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/775406862580973579 how did that not get into hof????
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:52:59 it looks like  a p51 because it is the a36 which inspired the p51 (uses same airframe)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 12:28:07 is there a way to make strobe lights without spamming a button?
general 2021-01-07 12:29:48 is there a way to make flashing lights without spamming buttons?

general 2021-01-11 15:53:57 Y e s
general 2021-01-11 15:59:32 Okay, no offense, but i feel like most thai pc players either have tutorial builds and they try to flex with it, try to be toxic and has shredders

general 2021-01-11 16:13:51 My dude, a guy was trying to copy my type 93 since it killed his shredder, failed to copy, failed to even try to shoot, brag about how my truck was trash and me using hacks, told me he had a friend who had better builds, said he will call a mod on me despite there being no mods and then proceed to report me.
general 2021-01-11 16:15:38 I like how this one kid said theres mods in the game and i told him theres none. He said "lies, all of it are lies"

general 2021-01-24 23:11:24 Rick whats the ideal map you want?

general 2021-01-24 23:12:43 Ah so low lag, less terrain, a little more ocean and more buildings?
general 2021-01-24 23:13:25 So flat land?

general 2021-01-24 23:14:42 Idk
general 2021-01-24 23:15:14 I mean, i can make an entire airport for plane crazy

general 2021-01-24 23:20:03 Windows not destroyable
general 2021-01-24 23:20:42 To reduce lag so i wont add destroyable windows
general 2021-01-24 23:24:10 Okay heres my idea, i will add a port but remove the gravel land near the ocean, then extend the ocean a bit since it adds a lot of lag, then i will redesign the airport while removing the hill, and also rerouting the rails to the airport and port. The lava pool will be upgraded to a small volcano
general 2021-01-24 23:24:19 Any more ideas?
general 2021-01-24 23:24:35 *lava
general 2021-01-24 23:25:01 Bruh

general 2021-02-08 08:54:43 Dont worry
general 2021-02-08 08:54:54 Just use alt accounts
general 2021-02-08 08:56:24 I have an idea
general 2021-02-08 08:56:52 What if we use alt accounts wih troll vehicles that look good and let them copy it
general 2021-02-08 08:58:18 make a good looking car, then put tnt in it, put it as w to explode, we use shift to drive
general 2021-02-08 08:58:46 b r u h
general 2021-02-08 08:58:52 then..
general 2021-02-08 08:58:57 O H
general 2021-02-08 08:59:10 what if we make a time bomb?
general 2021-02-08 08:59:14 is it possible?
general 2021-02-08 08:59:41 Set the tnt to w then use shift to drive
general 2021-02-08 09:00:05 no
general 2021-02-08 09:00:14 smokes can be turned off in settings
general 2021-02-08 09:00:26 but idk if those kids know how to
general 2021-02-08 09:00:51 my personal advice is to use spotlights and fireworks
general 2021-02-08 09:01:08 use spotlight at full power and spam firework
general 2021-02-08 09:01:47 firework will drop their fps if they have their cam view close to their avatar and spotlights will make it so they cant build with god brightness
general 2021-02-08 09:02:07 go try it out
general 2021-02-08 09:02:17 strap spotlights at full power and fireworks
general 2021-02-08 09:02:45 firework drops fps and if they have crappy mobile/laptop/pc, then they will crash
general 2021-02-08 09:03:03 that kid?
general 2021-02-08 09:03:08 OH GOD
general 2021-02-08 09:03:12 WHY
general 2021-02-08 09:03:40 looks like its smurking
general 2021-02-08 09:03:52 why the hell...
general 2021-02-08 09:04:23 whats the arguement...
general 2021-02-08 09:05:06 oh god...
general 2021-02-08 09:05:23 which guy?
general 2021-02-08 09:05:31 the whitename unde?
general 2021-02-08 09:05:56 
general 2021-02-08 09:06:02 lol
general 2021-02-08 09:06:09 dont worry its an image
general 2021-02-08 09:06:36 okay what happened exactly?
general 2021-02-08 09:06:45 ...
general 2021-02-08 09:06:55 how much of an unde can you be?
general 2021-02-08 09:08:30 first of all, asking to copy someones build is not advisable as you are trying to copy someones build which they worked hard on
secondly, if you wanted to copy someones build and cry about not getting a proper response, might as well shut up and get good
general 2021-02-08 09:09:07 even worse
general 2021-02-08 09:09:15 xa?

general 2021-02-08 09:10:02 well yes since that kid over there is not satisfied
general 2021-02-08 09:10:09 
general 2021-02-08 09:10:54 no one cares if its unfair since you are a copy cat who cant even build
general 2021-02-08 09:11:34 and america banned huawei

general 2021-02-10 09:42:45 Not the one i was in
general 2021-02-10 09:43:02 Mine was just people who build ships
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:13:01 ?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:15:48 anything you need me to answer since the video is yours and if you say that i copied yours, i never watched the vid nor did i know of it until you pinged me
general 2021-02-10 10:16:41 this dude in creations feedback pinged me to give a link to his own video for a ah1
general 2021-02-10 10:17:06 just because i showed a pic of my ah1s
general 2021-02-10 10:17:29 
general 2021-02-10 10:17:32 w o w
general 2021-02-10 10:17:35 this dude
general 2021-02-10 10:18:07 dont care if he owns one
general 2021-02-10 10:18:32 if he wants to hunt me down, good luck to him
general 2021-02-10 10:20:02 
general 2021-02-10 10:20:04 this is his heli
general 2021-02-10 10:20:25 
general 2021-02-10 10:20:28 and this is mine
general 2021-02-10 10:21:36 first of all, the livery is different, then the rotor is different, the landing spars are different, the tail design is different, the cockpit is different as well
general 2021-02-10 10:22:06 everything is different other than the heli that we based it on
general 2021-02-10 10:22:21 this dude
general 2021-02-10 10:22:44 and i posted this a long time ago but was deleted after i got banned for the first time
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:25:29 well if you look closer its different unless you are blind or you want to argue that i stole your damn design when i dont even have to
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:28:31 unless you want to argue then dont seek attention. its useless to claim its your idea when the heli that we based on is the same. If you insist why dont bell sue all of us for copyright since we based the heli on the ah1 line
general 2021-02-10 10:29:06 creation feedback gonna have an arguement
general 2021-02-10 10:29:30 <@!732289588575338598>
general 2021-02-10 10:29:34 talk here
general 2021-02-10 10:30:12 listen here, if you think i copied your stupid ass heli why not use your brain to think when we used the same base for the heli
general 2021-02-10 10:30:48 he claims i copied his ugly ass heli
general 2021-02-10 10:31:09 ping em here
general 2021-02-10 10:32:06 ?
general 2021-02-10 10:32:18 its a yt vid
general 2021-02-10 10:32:24 its at creation feedback
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:34:33 well i dont see why you want to claim that i copied you when the fucking design is different and the fact that its the same heli that we based on makes it obivous you are trying to "claim" i copied you. Use common sense, its the ah1 line. mine is a ah1s when yours looks more like a ah1z. If you mind, kindly look closer with your eyes
general 2021-02-10 10:35:25 <@!732289588575338598>
general 2021-02-10 10:35:32 talk here
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:38:12 wow, if you really said i copied why not think of the fact that i was here before you were and the fact that you joined 10 days ago. If you still have a brain then look at the damn photo since you dont understand whats called a difference. If you want to argue go to <#497142796961054721>  im not scared of your stupid talk. Dont just accuse someone of copying when you dont have proves of it.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:40:43 As you finally understand, then think next time before you accuse someone of copying your builds or else you will start a useless arguement
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:44:32 and you said its a ah1, mine was a ah1s which was made for japan. Now excuse me as i have something to do other than being in the stupid arguement
general 2021-02-10 13:05:50 9pm for me
general 2021-02-10 13:06:10 
general 2021-02-10 15:40:46 should i redo the livery or keep it?
general 2021-02-10 15:41:44 what?
general 2021-02-10 15:41:50 aight
general 2021-02-10 15:41:56 thanks lol
general 2021-02-10 15:42:43 was limited on locks for performance
creations-chat 2021-02-10 15:43:17 not ugly, may need to shorten the hull a bit. Then it would be up to scale
creations-chat 2021-02-10 15:45:57 aight keep up the good work
general 2021-02-10 15:52:46 yeah
general 2021-02-10 15:52:49 really dead
general 2021-02-10 15:53:01 and also did you guys see a new vid on yt by proto?
general 2021-02-10 15:53:18 he explained everything about pc tutorials
general 2021-02-10 15:53:24 damn what a legend
general 2021-02-10 15:55:11 do you think he is standing up for the community?
general 2021-02-10 15:55:29 e
general 2021-02-10 15:55:55 "what is the purpose of a building game if you build pre-built ones"
general 2021-02-10 15:56:06 that explains everything
general 2021-02-10 15:56:37 rens just make it because of demand
general 2021-02-10 15:56:46 cause last time he told me about it
general 2021-02-10 15:57:00 and then you have the guy we all hate and know
general 2021-02-10 15:57:22 nailed it
general 2021-02-10 15:57:54 i never watched a tutorial ever
general 2021-02-10 15:58:17 what is the point of watching a tutorial when we have brains to think of how to build?
general 2021-02-10 15:58:36 wow i have been online for 2 hours
general 2021-02-10 15:59:07 that was needed
general 2021-02-10 15:59:29 wow community back alive
general 2021-02-10 15:59:37 anyways, back to the topic
general 2021-02-10 15:59:55 tutorials are kinda useless after you learn from a friend
general 2021-02-10 16:00:29 after you join pcc and learn it from the others, you dont even need to look at a tutorial clickbait pic to build
general 2021-02-10 16:00:58 like just use your brain, its not hard to build something when you know how to build legos
general 2021-02-10 16:01:20 yeah
general 2021-02-10 16:01:37 even without motor lock, you can build something really good
general 2021-02-10 16:02:53 this is why we dont like tutorial users, not all but most of them just try to flex with the tutorial builds or claim it as theirs after adding 1 block and modding it
general 2021-02-10 16:03:17 thats what i see on normal non pvp servers
general 2021-02-10 16:03:41 kids just flexing their tutorial build then someone takes out something that looks good and they try to copy it
general 2021-02-10 16:04:17 wait is there an expert vip server?
general 2021-02-10 16:04:29 oh finally
general 2021-02-10 16:04:44 i dont have to look at shredders in normal vip
general 2021-02-10 16:05:01 most of them
general 2021-02-10 16:05:13 i still remember 2 guys that have shit builds ngl
general 2021-02-10 16:05:34 2 identical bombers and 1 with a shredder
general 2021-02-10 16:06:08 all of vulpens build i see in pvp (99% of all the time) i proceed to shoot them down
general 2021-02-10 16:06:37 i have a shredder killing toyota that helped me kill most of the shredders i encounter
general 2021-02-10 16:06:55 utterly disgusting
general 2021-02-10 16:07:24 if i see a shredder, i will take out my jet and proceed to wreck them
general 2021-02-10 16:07:36 no joke

general 2021-02-15 13:29:21 they say its like how the flame is blue when you fire up a new stove
general 2021-02-15 13:30:39 but i feel like its about the concentration of oxygen and fuel since flames at a stove turns blue when its on low heat.
general 2021-02-15 13:31:14 and how blowtorches turn blue when you open/close the oxygen valve

general 2021-02-22 18:24:38 Well me and a friend spent 3 hours trying to get 2 villagers back to base which was more than 1k blocks away. Was worth it tho
general 2021-02-22 23:01:27 Lol
general 2021-02-23 05:49:14 okay, so i have found a relatively annoying problem
general 2021-02-23 05:50:22 one time when me and some friends went to pvp, a player by the name of Tiger131gamer, was raging since we rekt him, then he proceeds to make a video saying we bullied him because we rekt him
general 2021-02-23 05:51:47 so after we found the vid, we hunted him down in every pc server he joined
general 2021-02-23 05:52:16 then we made him delete his channel out of fear
general 2021-02-23 05:52:18 no joke
general 2021-02-23 05:52:21 he was scare
general 2021-02-23 05:52:25 *scared
general 2021-02-23 05:53:50 and then now he made another channel idk what name, but he also has an alt account with a relatively inappropriate username and spammed hate comments on my youtube account since i did some vids for one of my friend so he could make a heli himself
general 2021-02-23 05:54:00 like
general 2021-02-23 05:54:06 my account is dead

general 2021-03-17 01:20:32 even if the wings are too small, if they flap it fast enough they will eventually gain lift, just like how missiles fly at high speeds cause they need that speed to gain lift with their tiny fins and it is supposed to be fast so it wont get shot down. just like the f14, if you fold the wings, you will stall faster as you slow down so they go fast to sustain lift

general 2021-03-19 01:21:30 obc trolled
general 2021-03-19 01:21:36 we were all fooled
general 2021-03-19 01:23:04 I never found any issues with mods here nor did they do anything wrong. You all were picked since they trust you so its never a problem with it comes to pcc mods.
general 2021-03-19 01:23:21 wat
general 2021-03-19 01:24:19 ok tbh i dont really care about it since we do a bit of trolling
general 2021-03-19 01:24:38 well behave well and mod wont do anything
general 2021-03-19 01:24:52 only thing that has bothered me somewhat
general 2021-03-19 01:25:55 is the fact that sometimes for me in the morning/afternoon, since the timezone is different and mods go to rest then some trolls come by and do a bunch of stuff and we cant really do anything to stop
general 2021-03-19 01:26:55 even if there is 1 mod thats a different timezone can assure that pcc is always secure with mods

general 2021-03-25 02:04:26 looks like a a350

general 2021-03-25 02:29:30 **might**
general 2021-03-25 02:29:34 it barely flies
general 2021-03-25 02:30:05 you need to fly at around 200 sps so you dont stall out
general 2021-03-25 02:31:01 let me try
general 2021-03-25 02:31:42 nope
general 2021-03-25 02:31:49 super rocket is too much
general 2021-03-25 02:32:11 jet engine is just perfect
general 2021-03-25 02:33:34 and if you stall out you cant even fly the plane anymore

general 2021-03-28 01:11:00 You mean 2 years time?
general 2021-03-28 16:21:00 Just idle your engine and dive
general 2021-03-28 16:21:26 U dont do that...
general 2021-03-28 16:21:41 Not efficient
general 2021-03-28 16:22:40 For example, when i got shot in my f82 twin mustang i go idle with my engines and dive towards friendly
general 2021-03-28 16:23:38 And as you idle your engine and no fuel is sent or used, the fire will put out itself sometimes
general 2021-03-28 16:23:51 This isnt <#495286269459300364>
general 2021-03-28 16:24:19 Know nothing about you

general 2021-03-28 16:24:38 **anyways**

general 2021-03-28 16:25:28 Hello
general 2021-03-28 16:26:17 Only sometimes
general 2021-03-28 16:26:41 Not all planes glide with flaps
general 2021-03-28 16:26:53 And also flaps make you slower
general 2021-03-28 16:27:14 It aint a good one either
general 2021-03-28 16:27:41 I rather dive, gain speed and rush back
general 2021-03-28 16:28:04 Get back as soon as posibble
general 2021-03-28 16:28:28 U fly faster and lose less speed

general 2021-03-28 16:32:53 For props you can fly longer
general 2021-03-28 16:33:14 But still need to rtb
general 2021-03-28 16:33:48 Its only the engine cover/cowling

general 2021-03-28 16:36:34 If you lose the elavator then its death unless you push your engines to the max and use flaps while diving

general 2021-04-09 13:29:53 well ok i guess
general 2021-04-09 13:30:10 kinda
general 2021-04-09 13:30:28 it can be a job or a hobby
general 2021-04-09 13:30:37 based on what he does
general 2021-04-09 13:31:00 that classifies as hobby
general 2021-04-09 13:31:31 you have to redo it 500 times if not done correctly for the job
general 2021-04-09 13:31:54 you finally back alive?
general 2021-04-09 13:32:34 i dont do any voice acting nor animating
general 2021-04-09 13:32:43 just coding
general 2021-04-09 13:33:12 freaking computer class teaches secret messages
general 2021-04-09 13:34:50 i'll just say im only good in aircraft physics and engineering
general 2021-04-09 13:35:14 aerodynamics and weight to power ratio
general 2021-04-09 13:35:28 it works like heli blades
general 2021-04-09 13:35:36 not air pushes them
general 2021-04-09 13:35:46 the props pull air as they spin
general 2021-04-09 13:36:03 yes
general 2021-04-09 13:36:15 there are push and pull aircrafts such as the do335
general 2021-04-09 13:36:27 or push only aircrafts like j21 or the xp55
general 2021-04-09 13:36:51 or the pull aircrafts like bf109,p51, spitfires and many others
general 2021-04-09 13:37:08 and then you have planes like the vb10
general 2021-04-09 13:37:33 the hell
general 2021-04-09 13:37:43 god not that
general 2021-04-09 13:37:46 ?
general 2021-04-09 13:38:34 its hard to manage but i think you either balance it or angle the blades differently
general 2021-04-09 13:39:24 just like early ww1 biplanes where they turn to the side because there aint enough wing surface to counter it
general 2021-04-09 13:40:18 if you want, i can show you another method to make props look like they spin fast
general 2021-04-09 13:40:52 no dont
general 2021-04-09 13:41:08 its gonna make it so you cant counter the torque
general 2021-04-09 13:41:33 actually, dont use prop blades cause they dont really do any good
general 2021-04-09 13:42:08 go pcc vip1

creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:09:36 dude really got mad since nams draken looks better <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:14:07 meanwhile your draken has no camo and with a square cockpit and a nose thats too big

its a skill issue that you cant fix, and the fact that you are saying that nams build isnt accurate meanwhile your draken has a plain livery

and if you say that you are gonna fix it, then its gonna be obivous you are gonna try and copy some of nams design after seeing the public opinion and not willing to accept it
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:16:48 i dont think he can even recreate the livery since nams livery took him a lot of time

and let me guess, in a few days or hours, hes gonna post it in creations and with all the designs from nams draken\
general 2021-04-18 04:20:40 dude got mad in <#504436696021204992>  after they said that someones elses build is better than his then proceeds to say that it aint realistic when his own build isnt as well
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:32:45 meanwhile your plane resembles a draken yet aint one since you have square cockpit which doesnt make sense

which makes it even more obivous that you are gonna do something that is either the same or based on it
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:35:32 and also if you want to keep crying like a baby thinking that your draken is better, then keep going since this is free entertaintment
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:52:37 yet you talk mad shit about someone elses build?
general 2021-04-20 05:29:09 to meet rickje

general 2021-04-20 05:32:31 nothing is happening
general 2021-04-20 05:32:35 whats the pic for?
general 2021-04-20 05:32:40 looks like a mat
general 2021-04-20 05:32:47 swedish mat
general 2021-04-20 05:33:09 idk
general 2021-04-20 05:33:15 doesnt work i guess
general 2021-04-20 05:33:32 perhaps
general 2021-04-20 05:33:47 nothing moving for me tho
general 2021-04-20 05:34:17 tbh idk what the purpose of the pic is
general 2021-04-20 05:34:40 just looks like a normal pic which looks like the swedish flag
general 2021-04-20 05:40:44 thats a gif

Yeah escalated quickly as you try to use someone elses creation to say your own heli is bad, 0 iq play right there

general 2021-04-21 07:37:51 Rewrite history
creations-chat 2021-04-21 07:40:42 99.99% of all swedish are cool and you are the exception which is that 0.01% that ruined it
creations-chat 2021-04-21 07:50:54 Meanwhile the only thing you are good at is cry after losing an arguement and using a bunch of unde explanations

The fact that you refused to admit that your building skills are garbage and yet you try to argue with people who are more skilled makes it so you look like a 8 year old trying to get attention from others
creations-chat 2021-04-21 07:53:55 You know, not that we are the best but our skills far out match yours and you try to use others builds which is a tutorial on yt. Dont act like a child getting attention and just get a hang on reality
creations-chat 2021-04-21 07:56:29 Arguement end, kid rekt. I see this as a win-win situation

general 2021-05-14 08:02:14 Sure, you wont be able to play wt anymore so go ahead
general 2021-05-14 08:02:54 Finally learnt the reality?
general 2021-05-14 08:03:32 Fix your pc before you speak
general 2021-05-14 08:13:55 it wont glitch out when you ram into something
general 2021-05-14 08:14:17 yeah try motor locking with motor 2, that will work
general 2021-05-14 08:14:33 Imao yeah
general 2021-05-14 08:17:36 i'd rather drop bombs if the accuracy is crap
general 2021-05-14 08:18:07 wdym i made a a10 that shoots tnt
general 2021-05-14 08:18:17 21
general 2021-05-14 08:18:23 i dont play much
general 2021-05-14 08:18:29 ok and?
general 2021-05-14 08:18:52 if your lvl is high but you, yourself is idiotic then it wont work
general 2021-05-14 08:19:12 good so anyways
general 2021-05-14 08:19:20 back to the topic
general 2021-05-14 08:19:31 tnt cannon from the skies
general 2021-05-14 08:19:56 i once killed an entire shredder swarm with 4 cannons
general 2021-05-14 08:20:04 on a plane
general 2021-05-14 08:20:24 pro
general 2021-05-14 08:20:32 big brain
general 2021-05-14 08:20:45 wdym hard just goddamn kill them
general 2021-05-14 08:21:07 when they are fast yes, but if they slower than a starter plane then easy kill
general 2021-05-14 08:21:20 then get something better
general 2021-05-14 08:21:38 you know some kids are so dumb they wont know
general 2021-05-14 08:22:14 ok mr "my cannon is the greatest" what else you want to boast about next?
general 2021-05-14 08:22:37 plane
general 2021-05-14 08:22:39 death
general 2021-05-14 08:23:03 i'd rather do mass scale carpet bombing instead
general 2021-05-14 08:23:55 imagine realistic missiles where they actually lock on to players <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2021-05-14 08:25:24 maybe
general 2021-05-14 08:25:30 but drones would be a pain
general 2021-05-14 08:25:55 cause some will just put their seat in water or float in space
general 2021-05-14 08:26:27 what if they put option for heat seeking or radar lock
general 2021-05-14 08:26:39 rockets wont kill players sadly
general 2021-05-14 08:26:53 unless its in private servers
general 2021-05-14 08:27:00 can you stop being cringe
general 2021-05-14 08:27:11 how about radar tracking
general 2021-05-14 08:27:26 just lock onto something that flies
general 2021-05-14 08:27:30 then boom kill
general 2021-05-14 08:27:45 but that would make pvp machines become op
general 2021-05-14 08:28:03 yeah
general 2021-05-14 08:28:25 but what if its a reward for login days?
general 2021-05-14 08:29:00 like if you have like 20 days in the counter and as a reward you get the missile
general 2021-05-14 08:29:21 yeah but at least it stops newbies spamming them
general 2021-05-14 08:29:32 mine has 50+ days logged in
general 2021-05-14 08:30:07 people would just use glitch engines at the point
general 2021-05-14 08:30:21 yeah
general 2021-05-14 08:30:39 conv doesnt count as an engine
general 2021-05-14 08:32:46 Thats called firework
general 2021-05-14 08:33:10 Some will pen
general 2021-05-14 08:34:20 So if we get smth like aam then it would be nice
general 2021-05-14 08:34:50 Launch tnt to tnt
general 2021-05-14 08:35:20 If you put the radius to max then the tnt armor would also die
general 2021-05-14 08:36:01 Yes
general 2021-05-14 08:36:48 If you blacklist and launch cutters then it will definately go through even tnt armor
general 2021-05-14 08:37:17 Ask the shredders about it wont u?
general 2021-05-14 08:37:48 But guns i think, are the best weapons for pen
general 2021-05-14 08:38:00 Cause guns go through things
general 2021-05-14 08:39:02 To counter tnt armor, just launch tnt at it
general 2021-05-14 08:39:15 With full radius
general 2021-05-14 08:39:35 Works as well
general 2021-05-14 08:42:15 Wat

general 2021-05-23 15:06:20 Wasnt there an incident where some guy lagged pcc vip?
general 2021-05-23 15:06:41 Idk like 4 months ago or smth
general 2021-05-23 15:06:50 I remember people complaining
general 2021-05-23 15:07:38 Mega
general 2021-05-23 15:07:45 U remember?
general 2021-05-23 15:08:28 Well idk what happened but at least vip is fine for now
general 2021-05-23 15:09:55 The last thing i remembered in vip is some dude was trying to pvp a friend and i joined to just shoot rockets at his shitty "bomber"
general 2021-05-23 15:10:07 And he got mad
general 2021-05-23 15:10:15 Then took out a shredder
general 2021-05-23 15:10:21 And still couldnt kill me
general 2021-05-23 15:10:32 Even when my pvp was on in vip
general 2021-05-23 15:12:51 Wdym, a simple truck with a turret at the back can just 1 shot it if you aim for the motors
general 2021-05-23 15:13:45 And i just remembered that it was someone with expert rank that lagged vip
general 2021-05-23 15:14:17 Swarm tnt cannon and they get wiped off the face of the earth
general 2021-05-23 15:14:52 I dont need tnt cannon
general 2021-05-23 15:15:11 Even so my plane can easily fly 1.5k sps
general 2021-05-23 15:15:22 And outrun them
general 2021-05-23 15:16:21 But the issue now is that they now build shredder balls
general 2021-05-23 15:16:59 Now its a ball of cutters with trails with on off engines
general 2021-05-23 15:17:52 Like u can easily fly faster but the fact that they instantly stop and fly with trails
general 2021-05-23 15:18:15 And muscle
general 2021-05-23 15:19:57 I always feel like i have a heart attack or stroke yet its just me getting chest pain

general 2021-06-21 05:34:31 ok then

general 2021-06-21 05:35:40 LMAO
general 2021-06-21 05:36:00 what if airliners had thrust vectoring
general 2021-06-21 05:36:20 why are the wings of airliners aimed upwards?
general 2021-06-21 05:36:41 why do airliners fly high above the clouds
general 2021-06-21 05:36:53 lo
general 2021-06-21 05:37:29 other important reasons
general 2021-06-21 05:40:35 they need clutch so they wont shred the gear, the differential is to make it so wheels can spin at different speeds, manual cars use a manual gera box with you need to shift. tires turn at different angles depending on the car itself, universal joints makes it so the shaft can turn at a different angle while spining at the same speed and reverse gear uses a different gear that allows the car to go backwards
general 2021-06-21 05:40:37 ez

general 2021-06-23 23:21:52 heres the point of a mod, even if they are late, they still do their job as in warning or even banning a rule breaker
general 2021-06-23 23:23:26 i think we really need like 1 really active person to be a mod
general 2021-06-23 23:24:00 i think i remember theres a vid of plane crazy in a nutshell
general 2021-06-23 23:27:04 no, its just toxicity at its finest

general 2021-06-23 23:41:16 its like lego
general 2021-06-23 23:42:03 german barrel fragile
general 2021-06-23 23:42:24 when you snipe a tiger II from 1.7km away
general 2021-06-23 23:43:16 the place where they load the shells
general 2021-06-23 23:43:30 its the actual gun itself
general 2021-06-23 23:44:49 its a standard for tanks i think
general 2021-06-23 23:46:36 magnet
general 2021-06-23 23:47:09 so the charge and the shell?
general 2021-06-23 23:47:55 so basically the shell stays while the actual bullet itself leaves the barrel?
general 2021-06-23 23:48:04 ah
general 2021-06-23 23:48:05 alright
general 2021-06-23 23:48:14 knowledge
general 2021-06-23 23:48:23 ejects the shell?
general 2021-06-23 23:48:32 dayum
general 2021-06-23 23:48:44 alright next up autoloader
general 2021-06-23 23:50:30 i found someone with a naval gun that reloads and fires like 5 rounds each gun
general 2021-06-23 23:53:47 I might just try
general 2021-06-23 23:55:25 wow rick
general 2021-06-23 23:55:36 rick did the funny
general 2021-06-23 23:55:51 i think he gone
general 2021-06-23 23:56:09 https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8dda86e1919ecefcda068c275d4c90ed
general 2021-06-23 23:57:21 
general 2021-06-23 23:57:27 aint it like that
general 2021-06-23 23:57:58 
general 2021-06-23 23:57:59 ?
general 2021-06-23 23:58:23 is this it?
general 2021-06-23 23:58:51 e
general 2021-06-23 23:59:07 
general 2021-06-23 23:59:37 this?
general 2021-06-23 23:59:37 
general 2021-06-24 00:00:04 looks like the weight of the shell pushes down onto the block
general 2021-06-24 00:00:27 why not pistons?
general 2021-06-24 00:02:05 
general 2021-06-24 00:02:35 thats cool ngl
general 2021-06-24 00:08:42 so basically, when a new shell is loaded, the breach gets pushed down, then the recoil does the work of ejecting the shell at the same time putting the breach to catch a tang so it wont move up, and when a new shell goes into the barrel, the tang moves forwards releasing the breach and allowing it to spring back up
general 2021-06-24 00:09:07 is that how its supposed to be?
general 2021-06-24 00:10:10 so basically the breach is always open
general 2021-06-24 00:10:20 well not always
general 2021-06-24 00:10:58 so when the shell goes in, it pushes a mechanism that releases the breach from the tang?
general 2021-06-24 00:11:11 bruh
general 2021-06-24 00:12:31 so the recoil is doing the job of making the breach catch the tang
general 2021-06-24 00:12:42 and at the same time ejecting the shell
general 2021-06-24 00:12:51 i guess its a hook of some sort
general 2021-06-24 00:13:21 well rocket engines here we go
general 2021-06-24 00:18:22 well its very complicated but if you find out how it works then its kinda easy

creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:24:33 Putting it there is just showing how much u support it and making people vomit on first sight.

The fact that you had the goddamn nerve to put it onto your sub makes it clear u are trying to show that you support it which means you **want** us to know
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:27:46 You want to show us that you support it, makes it obvious that you are finding trouble at the first place
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:29:48 Well then the fun ends here
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:31:50 Its a name not a fucking flag. Names exist for a fucking reason.

general 2021-06-29 04:52:58 hmm sounds like someone is mad about having skill issues
general 2021-06-29 04:54:01 imagine having to only pitch 20 degrees
general 2021-06-29 04:54:21 you having to see planes with cheese grater wings?
general 2021-06-29 04:54:57 cant do cobra
general 2021-06-29 04:55:00 with that
general 2021-06-29 04:55:13 its a lego game with little to no physics
general 2021-06-29 04:55:25 you gonna argue just because i downvoted?
general 2021-06-29 04:55:51 just because you cant accept that some people downvote?
general 2021-06-29 04:56:27 and yet here you are complaining
general 2021-06-29 04:56:59 im suprised you pinged me just because i downvoted?
general 2021-06-29 04:57:35 and i gave you an explaination?
general 2021-06-29 04:57:58 and yet you try to complain?
general 2021-06-29 04:58:11 im just here since you pinged me
general 2021-06-29 04:58:20 and gave you explaination
general 2021-06-29 04:58:43 then now you just try to use some useless insults using "imagine"

general 2021-06-29 05:01:10 then?
general 2021-06-29 05:01:43 u gonna argue that pvp planes cant do quick turns to counter pvp machines?
general 2021-06-29 05:02:12 its simply because its a lego game that has little to no physics
general 2021-06-29 05:02:45 thats true
general 2021-06-29 05:03:07 physics where shredders can fly which looks like a brick
general 2021-06-29 05:03:23 then shredder balls fly without wings
general 2021-06-29 05:03:52 wdym i have a plane that pulls like 50gs turning at 0.1 seconds to counter shredders
general 2021-06-29 05:11:30 is loki gone?
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:19:20 those are basically kids who think that motor locking engines into a build means that they are "pro" but in reality its just adding more weight

<@!546223347025969164> and also pcc build standards are higher since people build better
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:23:01 you are just basically saying that pcc standards are higher than before and you cant catch up or just accept that people now have higher standards

cause people troll here, you dont understand why still builds get more upvotes because they think its "funny"
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:26:29 tbh its just that people have higher standards.
well if you are not gonna say they should stop then let it be, why does votes matter to you when you know theres at least someone out there filled with envy or jealousy, straight up hate for something then downvotes just so they can annoy you
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:30:46 the internet is just a shithole if you didnt know at the first place

and you said you didnt care much so why ping us at the start? its just us having higher standards
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:33:58 i mean i gave you my explaination and you said you wanted to be "realistic" so why not just use that 1 bar of control surface if you want to be realistic
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:36:37 then all that you have said is just a joke considering that you can use a custom control surface which looks more accurate and clean compared to exposed control surfaces

and just make your life so much easier

i guess so nam
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:39:22 i mean it allows you to do a complete roll and goes much faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:39:36 idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:40:01 if you want to say more shit about custom control surfaces then its not really my problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:40:21 im just saying that you should cover up the control surface
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:40:34 then just accept it
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:40:54 then dont ping me just to argue
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:41:15 i gave you an explaination so just keep it as it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:41:39 so what? you really thought about that seriously?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:42:18 well might as well tell you that i dont really support custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:42:40 dude
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:42:41 just
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:43:02 fucking accept that people have higher standards so dont just go around saying shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:43:56 then im not about to fuck around trying to explain why some of us downvoted
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:44:17 then dont fucking ping me at the start
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:44:21 its that fucking simple
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:44:30 i gave you that so just fucking keep it
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:45:00 you pinged so i came
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:45:09 then you asked so i answered
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:45:32 then you arent satisfied with my answer so you drove this arguement into a shithole
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:46:09 then why the fuck did you just keep on going?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:46:25 
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:46:29 i wonder why
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 05:46:33 i wonder who

''we shouted down the----
jesus christ no one gives a fuck
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:28:01 ok so?
does it look like we care if you get warned or banned?
does it look like we even took your shit seriously?
do you think that your opinion matters anyways?

<@!707953054489509978> damn bro facts right there
"further proof" as in a bunch of words that doesnt matter at all?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:31:16 no one gives a shit about you, your existance nor about your opinion
for the sake of mankind, shut the fuck up trans furry
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:34:11 "disrupting" more like fueling it
<@!734608228192616572> holy shit bro, facts right there my man
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:36:16 jesus christ you started all this shit and now you are gonna whine about it?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:38:42 the fact that we dont give a fuck about your point nor your opinion cause he doesnt even matter at this point
if you are gonna try and "fight back",you may as well go jump off a building and society will be better
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:42:20 if the owner didnt care then why should you care? are you trying to be a "hero" or a "man of justice" and stand up just to start an arguement?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:49:19 a bunch of people liked it and we started to hate it, your point is just a joke considering that you think that you are right all this time but its just you in our own mind thinking that defending someone who obviously doesnt give a fuck about the votes makes you look like someone that is worth others "respect" but now you made yourself look like an idiotic kid losing an arguement, then now trying to "fight back" thinking us reply to that 1 message are basically a so called "trap", when its just you trying to save yourself which adds fuel to the already raging fire.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:51:29 you're done explaining shit to us when its just you having to more points to argue with

honestly your shits doesnt even make sense so all those typing is meaningless and so is your existance

After all that so why do we need you to ask?

(Maybe add it but its very hard to do so)
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:48:39 Try camera locking the trails for the rage effect
Since using half wedges dont really look good
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:51:54 If you want, i can help you with it since its actually quite simple. Just tell me if you need instructions or join a server to help you
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:54:38 Well i use camera locking with a lot of my builds i just didnt bother to post it here since people will either say "ItS a CoPY" or just legit copying it

creations-chat 2021-11-14 15:05:34 dont really need to worry about it tbh, its just people not liking it or trolling (your build is good enough by itself so i dont see why some will envy or troll)
creations-chat 2021-11-14 15:07:55 a meme build can get 100 upvotes instantly, i dont see how hard it is (well thats good to hear those shitty meme builds dont get ranks) (also cad i saw you with conv last time, good lord)
creations-chat 2021-11-14 15:10:25 if you want, i can dm you some color for the type 75, a japanese arty that looks similar to yours

general 2022-08-08 14:17:19 dont need to go into defcon 1 just for a bot raid

general 2022-08-23 12:43:13 there goes kids egos
general 2022-08-23 12:43:42 not even an update on pc2 development
general 2022-08-23 12:44:29 lmao
general 2022-08-23 12:48:48 god that fucker

general 2022-08-23 12:49:51 tell him i dont pc anymore
general 2022-08-23 12:50:05 fucking muppet
general 2022-08-23 12:50:52 make a 6 fold carrier
general 2022-08-23 12:51:03 complete with hull and proper scaling
creations-chat 2022-08-23 12:53:06 basic shit lmao
creations-chat 2022-08-23 12:55:41 still contemplating life choices to do it or not. Its a choice to either burn my braincells or preserve it for other things in life
creations-chat 2022-08-23 12:58:57 the more i stay here, the more braincells i lose to people arguing
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:17:31 oh cry baby try not to cry too hard with online disagreements
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:19:43 honestly they both need to stop being karens and bitching each other for a disagreement. Building a tank isnt so good and proudful, neither is using curse words a bad thing

and also, cursing is normal at this day and age, grow up
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:21:50 never knew you coped too hard until that point, i feel pity but at the same time i dont for your inability to accept critizism and just "blackmailing"sending screenshots of the word "fuck" isnt a comeback nor does it help you win an arguement. 

ah yes, i have a anime pfp, then what makes you good with "omg my tank needs to have upvotes and honestly 16 is anything to brag about
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:23:55 well i wonder who couldnt accept critizism and wouldnt move on then proceeds to "blackmail" using screenshots. Honestly its quite sad how this server came to be

damn a anime pfp can be sad when a kid argues for a point that doesnt even make him look better 🍿
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:26:12 now proceed to shit talk anime pfps when its 2022, people need to use dated comebacks tbh

exactly, salt is the best ingredient
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:28:37 now go on, shit more on anime pfps while moving your convo from not being able to cope with critizism and using blackmail

just remind you that yes, your build is still as shit
general 2022-08-23 13:29:40 another day of pcc arguements
general 2022-08-23 13:29:43 had my fill
general 2022-08-23 13:30:53 -arguements
-ego
-using outdated comebacks
-biased to their own builds and thinking they can be the best
general 2022-08-23 13:31:01 does that check out for you?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:31:07 jesus christ what the fuck is that
(that is a pvp build, and yes its 2 years old now)
looking back now holy shit its fucking bad
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:33:18 cant hurt much anyway ☕

(ey that side mg port looks good)
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:35:32 beating you at your own game i guess but i do admit this shit was damn crap from 1 and a half years ago
general 2022-08-23 13:36:22 i wonder who else is doing so with a based opinion as well
general 2022-08-23 13:36:29 without even saying anything
general 2022-08-23 13:36:42 sending gifs and that really it
general 2022-08-23 13:36:45 that you go again

general 2022-08-23 13:37:04 there
general 2022-08-23 13:37:16 i thought you wanted it?
general 2022-08-23 13:37:26 just playing his game
general 2022-08-23 13:37:34 what makes?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:39:17 cant say much when your builds are 10 months newer
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:41:36 8 months older, still better than yours and those arrows dont lie and also 4.7k blocks is weak
better not fuck with ogs

laughing out loud rn
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:43:40 actual facts
general 2022-08-23 13:44:14 i just love how creations chat is what i can describe as war zone
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:46:30 mine aint too shit after all eh?

speaking about my 1 year old plane with your 2 month old

(on gahd cad)
general 2022-08-23 13:48:28 they kill themselves
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:48:33 lmao my dude is blind af , ignores the bad and only thinks good of himself "oh wow i used edits to get more upvotes"
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:50:35 there he goes, no comeback and anime pfp insults. What a fucking joke when you have a hind pfp and russian words for status
(m8 from below, hes dead stop stabbing)
general 2022-08-23 13:53:09 legit just a meditation session
general 2022-08-23 13:53:29 and learning to deal with kids so when you have a kid, you know what to do
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:54:46 this fucker is 1 year 7 months old you shut the fuck up
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:57:16 bet you can fit an entire hind there (holy shit bixin you found the truth)
general 2022-08-23 13:58:48 i think imma go rest, learned ways to deal with 11 year olds
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:00:15 The front may need some change but overall i see this as a above avg build
Also ignore the fly in the room, just busing around
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:02:30 Anyways, any hopes left for pc2?
Also just ignore a user named 23443ht, hes irrelevant
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:04:43 As you can see, a 11 year old is currently buzzing around i dont know for how long but yes it is here. So just ignore the minor alright?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:06:46 It somehow is, and honestly im having fun ever since the og toxics were gone. A bit of learning on how to deal with ego children anyway

Did he just admit that he is the 11 year old being the minor?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:08:53 Good that my guy came out to admit that he was indeed the 11 year old therefore the minor in the group. Now as all teens or adults should, we ignore the minor
My general liking is different from yours, if you like something, dont force others to like the same nor critise others, unlike your dog ass thinking insulting a drawing would do a lot to improving your point
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:11:50 Implying that im an adult doesnt really change my opinion on what i like, now go marry your hind and later find out that you dont have the money to own one
Also how is an anime pfp irrelevant and how can a culture be "bad" in a sense or are you having kid issues with different cultures?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:13:58 Like i said, the word fuck isnt as bad nor does it even count and heavy swearing. You need to stop reusing comebacks.

Alright after that refreshment, any plans for new builds?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:16:14 You aint breaking the 4th wall and also stop being a karen not willing to accept cultures

You guys wanna move to general?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:20:02 He wont, so just let him cringe all himself and also do you want to move to general?
general 2022-08-23 14:21:23 Yeah ignoring the minor
general 2022-08-23 14:21:40 Who said we wanted to escape you lol
general 2022-08-23 14:21:50 Its better here with no cooldown to shit you faster

general 2022-08-30 15:09:36 Is this it?
general 2022-08-30 15:10:09 I mean i just showed you an artical so
general 2022-08-30 15:10:30 I mean tbh its the ottomans but turkey was the ottomens
general 2022-08-30 15:10:40 So thats up for debate
general 2022-08-30 15:12:13 Racism i guess
general 2022-08-30 15:13:24 Flop
general 2022-08-30 15:13:30 Give me context
general 2022-08-30 15:15:39 I dont know much about turkey but i love kebab
general 2022-08-30 15:15:51 Food is good
general 2022-08-30 15:15:56 Is really good
general 2022-08-30 15:19:56 Not to jump in on the arguemnt but just here to clearify, aint you also trying to be racist or try to look like you are the right one here?
general 2022-08-30 15:20:21 Good on you
general 2022-08-30 15:20:34 Welp that explains a lot
general 2022-08-30 15:21:02 Sir, your monkey is already an act of racism
general 2022-08-30 15:22:35 You called him a monkey when you have a "i feel like im better at everything" mc syndrome?
general 2022-08-30 15:23:35 And flop, the community itself is the one at fault so if someone gets expert rank just accept that the system is just utter shit
general 2022-08-30 15:23:57 From this i see a very much mc syndrome
general 2022-08-30 15:24:43 Uh im just here for facts not arguements
general 2022-08-30 15:25:01 Doesnt mean you have to take in the roast
general 2022-08-30 15:25:22 You said you didnt care but why bother?
general 2022-08-30 15:27:12 Its an issue whereby you are the one thinking all the critisms needs to be sent back but at the same time you show a supriority syndrome where you want to dominate the arguement but refuses to elaborate once you say something off
general 2022-08-30 15:27:56 Is alive yes
general 2022-08-30 15:28:19 Still not about your passion for your country
