creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:53:47 How do you make good quality guided missiles that are really small?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:54:49 I mean tiny. Small enough to fit inside a 3 wide, 3 tall, and 6 long missile bay
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:55:23 How big was the missile
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:55:58 Ok
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:56:40 I need something that can fit in a 3 wide, 3 tall, and 6 long missile bay, and can be mouse guided
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:58:21 I don't really want motorlocking, I have a potato pc that lags on minimum settings.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:59:40 I actually have a design that fits the criteria, but it doesn't work too well for me
creations-chat 2020-10-08 01:00:52 Does anyone think they can help me? I'm probably gonna be on in about 2 1/2 hours
creations-chat 2020-10-08 01:02:07 Nice

plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:31:15 i wanna talk to whoever had the idea to make an fps based physics system
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:31:19 i just wanna talk
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:36:42 dude
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:36:48 i can run the game just fine
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:36:56 but if i have any ping at all it just doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:37:00 or packet loss
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:37:47 everybody agrees that fps based physics are a horrible idea, ask just about any PC youtuber
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:38:02 that shouldnt have anything to do with the actual game physics
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:38:36 look at any other game out there
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:39:40 yes lol, thats what its called
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:42:47 thats what im talking about
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:43:08 they are essentially throttled by fps
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:43:47 when i turn my graphics all the way down the plane straight up handles differently than when graphics are up high
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:44:40 it would be much better to have the physics do their own thing instead of tethering
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:45:11 thats possible, but the physics are supposed to be server side
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:45:51 roblox is super confusing
plane-crazy 2022-06-28 07:48:43 pinnacle of game design üëç
