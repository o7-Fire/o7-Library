plane-crazy 2018-12-02 21:57:45 i went to mach 1100
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:03:48 
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:04:53 im at 120,000 now and the plane is like fusing to gether
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:04:55 together
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:05:27 
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:05:27 not gonna quit until i break the light barrier
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:07:31 the physical limits of the roblox player are broken
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:07:53 there's not really an intention to increase the limits or a reason to either
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:08:31 
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:08:39 what the fuck i've like fused into my seat
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:09:01 almost 1/10th the speed of light
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:09:15 wait
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:09:18 100th
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:09:22 god dammit
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:10:37 my rocket assisted balloon has began to collapse into itself once it hit 300,000
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:12:29 i think i broke the game speed record of that's a thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:12:42 i feel like my computer is going to die if i don't stop
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:14:52 rocket engines can be helpful
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:15:54 i want to jump from my balloon while going at 400,000 studs per second
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:15:57 but
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:16:14 i'm curious if i can break the light barrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 22:21:13 i swear the next person to ask about getting kicked is getting yeeted out of a helicopter
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:33:17 More or less finished my fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:02 It is, this is my first small aircraft though so I'm hoping to improve
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:06 And hey it works pretty well
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:45:20 speaking of swastikas
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:45:32 there's a dude who made a swastika in the server im in
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 03:49:05 do i have to report the dude making the swastika, in this server
general 2018-12-03 03:57:59 oof.
general 2018-12-03 03:59:20 Liberating Germany will have to wait for another day I guess
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 04:48:22 There's a dude who has been firing at my plane for the past 10 minutes waiting for me to exit build mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 04:49:28 that's one hell of a server
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 04:49:29 looks fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 04:50:55 lol i joined a server and there's a dude chanting the lyrics to hit or miss
creations-chat 2018-12-03 05:09:07 does chaining my plane to my base make me a plane abuser
general 2018-12-03 05:12:48 im abusing my plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:51:28 Motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:51:50 They let you rotate what's attached to them
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:45:44 I'm gonna attempt to get a Modeler role by making a Me-410
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:59:58 people who forget to delete blocks accidentally placed on the plot and end up launching them because of how poor their machine is get annoying
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:08:00 What's the best way to make good looking tank treads
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:42:02 Mosquito|mmm0|210 blocks|597 studs per second max speed|8 second turn time
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:53:07 M1 Blackout Ground Attack Bomber|699 parts|386 max speed|22 second turn speed
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:53:39 Hm
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:55:03 Who do I tag to request ranks?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:57:15 <@456226577798135808> 
requesting adempt and expert or advanced builder rank
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:58:05 h0t
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:00:32 Would a turret work on a plane
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:00:53 I'm planning on making a plane that'll have a few turrets
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:05 Neato
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:44 Yeah, no doubt. I just want to put a turret on a plane because I personally think it'd look cool.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:59 It'd be more of a plane to show off than to fight
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:03:39 I've got the design of my new plane kind of planned, it's gonna have a 40 degree rotating missile launcher under the pilot seat and two MG turrets on each side
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:03:44 Seems pretty neat
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:04:01 As said though, fighting with it isn't possible.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:06:40 1k is a pain to get to with out using lots of helium or making your plane uncontrollable
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:07:25 Most I've ever gotten was 400,000 SPS and I just spammed helium blocks and super rockets, Lmao
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:34:35 my mosquito can turn in a snap xd 

I want to make an Me-262 or Me-410 to get my first replicator rank
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:35:34 rocket assisted turning ftw
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:35:59 with out rocket assisted turning my planes would turn awfully
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:36:52 at the end of the week I want to start on a pretty complicated replica of a B-52
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:36:58 Or I may wait until bombs are possibly added
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:18 i don't trust downward rockets
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:27 last time i tried i ended up rolling into my rocket
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:56 for my fighter to hit anything with rockets I have to use weird tactics such as using rear facing rockets and fly ahead of the target
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:38:30 that's bulky
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:39:41 this game has no armor to begin with lol
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:40:02 the armor is literally probably plastic
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:41:02 sounds more like APHE than HEAT
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:41:23 APHE fires an explosive into a tank, HEAT has no explosive filler
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:07 the name HEAT is very misleading tbh
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:54 the shell doesn't use explosives to penetrate tank armor, it uses explosives to melt metals that are fired into the armor in a narrow stream to penetrate tank amror
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:55 armor
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:43:06 yes
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:44:05 they are
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:44:36 if they were HEAT they would lightly damage an outside block and tear up inner blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:44:45 my bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:44:56 kk now i'm in the right channnel
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:46:33 > when 12 year olds think they're funny with dumb edgy jokes
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:46:55 xd
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:47:04 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:47:59 default it's g
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:48:20 it only works outside of build mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:48:42 cursed
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:49:48 im debating whether or not I should extend this to make it look better and less compact
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:50:56 1x1 woul generate minimal amounts of thrust xd
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:50:59 would
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:54:13 ROBLOX doesn't really have a reason to add better physics, it'd benefit a minority of games while the big popular games would hardly have any changes and the popular games are what make ROBLOX money so they don't really have a point to.
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:54:34 As much as I'd love for better physics to be a thing it's unlikely that it'll happen.
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:55:08 what wingy thingies
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:55:11 winglets?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:55:38 flaps?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:55:53 dm
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:56:08 that's gay fam
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:56:12 and against the rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:56:34 > saying fap is breaking rule 2 about nsfw content
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:56:56 oh wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:56:57 tail
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:57:14 im confused
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:57:15 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 00:57:22 what part are you talking about and where exactly is it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:00:06 you set a hotkey to use them with
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:06:56 Finally made my plane a little less compact, I've got to centralize the lift now though
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:08:27 It's not unstable surprisingly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:08:39 It flies pretty well which shocks me
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:10:56 Oh wow that's a really good plane.
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:11:22 Is it a MiG-29?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:11:38 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:12:31 I'll upvote it once I get my plane finished
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:12:34 Right now that'll be soon
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:16:31 neato, flies much better than the previous model
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:18:44 Very well
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:18:57 I may not even need the rocket assisted turning anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:19:06 the short variant was plagued with turning issues
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:19:16 So I put the rockets on it and turned it into the god of turning
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:31:01 
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:45:51 T3 Mosquito Model II|mmm0|345 parts|422 max speed with 3 different engine sets to allow for easier targeting when facing targets of varying speeds|oh also functioning turret
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:50:34 oh, also varying angle rocket launchers for fighting chasing targets or targets that are ahead
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:10:26 Do I need to record myself doing stunts for the stunt roles
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:10:43 I can probably already get ace pilot with one of my fighters
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:12:35 having magnets affect other players would be laggy and abused
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:12:57 imagine getting your plane just like sucked out of the sky at 600 SPS strait into a giant magnet
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:24:38 ace pilot trial

went 510 SPS in a vertical climb
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:24:38 for over 10 seconds
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:25:28 who do I talk to to get ace pilot role
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:25:47 i have a video file of me going in a vertical climb at 510 SPS for over 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:05 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:15 Does Gyazo allow for 10 seconds gifs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:59 xd shame
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:28:34 i can't name how many times i see the vtol
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:28:46 i've shot down a ton in the pvp server xd
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:31:22 <@!295568493166985218>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:31:54 h0t thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:32:38 i find the smaller planes to be a pain to target but that's probably because I make my planes too fast
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:32:59 i have to make variable thrust sections to manage to fire at smaller targets
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:33:13 I have my thrust in 3 groups
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:33:57 the most annoying players in the game are the ones who make giant turrets and just shoot at everything
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:34:19 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:34:33 Only thing I say is reasonable to ram is the turrets
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:34:53 It's like a weighted block
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:37:07 my only massively popular suggestion was one i ripped off of From the Depths which was mirror build oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:37:27 i might try to make a ship sooner or later
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:38:19 Jameson forgot to punctuate, what a shame!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:38:39 I'd make a sub if I could make torpedoes
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:39:30 i don't think i ever punctuate unless i'm writing long paragraphs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:41:08 sure i'll write like an idiot online but when i have a 1,000 word oklahoma history essay my grammar goes from idiot to  scholar, Lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:48:14 can i have orbital velocity xd
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:49:29 this is from yesterday but can i have orbital velocity
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:50:02 wing
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:50:26 it doesn't have to be exact
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:50:34 it just has to be recognizable as the plane you're making
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:56:18 i'm not a dev so i've got no room to be saying anything about it but finding more experienced devs to help out with the game could help a bit.
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:57:04 rick is god
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:57:59 im attempting to get the escape velocity rank and for some reason, going super fast slows down my internet
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:59:38 i'm gonna leave my computer on over night and see if i break the light barrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:02:03 
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:03:11 jfc
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:03:21 Literally the majority of the contest submissions are all Ospreys
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:03:41 True
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:04:04 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:04:12 I don't exactly 100% understand what you mean by that
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:05:46 i mean once I watch the VTOL tutorial and figure out how to make a VTOL I probably could. 

Unless you mean a real life VTOL model
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:06:40 If you mean like a real VTOL mode, hell no I'd be stuck because Osprey is literally the only mass produced VTOL purpose built aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:07:17 (F-35 and other fighters can VTOL take off but they can't do it well, they just have it as an option so I'm not counting them)
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:08:38 F-35 is overrated xd
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:08:45 F-22 > F-35
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:10:13 F-14 was probably the most capable fighter tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:10:42 It could spread it's wings out to generate more drag which made it slower and much better at ground attack
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:11:07 While other fighters had a split second to attack ground targets, the F-14 could slow itself down a lot to have a wide opening to attack ground targets
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:22:40 broke escape velocity
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:31:35 this gets me all the girls

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:39:09 i have a player to report for making swastikas in the game again
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:39:32 
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:40:40 i am the honorary swastireporter who reports the swastikas to mods
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:41:06 sad
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:41:21 i'll just spawn kill the swasticopter
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:42:59 trapdoors aren't gay, even though they're traps, traps are gay if they're not wearing socks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:04:04 OwO
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:44:15 Is is possible to attach a plane able to fly to another vehicle as a sort of secondary vehicle that can take off?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:44:29 I want to make a land carrier to get a higher rank for building.
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:46:12 I have 44 mbs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:46:36 your provider is god
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:47:44 im not sure if you need any ranks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:48:02 i saw a few people with pretty much 0-2
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:51:27 this will be a pain to configure
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:51:41 it's spinning due to thrust inbalance
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:52:06 The outside is the issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:07:56 You don't even need too many to go really fast :v
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:08:02 Depending on the weight
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:08:27 Sad, did all of the roles lose their colors

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 14:22:58 Fear
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 14:31:24 I won't like it unless wings extend
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 14:31:30 Do the wings extend
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 14:31:32 Oh

plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:45:28 I applied for moderator and it's probably gonna be rejected when they read "Homestuck rp"
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:46:06 It's cancer

plane-crazy 2018-12-26 01:25:53 Tbh Plane Crazy is like BYM but better.
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 01:26:08 Has BYM even been truly open in over a year.
