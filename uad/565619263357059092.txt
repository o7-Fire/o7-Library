bug-reports 2022-04-07 17:55:59 I have infinite beams
bug-reports 2022-04-07 23:23:19 for some reason it duplicates things in the build menu sometimes (old photo) Very rare bug i'm pretty sure.

bug-reports 2022-04-07 23:24:44 It's only happened to me twice in my 1 1/2 years of playing

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 03:20:53 ohhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 03:21:07 I thought you meant one on the opposite side
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 03:26:39 I just added 4 more ballast blocks and the plane is simply just uncontrollable.

plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:22:40 I  just calculated mach 10 is sps
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:22:57 15600
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:23:43 15600 sps is almost exactly Mach 10
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:24:37 it goes into the 100,000th of decimals
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:25:29 this is the Mach number of 15600 sps: 10.00562
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 05:17:33 Apparently this is one of the top results for when you search "Soyuz FG" (Bottom picture is an actual Soyuz FG for reference) Man I just wanted to build a rocket <:Sad_Texan:851297901376438292>
