creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:59:27 <@!683847069890510887> its supposed to be grey with yellow and black stripes, but the scaling of the build did not agree with the idea i had in my head. and i just got lazy and neglected to paint some parts.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:01:02 i couldnt make any other shades of yellow, it just turned white when i tried to change it.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:02:07 someone should make the hindenberg
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:03:39 i remember i made a crappy mig-25 foxbat once.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:09:50 <@!479305807674998804> wh...why the hell is there a suspension in the intakes!?!?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:10:59 oh
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:12:35 thats why i have a variant of mine with an experimental warpdrive so i can just yeet behind them and then the hunter will be the hunted\

general 2020-12-02 14:08:08 will they be redoing the winter event for this winter?
creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:10:03 what do you guys think of my razorcrest?
creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:17:31 i can also do motorlock without tutorial. its called doing it repeatedly until it works.
creations-chat 2020-12-04 03:35:11 sweet! my razorcrest got 10 upvotes. thats most i have ever gotten.
help 2020-12-04 19:02:07 anybody know of a good method of control for a behemoth?(3000+ parts). I'm trying make my razor crest flyable. it controls fine when I'm in hover mode, but it wont be controllable in air.
help 2020-12-04 19:04:17 i alredy have plenty rockets. enough to the point where i cant fit more.
help 2020-12-04 19:05:33 if it is too heavy then it wont be able to take off, and the landing gear might break it it gets too heavy.
help 2020-12-04 19:06:13 i have stuffed them in every unused part of the ship.
help 2020-12-04 19:07:07 just for reference, heres what im working with.
help 2020-12-04 19:07:15 
help 2020-12-04 19:07:22 
help 2020-12-04 19:07:30 hmm
help 2020-12-04 20:49:32 hmm. sadly the razor crest didn't see an improvement of in-flight performance. i may have to invest in a gravity slider.
creations-chat 2020-12-05 20:58:58 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-12-05 21:13:54 Should i utilize the cargo bay on my razorcrest with some bombs?
creations-chat 2020-12-06 01:01:21 i am was already working on making the carbonite chamber , but there has been a slight delay in that because i am trying to make it actualy look like a block of carbonite.
bot-central 2020-12-10 02:15:24 &suggest bigger ocean with realistic water physics(builds filling up with water and sinking, etc...)? also forest biome with trees?(trees should be breakable with enough force, and trees should damage builds if crashed into)
bot-central 2020-12-10 02:15:28 crap
bot-central 2020-12-10 02:15:30 didnt work
general 2020-12-16 20:39:23 BRUH

general 2021-04-01 10:21:43 what does gold even do?
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:46:51 bruh
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:48:54 why everyone downvote my ship
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:54:59 i couldnt remember the paint off the top of my head, and i dont like doing excessively large builds(unless it is a dedicated project). the jump ship was just something i deecided to randomely build
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:58:47 it did bother me that i couldnt add those, cuz it wouldve screwed with the balance of the ship.
creations-chat 2021-08-25 02:55:45 <@!464634048279478282> extra points on the mario for that buttery smooth movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 20:09:38 bridge concept idea for my next space ship. Good or bad?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 14:02:18 0-0
