creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:45:09 I'm not sure if this has been done before but I used motors to make a War Thunder style mouse aim plane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVxlDuvrV-U&feature=youtu.be
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:45:48 Works much better than the regular mouse aim + it's op as all heck
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:46:03 Still working on making the roll mouse aim, for now it's manual
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:54:59 Works good in third person just hold down right click
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:58:17 Thanks, anyone is free to try it out it's stupid simple
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:58:23 If you have any problems with it just dm me

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:17:40 Yeah I feel like one now lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:18:22 My mouse is 8 years old
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:18:51 Oh god
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:19:43 I fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:20:11 Logic
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:20:46 I just bought a game cube controller that works for PC wirelessly
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:20:52 And the battery lasts for 50 hours
bot-central 2019-12-13 14:21:22 That means I was at least born in 2016
bot-central 2019-12-13 14:21:24 xD
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:23:02 I'm 3 years old apparently
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:23:14 I did the  m a t h s
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:23:58 I hate it when people mention that I use "xD" literally everyone did it now all the sudden no one is doing it
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:24:03 Starting to piss me off
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:24:21 Explain to me what is wrong with "xD"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:26:02 After doing an interwebs I found that nothing is wrong with using "xD" so leave me alone god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:26:37 I've used it for years
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:26:55 I do "xD" because that is how they did it back in my day
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:27:04 XD is for children
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:27:07 xD is for men
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:27:12 Big difference
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:27:19 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:27:26 I know I was joking
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:28:01 I just prefer "xD" over "XD" just as I say "C'ya" instead of "cya"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:28:15 Both are grammatically incorrect
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:28:21 So you can use them however you want
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:28:37 C'ya
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:29:01 Plane cray'Z
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:29:05 xD
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:29:22 What are you even saying man
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:30:32 If you do " C' " then it sections off the C in a way that forces you to say "C"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:31:06 "C'ya" the C is sectioned off from the rest of the word but is still part of it
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:31:09 It's nice and compact
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:31:23 Otherwise I would just do "C ya"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:31:53 Who?
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:32:34 Why is it that I always end up having to explain myself whenever talking to people online
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:32:54 I should just commit die
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:34:53 Ok... boomber.

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:44:00 You dodged a bullet by putting that "o"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:44:36 You don't want to put a lone "n" on discord servers now adays
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:44:52 A lot can happen in a short amount of time
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:45:31 Ok I actually can't figure out how to get into Dev mode
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 14:45:41 Setting positions changed
