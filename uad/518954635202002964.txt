bug-reports 2021-06-10 23:46:28 The game isnt lagging or not working in any other way, I just can't use or move any buttons on screen. Trapdoors work and you can build the same.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 00:11:35 thanks
bug-reports 2021-06-11 01:14:37 thanks, i cant even move by build
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:39:51 No, it's not harsh, people will always downvote, so telling someone not to post is the only way of avoiding downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:42:24 I see, but the chances are people will downvote.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:44:37 It doesn't really matter, even hall of fame builds have downvotes - it's unavoidable.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:03:22 impossible, people love to shit on other people's lives
bug-reports 2021-06-29 22:58:39 Hmm...
general 2021-06-30 22:55:47 Lol
bug-reports 2021-06-30 23:55:59 That happens when you save a build during the loading process, because not all blocks are loaded. When did you save your creation?
bug-reports 2021-07-05 18:16:18 if you type 'filler' behind emojis and such they dont tag. Like '0 filler'. If the text size is set to 100 the word 'filler' dissapears
bug-reports 2021-07-08 13:46:45 I'm not sure, but the text needs to be big enough that the word 'filler' disappears. It only works for SOME emojis, but it's still very useful.
bug-reports 2021-07-08 13:47:19 It does, but only with SOME emojis. What problem did you have?
bug-reports 2021-07-08 23:13:31 Nice, I'm building a hotel with a giant pool. I don't think there is any way to make a noclip-able pool without blue emojis that fill the entire text box space.

creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:01:09 <@719168864705052802> The railings are the only fault but the rest is almost 100% block for block. Most diesel locomotives are bland. I have very little space to fix the railings and the severity of my brain aneurysm would skyrocket. The loco already has so much motorlock
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:18:00 I'll try improving the bogies. Thanks!

plane-crazy 2021-12-23 21:31:44 very
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:42:20 I did omit some details, like the cab railings and bogies, but all in all it is spot on. The CN on the front is pretty much impossible for my skill level. Looking at pictures and 3d models, the loco is about 85% accurate imo.
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:44:32 I do play on mobile, I just cropped the pictures to hide the controls and GUI
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:46:33 To fix the "lack of details" I would have to scale the locomotive up immensely. The only issue I have with it is that it is a bit too short by a few blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:56:03 <@719168864705052802> if I make a consolatory caboose would you upvote
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:58:08 it's not harassment, we are just trying to figure out why hars has a 99% downvote rate
creations-chat 2021-12-23 22:00:09 yeeah...once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and third is a system
creations-chat 2021-12-23 22:02:26 yeah that's long gone by now lol

i am going to join vip1 and fix the "lack of details"
creations-chat 2021-12-23 22:09:07 you can use either springs of disconnectors, springs are not left in the build when toggled, but they tend to get stuck in the build sometimes
creations-chat 2021-12-23 22:33:56 I would variate the green and use a darker green altogether for more realism. Also a darker brown for the trunk, try color code 25.
creations-chat 2021-12-24 00:16:11 ooh yes, but I would lighten the darker patches
creations-chat 2021-12-24 00:18:12 just subtract 10 or 15 from the base green
