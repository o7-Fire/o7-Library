creations-chat 2023-04-06 23:06:20 i used an ai to give me livery heres what i got:
Stealthy Sleekness: The livery should reflect the stealthy nature of a 5th generation fighter jet, with a sleek and futuristic design. The base color could be a matte black or dark gray, with angular lines and sharp edges to give it a modern and aggressive look.
High-Tech Accents: Add high-tech accents in a contrasting color, such as metallic silver or electric blue, to highlight the advanced technology of the fighter jet. These accents could be in the form of sharp lines, geometric patterns, or futuristic symbols that evoke a sense of cutting-edge technology.
Military Insignia: Incorporate military insignia or emblems to represent the country or squadron to which the fighter jet belongs. These could be placed on the tail, wings, or fuselage, and can add a sense of pride and identity to the livery.
Customizable Panels: Consider adding customizable panels on the fighter jet's exterior that can display digital patterns or graphics, which can be changed based on mission requirements or pilot preference. This could allow for dynamic and personalized livery designs that can be updated as needed.
Dynamic Contrasts: Incorporate dynamic contrasts, such as gradient color schemes or contrasting patterns that create a sense of motion and speed. This could be achieved through the use of bold colors, dynamic lines, or abstract designs that evoke a sense of energy and power.
Futuristic Typography: Consider using futuristic typography for the fighter jet's name or callsign, which can be placed on the fuselage or wings. This could be a bold, futuristic font that complements the overall livery design and adds a touch of modernity.
Glossy Finishes: Add glossy finishes or reflective coatings to certain areas of the livery, such as the cockpit canopy or wingtips, to create a sense of depth and enhance the overall visual impact of the design.

creations-chat 2023-04-29 20:48:56 add different colors to ur livery like maybe green, dark green, tan, dark tan also the red dots look dookie, also motor lock control surfaces into ur wings other than custom control panels
color codes incase ur bad at using rgb: 
green: 60 66 60
tan: 145 125 105
light green: 70 77 70
light grey for belly: 110 110 110

creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:54:59 unless your build is 9/10 level then the only feedback ur gonna get is delete it i recommend taking it to another server like floaty box or someone small bc they less toxic (but also by a small yt group there prob not gonna have good builders but floaty box discord server is actually good)

A couple years ago I had a dog named casey who was around 17-18 years old (rlly old) and one day while we were feeding him he wasnt eating and wasnt moving so we packed him into the car and drove to the vet (the vet is 1 hour away bc I live in te middle of no where) and when we get there the vet tells us that he has a tumor on his lung and he will need to either go through surgery or be put down, well we chose put down bc even if the surgery worked he woukd be in a lot of pain so it rlly shows how in the blink of an eye your life can change
