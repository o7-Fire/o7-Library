The Tale of mr.sauce_boss (482976955202011156)
help 2019-08-22 14:45:51 K so lemme just explain what happend a minute ago.
So Im buissy this whole week building  A warship. well today someone came to my plot wonderd arround a bit and got to his own plot ( i thought he was just seeying my ship) WELL apparently he made pics and is trying to copy the WHOLE THING like fr hes doing the exact method of building I used. i blacklisted and then Anti Copy blacklisted him but it was too late, sadly i can't remember the name but it enden with Dino (something close) and had a red lizard skin (you know those'' cute '' lizard skins you find) and yeah i would like to report him for copying, and btw i sadly have no proof since he blacklisted me and anti copy blacklisted me so i have no chance to proof it and he left the game... so yeah, if you don't believ me fine you have reasons too but im 101% serious about this and its a common problem that should be fixed, thnx for reading and hope you have a normal, nice day

general 2020-05-22 16:42:54 Hey,  me and some friend of mine are trying to make a shortfilm and we are running low on people. So i need everyone that is interested, patient enough (cause this isnt going to be finished in a few days.) And have decent building skills (meaning any rank from IV and up are welcome). 
We just need people to build vehicles that will be used in the final film.

Dm me if you're interested and i'll give more detailed info.

general 2020-05-22 16:43:50 Nah
general 2020-05-22 16:44:55 ^^
general 2020-05-22 16:45:02 Alright
general 2020-05-22 16:45:34 We mostly need 80's cold war soviet tanks and nato tanks aswell

general 2020-05-22 16:47:51 We mostly need things to be.. well realistic. So actual working weapons arent really needed.
general 2020-05-22 16:48:36 Also, we *kinda* have an idea what we're going for but we're far from done sure what we'll fimm exactly
general 2020-05-22 16:49:42 We dont need any drones, cameras or ppl with screen recorder. Thats already been taken care of by me
general 2020-05-22 16:50:03 Its situated in 1988. Just saying

general 2020-07-13 22:31:20 Look, just because some guys dislike it (even without real good reason because yes) you Shouldn't really be personally offended by their critisism and delete it. Try to remake the wing a little and it'll look alot bettr.
general 2020-07-13 22:33:02 Well, reshaping the wing isnt gonna cost 300 blocks i think
general 2020-07-13 22:35:11 Try to give the creationg some time to get voted on
general 2020-07-13 22:36:06 The proportions of the wings in general are wrong
general 2020-07-13 22:37:40 Search for a verification bot and try to find the commands for it
