the-dump 2022-03-27 19:24:41 
the-dump 2022-03-27 19:24:57 not a piston
the-dump 2022-03-27 19:24:58 but suspension
the-dump 2022-03-27 19:25:03 powered by a rotating thing
the-dump 2022-03-27 19:25:07 pushes it back, and releases
the-dump 2022-03-27 19:25:27 im gonna build it in a lego game, not selling it to militaries

general 2022-06-19 15:08:25 plane crazy 2 when
general 2022-06-19 15:08:59 plane crazy two when
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:27:54 pc2 when
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:28:00 its literally the middle of summer
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:28:06 and the release date is summer
general 2022-07-09 14:28:35 pc 2 when, its summer
general 2022-07-09 14:28:54 no
general 2022-07-09 14:29:13 racism
general 2022-07-09 14:29:31 even more racism
general 2022-07-09 14:30:23 if i make
general 2022-07-09 14:30:26 a turret right
general 2022-07-09 14:30:34 that moves one piece very fast without it disconnecting
general 2022-07-09 14:30:39 and put a rocket on that part
general 2022-07-09 14:30:49 and then shoot the rocket whilst the part is moving at like 500 sps
general 2022-07-09 14:30:53 will the rocket move at 650 sps
general 2022-07-09 14:31:03 since a rockets speed is velocity + 150
general 2022-07-09 14:31:11 so i can make like hypersonic missles
general 2022-07-09 14:31:51 i prefer toddles
general 2022-07-09 14:31:59 theyre much heavier so they have a higher impact force
general 2022-07-09 14:32:06 toddles
general 2022-07-09 14:32:16 toddles
general 2022-07-09 14:32:36 ðŸ¤¨
general 2022-07-09 14:33:15 idk how
general 2022-07-09 14:33:20 but i managed to make a rocket spin
general 2022-07-09 14:33:21 BUT
general 2022-07-09 14:33:21 right
general 2022-07-09 14:33:23 when i fire it
general 2022-07-09 14:33:29 it teleports far away and comes towards me
general 2022-07-09 14:33:41 die
general 2022-07-09 14:33:43 will pc have like
general 2022-07-09 14:33:46 more weapons
