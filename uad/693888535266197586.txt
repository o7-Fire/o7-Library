plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:23:49 and i walked to the end of the base
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:25:24 
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:25:38 i would show it in the air
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:25:49 but i would lose control
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:26:36 <@!251880826386513924>

plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:28:37 a little yellow tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:29:01 so apperently the legs
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:29:07 are important
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:29:12 when flying
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:32:22 basically in order to take off u need the legs to rotate to the front
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:33:00 but hey and passed the goals make it walk and make it fly
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:37:49 <@!251880826386513924> i got a pic

plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:38:19 its fast
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:38:47 but when the legs fold in
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:38:52 its fast
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 01:39:14 it goes nuts when i have it a full blast
