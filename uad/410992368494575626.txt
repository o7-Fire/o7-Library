plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:17 Kudos is basically just saying "I respect what you've done" and giving praise while doing so
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:42 also, I barely noticed those ranks, huh. Do the builds have to be replicas? (and np)

plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:42:38 <@428948212225933312> you could try to increase the length of the nose :-) it doesn't look too bad as of now though. And maybe some custom motorized panel controls.
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:48:08 <@428948212225933312> I see a lot of improvements that could be done do it, but it isn't necessarily too much. I'd be glad to help with it later on

creations-chat 2020-05-20 18:39:36 Sad cuz I cannot figure out how to share this video clip of a jet with Vector Thrusting
creations-chat 2020-05-20 18:55:25 Oop figured it out
creations-chat 2020-05-20 18:55:30 Thx tho for the suggestion
creations-chat 2020-05-20 18:59:36 Hm, mind if I get a frontal pic?
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:01:15 You could use some wedges on the wing edges to smooth them out, and try to motorize the surface panels for better control
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:01:22 Other than that pretty nice man
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:02:21 You could, if I'm looking right
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:02:42 Ahh so it's one of those wings
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:03:45 Hmm are those blocks on the tip half blocks?
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:04:32 Alr, I got an idea but I'll try to screenshot it instead
creations-chat 2020-05-20 19:10:32 ack, I wanted to upload it but for some reason stuffs acting funny again

creations-chat 2020-05-21 03:49:25 <@446205377604878336> thanks for telling me that then :-/ I don't play ace combat so I didn't realize it looked like that
creations-chat 2020-06-07 09:50:14 <@446205377604878336> they're supposed to represent thrust guidance vanes, but ok then lol. Also you're that same guy from last time, hm?
creations-chat 2020-06-07 10:32:36 <@495822777224396811> dunno why though, looks pretty damn good to me

creations-chat 2020-06-07 12:49:13 Lol, you and the word honest? You just seem pretentious and rude to me. Personally, I don't know how the hell you'd help anyone out with that attitude.
creations-chat 2020-06-07 13:00:31 <@456226577798135808> go for it, if you have the space and time that could be a fun project

creations-chat 2020-06-10 21:19:28 ^ hello man :)

plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:27 Look at my original creation! It looks so much better than anything you guys could make XDxD hahahaha
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:30 
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:54 I godamn hate that raptor with a passion
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:31 It literally consumes me with nothing but pure and sheer RAGE to see that ugly mess of assorted wasted space fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:51 Go for it bro
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:03 Motorized/custom panels are always way more effective at turning and tend to look better if you want that smooth surface look
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:16 You may have to use key controls for em tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:24:32 Hm you got a point. Also I like mouse control for PvP, it helps me adjust my shot before I fire, otherwise I hate it
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:25:59 Hybrid is good, but it tends to look ugly for planes in this game
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:26:05 Me no liek holz
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:26:50 Pretty damn good! The railing looks pretty nice.
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:27:34 Also about the cockpit, there's no way to truly make it circular so just make it look as circular as possible
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:28:44 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:29:42 Someone should post a tutorial Raptor in creations for downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:30:00 Cuz it's funny lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:30:19 Aight prolly later on
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:31:13 Funny thing is, this is my alt, but I guess on here it's my main. Also yeah pretty circular

creations-chat 2020-06-19 01:21:57 I think that's a dark souls armor set at least. Idk maybe I'm tripping

creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:21:16 Your builds are kinda boxy and not necessarily original or creative
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:21:31 Hi
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:21:50 Yup! I added you back
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:22:10 Pretty great, hbu?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:22:33 Funny how the guy above is mad bc people disliked his build
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:22:44 He's probably just taking it out on everyone else
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:23:12 His insults also are weird and don't make any real sense tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:23:24 I'm having a stroke trying to comprehend them
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:23:50 Lol, ironic how you say ugly when your stuff is getting downvoted
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:24:22 Tbh it kinda doesn't matter if they like it or not, if you like it then that's all that really matters
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:24:58 But if you're going to be mad for people not liking a boxy and commonly seen car, then ... I'm sure someone will use that for entertainment
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:27:22 <@615584805085773864> lol, btw it's weird you also call people uncreative when the AE86 Mk2 is a pop culture icon across the car community that's literally known by any person who works a car
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:30:03 Talk about the free entertainment you get from witnessing a salty player

creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:45:21 Oh yeah did that guy named maniacobros get banned finally?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:46:05 That guy was so damn rude. He got one of the creations I was most proud of downvoted and basically tried to take the credit away for something that I made with my own head
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:47:19 Oh yeah he was talking about how the HOF builds suck to him
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:47:52 Ikr? He was even more toxic than this other player called Deciduus
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:48:49 Aight to general we go
general 2020-08-07 03:50:28 Basically though, maniacobros kinda would just dislike everyone's stuff and hate on the majority of anyone's builds, even the HOF stuff while bragging about how he's superior at the game just because he used to play on simple planes (and even that didn't help him get good at plane crazy.)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:05:03 Seems like Baba's stuff was still getting flamed lmao

creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:46:12 <@389516889501728779> just because an aircraft looks similar to something you've seen, doesn't mean you need to discredit others works. The only similarities I see are basically the airframes setup.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:47:58 Thanks you a lot. Sorry if i seem a little mad at you though. Sucks to literally design something by hand in a book then get your stuff discredited
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:49:42 Eh, I can see where you come from. The airframe set up is very similar, then again most aerodynamically effective setups tend to be similar in design
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:50:39 I doubt that, they probably look better than you say hah
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:50:59 That's not too bad, better than most I usually see on pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:52:18 My pvp planes are slower than they should be due to simspeed from having a 14 year old pc, they fly so much quicker on other pcs
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:53:01 Mine have to go at least 550+
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:53:16 Naturally without any conveyor engines
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:53:20 Yupp
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:54:10 I like em more because it seems hover drives are limited on bigger builds,  they seem more stable though
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:55:35 Yeah, microjets when done well are pretty much the rulers of the sky, even being better than shredders
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:56:38 Same, I may not be as fast as I should be but all my jets have an insane yaw turn radius
creations-chat 2020-09-13 05:56:55 That's a nice video to see

creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:49:27 Dude, I helped him with it. I coulda said that better but his intents were different than mine. He wanted an 8 bladed engine. He didn't want a  turbine.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:50:52 Lol how did I copy when I started off with this?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:50:56 
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:52:12 This, is what I started with compared to haemen. That's my idea. Its the same basis to make a turbine engine just entirely separate methods. My turbine ain't a copy.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:52:38 :-/
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:57:25 Actually, hell dude I started off this this really. I wanted to make a turbine to detail a aircraft engine I had.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:57:53 I made that up there for this, but wanted a more realistic turbine and finally got what I wanted after experimenting.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:58:43 I also wanted mine to provide slight thrust and work. I hate copying, and personally idk why you like to discredit ideas. Its kind of trashy, but go off
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:59:37 Haemen happened to HAVE a turbine that was more developed at the time coincidentally
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:01:10 I didn't even know about that tbh. I dont look that far back, but I just wanted something to compliment another creation i had
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:17:46 <@495822777224396811> aye btw, thank you for the partial assistance with design, gotta admit you create some awesome things man
creations-chat 2020-09-20 02:57:20 <@628523381209169930> cool  lol
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:25:53 <@441939688018935818> yeah, you're right :). Its a jet engine, but I wanted it to look dystopian. I took a buncha planes I liked irl, and fused em into that, then decided to give it a dystopia touch.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:27:43 <@441939688018935818> eh that's cool, taste is subjective. I like it which is all that matters in the end

creations-chat 2020-10-22 22:14:55 <@429826358827417601>  that particular LERX is made to retract the higher your AOA becomes to counter that, and the cockpit shape was made more pointy out of an attempt to reduce overall RCS by some slight amount, as the original cockpit was rounder which contributes to a higher RCS, bud. The intakes are based on ferri intakes, found on a variety of planes from the F-105 Thudchief to the Mirage 3.

help 2020-11-27 22:27:14 <@486276884611465256> you can construct a windtunnel from  straws, a bottle, and a simple fan. 

You store a piece of dry ice into a half open bottle with the drinking/pouring facet connected to the various straw holes, making sure that the nozzle going from the bottle to the various straw holes is somewhat airtight. The fan sits behind the dry ice as it lays in the bottle, and blows the nitrogen gas through the nozzle, and into the straws as individual streams. 

It's best to make your aircraft body using a 3D printer, but if you're old fashioned and somewhat artsy, use molding clay and create the body from scratch. You could even go as far to create your own RC model w/the same body, but the programming for that annoys most people. 

After you have the body constructed, you can mount it on a tri axial moving stand to test its fluid dynamics from multiple points :) 

(Theres other ways too but this is usually my way, and various softwares as well)
help 2020-11-27 22:28:27 Btw modeling clay is somewhat cheap but is harder for most to shape, the programs for this are easiest to use in all honestly. However, I like to see things in action so I'm weird
help 2020-11-27 22:48:22 <@486276884611465256> Yup, I test a lot of ingame designs that I've based on personal concept sketches irl with small body models. It helps me in other areas because I engineer/invent various mechanical and electronic things

creations-chat 2020-11-30 20:31:08 That thrust vector is actually extremely impressive
creations-chat 2020-11-30 20:36:05 I've seen and have made some thrust vector engines ingame too, just never as compact as that. Even the base of your rocket looks good.

And yeah agreed, but for me I compress too many rockets in a single spot, which means my simspeed slows down w/thrust vector

creations-chat 2020-12-11 20:32:16 I originally thought about it, but then I just got discouraged for various reasons. Primarily due to my experience with the first time trying that.. Then I kinda realized that I don't really have to, although it's a fun idea.

plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:18:25 Unstable, yes but that doesn't matter with fly by wire softwares. The issue is that at certain speeds above mach .8, that wing shape begins to contort. Meaning its structurally unstable.
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:19:00 Same issue with the su47. Hence the reason why they tried using composites to compensate for that, however that was an issue due to cost.

creations-chat 2020-12-13 22:15:25 It actually looks fairly good, especially with its given scale. The only thing I'd say to do is (if possible) increase how round the nose and window is if you can make a curve, which would help it a lot more

creations-chat 2020-12-14 12:25:20 Looks pretty cool, I like it a lot actually (especially the front lights/frontal bar). It'd look a lot better if it had some more laminar curves applied to it though, especially in the front where the hood is, and the top where the sirens seem to be. (If possible) try to incorporate some form of wedges to get that shape so it's more laminar.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 22:52:47 Thanks! I could tone down on the frontal detail a little or possibly change its scheme, but yeah ill keep that in mind. I appreciate the feedback :)
creations-chat 2020-12-14 22:59:10 Propeller may be nice, and in this case I could technically get away with saying it's a turboprop... thanks for that suggestion!
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:57:12 I mean, no? I just wanted a biplane that used a turbojet to function. Plus, after looking into the aircraft, it looks way different so this comment seems aimless
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:59:59 Lol, at least it got the point through as to some inspirations. Still seems pointless and very different considering the two ramjets are on the bottom of the wings and the overall shape is different.
creations-chat 2020-12-15 00:02:26 Thanks! Also it's just a jet engine, I wanted a dystopian look. But I might as well put a prop on it and excuse it as a turboprop craft. (and thank you Dood, although it's fine. I like it though so that's sorta what matters to me)

But yes Rav, basically that except make it fade to a different color shade that's based on the green in your plane mixed with a brown hue (weathered shading is also just making the object given look like it's been used and lightly worn)

creations-chat 2021-02-23 17:14:03 Lmao, I don't make things to please any of you, I do it for myself. I ain't changing something I added on purpose that I like. I always see you on here trying to gatekeep, and you ain't got the skill to back it up. Seems like the only option, is to go off on you considering you've done nothing but be an annoyance. Big difference between advice and being incompetent.
creations-chat 2021-02-23 17:19:35 Lmao, you act like my eyes aren't capable of observing trends. You shouldn't respond at all if you don't want a response back quite simply. Idek what argument you're referencing to, just seems like you gatekeep for wtv reason considering the advice you give isn't even helpful, just personal bias to your own preference
creations-chat 2021-02-23 17:34:40 Ironic given you coulda just let me enjoy my own creation without having to hear from you to change something I obviously added simply because I like it. I'm not having someone tell me to change something I added on purpose simply because I liked it myself. I started my insults, because unfortunately for you everyone has different opinions and responses. Mines a result of being annoyed at you for repeatedly seeing this gatekeeping tendancy. Not much you can do to make me NOT think a lot of your given "advice" is based on personal bias.
creations-chat 2021-02-23 18:03:25 I'm just gonna say ifit's something that isn't helpful to me, you, or really anyone else to change, then no.
creations-chat 2021-02-23 18:05:26 <@746383586755870821> 

While I could have taken a different approach myself, I'm just going by what I've seen most in this chat. I'm just tired of seeing new people mowed down, and I may have unfairly threw you in that group since I decided to react harshly and not think ahead. So apologies for that, but I can say there's differences in the way we both go about things. I guess a good way to sum this up is that the best intentions can bring the silliest mistakes. While I may not say much, I wish the best of people. It's nice to see someone enjoy their stuff they created, sucks to see them down when someone gives them unfair critique.

Deepest apologies, I'm quite sorry for my sudden harshness. You actually seem pretty cool man.

creations-chat 2021-02-23 18:53:08 Hm, yikes. I wonder if he was better over a voice chat compared to normal discord chats. Seems to be the case with a lot of people on discord usually.
general 2021-02-23 18:57:24 <@572411935669354528> yeah, makes sense. I'm gonna use general for what it was made for lol, but it kinda seems like a lot of people who were " experienced " that have left seemed to sorta have the same trends to their dissaperace.

general 2021-02-23 19:03:33 Ah. Yeah seems like most people are introduced through someone else. Kinda reminds me of the way I got introduced on here
general 2021-02-23 19:10:13 Oh yeah. I forgot about those till you brought em up again. I was introduced to plane crazy by my little siblings, they wanted me to build stuff for them on it. I liked it, and started to play for other reasons besides that. Btw, got any idea as to why he just stopped developing them?
general 2021-02-23 19:15:18 The lore goes deep into the universe of innovation inc. it seems. I was asking bc I see madattak on sometimes, but it's usually when rick is on. Sorta wholesome

plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:10:33 here ya go :) 

 (Sorry for the paragraph) 

You can get a plastic bottle, and cut off the back end of it. Next get some straws, and wrap them together. You take the straws, and have them facing vertically to the poruing hole at the top of the bottle, make sure the straws fill the entire bottle to the point where they have an opening to allow air to pass through, but tight enough to stay in the bottle. You take a second plastic bottle, and cut the back half of it open also. Take the poruing hole from this bottle, and connect it to the secondary bottle using some form of ducttape, line the ducttape with a calk sealant so it's mostly airtight. 

Take dry ice, and put it in the back of the bottle connected to the one with the straws. Place a fan behind the dry ice as it's in the bottle, so it blows the air through the first bottle, leading into the straws. The result will end with the nitrogen gas blowing in streamlined air, allowing you to see the fluidity of the simulated subsonic air on the surface area of your given object. 

Note: make sure to place small strips of tape with paper hanging off the end, on your object being tested, make sure they're fairly thin. Erratic movement of a strip means a disruption of airflow,  strips on the surface area should be moving very straightforward.

Side note 2: This allows you to see things in person like how the drag coefficient would affect the airframe of so said given aircraft in person. It's also a good opportunity to have some basis of what the drag coefficient is under simulated subsonic conditions at a low altitude. In my case, a clay model object moving around 331 mph an altitude of 2.3k feet. So while this is more suited for a car, same practice applies for aircrafts.

creations-chat 2021-05-11 04:54:51 If you're talking about the drawing, seems fairly different but I can understand. Designs for similar purposes unintentionally bring up similar traits.

creations-chat 2021-05-11 05:00:28 I.. don't see how you're making sense personally, but I'll try to see it from your view. Although I could explain the multiple differences here between this aircraft, and the two you listed fairly easy that make it vastly different :)
creations-chat 2021-05-11 05:11:16 I mean, sure. I'll take that as .. some form of feedback nonetheless, but I can genuinely still explain the differences that would highly suggest otherwise if you'd like. Your choice :). Thank you for the input
creations-chat 2021-05-11 05:22:17 It's an interesting viewpoint. I can see where he comes from with it though, to some lesser extent.
creations-chat 2021-05-11 05:30:34 Would you like me to drop the answer here or elsewhere? It's quite a long explanation.
help 2021-05-11 05:33:40 <@456226577798135808> here's your answer. 


The main differences for this and the F22, or the Su-57 are pretty evident. A wider surface area with engines that are close together to centralize it's thrust, that also use IR shielding methods to reduce it's heat signature, mainly by also pushing the engine deeper within the body do that the exhaust trail and it's heat signature is more absored by the nozzle. The nozzles and their structure in terms of functionality also are different from either one of those aircrafts, mechanically speaking. That, and it uses a variable geometric V-tail "ruddervon" configuration to reduce drag, and still give it characteristics of both a flying wing (when lowered) and a more conventional fighter aircrafts level of controllability (when raised to 45° to have control over both yaw and pitch). The surface area of the ruddervons and the primary roll wing are significantly wider than the Su-57 or the F-22, while having an even larger leading edge root extension. The reason why it may not look like that, is simply the size of the nose and main fuelsage being big enough to accommodate a larger radar platform, and a higher carrying capacity.  Now, the frontal canard is very similar in function to the Su-57's, but even that canard has a (lightly) higher sweep than the Su-57's. The cockpit also offers higher visibility, and it's shape is designed in mind with enough volume and visibility to accommodate a pilot and the WSO, while still having a decent enough profile that allows for a lightly lower drag coefficient. (when flying straight and horizontally.) The cockpit and it's design was inspired from single seated F-16 variants, as it's cockpit offers high visibility and a low drag coefficient. But was made to accommodate two pilots. :)
help 2021-05-11 05:34:40 Theres some other things, but that's pretty much it man
help 2021-05-11 05:36:35 Oh its totally fine! I get it, but I assumed you wanted details 😄
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:03:50 Holy shit. I don't have much else to say other than genuinely thank you and that I hope ya enjoyed it. Wow. Highly appreciated, truly :)
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:14:01 8 hours total across the 3 days to make the base frame, 4 hours on another day to tweak certain locks, and (while you may not like the paint) 1-2 hours for that.

general 2021-05-13 09:20:31 I don't really know who you are, but it's unfortunate you have to act like your opinion is better than everyone else's. Which, in my book, isn't the sign of a good person. I'm not saying you aren't capable of being better than you are currently, but that's petty. It's a game, after all. But, your choice and decisions man. Thanks for the feedback.
general 2021-05-13 09:24:52 I understand why, but at this point I wish people would acknowledge that this entire game is LITERALLY a cradle of people's dreams, whether they look stupid to you or not. I mean, if you don't enjoy it, someone else will. I'm not a big fan of criticizing when it isn't needed, but I am not a big fan of someone who is pretentious over something so .. unusual. If you're going to at least talk about me or someone else, call me or them out. But yeah, have a nice one man. 

<@177743269105500160>
general 2021-05-13 09:30:34 Are you good as a general and genuine question? I mean seriously, what happened for you to be so rude like this? Most of us here have went through some unfair treatment in this server for some stupid reason, so tell me what's up man? Hell, I'm serious. Gimme a dm sometime. You seem interesting
general 2021-05-13 09:35:31 Ya gonna respond or say something? It's not like I'm trying to be rude, I'd just like a genuine answer man. You're better than that, come on.
general 2021-05-13 09:37:03 I was just trying to figure out why you'd have to be so rude for no real reason. As a real question. You can look above to see what else I said if need be
general 2021-05-13 09:39:34 I.. don't think I really care about that. I just .. kinda play to enjoy the game because I like it, and it has sentiment to me. That's ALL it should be about. I get to play with things I don't have the money to invent irl, because I haven't YET reached that status. It's not about HOF, I just want to show people that they're more capable than they understand, and that they shouldn't base their intelligence on a silly game.
general 2021-05-13 09:40:08 And sure, I get annoyed occasionally but I'm just a person man.
general 2021-05-13 09:42:21 I doubt that. You're probably a nice guy to talk to irl. It just seems like you're rude in the server, because that's what happened to you when you first came on, just like it happened to me. And I get how annoying that can be, but as a genuine note you ARE better than that, now try to act like it. If you have some skill, go help the people who are new and encourage them to do better. I'm not trying to sit on a high horse, I'm just saying
general 2021-05-13 09:42:37 Why does it matter what VIP general thinks when I play to enjoy the game?
general 2021-05-13 09:51:18 You wouldn't need to brag about that if you weren't insecure about what you wish you had, or you're insecure about securing what you have. Then again, idk irl but you shouldn't let random opinions online get to you. They don't know you man, hell like I said I don't
general 2021-05-13 09:52:10 I don't hate the guy, i really just want to have a genuine talk with him tbh
general 2021-05-13 09:58:02 Listen, you didn't have to nor did you deserve it. Sure it made you better, but it made you more defensive because you got tested and treated like shit. And I'm sorry for that man. But still, just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else wouldn't. I legit don't hate you, and I can see you have great potential and a good imagination. I'm just trying to understand you so I can have a better approach as to how to talk to you on a genuine level.
general 2021-05-13 10:01:01 I've been writing essays man, it's kinda already noticeable.
general 2021-05-13 10:05:46 Good point, although can't hurt here at this point. What's someone gonna do, make fun of me for being literate and descriptive?
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:36:54 I can smell a coup de tat happening
creations-chat 2021-05-13 21:14:07 Kinda seems like the same cycle. You have a series of really good builders, who were once more so comparable to the general populus of PCC. Then they get insulted and bullied online despite having high skill builds, feel bad about it for a long time, and as they watch the server repeat the same cycle, they become apart of it because they just don't care anymore. Saying things they don't really MEAN to say, but what they've heard from others who treated them like that.

help 2021-05-23 08:06:55 So, any tips for creating a car ingame?
help 2021-05-23 08:24:21 2x2 wheels. I’m not trying to replicate internal functions accurately, in this case mostly just looks
help 2021-05-23 08:29:51 Yep, custom. It’s a concept car with a lot of 80’s-90’s looking features, I was hoping I’d be able to replicate it ingame
help 2021-05-23 08:35:37 Yup! The thing is, it’s not a necessarily complete one, but it has the dimensions on the back and the view sketches of it’s reverse view on another paper. I draw a lot of concept cars too, it’s just I’ve never attempted to make one ingame

creations-chat 2021-05-25 00:27:34 Criticism poo here
creations-chat 2021-05-25 02:19:08 Creations feedback being Garbo at giving actually decent feedback 

example 1,276,273,384
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:18:24 Jesus what the... like I get it, it’s a Warthog, the most over made vehicle in this damn game but what did his do to deserve THAT? It wasn’t even remotely close to the worst Warthog I’ve seen ..
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:20:48 Like damn, there’s NO way in hell that Warthog was THAT bad now. That’s an unfortunately impressive amount of toxicity
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:23:01 Did he add that AFTER or before him getting downvoted to hell?
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:25:04 Ohh. Nvm then, I guess technically that isn’t as bad, but damn nonetheless
creations-chat 2021-05-26 06:50:28 Wish the community was like this more often, especially here
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:37:51 Beautiful plane man. Like the little touch you decided to give with the anhedral primary wings & dihedral canards, camo looks pretty good too. Keep it up and enjoy your creations more!
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:40:48 Show me when ya can, it’s nice to see your custom creations more often : )
creations-chat 2021-05-29 23:31:43 This side of the sever is literally the equivalent of a ghetto in the middle of Detroit
creations-chat 2021-05-31 16:31:37 Appreciated feedback, thank you. 🙂 And yeah, paints not for everyone. Then again it’s usually made to just look nice to me. But there’s plenty of various German WW2 prototypes with highly slanted delta wings.

creations-chat 2021-06-01 15:38:33 Sorry I received this late. I was asleep then. I understand why you’d think so. But why not give it flying circus colors when the premise of plane crazy creations is in the name of the game itself? And, these schemes are something I’ll never see at my line of work again unfortunately. Plus, I like it, hah. It’s just a game after all. 

Ty for the very important feedback nonetheless. : ) Appreciated!
creations-chat 2021-06-01 16:08:52 Thank you a lot. I genuinely appreciate hearing this especially. : ) Although I will acknowledge that the paint jobs  are pretty damn crazy, which is intended. Lol
creations-chat 2021-06-01 17:24:20 Lmao that’s actually one of the few decent looking Starship rockets I’ve truly see on here, nice. I’d suggest making it a metallic color imo so it looks like it more
creations-chat 2021-06-01 17:28:51 Nice. Yeah I definitely liked it nonetheless. Does the body also use rotating motor locks or nah?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 17:34:54 Thank you again for actually replying with helpful feedback! And sure, I guess that may be true for some but from what I understand, that’s not the case for most, nor do I necessarily play the game to appease to others. Ya know? But  what would be considered OG in my case when everything I’ve made so far is custom?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 17:59:23 Lmao, it’s concerning you guys take usernames so seriously sometimes given I literally have the intentionally worst name in this server
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:01:25 Ahh gotcha. Maybe he could possibly be an “unde” then lmao

creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:47:23 This guy is literally being put on a PCC death row trial at this point lmao
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:16:00 Damn. That X02 was really good too. I don’t get why people downvoted it just bc of the pride month message, but ig also giving anything a pride themed color scheme can sorta ruin the creation since it’s never executed well
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:20:13 Eh, put it however it is I don’t think being kind is “cringey”. Just seems like people here respond with terrible attitudes because they were insulted themselves when they first got here, and find any kind responses or statements alien since they never got anything that was genuinely nice
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:25:59 Because I like it and find brighter schemes nice in this game, the literal premise of the game itself is in the name, and these kinds of flying circus color schemes are something I’ll never see at my line of work ever. Considering it’s just a game I play for fun, why do I have to appease to you? 
I’m sorry, but I don’t value your opinion more than anyone else’s around here.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:29:54 Aye thanks fr btw man : )
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:35:33 I also want to say this, I’m going to acknowledge that there’s a select amount of people who will never like my paint schemes, and I’m totally okay with that. It’s not like don’t make my stuff for me to enjoy anyways. But from what I understand, a lot actually do seem to like it because it’s genuinely unique and colorful. Truth is, you don’t speak for everyone and I will never view your opinion higher than someone else’s just because you’re picky. It’s a game man.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:41:07 Doesn’t seem like it and your demeanor tends to come off just a  hostile occasionally. Not always, just sometimes. I mean it’s hard to tell sarcastic comments online always, and most people from what I’ve seen most people can’t initially. It’s cool for you to have your opinion. And I do appreciate your feedback nonetheless, but all I’m saying is that I don’t think I really need to appease to anyone.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:03:06 I swear to god, I feel like a majority of what was just talked about was instantly forgotten and now we have another argument on the same basis as before just with different people. Talk about a never ending cycle
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:05:09 Also I don’t mind Pride things or wtv, I just hate it when people brag about being gay. But I don’t think that person was, they were just being genuine to me. Oh well though, red arrows don’t hurt anyone truthfully. But over representation can feel forced so I see what you mean by that.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:08:08 True true. But you also have to admit, some of the stuff said to people who create simple little builds like that can be almost (maybe to me) just a teensy bit excessively hateful
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:10:18 Also yes, I think you have the right to share your opinion when you want. Anyone does. I just think other people can possibly assume that you think your opinion is valued by everyone else more than theirs is, and maybe that’s the conflicting standpoint. But idk man, this part of the server is kind of just a neverending cycle of needless petty arguments and honestly petty insults most often unfortunately.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:15:58 Yeah I notice that. I think it’s genuinely kinda unfair when you get shit on like that honestly. But on another side of the spectrum I also think it’s unfair to some when you occasionally fail to acknowledge that it’s your own personal view and opinion, and that it doesn’t mean it’s everyone else’s. I mean I know you can’t always do so since most likely you aren’t thinking about doing that l. But that is my view on this. Possibly maybe that’ll help reduce the harsh reactions you get? No clue.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:25:57 True. There’s also just a long history with people who literally downvote for no reason, and maybe you’re getting thrown into that pile because that’s what most here associate that with. I mean it doesn’t seem like you’re inherently bad or annoying. Opinionated at most (nothing wrong with that) but a good guy to talk to nonetheless. Although, there is one thing I think most people would agree with. That the amount of harshness aimed at a pixilated creation online isn’t needed like it happens here constantly, for wtv reason

creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:06:23 This part of the server being shitty literally every time I decide to look at it. Godamn bruh y’all take shit too seriously here, like why
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:08:40 It’s fuckin nuts though sometimes. Like you have people tweakin out just because of an exposed motor, or some paint they don’t like, or some other BS when this game isn’t even intended to be serious

creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:08:34 What’s up with harassing this guy for him not wanting to share the missile design? I get that he sorta came off as being a braggart above just a little, but he’s not entitled to design or show you anything. Kinda just seems like he wants to play for himself and his friends... just saying. If you could explain what everyone’s upset about above, that’d be nice.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:13:32 Ah. Yeah I get that. Maybe they also thought you were bragging above too, but it’s wtv. I will admit man, nice work on figuring that out! Seems pretty impressive. I don’t understand the ingame physics behind it tracking,  but that’s pretty damn useful.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:18:24 I mean, when you actually ask nicer and try to not force anything from someone, that kinda makes a person more willing to share things in general. Just sayin. <:ElonMenacing:715271505088479537>
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:21:44 While I also hate to say this- unfortunately (and fortunately) now that there’s many people who know that this exists: 

There will also be very persistent people who will also get ahold of so said “secret” and it most likely will come out eventually. I just hope the guy actually gets credit for his design at least
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:45:56 Oh boy...
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:49:00 Idek tbh, nor do I care, but this seems excessive and a lil unfair. Like maybe the reason he isn’t sharing it is because it feels ridiculously forced and he’s not entitled to?
creations-chat 2021-06-07 03:00:48 Ya that was kinda a lame and rude move, but I mean ya gotta admit, dudes just getting harassed for not sharing something <:m_:778994206948589638>

creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:15:44 Then Correction: 8 four bladed props
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:18:45 So yes, that’s more like 4 layers and those are 8 “stacks” of 4 bladed props. You can also use disconnectors and springs to delay the locks, just be careful with springs. Because if there’s too many, they can literally just fling you to god if you unlock/activate them before the locked/powered motors have time to set

At least, they fling me
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:22:04 Unfortunately, I only got 20 motors left on that lmao. Also thanks herr : ) appreciated gesture fr man
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:35:00 Just saying, on that build in particular I only have 20 motors left 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2021-06-08 02:00:43 Heh, thank you man! Appreciated bro : )
creations-chat 2021-06-08 02:57:20 Sure! Can’t hurt to try both lol. I think I’ll probably design one but it may be more unorthodox. If I would make a passenger plane, I’d try to design it as a jointed wing passenger jet. May look fairly interesting

And I’ve made helicopters too, just very little amounts

creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:02:04 Really? Hm. Maybe it’s just in my head or something, bc it coulda been another person, but it’s unlikely considering the name sounds so familiar. Ik some people have gotten mad at me for making round things in game lol
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:05:46 Ikr? You can build great things without motor lock and all especially, but it annoys the hell out me when the unmotorlocked build they have isn’t even anything necessarily that noticeable imo. Like holy shit I understand the envy, but I wish those kinds of people would at least ask if they wanna learn so bad
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:10:00 Lmao really? I’ve seen (not a lot) but quite a few people claim that motorlocking is like hacking and then state it ruins the game

creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:21:20 Ikr? Its probably because all the people who normally chat have been banned or left
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:24:35 Hmm. I definitely wouldn't say most of them gave good feedback. A lot of it seemed needless, and usually they wouldn't actually take the time to truly help them. From what I've seen, it's usually a cycle of people acting rude to one another because they got treated like that lol

They doin it oh lawd
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:28:28 Like they would have given good feedback if they approached the person they were "criticizing" (more like insulting tbh) without calling them things like shit or making fun of them despite being new, y'know?

I think pcc is getting better, but slowly 

Very painfully slow
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:34:03 Probably because someone they looked up to and wanted to learn from told them off rudely and insulted their creation despite asking for help. I mean, I got told off rudely in my beginnings on plane crazy so many times when I wanted help. I feel like that's said because they want to- or know they'll prove them wrong eventually

creations-chat 2021-11-09 17:21:55 Looks real good to me man. Fuelsage is a teensy bit too thin, but it's not noticeable unless pointed out and tbh it's probably the best you could currently do (not necessarily because of a "skill issue", just because of the way the fuelsage is structured) but yeah man, I really like it.

general 2021-11-11 20:50:06 Its not too bad, but it is annoying. 
I m trying to do is figure out if I can replace this old ECU in it with one from a newer model, just so I can take the newer model ECU and give it a wilk racing chip (bc the older model ecu is kinda just.. not upgradeable..?) But weirdly there's no forums on this I can find

creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:30:57 Lol, dude its absolutely amazing. Truth is with the way PCC is, you're always going to have that 1 person or those few particular people who have something absolutely insignificant or just plain rude to describe the way they feel about your build. Basically, the majority of the users who use this daily will always have some form of "critique" and honestly its not really critique, just rude rambling.

Personally I think it's a 10/10 and I hope you had a fun time building it :) looks awesome. Post it!
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:33:54 Hope to see more of your stuff man. Seriously! And thanks :) genuinely appreciated. Best wishes to your future creations.
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:52:44 Pretty much all creations chat is at this point is practically an excuse for people who got stomped all over when they first got on, then became really good and got dubbed as "PrOs" to shit on other newbies and make them go through what they did :-/

Or it's just personal issues that end up influencing them to be an ass here since this is probably an outlet for frustration for some.
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:07:11 From what I saw, not really imo. Most of that critique given is more opinionated and based on their own personal preference.
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:16:10 Lol, then they try to justify their toxicity and make it seem like it's actually useful critique instead of personal preference.
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:31:17 Lol, you realize people have a life outside of this server and aren't always going to spend their time on it, right? I don't know you nor do I plan to meet you. First time I've ever seen your username. Truth is im going to forget about your existence as soon as this is over at the end of the day until you decide to ping me again. 

The times when I have come in here though, I've certainly "complained" about this when it is happening. At least you understand this channel is shit.
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:37:39 Lol, I'm saying most of it is. To me it kind of is considering there's no real reason to take plane crazy as seriously as you, or most other people on here do. Also in all honesty, I've seen plenty of extremely extremely similar hulls to his made by other "pro" players and nobody says a word. I think it's fine, but it still seems less like critique and more like personal preference given that all this "critique" is extremely inconsistent with one another coupled with the fact I've seen many amazing ships with hulls in that style that aren't critiqued.

creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:39:40 Thanks man! Also no worries you'll definitely get better the more you play. Your creations don't seem too bad at all man! 

 Since I noticed you said you struggled with some detail occasionally, try adding the stuff you'd think would be the most insignificant. The tiniest details help the whole build look more "real" and as a result, better. Like canopy framing or wing air control surfaces that are seamless
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:43:12 Np man. Best wishes to your future creations :)

It's nice to see it clean, repainted some of the faded yellow speedometer markers too
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 19:46:31 Sorry I didn't see this, but honestly yeah it'd be really nice. It's not a priority though.
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 19:47:46 Lol, I've applied more 5 times now and have been shot down, it's kinda funny 🤷🏿‍♂️
the-dump 2022-01-11 00:28:16 See the gray on my 944? Got a scrape on it a while ago, small fender bender. Close friends helped me put some primer on it and plan to repaint it to its stock alpine white color… unless if I use it as a Victory mark spot considering it’d match the planned theme in mind 🤠

plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:37:19 I’m just gonna ask this; why does everyone throw around the term nuclear reactor powered plane when that doesn’t contextually make sense given that the basis of a nuclear reactor is to literally use steam heated by uranium fission to turn a giant turbine that’s akin to a generator? It makes sense if you’re talking about the avionics and various systems that power the aircraft but not the engines themselves?
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:37:54 Let me look into that lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:45:26 Okay, so that’s what everyone means. They seem like they’d be more practical if they were remotely cost effective
the-dump 2022-01-20 11:55:56 Made this in just draw 2 under 40 mins, not bad
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:01:12 A little unusual/unsound  in terms of context and description, but uh, yeah <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 🤷🏾‍♂️
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:02:05 (Not much sense made tbh)
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:04:38 Lol, no I mean the fat intake thing but that is also understandable : )
general 2022-01-20 12:09:36 Peugeot
general 2022-01-20 12:14:17 Those are good
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:29:26 I wouldn’t say having canards doesn’t make sense, it just depends on the purpose. This was kind of just a fun draw?
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:31:32 While that’s obvious, wasn’t another one of its main purposes also to increase its maneuverability in the event it does engage within a WVR combat situation to help increase its overall instantaneous and sustained turn radius? (Which is a result of increasing its lift?)
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:34:52 Lol, one of their main intentions is also to add maneuverability though. Especially for typically heavy aircrafts that have a much longer recovery time, which is usually the case for Russian aircrafts given their purpose of typically being designed for the basis of interception. So technically, it does but it has its drawbacks as well.
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:37:19 No, they’re typically added to larger airframes to increase maneuverability is what I’m trying to say here. I agree with what you said given it’s an obvious point, but when you take an aircraft and give it canards you’re typically trying to increase its maneuverability
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:37:21 So?
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:40:14 And? We were just talking about aircrafts dedicated for interception. This aircraft has an entirely different purpose and role. While that’s pretty obvious too, don’t you think the ability for a pilot to handle his aircraft easily is important?
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:43:10 Most instances of aircrafts I think of with canards (that are added) are combat oriented. Yes there’s many civilian aircraft that use them for a different purpose, but this is just my personal thought. I can tell you the airframe I drew above isn’t an F-22,  but what I can tell you is that it would at the cost of giving it more parasitic drag, needless complexities and costs, and sure while it may increase the lift, the recovery time for the aircraft after it’s drained it’s energy into any maneuver will be much longer
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:44:06 Lol, you seem to know various experimental aircrafts. They practically did that with the F-15 STOL/MTD
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:47:35 Okay, so we’ve established this, correct? A Su-30 has canards in the front because it’s much heavier, and it affects the way it flies. Right? It alters the way it maneuvers, because it’s not gaining enough lift. So with this being said- how does the ability to gain lift not correlate with its maneuverability

Also no clue, might just wait till PC2 comes out to drop all the projects I had, a few navy ships, some passenger planes, and a hyper realistic WW1 era monoplane
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:50:30 Hope your builds go well btw 🙂 nice up to scale models, they’re impressive and remind me of a user I used to play with all the time that is long gone now
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:54:15 His name is destructive logic, he had some amazing up to scale stuff. Most of which he didn’t post… Miss him a lot, his account got shut down unfairly so he kinda just stopped playing Roblox considering he lost all of his plane crazy creations
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:58:42 Yeah he’s pretty good lately. He may come back c: 

Also yeah, he had a ridiculous amount of cars. I can swear on god that he’s made the most realistic delorean I’ve ever seen ingame and it’s uncanny af 

He also made some planes, not much. And a few dieselpunk builds. Some of his stuff is on YT but those creations were kinda made to be easy
creations-chat 2022-02-15 22:03:04 I wish I did on me now 😕 they’re on my old phone, and my pc is … not in very optimal position, so I can’t recover the pictures I did have 😦
creations-chat 2022-02-15 22:14:25 If I don’t forget, definitely! I’d love to send em over to you. I’ll see what I can do in the meantime haha

Many of his custom builds are hand drawn too : )

creations-chat 2022-02-18 18:01:14 That F2 looks pretty fucking cool, I think I’ve seen it before once but it’s damn well accurate in terms of shape.

creations-chat 2022-04-06 13:45:14 Here’s my opinion: it’s not bad at all, I actually think it’s pretty good yet it’s a little blocky. It’s not like that’s necessarily an issue and I’m not where your “skill” range exactly lies in this game, but honestly it reminds me of someone who’s a little newer relative to many people you see here. If you take the time to learn a few motorlock tricks you could easily make your current build much more streamlined. Good job honestly though : )
creations-chat 2022-04-06 13:49:27 Hey, that’s actually pretty impressive. Way better than what I first accomplished my first time around. Keep it up! You’ll get to where you want to be if you play a little more obviously.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:29:33 Thanks fr! Also if you look up there, you’ll see that I posted one haha.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:32:04 Hm, I bet not honestly. Lemme check through what you’ve built rq
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:40:25 Imo your trains are pretty well done tbh, I think they’re pretty damn awesome, and I’m not even a big fan of trains haha. I’d say what you seem to struggle slightly with is probably just color and texture usage. Your trains are very detailed and well built, but I just notice you tend to use the default colors very often and use texture in a way that takes away from even more potential details, thus making them look very cartoony despite the build itself being very proportionate and shaped well. Cartoony isn’t bad, but I don’t think it’s something you personally want. Try to implement details that make your build look like it’s been run and slightly worn.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:43:39 Np! Sorry for the long text lol. Hope you enjoy your future builds and that they look better to you! They are pretty well done.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:49:07 That’s a pretty good practice, it’s not like I didn’t notice that you didn’t do that, but thats just my remark as to how much color and texture make a difference🤷🏾‍♂️. It’s a lesson I definitely learned lmao
general 2022-04-06 14:51:19 Right idea, odd execution
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:58:31 Hm, noted, however ironic when I think about it considering that (rarely) yet occasionally I’d hear it was the other way around for me. Thanks though!
general 2022-04-06 15:02:11 Oddly enough that may not be as bad, why though? Because it’s seemingly harder to be toxic on those platforms and you find a lot less people who are as a result lol

Probably also dead in comparison to the discord imo
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:11:50 Hm, well while that view is understandable up to some extent- I think you may be overlooking quite a bit. The “holes” in the wings are pretty much there because I couldn’t make the roll function a possible thing (due to the way I build) unless if I made them like that, the shape is actually pretty decent imo, looks fairly appropriate for the time period I tried going for, and the “vertical slabs” (I cant tell if you meant elevators/horizontal control surfaces, or the rudder itself) they’re proportionate in size to the plane and actually do function extremely well when it flies. It looks like any high aspect ratio, early tail plane to me 🤷🏾‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:16:27 Thanks for reading all of that lmao, but  yeah basically that was the intention. Although I think I probably could have covered up those holes now that I think of it- it’s very difficult (due to the way I built the wings) and a very minor, pretty much near unnoticeable cosmetic change
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:22:09 I wish that was the case, but nah I tried that. The wings are a half a block thick, so that means that the area dedicated to the be the roll control panel also has to be half a block thick (so it doesn’t look stupid.) When you try to move that surface, it collides with the block next to it as a result because it can’t move, and ends up spazzing for me. If I place a angled 1x1 half block, with a control surface panel locked over it, I can move the surface up, but I can’t move it down due to collision.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:51:12 There’s plenty of instances where I have hidden the gap, but wait, wdym I cant do custom control panels? That whole surface is a custom control panel, lol. It’s different than a typical wing or a wing that’s a block thick, because you can just use something with a rounded surface (or a cutter) so that you’re not creating collision with the wing itself. If I do that, you’re basically just creating another collision spot, which I was talking about this earlier as to why I can’t do that. If the wing is half a block thick, that doesn’t work (which is usually the thickness I go for)
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:57:52 Yup, all it has is just a gap. Personally can’t see why you may have thought otherwise, but oh well 🤷🏾‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:28:01 Hm, I have a feeling if the top profile wasn’t there these remarks wouldn’t be a thing. Although noted, it’s just odd given that I can’t really see how they are just because of a hole that pretty much every aircraft with a half a block wing I have has one of those. Thanks for the feedback nonetheless : )
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:32:58 The wing is sitting dihedrally and it’s further swept back, with the position and the place that it’s in, there’s not enough room for a piston lock to work (if I’m thinking of what you have in mind) given that I tried this too lol.
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:36:52 Thanks, really appreciated! I’ll make use of the feedback given haha
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:13:00 Thanks man! Sorry for taking so long, I really appreciate it!

creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:03:33 He wouldn’t go through all this trouble to defend something that isn’t his, he’s probably a newer player and realistically it’s not that bad looking relative to other beginner players.

creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:05:37 I would assume he’s been offline💀plane crazy isn’t a lifestyle, like I literally do the same shit just not up to the same extent, I wouldn’t be surprised if he did 💀
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:10:01 Well for 1- it’s a pretty common plane type, for 2- if you’re a less experienced player you tend to use default colors, for 3 if it is based on his, why does it matter when you don’t even like the way they look to begin with? And number 4, it’s literally a game. Freak coincidences happen and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case. I’ve seen so many B-17s that idk why his stands out to you enough to critique him over something so meaningless
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:14:28 Like, even if it is a tutorial plane (which I won’t lie it kinda looks like it) it shouldn’t be a surprise you see it here, and it shouldn’t be worth arguing over 💀people do this kinda stuff over the years often just with different builds. Remember the dreaded tank raptor f22? Like fuck yeah people  knew that it was a tutorial, but they’d just downvote the hell outta it instead of trying to critique him over something meaningless, y’know? Like yeah it sucks but people have been doing this for years, so why does his stand out again?
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:17:24 WDYM LOL bro ain’t no way. I know that’s a default color for one, for two- same cockpit glass but same plane and similar skill level, for three, you’d be surprised how many people do just that, I’ve seen B-17s that look like that so often from people who are barely starting and don’t even realize that plane crazy has videos on yt simply because they think it’s not that popular of a game (conventionally speaking) make b-17s very similar to the point where it DOES look like a tutorial 🤷🏾‍♂️, like idk man just saying
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:20:48 Lol, change the middle value to 80. Again, pretty common color
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:23:53 Lol, lemme rephrase this because maybe that wasn’t worded the best; when I implied “default” I mean to say that while it is a default color, it’s own of the most  commonly used colors simply because it’s an easy color to get first time in the game, right? Think of it like that
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:30:37 Great point honestly, but it is a small peeve of mine to see someone who’s relatively new get messed around with for pretty meaningless reasons 🤷🏾‍♂️, so oops?

Damn, didn’t expect that many lol. I was expecting about 200 at most. Now almost 300! Not bad. Has more than a build that was originally my most liked creation. Thanks for the upvotes, I appreciate the compliments and critiques I got. 

Note: I should probably also take into note that the population of the server has went up since I’ve posted anything, but whatever lol
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:14:59 Hm, honestly I’ll try again maybe. I’ve tried a few times before but I hear a lot of reasons why it usually doesn’t go through for me haha. Ty for the suggestion!
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:19:09 Thanks man!
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:24:37 Using a motorlock tower you can have various objects that are typically 4x4 blocks with wedges rotated at different angles. The bottommost rotation lock stays still, the second one rotates at a speed of .2, the top two rotate at .1, except one of those has to also rotate in an opposite direction. You just gotta line up the second rotation lock by 90 degrees, then others will follow suit due to the speed they’re rotating at.
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:34:26 Aye thanks man! I appreciate it
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:47:16 I just wish they’d fix the stupid bs where the missiles can’t really track well
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 04:50:56 The rockets with close tracking, it just seems like they have super limited range and as a result, most fights in PvP seem more about luck rather than skill, especially if they’re both fast

Just sayin, this is stuff I remember learning in middle school
creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:15:26 This lol, once again facial and musculature reconstruction is a proven, working, used thing for a reason
creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:19:05 Once again, if you can tell the social patterns of an animal, it’s dietary habits, muscular structure, facial structure, and even pigments depending on remnants of genetic material left in its skull structure, there’s many ways to come to logical conclusions, so yes you can in a limited sense

Asking why a certain creature would need to see better or wouldn’t have a reason to need to see is a very common thing

general 2023-07-16 19:11:28 Lmao, I find it crazy that I remember how some bozos on here would try to correct me on actual aircraft mechanics & physics (then fail miserably in the process)
general 2023-07-16 19:11:40 …. when I’m literally an Aircraft Mechanic & getting training for Aerospace Engineering (Yes I have my AP.)
general 2023-07-16 19:12:16 Yeah I remember you too, you were always pretty cool : )
general 2023-07-16 19:13:02 Sometimes, it is
general 2023-07-16 19:14:41 Depends on where you go & how you learn. Some places aren’t as hands on or some are more by the book. Where I’m at (U of A), they’re pretty textbook. The courses aren’t too hard, but there’s just so much shit to memorize
general 2023-07-16 19:14:57 At Pima, they make you take some of the test verbally
general 2023-07-16 19:16:36 I’d say you should go for what you want if you enjoy it : )
general 2023-07-16 19:18:25 Don’t let it intimidate you, we all start somewhere and there’s always a difficult aspect of any job or path. In this case, it’s the memorization of terms and FAA regulations that you realistically won’t do jack shit with 💀 

Just make sure to try to go to schools that cater more to your learning style : )
general 2023-07-16 19:19:29 There’s many people who don’t even go to school, they just know someone who gets them a foot in the door and maybe do a bit of school after, but manage to get their licenses through work experience after they document what they’ve done and show it to the FAA/whoever may be hiring
general 2023-07-16 19:19:41 Legit kinda what happened to me💀
general 2023-07-16 19:21:19 (What Aazo said) do what you love, if you like aviation and design, Aerospace Engineering is where it’s at!

general 2023-07-16 19:23:37 Then go for it : ) they can only scold you for so long. I wonder why they’re scolding you in the first place though. Is it Money related or family legacy related?
general 2023-07-16 19:27:31 Makes sense. I can imagine they aren’t going to want to listen, until you just do it yourself. If there’s one thing I’ve learned as someone with an Engineer’s brain surrounded by Mechanics, full send that shit and just do it

general 2023-07-16 19:38:35 Weird
general 2023-07-16 19:39:03 What about uhh… damn what’s his name
general 2023-07-16 19:39:06 He was like
general 2023-07-16 19:39:57 He was some dude notorious for critiquing builds while simultaneously not being the best at them himself or having standards he couldn’t fulfill
general 2023-07-16 19:40:07 Ngl that doesn’t even narrow it down…
general 2023-07-16 19:40:16 No no not hars
general 2023-07-16 19:40:38 His name was always spoke about in creations chat
general 2023-07-16 19:41:17 He was a part of that big 3 but it wasn’t hars I was thinking of lmao
general 2023-07-16 19:42:08 Hars, Zachman, and there’s one other guy I’m missing
general 2023-07-16 19:43:49 True, but I remember him being on my case with no real good reason sometimes :/ like he didn’t forget about the fact that this is just a game at the end of the day
general 2023-07-16 19:45:44 He has some weird shirtless picture as a pfp
general 2023-07-16 19:46:21 YEAH THATS WHO
general 2023-07-16 19:52:33 Bro would occasionally hound me anytime my builds would get high amounts of likes and try to harshly critique me… while calling other people no life’s when the dude himself has thousands of pages worth of chats on this server alone.
general 2023-07-16 19:52:49 I’m sure that he’s not a bad person, but everyone has things about them that make them good usually. I just remember him for being rude due to my limited but notable experiences with him
general 2023-07-16 19:54:19 Results are different than pages lol, I haven’t even been on in the last few months til now 💀
general 2023-07-16 19:55:23 Huh
general 2023-07-16 19:56:18 Ikr 😩I legit even said he’s not a bad person, I just didn’t have good experiences with him personally
general 2023-07-16 19:57:51 Thanks! I appreciate it a lot. I can say I have a bit of experience elsewhere that made it easier to do so in-game
general 2023-07-16 19:58:44 Wdym, whole plane only took 2-3 hours
general 2023-07-16 20:01:26 Bruh….
general 2023-07-16 20:02:42 As I was trying to say: 

This is why the community itself fell apart. I genuinely hope you enjoy all of your lives, and the game as a whole, but man this is rough watching these dump fires happen
general 2023-07-16 20:03:31 Crazy thing is, you’re telling this to someone who is an actual mechanic (yes I have an AP license)  and currently in college for aerospace engineering at the U of A, 2nd year.
general 2023-07-16 20:04:04 Arizona. University of Arizona.
general 2023-07-16 20:06:27 Lol, I somewhat doubt that, but okay. It’s a game and it’s an aircraft with inspiration from early 20th century designs that have portions of their “rib cages” (airframes)  exposed.
general 2023-07-16 20:11:53 I really see why so many OG’s have left
general 2023-07-16 20:15:00 Not yet…
general 2023-07-16 20:15:31 Don’t forget the random unchecked (and impossible to extinguish) toxicity, while waiting for the next PC2 to come out, etc… list goes on
general 2023-07-16 20:16:47 That’s unfortunate, seems to only be adding to my point
general 2023-07-16 20:21:57 Lol I really want to understand where this specific type of behavior in PCC started from, it kinda reminds me of how people from Reddit develop extreme opinions due to some forums acting as echo chambers
general 2023-07-16 20:22:27 Lol
general 2023-07-16 20:23:45 Lol
general 2023-07-16 20:24:32 Even he can improve, and has
general 2023-07-16 20:33:14 https://tenor.com/view/mike-tyson-looking-away-pain-tysonpain-gif-19426728
general 2023-07-16 20:35:28 The more you shout in the echo chamber, the more echoes you’ll receive
general 2023-07-16 20:36:11 See? Lol
general 2023-07-16 20:40:56 https://tenor.com/view/ernie-sesame-street-smh-shaking-my-head-dismay-gif-18210872
general 2023-07-16 22:28:04 Echo Chamber
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:30:14 It doesn’t even matter how good or bad something is, it will always be bad to someone no matter what and that’s okay. Just make sure you enjoy yourself and the game. If you start to argue on this server, you just get consumed by the echo chamber it is without realizing you’re in it.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:34:50 Personally, I’d just say look at the types of people on the server and the name of the game. You have more people looking for vehicles, not animals 🤷🏿‍♂️. It’s just a more niche topic. I can also imagine what you’re saying to be true, I just have no personal experience on the reddit
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:42:14 Yes but most people are right about most things they say. The difference is how far you can take an opinion. That’s why I say “echo chamber” so much.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:49:12 Yes, you’re right. But there will be someone else won’t like your gas station, and their response will be typically taken as a negative response at that. Plenty of people vote on what the build is, doesn’t mean it’s everyone who does but it’s enough to notice 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

(Ex. how good builds can still end up with dislikes. It’s preferential)
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:52:43 Also yes! You’re going to have to come up with a more complicated solution to achieve that goal, but it’s expected. Either way conceptually it’s pretty cool and works for what you intended it to do (pretty sick mechanism Fr)
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:56:10 He cares about the fact you’re replying to him, not the content of what you’ve said lol
creations-chat 2023-07-16 23:03:51 I think it’d be pretty worthwhile. It looks like you could make the barrel thinner and slightly shorter too. Maybe instead of using blocks, build the barrel from disconnectors and disconnect them when you spawn, or even those little hatches/doors. You can use a dead key so you don’t accidentally use them
creations-chat 2023-07-16 23:13:43 Guy above answered that question, but what <@650765213204742154> said is also a good suggestion. You could compress large stacks of hover engines to propel your round
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:29:46 It’s genuinely interesting that so many people want extremely detailed builds, yet some of those people who end up seeing those examples of extremely detailed builds, call them over detailed. I want to ask anyone here who can answer this:
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:29:54 What’s your problem with an over detailed build?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:31:55 Interesting. While the likes of my creations say they aren’t bad, the people who typically dislike my creations have most notably always said that I’ll over-detail them, or some part of them in relation to everything else. But typically it’s something that I can’t add that detail to.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:32:30 Only asking out of curiosity*
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:33:05 Well, you did see my reasoning for this right? It’s supposed to be inspired by early 20th century aircraft, but it’s a custom design as a whole.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:33:12 
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:34:36 Yes, that’s the airframe rib-cage. Like the Bleriot XI above, it’s a portion of it that’s exposed
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:35:59 It’s not supposed to be the Bleriot, it’s supposed to be inspired by aircraft of that time. That portion also is hollow, lol that’s why you can actually look inside of it
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:36:48 ?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:37:27 But.. that is it, haha.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:39:15 So, you want me to remove 3/4ths of the trails from the end, when it’s already hollow, but the majority of the likes say it looks good otherwise? 

Interesting.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:39:37 Haha, the Aircraft above isn’t hollow either. There’s structural elements that keep the frame from folding, and a lot of them too.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:40:37 I can though, lol. Because I like my creations, and you don’t have to.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:42:05 Okay, this is what I’m trying to get at. There’s literally nothing wrong with this. I’m just trying to understand your perspective, that’s all. Nothing harmful done whatsoever. My question, is why does your opinion have to be the final word to everyone else?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:43:13 Okay, so now I understand it’s bad to you, I wanted to know why and I asked. Thank you for telling me, I appreciate it. With this being said…
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:45:19 If you never said it does, and it really doesn’t matter if most find it good except you and a select few, then why say this to someone or many people  who won’t even agree when you make the statement? Is it because you want to be heard?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:47:11 Yeah, why so? I know I asked, but why would someone need to say this, to someone who didn’t ask?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:49:06 Okay, so your intention is to help someone, when they didn’t ask for help?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:49:52 So in-conclusion, the majority of the argumentative interactions in this server, are a result of someone trying to help someone who doesn’t want help, and them seeing it as an insult?
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:50:20 I know, I know. I asked that question with a very different intention though.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:50:42 Once again, thank you. I’ll take it to heart and see what I can do later on.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 23:59:27 Let me create a timeline of what goes on in creations chat- 

-> OP posts build. 

-> build gets lots of likes or lots of dislikes, or both. 

-> someone says something about X build. 

->Y person wants to help them make it better to them, somehow. 

->Y person says this criticism, without saying why they’ve said it or making it sound much more harsh than it is, without intending to or realizing it. 

-> OP says something to Y person as a retort, usually because they don’t understand why they don’t like that part of X build, or why they don’t even like the entirety of X build. 

-> argument between OP and X ensues

-> argument dies

-> argument leaves both OP and X somewhat Bitter, due to a lack of understanding why their sentiments and reactions the way they are 

-> argument is played off by trying to make it a joke, or that bitterness is pushed onto someone else
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:00:47 Conclusion: 
———————
So almost every argument that goes on in this server…. Is just a gigantic lack of communication and understanding, which leads to bitter sentiments and a want to prove the statements that you aren’t taking to understand from one another wrong?
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:01:15 Huh. Interesting.
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:38:32 I’m doing extremely well irl lol, I just like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 02:38:38 Lol cool
