plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:28:08 so I was flying my F-16 until I hit the propellers of the flying island and my driver's seat was cut off
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:29:03 the driver's seat fell near the spawn with me on it (I used a parachute)
and the plane WAS STILL FLYING AROUND until it crashed of course
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:29:20 
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:29:25 This is it
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:29:43 Well
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 21:30:01 You should have seen the plane fly on its own before crashing

plane-crazy 2021-02-20 13:55:18 So I made my first build -its a jet- and because it goes on 500mph my lil laptop can't handle it and I don't know if it's unstable or not lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 15:18:15 Yeah it's a 9 year old laptop lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:56:13 Guys my jet is unstable can anyone join my game to help?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:56:39 Ugh
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:56:45 It will be bad quality
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:56:53 I'm taking the pics with my phone
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:57:03 No screenshots unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:58:19 
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:58:50 It drifts to the left side and then downwards
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:59:07 I have no idea of how to stabilize it
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:59:45 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:59:48 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 20:59:57 There's something I didn't try
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:00:04 There's a lot of space inside
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:00:15 Maybe I could put some wing panels inside
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:09:57 So I filled the inside and the nose of the jet with wing panels but it's still not enough
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:10:23 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:11:00 I don't like the idea of that cause it doesn't show up on the yellow and blue crosses
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:11:48 Maybe double wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:11:52 I have room for that
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 21:16:56 Holy-
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 22:32:35 **F L O P P Y**
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:02:40 So guys
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:02:49 I just made my first build
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:02:53 It's a jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:03:00 Let's start
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:03:17 Upper view:
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:03:30 Paint job took quite some time
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:03:51 Front view:
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:03:59 My first build
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:04:04 It's a jet dude
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:04:20 
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:04:25 And the back
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:04:56 Reaches max of 500 speed
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:05:11 Handling is very stable
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:05:24 I worked on this for hours
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:05:36 1180+ parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:06:16 Forgot to mention it has double wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:06:22 To add lift
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:06:54 Also works with keybinds using motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:07:40 Also foldable window
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:08:56 There's one issue tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 23:09:15 **N o t  e n o u g h  r o c k e t s**
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 14:53:04 There's MANY transformers games
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 16:37:40 This shows how dumb bug shredder users really are:

||The guy litteraly tried to shred my  explode on impact bombs, one shot kill||
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 16:38:38 Idk if there are
creations-chat 2021-02-21 19:49:52 Guys why did everyone absolutely hate my jet
creations-chat 2021-02-21 19:53:39 I worked hard on it, it was a 3 day project, ended up with 1287 blocks, 0 Upvotes and 3 downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:46:29 Guys
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:46:51 Is there any way to lock motor 2s until you press a keybind?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:47:08 Yeah I mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:47:16 Not from the settings
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:48:14 Didn't get that
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:48:31 uhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:48:41 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:49:05 making the motor 2 unable to move until I click a keybind
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:49:46 Kinda
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:50:15 servo but then being able to unservo
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:50:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:51:22 but
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:51:36 then how am I gonna use mouse control-
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:51:53 hm
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:52:23 maybe if I make something that limits angle a lot while also being able to eject
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:52:50 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:53:48 I have a missile from a tutorial on my keybind controlled plane that works with mouse control but it affects flight a lot cause it can use mouse control before launching
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:54:48 yeah wait
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 16:54:55 lemme screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 17:18:42 guys
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 17:18:51 how do I deal with weight?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 17:19:05 My jet is very heavy
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 17:19:27 So It turns quite slow

plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:44:56 guys do we have any idea if there's gonna be preset pvp guided missiles and bombs/guided bombs in PC2? it would be hard to get used to at first but i think it would work
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:46:21 Also what if we could turn off grid mode and build/rotate however
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:46:38 I think atleast the 2nd one is a good idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:35:08 yo guys i need help
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:35:39 i built this F14 tutorial https://youtu.be/0u9yQdMSj0s
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:35:47 and theres something wrong with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:36:04 ;-;
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:36:47 i am
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:36:49 so
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:37:05 the right side doesnt motorlock correctly
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:37:13 and it leaves an opening
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:37:49 nono i found the issue i just dont know how to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:38:08 the build is nice but the tutorial itself was ass
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:38:20 hold on lemme screenshot it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:39:05 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:39:34 i tried putting the other side's motorlock to touch the black part
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:39:41 and it happened to the other side
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:40:39 basically whatever touches this black part breaks the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:40:47 its a half block
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:41:03 or not
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:41:22 idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:41:41 no i like it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:41:44 its life size

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:42:31 yeh so it turns out it was a normal block and not a half block
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:43:09 do you know how fucking big the f14 is in real life?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:44:10 ok wait u confused me

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:44:42 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:44:53 it IS 3 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:45:58 anyways
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:46:11 is there a way to make a motorlock be 3 wide?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:51:37 oh i fixed it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 13:08:02 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 13:08:29 wHaTCH Languaguage
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:11:21 yo guys is there any way to make a conveyor engine act as an afterburner?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:11:47 in the sense that if u hold the throttle up button after throttle is max then it enables
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:12:13 damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:12:36 what does WEP stand for
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:12:59 oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:13:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:18:07 yeah right now i got my main engine power on Caps Lock for Throttle Up, Left Control for Throttle Down and Left Shift to enable the conveyor engine as afterburner
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 14:21:37 bro what do you mean by weaponized 💀
help 2023-01-21 17:01:11 nah stop there
help 2023-01-21 17:01:24 except if u REALLY want it to be realistic

help 2023-01-21 17:05:19 yeah but how
help 2023-01-21 17:06:01 never used it
help 2023-01-21 17:08:10 bro roblox is trippin right now
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:51:03 guys, will we have radars in pc2? it seems like an essential right now because 5th gen fighters in pc are just as powerful as 4th gen
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:52:47 im not talking about 1:1 radars, im talking about a fun lil thing that can detect players with a UI
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:53:14 Maybe more things for cockpit designs would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:54:01 How would motorlock make a good looking interior
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:54:10 You literally cant
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 13:59:23 Im not talking about making the game have literally 0 skill where u can click and get a freakin nose or somethin, what I'm suggesting is more stuff to make the interior and a radar block. The radar block could point in only 1 direction so you'll have to be more creative if you want a full view of whats around you
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:00:06 bro what 💀💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:00:14 I said it would detect players
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:00:20 As the map will be bigger
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:01:00 The map in pc2 will be bigger and as shown it will also have tunnels
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:01:19 Also you would be able to see submarines
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:03:05 Oh no but a radar wouldnt make sense oooo
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:03:45 Not if the radar has range
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:06:46 I really dont see anyone sitting at spawn but shredders
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:08:11 Also from the little research i just did on google only brand new radar technology can detect submarines
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:08:21 So they'd be safe in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:08:33 If radars were added
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:09:08 honestly when you have a conveyor engine they're not much of a problem anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:10:01 If the submarine is underwater it shouldn't be detected but idk about the coding for that
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:10:24 its probably possible
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:10:36 Like
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 14:12:03 He could make an invisible part with collision off under and over the water and make it so if its touching the one under the water the radar doesnt detect but if its touching the one over or both it detects
