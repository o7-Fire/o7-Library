creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:43:47 OMG ITS SO CUTEEE
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:40:14 you guys sure get aggressive for a box
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:43:52 if anything it seems shitty than you guys are arguing over the quality rather than the actual wrong holiday itself
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:47:02 I’m surprised that people are arguing over ethics of a Roblox game

creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:48:05 <@456226577798135808> p sure f5 does not have that large of a leading edge sweep angle
creations-chat 2022-01-06 02:02:36 spine of f5 levels out right at the base of the vertical stabilizer iirc
-plus it’s just really bulky in general

creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:03:55 vertical wing 💀
creations-chat 2022-03-02 01:20:29 I’d make 3d intakes and not just colored first then I’d prob get a new wing design that’s more interesting than a delta or a bigger delta
creations-chat 2022-03-02 01:23:01 maybe double delta? I suppose for a fast looking plane you want really highly swept wings so really I’d just make the delta larger
creations-chat 2022-03-02 02:29:02 definitely better but the intakes are still not as good as it could be

You could make them actual intakes and not just black printed blocks
