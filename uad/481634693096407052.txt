The Tale of 213andypandy (481634693096407052)
general 2019-10-06 11:44:21 finally verified after being in the server for like 3 weeks now
general 2019-10-06 11:49:02 epic\
general 2019-10-06 11:49:20 they are extra friction wheels lol
general 2019-10-07 22:16:20 are organizing raids illegal on this server
general 2019-10-07 22:16:36 bc meepcity is really starting to piss me off
general 2019-10-07 22:16:55 how can such a bad game be on the front page constantly
general 2019-10-07 22:17:50 and how come the game is exempt from the no dating rule, that basically the mechanic of the game
general 2019-10-07 22:18:41 ok
general 2019-10-14 22:24:36 its not like im taking any people that weren't already in your server away from you. We are in two different categories, I promise it will not harm your community in any way,
general 2019-10-14 22:25:15 I encourage you to re-evaluate your decision but respect your choice to warn me.
general 2019-10-14 22:25:36 I will not do it again unless given permission
general 2019-10-14 22:33:44 What im saying is that its not the same as posting another plane crazy server, this is an entirely different game that isnt even made by the same person
general 2019-10-14 22:34:11 it would be different if i was a competitor server or something like that
general 2019-10-17 23:09:43 What if there was a tnt detonator block, so when tnt touches it, the tnt explodes
general 2019-10-17 23:38:37 wait really?
general 2019-10-17 23:38:47 time to make a tnt engine!!!
general 2019-10-20 23:49:03 i should try to somehow make a engine using tnt
general 2019-10-20 23:49:10 that would be cool
general 2019-10-20 23:49:34 why not
general 2019-10-20 23:49:56 hm
general 2019-10-20 23:50:02 good point
general 2019-10-20 23:50:22 isnt there a damage slider you can adjust
general 2019-10-20 23:50:54 it will generate blast force against the piston
general 2019-10-20 23:51:19 hm i guess i will have to recreate will a magnet
general 2019-10-20 23:51:34 hm
general 2019-10-20 23:51:39 alrihgt
general 2019-10-20 23:52:08 hmmmmmm
general 2019-10-20 23:52:11 i got it!
general 2019-10-20 23:52:33 i will have a crank shaft on the top that moves the magnet up and down
general 2019-10-20 23:53:12 so when the piston below is at its highest point, the piston above will come down and push the bottom piston
general 2019-10-20 23:53:40 maybe i could make some rudimentary gears to time the downward swing
general 2019-10-28 01:58:17 what will they do
general 2019-10-28 01:58:22 MUTE MY STATUS?
general 2019-10-28 01:58:58 ooh how do i get the inventor status
general 2019-11-09 23:48:43 They should add oscillating magnet option
general 2019-11-09 23:49:04 So you can choose how many second a magnet is on or off
general 2019-11-10 18:49:54 NNN has been canceled
general 2019-11-10 18:53:20 forever
general 2019-11-10 21:51:03 Tell isis my shitty plane gets 30 max
general 2019-11-10 21:55:27 30speed
general 2019-11-10 21:56:00 tf is sps
general 2019-11-10 21:56:46 i think it is studs per second lol
general 2019-11-10 21:57:15 *speed per studs*
general 2019-11-10 21:59:32 Plane crazy is the only roblox game i know to have the decency to make a discord
general 2019-11-10 22:01:08 well
general 2019-11-10 22:01:16 The main other game i play is lt2
general 2019-11-10 22:01:45 and lt2 discords generally suck
general 2019-11-10 22:02:09 maybe that warps my perception
general 2019-11-10 22:02:23 Lumber tycoon 2
general 2019-11-10 22:02:49 have you ever played lt2
general 2019-11-10 22:03:04 it is not like a tycoon pretty much
general 2019-11-10 22:03:36 its like a building exploration game
general 2019-11-10 22:04:36 but you dont step on tiles all day and wait
general 2019-11-10 22:04:45 it is different
general 2019-11-10 23:21:02 lt2 has items you can collect and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 23:27:11 there should be a really big map to fly around
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 23:27:22 it would be cool
general 2019-11-11 00:25:06 i wonder what the smallest plane you could make is
general 2019-11-11 00:25:30 i dont think it is the 7 block one that someone made
bot-central 2019-11-11 00:26:28 &suggest Block placement mode without a grid
general 2019-11-11 01:17:53 Does anyone know if gyroscopes work
