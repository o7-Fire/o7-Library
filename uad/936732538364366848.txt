general 2022-07-06 01:02:24 How do I make like turrets and stuff
general 2022-07-06 01:02:44 I’ve seen a bunch of dudes with fully swiveling turrets and I don’t know how to do that
general 2022-07-06 01:04:02 I tried doing that, maybe I’m just not using it right
general 2022-07-06 01:04:05 I’m pretty new
general 2022-07-06 01:12:53 It’s not working
general 2022-07-06 22:57:01 I spent wayyyy too long making a scorpion tank from halo

plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:56:53 why doesn't my plane work properly? i have the center of gravity and center of lift lined up perfectly, and yet it just spins in circles once off the ground
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:57:55 ?
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:58:01 no idea what that is
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:58:36 i have two
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:58:56 is that the issue?
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:59:16 yeah i had two
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:59:23 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 13:59:51 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:00:40 got it fixed. it was because i added a detail on top of it
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:15:16 Who downvoted the blimp
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:17:34 Why? It’s insanely epic
bug-reports 2022-07-08 20:19:37 Mild bug I experienced:
My plane worked fine in non-pvp, but then I switched to pvp made 0 changes and it completely stopped working. I had saved it before switching game modes and loaded the saved version (I know auto save doesn’t save constantly).
bug-reports 2022-07-08 23:38:10 *inhales* imma try not to seem like an asshole about this.
**read it again. Carefully**
help 2022-07-08 23:40:30 Counterweight in the back. Or ballast block. I had a similar issue with my plane earlier and that fixed it (it was a balancing issue, it was too nose-heavy)
help 2022-07-08 23:40:57 Ballast blocks and counterweights are the best ways to fix balance issues
help 2022-07-08 23:41:02 As far as I know at least

general 2022-07-08 23:42:35 Hmmmmm yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 23:43:06 Be a true Chad and ditch the wings
creations-chat 2022-07-08 23:48:23 Sir are you forklift certified /j
general 2022-07-08 23:50:35 Ahhh yes cat memes
general 2022-07-08 23:50:54 This pleases the meme dealer
general 2022-07-08 23:56:30 You need rank 3 to do media
bot-central 2022-07-08 23:56:58 !rank
general 2022-07-08 23:57:22 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 23:58:22 Hmmm yes it is w i n g l e s s
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:00:21 Yeah well your insults need to be WIP too cuz I’ve seen em all before so shut yo ass up or get something original
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:01:19 Resorting to repeating unoriginal insults? Guess I won
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:02:32 Not much. If you really want my game stepped up, then entertain me better. Either that, or give up. You won’t get much outta me with shit I’ve seen already
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:07:37 If you’ve completed even one build that didn’t function properly at first, you’re better than I am
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:08:22 No one:
Minecraft players finding a village:
creations-chat 2022-07-09 00:11:41 Yeah that sounds like how this comes about
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:12:23 Old enough to know that age isn’t relevant to memes
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:12:51 Also old enough to know that I could literally tell you any age and you’d have no way to know any better
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:14:00 Clearly, you’ve never seen some other roblox discords.
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:14:22 People constantly act different online
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:14:33 True.
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:14:50 I’m just saying, some people act younger than they really are on discord
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:14:55 Some do it for humor
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:16:00 It doesn’t matter
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:16:16 I got what I needed out of this server, and that was how the game functions
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:16:24 I only stay cuz I’m bored
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:16:54 I would
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:17:02 But I got nothin I wanna build
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:17:11 Meh
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:17:23 This place doesn’t offer much in the way of entertainment either
the-dump 2022-07-09 00:18:43 That is correct. I do not like my ideas because my ideas are ludicrous and often not possible given the current tools at my disposal
bot-central 2022-07-09 00:19:00 Still no idea what that’s supposed to do
bot-central 2022-07-09 00:19:10 You could ping staff and have em check
bot-central 2022-07-09 00:19:19 I guarantee you won’t get any dirt on me
general 2022-07-09 00:20:45 I’ve seen people use pistons, I’ve seen rockets, I’ve seen motors. There are tons of ways
general 2022-07-09 00:21:03 The issue is balance and figuring out how to make it walk properly
general 2022-07-09 00:21:18 Other than that it’s just blocks
general 2022-07-09 00:22:29 You can check for yourself
general 2022-07-09 00:22:37 I’m not getting doxxed
general 2022-07-09 00:23:15 Meh. Mostly paranoia.
general 2022-07-09 00:23:31 Again
general 2022-07-09 00:23:34 You can check
general 2022-07-09 00:23:58 Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one who has ideas all the time
general 2022-07-09 00:24:10 Go think up an idea of where or shut the fuck up dumbass
general 2022-07-09 00:24:17 No
general 2022-07-09 00:24:20 The opposite
general 2022-07-09 00:24:45 This is discord. I do hope that you’re being sarcastic.
general 2022-07-09 00:25:07 I never denied that I was a jackass
general 2022-07-09 00:25:41 Where are you pulling that I denied that I’m an asshole
general 2022-07-09 00:27:56 Honestly imma just be the mature one and stop arguing on discord. The average discord user legit will not stop even when they have nothing new to come up with
general 2022-07-09 00:28:25 Welp, imma disappear into a more entertaining hellhole
