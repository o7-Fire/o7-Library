bug-reports 2021-02-09 23:20:43 I tried using ice for my wings on a glider for experimental purposes, and it just started bugging out and it went nearly max speed
bug-reports 2021-02-09 23:22:04 Actually I just tried all default material and it still bugged out
bug-reports 2021-02-09 23:22:28 Pretty sure its just the wings though

Nose cone too small
Gun positions are too small
(Don't know what its calle) but the line that sticks out, should be lower and to the side
Also add some wear and shading
Plus what is that red thing at the front with something sticking out?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:05:22 https://streamable.com/ftuqt8
Why does it veer into different directions even though everything is symmetrical
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:07:55 Oh wait I just realized one of my control surfaces wasn't set to a key I don't press, frick
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:30:07 Shoot, I'll redo the paintjob I didn't notice that

creations-chat 2021-03-02 21:37:09 WHAT JET? It has got to be modeled after something
creations-chat 2021-03-03 19:08:11 Motor lock sticking out makes it look a bit off, but get rid of that standard propeller and make a custom one with a pointy tip. Also put a small little exhaust right on the nose just like real one. Maybe change that canopy it looks too big.

creations-chat 2021-07-11 22:31:24 <@!629905329513299978> Not all heavy haul trucks have caution flags so I'm still debating if I should put the effort into adding that.

creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:56:45 So I've been looking for something to put on the lowboy trailer but I don't know what to haul on it. Anybody got ideas? (remember I sort of have limited space for details and size since this is supposed to be mini scale)
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:58:59 But like it's a trailer meant for heavy hauling. I don't get what you're aiming for.

general 2022-11-28 00:02:05 hehe hi
creations-chat 2023-01-23 17:31:18 was going to make a small locomotive like this a while ago but never finished
very pro though you beat me to it üëç
creations-chat 2023-02-04 05:27:13 bro got to it before I did üò≠
started I'd say more than a year ago in the same scale
creations-chat 2023-02-04 05:32:33 got the "chassis" finished but still missing the tender, cab, and boiler
was going for the less streamlined version of it with most of the side exposed
I might finish it, but it's very likely I won't
creations-chat 2023-02-04 06:30:04 ayo should I continue my T-1 and finish it?
or is it a lost cause
ok should be finished in 2 months üíÄ
creations-chat 2023-02-12 04:40:20 <@864262887736082432> 
I see you take some inspiration with those rods
only thing I'd advise is smoothing out the edges on the prow of the boiler
otherwise great build üëç

creations-chat 2023-02-25 08:07:25 ever since the_mechanic made his mini sized locomotive there is all of a sudden a trend going on

still cool though I like to see them

there were like 3 people who made locomotives in that scale before him and there were mostly mid
was working on a locomotive that size back in December of 2021 but it ended quickly
creations-chat 2023-02-25 08:16:37 pretty sure no one wants to put in the effort to make something larger and they know they'll milk upvotes out of it because it's allegedly "roscale"

creations-chat 2023-03-22 20:39:58 fix the aft section/tail of the aircraft and adjust the windows on the upper deck to how the 747-8i really has them arranged
more specifically, the windows are too spaced out and not lined up properly ü§ì

creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:33:53 incorrect eyebrow windows (not too much of a big deal) and the nose doesn't look as close as it could be to a proper Boeing one

if you have a 707 just use that but change the rest

yeah Ik but it could be possible with a little *encouragement*
