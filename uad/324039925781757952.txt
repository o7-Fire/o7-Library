help 2020-03-07 00:32:08 (Ignore chat, attempting to make a trebuchet and i'm getting confused on how to make it work.)
My "Sky Waver" referred to as a centipede or dragon by players, not sure if this counts as a plane or what but it flies and doesn't have helium.
help 2020-03-07 00:32:26 wait, i gotta show helium count

help 2020-03-07 00:35:12 <@!195253906333368320> Does this count as a plane? Its basically a dragon or centipede.
help 2020-03-07 00:35:14 
help 2020-03-07 00:35:34 its the "Sky Waver"
help 2020-03-07 00:37:04 Wait, how does a plane fly with only wings? it would be a bird at that point
general 2020-03-07 00:39:49 in <#609442446249820211> how would a plane fly with only wings? It would be a bird, planes use engines, etc. to actually move forward.
general 2020-03-07 00:40:29 well it says for a plane it can fly with only wings

creations-chat 2020-03-07 00:59:32 why do people hate on my creation? its an original creation, may not look too pretty but that's because its not flying in the picture, plus if i was flying it, it still wouldn't look as good then it does in game. (I know people have rights for their opinion but still)
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:01:34 so basically you get mad at people using a function that's allowed?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:02:46 if it was then it would be in the rules

creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:03:31 And i un-selfvoted so if u disliked just cuz i did that then u can go un-downvote
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:04:11 its allowed and not in the rules, sorry for just doing something
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:05:05 i never have ideas and i also dont really try much, and also <@456226577798135808> you cant judge a book by its cover, The main thing is if it works good.
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:05:33 yeah i know but the main thing is if it works properly
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:05:59 and its hard to tell what my creation is capable of from just a picture.

plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:53:36 are we ever going to be able to have the option to drive somebody else's creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:04 thats why there are things called settings
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:11 add a driving whitelist
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:14 simple
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:46 do you understand what a whitelist is
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:08 thats why you can block them on roblox so u dont have to see they're chat
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:16 and u can blacklist them from your plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:50 and how is it a useless function, it would make the game so much more enjoyable getting to show your creation off on a different level
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:20 like you could have pvp matches against each other but in the other persons creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:24 it would be fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:53 how would it not
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:30 thats why theres a screwdriver
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:33 u can check the keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:56 cant u see others keybinds when they're out of they're plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:58:08 so they removed it i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:59:12 yes and roblox is highly adaptable, and its free
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:00:19 i cant code worth shid but i can build
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:00:42 but i know its not that hard, i know people that have learned most of it in like 3 months
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:01:14 i already said i cant code worth crap
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:02:19 doesnt mean i dont know struggles
