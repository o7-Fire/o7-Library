plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:15:15 From what i know the voting system is:
No motorlock: bad
Motorlock: eh
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:16:57 Motorlock added more creativity to the ones that know how to use it, and thus it raised the build standards, so by adding creativity it killed more of it
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:18:33 That's because most non motorlock builds are from new players
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:18:47 It is understandable that the quality is bad
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:18:53 But they put some effort into it
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:19:13 I know
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:19:36 But effort and patience is what makes quality over time
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:21:01 Pvp guns show damage on your screen but in reality the other plane is just fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:21:10 I do not understand that
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:22:24 The rocket after doing 7 loops near the enemy plane and then slamming on the floor:
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:23:48 A chart should be made on the  reliability of pvp blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:23:50 Like
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:24:31 The bot dislikes helicopter
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:25:07 I have a motorlock heli
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:25:14 When pitching up and down
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:25:18 It is really unstable
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:28:28 How many wip build do yall have that you know you will not finish
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:28:39 I have atleast 2
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:29:12 Can relate
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:29:30 I try to do one at a time
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:29:37 But if i focus too much on it
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:29:40 I give up
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:33:44 That looks nice
