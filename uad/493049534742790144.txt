plane-crazy 2022-05-15 08:35:15 at what speeds should i try to dogfight at?
general 2022-05-15 11:49:19 how can i post a creation in the creations channel?
general 2022-05-15 11:49:52 but im not able to put a picture
the-dump 2022-05-15 11:50:41 there is no plus
the-dump 2022-05-15 11:51:52 alr then
the-dump 2022-05-15 11:51:57 makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:51:11 is there any way i can turn off the micorphone stuff
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:51:25 the mic thingy above my head is getting annoying
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:09:56 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:10:11 bc i decided to use voice chat that one time when it released
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:10:15 bad deciion
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:10:38 also i just had the most frustrating moment in this game
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:11:04 i was chasing this dude who was missing a wing for 10 minutes trying to hit him with the rockets(im bad at pvp and also the tracking is bs)
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:11:30 and then i finally hit him
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:11:49 and all that is left of that aircraft is the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:12:05 and that mf was STILL FLYING
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:36:39 well i saw him explode adn fall apart
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:38:29 looks like a post ww2 german tank turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:38:35 forgot the name lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:38:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:38:57 dat one
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:42:29 bruh i just missed a whole missile salvo on a dude who was flying straight bc of lag delay
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 13:47:34 the then make plane crazy 2 imo they should either give the rockets a bigger tracking range and better tracking, or make sliders for it
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:41:49 what is the currently most reliable way to pvp in the air?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:43:19 ?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:44:48 then dm me the recipe

general 2022-05-15 19:08:42 and to the same stuart **TWICE**
general 2022-05-15 19:09:04 who was standing in the exact same spot
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:42:37 the f15 counts as a high wing jet ?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:47:39 yes but the wing position
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:47:56 eg su 27 is low wing
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:48:42 i think its mid wing
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:49:04 haha very funoi
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 16:50:03 lol'
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:11:34 quick queston, does my build look anything like an f15 so far? (reference image included)
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:12:45 alr
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:15:59 alr
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:19:46 too bad my mom broke my headphones while i was at school
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:23:50 she told my brother to get off my pc (im the only one with a pc except my mom so u can see how that goes, he also seems to have an addiction to it) multiple times, and he didnt listen, so she yanked him from the chair, almost pulling my whole $1k+ pc off the table, and also breaking the usb plug on my headphones
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:26:11 i once lifted our couch and put it down, but my mom's charger was under the couch in the wall while putting it down, so i fucking demolished the charger but my mom thinks the lil bro did it bc i still use micro usb and not usb c
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:29:25 the big problem is that my monitor even if its got 144hz its got no speakers inside
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:33:29 i actually once played with jesus in gta online, and some dude ask when is he dropping the bible 2, jesus said when pc2 comes out
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:37:40 ayo why are the open close and lock swapped???
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:42:06 alr this looks good so far except for the exposed mlok (yes i compressed motor lock to mlok. Why? Cuz Guns bby)
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 17:57:53 overlay also seems to be good
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:02:05 maybe like 1 block?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:02:12 or more?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:06:18 
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:09:19 ye i think i need to make the wings a lil bigger
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:10:37 eh it doesnt have to be pixel perfect
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:13:12 alr so i only changed the right wing and it seems to look better
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:13:19 now ill do the lkeft wing
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:16:00 i can dm u them
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:17:24 some sketchy image overlay software that i found on a site that is pure html
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:18:04 yea it helps make it more realisting which in turn should also make it fly better
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:19:06 just u wait
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:19:16 alr i did the left wing as well
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:19:19 now for the trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:20:58 thats the voice chat icon
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:23:08 wat like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:23:26 on the nose?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:26:14 so far it kinda like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:26:23 close enough for me tbh
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:26:31 since im planning to make it pvp oriented
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:28:59 
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:30:15 lookin nice so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:33:07 4 block motor lock is fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:33:16 i dont want the thing to be too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:34:24 нет, plane is fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:34:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:37:35 do you guys thing the 2 higlited parts are about the same lenghts?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:44:56 now how do i make this
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:45:43 this is too steep of an angle
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:53:18 not yet but very close
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 18:56:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 19:07:06 screw it its close enuf
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 19:42:57 some sketchy image overlay software
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 19:43:11 called Cthruview
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 19:43:23 nah just in html
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 19:43:30 no aestetic just text
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:07:52 u guys think this is coming along well so far?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:11:35 
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:11:40 i think its working so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:50:56 i think i screwed up the wing height
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:50:57 now what
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:53:50 but how
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:55:17 ok i got it
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 20:58:03 alr its not the end of the world
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:00:25 sanity slowly restoring
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:16:20 my sanity is restored
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:21:05 i just used their pvp guide and followed the f15 blueprints
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:33:23 alright so it can fly now but how should i cover those motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:59:47 EUFUCKINGREKA
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 21:59:52 i found the problem
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:00:05 the block was stopping the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:19:57 this f15 made me go fucking nuts
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:58:29 anyone got an idea of how coul i cover up those 2 motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:58:42 if i put a block below the motorlocks stop working
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:59:56 under the the back canopy block
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:00:13 
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:00:33 freedom/10
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:15:05 alr so  i basically finished the bulding
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:15:08 now for the paint
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:15:30 i already go 2600 max
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:15:50 yeas
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:16:13 i used smal prop engines for stall controll
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:23:20 noice, idk i just followed ther guide and the blueprint i got on the internet
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:42:35 well here it basically is
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:43:05 
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:43:25 
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:43:45 <@688282151543898143> u wantd to see it finishe right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:47:43 it already taken enoguh sanity out of me and it looks good enuf for m
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:48:22 its like 80%-90% accurate
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:48:25 good enuf for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:05:46 how u mean?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:09:01 its close enouigh
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:09:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:10:01 what did u think it was
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:10:35 bruhhhh
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:11:25 its like 90% shut
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:12:59 also this is my su plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:13:47 i made the paint myself
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:14:19 i didnt like the color scheme i found on the internet
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:15:00 i still think its better than this guys color scheme
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:18:18 and imo the pain looks decent
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:19:03 what wrong with it then
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:21:19 it was my first time trying to buil by myself and i screwed someting up so if i try to make them smaller i get wobble that idk how to fix
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:28:43 thx'
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:35:50 you really think there is an air mechanic in a roblox block building game?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 15:36:02 science isnt about why, its about why not
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 16:48:31 use 2 trails one behind the other one horizontal and one vertical, life is 0.01 i think and transparency 0.7, i also use orange and purple on it
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 16:49:02 
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 16:49:03 example
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 16:49:56 end result
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 16:51:20 also the slower the speed the shorter the trail
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:25:12 anyone know a smart way to cover this lil bit up?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:30:22 what the hell does that mean
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:31:25 you mean motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:40:33 too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:01:44 pog i just madew my afterburners even better
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:13:18 so i remover the namnam rudders and replaced the mwith normal m2m ones and it flies more stabily, and i also found a use for the pontoons
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:14:25 the video acted faster than my brain
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:16:40 well its how i found hover engines and image overlay programs
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:25:01 i love how the afterburners look at night
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:27:50 i was following a blueprint
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:28:18 i was told to follow a blueprint
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:30:59 it worked for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:37:16 how many motorlocks have yu used so far that canopy looks like its a blender model
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:37:45 just show me a screenie of all the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:38:40 if you are effiecent then im the amish with like 10 motorlocks total
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:01:39 is it just my internet or does the rocket tracking suck?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:09:06 like not only is the lock on range insanely fucking small, the rockets also overshoot inside of that range and miss the target
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:39:28 i use the paint bucket after i finish the intial building
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:47:02 the paint bucket changes all to ice
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:47:28 then i just change some specific 4 blocks with it
bot-central 2022-05-19 17:12:21 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 12:58:29 anyone got an idea of how could i make the front plates for this?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:01:07 i could use a half wedge 2 for the start of the track cover
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:17:11 motorfolding with what wedges? the 1x1 or the 1x2? im trying to build a ig its a smaller one, current width is 11 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:17:43 pog
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:17:55 ye that prob stays the same crap
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:20:54 brane too smol
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:22:07 i think so yea
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:22:16 i saw some reddit posts complaining about it
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:28:18 do you guys think the angle for this is too much or too little?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:29:55 trying to make a t34 11 block width, also i just put it on fabric material so its easier to see
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:36:11 according to the protractor site i found only the angle on the real thing is 30 degrees while 1x2 wedges have a 27 degree
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:37:05 ye i measuerd it
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:37:09 measured*
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:40:15 well the longer the wedges the more it makes a aesetic problem
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:40:56 alr got a few
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:44:50 u got a zero?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 13:48:21 what u making

plane-crazy 2022-05-20 14:40:56 why wont my motorlocks work?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 14:41:45 nvm i figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 14:53:16 the hull is slowly taking shape
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 14:54:22 trying to make a t34
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 14:56:55 hull currently disfigured imo

plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:28:46 alr so if i make my nose 2 blocks wide,  how long should my nose be till the canopy
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:31:07 its an attack helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:31:18 ka 52 to be exact
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:34:16 reference and what ive made so far of the nose ( the big blocks are just for the thing to stay upright in the pic
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:35:48 how do i make it smoother when its 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:36:10 without adding 50 petatons of motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:37:17 i understand motorlocks but i dont need it to be a superrealism this time
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:44:32 alr ive accepted defeat with the half blocks and made it 3 normal ones
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:50:57 screw it imma make 1 wide nose heli
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:01:33 how should i build the canopy now
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:03:54 yis
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:05:54 and there are even lower poly ones

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:18:57 i think i need to extend the canopy a lil bit more
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:22:35 it looks ok now
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:39:28 dis look good so far or am i making it too long
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:40:11 thought so
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:46:41 alr this is a shorter one
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:47:58 overlay is also like 89%
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 14:48:01 good enough
