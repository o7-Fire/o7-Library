creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:39:51 W h e n s l o w m o d e i s o n. It looks good Carlito. I cant believe I had to wait 2 minutes to say that
creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:44:44 intake doesnt look finished
creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:56:50 it looks good, only thing i would mention is the intake, but i think your still working in that area, right?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 23:02:20 no, its from the more recent show, called Enterprise lol
creations-chat 2021-01-31 23:16:22 no, the show is called Enterprise. It basically the story of the first ever warp 5 human starship. its the Enterprise NX 01
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:05:07 There are a lot of people with high taste, as well as a lot of salty people that downvote bc their build got downvoted
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:08:53 Yeah, a lot of the voters are not fair
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:12:24 Thats a pretty standard engine, and I can see people can make some pretty dirty stuff with that
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 01:31:43 anyone have some tips for making a hover engine for a jet?
general 2021-02-02 01:33:33 anyone have tips for making a hover engine for a jet?
general 2021-02-02 01:36:41 y e s
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 01:59:57 i meant a hover drive -_-
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:17:01 show us it in build mode, on flight mode looks like a thrown together pvp thing. prove to us it took an hour. bc that doesnt look like it
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:52:14 100 dollars to each of us?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:21:04 60 40 60 works well i think
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:21:39 just so you see it, 40 60 40 or 60 40 60 works as a dark green
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:43:20 ik
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:45:23 My goal was to make a big version of it, since I already had a small version of it, and I wanted to have it as practice for more motor locked things. Yeah the front looks a little weird, had to fit the 3 blades motors in.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:48:41 Ok savllen, and wdym D1n0. I wanted to make them thicker than 1 wing panel. responding here bc slow chat is so dumb. I see what you mean, ill add some shape to them
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:53:37 lol are you out of space for more? Instead of waiting you can just edit the msg
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:56:21 is there a certain jet its made after, or custom?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:11:25 Fonnex, how many blocks is that? Can we see it in build mode? With slow chat just edit your new msg into the old one. Otherwise you need to wait for 2 minutes.

creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:28:53 I did my best to with motor lock, but to make the 3 blades I needed the gap. Ive gotten suggestions to make the cockpit better, and I will. I did my best to minimize that gap

creations-chat 2021-02-05 17:15:18 if you look up from: pyro in:creations. I see a lot of B25J that are the same, with minor adjustments and diff paintjobs

creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:25:51 Yes, but motor lock takes space. Which you might not have if your build is big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:48:28 Which takes up even more space, leaving less space for the motorlocked parts of the iron cross
creations-chat 2021-03-22 20:05:47 Good to know, now i know that its not that big
creations-chat 2021-03-23 13:37:47 <@456226577798135808> you gonna get a warning for that image. Its a low effort build, and a reference picture

creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:03:45 <@!642524491439800330> did you add retractable landing gear to your stuka by any chance?
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:06:23 Because uh, hate to break it to ya, but stukas had fixed landing gear. They dont retract inwards, and they stay fully out.
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:32:28 Its alr, I can see how they may look like that. At least its a pretty easy fix for you, if you wanted you could just remove the motor and youd be set

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:45:14 See how its in a pattern, with each color together?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:45:24 doesnt have to be that pattern
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:45:27 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:45:35 but darker green with more brown
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:45:56 im saying the color needed more brown color to the green
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:46:17 like mixing a bit of brown paint into more green paint
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:47:36 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:47:50 135, 106, 5

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:52:26 use this
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:58:06 not really
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:58:12 the patterns arent there
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:58:22 also the brown was only on the wingtips
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:58:47 wait nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:59:01 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:59:17 ok then you have a bit too much lime green
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 16:59:28 maybe make that a bit darker then its better
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:00:52 folding??
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:01:14 what is the width in between the sections
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:01:21 are you folding down, or from the side
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:03 18? thats a lot
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:04 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:19 i would say the best way to figure it out is to experiment
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:39 start by connecting the two with cameras, and then either have a motor 2 with servo on
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:45 or a motor 1 locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:49 but powered
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:02:57 put the motor in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:03:05 camera becomes invisible when in flight mode
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:03:15 so its just an invisible connector piece
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:03:33 so you dont have a lot of awkward stuff hanging off your build
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:04:35 a lot better yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:04:45 you could use either
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:04:59 you may want to work on the patterns a bit more
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:05:11 im seeing a lot of color blocks just by themselves
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:05:47 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/770074294620389436 this is a good example for patterns
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:06:07 yes for motor 1, unless you want your build to unfold while in the water
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:06:26 but make sure that it is still powered
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:06:30 just 1
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:07:26 yes but you will get  a lot of downvotes from your paint if you leave it without a pattern
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:07:36 the C-130s in vietnam had patterns
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:07:45 im not sure what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:08:01 but if your working on the paint now you should finish the paint
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:08:15 thats what i was saying
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:08:19 he needs a pattern
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:08:25 like the HOF Vulcan
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:08:45 you only need one motor
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:09:16 and that is for motor 2 most often, with reversing controls
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:09:23 like for custom control panels
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:14:08 it doesnt need to
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 17:14:12 you can if you want
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:37:13 the patterns are a lot better, you may want to work on the brown though
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:37:24 too red
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:37:31 stands out too much
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:37:44 but thats a good green you have
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:38:19 ye me too
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:39:42 more darker
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 18:45:52 yeah a lot darker
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:36:10 well you need a lot of tnt
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:36:13 and a pipe
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:36:35 also a fuse

creations-chat 2021-08-19 15:59:57 <@!691238351767863357> Most often the cannons on the stuka were located on the fixed gear legs, or close by them.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:05:29 then why add the airbrakes <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:11:15 so your saying your going for realism but at the same time your not
