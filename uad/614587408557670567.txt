general 2021-03-15 09:00:46 if you are using a system with an Intel Four-core processor and Intel HD-Graphics GPU, ofc it's gonna be crappy
general 2021-03-15 09:01:57 Now, in comparison, if you use a system with either a mid-end Intel 8 core processor, like a Intel I7 6700K, combined with an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti, its rather good.
general 2021-03-15 09:03:00 oh and 8GB ram is pure minimum these days, recommended is 16 nowadays.
general 2021-03-15 09:03:18 XD got 32GB aswell
