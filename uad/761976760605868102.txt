general 2022-08-05 07:48:13 God Damit
general 2022-08-05 07:48:20 I worked so hard on this thing
general 2022-08-05 07:48:23 okay let me explain
general 2022-08-05 07:48:45 I joined this server to post some stuff on a steamship I built a long time ago
general 2022-08-05 07:48:51 I literally just lost it
general 2022-08-05 07:48:55 the save messed up
general 2022-08-05 07:48:59 it’s fine
general 2022-08-05 07:49:02 goen*
general 2022-08-05 07:49:16 LITERALLY A REMAKE OF A OLD VERSION FOR THE SAME REASON
general 2022-08-05 07:49:24 7000 PARTS AND OVER MAN
general 2022-08-05 07:49:36 YOU GOTTA BE SERIOUS
general 2022-08-05 07:49:53 I’ll post some pictures rq
general 2022-08-05 07:49:57 in creations
general 2022-08-05 07:56:30 Where’s something I can post images?
general 2022-08-05 07:56:36 It won’t let me in the creations
help 2022-08-05 07:57:50 Just posting it because I can’t anywhere else for some reason, Here’s something I built: 1875 steamship “SS Calypso” and i literally just lost it to either a save glitch or me being stupid and saving one thing to something else with is probably what happened
help 2022-08-05 07:58:14 this is already a rebuild of something I’ve made before and I’ve put so much work into it
general 2022-08-05 07:58:39 just look in the help thing
general 2022-08-05 07:58:43 help channel
general 2022-08-05 07:58:46 whatever you call it
help 2022-08-05 07:59:15 The interior was a lot better then what you can see on the outside
general 2022-08-05 08:00:47 bruh I’m not in the mood to joke rn
general 2022-08-05 08:00:54 I’m sorry but it just sucks man
general 2022-08-05 08:00:58 I worked so hard on this
general 2022-08-05 08:01:28 wdym?
general 2022-08-05 08:01:45 yes I swear to god it was 7000 and most of the hull where beams
general 2022-08-05 08:02:00 there’s was a massive amount of detail onboard
general 2022-08-05 08:03:01 wdym?
general 2022-08-05 08:03:39 I know it can but it’s just emotionally draining when you have built this thing 2 times and you have to do it again
general 2022-08-05 08:07:26 Is there any way other then to use the undo thing to get a previously saved thing back if you saved over it or the file messed up?
general 2022-08-05 08:10:05 I’m not anymore
general 2022-08-05 08:12:14 Yeah your right because I remember everything about it but like
general 2022-08-05 08:12:27 I’ve done it twice so it’s gonna kinda be emotionally draining to do it all over again
general 2022-08-05 08:14:15 But yeah I guess I’ll just rebuild it from here
general 2022-08-05 08:14:20 not much to do
general 2022-08-05 08:16:05 Idk if this makes any sense and ik it sounds dumb but the reason I don’t use wedges is because before I built in pc I built in a game that was primarily a ship game and id build all my old ships with blocky bows and everything else be smoothed and what not
general 2022-08-05 08:16:24 it sounds dumb because it is but you know
general 2022-08-05 08:17:19 Ever heard of Build a ship to survivors island?
general 2022-08-05 08:17:23 probably not
general 2022-08-05 08:17:31 but that’s a game I use to build in
help 2022-08-05 08:20:06 those are old and saved only my phone
help 2022-08-05 08:20:10 so I used them
help 2022-08-05 08:20:24 I can’t take a screenshot of anything anymore because there’s nothing to take a screenshot of
help 2022-08-05 08:25:42 well i guess there's only one thing left to do
