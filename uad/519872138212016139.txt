general 2021-05-02 06:27:21 I NEED AN ANSWER

What would happen if you taped a piece of bread with butter on one side to a cat, where the side of the bread with the butter is facing the opposite way to the cats legs, and you dropped the cat?

Iâ€™m either onto something or on something
general 2021-05-02 06:28:35 But would the cat land on its feet or would the buttered bread cause the cat to land on its back and the buttered side of the bread to hit the ground?
help 2021-05-12 21:27:43 Can somebody tell me what plane this is? (Exact model) ping me if u have answer
