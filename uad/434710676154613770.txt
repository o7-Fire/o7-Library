The Tale of zolure (434710676154613770)
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 05:17:12 cool
general 2020-05-19 06:08:02 my brain hurts
general 2020-05-19 06:08:54 I wish I could get a rank or something at least but my brain is deaddd
creations-chat 2020-05-19 06:12:11 am I allowed to post another picture of my creation? I had a really bad shot when I first posted and couldn't select multiple pics for some reason

creations-chat 2021-01-02 19:51:26 i wanted it to have three blades like the real one i know it looks weird but i didn't know what else to do sorry
creations-chat 2021-01-02 19:56:25 i have no idea how to motorlock i feel like if i tried to fit some in it i would have to re build the entire thing
creations-chat 2021-01-02 20:05:08 the only three prop tut I found looks like it would be too big and clunky idk but anyways thank you for the feedback I'm probably not changing it I'm happy with it the way it is
creations-chat 2021-01-02 20:18:42 i know this but i do not know how to make a 3 blade prop can you dm me or something what you mean because the only tutorial i can find on youtube is too thick and i want to keep my plane's sort of natural slender look
creations-chat 2021-01-05 22:25:43 i experimented with some camera lock thingy on the prop to see if it would look better than the tiny ugly 3 blade prop and i personally like it better but sadly 4 blades, i also changed the engines to hover drives which i also like better, it flies slightly faster and lands smoother
creations-chat 2021-01-06 00:30:16 filled the gap in cockpit window with camera lock, i think i like camera lock now, i'm gonna use it more often, i understand it better than motor lock and it's invisible and doesn't add weight (as far as i know?)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 00:32:35 i just thought it didn't, bc when i added some off to the side it didn't unbalance the plane at all

creations-chat 2021-01-08 07:13:19 bruh same plane
creations-chat 2021-01-10 21:24:52 anyone know how i could make the gear slightly bigger and angled forward?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 22:10:00 ehhhy if i moved it a block forward it would be in front of the wings, i need to angle them, not move them, also bigger, but idk if that's even possible
creations-chat 2021-01-21 19:10:44 uh i'm sorry i don't want to spam the creations channel with images, how do i upload multiple images at once? it doesn't let me select multiple (oh ok thank you)
creations-chat 2021-01-27 18:54:42 thank you guys i can't wait to find a godzilla or other kaiju to try and battle oh god i can't even image the laagg that would cause
creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:06:19 i'm thinking of doing that when it reaches the score (i'm tryna make them do the thing from that image rn)
creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:54:05 ik the wings are too small i had to fit as much as i could in the little plot box without too much folding
creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:56:20 almost forgot to send this <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-01-27 20:04:05 i have read how to do it like 5 times in a row and i am still confused and scared and shy o my god do i ping an admin or not ppl keep saying do it and don't do it
creations-chat 2021-01-27 20:11:28 yess
creations-chat 2021-01-28 00:06:16 thank youu
creations-chat 2021-01-28 04:37:50 <@!587047177558163466> around 2-3 days, i started around the middle of the first day, worked on it from around 1 PM the next day all the way to 6 AM the last day (whatt?? i thought i was more of a slow builder, i guess that was kinda fast though for something like that, it is partially hollow inside to try and reduce lag and weight(also i bet it's a little smaller than 1:1 scale especially the wings(w a i t let me see if i can measure it to actually know if it is or not)))
creations-chat 2021-01-28 04:57:37 stop bruh at least get better angles and crop the images
creations-chat 2021-01-28 05:54:26 <@!334903399709671445> ooooo i love i love dragonssss that looks good but a little plain in the mouth shape
creations-chat 2021-01-28 05:59:35 wdym call staff, not actually call them, right? just dm? if so then i already did, they do the thing in 24 hours so tomorrow i will have to see if it's there i think idk how it works yet
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:02:05 ðŸ˜”
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:28:13 bro i don't post a lot why would that matter
general 2021-01-28 06:46:08 A
general 2021-01-28 06:46:21 i swear
general 2021-01-28 06:46:25 this is why i
general 2021-01-28 06:46:39 try not to talk in massive servers
creations-chat 2021-01-28 18:56:08 does anyone have suggestions for the ghidorah, i'm trying to add a gravity beam function and thinking about giving the legs more movable joints
creations-chat 2021-01-28 21:38:49 smoothed out the legs and random blocky parts around the body that I could, fixed the paint in some places, wings open further without showing huge gaps
creations-chat 2021-01-28 21:40:48 what happened why did they get banned they seemed like a really good builder
creations-chat 2021-01-28 21:43:30 <@!428029067678318602> no it's a cicada
general 2021-01-28 21:46:25 i can't believe i complimented him i said his dragon head looked good
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 22:30:51 sad moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 22:31:00 it is oK
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 22:37:52 stopp it's ok i don't want anyone getting warned or banned for breaking any rules bc of it
creations-chat 2021-01-29 00:16:40 yes epic (nope didn't get into hof)
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 00:24:22 what happened to "time played"
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 00:24:59 i was just concerned
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 00:25:45 idk it resets every time i rejoin a game
creations-chat 2021-03-04 20:27:38 i updated ghidorah like a month ago i forgot to post
creations-chat 2021-03-04 20:59:51 yes it flies, and it's mostly controlled but very very slow bc lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 17:40:30 oh my god my ghidorah can actually fly now
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:16:38 i did ask for hof, but it lost
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:20:22 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:22:29 there is no way in hell i'd get something that large to fly with only wings, so yeah it uses a lot of rocket engines
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:28:11 friend me, join me, and tell me how i'd do something like that with the limited 1000 torque this game has, the poor motors can barely even lift the wings, let alone push ghidorah through the air on their own
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:36:23 actually nvm i have a much smaller wyvern that flies only using wings, i know how it works, but i would rather be slightly less cool than i would be if i made my brain implode trying to do the same on a much larger scale. look, even if i did make it fly using only wings it would be way too laggy to be useful, i don't have a super computer
creations-chat 2021-10-14 18:21:50 me
creations-chat 2021-10-14 18:25:02 trying to see if it can get that many votes again Yes it fly
where
maybe i'll make a video of it fighting random kaijus on yt if i can
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:46:08 oh come on i rebuilt the front over 3 different times man this is the best front i can get
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:50:25 help
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:58:40 ok i made that weird area near the bottom smoother
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:01:49 the red? or the entire stripe? to what? i like it like that
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:05:46 this is what it looks like when i remove the stripe
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:10:56 also this is the paint job i based mine off of
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:22:05 should i figure out how to remove the extra line there or keep it <@!434087698316263435> (it looks like it's smirking)
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:30:05 ohh here we go that was easier than i thought (looks better actually, thank you for the feedback)
creations-chat 2021-10-25 20:27:37 motor lock and camera lock
creations-chat 2021-12-24 14:11:57 in case you were being serious, those are not shaders, i edited that image, there's some unedited pictures in my post too

also i'll get around to filling in more gaps, if i fill too much it might jam the movements
creations-chat 2022-01-25 02:33:12 yeah can you both just stop
creations-chat 2022-04-20 17:14:48 do you think i'm gonna keep the rockets like that
