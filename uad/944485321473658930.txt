general 2022-07-23 05:28:24 Is huge rocket more powerful than super rocket engine?
general 2022-07-23 05:30:53 Thanks
general 2022-07-23 08:09:36 Is it possibly to make the hover thrusters go higher from the ground?
general 2022-07-23 21:20:43 Is it possible to make hover thrusters go higher
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 21:22:44 Is it possible to have hover thrusters go higher / have more power
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:00:56 For some reason when I use propellers to move forward on a perfectly symmetrical build it tilts up
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:02:57 Let me send a screenshot real quick
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:03:33 Nvm cant
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:03:51 Its the structure of a plus, and there are propellers on each line
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:04:29 It is a + of blocks with propellers at the ends
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:04:41 Normal blocks it does have wing panels in other areas though
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:04:48 Could I Dm you the screenshot?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 12:12:53 Is it a bug if a missile with 'on impact' tnt collides with a target and still does no damage
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 12:13:17 idk if its a bug or I somehow messed up the missile
help 2022-08-18 22:14:25 How do I stabilize a build that keeps shaking when going higher speeds
help 2022-08-18 22:14:35 Is there a way to keep the high speeds but reduce the shaking?
help 2022-08-18 22:17:53 A single wing panel or a 1x4?
help 2022-08-18 22:20:31 It works
help 2022-08-18 22:20:34 Thanks for the help
help 2022-08-19 21:11:40 How do I fix the shaking on this plane without losing more speed / mobility?
I've put wing panels in the nose, in the body itself, and wings on the middile reduce speed greatly but it doesn't help stabilize it (Using 6 hover drives)

If losing speed is required to stabilize it I will try, but want to see if there are better methods before going that route.
help 2022-08-19 21:12:23 (It might look ugly but I'm trying to get better at building plane mobility right now.)
