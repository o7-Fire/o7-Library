general 2020-04-24 10:16:17 hello
general 2020-04-24 10:16:29 where should I post the smallest plane I could make
general 2020-04-24 10:16:51 in what directions
general 2020-04-24 10:17:01 I mean dimensionally
general 2020-04-24 10:17:21 nice
general 2020-04-24 10:17:26 is there a photo
general 2020-04-24 10:24:40 mine is 7
general 2020-04-24 10:25:02 
general 2020-04-24 10:25:06 this is mine
general 2020-04-24 10:25:19 I mean 2x2x3
general 2020-04-24 10:25:43 I am going for smallest dimensions
general 2020-04-24 10:26:22 what is the plane with smallest dimensions
general 2020-04-24 10:27:05 I think mine is the most compact plane
general 2020-04-24 10:27:27 
general 2020-04-24 10:28:24 those are larger
general 2020-04-24 10:28:31 these are all larger
general 2020-04-24 10:29:02 
general 2020-04-24 10:29:16 
general 2020-04-24 10:29:27 p well actually
general 2020-04-24 10:30:37 
general 2020-04-24 10:31:10 I didn't see a 2x2x3 plane in the thing so
general 2020-04-24 10:31:17 I think that's the money
general 2020-04-24 10:31:47 I am not counting by parts
general 2020-04-24 10:31:56 how many times do i have to say this
general 2020-04-24 10:31:59 it's dimensions
general 2020-04-24 10:32:04 2x2x3
general 2020-04-24 10:33:06 welp I'm claiming the most compact plane if no one's gonna send a 2x2x3 or smaller
general 2020-04-24 10:33:23 yay
creations-chat 2020-04-24 10:43:30 most compact plane I could make, 2 long, 2 tall, 3 wide
creations-chat 2020-04-24 10:59:12 I'm sorry I didn't realize this was a contest
creations-chat 2020-04-24 10:59:40 ok and?
creations-chat 2020-04-24 10:59:45 where's the plane?
creations-chat 2020-04-24 11:00:19 exactly
creations-chat 2020-04-24 11:00:36 thanks
creations-chat 2020-04-24 11:00:55 but that's not a plane
creations-chat 2020-04-24 11:01:17 <@!278699758644887552> do you have a photo
creations-chat 2020-04-24 11:01:26 I'm talking planes also
general 2020-04-24 11:15:31 tomorrow I think I will make the Cobra from elite
