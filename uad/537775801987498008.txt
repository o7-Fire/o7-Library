general 2020-10-02 23:09:17 Players, I have a quick question to ask you, 

In a morning small writing assignment question, I was asked - "If you go to meet any musical artist, who would it be "

And I answered- I would meet Michael Jackson, Why? Actually, I don’t. I am simply
making this up for the sake of my currently failing grade within this class. However,
if I did meet Michael Jackson, I would offer him a bottle of brown skin dye.”
I am a Latin American, and fairly dark-skinned
Give your opinion.
general 2020-10-02 23:12:58 . Do you, personally, find it offensive in any manner or way?
general 2020-10-02 23:14:58 because I wish to have an idea of what an easilly offendable group of people would see of it.
general 2020-10-02 23:15:14 And due to the fact I've received a detention for it
general 2020-10-02 23:15:35 And it would be fantastic to get insight on what others believe upon it
general 2020-10-02 23:15:54 as it would allow me to formulate a better apologetic and also argumentative E-mail to defend myself.
general 2020-10-02 23:15:59 ... in his later years
general 2020-10-02 23:16:02 if you do not know
general 2020-10-02 23:16:12 He had an odd skin disorder, which made him appear white
general 2020-10-02 23:16:21 However, he, as birth. Was black.
general 2020-10-02 23:16:31 .. I'm not sure.
general 2020-10-02 23:16:51 However, please tell me in what ways you believe the comment I made is innapropiate.
general 2020-10-02 23:17:03 Be offended, it will only help me.
general 2020-10-02 23:18:07 ... I will go elsewhere, and ask the same question.
general 2021-06-28 06:30:54 
creations-chat 2021-08-02 21:54:32 That Insult hasn't got a cent of sense to it
creations-chat 2021-08-02 21:57:07 But a l r i g h t, and <@!702590900852883683> , no shit mate.


and why would I bother with a guessing game, in that case?

xd, in the case for this game, it helps. But yes, you'd be correct.

But it just ever so happened to be the version of the B-2 I had loaded up.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 22:00:41 xd, and was about to. It was a Fantastic Moment.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 22:03:07 people in <#384025409945337856> who Downvoted, your Critique?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 22:09:07 I kept the GUI so that whomever was looking at the Sreenshot could look at the Speed, and that Paired alongside the fact that I was being Chased,

I hoped, would give a tad bit of Insight of as to the Plane's Agility and Speed. 

<@!835296760649744384> As if I would bother to crop out a section of Imaging for a Discord Show-off Chat.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 22:11:47 Lad's, give me a Plane to compare it to, another B-2, and make your actual Detailed remark's of it's Shittyness.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 22:21:27 .. I've looked at some of the better Rated ones

and none of them are actually to the Correct Size Ratio., and seem too thin, and too thick, at some parts.
