general 2020-07-29 00:08:46 Ooo minecraft project I see
general 2020-07-29 00:09:35 
general 2020-07-29 00:10:01 Indeed so
general 2020-07-29 00:10:07 
general 2020-07-29 00:10:12 Lighthouse
general 2020-07-29 00:11:02 Lighthouse 2 concept
general 2020-07-29 00:12:20 Fvlvia sounds like a easy project if they allow that
general 2020-07-29 00:12:40 Creative?
general 2020-07-29 00:13:01 Hmm if you need any building advice feel free to ask
general 2020-07-29 00:13:41 Sounds great for you
general 2020-07-29 00:14:16 Also would be interesting to use solar powered redstone lamps
general 2020-07-29 00:14:26 Though highly impractical
general 2020-07-29 00:14:55 Yep
general 2020-07-29 00:15:14 Also would be interesting to see how stone bricks would be consider as
general 2020-07-29 00:15:39 Texture pack
general 2020-07-29 00:15:57 Grass blocks
general 2020-07-29 00:17:06 Also wait he could just build a giant tree and put the resort into it as it would be eco friendly ))))))
general 2020-07-29 00:17:28 Or if it requires not killing the tree just build around it
general 2020-07-29 00:17:41 Just like the ewoks
general 2020-07-29 00:21:53 But if I were to make a eco friendly resort I would have a stone brick foundation with a heavy use of wood for the main structure (spruce preferably) and make it at most 2 stories in a boxe like shape with a courtyard in the center
general 2020-07-29 00:27:03 I would say it's decent but it would be nice to have a little overhang over the beach/ocean to make yourself a "water pump" to add to the eco friendliness
general 2020-07-29 00:27:20 Or just make the resort use rainwater
general 2020-07-29 00:27:57 Also flattening the hill infront would be good
general 2020-07-29 00:46:47 Hmm it would be nice flattening the island and making it bridge from the main resort go to that island to be a form of a beach relaxation
general 2020-07-29 00:47:46 Actually if I'm not lazy enough I could just make a eco friendly resort as it might be a interesting challenge
general 2020-07-29 00:50:41 Good
