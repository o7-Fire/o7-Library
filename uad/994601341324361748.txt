general 2022-07-14 12:07:48 they're both good
general 2022-07-14 12:09:22 they literally all have their counters
general 2022-07-14 12:10:13 it has no armor and its slow
general 2022-07-14 12:10:16 airplanes exist
general 2022-07-14 12:12:00 idk you get shit on by a slightly better player
general 2022-07-14 12:13:41 it is tho
general 2022-07-14 12:13:48 bro?
general 2022-07-14 12:14:00 im not
general 2022-07-14 12:14:03 but its better
general 2022-07-14 12:14:20 also thats like the only jumbo at 6.3 im pretty sure
general 2022-07-14 12:16:50 also the churchils are pretty solid when it comes to armor but its just that germans counter it <@439829923192897536>

general 2022-07-14 12:19:33 you'll still face it basically every other match
general 2022-07-14 12:20:05 pretty much all of the russian tanks at 5.0 and 5.3 destroy it
general 2022-07-14 12:21:48 everywhere
general 2022-07-14 12:24:40 would be a shame if the kv1 can also just slice through the panzer 4
general 2022-07-14 12:25:38 you cant really even angle it
general 2022-07-14 12:25:41 just shoot the side
general 2022-07-14 12:25:48 also the turret is just dogshit

general 2022-07-19 03:26:22 Nah it ain't
general 2022-07-19 03:26:39 Some aspects are bad but that applies to every game
general 2022-07-19 03:26:53 Theres a difference between a bad one and a good one
general 2022-07-19 03:27:14 L
general 2022-07-19 03:27:43 I don't care man its just that wt is better than wot in every way

general 2022-07-19 03:28:15 You can play wot im just saying its dogshit
general 2022-07-19 03:28:33 And less realistic
general 2022-07-19 03:28:58 Much more realistic than wot tho
general 2022-07-19 03:29:36 You have the choice if you want arcade realistic or sim, you cant say wot is more fun because its less realistic
general 2022-07-19 03:29:45 You can literally choose in war thunder
general 2022-07-19 03:29:58 It doesn't thats why you can play arcade
general 2022-07-19 03:30:23 Go ahead but its dogshit
