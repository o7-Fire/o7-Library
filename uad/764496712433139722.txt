general 2022-04-02 20:22:11 what is the legitimate definition of "unde"
general 2022-04-02 20:22:16 I have an understanding
general 2022-04-02 20:22:29 .....
general 2022-04-02 20:22:37 why am I being called an unde
general 2022-04-02 20:22:48 .
general 2022-04-02 20:22:52 valid.
general 2022-04-02 20:23:59 who said
general 2022-04-02 20:25:28 I'm 13 does that count as an unde
general 2022-04-02 20:25:34 I don't think so
general 2022-04-02 20:29:48 mildly suspicious but I'll allow it.
general 2022-04-02 20:32:05 I swear I thought unde was another name for new person or whitename 🙂
general 2022-04-02 20:33:26 that was funny at like 12:00 the server break, all the "undes" were complaining
general 2022-04-02 20:33:28 pure entertainment
general 2022-04-02 20:37:04 hamood
general 2022-04-02 20:38:18 so if I want motor lock I just go to pc1, build it, then load it in pC2?

general 2022-04-02 20:41:43 bc I think by now I should have some color
general 2022-04-02 20:42:59 suggestion would be to make an armor block
general 2022-04-02 20:43:07 for battleships and stuff
general 2022-04-02 20:43:19 ....
general 2022-04-02 20:43:50 like they are 3x as heavy as normal blocks but like withstand 5x the bullet damage

general 2022-04-02 20:51:07 m alright
general 2022-04-02 20:52:03 I only play on mobile 😦
general 2022-04-02 20:52:08 too poor for pc
general 2022-04-02 20:52:24 images how exactly?
general 2022-04-02 20:52:51 I played mobile for too long, no switching now.
general 2022-04-02 20:53:21 ik
general 2022-04-02 20:53:33 ik
general 2022-04-02 20:53:44 that's why motor 2 planes are oof limits for me
general 2022-04-02 20:53:45 off
general 2022-04-02 20:54:02 I'm stuck with peasant control surfaces
general 2022-04-02 20:54:07 yeah
general 2022-04-02 20:54:14 even on controls
general 2022-04-02 20:54:23 I have a ciws
general 2022-04-02 20:54:41 if u tap a control, it still counts with motor 2 as a tap
general 2022-04-02 20:54:55 I dont
general 2022-04-02 20:55:15 How do u config ur contols
general 2022-04-02 20:55:37 I'ma actually okay the game rather than talk about it
general 2022-04-02 20:55:44 play
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:22:03 yes?
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:24:13 hope it's deleted
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:26:33 can't delete it bc I'm locked from the channel
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:28:48 got it thanks, again, sincere apologies
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:30:56 where's my ban?
creations-chat 2022-04-02 22:33:44 wow I'm surprised I didn't get cancelled.
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:34:40 I have a ciws almost same design, but I locked guns in a square shape and added a motor, in the air it adds bullet spread and helps with anti-air capabilities- I recommend u try it
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:37:00 <@!550023862876635147> that's what it does and it looks pretty epic
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:39:07 it covers the air in bullets and also, you can toggle it on and off for accurate shots or anti air. Again, you can adjust motor speed for the spread, rn it's on 40 but I think 35 is better lol.
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:42:04 my ciws on my arleigh burke be like:         10/10
general 2022-04-03 00:45:30 hello
