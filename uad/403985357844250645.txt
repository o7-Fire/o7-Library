plane-crazy 2021-04-15 22:44:14 Camo needs work
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 22:44:38 I can help you find some RGB's
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 22:45:03 Okay one moment
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 22:47:58 Green: 84,89,66
Brown: 98 76 35
Tan: 172 149 104

general 2021-04-15 22:56:00 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:18:35 Looks better
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:21:08 make a 1x1 hole
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:21:34 That would be tricky
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:26:36 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:26:47 place a halfblock infront of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:27:22 i think thats what he meant because, the blades wont spin
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:27:27 if its not connected
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:29:37 Also, I noticed that your rear elevator is angled, in this Ref picture it is almost straight and somewhat behind the rotor
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:30:07 maybe move it back a block
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:30:09 or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:30:50 Oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:31:04 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:32:44 **The game is hard coded** They'd have to recode the entire game
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:34:02 What do you need help with
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:34:31 Are you using rocket propulsion?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:35:11 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:35:21 Good
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:35:22 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:36:10 you can set the motor to "lock" and it'll move the rotor half a block closer, but if you turn the motor on it'll reset the position
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:36:44 Did the same thing on my helicopter and it works fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:37:33 Is he trying to balance his boat?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:37:56 I only told you the basics, i can help you further
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:38:04 Yeah helium will help
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:38:49 Folding is simple
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:38:51 I can show you
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:39:17 or doge can
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:40:05 maybe

creations-chat 2021-07-19 08:36:39 maybe make the wheels a black color or darker.

edit: ok
creations-chat 2021-07-19 08:39:48 perhaps go darker, since the wheels match the entire hull of the tank and it doesnt provide much color contrast.
creations-chat 2021-12-10 14:43:37 Perhaps add a camouflage to it instead of it being one color.
