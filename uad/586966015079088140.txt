plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:36:52 idk how u would be able to go in and out, but it would be cool to see an inhabitable shredder bug

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:38:48 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:39:26 u could just make a tube, and put a rocket inside, and fill the rocket with explosives and attach like 20 super thrusters to the end
