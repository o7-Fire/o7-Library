plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:21:10 Motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:24:16 i wonder if anyone else has made a plane that doesn't have thrust vectoring nor the control surface blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:28:42 no, not a glider
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:28:58 it's powered but does not have thrust vectoring nor does it use the Control Surface block
general 2021-08-11 03:30:06 uhhh
general 2021-08-11 03:30:16 wait nvm wrong channel for my question
general 2021-08-11 03:30:24 maybe i should read the FAQ first
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:34:14 now i think i might be the only person who's ever made a plane that doesn't have thrust vectoring nor the use of the Control Surface block
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:34:48 i never said it wasn't powered
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:34:56 i said it doesn't have **thrust vectoring**
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:35:00 not that it has no thrust at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:37:55 motors are not engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:38:10 i specifically said it doesn't use the Control Surface blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:38:21 i never said it didn't have control surfaces entirely
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:38:26 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:38:53 btw how do i send images
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:39:21 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:40:12 they should add that in the FAQ list
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:41:05 i want to make a plane that uses air brakes
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:41:32 no i mean like the air brakes on the F-15
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:42:20 o mb

plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:49:38 i personally prefer custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:58:12 quick question
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:58:29 is there a way to make a Motor 2 act like a control surface's automatic settings
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:59:03 ok

a summary of the most recent video in <#537387160261885962>
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:11:28 ...is a non-toxic metal that can be melted from the warmth of your hand, making it fun to play with but also very messy when not contained
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:11:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:12:11 it murders aluminum (aluminium) instead

general 2021-09-06 06:36:44 that plane in <#537387160261885962> looks more like a combination of F-35 and F-16XL
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:37:32 the plane in <#537387160261885962> looks more like a combination of F-35 and F-16XL
general 2021-09-06 06:38:45 could this be Aeronautica by any chance
general 2021-09-06 06:38:59 figured
general 2021-09-06 06:39:09 looked like Neo Warfare X, but i could tell it wasn't the same
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:40:31 i thought those were called cranked-arrow wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:40:44 similar to delta wings but they have different wingtips
