plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:35:54 its just two belts and slipping parts lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:36:23 OOF
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:36:43 <@!723333098036527124> bruh where is the tension pulley
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:36:48 all of that is just rigid
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:37:21 <@!511559470376026135> actually it can lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:37:53 https://gyazo.com/3871be52eb8f48b9245a53d412d0515e
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:37:57 behold
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:00 the thing going backwards
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:15 what thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:16 i must see
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:34 bruh walkers
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:36 are a different kind of mess
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:38:55 thats a very primitive walker
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:39:06 <@!723333098036527124> thats what i meant to say
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:39:11 use suspension instead of the motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:39:14 the tension helps the belt
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:39:35 kinda like this dumb thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:39:50 
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:40:06 oh sick
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:40:22 i thought of using wedges but if the belt is barely even loose it can slip off at the right angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:40:25 if you're going fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:41:49 i also dont like how it takes a second for the belt to catch up with the motor but i guess thats fine? https://gyazo.com/cd17e6a3a70053ebf6ad713007d51bd4
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:44:08 <@!723333098036527124> bRUH
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:44:40 make the cylinders more rigid? like instead of using >3x3 i assume< try using uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:44:56 something like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:05 but more efficient <@!723333098036527124>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:23 i mean try them for the belt
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:26 idk if it will work
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:29 i havent tried myself
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:33 but i mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:38 point parts + chain gaps
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:41 i would assume grip
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:45:58 yeah <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:47:08 <@!500136411610218496> several ways
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:47:18 advanced boys motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:47:22 but boys like me who dont know motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:47:26 use loose parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:48:05 but if you dont advanced boy motorlock then you get shitty inefficient engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:48:06 https://gyazo.com/8bf412de8a907153c838ad04c50e3fcf
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:48:25 like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:48:27 abomination
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:50:45 how fast do your pistons travel at max speed? <@!723333098036527124>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:52:50 yo
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:03 now make a transmission
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:12 yeah same
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:13 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:21 i got about to the flywheel and belts for it and was like
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:27 "now how do i make a transmission"
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:53:36 and got so confused i just deleted it all and built a tank instead
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:55:34 not if we make a 4 speed automatic transmission
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:55:35 >:)
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:55:47 it just has to be timed like hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:55:48 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:56:01 computers, or perfect timing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:56:58 <@!723333098036527124> all we need is a planetary gearset, hydraulic controls, and a torque convertor.
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:57:27 plus the first automatic transmission was made in 1921 what computer was alive then for that lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:59:12 the first person to make a full 4-speed transmission in plane crazy and present it, i might just shit myself
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:59:20 **automatic**
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:00:25 a manual full sized transmission? gl doing it with normal gravity
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:00:40 IDK MAN
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:00:54 yall make tanks by stacking motors 27 stories tall how do you do that <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:01:45 actually brushless would be more impressive
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:01:57 but do
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:02:29 <@!723333098036527124> theoretically yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:02:36 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:02:36 in a perfect atmosphere or no gravity
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:02 harder challenge
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:11 make a transmission without motor lock <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:50 ?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:52 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:03:59 that was dumb
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:04:07 oh-
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:04:08 thats good news
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:04:58 who needs a crankshaft? just fill it up with oil and send it on its way
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:16 make it metal
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:17 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:23 metal crankshaft = better
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:29 it may weigh more but its worth
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:49 by my experience yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:05:53 either that or im tripping
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:07:03 F
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:08:53 i like how my bottom wheels dont have proper suspension but they still offroad just fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:10:45 uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:10:46 
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:11:23 UH OH
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:11:24 
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:14:18 eh at first i was like "oh cool i can make planes"
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:14:25 and then when i saw what i could really do
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:14:38 i started applying knowledge of real life mechanics to the game and
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:14:45 engines and belts and other weird things came out of it
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:15:14 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:15:20 <@!340543153922768906> thats amazing

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:48:03 whoever said 1x1 treads cannot exist
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:48:04 false
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:48:12 we are making progress
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:51:23 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:51:38 i have 0 knowledge of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:51:43 rope treads are the next best solution
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:51:54 not true 1x1
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:53:38 1 wide
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:53:39 1 tall
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:53:43 thats the standard im looking for

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:27:43 only took me 4 hours of procrasinating, fine tuning springs, and making pistons move to specific lengths
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:28:00 i could only make the rope thicker, if i made the tension any higher on the rope it would snap
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:28:21 so this was a lot of little bullshit for a meme <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:28:31 honestly a little spite too
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:28:41 someone said "rope tracks cant be done" or they're too ineffecient

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:40:24 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:40:36 it costs a solid $750 for a decent pc here, like the one im on
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:40:46 and around $5,000 to buy a high end pc
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:40:58 big jump
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:41:16 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:41:21 i7 paired with a 1070 isnt low end to me
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:41:46 thats the price lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:42:04 max spent on this build $820
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:42:13 a low end pc for me would be a $250 one :think:
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:42:18 like
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:42:19 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:42:28 lol

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:43:00 a nice optiplex with a beefy i5-5800 processor slapped with a 1050TI would definitely carry you
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:43:03 for under 300
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:43:07 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:44:11 you can really skimp on how cheap you build your pc for its preformance output lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:44:20 plus overclocking is a thing so thats a whole 'nother can of worms
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:44:43 it may not be able to live long but it can definitely preform
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:44:50 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 06:45:21 LOL

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 09:05:33 look bro preformance comes at a price <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 09:06:01 shitty app or not though thats some decent curving
general 2021-02-26 09:22:22 when you could trade ticks for bobux
general 2021-02-26 09:22:51 then roblox realized the potential profit loss <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-02-26 09:23:12 "free" games are hard to make
general 2021-02-26 09:23:26 plus roblox is a creator platform so gotta make money somehow
general 2021-02-26 09:23:41 well they make our hosts look beautiful
general 2021-02-26 09:23:44 so we pay them for that
general 2021-02-26 09:24:04 our beautiful hosts
general 2021-02-26 09:24:21 plus like
general 2021-02-26 09:24:30 the whole trading market
general 2021-02-26 09:24:42 idk shit about roblox trading but apparently its profitable as hell
general 2021-02-26 09:25:21 limiteds.
general 2021-02-26 09:25:48 lol funny thing when half the ticket items from before 2013 where made limited
general 2021-02-26 09:26:04 like the shaggy, kuddle-e-koala hat, and other things
general 2021-02-26 09:26:43 i remember buying that damn travelers katana pack for 75 robux and now its worth $11.26 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-02-26 09:27:16 i remember buying this for 2000 robux <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-02-26 09:27:51 limiteds are odd
general 2021-02-26 09:28:00 its literally a gamble of "whats popular today"
general 2021-02-26 09:28:17 which changes ***constantly***
general 2021-02-26 09:29:23 nothing gets better than when someone buys a limited, doesnt like it, and then sells it for 1 robux completely throwing off the whole rap of the item <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-02-26 09:30:24 i was just thinking that lmao
general 2021-02-26 09:30:30 if someone were spiteful enough they could say
general 2021-02-26 09:30:46 buy a couple dominus(s) and then sell them for 100 robux each
general 2021-02-26 09:30:57 completely throw the robux value market into shambles
general 2021-02-26 09:31:01 1.
general 2021-02-26 09:31:03 1 bobux.
general 2021-02-26 09:31:25 no seriously
general 2021-02-26 09:31:34 doing the math if we like
general 2021-02-26 09:31:47 gathered around 30 million robux in limited
general 2021-02-26 09:31:54 we could crash the entire roblox economy
general 2021-02-26 09:32:17 bruh this is slowly become the wallstreetbets of roblox
general 2021-02-26 09:37:19 so taking the general idea of how much profit roblox has made >which is about  $2.29B USD< we can assume that if 25% of that is actual purchase of robux then we have about $574M USD of robux sitting around, so shit you not if we collectively could funnel out a million or >say 100 dollars by each person, i know, its a long shot, but thats only 10,000 people and i definitely know theres several of people on roblox that would be willing to do this< we could totally crash the market B)
general 2021-02-26 09:37:54 roblox rich as fuck
general 2021-02-26 09:38:00 everyone makes fun of roblox lol
general 2021-02-26 09:38:03 but its rich
general 2021-02-26 09:38:12 the community is actually richer than the organization
general 2021-02-26 09:38:21 i wrote that wrong as hell
general 2021-02-26 09:38:26 fuck you read it ðŸ”«
general 2021-02-26 09:39:02 at 100 dollars each that would be 10,000 people
general 2021-02-26 09:39:11 and roblox definitely would have that amount of people willing to shit on it
general 2021-02-26 09:39:21 nah
general 2021-02-26 09:39:23 lol
general 2021-02-26 09:39:23 just talking about it
general 2021-02-26 09:39:40 we dont have a million dollars of united states currency to throw away on a big lol
general 2021-02-26 09:39:53 ^
general 2021-02-26 09:40:32 were pulling a reddit but its roblox and not the american stock market
general 2021-02-26 09:41:18 if i math'd right out of complete theoretical assumption
general 2021-02-26 09:41:40 there should be like $574 million US dollars of robux in current circulation
general 2021-02-26 09:42:35 maybe they will stop being such a greedy company lol
general 2021-02-26 09:42:41 the price of robux is outrageous
general 2021-02-26 09:42:44 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-02-26 09:43:03 roblox is cool tho
general 2021-02-26 09:43:09 no
general 2021-02-26 09:43:18 not the last time i checked lol
general 2021-02-26 09:43:31 it was like 85% of the actual value you can get back
general 2021-02-26 09:43:33 not 100%
general 2021-02-26 09:43:34 yes.
general 2021-02-26 09:43:39 b
general 2021-02-26 09:43:39 theres an entire trade market
general 2021-02-26 09:44:00 nah that doesnt kill it like selling it for 1 robux
general 2021-02-26 09:44:03 where ***anyone*** can get it
general 2021-02-26 09:44:24 which also means
general 2021-02-26 09:44:34 we could buy it on a non-premium account and then get it banned <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
general 2021-02-26 09:46:17 if we collectively could funnel out a million or >say 100 dollars by each person, i know, its a long shot, but thats only 10,000 people and i definitely know theres several of people on roblox that would be willing to do this< we could then funnel out that money into the limited market, which we then buy high priced items that are currently at their peak RAP period, sell it for 1 robux to a non-premium account, and get it banned <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
general 2021-02-26 09:46:47 completely shitting out that indefinite amount of robux in the market as if it where nothing
general 2021-02-26 09:46:50 or hell if we wanted to make it worse
general 2021-02-26 09:47:01 we could buy it at its LOWEST period and then sell it at peak and destroy more
general 2021-02-26 09:47:03 ðŸ‘Œ
general 2021-02-26 09:47:59 or we could just artificially raise the RAP price of really shitty limiteds and crash the trade market
general 2021-02-26 09:48:09 that would probably be easier
general 2021-02-26 09:48:49 giving that we still had the million, we could buy a hellacious amount of certain shitty limiteds across different accounts, and then raise the price to an outrageous amount by killing out the under-cutter
general 2021-02-26 09:49:27 no
general 2021-02-26 09:49:37 honestly i just like world history
general 2021-02-26 09:49:42 and chaos

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 15:28:06 a v8 is literally just a v version of this
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 15:28:43 Though id recommend something smaller, this thing has a tendency to lag servers
