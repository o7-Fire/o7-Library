creations-chat 2021-11-21 00:48:53 you can improve it a lil to be honest :l (or at least change the color lol)
creations-chat 2021-11-21 00:55:01 replace those x2 and x3 edge's and add some more semi-edges like you started to and mhhhhhhhhh abt the color depends if you wanna do a cruiser ship or battleship bc seeing the actual full ship would be better xd

plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:16:32 I got a question, I came back to pl after a while and all my helium builds are like 2 times lighter, were the helium blocks buffed? or its just me?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:19:14 silent buff? glitch/bug?

general 2023-01-01 07:24:48 some bleach is also a good answer
general 2023-01-01 07:27:59 you posted more of that thing than the amount of messages i posted in 2 years on this server
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 11:41:29 should I keep building or wait untill PL2 come out? because if too many things will be changed, it'll just feel like a waste of time to rebuild everything
