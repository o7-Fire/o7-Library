bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:13:44 not the usual jet pack glitch. so i somehow had 2 glitched jetpacks on so i couldn't remove them and even when i spawned they wouldn't come off. and then i put on a normal one and anytime i get near the ground it would shake me and then fling me at over a billion speed
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:22:37 also another glitch i have. one of my builds breaks the game, its just a regular ship and it glitches out randomly, making me unable to chat, unable to despawn, and unable to control anything. i have to re-open Roblox just to play
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:27:26 bruh then why does it only happen to that build?
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:30:37 its not that big only like 3k blocks i have builds above 8k that are perfectly fine
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:33:27 it has a lot of pistons and motor 2s but the motor 2 dont get glitched into anything
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:34:26 oh i would never use a half piston
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:37:31 nope
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:37:40 still glitchy as hell
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:40:34 it still glitches a lot but after about a min of glitching it goes to normal and is locked fine but i still cant chat or control or despawn
bug-reports 2023-05-08 20:10:51 Nope it was totally accidental
