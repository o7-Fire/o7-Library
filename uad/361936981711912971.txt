plane-crazy 2021-06-03 11:04:54 I have a question. Sometimes I see people playing and they have like 40 cameras on their build. What are they used for? I try asking players but they are always very toxic and never answer my questions.
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 11:09:37 oh! I never knew you could do cameralocking
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 11:09:39 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 11:11:10 the only thing this game needs is a public workshop like besiege and it would be perfect
