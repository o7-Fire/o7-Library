general 2022-06-24 15:28:53 yea ik ):
general 2022-06-24 15:30:22 how do i acquire this EXPERT rank?
general 2022-06-24 15:31:11 i have a pretty sick space station 3000+ blocks is that good enough?
general 2022-06-24 15:31:57 its not a wip i finished it just yesterday
general 2022-06-24 15:32:10 ok one sec
general 2022-06-24 15:36:14 i posted it!
general 2022-06-24 15:36:28 its ok if u down vote it kinda sucks
general 2022-06-24 15:38:06 well each block is 1x1 and there are 2 layers
general 2022-06-24 15:38:17 one layer is for outside coler and materal
general 2022-06-24 15:38:25 and the inside blocks are for.. ya know
general 2022-06-24 15:38:57 no, because if you shoot a beam it will all disapear but with blocks
general 2022-06-24 15:39:06 you have to shoot out one block at a time
general 2022-06-24 15:40:23 i used anchor blocks to keep it from flipping also without the lag would make the game unplayable
general 2022-06-24 15:40:39 ik its kinda cheating
general 2022-06-24 15:41:01 alright..
general 2022-06-24 15:41:10 sounds hard ):

general 2022-08-20 15:47:35 seems hard.......
general 2022-08-20 15:47:56 hmm
general 2022-08-20 15:48:05 is there also a way to make it compact?
general 2022-08-20 15:48:27 i see
general 2022-08-20 15:49:10 i think i can just use spinning arms wil trails or smoke pipes
general 2022-08-20 15:49:27 but that makes it harder to compact it
general 2022-08-20 15:49:46 also btw has anyone made a nuke yet?
general 2022-08-21 22:56:53 tired shredder glitch today, quit after 3 minutes its boring as heck
