general 2021-02-04 06:06:30 tbh, i just joined the discord server for 2 things
general 2021-02-04 06:06:42 1. rules
2. the amazing builds
general 2021-02-04 06:07:33 i just checked on rules because a kid keeps telling me to stop using a shredder. (its not even a shredder)
general 2021-02-04 06:09:35 its not even a shredder. its just a flying ship with 4 cutters
general 2021-02-04 06:09:46 i was just cutting their wings so that they'd fall

general 2021-04-01 05:09:42 eh, dream is a respectable minecraft player. He is good, but not the best. Remember how techno beat him at pvp.
