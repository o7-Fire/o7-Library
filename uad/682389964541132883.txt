creations-chat 2020-04-15 13:54:29 here is my creation, a giant plane that is impractical in every single way....
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 13:57:28 i managed to destroy my computers FPS by ramming a small blimp into the propellers of the flying island
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 13:57:39 it was worth it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 13:57:55 yes.....
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:02:37 the thing turns like a brick, its design makes it look like a brick, and the brick has to move at 300 mph just to take off

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:01 all i did was build a rocket, when someone ran in front of me, it was game over (for me most of the time)
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 14:28:38 i was about to say, "you peaked my interest"
general 2020-04-15 14:30:27 all people care about is weight lifting, texting, crime, and building houses
general 2020-04-15 14:32:15 you do, it needs to burn
general 2020-04-15 14:34:45 you can make a documentary about this

creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:22:01 <@!670939038999511041> Now the soviets can park their nuclear weapons near the stratosphere
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 15:33:24 has anyone asked the idea of more pvp weapons (like large caliber cannons)
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 15:33:54 or autocannons
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:37:54 lemee change my statement
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:56:17 you can use hydrogen, but keep in mind of a famous indecent of 1937
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:57:02 (im not serious with this, though it would be nice to have a second alternative to helium blocks in game)
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:03:08 can we have more options on the horn, like the ablility to change what sound it produces, the pitch of the horn, and the play-speed of the horn's sound effect?
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:03:58 0-0
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:04:36 oof
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:05:23 Does it walk or does it have wheels on the bottom?
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:06:33 We must film this "baby" walking
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:07:19 Put some soft music in the background while your at it...
creations-chat 2020-04-15 16:08:53 buddy, everything you'll do is better than me, i have no skills when it comes to editing videos and whatnot
general 2020-04-20 17:26:14 looks like something out of "breaking bad"
general 2020-04-20 17:28:22 thats the description for breaking bad on google
general 2020-04-20 17:29:24 proof and profile
general 2020-04-20 17:30:39 o o f
general 2020-04-20 17:31:15 yes
general 2020-04-20 17:31:57 the only place i've gotten kicked out of was a Facebook Anti-vax group
general 2020-04-20 17:33:42 I said how their test had faults and is unreliable due to the tests being conducted a long time ago
general 2020-04-20 17:36:47 My next target, a flat earth discord server
general 2020-04-20 17:37:07 (who even came up with flat earth, i demand to know)
general 2020-09-27 17:17:18 Can i request someone's opinion on a crappy build idea?
general 2020-09-27 17:17:50 Italaian bomber: sm79
general 2020-09-27 17:20:06 I always described my brain as a "windows 95" or a "commodore 64"
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 17:27:52 My brain cannot function properly so I have to have someone decide for me: Is making the Italian SM.79 a good idea?
bug-reports 2020-11-21 23:17:14 My bug?
This man is just spamming the messages and its almost causing the server to fold in on itself
bug-reports 2020-11-21 23:20:40 More evidence
bug-reports 2020-11-22 00:00:07 cannot argue with that
bug-reports 2020-11-22 00:00:11 thanks
general 2021-10-25 13:08:04 Did anyone else get this guy "Perceus" in their DM's, or was it just me?
