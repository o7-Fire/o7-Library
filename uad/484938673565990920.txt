creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:47:58 yeah engine intakes were kind of a problem, i really hated how it look but i was too lazy to change anything because on the model it curved in(but thats kind of impossible to do so i just overcomplicated block choice)

creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:06:36 well i know how motorlocks work but im not like totally good with it, like the customs angles n stuff still havent got the hang of it
