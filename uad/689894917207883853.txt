The Tale of brambam. (689894917207883853)
creations-chat 2020-08-08 19:04:54 > <@!689894917207883853> i really like your 19th century frigate, but i just wanna give some advice so don't take this as a personal assault like a karen (idk why u would but there's always the type who does). So I'm not gonna say anything about the shape or stuff like that but what I'm talk about is colour, the black on the ship is too dark and the yellow is too light and also add a gradient to both colours. But you don't have to do this if you don't want to, as stated before I'm just giving advice or critique or whatever its called.
<@324274557965959172> yeah I was thinking sorta the same thing, it's actually navy blue, but I am considering making it lighter. Thanks for the constructive criticism anyway, I'm not a Karen dw lmao
general 2020-08-21 17:13:10 I have a suggestion! A new cover photo celebrating 60 million visits when we get there
general 2020-08-21 17:15:27 Btw how do you get a rank on this server?
general 2020-08-21 17:16:02 Righto
general 2020-08-21 17:16:09 Thanks
general 2020-08-21 17:16:38 Because I've been making accurate scales scars for a couple years. Onto my 8th generation of 4x4
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:33:34 Nah they obviously weren't appreciated
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:33:57 Lol usually I get like 40 - 50 upvotes feels weird having sudden downvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:25 The reason I upvoted is because if one single person downvotes noobs jump on the bandwagon and start doing it too
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:30 I've seen it happen to others
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:40 Didnt want it to happen to me
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:36:47 I didnt freak out bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:36:52 I dont do that
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:10 I deleted my messages because I didnt want to be involved in your childish argument anymore
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:32 I have better things to do that argue with people who clearly just want to continue an argument rather than end one
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:53 So dont @ me I've got better things to do
creations-chat 2020-08-21 20:36:20 > Bruh why dont you ask for a designer [IV] rank
<@456226577798135808> thanks bruh I didnt think to ask but I have it now
creations-chat 2020-08-21 20:39:32 Good luck with that
general 2020-08-21 20:55:20 Uh guys, how do I send a video for proof of my boat turning and floating ect?
general 2020-08-21 20:55:44 So you gotta use a computer?
general 2020-08-21 22:27:20 God block
general 2020-08-21 22:28:00 Cutter bugs/shredder missiles need to be banned lmao
general 2020-08-21 22:28:29 No no no
general 2020-08-21 22:28:38 Just the cutter blocks themselves
general 2020-08-21 22:29:16 Cutters/shredders just are too OP, I think they need to at least be tuned down
general 2020-08-21 22:29:48 Like guns take several hits to break a single block, cutters should be that way too
general 2020-08-21 22:30:24 Oh no way that's cool
general 2020-08-21 22:30:53 So cutters are essentially useless when you blacklist?
general 2020-08-21 22:31:00 <@370587359491915776> good ones
general 2020-08-21 22:31:16 Oh damn
general 2020-08-21 22:31:26 Yeah they way too op lmao
general 2020-08-21 22:32:12 Uh I do yeah but it looks pretty crap from years ago
general 2020-08-21 22:32:29 And I have the hull for an incomplete frigate which is pretty good looking
general 2020-08-21 22:32:44 You wanna join and use a cutter bug on it? Lmao
general 2020-08-21 22:33:33 Bruh I'm just gonna make my plane outta chees3
general 2020-08-21 22:33:42 That way I'll get shredded cheese
general 2020-08-21 22:33:53 Modern problems require modern solutions
general 2020-08-21 22:34:08 I'll join but I'll have to use in-game chat cant keep this open
general 2020-08-21 22:40:08 <@235207095740268545> my game crashed
general 2020-08-21 22:40:12 Lmaow
general 2020-08-21 22:41:23 Plane crazy combat ain't how it used to be
general 2020-08-21 22:41:48 I remember when I could slap a turret on my trusty ol' pickup truck and do some serious damage
general 2020-08-21 22:42:40 Now I'll have a 5000 block ship destroyed by shredders before I can fold it together
general 2020-08-21 22:45:55 Imagine if magnets had a setting that allowed them to be affected by other players blocks. You could make a floating turret orb thing surrounded in magnets, this would repel other players blocks from getting too close, preventing melee combat such as shredders. And forcing it to be ranged attacks
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:17:10 Warthog go brrr

Warthogogogogog:
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:19:45 I have to say, rn I'd agree tho
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:22:33 Ikr I also noticed that two pics could be the same thing, but if one gets a downvote, people jump on the bandwagon and all down vote. If it gets upvote then more people upvote
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:09 Most people like to follow the pack I guess rather than lead
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:27 Sorry XD
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:40 I think just for the humour it deserves an upvote
bot-central 2020-08-22 08:59:50 !rank
general 2020-08-22 16:43:36 I've noticed some people have ranks that are just a colour. How do you get these?
general 2020-08-22 16:44:23 Righto I'll work on becoming said epic
creations-chat 2020-08-23 23:49:39 Just finished a 7000+ block freighter ship, took me a week. Would appreciate some feedback!
creations-chat 2020-08-23 23:53:24 Lol 😂
creations-chat 2020-08-23 23:58:16 <@419477639229865984> thanks!
general 2020-08-24 00:14:08 <@&706009538897117185> Just wondering, the Master Shipwright X requires all that any other ship requires in terms of physical abilities, also to be over 6000 blocks. But I was wondering if it also requires at least 10 upvotes in creations? If so I've also completed this. Additionally, I was wondering if getting it into the hall of fame is something that happens automatically through earning this rank, or whether it is something that needs to be forfilled prior to earning the rank as a requirement - if so how would I do that? Thanks in advance.
general 2020-08-24 00:23:54 So what would be the easiest way for me to at least try to get into the hall of fame? If at all possible <@670939038999511041>
general 2020-08-24 00:25:43 Hmm.. honestly I've never seen a freighter
general 2020-08-24 00:25:52 Which is what I've built
general 2020-08-24 00:26:45 Its enough to easily get me Shipwright V but before apply I was curious if I could apply for Shipwright X
general 2020-08-24 00:26:55 Hmm okay
general 2020-08-24 00:27:36 I think I might have an idea but I cant say what it is.. understandably
general 2020-08-24 00:27:55 Btw my freighter is over 7000 blocks
general 2020-08-24 00:28:31 Okay
general 2020-08-24 00:28:48 I'm still surprised my little wooden boat got me 43 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-24 00:38:04 The big cheese
creations-chat 2020-08-24 00:40:14 New York should be called the big orange not the big apple
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:02:48 <@456226577798135808> Ye it's a quick and efficient way of notifying them of your post when a rank requires a certain amount of upvotes, that way they literally just click my ping and they've got proof in seconds, saving them from searching for it
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:03:05 Means I get my rank quicker, and they get to find it quicker
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:03:12 Easier for both of us
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:14 Nah I'd rather just type a word when posting, rather than post it, take a screen shot, head over to the dm, send that pic
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:33 8 characters ain't that hard
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:40 Not that time consuming to type
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:06:53 Well as I've just explained it isnt
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:07:11 Not unless you forgot to type it in the first place, in which case you're right
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:08:23 Bro, if you take screenshots find a dm, then send that quicker than typing a word when you're already typing out words in your post meaning you domt have to go anywhere, good for you. Personally my way is quicker for me
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:09:23 If your way is quicker for you good for you bro. I ain't got time to argue on a discord server about which way is quicker to notify staff of your build on a Lego game
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:11:23 Imagine trying to start an argument with someone online who you don't even know about their methods of notifying staff <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2020-08-24 03:52:24 Lol thanks, I finally got the Shipwright Expert V as a result of this, thanks a lot it's nice hearing positive feedback after a week of doing this crap 😂
creations-chat 2020-08-24 04:01:07 Glad you guys like it
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:32:59 Kinda random but ive been playing this game for over 2 years and has anyone else noticed there's a sort of barrier at 600 speed where it suddenly becomes more stable? I find below 600 your planes shape isnt too important but beyond 600 the drag drastically increases for me, meaning the shape of wings has to be realistic
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:34:38 Honestly, if you're playing pvp stay in the 500s
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:21 Yeah sure make it go as fast as you want but in pvp have like a mode for slow flight
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:25 Makes it easier to aim
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:51 My magnet jet got to near 6000 speed but then it lagged so much I didnt use it again
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:36:29 Noice
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:37:44 I my jet going 6000 speed with the entire elevators/rudder moving rather than control surfaces (realistic to modern jets) is laggy as hell
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:28 Honestly I'd rather do a slow fly by with a jet at 400 - 500 for a bomb and run attack
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:50 That's cool
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:57 If it works then it works
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:39:50 Try adding a camera on the bottom of your plane with a glass block and a text block with a + or × facing the camera for an aim
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:40:28 Can be adjusted via motor 2 to be at an angle to aim ahead of your bomb to counter for how far the bomb will fly forwards due to your planes speed
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:40:54 Sounds complex but just play around with the concept it might be easier than you think
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:41:08 Righto
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:41:36 I'm planning on creating some kind of VTOL carrier to get me the VTOL 5 rank
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:42:53 Damn, I turned my basic carrier hull into a cargo freighter
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:43:01 Lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:44:38 Imagine a VTOL carrier with onboard fighter aircraft, and turrets
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:44:45 Might make that
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:58:53 You had one job bomb
creations-chat 2020-08-24 22:26:27 <@695783576549195936> lowering the torque the really really low helps with the spazzing

creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:31:46 Imma post it
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:37:10 Thanks for the feedback! Although, every sponsor is to scale and where it is on the version that broke the record in south Africa
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:41:03 Yeah I might look into that, thanks for the feedback, although it is based on the real thing. It's a chunky square boi towards the back

creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:16:40 <@590503508667662346> looks really great in every way, however I'd say the rudder needs to be at more of an angle
creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:16:46 At the front*
creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:17:15 Because it should slope more at the front than it does at that back. Saying that, everything else is awesome!

creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:35:28 You will need video proof
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:37:19 Yup
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:39:01 Urm
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:39:03 Well
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:39:13 If it is a block it's a block
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:39:27 Sorry that's awful advice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:39:31 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:07 Yeah lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:30 Like I have a hinge on my freighter that has a removal button after its configured
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:39 I made it stay attached lol
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:42:17 Like motor 2?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:44:43 I literally have only done robloxian scale for the entire time I've been playing
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:45:05 Even though it limits you I find that better because it gives you a challenge
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:45:44 That's cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:05 But the thing I like about robloxian scale is I'm not drawing the line on what size it can be randomly, there's a point to it, it's realistic to an avatar. I then have a reason to do it at that scale
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:17 Although building any other scale is totally cool too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:50 Before the   s h r e d d e r s
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:48:02 Lmaow
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:48:16 But heres something to do on pvp:
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:49:23 Set up a disaster situation for yourself, like me on my cargo freighter with no weapons. Then think of a way to escape, like me in a lifeboat. Then try your best to put it into practice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:04 Yeah today I did two disasters
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:27 The other being an unarmed passenger turboprop with explosives under the engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:56 Problem with the freighter is no one can sink it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:51:13 Its never once been sunk in its whole existence
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:51:53 Not an amazing design or anything, it's just when you get over a certain amount of blocks people get bored lmao and go away because it takes ages
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:52:35 Cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:52:38 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:53:55 I remember like nearly 3 years ago being new to this game and me and my brother were competitive. He built a jet with 450 top speed and he was so proud of it, then I build mine which got to 560 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:07 Yeah true! No its not your pc
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:15 Every device I use does it at that speed
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:27 Unless its stable enough
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:55:03 Now my fastest jet, robloxian scale as always, goes over 5000 spees
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:55:23 Magnet engines

creations-chat 2020-08-27 06:02:49 Once again, only due to the ranking system being based off size

creations-chat 2020-11-29 04:44:35 <@712066592854245486>  you're seriously defending yourself by saying "it's not a fighter".. bruh.. so you'll upvote planes so similar to fighters that people mistake them for fighters but you wont upvote fighters? So you're not even making some loony anti-British point anymore.. that's just a bit silly.. like what even is the point of anything you're saying anymore lol
creations-chat 2020-11-29 04:46:07 Good point, I'll take that as my exit que, no point being absorbed by it lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:16:58 I just did some big brain calculations
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:17:49 Because the studs = like a couple inches it means people are way off
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:18:27 Since a standard robloxian is 5 studs tall, and can be set to higher, a stud can be roughly equal to one foot
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:19:35 I did some big brain calculations and stuff and found out that my *5000 studs per second* jet goes roughly *57 miles per hour*
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:24:06 EYYY HELLO
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:24:09 BRO
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:24:17 I didnt know you were part of this server
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:24:32 Lmaow
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:24:59 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:25:10 Look at mah text
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:25:21 Also, I may have made a catastrophic error
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:25:26 Imma redo it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:27:12 I found out the speed is 3,409.09092 miles per hour
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:27:21 So 3410mph
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:28:50 A stud is roughly a foot, so I converted that into miles (0.9469697) so that's 0.9469697 miles per second
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:28:51 Then
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:28:59 Times that by 60
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:06 For miles per minute
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:13 Which is roughly 57
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:22 Then times that by 60 for miles per hour
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:37 Which is 3410 miles per hout
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:41 *big brain*
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:29:54 Noice
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:30:23 So my Sports SUV went 1000 on the base plate
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:30:46 Which is *682mph*
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:32:13 My Smol Cessna style plane goes 136mph then
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:32:35 Anyways that's enough math, I'd rather do *m€th*
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:35:31 Lemme guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 00:35:41 *p a r a c h u t e*
bug-reports 2020-12-18 23:59:31 
bug-reports 2020-12-19 00:00:52 There isnt an "open" button for this door in the base, since it's the winter update, this should be able to open and can on PC but not mobile. I think last winter mobile "open" buttons werent a thing, so this could be why.
general 2020-12-19 23:00:50 So I just saw there was a collision option on wheels.. has that always been there? Been playing this game for like 3 years and never saw that
general 2020-12-19 23:02:02 Also about the collision feature:
general 2020-12-19 23:02:23 Collision option unselected = collision on
general 2020-12-19 23:02:28 And vice versa
general 2020-12-19 23:02:55 Should I report it as a bug?
general 2020-12-19 23:04:11 Uh
general 2020-12-19 23:04:34 My pfp is my gf with her hair in front of her face with shades and and her hands on her head

general 2020-12-19 23:05:11 Lmao
general 2020-12-19 23:05:29 Yeah, you're not the first to think it was someone taking a crap kookie
general 2020-12-19 23:05:46 I am a man of taste
general 2020-12-19 23:06:42 Well oml replying to your question about it lmao
general 2020-12-19 23:06:46 I'm*
general 2020-12-19 23:07:52 I hated collision on wheels, the angle was high because it needed to be good at turning, but it meant you could have blocks near the wheel or it would scrape the body
general 2020-12-19 23:07:59 Imma add a body kit now
general 2020-12-19 23:08:11 Flared wheel arches and that shit lol

the-dump 2020-12-21 22:21:02 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
the-dump 2020-12-21 22:21:21 Apparently so
the-dump 2020-12-21 22:45:14 And that you require their bank details to *add* money to their account
