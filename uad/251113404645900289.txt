The Tale of Rytimiscurisin (251113404645900289)
help 2018-11-21 20:04:59 http://prntscr.com/llaxva I've noticed if I hit a bump too hard in my offroader, the suspension will fully flatten and can't unflatten itself. Any way i can fix this? (Here's my suspension btw, I don't know much about it http://prntscr.com/llayg9 )

the-dump 2019-02-06 17:34:54 you just made it worse
the-dump 2019-02-08 22:36:18 so winter update doesn't get released until february and only lasts 14 days
the-dump 2019-02-08 22:36:47 was it a big project or not 🤔

the-dump 2019-02-14 23:33:22 I don't get it
the-dump 2019-02-15 02:54:28 
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:36:47 <@!295568493166985218> a little tip from one mod to another: don't get sucked into dumb arguments with people disobeying your orders. Ask the server owner to add a rule that makes a moderator's say the final say
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:37:35 Otherwise you end up losing dumb arguments like the one a few hours ago
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:49:37 A moderator from ROLve
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:49:45 Well, just U68 now
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:50:59 If people have a problem with authority they can leave at their own will, as long as they stay here though they should respect the staff
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:08:17 >Losing argument to random member of your discord
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:08:39 >Somebody feels bad for you so they give you ~~common sense~~ advice
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:09:03 >"Oh well I heard your mod team is shit anyways"
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:09:32 there's a reason why I left the rolve mod team and only do u68 now
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:02:00 smh jameson
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:02:05 idk how he's a mod
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:02:24 he seems like the runt of the pack
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:26 and rolve
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:35 mano was like 2017
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:02 
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:10 I am a moderator for U68
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:15 try me boy
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:44 Unit 1968
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:55 mhm
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:21:59 gone to shit I know
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:22:41 how so?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:24:00 oh I wasn't informed I had to reflect that here
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:24:39 I don't care if he believes me
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:26:25 I literally have devrolve in my friends list what else do you need
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:26:44 and adam, another common in the community
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:26:56 did you at least take my advice
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:27:59 last time he tried to confront somebody he got shut down because he couldn't defend himself
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:28:08 which is why I tried to give some advice
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:16 probably not ready yet
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:45 in-game moderation is a risky business and is inefficient
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:06 you heard james, I was in NH and mano
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:20 mano's in-game moderation was easily abused and sucked
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:31 moderating from discord is also faster
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:39 if you can get a report system connected
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:42 or use trello
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:32:14 rather than sending a mod into the game and finding the problem
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:32:21 they can do it all from a browser
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:32:59 turbo's got the problem
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:11 there needs to be more admins who can serve punishment
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:51 I said in-game moderation isn't the best method
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:34:40 you could have more than one person if you did it in trello or discord too
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:22 hire some trustworthy people as admins, give them access to a trello/discord panel to do conduct moderation without joining the game
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:57 in mano we had a trello board that could issue bans easily
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:05 just get their name and userID
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:40 I did, did you see where I said hire some trustworthy admins?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:51 yes, or at least you could
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:58 idk if it's still compatible
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:11 have you never used trello before?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:35 I'm not an expert on it but I guarantee you it worked
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:41 ofc the game owner has to set it up
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:54 I'm more talking to others here james
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:03 I agreed you need more admins to do game bans
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:13 I don't think I've ever seen trello go down
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:24 and in NH we did our moderation through discord
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:35 ik
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:48 it could, but it's been fine from what I've seen
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:18 anything can be posted here
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:29 and james pinged me here so
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:40:07 discord can't do full in-game moderation from what I know, unless it tied to trello
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:40:13 but webhooks certainly speed it up
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:40:57 if you know what you're doing it takes less than an hour
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:25 who said I knew
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:44 I had a discord for a branch of NH and a guy set up all the webhooks for me in like 5 mins
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:57 and he wasn't a dev from NH
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:42:09 not sure
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:42:20 if you don't wanna believe any of this that's fine
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:42:29 in the end I was trying to help
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:33 I knew we were talking about the same thing
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:37 yes you need more admins
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:47 and a third party system would help too
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:45:56 it does it faster
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:50 I'm saying what I know, just because my point's not the same as yours doesn't mean they can't coexist james
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:03 so we don't need in game moderation okay
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:26 that was just to make you type more
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:29 that was a joke
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:02 hey orange
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:12 maybe if you took my advice that I tried to give to james
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:17 you could cut this shit for us
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:39 make the rule first
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:22:44 may I just ask
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:22:53 how on earth is madattak related to this game anymore

the-dump 2019-05-25 07:17:30 I said 10 minutes
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:19:01 again, it's been 10 minutes
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:20:21 I can only tolerate so many 2009 impact font memes
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:21:21 thats almost as sad as actually liking them
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:21:55 I don't block people unless I need to
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:23:25 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399408989684891651/581245771173724186/image0.jpg here have a good one
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:23:41 this is a refined meme, aged 10 years
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:23:51 this is the epitome of comedy
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:24:43 those miata memes are only good if you find the people who laugh at them
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:24:49 they are the meme
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:26:21 hold on I got another one from the cellar
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:26:38 this one's a classic
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:26:40 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399408989684891651/580561423550382081/6039d3b.jpg
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:28:45 it looks like it's offended by the shit you're saying about how it looks
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:30:01 I've got more but too much at once desensitizes you
the-dump 2019-05-26 06:53:13 where are you getting this minecraft font
the-dump 2019-05-27 21:45:45 mcu = minecraft univeristy
the-dump 2019-05-29 19:05:20 Not if they don't get reposted
the-dump 2019-05-31 23:06:04 they're multiplying
the-dump 2019-06-02 04:25:45 what about the shelf
the-dump 2019-06-02 05:06:13 ikea
the-dump 2019-06-05 02:43:25 why does he sound like principal skinner having a nightmare
the-dump 2019-06-05 10:03:25 You could build one out of cheap wood for 20 bucks
the-dump 2019-06-05 10:58:19 So I was dicking around on omegle last night and somebody immediately starts asking about my interests after politely saying hi
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:00:11 "Do you like MLP?" "Never watched it no" "Any cartoons?" "Nope" "What about furries?" "No, nor do I watch anime or anything else you're gonna ask" "wow you're lame bye"
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:00:29 Tfw a weeb furry brony calls you lame
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:01:16 I wanted to ask but they DCed
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:01:46 I've seen a lot of weird shit on omegle and that's one of the weirdest
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:02:24 Just figured out this discord has blacklisted words
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:04:10 *blacklisting simplified term for adult content*
the-dump 2019-06-05 11:04:20 We did it boys, NSFW is no more

the-dump 2019-06-27 21:14:41 I remember that movie
the-dump 2019-07-03 02:02:14 you don't say
the-dump 2019-07-03 03:20:31 that title has bipolar disorder
the-dump 2019-07-05 00:24:31 I've lost more today than you can possibly imagine
the-dump 2019-07-05 00:28:32 I used the diglett to destroy the diglett
the-dump 2019-07-18 16:15:26 lol fonkl fell for it
the-dump 2019-07-20 19:11:58 I don't know why they'd announce the day they're gonna do it
the-dump 2019-07-20 19:12:21 Like unless they hijack the entire site and its entire user database and their info there's no danger
the-dump 2019-07-22 13:39:34 
the-dump 2019-07-22 13:57:24 
the-dump 2019-07-23 21:24:36 the front of that box is actually just seethrough plastic
the-dump 2019-07-23 21:29:51 bitch my joke
the-dump 2019-07-23 21:29:57 u stepped on it
the-dump 2019-07-23 21:30:47 I know nobody stepped on my life
the-dump 2019-07-23 21:31:11 thats why unlike yours it isn't 2 dimensional
the-dump 2019-07-24 13:57:40 rip blood and iron
the-dump 2019-07-24 13:57:50 fun while it lasted
the-dump 2019-07-26 18:34:45 Nice onion post
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:15:04 this channel needs a no earrape rule
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:15:49 its true
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:16:13 or better yet
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:16:20 settle on an earrape warning
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:23:01 so put a warning before your mp4
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:31:53 overly complicated front with massive holes that probably do nothing
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:36:03 eh
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:36:17 wheels look more stylish than functional
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:36:21 in fact the whole car does
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:36:37 looks like like it'd cost 120k+ and do 60s in 4+s
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:36:50 but it's BMW so worth
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:37:19 interior would fall apart after 3 years
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:37:53 should've put the engine in instead
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:38:03 then it'd be quality
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:38:28 I know
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:51:48 thats extremely overpriced
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:52:22 everything but the stuff under the hood is literally from the junk yard
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:52:59 that suspension and axle setup looks like its from an old truck
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:53:16 why tf does an offroader have nitrous btw
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:54:07 nitrous sounds useless on an offroader
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:55:07 unless it's some kind of desert racer
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:55:49 without that nitrous you could still get more than enough power for thousands of dollars less
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:56:46 it can cost as much as you make it cost
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:56:55 the more you use it the more you buy more
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:57:16 why would you drag with wheels like those
the-dump 2019-07-27 23:59:44 well now it's all making sense
the-dump 2019-07-28 00:00:12 if you said that at the start it would've made more sense
the-dump 2019-07-28 00:00:24 but I still don't think it's worth more than 30k
the-dump 2019-07-28 00:00:52 ...I thought you said 100k
the-dump 2019-07-28 00:01:13 yeah thats what confused me most
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:07:13 what is this supposed to be
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:07:26 somebody breathing dramatically
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:07:57 this is a known fact
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:09:11 ?
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:09:16 I'm not a weeb
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:10:23 I don't think you know how judging something works
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:10:39 first you have to experience it before you can give an opinion
the-dump 2019-07-29 20:11:54 can you confirm this character is disabled

the-dump 2019-08-08 21:40:38 it's the same as the chemical in a fire extinguisher, it just smothers and prevents access to air
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:41:30 I'd hit them
