plane-crazy 2022-12-16 17:55:54 can someone help me on my artillery truck
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 17:56:21 the suspension ive built works really well but when the truck is moving or standing still the front end is tilting downward and not horizontal
general 2022-12-16 17:58:37 can someone help me on my artillery truck in dms
general 2022-12-16 17:58:43 its finished but has a minor issue i wanna fix

general 2022-12-16 18:07:39 can someone help me out on a build im working on
general 2022-12-16 18:07:45 something is wrong with the suspension
general 2022-12-16 18:29:12 can someone help me on my build something is wrong on the suspension
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 05:34:09 Can anyone help me out
i got this big artillery/missile truck and i wanna rework the doors
dm me cuz i aint got image perms
general 2022-12-17 05:55:48 is anyone down to help me on my artillery truck
im not a big fan of the doors ive made and i wanna get some help to remake em
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 06:56:20 Any ideas for new doors for my artillery truck? It currently uses Servo motor 2's to flip the doors up 90* and there are block 1x0.9 on the sides of the driver cockpit so the doors can flip up and down easier. I feel like the doors I have now are too big, bulky and make the cockpit look bad. Any ideas?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:02:44 prob a visual bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:02:47 reset or reload ur plane?

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:19:06 So something like this basically?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:19:22 alright
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:19:29 should i go bigger with the wheels or nah
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:19:35 im using cylinder 2 2x2
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:19:44 hm
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:25:05 its coming together pretty well rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:25:20 im gonna be sacrificing alot of off-road ability though
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:25:38 ik i just dont know how
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:25:44 i dont wanna make the whole build like
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:25:46 overly tall
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:26:38 where do i put it
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:27:21 ok this is what im at rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:27:30 im experimenting with my test build
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:27:37 where would i put spring
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:28:30 i rarely ever dabble in motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:28:36 hell, i try to avoid it in my builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:28:59 oh yeah right ik i can do that
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:29:00 but
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:29:08 where the hell do i PUT the suspension
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:29:18 
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:29:29 OHH
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:29:30 WAIT

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:31:10 ohh
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:31:14 ok i guess
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:33:05 ok im monke at motorlocking this shit is like witchcraft to me
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:47:41 i changed my mind, imma just do something like this then motorlock it to the hull
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:49:11 idk maybe
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 07:49:14 ill find a way around it

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 08:06:51 i got this now
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:27:43 Making a zeppelin/airship, and could use some assistance.
Im currently tinkering with the ammount of propellers I put inside, to help it stay afloat.
I currently have 3 small propellers on the right and left on each side of the airship.
After they are on full power for a few seconds, my airship does a barrel roll and flips over.
Too much helium? Or too many propellers?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:29:53 This is what both tubes of the airship are looking like. The white blocks are holding the pieces together
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:12 The controls on the propellers are reverse thrust and E increase and Q decrease
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:19 Apply at center is off btw
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:30:36 Lining the sides with helium?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:00 Right now the issue with my airship is staying floating, without like doing barrel rolls and allat.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:20 Right now when I power my propellers to full throttle my airship does barrel rolls and shit.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:36 So I should line the sides with helium?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:31:47 I have a total of 4 tiny propellers.. Look at the screenshots.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:04 How's that?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:33:30 Im gonna probably add more propellers and helium later on, after I add like the deck below the airship.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:35:00 4 propellers total was too little.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:35:06 Gonna make it 8 and see how that goes.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:36:59 Yeah I definetly had wayyy to much helium.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:37:08 8 propellers isn't even lifting me off the ground.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:39:16 Increasing to 10 propellers.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:40:21 Almost there.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:40:24 Going to 12,
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:04 What the fuck
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:09 12 is doing this shit again
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:13 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:13 Im doing barrel rolls
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:20 im gonna stay at 10 propellers but add more helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:42:26 see how that does
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:43:53 Yes.
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:00 bro what the actual fuck
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:05 i added 8 more helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:11 now i float the moment i spawn in
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:44:20 fuck it maybe ballast blocks will fix this <@456511186955927562> ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:45:13 well im slowly but surely finding the root problem
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:45:26 im either adding too many propellers or too much helium
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:46:38 imma just start playing with ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:46:42 see what thatll do
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:21 ok i did 8 ballast beams
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:24 density 10
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:28 imma lower the density to 1
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:47:36 8 ballast beams with max density made me fall instantly
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:00 oh wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:05 they were ballast beams
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:08 they were at 40 density
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:10 i made it 40 now
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:37 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:48:39 imma try tanks
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:03 wait so how do i use ballast tnaks
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:06 these controls kinda confusing
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:31 oh wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:50:33 these are used in subs
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:51:45 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:51:46 well
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:51:51 fuck it imma just add the decks and shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:51:57 after that ill work on making this thing flyable
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:52:10 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 01:32:05 yooo ur making the laat??
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 01:32:19 nice
