general 2020-06-03 19:55:44 wtf is this
general 2020-06-03 19:56:04 1. do you have enough lift
general 2020-06-03 19:56:08 2. do you have enough engine power
general 2020-06-03 19:56:26 3. do you have enough (or too much) control panels
general 2020-06-03 19:56:32 jet
general 2020-06-03 19:56:32 send picture of het
general 2020-06-03 19:56:49 uhh
general 2020-06-03 19:56:54 the body
general 2020-06-03 19:57:03 you need two wings in the back
general 2020-06-03 19:57:08 tail wings i believe they are called
general 2020-06-03 19:57:18 and the wings look like they need to be larger
general 2020-06-03 19:57:28 and jet engines
general 2020-06-03 19:57:34 need to have some sort of movement to actually work
general 2020-06-03 19:57:49 jet engines won't work if they aren't moving upon start
general 2020-06-03 19:57:58 you can have them fully turned on
general 2020-06-03 19:58:10 wait till your engines to start up and press g
general 2020-06-03 19:58:14 the plane should accelerate
general 2020-06-03 19:58:41 for any jet engine <@!332615504315416586>
general 2020-06-03 19:58:46 well
general 2020-06-03 19:58:48 at least in my experience
general 2020-06-03 19:58:58 they won't budge unless you introduce any sort of movement
general 2020-06-03 19:59:20 mmm
general 2020-06-03 19:59:25 🤷
general 2020-06-03 19:59:51 for me, jet engines never work unless the vehicle is already moving
general 2020-06-03 20:00:17 shape of wings is basically irrelevant on that level
general 2020-06-03 20:03:50 uhhh
general 2020-06-03 20:03:55 i think you need larger wings
general 2020-06-03 20:03:57 for that size body
general 2020-06-03 20:04:01 and stronger engines, maybe
general 2020-06-03 20:04:22 im not the best plane builder, sorry

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:36:18 Do shredders need time duration to be able to destroy blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:36:23 Or is it based on contact
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:36:36 So I can have a machine that flings shredders and absolutely destroys everything

Talking shungite. Anyways, its a 2 billion year old like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. So thats my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa. Little pyramids. Stuff like that.
