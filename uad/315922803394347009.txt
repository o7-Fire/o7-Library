creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:02:30 no?... im just stating the fact nobody reads tos lol. i literally don't know a single person who actually reads tos.
creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:04:54 yeah no shit, literally everyone knows it's 13 and over. i'm not disputing that fact, i'm just saying that nobody reads the tos lmao, which means there isn't really a point to tell someone to read the tos because who tf actually reads tos??? it's not a difficult concept to grasp.
creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:07:24 i never knew 12 year olds were this dumb lmao, i thought they could at least form a sentence. shit's wild af.
