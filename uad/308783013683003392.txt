The Tale of hako4570 (308783013683003392)
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:48:01 due to the sheer weight of the 4th part, it has trouble being lifted by motors. Should I try to lessen weight by using helium blocks as a replacement or something like wings or something instead.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:52:34 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:52:47 ends up still falling lmao
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:53:17 thinking of replacing blocks with helium blocks to try and lessen weight and using slabs (they reduce weight right)
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:53:53 like I'd try to bend it one way, but it'd go the other way instead
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:54:18 so like if to connect the piece was f, and I pressed f, it'd go backward away from the piece
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:54:27 pressed it both ways. f and r
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:54:48 I did try most solutions, I'll still give it a go, thank you.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:56:19 there are guides online
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:56:44 either wrong button or the weight is too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 23:56:52 or motors were messed up
