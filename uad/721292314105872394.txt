general 2022-10-02 13:29:30 in trench warfare, trying to get past the barriers is a death sentence.. since the opposing side could fill you with 1000 rounds of ammo

general 2022-10-02 13:38:50 nah man... the most satisfying thing in plane crazy.. is seeing the purge of shredder bugs... watch them melt into nothing but ash... watching their power fade and screech in a pit of pain and suffering... WATCH AS THEIR SOULS ARE PURGED BY THE 9TH LAYER OF HELL... WATCH THE HELL FIRE PURGE THE SHREDDERS AND MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THEM SURVIVE... or idk something like that. :P

general 2022-10-03 02:19:25 Lol fr?
general 2022-10-03 02:20:29 If the SU-57 has screws in it then.. maybe it was a mistake to have it in Top gun maverick üíÄ <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-10-03 02:20:53 fr
general 2022-10-03 02:22:01 1. its tom cruise, 2. its 4.5 gen fighter, 3. plot armour, 4. f-14 tomcat, 5. russia's budget has gone kaputt.
general 2022-10-03 02:23:05 because top gun
general 2022-10-03 02:24:17 birb with yellow circle is the symbol of enemy nation in maverick
general 2022-10-03 02:27:45 btw the only reason goose died the way he did in top gun, is because a stunt pilot died from a flatspin in the filming of top gun, so they had goose died in a flatspin to show honour to the stunt pilot, (even though that it was definitely possible for Maverick to recover from that kind of flat-spin), so the theory was he hadn't had flatspin recovery training.
general 2022-10-03 02:28:39 they added iceman in that part of the script just to kill goose üíÄ
general 2022-10-03 02:29:29 I love that vid.
general 2022-10-03 02:33:04 That scene with "the terrain will confuse his targeting system" is so stupid.. because legit in the next scene, MAVERICK CAN FUCKING USE MISSILE LOCK AGAINST THE SU-57... BUT APPARENTLY THE SU-57 CAN'T...? RUSSIA YOUR BUDGET IS EITHER BROKE OR YOUR TECHNOLOGY IS -10
general 2022-10-03 02:33:33 That scene with "the terrain will confuse his targeting system" is so stupid.. because legit in the next scene, MAVERICK CAN FUCKING USE MISSILE LOCK AGAINST THE SU-57... BUT APPARENTLY THE SU-57 CAN'T...? RUSSIA YOUR BUDGET IS EITHER BROKE OR YOUR TECHNOLOGY IS -10
general 2022-10-03 02:34:37 well i mean, they were only on patrol at the time.
general 2022-10-03 02:34:55 fr
general 2022-10-03 02:35:13 yeah darkstar was cool
general 2022-10-03 02:35:35 ik fr
general 2022-10-03 02:37:44 I don't know how you wouldn't fucking explode when ejecting at mach 10, considering that in the 1970's a guy in his f-15 ejected at mach 1.5 and had both of his legs broken, and one of their arms broken. thank god they survived.
general 2022-10-03 02:38:23 yeah true
general 2022-10-03 02:39:10 ikr
general 2022-10-03 02:39:54 unless darkstar has somekind of magical airbrake that slows him down from mach 10 to 0 in 2 seconds
general 2022-10-03 02:40:42 tom cruise should of become paste in the dark star's burning cockpit..
general 2022-10-03 02:41:24 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-10-03 02:42:01 also how df does darkstar's explosion go blue?
general 2022-10-03 02:42:30 darkstar must've gone fucking supernova üíÄ
general 2022-10-03 02:45:53 well if elon musk can design a theoretically possible light speed engine... anything is apparently possible now... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:21:50 So far, this looks great!
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:22:16 NICE
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:23:42 Ok, if you were tasked with choosing the next block/mechanic/item idea for plane crazy 1/2 ... what would it be...?
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:24:08 for me, it would be Timed Disconnectors.
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:25:57 essentially they work like normal disconnectors, but when the key is pressed, it doesn't disconnect it automatically, instead... it waits for a timer set by the builder (0.05 to 3 seconds) to finish, then it will disconnect.
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:26:46 well they are adding a scale tool to the game, so maybe... ü§û
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:29:45 Nah i already knew it was an F-105
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:31:45

plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:33:35 
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:33:57 Don't know how this looks like an F-105 but whatever i guess...
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:34:29 yep pretty accurate
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:35:49 bro this is australian camo... how does it fucking look like vietnam camo....?????

creations-chat 2022-10-25 06:38:33 As I said in <#384025409945337856> This could get a redesign, so feel free to comment feedback to help fix the design, and for more info: It's a Torpedo Ram Class Iron Clad Battleship in 1890's England, and it was utilized to defend smaller steamships to escape England from Alien Fighting Machines.
creations-chat 2022-10-26 09:12:13 So... HMS Thunderchild... I might redesign mine lol... can someone tell me how to improve the design to make it more realistic/cool looking lol, (even though it's a fictional torpedo ram from an alien invasion novel, lol) Feedback would be great! and uhh... yeah...
creations-chat 2022-10-26 09:14:17 More photos of it are in <#384025409945337856> but you need to scroll up a fair bit.
bug-reports 2022-11-09 11:38:30 maybe roblox updated some of the websites code, which is causing the update loop maybe...?
