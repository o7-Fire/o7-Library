plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:12:21 its only 1 tank i can recall has this layhout
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:12:27 the t72
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:12:36 t64 and t80 have lots of small wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:12:45 t34 is not post war (technically)
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:13:19 t55 has 5 big wheels with a big space between the first and 2nd wheel
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 18:13:40 haha wrong t34

creations-chat 2020-09-10 18:14:59 its technically not a post war tank

creations-chat 2020-09-10 18:16:19 both the abrams and leopard (2 most popular NATO tanks i guess) have load of smaller wheels like the t64/80
creations-chat 2020-09-10 18:16:37 but only the t72 has 6 evenly spaced big wheels
creations-chat 2020-09-10 18:18:24 its the "down there devastator"

creations-chat 2020-09-11 17:07:45 both skirts done now
creations-chat 2020-09-11 17:07:57 
help 2020-09-11 17:10:46 how do i 
1. make it faster without rebuilding half of it
2. stop it from throwing tracks all the time whilst still looking good?
help 2020-09-11 17:13:03 i dont know you so i dont know why youre pissed
help 2020-09-11 17:14:45 oof
help 2020-09-11 17:14:49 well im sorry for your loss
help 2020-09-11 17:14:53 but...
help 2020-09-11 17:15:01 what does it have to do with a hood?
help 2020-09-11 17:15:08 they are already at max
help 2020-09-11 17:15:19 OH
help 2020-09-11 17:15:25 makes sense now
help 2020-09-11 17:15:41 i know
help 2020-09-11 17:15:52 but how to hold them on whilst still looking good?
help 2020-09-11 17:16:03 i cant
help 2020-09-11 17:16:56 using 1x0.9 blocks right here, if i used friction blocks it would just connect to them
help 2020-09-11 17:17:33 and there would be too much slackif i extended the track by 1 link on each side
help 2020-09-11 17:17:53 when you say fabric
help 2020-09-11 17:17:59 you mean friction blocks right?
help 2020-09-11 17:18:04 it has suspension
help 2020-09-11 17:18:21 both in tension and actual suspension
help 2020-09-11 17:18:36 
help 2020-09-11 17:19:15 like "fabric" material?
help 2020-09-11 17:19:24 oh
help 2020-09-11 17:19:32 i thought you meant "use the friction blocks"
help 2020-09-11 17:19:41 this solves a lot of issues
help 2020-09-11 17:19:48 thanks
help 2020-09-11 17:21:44 what about the tracks falling off?
help 2020-09-11 17:21:56 how do i make something on the bottom to hold them?
help 2020-09-11 17:22:05 the sideskirts on the top hold it on the top
help 2020-09-11 17:22:10 but what about the bottom?
help 2020-09-11 17:26:36 the tracks pop off on the bottom
help 2020-09-11 17:26:41 where they touch the ground
help 2020-09-11 17:26:47 not where they get powered
help 2020-09-11 17:27:19 the tracks?
help 2020-09-11 17:27:28 they stay a loop
help 2020-09-11 17:27:36 but slide off of the wheels
help 2020-09-11 17:27:39 let me demonstrate
help 2020-09-11 17:28:35 of course now they dont want to pop off
help 2020-09-11 17:29:05 just  copied something off of the internet
help 2020-09-11 17:29:08 works fine as a track
help 2020-09-11 17:29:29 can make it tighter im afraid
help 2020-09-11 17:30:00 i could cut down on this but i dont know how to do it without destroying the pattern
help 2020-09-11 17:30:08 they look loose because im in build mode
help 2020-09-11 17:30:29 this is what it actually looks like when driving
help 2020-09-11 17:30:53 yup on both sides
help 2020-09-11 17:31:05 only problem i have is they compress when i accelerate
help 2020-09-11 17:31:12 they compress a little
help 2020-09-11 17:31:14 but still
help 2020-09-11 17:31:26 the free length and strength are at max
help 2020-09-11 17:31:47 finally got it to almost pop off
help 2020-09-11 17:32:37 dunno if i have enough space tbh
help 2020-09-11 17:32:41 ill try
help 2020-09-11 17:36:03 hmm
help 2020-09-11 17:36:07 how did i not see this
help 2020-09-11 17:36:49 well it fixes the irregular power delivery
help 2020-09-11 17:36:58 but i think theyll still pop off
help 2020-09-11 17:38:34 this tank was primarily made to look good
help 2020-09-11 17:38:51 movement was at a lower priority
help 2020-09-11 17:45:40 i went with this sacrifice
help 2020-09-11 17:45:43 works well
help 2020-09-11 17:45:45 
help 2020-09-11 17:45:49 doesnt hurt the looks
help 2020-09-11 17:45:56 especially after i paint it
help 2020-09-11 17:46:46 now it doesn't
help 2020-09-11 17:48:01 too bad its not your tank :)

on another note WHY THE SLOWMODE
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:32:47 your golf has a nice style to it. its small, but the important features are bigger
bot-central 2020-09-27 01:34:50 -mapsuggest make the map bigger, in every aspect, right now, most realistic planes dwarf the airport
bot-central 2020-09-27 01:35:16 !help
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:37:38 my t72 tracks look like this, they work fine, sometimes glitch through the tension idler, but thats pretty rare
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:38:59 what do people think of the whole thing?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:39:26 smoke pipes are borked and spew too much now
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:41:47 <@!720751430595772418> if you mean those boxes on the sides of the turret then no, those are smoke launchers, if you mean a part, then no i dont have it. those ladders are standard on the PT-91M2 model, which i tried to recreate. they detonate RPG's and other HEAT ammunition early, to hopefully save the crew

<@456226577798135808> turret is to scale actually, russians never thought of comfort
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:42:22 citroen 2cv
creations-chat 2020-09-27 01:43:25 yeah those ladders are there on the real thing

what i meant was this:
> pretty good, do you have firework launchers?
<@!720751430595772418>

creations-chat 2020-09-30 17:41:59 do that, then you can maybe consider it realistic

<@456226577798135808> or maybe 5
creations-chat 2020-09-30 17:42:34 but will everything break if it disconnects

creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:52:09 are you from eastern europe?

creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:53:59 <@!498594192709386251> are you from eastern europe?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:54:17 everything east of germany
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:54:43 ah, so youre just interested in soviet trucks?

creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:55:29 <@!720751430595772418> i got a new rank lol
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:58:18 im thinking i want to make a star 266
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:58:41 or as i said a kraz 255
creations-chat 2020-10-01 14:59:24 i do care, hooli, tonk  and now trucke
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:13:00 now guys, is making live axle suspension worth it?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:15:10 björn did
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:15:25 hello g05
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:17:07 so, ill just ask again because people like to ignore me <:Sadge:737464365338329178> 

is "developing" live axle suspension worth it?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:20:21 add live axle suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:20:42 you cant not make it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:21:31 add more shocks, for most of my builds, i have 3 shocks right next to each other, it can carry ~10 ballast beams at full weight
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:21:48 so, add 6 next to eachother
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:22:54 add live axle suspension, its nice to look at
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:23:10 ill give you an example soon™️
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:24:19 its nice to look at
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:38:09 hey look its live axle suspension
i forgot the pic
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:38:29 
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:43:46 hey look its live axle suspension in action! (excuse the bottoming out, bounciness etc. the suspension is not tuned properly)
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:44:57 i just said it looked nice
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:45:13 not that it works
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:45:37 its not connected at the center point, but it rotates around it <@!484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:46:01 and goes up and down, but i cant fix that
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:52:26 <@!484529511468236802> it almost rotates around the center point, i also goes up and down a fair bit, but i cant figure out how to stop that
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:53:19 ^thats what it does
it does go up and down, but not side to side
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:55:41 you cant have an axle that rotates around a center point, and only make it move up and down, the wheels have to go up and down in this manner, kinda banana shaped
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:58:43 this is the best i can do i think, if you want to see something specifically, just let me know <@!484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:02:57 how do i connect it to an axle and still make it work? i tried this, but that stopped it from rotating at all
creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:11:29 add pastel blue and pink accents
creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:13:38 ***wedges***
creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:18:09 i have improved my design
creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:19:19 still not true live axle but oh well
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:05:38 theres some guy in a pink car harrassing me
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:06:00 <:haha:452926659654451230>
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:06:46 it was a joke, anyways, here is his car
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:08:33 dang if thats real, then its unreal (<:haha:452926659654451230>)
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:08:59 holy motorlock
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:10:24 whadd'er'ya makin' pardner?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:10:40 ah i remember
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:11:30 you know when you like the mzkt 7429, but you dont like the bumper so you make it smaller, but then youre mad because then it doesnt match the one in real life?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:10:44 what do people think of my MZKT-7429 right now?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:11:15 its technically sloped at the front
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:11:33 welcome to soviet design i guess
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:11:49 thanks for reminding me
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:13:12 i could do something like this but i dunno how this looks
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:13:34 it looks like this irl
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:14:39 spintires is the best i can give ya
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:15:09 
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:16:41 there we go
much better
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:17:09 better picture
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:18:36 i cant wait to make the interior
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:18:58 its my favorite thing to do in this game, i had a lot of fun with my e30
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:19:34 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-13 22:20:53 even tho  no one will see the interior (other than the pictures) i still make it because i like it lol
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:45:09 not done yet, but how is it looking?

it came out a little short though, but it doesnt matter
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:45:35 theres windows on the side, but you can see them all that well because the interior is not done yet
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:46:04 the bumper sure is thicc, but thats how it is in real life
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:49:18 i think the grill is looking 100x better now
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:52:19 <@!387195148741771275> only other thing i can do i think is this. which looks bad
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:52:51 nope, for some reason, i dont do motorlock on anything
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:54:00 i thought it was a square until i clicked on it
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:55:16 i cant find the light blocks
help
creations-chat 2020-10-14 11:55:46 ah thats why
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:41:13 hey look its the MZKT-7429 again

i think its finished, but maybe you have some ideas as to what else i should add?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:45:34 ok i cant send another message in 1 and a half minute (what), so with or without "*rims*"

creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:50:03 <@!674434894616854548> whoever thought 2 mins of slowmode is "funny" or "helpful" shouldnt run a discord server
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:53:57 whenever i suggest turning it off and giving warnings instead im hit with things like "StOp ArGuInG iN <#504436696021204992> aND wE'LL TuRn It OfF" which is a bad reason

why punish everyone, if its easy and simple to punish the people who do the bad things

"oh we wont be able to keep tabs on everything" add more mods lol
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:56:03 every time i come back to this channel the slowmode seems to double, isnt this a clear sign that its not working?

you can just do this

and this

or this

to circumvent the slowmode lol

press "up arrow" then hold shift and press enter, youll start making a new line

after that just type away and argue
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:58:31 lol

anyways, should i add anything to my MZKT
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:07:07 thoughts?

it got a little squished in the design phase but fuck it
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:26:55 **c h i e f t a i n**

cool, but does it have something resembling live axle suspension?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:32:06 > why does that camouflage exist
> in what environment would it actually work
<@!551806781609869313>

creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:38:53 ive built a tank before, a very big one at that, but the whole track shenanigans are very time consuming

you can come see it if you want 


nvm you left
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:44:00 yeah i think
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:48:07 yeah but then its not realistic enough
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:50:59 wmv <:haha:452926659654451230>
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:53:41 or use xbox game bar like me/nvidia experience/amd software
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:54:57 or if you have snip&sketch just press print screen

snip&sketch is super useful
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:58:04 ok fuck it ill make a wyvern
creations-chat 2020-10-18 15:18:44 <@!720548378907377664> according to the mods, slowmode stops the toxic convos in this channel

but you can just edit your message like this

and this
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:01:26 what build
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:03:10 just use springs and drive around a little bit, youre bound to explode and go 100k speed or more
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:04:56 anyways, what build i should?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:06:38 are you talking about <@456226577798135808>?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:08:15 wow, you guys really hate <@456226577798135808>, huh?

anyways, since no one answered me, what should i build?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:09:58 Buildings are not my thing

i build cars/trucks/anything with wheels, heli's and tanks
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:13:01 i mean, technically im making an uaz-469, but im not really feeling it

which servers are people in rn?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:15:27 imagine putting effort into your creations, i just put a shitload of spotify and chips into my creations, and they come out looking good
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:17:52 <a:lmao:632321248109527040>

creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:21:04 imagine using stock discord emojis
<:pogey:651848693842182144>
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:22:36 slowmode is still a joke imo, mods should do mod stuff instead of fucking everyone over by using slowmode

if you ask me theres no good reason to use slowmode
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:29:09 ok fuck it im making my own car (as in my daily driver)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:31:23 any ideas as to how to make this? 3x1 wedge + 4x1 wedge?

<@!655236433501618180> yeah, real life wheel is a 5x5 cylinder, everything else is based off of that
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:34:03 <@!414359638302130176> its going to be 1:1 as far as it can

real life wheel is a 5x5 in the game, and everything else is based off of that

man if only i had bigger cylinders
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:35:39 just go to a vip server (this discord has 4 free ones)

use the servers command in <#384027830192832513>
bot-central 2020-11-03 21:52:00 !servers
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:59:58 motor lock got borked
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:02:30 how accurate is it? (reference coming in 1 and a half minute)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:06:01 lights are pretty ugly, but no other solution i think
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:09:02 proportions would be off above the wheelwell, its already 1 block too high
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:17:08 also with 2 block high lights + grill i cant make the angel eyes the e39 has... (looks better in dark grey)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:21:27 wheel thing or no wheel thing? ^
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:33:22 problem...

windshield can either be made out of 1x1 wedges (which looks too boxy imo) or 1x2 wedges (that makes it looks like a sports car, and thats not right)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:34:58 what does a brother like me do?

with the 1x2's the windshield ends where the seconds pair of doors begin lol
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:38:11 its not apparently, but we use it as if it was anyways
creations-chat 2020-11-04 01:29:50 <:DougOof:555377542635323392>
creations-chat 2020-11-04 01:32:35 cant see how that wouldnt drain him of all life energy
creations-chat 2020-11-04 17:35:03 ok so lets say i want to make an f-104, but the wings are tiny and this game needs huge wings to make stuff fly

how do i make smaller wings that make big amounts of lift?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 17:44:56 <@!720751430595772418> how do i into motorlock
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:54:55 does this resemble anything to you guys? correct answer will win a bag of nothing

its a plane, and im talking about specific model (camo is country specific too)

i can give a hint if you want
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:56:44 its relatively thin

<@!519320539538522116> congrats heres your bag of nothing
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:58:18 > this isnt a flying tank
well its the russian version of that

the a10 would be the american version
creations-chat 2020-11-04 20:26:41 baboom, needs a tail, some ordnance and a paintjob 

looks good imo
creations-chat 2020-11-04 20:28:33 i know im saying this a lot, but slowmode is not the way to go, moderating chats is the correct way

slowmode affects everyone instead of the people doing the wrong things

therefore making giving feedback hard

i mean, not many people seem to be using this obvious loophole that im using right now but oh well
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:11:47 tail is done, only need some boom boom and some detail
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:13:58 i need to fit in all that detail somehow

<@!719168864705052802> i know but i have no idea how to make that without spending the next few hours fixing it
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:15:55 for some reason i have never used motor locking

none of my 6 or 7 designs have motorlock
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:52:54 frogfoot has camo now, i cant find it
fuck i forgot the picture, oh well its coming in 1 min

<@!309347794588794880> wow thats exactly what ive been saying the last 3 days also dobry wieczor
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:54:26 and here the picture
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:00:33 how the hell am i supposed to attach something to my wings?

i cant have a frogfoot without boom sticks and bombs

shh
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:03:13 vent wing intensifies
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:33:34 roblox fixed itself actually

but black magic sounds better
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:36:09 <@!515577365720596492> whats wrong with my frogfoot? (other than the stuff i mentioned?) i want muh feedback

<@!719168864705052802> that doesnt look good if youre talking about attaching stuff to wings (bulges out on the other side of the wing) and disconnecting gear doesnt make it *retract*
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:38:34 ok well harsnavary was right, and im just stupid, im off to make some ordnance

cant make it look good and be round :(
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:51:32 drop tank too chonky or not?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:55:01 nop
i maybe can make it drop
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:59:57 what is that second piston looking thing?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:07:41 big enough to where i can fit all the detail i want
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:12:11 48 blocks long <@!519320539538522116> (45 if you dont count the pitot tube)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:14:57 probably
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:16:34 <:wot:695654208837255219> bold assumption
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:20:10 sounds like something the russians would say
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:21:48 i guess thats a *bomber* but i think he is talking about bomber bombers

 <@!720751430595772418> it has one if you squint your eyes, most fighters have "mg"s so i just chose one that has something that is not a mg

<@!246412229400985602> its technically a "meduim bomber" for some reason
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:23:34 which server are you guys in?

creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:32:58 I mean, they are they same guys who think slowmode is the appropriate solution to the toxicity on this channel <:haha:452926659654451230>

Sure it "kinda helps" but it isn't the correct solution
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:35:07 Lmao just get a simple warn system with dyno or any of the 1000000 other bots , 3 warns and your out is a 100x better solution than slowmode

Sauce: have made and am running discord servers
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:36:53 I mean, right now the slowmode is causing an argument, so its making things worse <:haha:452926659654451230>
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:38:30 <:yahuh:644836792935251998>
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:40:41 > Literally pinged the mods a bunch of times about obvious creation stealing (dude later got banned for posting a screenshot of him using jjsploit) and all they did was increase the slowmode
> 
> It wasn't until 4 hours later when I pinged Mega bc I saw he was on that something was finally done

Solution: more mods

Actual solution: slowmode
creations-chat 2020-11-06 11:59:14 what i build??
creations-chat 2020-11-06 12:00:56 either

although a tank would need a new track system

creations-chat 2020-11-06 12:04:58 id like to make something that looks *good*
creations-chat 2020-11-06 12:06:47 it looks like something i would have drawn when i was 5 years old or something
creations-chat 2020-11-06 12:12:35 ok fuck it im gonna make the obligatory russian fighter

creations-chat 2020-11-06 12:45:14 how do i make a more gradual drop than 1x4 wedges?

<@!383528513778745344> they wont react until 5 hours later lol

creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:41:25 should the intakes be bigger?

<@!727028164223696966> ive remade it, ill send a pic soon, and i cant make it less dumb looking, because the biggest wedges we have are 1x4 (1xX wedges pls)
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:43:21 i can either make it look really dumb, or make it look bulky
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:48:27 should the wind  be more angled? im using 1x2 delta wings rn
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:50:11 i have a better comparison here
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:52:26 su35

<@!685909594932773033> thanks

problem with the right one is that my plot is not long big enough, so i think i need to go with the left one or make the wing shorter
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:54:18 i have it open on my 2nd screen (not a real blueprint but it is easy to look at)

<@!347918144062488586> theres no longer wedges, those are 1x4's
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:58:22 this is what the wing would need to look like to maybe fit the tail and engines :(
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:26:37 is this a fine wing?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:34:32 <@456226577798135808> like this?

creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:44:00 ~~do i have to make a hole for the motorlock on the other side? or can i cover it?~~ yes id do
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:45:33 looks wrong, why? i found out
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:47:19 tadaaah, i will remove the top layer, so i dont have any motorlocks popping out the top
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:48:50 ive removed the top layer, that was a mistake i think and i forgot the pic... fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:50:25 pic
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:44:33 ok so the wings are done, not sure what to think of them
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:38:30 how can i fix my nose? (making an su35 btw)

i can either make it look really stupid or make it looks chonky like it is now
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:43:31 the best i could do is this, i just flattened the nose

anyways, with or without rims?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 22:52:58 <@456226577798135808> they are very simple but they look good, in my experience, the more complicated you make it look the better lol

its hard to make a proper splinter in plane crazy but heres something that looks like a splinter
creations-chat 2020-11-06 23:21:44 i could also make this light blue camo that usually pops up when you search for su35

creations-chat 2020-11-07 00:09:12 well, since we dont have anything bigger than 1x4 wedges, i cant make that gradual slope on the bottom of the nose <@!629858706997248000>

too much work for such slight of a slope, but thanks for the feedback, i have no idea how to do that since its my first time with motorlock

general 2020-11-10 21:49:03 when psu's light on fire, its because the live mains causes the sparking, not the rails which the psu's literally *step down* to *safe levels* so you can use it *safely* in consumer electronics <@!195253906333368320>

creations-chat 2020-11-10 22:42:46 
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:17:47 use it more then
thats the solution

<@456226577798135808> yes it does, but its not a great way to prevent arguments
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:19:18 ^ that
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:20:51 try harder then, whatever youre trying doesnt seem to work, add more mods, tell mods to moderate this channel instead of leaving it as is because "well slowmode does it well enough"

<@!308156968550268928> he wrote "we are trying to moderate more"
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:22:35 if the mods are doing their job, why do we have slowmode then?

its sufficient in other server, what makes this server so special?

get more people in different timezones, or make people ping mods

lmao what do you mean <@!195253906333368320> its the only thing i can do, compare this server to other servers
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:24:28 ok let me say it like this

other server make it work, why cant this server then?

im trying but all youre doing is saying "lmao im losing braincells"
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:26:00 lets not pile garbage on this channel, lets take this somewhere else?
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:28:04 no it isnt?

you literally just have to press the up arrow to start editing

cant see how thats harder
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:29:53 then after 1:30 the cycle continues <@!308156968550268928>, edit after edit, 1:30 goes by, they send another message, editing continues

i mean, there was an argument today

we are arguing right now too
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:34:11 nice

gg then, lets leave this subject
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:37:12 although, if discord let you exclude people from slowmode without giving them manage messages or manage channel permissions, you could exclude everyone that has an expert rank or something
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:39:30 majority of feedback right now looks something like this

"lmao those wings look like shit

  use motorlock noob *edited*™️ "

"ah well i cant fix it

 i dont like it because... *edited* ™️ "

i mean it kinda is your problem isnt it? you have to make sure people dont behave badly

imo this isnt the nicest behavior
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:41:23 > You guys should add a role called [role_name] which can bypass slowmode or idk tbh thats a bad idea lol
<@456226577798135808> you have to have "manage messages" or "manage channel" to be able to do that, giving that to everyone is a bad idea btw

creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:14:22 how should i fix the canopy? and also that sounds way too complicated <:lul:649626556548775937>
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:15:57 the proportions are correct :) (well its as correct as i can get with plane crazy, without using crazy motorlock)

i had to make it a little wider to get the length correct
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:18:50 how can i fix the canopy? whats the process of making those thin lines?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:20:25 > requires building an enormous motor stack thats also toggleable

ah so i wont be able make it, lol, thanks for the feedback though

general 2020-11-11 16:11:23 now, is there some kind of actual warning system or do warnings just pile up?
general 2020-11-11 16:11:52 mutes should also be added
general 2020-11-11 16:14:32 wait a second
general 2020-11-11 16:15:28 why is "fuck", "shit" and the likes allowed when the acronym that i got a warn for is not allowed?
general 2020-11-11 16:15:44 dang kinkshaming

creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:12:59 hmmm, yeah i think so too, but then i cant make it be perfectly between the cylinders

i also fixed cylinder no. 2 bottom

ill see how the half wedge fits in there
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:15:20 how should it look? i cant see how a half wedge would be better
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:22:13 it is made out of half blocks btw

i need to start the other side <:Sadge:737464365338329178>
creations-chat 2020-11-11 19:04:00 should i add working pistons & a crankshaft to my engine?*

you wont really be able to see it

since i want to build the head + cover and oilpan also

creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:40:41 unsymmetrical exhaust manifolds have a very destinct sound, and if designed correctly, can have better airflow, bmw knows their stuff

these are pretty symmetrical compared to some other ones
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:47:37 the exhaust valve does not "suck" out the exhaust gasses, the piston goes up one more time to push it out, and on the way back, suck in air

that is at least what happens in a 4 stroke engine
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:49:18 "Suck, squeeze, bang, blow" <- easy way to remember the basics 4 stroke engines

do NOT warn me again for "sexual" language, that is a purely technical term

general 2020-12-23 19:17:57 do you have a mig now?
general 2020-12-23 19:18:16 mig21pfm is basically a better f-13
general 2020-12-23 19:18:30 so no point in having it if you have anything better than a f-13
general 2020-12-23 19:20:18 PFM basically stands for interceptor, forced, modernized
general 2020-12-23 19:20:24 so its a modernized f-13
general 2020-12-23 19:20:35 im not sure what forced means
general 2020-12-23 19:20:43 but thats what my russian skills make it to be
general 2020-12-23 19:25:05 as i said
general 2020-12-23 19:25:16 then keep it
general 2020-12-23 19:25:38 if you had something better than a f-13, then you should sell it
general 2020-12-23 19:25:50 since the pfm is an improved f-13
general 2020-12-23 19:26:06 guessing 10.0
general 2020-12-23 19:26:08 or 10.3
general 2020-12-23 19:26:17 yes
general 2020-12-23 19:26:28 same as the f-13
general 2020-12-23 19:26:30 i think
general 2020-12-23 19:26:51 so r-3s
general 2020-12-23 19:26:58 i dont think it will get r-60's
general 2020-12-23 19:27:19 guessing not
general 2020-12-23 19:27:30 but at least, the pfm should get AGM's

creations-chat 2021-01-22 13:46:00 lets hope that i can somehow make this into a bmp2
creations-chat 2021-01-22 13:48:11 i like the general look, but the gaps and holes are killer for me, i know it probably cant get fixed because its roblox
creations-chat 2021-01-22 14:04:08 new tracks perform well i think

creations-chat 2021-01-22 17:31:30 bmp2 turret is like an mbt turret, but for dwarves

in a place where 30mm cannons are as deadly as 125mm ones
creations-chat 2021-01-22 17:35:22 quick poll: should i make an interior?

i have quite a bit of space

V thanks for the feedback V
creations-chat 2021-01-22 18:03:26 turret ring poggers, yes it will rotate
creations-chat 2021-01-22 18:06:58 mfw my first post on this server was a wip
creations-chat 2021-01-22 18:47:21 troop compartment poggers <:pogey:651848693842182144>
creations-chat 2021-01-22 18:49:48 looking forwards

there are periscopes (triangle wedges), what i presume is NBC equipment (half wedges), seats and turret monster protector (hard to see but its in front of the basket)
creations-chat 2021-01-22 18:55:10 i couldnt help it, i added more meaningless detail
creations-chat 2021-01-22 19:05:13 wait a second, whats a friction block? does it have more friction than fabric? also, progress on the outside

general 2021-01-22 19:48:17 thts the point of the game lmao
general 2021-01-22 19:48:25 trying to get my turret working
general 2021-01-22 19:48:51 ive got pretty big tracks and 2.9k blocks in the hull
general 2021-01-22 19:48:59 git gud i guess
creations-chat 2021-01-22 19:50:15 got the turret ring + basket spinning, it doesnt spin well, but its better than nothing
creations-chat 2021-01-22 19:52:21 BMP-2, its really wide i know, but thats because i was experimenting with tracks and found one that i liked and started to build off of the "prototype" lmao

it has a full interior by the way

im finishing the commander and driver seats

creations-chat 2021-01-23 00:27:30 i just like describing what i have made, along with features

sorry
creations-chat 2021-01-24 20:51:08 what should i make
thats is a tracked ground vehicle
creations-chat 2021-01-24 20:54:00 no
creations-chat 2021-01-24 21:01:40 no
creations-chat 2021-01-24 21:03:59 eh ill make something custom
creations-chat 2021-01-24 21:23:14 im kinda feeling a NATO-ified t-80

what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:15:24 how do you make a fume extractor on a 1x1 cylinder? cant make one that looks good
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:17:48 no reference, making a custom mbt, but ive made something that looks ok-ish
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:19:52 too fat, i dont like it <:peepoSad:623161775852093500>
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:23:58 how does this look? 
im trying to mix a soviet design (probably a t-80, as its my favorite) with some nato features (more sloped armor, that spaced turret armor from the leo 2a5, type 90 autoloader etc.)
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:27:57 i also intend on giving it an interior, albeit a more simple one than that of my bmp 2, that was hell
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:30:11 one challange i will face is adapting my tracks to the tank rather than the tank to the tracks as i usually do
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:31:41 damn it, the thing turned out a little longue

creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:04:06 what kind of details do you think i can add?

also, why do you think it looks funny? (the big bustle is because of the autoloader), the CITV and commanders cupola (the one with the mg) is rotatable!
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:06:39 oh yes, 2 antennas one each corner of the bustle i think would look cool, i might try the rails, but i wont dive into motorlock
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:15:07 did i overdo it on the rails?

thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 19:49:03 its not finished (obviously)
creations-chat 2021-02-05 19:53:38 this is tricky, i feel like the 3x3 cylinder is too small, but the 5x5 is too big (the bustle is supposed to be inaccessible due to the leclerc-style autoloader)
creations-chat 2021-02-05 19:56:17 i guess, should i move the hatch closest to the camera 1 block back?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 20:02:25 i moved the closest one 1 block back and the furthest one 1 block to the front (CITV too)

creations-chat 2021-02-05 22:07:04 thanks, i need some detail on the upper glacis, some skirts and a raised rear deck

bad thing is i havent even started on the interior yet

then i think its done actually
creations-chat 2021-02-05 22:15:20 its too late for the tracks (i would need to remake the whole tank), and the turret is gigantic, almost as wide and long as the tank

creations-chat 2021-02-07 00:15:03 im shite at camo, but i might try at the end, i meant more like physical things (vents, equipment or whatever)
creations-chat 2021-02-07 00:18:42 do you have any *real* suggestions
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:52:10 im sorry for the hilariously bad footage,

but  i made the turret spin and made an interior (i havent even really started making it) a breech, a moving breech block and an autoloader door

i need to sleep on the whole autoloader arm idea (https://youtu.be/n6nlvii-bP0?t=3)

what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:56:47 thanks :)

its a plane crazy thing <@!773699011059908640> thats just how things work here, but i dont use motorlock and get good amounts of upvotes (60-100+)
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:00:25 exposed motorlock is pretty ew (but i get it, thats why i dont do motorlock) and the rocket engine in the back looks meh

overall great build!!!

autoloader arm
drivers position
front hull ammo rack
add details to the front

creations-chat 2021-02-07 11:56:34 I made the commanders independent periscope (no better name i guess) a lot less fugly and changed the turret a little

anything else i should add before i dive into the interior?
i sill need more detail on the front, but i have no idea what that detail should be
