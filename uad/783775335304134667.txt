help 2023-02-06 01:16:22 My tutorial jet's motor locked front wings don't motor lock. after launching, they just go to their unlocked form. the first image shows the settings for the first sets of motors, and the second shows the placements. this wasn't happening before, and the rear wings don't unlock like the front wongs. please tell me what's wrong :/
