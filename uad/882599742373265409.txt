bot-central 2022-01-16 12:06:41 ?shelp
bot-central 2022-01-16 12:21:05 &suggest Map expansion because this map is too small and revamp blocks such as lights and motors. Why are lights just blocks like bruh. And add a scale tool/circle 7x7, 10x10, etc sizes. Oh yeah and please fix motor2 and make it have a LOCK function like motor. It is not good to launch a build to have your motor2 have 2 torque. And the changelog has also not been updated since the summer update. the conclusion: fix motor2 having 2 torque when launch and add bigger part sizes. and also add a feature that allows you to resize the node of some blocks.

plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:33:35 The Boeing 737 Max 10 has been fin
general 2022-06-15 17:58:04 pov: the plane works
general 2022-06-15 18:01:36 I still gotta figure out what wingspan I need
general 2022-06-15 18:01:39 Wide or long?
general 2022-06-15 18:01:53 and how to make proper wings out of blocks
general 2022-06-15 18:02:13 But it's 2 am now so I should sleep
general 2022-06-15 18:02:19 3 folds
general 2022-06-16 06:47:06 I slept yesterday but its wings are folded and have reached the height limit so I folded them again. That’s 2 folds on the main wings. The actual plane body is 2 folds and takes up basically the entire plot. All 2 folds are on the same height. It’s not stacked. And there’s three parts.
general 2022-06-16 06:48:39 Length is about the plot plus another…30%
general 2022-06-16 06:48:49 Yes
general 2022-06-16 06:49:13 It’s roughly 130-145%
general 2022-06-16 06:49:27 2 and a half maybe
general 2022-06-16 06:49:35 This is a very rough measurement
general 2022-06-16 06:50:29 Wing root? You mean the length of where it’s attached to the body?
general 2022-06-16 06:50:48 Yeah I’m pretty sure it’s half a plot
general 2022-06-16 06:56:05 Pov: 🏛

plane-crazy 2022-06-16 09:12:20 is there any way to undo a save that doesn't undo the most recent one?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 09:12:26 or did I lose my boeing lol
help 2022-06-16 09:13:10 How do I undo multiple saves because I'm an idiot and saved it in the wrong slot

plane-crazy 2022-06-16 10:21:08 the highlight is instead of using a disconnector outside the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 10:21:11 the bombs are inside
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 10:21:19 and a hatch opens
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 10:21:36 there are four sets of bombs which drop and explode via the keys 1, 2, 3, 4

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:22:56 Is the tail wing too tall?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:23:11 Not the rear horizontal wings, the vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:24:07 It's not, just the angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:24:14 it's actually like a weird cone at the end
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:24:23 but let's ignore that for now
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 08:32:59 cope
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 09:59:27 I m ea n.. it's possible but not gonna fly the best
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 10:01:51 Nope. Unless you hide the wings inside, in which, unless the plane is super fat, it won't fly properly compared to normal wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 10:01:56 Go try for yourself

general 2023-01-20 15:07:02 It's not a permanent solution and the flying disk is definitely better
general 2023-01-20 15:07:10 but this is something you can deploy instantly
general 2023-01-20 15:07:26 it was a different build
