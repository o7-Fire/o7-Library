plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:05:26 before anybody says that
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:10:15 deserves it
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:19:12 built the obese goose from castle in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:19:14 still need to paint it
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:19:51 but after turning on motor lock for the front propeller things they dont get out of sync anymore and send me spiraling into the void
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:19:56 so she flies alright
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:20:45 the tail could be longer but i dont feel like doing some weird fold stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:20:56 which ones
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:21:21 i didnt want to use rocket engines and i still dont like how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:21:27 so honestly i probably will change it
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:21:38 but i wanted the propellers to be able to throttle
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:21:44 not just be an on/off
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 23:22:00 ** **

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:43:49 it used to have a giant anchor
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:43:57 that was fun to play around with
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:44:07 snagging onto unsuspecting aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:44:25 but giant fans are funny and cool

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:49:37 its pretty agile
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:49:42 beats shredders to a pulp
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:50:07 
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:50:19 its not huge because i dont want it to lag in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:50:46 like if i really wanted to i could make an oversized jet or something with motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:50:55 but i dont really have much of a reason to do so
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:51:06 yeah i agree
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:51:39 heres a motor lock railgun
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:51:41 shoots things at like
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:51:48 i think almost 3000 m/s?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:51:57 i have a stripped down version too
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:52:02 cuz it doesnt jam as much
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:52:04 lag is like
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:52:07 my worst enemy
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 21:52:15 oh my god shut up11!!1!!1!!1!!11!!
creations-chat 2021-02-10 04:11:27 some more edits (smokestacks and stuff)
is there anything else i should add?

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 22:25:13 PAIN
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 22:25:15 ðŸ¤®
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:27:48 added some more smokestacks to really drive in the steampunk feeling, does it look good? what else should I add?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:31:11 also those little wings on the back go apeshit when i move them backwards into the position they are supposed to be in, causing me to revert a lot. If i get lucky they wont cause me much trouble and i'll be able to fly, but is there any way to fix this?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:34:32 <@!719168864705052802> theres 1 motor for moving them into the proper position and 1 motor2 for pitch control on each wing
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:36:36 also here she is in flight
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:38:37 <@!719168864705052802> well what else am I supposed to do then? I don't have more building space or anything
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:23:40 added some extra sails, looks cooler imo
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:27:51 the smoke really gives it away that shes laggy as hell though
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:35:20 landing is smooth if you can stay at a high altitude
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:39:40 its an airship, it doesnt really care if its aerodynamic or not, plus it isnt made to go at very high speeds (although it does anyways)
creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:10:05 contest thing ive been working on, going for a steampunk theme, dont really know what else to add but I want it to have more details, please give me ideas ðŸ¥º (will post more screenshots when SMELLY slowmode is gone)
creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:12:41 cant embed with snipping tool, gonna just post screenshots in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:13:07 side view of thing ive been working on (check <#504436696021204992> for context)
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:13:19 back
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:13:35 angled
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:13:41 uh thats probably all ill post
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:14:25 the only issue i have is that the front and back propellers get out of sync (the back two stay together and the front two stay together, but both groups are out of sync)
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:14:31 idk what is causing that
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 19:14:43 I'm thinking something is colliding with another thing?

creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:25:38 yeah but i want to add *m o r e*

but i dont know what to add
creations-chat 2021-02-15 20:28:27 it does fly, although I cant do anything too crazy or else it will essentially capsize in the air
creations-chat 2021-02-16 00:38:38 good idea
creations-chat 2021-02-16 17:54:02 added some guns, made some more yaw and roll surfaces (turns faster in the water now), polished a few things, this *could* be the final version (might add one or two more things but im not sure) I'd like some actual consecutive criticism instead of "oh that looks really good" even though i still appreciate those comments, I just want to know what is dragging the build down if that makes sense i guess
creations-chat 2021-02-16 17:57:51 yeah but like what part looks the best? what looks the worst? what can i do to make the worst part look better? thats sorta what im looking for (sorry if the tone sounds a bit mean, I just want some better criticism)
creations-chat 2021-02-16 18:07:15 Ill work on this next, thanks for the suggestion
creations-chat 2021-02-17 16:34:18 oh shoot my creation is one vote away from 100, didnt really expect that many people to like it
creations-chat 2021-02-17 16:53:47 awesome, but i'd be surprised if it gets any stars now
general 2021-11-24 19:19:17 ???
general 2021-11-24 19:19:23 what happened
general 2021-11-24 19:19:39 is somebody impersonating me
bot-central 2022-03-08 04:43:34 !rank
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:19:51 for the people who downvoted my post (https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/951723040742469662), I'd like to know why you didn't like it so I could make improvements, any criticism helps!
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:27:02 yeah, it's more similar to the 70's version than the reboot version, only noticed that when i was done with the hull so i just went with it
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:29:40 what's wrong with the nose shape, and what do you think I could do to make it look more appealing?
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:33:24 It technically has two "noses," if you're talking about the red one it's supposed to be perfectly round, and the other one above is supposed to be pointier, which is difficult to do at such a small scale but i can try to figure that out
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:37:41 I've never experimented with camera locking but I'll give it a go
creations-chat 2022-03-11 07:19:49 i know the proportions are all messed up i just decided to not do anything about it because i only noticed after completing the hull, maybe eventually i'll just make a new one but ive put too much work into this one to go back and fix proportions
creations-chat 2022-03-11 13:51:39 the yamato is a bit chunkier than people expect but still longer than what i made, also yes ive watched the series 2 times and am currently on my third watch through

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 03:56:59 it can and usually will player kill if the player is not well protected
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 03:57:49 https://streamable.com/sr98cx ok but then its not cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 04:31:49 ok but im not making a missile
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 04:32:03 its supposed to be a wave motion gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 04:32:13 i
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 04:32:14 do not
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 04:32:15 care
general 2022-09-11 18:53:13 piston should be a key that you wont ever press
general 2022-09-11 18:53:15 but otherwise yeah
general 2022-09-11 18:55:33 half piston should be touching the main thing and anchor block should be touching nothing except for half piston
general 2022-09-11 18:56:49 wym
general 2022-09-11 18:57:16 yes thats whats supposed to happen
general 2022-09-11 18:58:14 you'd need somebody to confirm it but the easiest way is to have a motor on toggle mode and set to spin with the same key as the anchor block
general 2022-09-11 18:58:19 so whenever its not spinning is when its working
creations-chat 2022-10-11 21:48:54 it uses magnets which shoot a projectile with a bunch of TNT blocks locked into a compact shape which i can release to spread the shot when its close to the target for maximum damage dispersal
