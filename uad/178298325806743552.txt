bug-reports 2019-04-30 18:43:41 I keep getting kicked for unexpected client behavior when I try to unfold my Space Shuttle. Essentially what I do is unfold half of the build, magnet, unfold the other half, and then magnet. In the process of using magnets on the second half is when I get kicked.

`Note`
In order to make the Falcon 1 to scale, I had to make compromises. For one, there is no disconnector. The second stage just isn't held in.
I also would've been unable to make the fairing fall off without making the second stage ugly.

general 2021-05-03 23:04:01 when it's at 10,000 meters up it does a loop around the space center and lands pointing down at 19 degrees
general 2021-05-03 23:04:02 that?
general 2021-05-03 23:04:35 not me, space shuttles run on methane
general 2021-05-03 23:04:37 not nitrogen
general 2021-05-03 23:05:01 no that's KSP
general 2021-05-03 23:05:07 the rs-25 runs on methalox
general 2021-05-03 23:05:11 methane and liquid oxygen
