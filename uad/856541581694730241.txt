plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:37:17 i tried to build the JU-88 but i failed miserably
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:37:29 the thing that messes me up the most is always the landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:38:05 are there actual "wheels"on there tho?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:38:34 coooooooll
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:39:33 one big problem i have with plane crazy at the moment is that the cylinders are always in the wrong size
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:40:09 i mean like 1x1 would be too small but the 2x2 is just a tad too big
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 19:40:44 no in pc2
