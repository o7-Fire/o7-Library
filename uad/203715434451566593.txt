The Tale of faunusvilky (203715434451566593)
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 00:26:53 So. I have a actual question. I have a plane that uses the german cross. Is that okay? ( It's not the Swastika. )
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 00:27:12 Oh good. Okay.
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 00:29:11 Casually trying to get a good picture of this thing.
creations-chat 2019-05-27 00:34:22 Amalgamation - FaunusVilky - 723 Blocks - I don't mind, Any
creations-chat 2019-05-27 00:34:41 Wait. Ouch. It doesn't show the name.

creations-chat 2019-05-27 00:36:22 Should I also have one for it flying oooor?
creations-chat 2019-05-27 09:06:30 I haven't thought of one truthfully as of now so it's just Amalgamation.
creations-chat 2019-05-27 09:07:02 Thank you.
creations-chat 2019-06-24 20:07:35 Cough. It's a remodel of a Spitfire with no Prop. It's about 383 Blocks in all.
creations-chat 2019-06-24 20:08:05 
creations-chat 2019-06-24 21:12:10 Thanks, And I mean. The wings are a weak point, Yeah. I'll probably try and rework it soon honestly. Including more space for the lift.
help 2019-06-28 22:03:11 So. I wanna make some more realistic looking tanks. Does anyone have any tips or something?
help 2019-06-28 22:03:52 Mostly with the tracks and turret.
help 2019-06-28 22:13:46 Hm?
help 2020-07-17 19:07:59 So, I turned all my sound and everything on, Yet my Speaker is making no noise? Could it be the Code not compatible.
help 2020-07-17 19:09:43 Yeah
help 2020-07-17 19:10:01 Right.
help 2020-07-17 19:13:22 Anyone know if there's any ID's guaranteed to work?
help 2020-07-17 19:26:42 Well hell. I can hear the Speaker now but I have to be right next to it
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:48:24 Are you sure?
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:48:35 *Thought so*
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:49:00 HI
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:49:13 Yes
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:49:59 I questioned you because I can uwu
creations-chat 2020-07-19 02:51:53 Wow, Wish I could make stuff like that ;00
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:08:56 Gove him hell.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:09:00 He deserves it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:09:08 Never.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:09:16 Hoe
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:09:49 I think you're just trying to up my F-16
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:10:13 Your F-14 is hot garbage
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:10:38 *It's okay, This dummy is rude*
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:11:08 We don't need to say sorry for mutual hatred
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:12:15 Can we waterboard them
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:12:34 *Please*
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:12:51 Give me more information
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:13:21 Thank you.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:13:31 I did
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:13:49 But please keep going and show me one you have built perhaps?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:14:15 I always have one, It's not new!
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:15:14 Oh goodness, This nerd is a scumboot.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:16:08 My A-10's are as close as I could get. Plus they're old now-
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:16:27 I could retry some time.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:16:58 Perhaps! But sure, Sure
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:18:26 I recommend trying!
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:18:55 Also I could lower the wings to a 1 x 2 but eh.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:19:27 Coolio, Bro!
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:19:35 Keep goin'
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:21:15 Accuracy is meh when you can just like whag you like
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:21:58 Your nose is big
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:25:17 God twin engines are weird
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:25:43 Not hate, Despise with plenty of passion
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:27:19 You're just mad because you rush into engagements like big brain ruskie
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:28:11 You like to show everyone your sides
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:28:40 *I recommend not when the side armor is thin af*
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:29:23 Take it like a man and blow them sky high with well placed calm shots
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:30:43 My first custom planr was a Heinkel fusion that waz too good at PVP
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:31:05 Don't make me make my Leopard fly
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:31:49 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:31:57 No u
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:32:33 Terrible
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:32:57 He needs the electric chair. They abused my orange.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:33:44 No
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:33:53 I happen to like it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:34:16 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:34:56 I may delete Ivan's coffin though
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:35:19 Well yes but no
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:35:43 Me
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:36:13 I'd build the dicker max but. It's confusing and gives me second thoughts about life
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:36:32 True
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:37:45 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:37:53 But I recommend dying too
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:38:40 Only if you make it sad
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:38:50 It can be happy
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:40:02 Oh?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:40:13 Is thag what I'm doing tomorrow?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:40:35 Sure
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:41:07 Or my Avatar at times
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:41:51 Double furro, Loudener. Predator laser, And a pistol or stubby grip
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:42:51 I tried but it wouldn't help. It'd be stupidly OP.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:43:07 Not even subpar good
creations-chat 2020-08-02 10:44:12 God
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:01:36 I recommend making it less blocky! Organic shapes can help a lot with builds
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:08:38 Bud, Inaccurate? Very kind of you to think it that way! Though. It is fairly as accurate as I could. It portrays the shape and looks close! Plus it's for fun.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:08:53 Taking it so seriously is rather meh?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:10:22 Would you like to make an F-16 and show me how it's done?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:13:44 Thank you!
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:17:21 Pyeo is taking my F-16 too seriously.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:19:24 I love making planes and shit, My dude. It's taken seriously to thd point of it looking nice! Inaccuracies shouldn't matter when it's just wings.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:20:30 What says low effort about my build?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:21:08 I don't take it seriously but I still try-
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:22:27 Someone who isn't taking it 'seriously' wouldn't spend three days reworking and making a build only to be slammed by a man that takes the game like a bible.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:23:26 Three days because I have a life and take breaks.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:23:47 My F-16 is trash and Pyro is mad
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:24:20 Sure!
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:26:23 Honestly it all bubbles down to a man not liking how big my wings are. Guess he got offended by their size ;3
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:27:37 Back to stuff that matters!
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:27:54 Anyone got ideas on how to do frontal plating for a panther?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:29:32 I asked a legitimate question
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:30:29 Its frontal plate is such a weird angle. 1 x 2?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:30:51 You're welcome
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:32:16 Is that a MILK TRUCK
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:32:52 Perhaps make stupid tanks to use against me
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:33:36 In pain and screaming
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:34:26 The tiger is terrible. Its turret is maliscious
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:36:09 The frontal slope is atrocious. The Leopard 2's designers need to be executed
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:37:09 That's exactly what I did
creations-chat 2020-08-03 06:40:45 I recommend using trails for your atenna! It's a lot thinner.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:21:57 Put shredders on a low effort build in PVP and watch the world burn
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:22:19 *That I did*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:23:27 Ooooh. I really only seen one, But then again I haven't been in PVP much.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:23:53 I play it for the migraines
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:25:02 I'm working on a fictional battleship currently and I can't get the shape correct
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:26:13 Are shredders the new stationary turrets?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:28:59 I've never really done a naval battle, Just blindly tap fired from above in a ME 262
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:31:45 Imagine not having a private server
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:32:37 *It's only 10 robux for a damn private server-*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:33:14 And you can't tell me that'd destroy you in a race.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:33:45 I should probably do that eventually
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:36:55 The general populace scares me
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:38:35 Omagine making only Water Bottles. But no Water Jugs
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:40:34 *Cries in not knowing how to make complex suspension*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:41:15 Imagine
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:42:54 I updated my Tiger 1 to appeal to the common simpleton. Would anyone like to see?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:43:43 
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:44:56 Why does yours not say it?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:45:37 In order to appeal to the common man you need to disgrace the Panzer gods
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:45:54 *Oh shit*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:46:26 What's a good camouflage scheme for a Tiger 1
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:47:04 Just paint it tan and boom, It's done
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:48:55 Ssssh, Don't tell them that
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:44:01 Don't make accurate builds unless you're sure the engine is running at the same speed of the real one to the exact number
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:46:39 I try at times but eh.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:58:10 That was a joke! May not have been funny, But yes
creations-chat 2020-09-20 22:33:56 People who use all the weapons have no legitimate say in their fate.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 18:59:15 Skirted tanks make me sad
creations-chat 2020-09-22 18:59:51 Show off the return rollers
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:00:24 Doing rears for modern tanks is so boring.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:01:01 Make a Chaffee with the high velocity 60mm gun
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:01:33 Yup
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:01:51 I think the 60mm is a Chilean export too.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:02:36 Nice!
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:03:19 Oh man. Is it too short?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:04:14 *Not gonna lie recognizing Russian MBT's is like trying to distinguish twins*
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:05:21 You could try to shorten the frontal plate maybe
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:06:25 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:07:54 This is. Problematic
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:08:43 Oh god.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:09:27 Has any big brain tried to make torsion bar suspension.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:10:18 It's the standard that modern tanks use. Or well, Most.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:11:47 In WWII suspension was more varied in Tanks.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:13:28 All my tanks don't use treads because they scare me.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:15:09 For my E-100 what would be a good track to use?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:15:41 Yee
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:16:10 I was going to make a Maus but the road wheels offended me
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:16:52 *Laughs in death*
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:18:16 
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:18:57 
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:19:05 These wheels killed me
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:20:08 I don't fuck with the Tigers muzzle brake. That's German space magic.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:20:55 tech mi plez
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:21:17 Oh god oh no
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:22:12 The fucc is a rank
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:23:54 The Toyota tank haunts my fever dreams
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:24:59 That's actually pretty cool
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:25:26 Just put a dShka on it
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:25:44 That's your turret
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:26:31 You know what? Just put an AK-47 on it and ship it off
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:27:50 Is the tanks turret round like a T-64 but like. Sharp?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:28:35 That's smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:29:25 That'd be cool
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:29:32 Derp, But cool
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:30:27 They're ascending
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:31:54 Swede boi go up and down
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:37:53 The only build I'm truly happy with is my tiger. But currently it's painted pink and I'm too lazy to repaint it.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:38:39 *I lost braincells*
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:39:03 You made a Swedish door wedge
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:40:46 Abrams turrets give me death
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:41:08 Choichhell
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:41:23 That's stylish though.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:42:21 Japanese tanks are just boxes with hand moved turrets, Prove me wrong.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:43:05 It baffles me.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:43:36 Make it not too wide, Dud
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:43:52 Damn that is a tall boy
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:45:26 The russians have logs just to dampen theif sick kick flips and wheelies in their tanks.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:46:33 Make a Lada with oversized tank tracks
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:47:01 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:47:41 Just make the Calliope but Russian Civilian.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:48:15 Yee
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:49:16 Big hm
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:51:51 I can't. Russian turrets are a thing that needs to be reverse engineered
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:52:37 I could probably do a T-34 or a KV. But that's out of my league
creations-chat 2020-09-22 22:09:14 Anyone have any good track set ups? I've seen some.
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:21:54 Fancy chassis
creations-chat 2020-09-28 16:53:57 A Chrysler TV-8?
creations-chat 2020-09-28 16:54:25 *Have fun*

creations-chat 2020-09-28 18:46:29 *My current WIP is killing me, I too am making a ship. But it's huge and I don't know how to process it.
creations-chat 2020-09-28 18:47:21 My hull is huge. I can probably do an interior.
creations-chat 2020-09-28 18:48:12 Tonight I'm going to try and power through the last tier of the superstructure. Mine's full custom.
creations-chat 2020-09-28 18:58:41 I can never get Helicopters- Planes? Fine. Land vehicles? Perfect.
creations-chat 2020-09-29 03:35:03 It's official. No more Kawaii Tiger.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:51:10 OwO T-Tank-San! What're you doing with your 120mm cannon!?
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:51:35 You're welcome!
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:52:08 *Gotta have some fun sometimes*
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:54:49 I don't control the rate at which Aistrikes happen sadly. Only the rate at which braincells die
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:55:45 I could do the Neko A-10 but I need to update mine extremely
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:56:35 My Tiger used to be close to a Neko but I just unweebed it-
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:57:12 I HAD TO. The Pink camo and striped barrel made me slowly hate myself
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:58:07 Make it a dog, They like water
creations-chat 2020-09-30 02:59:12 Swain Cat
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:00:56 First person to make a Fanfic out of Signs in Plane Crazy wins.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:04:27 *Shoot, Can't say that-*
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:05:32 Big whoops. Anyone have a good solution to Tiger muzzle brakes?
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:06:15 Thank you for the input even then!
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:07:10 I just put a deactivated rocket engine on mine-
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:08:53 To shoot extra far, Duh
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:10:18 BT-7 but it does backflips every shot
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:11:43 If your tank doesn't have a 300mm shell, I don't want it.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:12:49 Neko B-17
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:13:36 Make Japan into a Mech.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 03:15:14 That'd be a lot of pink
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:09:39 That looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:10:40 Try it
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:12:04 You have done big brain
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:13:16 Swashy
