plane-crazy 2020-06-16 20:07:06 It could be nice, if there will come some glider physics, so we can make a glider without a motor! ðŸ˜„  And then make a winch or tow-plane... It could be nice too, if there will come a feature that do, that you can connect a tow to others planes (if both players accept it), so it'll be possible to tow a glider up in the air! ðŸ˜„ (and make feature that will show the glide-ratio of the plane made! ðŸ˜„

creations-chat 2020-09-27 20:13:36 Someone made a glider?
help 2020-09-27 20:16:02 Someone made a glider?
help 2020-09-27 20:17:26 exactly... lol
help 2020-09-27 20:17:59 It could be nice, if more realistic physics could find place in Plane Crazy
help 2020-09-27 20:18:27 Let's make a demonstration lol

help 2020-09-27 20:19:39 We want..... More realistic........ PHYSICS!! for gliders
help 2020-09-27 20:19:59 wind could be nice tho
help 2020-09-27 20:20:46 I'll hope there will be a possibility to make non-powered gliders as soon as possible
help 2020-09-27 20:21:20 so a hover plane?
help 2020-09-27 20:21:31 or hover car, formed as a plane
help 2020-09-27 20:21:45 shÃ¸t happens
help 2020-09-27 20:23:46 conrad
help 2020-09-27 20:23:57 Conrad is a nice name
help 2020-09-27 20:24:17 but the wings even not produce enough drag to make gliders lol
help 2020-09-27 20:24:33 looooool
help 2020-09-27 20:24:35 trueeeee
help 2020-09-27 20:24:37 saaaadly

help 2020-09-27 20:48:31 <@!591064764248096770> make a beamblock, and put som control surfaces on it, where ever you want... After that, place a seat, and you're ready to fly superfast.... Oh i forgot you have to put super engines on it! ðŸ˜‰
