help 2021-03-18 18:19:06 Anyone know why I can't put pictures into the creations channel?
help 2021-03-18 18:22:02 Which rank would that be?
help 2021-03-18 18:22:52 Yes, now the only issue with that is.
help 2021-03-18 18:23:07 To get that rank you need to submit creations do you not?
help 2021-03-18 18:25:07 As long as you have a creation that meets the requirements I assume.
help 2021-03-18 19:12:31 I had some suspicions, because I've posted creations in the past, and sense I've rejoined I've been incapable of doing so.
