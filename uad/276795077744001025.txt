plane-crazy 2020-12-13 17:00:55 im so confused
general 2020-12-13 17:02:54 is it normal for a conveyer engine to make me spin?
general 2020-12-13 17:03:35 guys please
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 22:42:27 Bikes are so hard to make
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 22:42:31 Especially to scale
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:57:38 What is that???
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:58:19 I see a cage
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:58:40 Oh damn is that the enterprise?

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:04:35 What are you making?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:05:58 What're the white things?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:09:23 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:09:27 That looks complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:30:40 That's complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:31:23 How tf do yall build such complicated builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:31:35 They are
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:31:39 Look at that image
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:31:46 How am I supposed to make that
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:32:45 Tf is a motor 2???
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:34:26 This would be 10x easier if we could limit motor rotation to an angle
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:34:39 And I still have no clue what a motor 2 is
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:34:44 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:35:25 Because it looks weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:35:33 And I don't want to touch it
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:35:44 That yellow thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:36:21 Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:36:24 Tf is a servo
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:36:43 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:36:51 Because I build things that aren't complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:36:58 I am a simple man with simple needs
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:37:28 I didn't even know what a conveyer engine was until 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:37:40 It still won't work
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:37:46 Yeah screw tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:39:44 Screw tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:41:00 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:41:06 They aren't simple
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:41:09 Timings and stucf
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:41:11 Stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:41:54 Dear God scrap mechanic is 10x better
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:42:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:42:08 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:42:38 I'M SORRY BUT THAT IS COMPLEX
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:42:57 As someone who cannot use their legs that is complex
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:43:27 The fuck is a motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:43:54 Like
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:43:58 2 years on and off
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:44:18 What???
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:44:31 NO IT LOOKS TOO COMPLICATED
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:44:40 IT'S GOT THAT YELLOW THING
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:44:46 I'M BEING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:02 Nerd
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:15 Better
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:18 Less complex
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:30 Look at it
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:38 Do you see any motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:43 It's just angles
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:47 Easy
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:45:55 Just angles
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:46:02 Oh shit a robot
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:46:39 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:46:47 Angles

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:48:14 My goal for Christmas is to learn what a motor 2 is
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:48:20 Until my pc arrives
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:48:33 When I can actually play scrap mechanic again
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:49:04 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:49:07 Tf is that
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:49:59 Bruh why is that so complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:50:40 I've literally built 2 decent things
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:50:54 1 being a batmobile that doesn't use wheels but just hovers
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:51:07 The other is an x wing that doesn't even fly straight
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:51:40 No it's fine
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:51:42 It just dips
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:51:53 Like
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:51:57 The nose is too flat
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:52:00 Wait no
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:52:03 The nose is too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:52:33 It looks like the back to the future city on wheels
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:52:49 Does anyone know how to make hover wheels
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:52:53 That angle down to hover
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:53:09 Because I want to make a delorean
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:53:40 It is
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:54:00 Trails didn't even exist when I started
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:54:18 Simpler times
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:54:23 Uhh
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:54:37 How did you break textures
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:54:53 It is???
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:57:33 Why is everyone so toxic then?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:58:48 Maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:59:05 They should provide people with constrictive criticism
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:59:10 Instead of calling them an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 00:59:30 In the literal past half hour I have been called an idiot multiple times
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:00:03 You've all called me an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:00:10 Of course I wanna learn
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:00:20 It just looks complicated
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:01:29 I know what motor locking is
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:01:35 I just press the lock option???
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:01:52 Somewhere
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:01:59 In the innovation hq I think
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:02:10 Click lock and stop inputs
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:02:23 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:02:27 Doesn't seem that way
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 01:03:18 Alright bye losers
