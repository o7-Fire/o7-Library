plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:36:07 2 hours later I have no choice actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:36:25 dont worry about it
creations-chat 2019-08-05 23:31:15 Body of the front half finished. Not painted yet. Construction of the body and mechanisms for the back half starts next. Painting and basic interior after that.
creations-chat 2019-08-05 23:58:27 Forgot mirrors so I added mirrors that come out and should be adjustable.
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:25:11 Finished the rear body and the wing
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:29:23 I think it became a hybrid
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:29:48 and it's a bit long
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:31:45 I *was* looking at one:1 references for the mid and back
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:32:00 dunno what even happened with the front
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:48:15 Edited the rear wing a bit. Made it the double wing it's supposed to be. I also cut a massive hold in the back so I can attempt to make the engine.
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:56:22 I got 15 upvotes for the first pic of my mega scale car a while ago
creations-chat 2019-08-08 09:00:05 yeah I wasn't expecting it in the first place but then the votes went downhill fast
creations-chat 2019-08-08 09:00:39 I think googly's thing is pretty good looking as long as it can fly properely

creations-chat 2019-08-08 22:44:11 My brother is putting thanos decals on a purple pickup on Forza XD
creations-chat 2019-08-08 23:53:15 Done most of my interior and got a working steering wheel too. Seats and I'm done the interior and start the engine.
creations-chat 2019-08-09 01:39:48 <@!429665143677255681> should I make it a size smaller?

creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:02:07 what does lock even do on pistons?
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:08 that doesn't make sense though to lock them in their starting positions
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:39 ...
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:11:28 what part of the piston is what moves everything?

creations-chat 2020-05-01 04:05:13 I don't care if anyone downvotes it it's simple designing
creations-chat 2020-05-01 04:06:26 it still is almost double my previous rocket
creations-chat 2020-05-01 04:06:42 which means more painful fold
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 04:07:53 How much will having a motor on only one side of a rocket affect stability?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 04:08:41 <#478584971670454284>
help 2020-05-01 04:09:04 How much will a motor on one side of a rocket affect stability?

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:11:34 Is it a bad idea to go straight for Mad Scientist rank without a basic rocket scientist rank?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:11:55 great time to burn my brain
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:18:42 Big dreams, weird head

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:03:21 Think this is overkill length for rocket legs?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:03:57 as the chat goes silent...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:04:54 alright thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:06:06 This is what it looks like deployed btw

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:21:39 Looks like you're better than me at building
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:22:06 and I like the mech from earlier
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:22:40 <@!410992368494575626> <#609442446249820211>

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:24:37 looks good there from my judgements which aren't accurate
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:25:24 I just took a decent side shot and measured height to length ratio
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:25:44 kudos? no clue what that means but thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:26:18 and the ranks is where you can find more ranks to achieve
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:26:35 don't remember how I got my designer rank but I think it was a mega car

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:34 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:36 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:36:06 what do you mean by replicas?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:37:28 not at all I believe
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:37:54 people make all sorts of unique, custom and crazy things
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:38:18 even inventions
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:38:57 True
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:05 wut
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:17 I've seen worse though
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:40:06 I suck at making scaled things
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:40:33 though to be honest my last scaled was pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:41:18 I can't make planes in a game that literally has "plane" in its name
help 2020-05-01 06:54:08 I actually went counting out of the people online to get a sense of the difficulty of pulling it off and sounds easy but seems hard af
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:43:03 make the middle rounder maybe
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:44:38 I'm gonna need links...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:45:18 now, time for the all nighter engineering to begin
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:47:04 nah they're practically identical
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:47:16 can't tell if it's going forward or reverse
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:48:34 a bit flatter?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:00:36 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:00:43 me and my legs
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:01:55 Cause I was doing other stuff and I finally got to get the legs done
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:02:43 Also, my legs might be a bit overkill
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:06:04 mines is at 2 and my pc dies every once in a while
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:06:40 my iPod can barely handle this game
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:08:21 fps cap unlocker and mega good pc
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:11:43 Wonder that voxel would say about this
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:12:20 the pole in the corner is the build box height
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:21:57 Apparently I've already used 700 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:35:48 My save went from 500 and a bit to 1.5k and a bit
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:40:03 Apparently 16 super thrusters and 1 huge thruster can't lift 500 blocks combination of halfs and wedges
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:57:01 When you realize your creation is 1 block too tall
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:57:30 #frustration

creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:37:58 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 Hours so far?

plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:26 Massive Rocket
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:31 Basically a Falcon Heavy
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:39:51 I can almost bet something will go wrong in folding
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:40:33 also, to answer your question from earlier, I don't know what it is I need references
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:14:54 What's with the paint?

creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:31:54 well, I mean it is

creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:53:50 This is what I have so far
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:54:28 Anyone think I can pull off propulsive landings with these massive boosters?
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:54:30 and basically

creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:55:41 I didn't make the bottom thrusters how it should be but basically it is a FH
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:56:44 This is what the bottom looks like
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:57:18 so not FH on the bottom but how it works wise it is a FH
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:57:38 I might need to remake the landing gear
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:58:01 it's so hard when you only have 2 blocks of space between the boosters
creations-chat 2020-05-03 21:00:45 That won't be too hard
creations-chat 2020-05-03 21:18:54 Should I just remove the legs and make the bottom accurate while making better legs?
creations-chat 2020-05-03 21:25:44 ^

help 2020-11-14 04:16:20 Hmm... does speed mean upwards or does it count if it's sideways...
help 2020-11-14 04:19:50 Sps in any direction as long as it's not separated?
help 2020-11-14 04:20:06 And is powered by engines?
help 2020-11-14 04:21:49 It's a rocket so it does technically pitch over but that's technically not going against gravity...

help 2020-11-14 04:25:03 Oks with the uh slingshot thing...
help 2020-11-14 04:25:52 I was gonna say if you want reuse, use magnets. If not, use suspension and set the length to max or smth with disconnectors
help 2020-11-14 04:26:33 I'm still debating if I should post it now or hold till it isn't buckling mid flight
help 2020-11-14 04:50:37 Does anyone know how to do a seamless 180 degree fold?
help 2020-11-14 04:51:47 Motorlock... it's kind of hard to move a lock motor on an anchored creation tho

help 2020-11-14 04:54:20 I'm trying to plan out how to build a mega starship but I don't want to be using double folds like on my Falcon 9 cause the folds keep buckling
help 2020-11-14 04:55:26 Yeah it just infolds itself
help 2020-11-14 04:55:40 I even have fold locks inside and still does it
help 2020-11-14 04:56:11 It's impossible to fold it because I have to anchor

help 2021-07-04 21:42:25 I'm trying to make a gimbal system for my rocket's engines, but the motors are shaky and unstable, I have limited space, and the engines are 4 sets of 36 super rocket engines which makes them really powerful. The vehicle is also a bit shaky cause I have other things on motors which are locked. How can I make a gimbal system that's smooth, stable and has the strength to turn and maintain angles on the engines?
help 2021-07-04 21:43:11 normal motors directly on the engines doesn't really work cause it isn't stable or smooth
