creations-chat 2020-11-25 21:46:12 
creations-chat 2020-11-25 21:47:43 Also what should I name the ship?
creations-chat 2020-11-26 02:42:17 Anyone have any cool names for this ship?
creations-chat 2020-12-05 01:20:25 How’s my S class No Man’s Sky ship?
creations-chat 2020-12-05 01:23:05 It’s small because in game the ship is also small. I also used motor locking
creations-chat 2020-12-05 01:30:33 Updated version
creations-chat 2020-12-05 01:35:01 Updated version. Should I post this? Will it get me upvotes?

creations-chat 2020-12-05 15:10:43 I don’t know how my S class no mans sky ship got so many upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-12-06 00:44:12 I finally added landing gear!
creations-chat 2020-12-06 03:22:01 I landed my ship in the facility.
creations-chat 2020-12-06 03:24:51 It’s small and green . It’s on a small pedestal by the door. Entrance is in the desert cave.
creations-chat 2021-01-13 21:09:31 Potential name suggestions:

Paladin
Aegis 
Behemoth
Judgement 
Warden

Feel free to use these sample names if you wish
creations-chat 2021-01-13 21:12:07 I would agree, plus the tank is heavily armored, like a paladin getting ready for battle. The gold and white colors give a holy vibe, similar to how many paladins fought for good

creations-chat 2021-06-20 17:41:39 I have a question
creations-chat 2021-06-20 17:43:41 Do you have to hide motors if they are meant to rotate a part? Like a wing for example?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 18:00:28 I have a question. If you’re using motors to rotate items, like a wing, does it have to be hidden?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 18:02:31 So would this be acceptable?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 18:34:16 How does this small motor-lock starship look?

creations-chat 2021-06-20 19:45:15 Comments on color scheme?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 19:55:19 
creations-chat 2021-06-20 19:58:57 Added purple stripes
creations-chat 2021-06-20 20:43:24 I just figured out that using sparklers on motorlocked gun makes a very convincing aircraft gun
creations-chat 2021-06-21 21:23:38 Looks pretty good
