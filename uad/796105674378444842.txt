general 2022-02-11 04:19:25 sing to the poor
general 2022-02-13 22:39:43 Uhm random question, do you guys know if there's a chance of adding a rotate tool sometime in the future?
general 2022-02-13 22:40:03 Just cuz I don't wanna make a suggestion that has already been said no to multiple times
general 2022-02-13 22:40:34 Ik, but for the whole build?
general 2022-02-13 22:41:49 Ig, but let's say I wanna build a rocket, a space shuttle or smthin like that and that I don't have no jetpack
general 2022-02-13 22:42:17 It'd be a lot less annoying to just build it horizontally without having to tower if you guys see what I mean
general 2022-02-13 22:44:39 Ye I mean I started liek 3 days ago so I kinda don't yet have the ambition to build mega rockets lol
