bug-reports 2021-02-11 14:24:20 there is a bug that makes metals and heavier materials not sink - this makes it difficult to build large deep draft boats.

bug-reports 2021-02-11 20:05:24 It bothers me that if I have a helicopter propeller that has 10 motor blocks, when it spins, everything shakes and disappears
bug-reports 2021-02-11 20:09:36 I've had other helicopters as well and for the most part it was ok. Is this due to a lot of motor blocks for one prop?
bug-reports 2021-02-11 20:16:27 so that the propeller would work more or less realistically and I could make more precise movements
