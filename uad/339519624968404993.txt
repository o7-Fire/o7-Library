plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:50:34 I could make some bots here if you wanted
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:50:40 kinda empty ;p
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:56:11 you know how to script them?
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:58:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:58:34 but to create your own
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:58:36 you know that?
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 16:59:49 *aha, found something I can do*
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 17:01:02 I need to go now
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 17:01:11 I'll see you.. tomorrow I guess
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:39:58 something weird's going on, all servers just shut down with the message of all servers being shut down by game developer
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:40:02 there's no update
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:40:19 some guy's spamming jets though
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:40:43 yet madattak is offline
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:42:12 I think it's a roblox thing
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 19:42:19 the website is not loading
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 20:05:48 k done a bit of looking around
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 20:05:55 and almost every game is doing it
plane-crazy 2017-11-25 20:06:18 probs won't last, and if you're reading this, it must be in the future
plane-crazy 2017-11-26 21:24:20 nailed advertising:
plane-crazy 2017-11-26 21:42:25 no one's taking the hint ._.

plane-crazy 2018-02-08 18:51:12 just met some fucking idiot trying to claim his regular vtol was a scientific gem because it had hardly any wings and went about 10 speed faster than normal planes

plane-crazy 2018-02-27 22:45:30 Alright, starting a basic wiki I can direct newbies to when they get confused. I've done one page so far( http://plane-crazy.wikia.com/wiki/Parts ), please do add more
plane-crazy 2018-02-28 23:30:20 just finished a basic plane building guide

plane-crazy 2018-03-05 16:08:54 okten
plane-crazy 2018-03-05 20:16:45 yep
plane-crazy 2018-03-06 21:10:30 oy ya'll, I just had a chat with mad (he finally came ingame) and he says he'll consider handing over the game to someone
plane-crazy 2018-03-06 21:10:44 if anyone here's good at scripting, now's the time to tell him
plane-crazy 2018-03-07 15:57:32 only if you're really good
plane-crazy 2018-03-07 15:57:55 apparently the code's really badly documented and complicated
plane-crazy 2018-03-07 15:58:22 which is why I'm not taking it, I would probably mess it up
plane-crazy 2018-04-28 10:09:08 HEY
plane-crazy 2018-04-28 10:09:12 guys
plane-crazy 2018-04-28 10:09:22 BREAKING NEWS

plane-crazy 2018-08-03 16:53:23 i'm keeping track of his studio page but haven't found anything
plane-crazy 2018-08-03 16:54:18 kinda given up now, because he's getting a job
plane-crazy 2018-08-03 16:54:53 and yeah, i have a copy of the place(thanks mad) but i have no way to publicize any changes
plane-crazy 2018-08-03 16:55:32 it's really sad, this is one of the highest quality games on roblox
plane-crazy 2018-08-13 15:27:36 or remove front lift or add back lift
plane-crazy 2018-08-16 18:08:50 back from the USA, jet lagged as hell right now though so probably won't be on for a while.
plane-crazy 2018-08-16 18:09:41 and yah that was for future reference..
plane-crazy 2018-08-17 13:11:07 also <@!252094891448860673> may I invite a friend that occasionally plays plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2018-08-17 16:36:09 good question
plane-crazy 2018-08-17 17:55:48 idk.
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:49:31 nah, not our game :p
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:50:28 uh, hang on
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:50:49 what the hell has been happening while I was away?
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:51:48 MAD... UPDATED THE GAME?
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:54:26 hekk... I would get on now but just got back and it's almost 1 o clock :[
plane-crazy 2018-09-03 23:55:06 thats fantastic though. shows mad might noy abandon it after all
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 14:45:02 
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 14:45:21 (i'm the guy on the left btw, i didn't build the titanoof)
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 21:54:02 i just spent around 4 hours building a submarine with 32 different control keys. i REALLY hope that this glitch or whatever is not consistent
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 21:54:25 almost 2k parts by now - _-
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:07:42 yah, and torps
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:08:04 i have no idea how to get it to the water though..
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:11:10 that would mean id need more engines to submerge
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:11:26 i think i might just slide it around
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:11:34 the helium i mean.
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:17:02 anyone could spam a bunch of blocks though
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:22:48 all you need for that is wheels, and just about anything will float tbh
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:26:16 or put any combination of any blocks on water :p
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:26:32 i saw a car bouncing around on water today
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:27:51 i flew 400 part 'literal bird' into water
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:30:29 yeah, i want to do that once i finish my sub
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:30:59 i want to make a smaller propeller plane with completely retractable gear
plane-crazy 2018-09-04 23:31:17 then use gear on land and retract it on water
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 16:09:21 do inventors automatically become moderators or something?
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 16:09:56 i see
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 18:53:00 anyone have any methods of submerging a submarine?
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 18:53:02 ._.
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 18:53:12 i tried about 40 downward pointing engines
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 18:53:14 but nothing
plane-crazy 2018-09-05 19:15:34 my to do list

plane-crazy 2018-09-05 19:19:09 i did build that 1.2k part sub but it refuses to go underwater

plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:43:53 lmao

plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:51:53 i say... yes.
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:52:18 ah crap, i'm sleeping with the light on today
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:53:44 *thinking*
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:54:07 🤔 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:55:06 perhaps this one would do you better?
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:55:55 oh god, it's beginning
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 12:58:50 hmmm

plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:07:27 shhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:08:28 dank engine > battleship
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:08:55 
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:14:03 no idea at all why he would act like that!
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:40:17 ah damn, xpertnub has the same amount of ranks as me
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 13:40:23 i must improve!!
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 14:59:44 madattak online if you want to join, people
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 15:26:13 Madattak has stated that if he's going to do anything with plane crazy, it's going to be a complete rewrite, and he doesn't think he'll do that, so I doubt we'll be getting any more updates. However, he also said he's created a prototype for a factory building game and he might go forward with it, so keep a lookout.
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 15:26:22 
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 16:00:51 yah
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:28:42 if anything game breaking comes along, madattak will most likely fix it
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:28:49 like when the delete bug happened
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:29:10 also i looked at a version he gave me from about 6 months ago and the interface is broken
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:30:33 so
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:30:34 yah
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:38:28 rip ;c
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:38:38 i know the feeling
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:38:49 i've lost multiple 500+ creations to misclicks
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:39:02 and 1.1k to corruption
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:39:18 hoow many?
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:39:34 ouch
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:40:49 hey, just take a break. come on again when you feel like it, but i wouldn't quit completely
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:43:30 if you're going to take a hiatus, i might as well ask if you know a game called factorio?
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:43:54 i reccommend you try it, really high quality
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:44:10 it's about building factories
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:44:49 alright
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:46:37 it's worth it
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:46:47 there's a demo btw
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 19:47:07 aw well
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 15:22:04 mouse over it
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 15:51:21 ...
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 19:26:44 yah kiwi was apparently spamming @ everyone
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 19:26:54 or more likely not kiwi but a sibling
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 15:46:53 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 20:39:22 sigh
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:47:37 <@!328211681274494976> check <#473249376223887371> for what you have to do to unlock certain ranks
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:48:35 then submit a pic of your build flying or floating or whatever it needs to be doing in <#466656485582045184>
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:49:48 xpert isn't too picky, just send a picture of it flying and proof it has XYZ function or show it ingame
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:50:05 my friend calls you potat..
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:52:20 i wanted to call myself Idra but that name wasn't available
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:52:34 and i have had 0 robux for several years now, don't intend to change that
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:53:28 i can imagine
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:53:40 i'd say more 200ish
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:54:03 yay light jazz
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:54:05 and no
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:54:08 not at all
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:54:35 *forums vanish*
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:55:39 i read stuff on them, found it interesting to see the stupid things people talked about, but otherwise didn't do much there
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:56:43 it was extremely funny when they said that the forum merge would make the forums easier to moderate and it triggered a huge spam of messages the first day it happened
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:56:51 something like 5 threads per second
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:57:20 nah a few months later
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:58:16 personally i used to script but kinda stopped because of the whole thing surrounding filteringenabled
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:58:25 and i didn't have too much motivation
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:59:11 i'd make a space building sandboxx
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:59:24 with factories, electrical systems and... PHYSICS!
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:59:34 nah more futuristics
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:59:46 yeah, i'd make a plane crazy with logic systems
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 21:59:50 like gates and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:00:49 yah, but i had a peek into the source file of the game and it's no wonder madattak wants to rewrite it
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:01:13 good workspace organisation, but the scripting is messy as hell
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:01:28 and physics kinda innefficient
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:01:33 yeah, he found a job
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:01:46 he expected it to be good, but apparently it's just 'boring computer work'
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:02:06 and yeah he said he'd created a prototype for a factory building game
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:02:10 a VERY efficient one
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:02:17 which would be extremely interesting
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:02:53 the problem is with popularity on roblox
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:03:26 8yo's
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:04:44 idk if any of you play factorio, but it has a much older fanbase and i occasionally imagine the raging and frustration that would happen if the entire roblox playerbase moved to it
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:05:00 mhm, i was suggested by a friend in 2014-2015
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:06:05 personally I used to play minecraft as well, trying to stick to the more mature side and found the smaller servers were much quieter
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:06:25 i still have an ambition to finally figure out how to make plugins for it
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:07:04 *cough* dan- i can't finish it *cough*
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:07:12 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:07:26 IN COME THE BIG BOIS
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:07:59 *hides in uk*
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:09:42 .
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:14:42 i don't think cryptic is in
plane-crazy 2018-09-11 22:15:36 you saw nothing
plane-crazy 2018-09-12 15:08:40 that looks good
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:05:17 why'd you remove the shipbuilding ranks?
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:29:22 you can build any creation capable of taking off and landing vertically to get that rank
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:29:48 right now thats pretty much all there is to it
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:29:58 its a vtol building rank
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:30:39 yah, that's just xperts wording, heh
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:32:15 i built a sub that needed 40 keys to operate. i took it to the see and it went down about two blocks lower than it eould floating
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:32:32 i would need hundreds of engines to make it submerge
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:32:39 so I just gave up
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:33:29 i don't really do floating stuff, I'm more a vtol guy
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:35:04 i generally go for looks too, but it usually isn't too hard  to get them flying properly
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:36:53 I'm going to vote at the last moment
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:37:12 so i have all the submissions to vote on
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:37:25 I'll submit some of my own too
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:38:14 oh hek
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:38:22 that's a pretty good idea
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:38:45 ima take the lead and make a huge pogo stick
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 06:39:01 with springs.
plane-crazy 2018-09-16 13:11:29 no, i already tried
plane-crazy 2018-09-16 13:14:15 i think he just does't want to be pinged all day about a game he isn't developing any more
plane-crazy 2018-09-16 17:03:49 has anyone tried using helium to make planes fly in formation?
plane-crazy 2018-09-16 17:04:14 this will be fun
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:40:45 welcome, maddy
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:40:59 also, guys, i wouldn't ping him like mad if I were you ;p
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:41:38 he's not developing plane crazy any more, so i don't think we should ping him about it
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:45:32 but i think that i'm going to have to keep a lookout on mad's role count >:C
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:45:40 i don't want to lose my position ~>:)
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 18:30:17 mad be nub
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 18:30:20 mhm
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:03:50 so one of our neighbours has two cars
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:04:04 and he's alternating the one he parks in front of our house all the time
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:04:16 so while he uses one of them, he parks the other in front of our house
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:04:20 it's super irritating
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:04:35 i need a method of setting off an alarm when it moves
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 19:04:38 suggestions? go...
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:34:06 and the FE thing
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:35:13 i meant they forced filtering enabled onto games
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:36:06 no. i didn't mean that
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:36:22 filtering enabled is a sort of mode on games
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:36:39 that stop a lot of client server communication
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:37:01 which makes scripting ridiculously hard for most beginners
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:37:15 so now a lot of people just give up scripting altogether
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:37:22 when they start
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:37:36 because it's so bloody hard
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:37:40 indeed
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:40:17 it's so damn hard to script with though, especially if you used experimental like you said. they should make it easier if they're going to force it
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:42:40 that ^^^ is exactly what happens
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 21:01:28 disconnecter?
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 21:01:34 LET'S GO
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 21:02:00 FIRE THE MISSILES

help 2018-09-23 17:13:06 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
help 2018-09-23 17:14:22 xpert told me mods are able to
help 2018-09-23 17:14:27 but yeah, i suspect they can't

plane-crazy 2018-09-24 20:43:49 https://www.roblox.com/games/1681493376/Plane-Crazy-ALT-Place i made some lights using a copy of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2018-09-24 20:44:02 and need to test if they work cross client
plane-crazy 2018-09-24 20:51:19 nvm, got it tested
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 15:08:13 WHO IS A-PING ME?
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 16:23:50 😠
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 17:14:57 WELL DONE.
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 17:15:01 wait, you play ksp?
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 17:48:18 if you guys got any good screenshots send em to me
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 17:48:27 i want some material to edit
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 18:35:34 w e l c o m e jameson
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:27:47 .
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:27:53 propeller blades?
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:28:03 yah
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 16:46:35 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 17:08:08 it's basically a propeller blade. shove it on top of a motor
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 17:11:01 guess i won't ping everyone ;/
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 17:13:26 propellers, that's all
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 17:13:49 lemme join. one mo
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:34:30 that was a few days before he updated it xD
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:34:37 idk, i guess he changed his mind
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:35:12 probably not.
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:35:32 oh btw rickje thinks he might have found some ways to loosen up lag after looking through the code
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:37:01 me and rickje have a copy of the place but madattak says he'd rather we didn't distribute it
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:37:21 and the code is pretty complex, at least it seems to me
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:38:57 his main problem with the code
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:39:03 is that it is NOT flexible at all
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:39:20 it's just not very good at getting modified
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:39:32 he'd need to rewrite large chunks of code to modify alot of stuff
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:39:46 and so he doesn't really want to work on it any more
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 19:55:51 screenies pl0x
plane-crazy 2018-09-27 06:18:51 Welcome y'all
help 2018-09-27 15:05:41 and *please* don't ping madattak because someone is copying your creation ;-;
help 2018-09-27 22:23:53 haha RIP
plane-crazy 2018-09-27 22:39:23 Welcome! ;)
plane-crazy 2018-09-28 19:44:05 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-09-28 19:46:47 there's no way that 'admin' is actually an admin. for a start, it IS possible to get around FE by using remote events - i don't know the details but there are many hacks out there that can bypass it. most of them cost money though. the profile looks like it's supposed to be 'evidence' that he's a moderator, as it appears he is one in several groups.
plane-crazy 2018-09-28 19:46:54 (pinned msgs)
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 09:21:25 only madattak can ban people
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 09:21:29 basically, no
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 10:03:09 well done.
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:05:35 may i ask what the fuck is happening?
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:06:16 mad what have you done?!?!?!?
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:06:58 ik
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:07:11 but *what is going on?*
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:07:30 oh, alright
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:43:39 i think i just invented a warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:43:46 lemme get  a video, this is insane
plane-crazy 2018-09-29 20:58:00 allow me to ride along with that ping
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 07:35:32 my first 1k part creation got corrupted
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 07:35:39 i got angry at mad, then moved on
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 07:47:54 lmao RIP
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 10:41:51 glass won't go into the arena
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 10:42:03 not sure about propellers and other new components
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:07:28 
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:07:40 that rope needed pinning
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:07:50 hope mad sees it
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:21:47 
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:33:39 might be about*
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:33:44 he said only a prototype
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 20:33:53 also he said it'd be like factorio
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 17:38:41 who ghost pinged me? >:C
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 17:58:24 huh, nice work. i hope mad sees that
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 18:30:16 <@!412694102006824960> that probably means the server is out of date, not your client. it'll need to restart before you can join
help 2018-10-02 14:58:22 please stop keeping your design 'secrets' to yourself. when I uncover something new, i don't go into a private server and keep it all to myself - I tell people about it and how to use it. there is honestly no point in keeping creations and designs to yourself - if someone 'steals' it then why on earth is it a problem?
plane-crazy 2018-10-02 14:59:09 not anymore
help 2018-10-02 16:11:46 i'm not deciding whether you share it or not. i'm just saying it's a rash and illogical thing to do with no point to it
help 2018-10-02 16:13:21 i know, i just really disapprove of it... i hate it when people do that.
help 2018-10-02 16:13:49 i mean, the 'tech level' of plane crazy didn't evolve because of people who didn't share concepts with one another
help 2018-10-02 16:15:19 what? i'm not trying to force you to share your creation
help 2018-10-02 16:15:40 i belive it's 8 or 9
help 2018-10-02 16:22:27 yes, the height at which you die. heh
help 2018-10-02 16:22:33 so no, not really
help 2018-10-02 16:22:53 engines
help 2018-10-02 16:23:12 i think you can to go down

help 2018-10-02 16:31:53 helium is basically an acceleration block
help 2018-10-02 16:32:02 but it can only accelerate upwards
help 2018-10-02 16:41:46 well, i guess i won't share my design secrets with you

plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:09:01 <@!252094891448860673> this guy needs manual verification, it can be done through the !update command on rover
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:09:05 help us out?
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:10:14 chanmged his role to verified, he might show up on tag list now

plane-crazy 2018-10-06 08:01:13 in my opinion, copying is generally fine, but if someone starts posing it as their own, that's just beyond lazy
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:31:26 rick basically made a bunch of amazing things for plane crazy and sent them to mad
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:31:28 so no
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:48:57 to clarify
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:49:08 mad didn't specifically say he'd update the game
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:49:12 (at least to my knowledge)
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 09:49:16 but it's likely he will
help 2018-10-06 12:32:20 we don't know
help 2018-10-06 12:32:26 when it's gonna be released
help 2018-10-06 12:32:35 rick sent mad a bunch of parts and things he made
help 2018-10-06 12:32:44 but we don't know what mad is doing with them
the-dump 2018-10-06 19:38:21 hyperant?
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:36 yes this guy is really toxic
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:47 this is clearly going to be happening a lot from now on
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:51 only on the discord
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:54 a moderatpr
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:17:04 there is a admin script but only mad has access
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:17:36 i really miss the older days when people had civil conversations
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:17:41 instead of

the-dump 2018-10-06 20:18:27 i mean, i'd log on and greet whoever was on and there'd be some sort of conversation about aerodynamics or the like
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:18:35 now screaming 9yos ;/
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:00 good point, which probably means we should NOT ban him
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:09 they'll just get angrier
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:14 and probs get revenge on an alt

plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:31:30 https://www.roblox.com/games/10705224/Build-Your-Own-Mech-DEEP-CONSTRUCTION
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:35:35 the problem is you'd have to have recieving code on his pc
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:36:00 and you'd have to get it there in the first place
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:36:04 with FE in place
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:36:41 well.... it doesn't really stop exploiters
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:36:51 and is stupidly hard to code with, or at least learn to code with
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:37:01 in fact i just quit scripting because of FE
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:40:01 you do?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:40:11 i learnt without fe
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:40:19 and i just can't figure out how to even start with it
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:16:19 oh hey, i'm an admin now?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:16:22 thanks xpert
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:20:24 nice work with the ranks, xpert
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:31:22 last time xpert handed out mod roles he said it was 'because he needed a few mods'
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:31:26 so who knows xD
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:34:25 oooh yes, that's very nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:40:20 you should add a ----Special----- section for the special ranks
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 09:09:45 *eye rolling*
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 09:15:57 how on earth did an an argument start over such a tiny spelling mistake
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:50 the scrollbar for the normal blocks section needs extending
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 15:40:06 thanks to rickje
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 16:27:44 WIP
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:33:40 colours appear to sometimes load incorrectly
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:33:46 like, alter slightly
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:35:27 for example I used 40,40,40
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:35:36 and got something more like 20,20,40
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:41:30 can't roblox convert Color3's to BrickColors?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:41:43 direectly?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:45:22 couldn't you make it more efficient by getting the colours of the blocks and only saving one hex value for each color on the craft? then giving each block a two letter identifier and loading the colors according to that?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:02 so like, if a craft has [255, 255, 255] and [0, 0, 0]
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:20 and those are the only colors on all of its blocks
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:40 no i didn't mean like that
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:59 so say, my carrier has [255, 255, 255] and [0, 0, 0] on it
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:07 those are the only two colors i put on the craft
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:28 it saves those colors to storage and labels them with two letters, for example black it labels HG and white FV
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:57 and every black block gets assigned the letters HG and every white gets labelled FV
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:07 then when it's loaded, it just loads the data for those two colors
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:20 and it paints all the blocks according to their two letter code
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:51 it would allow for 676 different colors on a craft with only two letters, too
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:51:42 what do you think? it would decrease the amount of data you'd have to use by several times
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:51:51 so you could save colors accurately
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:04:53 i see that FE is doing its job
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:07:09 btw did you people realise?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:07:19 can make railguns now! ;D
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:07:32 no more old fashioned engines on blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:07:46 disconnectors and magnets
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 17:15:35 ok, so it is....
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:34:59 propellers are actually the most space efficient engines, i believe
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:23:38 i made a fully functional railgun a few hours back
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:32:52 build a normal turret with raising and turning capability
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:33:16 then put a magnet on top of it, two block above anything else
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:33:33 then attach diconnectors to the front of the magnet and bind each one to a seperate key
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:34:01 then fire each one in turn while the magnet(which should be full strength and range) from the furthest from the magnet to the closest
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:37:08 no i deleted it
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:05:33 h
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:06:48 r
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 20:34:01 welcome fonkl! c;
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:15:14 yeah, i did script a light block at one point
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:15:20 problem is it was handled serverside
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:15:27 so none of that ingame
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:35:48 if any of you work with studio and have a spare moment, could you get a copy of this place and give me opinions about it? i want to know what ya'll want in terms of terrain
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:35:49 https://www.roblox.com/games/2463675509/Plane-Crazy-Terrain-Modifications
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:48:37 you have to take a copy of it and open it in studio
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:48:49 if you were to normally play it you'd be walking for hours
bug-reports 2018-10-08 21:54:22 (that one only appeared recently)
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:56:40 wings that curve forwar
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:56:58 
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:57:03 a bit like this
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:57:53 oooo scifi
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:57:56 i love scifi#
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 22:27:10 the first pic.
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:03:45 not really
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:04:07 but no one can ban anyone else except for mad
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:04:19 so it is, frankly, a free for all
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:04:27 roblox couldn't care less
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:04:36 as long as jailbreak lives on
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:04:50 that's roblox for you
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:05:11 in what?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:05:52 oh. roblox issued them, orwfyb mods?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:06:13 i guessed as much
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:07:04 yep
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:07:22 so it remains a ffa
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 23:12:32 yah
bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:41:12 i find it annoying to fix those sorts of bugs because there is no try catch function in lua
the-dump 2018-10-10 17:40:53 ...
the-dump 2018-10-10 17:41:38 ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:44:49 also is down arrow for 'i would hate it' or 'no, go ahead'
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:45:47 tbh i think you need to implement 'custom' color codes
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:46:09 it would solve so many color related problems
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:47:46 no no no
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:47:49 i didn't mean that
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:48:23 i meant that it's assigned a *random* color code every time one is needed and the color codes are saved with the rest of the data, bonded to the RGB value of that color code
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:49:04 so it's like, instead of calling a olive a olive, call it [O]
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:49:09 and then write that down somewhere
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:49:20 and when you need to refer to an olive
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 17:49:30 then use the reference by 'loading' it from the paper
the-dump 2018-10-10 17:51:32 ...
the-dump 2018-10-10 18:11:24 ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:45:07 wdym?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:45:25 brickcolors can't save all RGB values
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:45:36 like you said there are a stupid amount of combinations
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:46:15 that isn't what i mean...
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:46:36 ok so, imagine I have [255, 255, 255] which is white
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:46:47 and that is the only color on the craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:47:17 what the saving system does is export those three numbers, but also exports them with *two completely random letters*
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:47:37 and each single white block is tagged with *those two letters*
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:47:47 get it now?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:49:29 hrrrrrrr
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:49:54 the two letters are generated when the save function is activated
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:49:57 there is no set lis
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:50:31 develop somehting first ._.
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:51:00 *for plane crazy?*
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:51:33 you get it now rick? there is a generator that makes random letters
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 18:51:38 it's not from a set list
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 20:50:18 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 21:05:58 hi
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:26:07 well yes, maybe a week ago suddenly about 40 players started playing the game simultaneously
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:26:16 and since then it's just kept at 20-30
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:26:24 i have no idea what happened
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:26:52 oh yes, and rickje started making updates since a few of us have the source file of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:27:02 great stuff so far
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:47:05 mad uncopylocked the place for an hour or two
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:47:24 and I did ask him if I could distribute it
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:47:37 but he said he'd rather I didn't
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:49:14 my words were something like 'may I distribute the game file to whoever asks for it? '
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:49:25 so to be honest I don't know
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 22:50:12 in any case I'm not on PC right now so I can't give you the file:/
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:34:40 'Roblox users can expect to join games faster and have an overall better game experience on mobile platforms as the company integrates PacketZoom’s technology and IP.'
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:34:52 i don't think the person who wrote this knows what IP is ;/
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:35:00 https://blog.roblox.com/2018/10/packetzoom-joins-roblox-family/
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:59:37 it's not about how long you play. keep that in mind
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:59:52 also when did you start playing?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:00:34 orange, it hardly matters how long you've been playing. more important is your personality
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:00:49 i've been with potato since early 2017 lol
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:01:31 yeah, i came a few months before fuel was removed
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:02:31 indeed ^^
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:03:03 i mean, obviously people who have been here longer will be more trustworthy(usually) but that's really quite a small factor
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:03:17 yep, that's a sort of personality ;p
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:14:17 so uh
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:14:21 why are these on my home page?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:14:56 more to the point
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:15:03 why is THIS on my home page
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:15:18 that must be a pretty bad algorithm then
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:15:33 i have never played any sort of fashion related game for a start.
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:15:54 yeah polyguns isn't actually bad
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:16:02 i used to play it once
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:16:11 but then...
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:16:13 'BE A WALL'
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:16:47 i like this though
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:16:54 you can see which friends are on the game
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:17:05 (and that)
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:55:56 i really hope he doesn't any time soon
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 19:56:13 because rick and me just tested it and the save button breaks quite commonly
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:01:03 no
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:01:09 the save button won't do anything
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:01:13 just flat out breaks
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:01:32 also i just found a problem with magnets, they quite commonly randomly stop working
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:19:03 no.
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 20:42:10 w e l c o m e
bug-reports 2018-10-11 20:42:24 actually i just started getting that bug too
bug-reports 2018-10-11 20:42:35 save GUI breaks every time
bug-reports 2018-10-11 20:42:44 too much spacing between the slots for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 21:03:59 ?!
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 21:04:17 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 21:05:14 phew it didn't get updated
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 21:37:31 ^^ though it IS quite hilarious that they seem to think that oxygen = air
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 14:57:48 hoi ye plebs
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 14:57:59 how on earth did plane crazy reach 100 concurrent?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 14:58:41 either it's gaining a ridiculous amount of traction or someone is advertising
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:00:14 me neither
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:00:19 doesn't mean they're not out there
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:00:38 but why'd that get so many people playing?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:00:49 nah i checked front page
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:01:20 i guess we *do* have 116 members
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:01:27 holy crap, we have 116?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:01:32 i remember when it was 3
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:01:54 me too. seems impossible now haha
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:05:43 i wonder if mad is going to reconsider a rewrite after that
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:37:03 yes, what exactly is going on there
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:37:05 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:46:21 widegon?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:46:23 really?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:46:58 i have at least 40 hours on Aegus
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:47:06 (but hate him now)
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:48:27 i know,i know
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:48:36 i have around 300 on factorio
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:48:54 but aegis is a game of progression really. it capped at level 12
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 15:49:03 which isn't that hard to reach
general 2018-10-12 16:14:06 yeah, 300 hours or so
general 2018-10-12 16:14:16 doing a bit o seablock right now
general 2018-10-12 16:14:34 nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:19:46 it means more txoic 9-year olds
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:20:11 unfortunately, popularity has its downsides.
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:36:09 or the community private server
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:36:12 (check pins)
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:36:16 ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:56:11 yes, min fact I found in the .rblx file that he had some sort of script about racing
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:59:09 yep.
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 16:59:29 roblox games seem to be more about roleplay and elements that appeal to, ahem, a younger audience
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:00:20 indeede
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:19:49 so wait a second
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:20:09 helium can make your craft have *negative mass?*
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:20:37 grrrr my keyboard language keeps changing
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:27:03 a what builder?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:52:32 ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 18:11:22 i just realised that arcane adventures was broken
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 18:11:28 that was a pretty good game

plane-crazy 2018-10-13 21:17:11 never seen that on plane crazy before the update
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 21:32:11 hoi
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 22:00:41 nah, i think we'd need more features for that
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 22:00:48 late alpha maybe?
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:17:45 if anyone has had a bug where their creation won't save, please press F9, scroll right down to the bottom and check if there is a error talking about a load script timing out. if there is a error, please tell me. i need more people to confirm this bug so i know whether i should post it in <#490306593242611742> or not. thanks
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:05 yeah i noticed that when i was on rick's test server
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:17 it just subtracts one block from the actual amount of blocks on the craft
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:22 for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 23:48:59 that is huge
bug-reports 2018-10-14 01:09:43 yep, the problem is that if you place a block and then delete it, the move tool will act as if it's still there

plane-crazy 2018-10-14 13:36:54 the hell
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 13:36:56 ARE YOU
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 13:36:59 to have that high ping
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:37:15 yah rick's looking into it
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:37:32 he thinks it just *might* be because of, you know, that 75k line script he put it
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:31 yesterday i thought i had saved the third stage of my saturn V
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:36 and guess what it didn't save
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:40 it even CHANGED THE BLOCK COUNT
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:44 but didn't actually save
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:10 😌
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:33:01 actually there are a *lot* of airports which don't have jetways
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:33:04 they're expensive
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 14:42:27 it got embedded into the terrain for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 14:42:34 so terrain shows through it.
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 14:44:52 rick have you got a tested patch for the creation load/saving problem?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 14:48:05 hoi
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 14:57:12 me neither.
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:07:29 i would prefer if it were left simple
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:07:36 and we had to bring our own equipment
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:19:01 ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:22:35 yeah that looks good
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:24:46 i can't find a new server
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:24:47 grrrrr
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:26:50 i literally cannot fly any creation that i load
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:27:06 i press on the fly button and nothing happens
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:27:12 even though i have a main pilot seat
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:38:20 i tried it on the private server
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:38:22 they work now
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:43:13 or just use the pinned private server
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:43:31 it is now
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:43:37 i'm on it with fonkl
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 15:43:42 saving ten times faster
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 16:25:42 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 16:29:38 the saving got fixed
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 16:37:25 er... which one?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 17:33:56 in that case i bet it's something about communication between client and server
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 17:34:08 because studio test runs it all on your computer
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 17:34:14 at least i think so

plane-crazy 2018-10-17 16:11:50 pilot seats can be switched to
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 16:11:57 so if you get out of your main seat
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 16:12:00 and go to a pilot seat
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 16:12:06 you can control your craft from that seat

general 2018-10-21 16:30:16 mining inc isn't completely broken
general 2018-10-21 16:30:20 just very buggy
general 2018-10-21 16:30:23 and quite laggy
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 18:29:40 congrats on mod, fonkl
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 18:36:24 not like in the movies.
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 19:26:23 wow, nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:16:40 people asking how to build vtols
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:16:42 =fun
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:17:30 the problem with building multiple planes in one plot
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:17:33 is that, well
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:17:55 basically the control surfaces use the centre of mass and lift of the entire creation to calculate their angles
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:18:15 which means if you have a plane on one side of the plot and another plane on the other side
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:18:33 the control surfaces will calculate using the COM and COL that is in the middle of those two planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:18:46 so it'll try to act like one giant plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:18:52 which doesn't work.
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:20:11 that would be fun, yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:20:24 couldn't you just have recorded it? ;c
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:21:52 upload it to youtube

plane-crazy 2018-10-21 22:46:18 i used to daily check xperts ranks to make sure he never had more than me

general 2018-10-23 20:09:14 plane crazy isn't compatible with ipad ;p
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 20:20:46 oh no
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 20:20:50 they're here
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 20:21:57 ofc
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:45:26 cream cheese is madattak tier stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:49:11 use engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:50:05 for pitch, an engine in the back set to W/W and on/off mode and SS in the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:50:20 i think that's right
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:51:41 a.... anthro?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:51:47 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:52:03 um
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:52:08 i
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:52:36 anthro = online daters
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:53:27 tbh anthro isn't as bad as most people thought it would be
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:54:12 but maybe roblox made it seem so incredibly bad on purpose, so when they actually implemented it, everyone would be practically relieved
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:54:30 that's my theory
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:59:13 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:59:51 scroll up, heh
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:01:33 my theory is  maybe roblox made it seem incredibly bad on purpose, so when they actually implemented it, everyone would be practically relieved
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:02:03 because frankly it looked like half the community would quit over it
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:34:33 um
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:35:22 what the hell is that doing in this discord?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:35:27 that...

plane-crazy 2018-10-24 20:14:34 done
bug-reports 2018-10-24 20:16:04 that only happens clientside. you can see the damage but no one else can. ^^^

bug-reports 2018-10-24 21:50:31 it will only do anything at all on your client

bug-reports 2018-10-24 21:50:45 at least to my belief
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 22:38:53 hoi ya plebs
help 2018-10-24 22:48:43 happened to me a few times too. it seems to  be a rare bug, try rejoining, resetting and/or reloading the plane
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:14:43 actually no it can't. brickcolors are 2 digits and RGB is 9 digits, so it would take an obscene amount of precious storage space just to save precise colors
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:22 you checked the brickcolors compared to your RGB?
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:15 btw the default colors on the left are not brickcokors
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:51 that shade of blue is probably just really close to a bridkcolor
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:19:44 http://unofficial-roblox-v2.wikia.com/wiki/BrickColor_Codes
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:19:59 these are brickcolors

plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:10:27 i love it when you're making a tutorial about plane crazy and the editing software crashes and you lose 30minutes of progress
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:10:29 and guess what
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:10:38 you have to ENABLE AUTOSAVE for EACH PROJECT
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:10:42 how stupid is that? lmao
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:11:04 screw this..
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:11:50 i wasn't talking about pc autosave, but the pc autosave just saves your creations when you leave
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 11:11:56 and loads them again on startup

plane-crazy 2018-10-26 15:09:00 no. inventor is a special rank for a reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 15:09:20 you'll have to build an original creation. like, original

plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:23:18 oh no a roblox update
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:23:28 what could happen now?
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:53:41 let me just put this out here - a S/VTOL is a plane capable of short takeoff and landing. that's the official definition, if slightly rephrased.
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:54:04 generally they are able to hover
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:55:03 now, if vipempire doesn't want people to submit VTOLS, he should say so, as things like this are going to start with no point to them. that's all i'm going to say
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:55:06 alright hang on
help 2018-10-26 18:47:17 👌
help 2018-10-26 20:58:10 i don't particularly like robocraft. i played it for a few months but honestly since then have discovered better games. thinking back i think it was just a lack of freedom - you couldn't really design much more than was preset for you.
help 2018-10-26 20:58:16 anyways, hovercraft
help 2018-10-26 20:59:43 basically all you need to do is
1) build a normal plane body/wings, but without engines
2) place 2 motors on either side of your plane. >>> THEY MUST BE ALIGNED WITH THE YELLOW(and preferably blue) LINES <<< [very important]
3) place upward facing engines on those motors
4) configure the motor on the right to be the inverse keybinds of the motor on the left
help 2018-10-26 20:59:51 start small, <30 blocks
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:02:26 ranked
help 2018-10-26 21:24:27 i stayed pretty low down... well, not really. i built planes. plasma bombers upon plasma bombers. screw helicopters.
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:51:40 1) the craft must be 500+ blocks to qualify
2) what on earth is so special about building a straight plane with big wings
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:51:52 you need to build something that has a new mechanism, or something of the sort
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:52:00 inventor rank is special for a reason

the-dump 2018-10-29 21:15:53 frankly i don't think that's a problem. unless ash starts claiming it as his own or something like that, there's no point in taking action
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:12 i've actually copied a few concepts personally that i thought cool, like a interesting walker design i saw in <#384025409945337856>
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:22 but i didn't post them anywhere or claim them as my own
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:27 no.
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:46 is someone trying to claim a copied creation as their own?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:19:53 yes. copying in itself is fine, unless the creator has a really massive problem with it for a good reason, claiming it as your own is not fine.

plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:30:29 i would be able to to it if it wasn't for a glitch that froze my engines at variable higher speeds

general 2018-10-30 16:26:43 so, does anyone know why exactly roblox moved 'my feed' to a ugly looking place no one is ever going to go?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:26:48 w e l c o m e
general 2018-10-30 16:28:01 after forum removal, it's hard to shout at roblox
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:28:17 they tilt according to your mouse's position on the screen
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:28:30 like alerions on a plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:29:38 yah. if you want to build big, use hinge joints
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:39 if you saw the code, you'd understand.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:50 logic gates would be really hard too
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:54 but a lot more worth it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:02 so idk maybe at a later stage
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:27 yep. i imagine autonomous drones
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:00 vtols are really easy to make once you get the hang of them
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:12 in fact by now i can build one easier than i can build a plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:29 eh, i've built and seen many really nice flying vtols
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:34:56 why would you get annoyed at someone asking for a specific rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:04 i miss things if people don't tell me, it's perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:56 no. you *ask* them
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:09 how are we even having this conversation over such a small thing?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:36:18 ima go play some... something
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:09 in my opinion, judges shouldn't be a thing
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:37:21 instead should have a place where a whole community can vote on things
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:38:14 before i found plane crazy i played BYM. level 170, i built vtols and things. good game
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:11:57 wait, future, are you talking about cannons with compressed springs held by disconnectors?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:07 i've fired pretty far with that
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:49 i only built a very small one though.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:36:50 people used to put ratings on most creations
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:37:03 but after the <#384025409945337856> channel got added almost no one does
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:37:16 probably a combination of things
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:38:47 like the fact that you can't see the creator
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:38:56 you don't know who built the thingy
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:39:09 and no discussion in <#384025409945337856> either

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 20:23:04 
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:36:35 large rocket engine, i *think*
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:36:42 but super rockets are much more space efficient
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:37:14 *now you know how de moderators feel*
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:37:19 *aaaahhhh*
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:43:39 sure
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:44:12 not yet. it's in planned features, but there's no whitelisting(or group building) yet
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:44:35 it would be pretty hard to add though, so it might not appear any time soon
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:45:38 yeah, if you could get it to madattak.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:45:43 he's a busy man
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:45:59 friends only, yep
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:46:16 i tested it a few days ago, haha
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:46:43 frankly, no
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:03 if it was good you might be able to send it to rick
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:08 who'd forward it to mad
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:34 👌
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:52 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:51:38 theta, when you press the 'fly' button then does your speed bar turn blue, stay blue and say 'speed' on it?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:18 and it's not working on the occasions that that doesn't happen
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:39 well, are you sure those support struts are not connected to the rocket?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:52 they look like they are
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:53:07 oh yes, lone
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:53:13 my bad
creations-chat 2018-10-30 22:54:08 ranked
creations-chat 2018-10-30 22:54:12 nice work
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:54:34 lone are you sure the struts are not connected to the rocket?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:54:42 they sometimes get stuck, even if they are
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:54:45 oh, it does?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:54:50 huh, idk then
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:55:09 there *might* have been a rocket nerf but i'm not sure

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:08:22 if you have fins at the bottom, put fins at the top
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:08:31 rockets act like planes with aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:08:39 too much lift at the back and it'll tilt forward
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:08:43 it must be balanced
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:08:55 they act slightly differently ofc
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:09:24 👌
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:15:20 Updated

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:15:23 ..?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:19:01 probably a different problem
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:24:10 aaand a round of applause for our very **new** admin
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:26:07 let's compare!
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:26:08 
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:26:41 oh dear
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:26:49 hm, what for?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:27:04 where da proof?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:27:06 show me to it
bug-reports 2018-10-30 23:30:12 nah, it updates in realtime
bug-reports 2018-10-30 23:30:17 when you press it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:31:23 this is your daily reminder
Supersonic Engineer | Achieve Mach 1 (6860 SPS) in a plane or VTOL. Plane must be somewhat controllable in order to qualify (i.e; Able to keep the plane steady.)
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:32:42 the speed indicator stops working at 3860. xd
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:32:45 good luck
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:33:06 i think rick said he'll fix it next update
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:34:14 yeah, it makes no sense but... yah.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:34:15 Studs are also used in measuring. For example, a Robloxian is 5 studs tall. According to a blog post from 2012, 1 meter is equal to 20 Roblox studs, so a stud is 5 centimeters, and a real-life Robloxian (that is 5 studs tall) would be 25 centimeters, about 10 inches tall.
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:35:56 this makes no sense, but then again so do most of roblox's actions
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:36:11 latest update is practically pointless
help 2018-10-31 16:00:48 unless people post a creation that is originally yours and claim it as their own, there really is no point getting aggravated about copying creations. as xpert said it happens all the time, and it doesn't really affect anything

plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:43:07 logic gates would be way harder to add then you might think
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:43:16 the actual logic operations are REALLY easy
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:43:30 but connecting everything up is insanely difficult because of the structure of the scripts
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:45:42 and i should know, i have the games .rblx file. it's outdated af but still has the basic code

help 2018-10-31 22:47:06 alright, i guess
help 2018-10-31 22:47:10 you may have the honor
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:47:43 welcome c;
help 2018-10-31 22:47:48 indeed
help 2018-10-31 22:48:29 my thoughts exactly, actually
help 2018-10-31 22:50:05 but maybe make the first a little larger, then add another layer before that

help 2018-11-01 17:23:46 yah, when i built my saturn V i used split joints and built it lengthwise. then it stood up using large rocket engines
help 2018-11-01 17:23:59 i recommend doing that for larger builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:33:08 h e l l o
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:23:16 i haven't seen any examples so far
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:23:49 yeah, i vote yes for a reset
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:09 this is why we need a #polls channel i've asked a few times but xpert seems to be against it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:45 yeah, i also think it should be for *only new mechanisms* not for new looks
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:53 it's really easy to build, say, a flying apple or whatever
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:06 looks play a big part though
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:26 yeah, only just though, and i didn't want to disappoint him ._.
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:40 and yeah, it is currently for unique looks too
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:38 >puts a bunch of helium blocks in
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:42 >colours them white
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:24 yeah, i really don't think there's be much point in such a feature apart form this
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:35 which one of us?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:28:06 oh. we were just in <#504436696021204992> . oop.
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:28:42 i did
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:28:50 why not?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:28:54 we should have community input
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:34:04 actually yes, he would.
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:35:22 i've seen him on many cases. anyways, the inventor rank was supposed to be a unique rank but a lot of people have been getting it just for unique looks. we were thinking it might be a good idea to switch to unique mechanisms only, but we'd need to reset/go through all ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:42:28 it was meant to be a unique rank... it is no longer
general 2018-11-01 18:47:00 lol, my irl best friend just blocked me on discord because i changed my discord name to his irl name

plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:30:43 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:52:06 he doesn't like that he didn't win, basically
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:52:13 aesthetics account for 90% of the votes
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:52:55 imo the contests should be entirely based around aesthetics and unique functions
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:53:15 zero.
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:53:20 hang on dave
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:55:33 what's the new loadmaster rank for, xpert?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:57:29 what? why shouldn't the community be involved?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:57:31 it seems fair to me
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:59:14 that's fair enough. i think most contests from now are likely going to be based on aesthetics and unique functionality though, so maybe we could try another few contests with the community and see how it goes
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:00 
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:07 what happened there? lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:31 this just the view for people with access to a channel?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:36 never seen that before

plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:04:21 w e l c o m e
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:05:57 ;v that seems harsh
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:10:48 i'm completely against slowmode. it kinda discourages regular chatting... idk why, but it seems to be a psychological sort of thing. perhaps only new people without ranks have slowmode?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:12:48 i'm sure the suggestions will calm down soon
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:18:34 yeah, that'd be good
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:19:43 yes, i've seen that concept before and it seemed to work well
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:21:48 yah, imagine if you could store unlimited data
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:22:33 yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:22:44 it won't
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:22:47 it's too complex
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:23:01 way too complex for the majority of roblox community to comprehend
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:24:49 26 i think
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:17 totally not illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:36 it's about creativity not intelligence tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:48 that *might* be possible
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:53 i think it's legal
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:58 but it'd be quite hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:28:15 from a clientside script it *could* be saved
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:28:21 ***maybe***
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:29:03 applications like, say, google, already store data on your computer
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:29:14 cookies are a good example
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:29:42 e x p l a i n
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:31:41 it's just kinda irritating, really. type like that if you want but it won't help with your social status
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:32:04 i won't say type like this or else i mute you, just a word of advice
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:33:15 🍿 got burnt
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:34:59 there was one time when i tried to build a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:35:09 and instead got something that teleported me to the center of the map
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:35:15 then turned invisible and noncollisable
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:35:36 no

creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:47:28 tbh putting a bunch of helium together isn't really a 'legitimate' way to get the rank
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:47:31 it has to be controllable
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:48:57 it's challenging, not impossible
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:49:01 i might try that one day
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:50:25 oh wait, i misread that, my apologies
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:50:51 still, it needs to be controllable

the-dump 2018-11-02 17:04:04 so i renamed myself to my best friend's irl name

the-dump 2018-11-02 17:04:28 and they had an idea.
the-dump 2018-11-02 18:22:33 it's pretty much a server made by a few of my irl friends, for my irl friends
bug-reports 2018-11-03 09:42:58 that's weird, i think that's the second or third time that glitch has been reported. it just appeared recently, i think
bug-reports 2018-11-03 09:43:22 there's no known fix yet, so you'll have to do a bit of experimentation. sorry ;[

help 2018-11-04 21:28:14 capsules are a bit harder though

help 2018-11-11 23:37:42 not that bug
help 2018-11-11 23:38:01 I've spent at least an hour trying to fix it in various ways
help 2018-11-11 23:38:16 I'm sorry but you'll probably have to rebuild it
help 2018-11-11 23:38:30 happened to a solid 5 of my jets
help 2018-11-11 23:39:17 this isn't a balance problem
help 2018-11-11 23:39:28 it's just a complete glitch
help 2018-11-11 23:39:47 based on practically nothing as far as i see
help 2018-11-11 23:40:52 it just seems to happen randomly with planes
help 2018-11-11 23:41:04 vtols are fine for some reason
help 2018-11-11 23:41:20 and some planes are not attacked by the glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:51:42 goodness me, what on earth happened while i was away?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:52:21 how on earth do you ping an entire server by accident?

plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:22:28 go experiment ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:25:46 it has to be more specific than just a class of aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:26:04 for example you could recreate a B-25 spirit bomber
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:26:17 and get the rank, but not just a similar looking craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:26:52 i think i'm going to try build something for the contest c;

creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:45:01 it's doubled in block size
creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:45:05 and is even spazzier
creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:55:22 technically an admin shouldn't be doing this
creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:55:30 but i found a glitch with the motors that caused them to fling
creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:55:36 then figured out how to harness it
creations-chat 2018-11-26 16:55:44 and it escalated from there
creations-chat 2018-11-26 17:05:29 lmao
creations-chat 2018-11-26 17:05:30 fair enough

creations-chat 2018-11-26 19:06:24 your hourly update on the kraken
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:57:06 alright, pro and i just nearly crashed a server
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:01:27 i built something that could do this, and then i showed it to someone else
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:01:31 what happened was...
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:01:42 well, I sat in his seat and then spawned this in
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:01:51 and the fps dropped to about 0.1
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:01:59 for basically everyone
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:02:34 so for about 3 minutes everyone had the lowest fps i've ever seen
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:02:43 never doing that again
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:46:37 so like...

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:03:32 seriously we nearly crashed a server earlier
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:03:44 pro and me built these weird glitchy structure from ropes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:04:02 and we used the glitch where if you spawn in your creation while sitting in another person's seat...
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:04:05 ahh, fun
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:04:23 seriously though the FPS got down to about 1/4 per second
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:05:07 use the 'spawn at water setting'

creations-chat 2018-11-26 21:20:39 almost the same design, just more wings and motors
creations-chat 2018-11-26 21:20:54 used it for combat and no one could figure out how it went so fast
creations-chat 2018-11-26 21:22:45 turned out tilted engines can boost your speed using some weird thing in the physics engine

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:26:48 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:27:17 never replicate planes at all would be my advice
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:27:29 tbh i just think it's better to come up with your own designs
general 2018-11-26 22:28:31 go
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:48 yes, they'd probably be OP if they did have a longer range seeking ability though
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:54 eh, perhaps the range should be buffed a *bit* but not by much
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:33:49 ***when he realises what's happening***
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:21:34 !changelog
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:23:19 just tried the new building gui, i don't really like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:23:20 at all
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:24:46 i'd prefer a redo
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:25:31 i know, but i think there's a better way to stop it being filled.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:25:58 from the depths for example has something sort of similar to what you have but it's easier to use
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:26:11 the idea is there're sections on the side of the screen, like we have already
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:26:21 then a list of main 'block types'
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:26:36 and some of them are highlighted a different colour
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:26:45 meaning they open a sub-menu with those 'block types'
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:26:25 he has a point, lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:26:34 i just came online and i see this

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:22:05 Legend says, there is a plane crazy server out there that has sentient life living in it. It is a legend passed down through generations, and whether it is even a legend and not a myth is debatable.

help 2018-12-18 22:36:07 yep, wedges are most of the time the best option
help 2018-12-18 22:37:23 might be a good idea to replace the left circled block with a wedge and add a wedge in the right circled space
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:59:32 yes, i'm hugely in favour of ignoring the majority population of roblox, which has no idea how to solve problems or interact with fellow h00man beings and instead developing for the minority

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 11:32:58 Vtols consist of basically vertical engines. they should be approximately in line with the COL and COM to get a stable craft
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 11:33:16 after that it's just normal plane mechanics
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 11:33:33 though there are a couple of different ways to build them

creations-chat 2019-01-04 20:02:15 A bomber I created a few days ago and perfected since. It carries 8 conventional bombs, payload of 2 explosive blocks each. They all immediately point downward when released, meaning extreme accuracy can be achieved. The craft in question
creations-chat 2019-01-04 20:04:30 Here it's shown bombing the airport(yay), as you can see the bombs immediately pointed downward when released. The craft remains stable when one side has dropped its bombs.
creations-chat 2019-01-04 20:05:23 It also includes a bombsight at the front of the craft. It's very accurate, up to 5-10 blocks guaranteed.
creations-chat 2019-01-04 20:05:33 very proud of that thing, spent a while making it just right

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:13:12 idk, i suppose I'm just stuck in prealpha
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:14:46 i just much prefer pointed over rounded noses. so i have to choose between building things i like and building things others like, i suppose. :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:17:55 prefer the pointed one you built over the other two. well, this is annoying.
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:19:36 i'm depressed now that no one likes the style of noses i build, lol

plane-crazy 2019-01-10 15:11:33 balancing varies from craft to craft, it's hard to create a tutorial for something like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:02:14 i know the feeling. i find a general problem is that most people seem to like creations more if there's a real life variant of it - replications often seem more liked than original designs
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:03:44 yes, i mean more designs like very custom planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:05:45 this i might count as an example of an original build
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:06:04 just looks way different

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:54:53 🤦
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:55:29 i reckon soon enough the ping reactiom will be reacted to more than the plane icon
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:55:59 ratio is 90 to 83 as of now xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:57:19 also notice how many people reacted instantly and didn't read the new rules xd always fun to watch this stuff and point out the flaws
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:57:50 oh, we're at 108 to 102
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:59:54 lmao, yep. i predicted correct

general 2019-01-17 21:37:41 🇺🇸  vs  🇬🇧
general 2019-01-17 21:38:13 most things are aligned with significant stars if you look at them the right angle 😉
general 2019-01-17 21:39:08 but in all seriousness, lemme explain something. the probability that a coincidence like this, somewhere, will happen, is larger than the one that will not
general 2019-01-17 21:39:14 wdym no tools??!?
general 2019-01-17 21:39:52 we have perfectly sane explanations as to why pyramids exist tho
general 2019-01-17 21:40:01 so why bother to make not so sane ones?
general 2019-01-17 21:40:24 let me ask you a question
general 2019-01-17 21:40:29 are you 🇺🇸 ?
general 2019-01-17 21:40:34 😤
general 2019-01-17 21:41:20 oh yes, so it is

general 2019-01-17 21:45:43 i'm just starting to realise how weird the suggestions are
general 2019-01-17 21:46:52 seriously. at this point i'm just asking questions
general 2019-01-17 21:47:10 ...about questions...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:47:52 🛢 🇺🇸 ❓
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:48:18 welll... not really
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:49:23 in that case, i wonder why firms all around the world are trying to commercialize it and actually starting to succeed?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:49:35 >.<
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:49:46 ..and that ^^

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:50:25 nuclear fusion. on a ship. have you lost your mind?!
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:05 fusion. fusion is not dangerous
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:12 it's just... big
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:24 *facepalm*
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:52:03 alright, let me tell you something. fusion in stars happens to be dangerous because it's an ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE reaction involving large amounts of extremely dangerous gas
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:52:10 i don't think we do that on earth
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:52:44 you can NOT compare fusion reactors on earth to those in space

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:01:54 that's a problem with roblox, nothing the developers can fix
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:02:07 it happens with any key
help 2019-01-18 19:08:34 in the early days, there were no rules about copying, it was very loose
help 2019-01-18 19:08:50 but we started getting too many complaints and too many arguments were started
help 2019-01-18 19:09:07 so in the end we just had to implement sort-of-official rules around it
help 2019-01-18 19:10:02 and yeah, i must say that don't particularly like how most builds are a copy. there's quite a decline in creativity
help 2019-01-18 19:11:41 when plane crazy was much younger i do remember seeing a lot more original builds. i suppose the painting tool was a little more supportive of replications over original builds

help 2019-01-18 20:25:38 if someone has given permission, of course we won't take action. usually we don't take action either(not that i've seen) if the person getting angry hasn't asked 'can you please not copy my thingy.' we basically made it a rule because so many people actually wanted it as a rule
help 2019-01-18 20:26:31 and yes, plane crazy does have quite a steep learning curve. however i've seen way too many cases of people copying 800-part-creations and in some cases even trying to submit them as their own...

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:47:47 what exactly are you uncomfortable about?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:50:26 there are reasons why your username is the same, not least that we've had multiple occasions of people trying to submit other people's creations as their own.
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:50:42 by knowing your username we can confirm that the build is actually yours
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:50:53 ok bye

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:53:16 you have so far failed to provide a single reason why you should be exempt from nicknames, so yes i suppose i won't carry on the argument. i need to sleep anyway ;c
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:58:31 perfect
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:59:45 control surfaces need to be distributed well. there need to be a reasonable number of control surfaces right at the back of the craft and also in the middle(centre of mass and lift) of the craft
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:59:57 a tail is also favourable
help 2019-01-18 23:04:28 control surfaces coordinate based on the centre of mass/lift of the plane. this means that planes need control surfaces right at the back to be able to pitch, and in the middle to be able to roll
help 2019-01-18 23:04:42 it also means that yawing surfaces are most effective right at the back
help 2019-01-18 23:05:14 send a screenshot
help 2019-01-18 23:05:40 it sounds like your plane doesn't have control surfaces in line with the centre of mass at the middle of the plane to me

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:07:07 well, i suppose this is technological advancement!

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:10:35 but he might have the means to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 23:10:38 we can't have that
help 2019-01-18 23:13:01 oh. that's just the nature of mouse control. it doesn't let your plane go inverted, just points it based on where your mouse is. you can't really get that sort of performance on mouse controls
help 2019-01-18 23:13:17 some people prefer mouse, some prefer keyboard
help 2019-01-18 23:13:58 it's basically because the amount mouse control tilts your surfaces is based on where your mouse is
help 2019-01-18 23:14:06 meaning they're basically never tilted fully
help 2019-01-18 23:14:19 but keyboard control tilts them fully as soon as you press the key
help 2019-01-19 20:42:21 yes
help 2019-01-19 20:42:41 centre of mass under lift is equivalent to centre of mass being in front of centre of lift

help 2019-02-14 23:05:11 depends on the plane. there's  no universal best way, and different people have different opinions... for example i love pointed noses, but a lot of people dislike them. comes down to what you think

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 19:02:05 any block has mass and so will add more weight to wherever you add it, but i recommend normal blocks, wedges and ballasts

bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:13:00 some things can't be fixed simply due to the way the game is coded
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:13:21 well, they can but it'd take a huge amount of effort
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:14:34 and some would just require a total rewrite. which is what we need right now, but mad is the only one with the knowledge to do it who might actually rewrite it, but he's too busy with his jobs and things
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:19:29 although tbh it's a miracle someone figured out how to add on to it. the code's messy, not very well documented.
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:19:55 a lot of it will just remain unmodified forever because no one knows how the hell it works

general 2019-03-01 16:18:42 everyone bugged widgeon for an 'open world' version so he gave out the .rblx file for aegis alpha. needless to say, that didn't really solve our problems
help 2019-03-01 22:53:09 a longer explanation: each block takes up save data based on what numbers it actually needs to save. for example, a normal block or wedge needs to store X, Y and Z in position in the world, its rotation information and 1-4 digits as a BrickColor. a motor will additionally need to save 2-8 digits for colour as it has two parts, and also its settings(powered, speed, torque, controls) and so on

plane-crazy 2019-03-04 20:27:33 i find a bigger problem yet, though, especially in this community. which is the amount of replication 😦
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 20:28:35 it's not necessarily a problem, i just hold low opinions of it, i think that time might be better spent building something original.
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 20:31:54 oh, what i was talking about when i said replication was just things from real life and movies. there's just so much of it. i might not have such a problem with it but i've noticed there's a constant pattern: replications get more upvotes than original builds in almost every case
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 20:47:08 huh? never was

help 2019-03-07 22:30:23 i don't know the exact mechanics, but it's possible there's a delay for locking on, so there's a minimum range as well. not for certain though, it could just be roblox's bad physics or something

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 19:43:44 how do people not hate battle royale, anyways
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 19:43:51 it's shit lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 19:45:55 battle royales are extremely boring. they are basically mostly the same, completely the same concept(at least other genres are broader), don't allow you to actually do much in terms of creative building or anything, are not good for any sort of mental thing except, uh, idk and to top it off are shit
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 19:46:09 thank you and goodnight

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:34:27 why not?
help 2019-03-20 20:35:02 i just couldn't figure out a way to do it
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:35:23 i'd build a new map
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:36:07 imo we NEED a new and bigger map
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:36:57 try sending it to rick in a DM, you never know
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:37:06 yah, that'd be awesome
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:37:22 or we'd do a vote for the map
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:37:58 the main problem with the terrain is there's no way to merge two terrains
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:38:17 like, you can load some terrain in but it'll overwrite your existing terrain
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:38:39 so unless your map was really big you wouldn't stand much chance
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:40:38 i haven't got much experience with building, but i could do a tiny bit of scripting/particles or something if you wanted?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:46:09 i want a river
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:46:20 and hidden lakes
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:48:13 TUNNEL?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:48:21 tunnels = yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:48:25 and planes
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:48:47 and a canyon. a big canyon!
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:48:55 with caves and things!
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:49:07 and bridges so we can throw stuff off
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:49:30 oh, lmao, i do that all the time
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:49:44 WHERE'RE THE TUNNELS
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:49:52 and the canyon
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:50:13 we need canyon WITH TUNNELS. correct. and rivers, and bridges
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:50:23 me too. tunnels!
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:50:59 btw current terrain is the maximium size the generator will go
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:51:06 so you'll have to make the base manually
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:51:22 also we need rivers going out of the lake
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:51:33 wait a sec
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:51:35 i'll find out
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:51:45 using my secret copy of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:52:06 i want to build the rivers
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:52:20 uh, yeah, stuff happened with madattak a year or two ago
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:52:33 so rick/me, maybe a couple other people have a copy of the early game
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:53:31 the size is 1604.1, 28.8, 507.2
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:53:48 of the black thing i mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:53:56 can i script
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:54:16 i haven't scripted in ages. and i'm not that great at it ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:54:27 but i could do lighting or something?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:55:56 wait up a second
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:56:09 rick can't just make the plots bigger
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:56:17 the game's hard-coded
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:56:36 because rick can't just add bigger plots.
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:56:47 10 plots
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:57:42 the game's coded to work with these sizes of plots.
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:57:54 so if you changed the plot size, basically EVERYTHING would break
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:58:15 also, no one knows how the game's code works
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:58:21 i don't think even mad knows lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 20:58:50 nope. the aerodynamics code is literally a rosetta stone, except he can add parts onto it
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:00:19 when are the invites going out? c;
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:01:23 btw, rick is going to load **only the terrain in**
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:01:31 using a loading plugin
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:01:40 it won't save blocks or anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:02:12 wdym?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:02:20 rick doesn't have control over the game btw
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:02:34 and i don't think it can be transferred to him
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:03:22 if you're really curious though, the size of each building plot is 130, 4.7, 130 studs
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:10 studs != blocks btw
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:23 that's just the base block
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:32 the hitbox is defined by a bunch of scripts
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:57 also i demand the new map has this
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:09:14 GET TO WORK, SLAVE! *lashes whip*

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:46:25 with rivers
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:46:43 the plot sizes are decided by rick btw
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:46:51 they're just in there for *reasons*
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:47:09 also we need rivers
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:55:55 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:58:24 the question is
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:58:32 wtf would a shield block actually be
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:02:43 fuel used to be a thing, then it got removed, now it's coming back but toggleable
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:09:08 rivers
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:09:13 a canyon/valley
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:09:26 yah, we need some height in this map
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:09:38 some navigable height
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:12:54 i think lake should remain this size, but have rivers
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:14:12 also, configure the terrain colours
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:14:13 or ban
the-dump 2019-03-20 22:14:18 ban

the-dump 2019-03-27 16:28:57 the reason we don't allow discussions about religion is because more often than not it ends in a heated argument. and since people's minds are very difficult to change, typically it's only ended by intervention.

help 2019-03-29 22:46:57 helium's sole purpose is to reduce weight

help 2019-03-29 22:47:18 helium-wise
help 2019-03-29 22:48:27 one helium = about 8 **normal** blocks worth of lift so you'd want... maybe 20-40 blocks? depends largely on your crafts block composition
help 2019-03-29 22:51:47 i think they reduce *overall* weight btw
help 2019-03-29 22:51:53 so it doesn't matter where you put them
help 2019-03-29 22:52:04 unless that part will be separated
help 2019-03-29 22:52:20 nah, it just reduces overall weight
help 2019-03-29 22:53:38 you'll probably need more than i first suggested tbh

bug-reports 2019-04-05 11:43:48 wait, there's a piston lock?
bug-reports 2019-04-05 11:43:53 oop
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:44:28 rick can't expand plot sizes, full stop. the game's hard coded, designed to work around these size plots
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:44:41 so adding larger plots would require overhaul of a lot of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:44:56 it's not anywhere near as simple as that
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:45:32 you'd have to adjust tons of values and a lot of recoding would be involved.
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:45:47 and mad was the creator and even he hardly knows how the code works anymore...
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:46:54 no, it wouldn't. there's just no way it would be possible
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:47:03 i know because i've seen the code for myself
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:48:06 it was very actively developed once
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:48:13 but mad's real life stuff got in the way
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:48:21 so he pretty much had to drop the project
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:48:40 then rick got his hands on a copy of the code, along with a few others
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:48:43 and here we are
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:49:17 whenever i get my saturn v out for testing, at least one person stands on top while i launch
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:49:25 the good thing is
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:49:32 the top is the launch escape tower. enough said.
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:50:44 if you don't suffer from success, you haven't succeeded >:)
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:50:59 a new what?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:51:05 a new game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:52:10 remaking the game would require massive experience and knowledge, you'd need to know calculations behind aerodynamics and have experience with the UI
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:52:16 it's nowhere near as simple as you think
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 11:55:56 what old code?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 12:17:23 pfft
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:30:11 client lag is FPS lag
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:30:18 server lag is slow motion
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:30:37 the fps lag is because your pc basically can't handle displaying the graphics.
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:31:16 serverside is because the server can't handle the physics/game engine
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:31:37 so it has to slow down time
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:32:51 actually roblox is badly optimized as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:33:25 if stuff runs in slow motion, likely just the server not being able to process everything
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:33:28 nah
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:34:03 bad internet wouldn't make stuff run slow motion... well, it would, just not consistently
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:41:01 the physics calculations are done by the server and the server alone
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:41:19 it's MUCH more efficient than doing those calculations several times over on various client computers
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:41:40 so yeah, i guess internet does play a part in more intense games
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:42:01 what's your internet speed?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:42:13 i play with a good 15MB/s and it's fairly smooth
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 14:42:48 holy shit

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:11:44 it is

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:00 AH
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:01 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:05 beat me to it
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:38 why thinc tat?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:01 you could just make the hitboxes smaller, i reckon
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:37 no, it wouldn't be
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:48 that would require a smaller building grid
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:56 you're confusing hitboxes with the grid
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:08 😦
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:35 ugh, how do I explain this..
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:55 ok

creations-chat 2019-04-17 17:41:29 the ranks were 'redone'
creations-chat 2019-04-17 17:41:59 to be perfectly honest with you, no one could agree on what to do with them
creations-chat 2019-04-17 17:42:04 i wanted task based levelling
creations-chat 2019-04-17 17:42:09 but it was a fairly split vote
creations-chat 2019-04-17 17:42:30 in the end we just left voxel to it...
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:21:26 that would be MUCH harder than you might think
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:21:41 the game's hardcoded. the code is made to work with this size of a grid, in other words
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:21:52 and there are thousands of lines of code in there
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:22:18 it's the same reason we can't have larger building plots ;c
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:23:08 I'd really want something like factorio
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:23:31 i know there's manufactory, but that's still in paid access and in any case, it isn't open world

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:27:31 because modpacks are fun
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:07 it's a 2-year collection
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:10 so not that bad
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:22 no point uninstalling them tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:47 good question. probably a lot, but I'm not having issues
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:29:02 plus, i play them once in a while when i remember 'oh yah that pack was good'

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 09:26:12 i would think not though
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 09:27:51 It says to 'join forces with someone.' I think the point is really to do something cooperative, since you can just make large carriers with folds
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 09:28:29 not for certain though...

help 2019-04-20 23:38:52 cap is just a word in general for limit
help 2019-04-20 23:38:59 or capacity
help 2019-04-20 23:39:21 different aspects take up different save data amounts
help 2019-04-20 23:39:59 for example a normal, unpainted block just needs to save its X Y and Z position
help 2019-04-20 23:40:13 so from 3 to 6 save data
help 2019-04-20 23:40:29 because it takes up 3 to 6 numbers
help 2019-04-20 23:40:43 uh, can't be sure
help 2019-04-20 23:40:49 possibly
help 2019-04-20 23:41:20 yah, question is if it saves the default colour
help 2019-04-20 23:42:12 with functional parts they have to save the settings, so more data
help 2019-04-20 23:42:38 yah, RGB will take 3 to 9 digits, most likely 7 8 or 9
help 2019-04-20 23:42:55 brickcolors will take up 1, 2, mostly 3, or 4

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:10:40 just taking the concept, as inspiration
creations-chat 2019-04-27 14:19:29 the ranks were 'redone' a while back. well, tbh no one could agree on what to do with them so in the end they were just trimmed here and there
creations-chat 2019-04-27 14:19:37 so now a number of ranks are no longer a thing
creations-chat 2019-04-27 14:19:43 not that recently actually
general 2019-04-27 14:40:56 if you figure out a way to make a reusable docking system, PLEASE TELL ME
general 2019-04-27 15:25:25 i've tried already. magnets of course will stay welded once welded, so you need to use a bunch of disconnectors and blocks to be able to use them
general 2019-04-27 15:25:36 pistons are just too hard to use because the target area is so small
general 2019-04-27 15:26:04 i'm desperate for a new idea

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:24:30 *sips tea*
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:25:06 well, obviously not, only blimps from wwii ;p
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:25:51 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:25:57 i meant your american marching band nonsense
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:26:57 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:27:09 parades are ridiculous
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:28:01 yes!
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:29:31 your parades are nonsense. why would you want to go out carrying large chunks of metal and wood, when you can stay at home with the crumpets and tea watching a concert?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 19:30:27 bye noob
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:28:01 !!!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:28:09 it's here
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:30:36 tbh i'd prefer new functions/blocks and things

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:32:19 ✊
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:32:30 rick
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:32:32 we beg you
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:32:35 for logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:32:58 please do tell us what he says
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:34:43 fonkl, i wouldn't make such assumptions about mad
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:35:01 when did you start playing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:35:13 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:35:33 what time period?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:35:43 as in, updates
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:36:11 oh. that was just before the 'dark era' i think
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:36:18 we call it that from now on!
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:36:23 the one with no updates
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:36:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:37:03 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:37:23 i found something in the game's code, disabled, which seemed to be some kind of round-based timer
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:37:51 pretty sure it was going to be a round based fighting game
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:38:19 he might just be on invisible
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:40:46 to be fair, roblox does keep breaking everything
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:45:35 racing game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:45:40 why
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:45:42 **why**
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:45:48 ***why***
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:46:22 he said earlier back he'd created a prototype engine for a factory building game
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:46:47 why would you choose racing over something like that
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:47:09 what if i said
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:47:13 **car games bad**
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:47:31 he said it was 'messily coded, badly documented and hell to work with'
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:48:21 that's...
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:48:27 extremely ambitious
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:49:30 rick, if you rewrite that mass of illegible code
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:49:36 idek any more
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 21:51:10 that's extremely impressive.
help 2019-04-28 12:07:44 <@323414243074506763> keep in mind that control surfaces to the sides will favour rolling, and control surfaces to the back/front will favour pitching. basically put more control surfaces at the back if you want more pitching(therefore sharper turns)
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 12:08:30 i'm not a fan of this contest either
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 12:08:42 it's just another blatant copying competition
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 12:09:08 people seem to be scared to build something original
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 12:11:52 ?!

plane-crazy 2019-04-28 18:36:46 i have a latin assignment due tomorrow. i had the entire easter holidays(2 weeks) to do it, then the due date was pushed back, and guess what
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 18:36:49 i haven't done it
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 18:37:04 really, you're not that bad xD
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 18:37:48 ok i take it back
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:05:38 1.74 FUCKING GIGABYTES?
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:07:43 i have about 8gb 😭
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:08:09 wait lemme check
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:08:40 nevermind, it fucking died and now must trickle charge for 2 hours
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:08:54 ...nevermind, again, it's turning on
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:09:18 i've become used to it randomly using 20% of battery in about two minutes and dying
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:09:32 oh, and this is a tablet btw.
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:09:35 ^_^
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:09:55 yeah it's 8gb. I don't need more tbh ;/
creations-chat 2019-04-29 18:36:52 there's no need to be so agressive about it
general 2019-04-29 18:41:37 i'm bored what should I do?
general 2019-04-29 18:42:39 it's 7:42PM
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 18:43:45 someone gimme a plane crazy challenge
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:44:36 lmao
general 2019-04-29 20:24:13 why do i feel a sudden urge to build a transport ship that's a hybrid of a SSTO and VTOL
general 2019-04-29 20:24:28 aaa here we go
general 2019-04-29 20:28:25 i'll build a mothership with deployable re-usable drones that can mine ore and produce fuel for the mothership!!
general 2019-04-29 20:28:30 FIGHT MEEEEEE
general 2019-04-29 20:28:59 well, that is
general 2019-04-29 20:29:01 when I finish updating
creations-chat 2019-04-29 20:29:30 oh dear
general 2019-04-29 20:30:30 it took me 30 minutes to kill valentina
general 2019-04-29 20:30:31 are you ok
general 2019-04-29 20:30:36 she's immortal af
general 2019-04-29 20:30:45 my friend tried to
general 2019-04-29 20:30:49 and failed
general 2019-04-29 20:30:52 miserably
general 2019-04-29 20:31:46 in my experience she's survived multiple falls FROM ORBIT
general 2019-04-29 20:32:00 yes
general 2019-04-29 20:32:05 probably
general 2019-04-29 20:32:44 minmus has dead gravity, unless you need to stop en route on the moon - no, it's enough
creations-chat 2019-04-29 20:33:27 ok that's actually pretty damn decent
general 2019-04-29 20:34:15 imagine jumping over a hill using a rover on minmus
general 2019-04-29 20:34:43 it literally goes halfway round the planet before coming back down
general 2019-04-29 20:34:46 #fuelefficiency
general 2019-04-29 20:34:59 oh god
general 2019-04-29 20:36:33 nah
general 2019-04-29 20:36:36 aerobraking
general 2019-04-29 20:36:43 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
help 2019-04-30 17:45:17 I haven't seen any negatives to enabling the option so far to be honest
help 2019-04-30 17:47:48 don't take that for fact though, because I doubt it'd be an option if it didn't have any negatives. you're probably fine to enable it though
general 2019-04-30 18:39:37 oy ya'll
general 2019-04-30 18:39:43 what's a good aerobraking altitude?
general 2019-04-30 18:47:01 here we go
general 2019-04-30 18:47:01 oh god
general 2019-04-30 18:47:30 2.5km/s re-enrty? -_-
general 2019-04-30 18:47:58 mun flyby
general 2019-04-30 18:48:16 my heat shield is about to explode
general 2019-04-30 18:48:33 aaaand fuck
general 2019-04-30 18:50:09 reloaded a quicksave, doing a few aerobrakes at 50k
general 2019-04-30 18:50:15 then i'll fire the engines and pray
general 2019-04-30 18:50:46 it seems to not have exploded yet, so should be ok
general 2019-04-30 18:52:26 you mean eloo? ^_^
general 2019-04-30 18:52:42 how do you spell it
general 2019-04-30 18:52:44 Eeloo
general 2019-04-30 18:56:21 ah
general 2019-04-30 18:56:36 ya been to duna?
general 2019-04-30 18:56:46 it's a good place to start interplanetary flights
general 2019-04-30 18:57:30 OH SHIT
general 2019-04-30 18:57:35 i just ran out of electric charge
general 2019-04-30 19:25:53 finished the final aerobraking
general 2019-04-30 19:25:56 here we fucking go
general 2019-04-30 19:26:16 1.7km/s
general 2019-04-30 19:28:59 made it c;
general 2019-04-30 19:30:10 OH FRICK
general 2019-04-30 19:31:41 my main problem was that my rocket was early game as it gets ;/ had 500m/s DV left when returning from the moon
general 2019-04-30 19:51:23 trying a mission to land on the mun now. this is basically my first time doing it in career ;/
bug-reports 2019-04-30 20:25:38 what's the kick message?
general 2019-04-30 20:26:35 ksp doesn't have multiplayer 🙃
general 2019-04-30 20:26:43 well, there's a mod for multiplayer i guess
general 2019-04-30 20:26:55 i mean, as far as I know anyways
general 2019-04-30 20:27:10 i haven't played since like 1.3 so idk
general 2019-04-30 20:38:12 alright so
general 2019-04-30 20:38:14 i fucked up
general 2019-04-30 20:38:25 and am now in low mun orbit with 600DV
general 2019-04-30 20:38:39 going at about 550m/s
general 2019-04-30 20:42:35 managed to (sort of) crash land the thing, now jeb is very stranded
general 2019-04-30 20:43:55 i uh...
general 2019-04-30 20:43:59 oh dear
general 2019-04-30 20:44:08 i can't revert flight either 😦
general 2019-04-30 20:56:21 i'm not exactly in a position to launch a rescue mission
general 2019-04-30 21:39:09 +Kipkolm, i just don't have the tech to
general 2019-04-30 21:39:29 like, i don't even have a capsule or container or anything suited for the job
general 2019-04-30 21:39:59 mostly, though, i probably couldn't put something on the moon right now with enough dv for any kind of error in a rescue mission
general 2019-04-30 21:40:31 yeaaaaah
general 2019-04-30 21:41:17 probably going to send a number of probes into sun/moon/minmus orbits for M A X I M I U M   S C I E N C E and use it to get the tech I need to rescue jeb
general 2019-04-30 21:46:31 yeah
general 2019-04-30 22:12:28 that's pretty nice but i have important matters on my hands
general 2019-04-30 22:12:38 for example rescuing jeb
general 2019-04-30 22:13:13 i attempted the landing about 8-12 hours in? probably why it failed so miserably
general 2019-04-30 23:35:42 i know, but I've never done a rescue mission in my life >.<
general 2019-04-30 23:45:48 on the mun
general 2019-04-30 23:46:33 in a crashed ship with a bunch of science modules on it
general 2019-04-30 23:47:22 which i preferably want the data from. will have to transfer it to the rescue craft...
general 2019-05-01 00:00:20 career. rather early in career
general 2019-05-01 19:27:39 the jeb rescue mission is underway
general 2019-05-01 19:44:49 landed about 3km from the crash site, time for jeb to say goodbye to the moon i guess
general 2019-05-01 21:17:04 it was just the way things turned out tbh
general 2019-05-01 21:17:24 plus it requires less dv to move your landing point so i could gradually adjust it as i descended
general 2019-05-01 21:48:34 also why does literally everything i build start spinning out of control within about 2 minutes of launching maximium
general 2019-05-01 21:50:56 tellll meeee ;_;
general 2019-05-01 22:00:27 literally everywhere
help 2019-05-01 22:04:16 no.
help 2019-05-01 22:04:36 only things in the 'wing' sections will produce lift
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 16:39:42 bad 😠
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 16:47:32 i would love glass engines tbh
general 2019-05-02 21:16:03 damn beautiful
general 2019-05-04 12:48:13 no
general 2019-05-04 12:48:15 ksp best
general 2019-05-04 12:48:17 shut!
general 2019-05-04 12:48:20 mortal!!
general 2019-05-04 12:48:26 valentina will have your head!!!!!!
general 2019-05-04 12:48:39 and possibly jeb too
general 2019-05-04 15:20:42 w... what?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:41:21 ya'll are going overboard with the amount of materials - bear in mind that a large choice isn't always the best thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:54:37 😠
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:55:20 i have to say i agree
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:56:47 the rocks are just... pfft
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:56:51 not much point
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:57:01 gonna look ugly on 99% of creations imo
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:57:21 but no one actually makes mountains
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:58:16 rust could look good if used to create ramshackle vehicles and wrecks
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:58:52 i mean, apply rust to your generic creation and it looks weird
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:59:02 but it's good for a lot of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:59:55 that's actually a pretty good idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 15:59:59 i'd say more than a week though
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:00:08 people will be excited to try all the new materials
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:00:19 yeah, something like that maybe
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:00:32 but that way, everyone votes without knowing it ^_^
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:00:47 democracy 2.0
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:01:03 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:01:36 i think rusty metal is going to be used
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:01:51 i very highly doubt that
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:02:03 people build planes in plane crazy, not mansions
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:02:31 very very few though
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:02:40 it's not going to be widely used, though, i don't think
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:02:59 because more != good
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:03:07 not always at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:03:16 it's sometimes better to have a simple pallete
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:03:25 otherwise you're kind of swarmed with choice
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:03:42 i really think you should do a script that counts usage
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:03:50 that way we can know for absolute sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:04:33 in that case we could just let people submit their stuff to <#384025409945337856> and see what people use
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:04:51 and review a few weeks later
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:05:05 i really don't think you should remove rusty metal
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:05:10 there are plenty of uses
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:06:20 alright. but if it's clear that a material is barely being used, will you remove it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:06:32 like, by seeing <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:07:16 everyone wants what they don't have
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:07:21 i don't think that would work
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:08:34 i just don't see a use
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:08:46 not a popular one anyway
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:09:10 sure, maybe one in a hundred people will build a house
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:09:13 but otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:09:47 it would just have those two uses, perhaps one or two more
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:10:23 i just really think that you should release everything and after a week we review <#384025409945337856> to find out which materials are being used the least
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:10:32 and if something is obviously underused
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:10:37 bammmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:14:57 ***why are you removing rusty metal there are so many uses for it >:(***
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:16:01 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:16:54 
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:17:20 i'm off to play some factorio
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:31:09 i'm so bored 😦
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:32:04 maybe i should argue with my friend some more, we were just on the topic of 'is having an obsession with poppadoms racist'
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:32:09 on second thoughts...
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:32:48 never you mind!
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:33:18 well... yes, sort of
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:33:32 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 16:33:35 yes

help 2019-05-04 18:19:29 don't take my word for it though
general 2019-05-04 18:24:25 what
help 2019-05-05 08:33:36 rip
general 2019-05-05 11:40:26 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 11:43:08 :<
help 2019-05-06 08:37:11 use a shit ton of wing panels if you want to go fast.
help 2019-05-06 09:05:30 what???
help 2019-05-06 09:06:07 how the heck do lots of wing panels make you flip
general 2019-05-06 09:28:00 b
help 2019-05-06 10:17:24 if you place wing panels really badly, yes, you will flip, but it's pretty hard to do that...
help 2019-05-06 10:17:52 it's all with the center of lift ;/
help 2019-05-06 10:18:39 in that case
help 2019-05-06 10:18:51 spread the wing panels as far out from the center of mass as possible
help 2019-05-06 10:19:04 makes them more effective at stabilizing but doesn't create more drag
help 2019-05-06 11:03:25 i'm talking about adding more wings? just, more wings?
general 2019-05-06 20:52:41 what is breaking ground
general 2019-05-06 21:17:11 not another fucking dlc
general 2019-05-06 21:19:07 the fact they're making people pay to expand a game that costs £30 is just sort of disgusting me
general 2019-05-06 21:22:28 ksp is a popular game
general 2019-05-06 21:22:55 they've sold 2 million copies (average)
general 2019-05-06 21:23:02 that's a good £60 MILLION
general 2019-05-06 21:23:28 are they really that money hungry to be selling expansions instead of working on the game ;/
general 2019-05-06 21:25:02 the worst end of it is that most of these things you can get via mods
general 2019-05-06 21:25:06 without paying a penny
general 2019-05-06 21:26:34 it just seems to me like a bit of a ripoff, as well...
general 2019-05-06 21:27:06 people will get it only because, well, it's official material
general 2019-05-06 22:13:19 that's true, but is it really necassary to put that sort of price on it
general 2019-05-08 16:07:03 **why do they need a tip jar for a game  that costs £30**
creations-chat 2019-05-08 21:27:24 nice work with the saturn V
creations-chat 2019-05-08 21:27:58 how functional is it? does the lunar module have flying or docking capabilities?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:25:26 magnets can weld
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:25:40 from my experience lately, at least
help 2019-05-10 15:59:01 that's actually pretty nice, especially considering it's an original build. not saying that in a bad way, original builds are good

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:31:08 tbh i've kinda started to lose interest in plane crazy

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:44:44 he doesn't have a reason to, in all fairness
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:45:56 he coded it originally
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:46:09 and there is no way to transfer ownership
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:47:01 mad did say he has created a prototype engine for a factory building game but isn't sure if he should go ahead with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:47:26 mostly because it wouldn't suit roblox's audience

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 21:18:51 While some say two to four cups in a day is normal, there are others that claim the upper limit as 10 cups per day. On an average, three to five cups of tea in a day would be okay to have. Rest it depends on the way your body responds to compounds present in tea.27 Jul 2018

general 2019-05-26 18:25:08 **stop with the fucking dlcs**
general 2019-05-26 18:25:43 on a game that costs £30

general 2019-05-26 18:25:47 stop
general 2019-05-26 18:25:49 please
general 2019-05-26 18:44:33 well, *sorry* if i don't like the fact that they are putting out DLCs on a £30 game instead of working on proper inline updates
general 2019-05-26 18:45:19 i'm not broke, i'll probably end up getting the expansion because clearly there isn't really much else to do about it
general 2019-05-26 21:28:37 +vipEmpire i mean that at this point they're putting way more effort into the DLC's than actual free versions
general 2019-05-27 09:48:49 more career mode, i want to launch a kerbnet probe around minmus and mark out all the different biomes
general 2019-05-27 09:48:53 then send a hopper in

general 2019-05-27 11:49:44 i want to try asteroid mining later on
general 2019-05-27 11:50:32 it could be interesting to have a station in high kerbin orbit for refueling outgoing interplanetary vessels
general 2019-05-27 11:50:58 and then a station in the same orbit of a nearby asteroid
general 2019-05-27 11:51:17 which i would probably redirect into a orbit similar to kerbins
general 2019-05-27 13:13:07 this vessel

general 2019-05-27 13:47:48 in the end just aborted and went back to kerbin with my science ;/
general 2019-05-27 14:14:52 it's not the landscape, it's completely flat
general 2019-05-27 14:21:00 might be the legs though
general 2019-05-27 19:16:33 i landed perfectly upright tho... in fact, i made sure to kill my horizontal velocity several hundred meters up and then just point radial
general 2019-05-27 19:24:43 nope
general 2019-05-27 19:24:57 actually, i did have the same problem at my previous landing site

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:54:57 tbh i'd argue that you can do everything you can do with the jetpack without it(at least, important to the game's structure) so it isn't really pay-to-win (yet)

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:01:25 IT'S NOT IN THE ACTION LOGS
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:01:29 😠
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:02:28 hold up what 👀
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:03:36 i also have
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:04:08 devex is kinda meh unless you make a proper good amount of robux

plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:19:19 uh yeah, there was some drama and that happened but i don't know if i'm even allowed to talk about that ;/
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:20:36 yes, it certainly did, after a few weeks of various attempts to no
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:20:45 😉
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:21:38 😦
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:22:32 i really want to say more but not sure if I can ._.
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:22:44 yeah a bigger map would be hecking great
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:23:02 the problem right now is that regions of terrain can't be merged
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:23:28 so if people make regions it's in vain because there's literally no way to add them onto the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:23:41 unless of course you got a copy of the current terrain region and worked off that
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 15:24:25 but yes, it would be great if someone could make a new map, but it would take a long time and a lot of effort
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 18:18:47 AY aethiest gang
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 18:18:49 bye
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 18:18:49 oh

creations-chat 2019-06-03 19:59:10 the Dystoria, a cargo ship created for high endurance cargo transport through industrialized regions. Patented in 2043 for use in low-risk regions, it is a cheap ship for its size, and has a weak hull, meaning torpedoes and underwater armament are a prevalent threats. All cargo is stored below the waterline, allowing for cold store materials to be easily stowed. The top section features specialized storage facilities and not unreasonably comfortable living quarters. The craft is powered using high efficiency fuel cells, resulting in a very low speed of 5.5kts, but very low refuel cost.

creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:03:55 ...
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:17:31 The industrial flagship 'Steelmouth' is an enormous behemoth even for its time, It sails from port to port, buying, processing and selling resources. The ship features an array of industrial complexes and has crew quarters below decks. The ship was commissioned in 2053 and continues to roam the oceans to this day. The light armament, however, means huge vulnerability to pirates, and slow speed make it extremely susceptible to traditional threaten-and-pillage tactics. This resulted in a small VTOL pad being installed above a storage room, which can hold two small offensive VTOLS capable of taking out threats at a respectable distance. The ship 
 uses a large diesel engine which powers the propellers and supplies power for all industrial processes.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:18:21 The front of the ship has a crane for loading and unloading small packages onto a miniature rail network spanning the ship, and a well armoured control room.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:18:54 Behind the control room sits the refinery, where oil products are slowly cracked over the journey. Most of the ships fuel is made in this way.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:19:55 Towards the centre of the ship sits a light VTOL runway and hastily built control room for VTOL's, above a storage room used for repair tools and ammunition.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:21:07 The engine utilizes a fuel line running through the VTOL pad for refuelling, and uses a high-efficiency diesel engine. A lot of output goes toward generating power, as the electrical needs of such a ship are very high.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:22:07 At the rear is an industrial complex featuring a blast furnace and casting channels, and a small assembly unit.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:24:16 The blast furnace is a very skilful piece of engineering, running at over a thousand degrees. Concerns about the wooden deck were voiced, and the room now has a floor of metal. The blast furnace is a very prominent feature of the ship, and uses lighter fuel products to blast oxygen into the furnace.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:25:13 Right at the back is a modular casting room used for custom orders and precise casting.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:25:23 oh jesus
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:25:26 the bot broke again

creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:27:45 very curious to see what people think of this one
general 2019-06-06 22:29:01 this is why we spam parachutes
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:42:05 I should probably do that
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:45:25 it's actually fairly easy. An engine in the center, wings surrounding it and propellers for turning surrounding the wings is the smallest design I know
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:45:33 5x5
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:45:49 I will want weaponry on them too, though
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:46:31 I would send you one but not on my PC right now
creations-chat 2019-06-07 15:07:43 AY, my ship got 12 upvotes in total
creations-chat 2019-06-07 15:07:50 didn't expect that good reception
bug-reports 2019-06-07 15:08:21 needs more wings
bug-reports 2019-06-07 15:08:38 the shaking is because the wings keep trying to stabilise but just end up making the effect worse
bug-reports 2019-06-07 15:08:50 more wings = greater effect = yes
general 2019-06-07 15:09:01 **why though**
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 15:26:30 n0
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:39:04 why don't you just suggest it yourself?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:39:16 oh
general 2019-06-07 19:40:36 the content is extremely cool, the fact they make you pay even more than the £30 you already spent on this game is just...
general 2019-06-07 19:48:10 yeah it just bugs me they work on DLCs over actual inline content
general 2019-06-07 20:56:01 last time I played ksp i tried to do a 200k double rescue mission to duna. one guy stranded in high orbit, one guy on the surface
general 2019-06-07 20:56:29 was pretty confident i could do it, had done a similar mission to minmus before with a lot less dv
general 2019-06-07 20:56:42 but that was before i accidentally entered orbit in the wrong direction
general 2019-06-07 20:57:04 yeah, that kind of screwed it up for me
general 2019-06-07 20:57:10 not 100% sure what do do now
general 2019-06-07 21:14:19 here's my duna craft

help 2019-06-09 19:12:32 if impact is enabled, if it hits above that speed it will explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 20:18:09 the tradelands server literally has 80 boosts already
general 2019-06-09 21:36:48 hey that's hecking neat
general 2019-06-09 21:36:57 i used to play on DMP but it was fairly buggy sometimes
general 2019-06-09 21:37:11 i think it was just sandbox too
general 2019-06-10 19:40:31 spaceplanes usually have a lot of DV but use more to get into orbit in my experience
general 2019-06-10 19:40:39 though i don't usually make spaceplanes
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:43:56 1) Front wings definitely don't look like they belong there, I would suggest just moving the rear wings forward
2) You might want to try and build a bit smoother. It is possible to build detailed and smooth at the same time, as I've found out recently, and they generally look better
3) Engines look a bit odd like that, with the mount offset. I suggest building custom engines using half blocks and then putting the real engines in the interior

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:12:15 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:12:27 but ssd + 8gb of ram don't go that well, I will say
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:25:13 l0l
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:25:26 just respond here
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:25:41 me too in fact
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:25:47 mostly TC3 and tradelands though
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:25:58 and it stopped on TC3 when i updated my drivers
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:26:04 but getting real bad performance now
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:26:24 i literally get no more than 15fps at MINIMIUM graphics on tradelands
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:26:27 used to be 30-40
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:26:42 yeah try updating dem drivers
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:27:44 i3 intel 😭
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:28:54 talking of tradelands, someone really needs to make an air-based game with *some* sort of currency
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:29:04 we're getting tired of all the sandbox flight simulators aright
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:29:20 yeah that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:29:25 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:30:23 buy blocks, transport cargo(more cargo = more money), complete certain missions(not unlike contracts in ksp), idk
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:30:47 i have an alt somewhere in here but i forgot what it's called
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:31:08 yeah that's exactly what i was thinking
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:31:27 ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:31:28 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:32:40 tbh it wouldn't really work on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:32:42 like, at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:32:55 it works in games like ftd because they were designed for balance from the ground up
general 2019-06-10 20:33:42 why aren't you using nuclear engines?
general 2019-06-10 20:33:43 😠
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:34:04 i'm about halfway to level 10 from 9
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:34:07 on tradelands
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:34:11 i want that sweet atlas
general 2019-06-10 20:34:30 your real man rapier is inefficient, ancient and overall bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:34:40 **how do you even**
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:34:44 ***...***
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 20:35:13 i was playing nova w/ a friend recently but kept crashing
general 2019-06-10 20:35:22 what the shit
general 2019-06-10 20:35:29 they are EXTREMELY efficient
general 2019-06-10 20:35:34 and burn only liquid fuel
general 2019-06-10 20:36:02 ISP of 800 in a vacuum
general 2019-06-10 20:36:49 tbh they're pretty overpowered
general 2019-06-10 20:37:04 used in practically all interplanetary craft mid-later game
general 2019-06-10 20:37:16 they have terrible isp in atmosphere though
general 2019-06-10 20:37:22 so good for apollo style missions
general 2019-06-10 20:37:28 and probes and stuff
general 2019-06-10 20:51:26 you're not using just nuclear engines, are you?
general 2019-06-10 20:58:21 BAD
general 2019-06-10 20:58:59 the idea is to have enough traditional jets to get you to a decent speed and altitude, then burn nuclear once you reach flameout
general 2019-06-10 20:59:22 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC7h4NYdVTY
general 2019-06-10 20:59:26 this is a good example
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:18:08 i learned english when i was in england
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:24:48 👏
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:50:45 what kind of pisses me off about that is that there aren't even double the upvotes over downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:51:07 i mean, it's just, a lot of people seem to think it a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:51:51 and then I suggested hiring a terrain builder and it got 22 more upvotes, no downvotes and he STILL won't get a new map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:52:43 i remember him telling me he 'kinda likes this one' or fairly sure
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:52:53 well, the thing with whitelisting though
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:52:56 it is hard as shit to do
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:53:08 because the code is just really hard to work with
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:53:19 it couldn't really be solved just by hiring a scripter
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:53:28 and yes, absolutely agree
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:54:48 look. it's not just 'add it and if people don't like it, they won't play it.' it just doesn't really work that simply
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:55:10 it could really end up damaging the game more than helping it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:55:20 you don't even know what it would be
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:55:43 honestly, I would be in support but there are just WAY too many factors here
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:55:51 what kayn said
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:56:27 people would pretty much always just find an 'easiest way to do it' for each task or job
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:57:32 yes, but guess what!
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:57:38 rick 'likes this map'
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:57:41 so we won't get a new one
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:57:42 nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:57:57 i'm sorry for being so toxic, but I feel strongly about this
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:58:45 yes, absolutely, the map is just...
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:58:52 it doesn't match the game's content anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:59:14 sure, when it took a full minute at most to cross the map, that was good
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:59:19 but now it's just ;/
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 14:59:51 yeah, i did suggest a colour change but rick didn't want to
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:00:01 even made a pallet to show him
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:00:43 he did?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:00:49 why don't we have that map then
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:00:55 has he sent it to rick?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:01:59 i was literally playing with him from the beginning of the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:02:03 but he won't listen
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:02:10 so i don't think you'd get much chance
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:02:32 that's hecking good
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:02:52 ok that's really nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:03:18 has he sent the file to rickje?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:03:21 or has anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:03:31 or even asked him about it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:03:55 ima message dev evan to try and get the file
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:04:01 see if I can get it to rickje
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:04:26 uh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:04:34 that would not work
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:05:01 huh? why not
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:05:59 is dev_evan devtesla?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:06:54 has it at least got an ocean?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:07:20 i'm just going to message him and ask for some screenshots and see if we can vote
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:07:48 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:00 the dev_evan one?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:10 oh. so you've got the save file?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:32 i mean, can you export it using crazyman's terrain plugin?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:53 so rickje can actually implement it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:03 eventually anyways
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:29 how close are you to finishing it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:10:20 but how close are you to finishing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:11:15 blackbird, once you feel you've finished or are very close to finished, DM me some screenshots and I'll upload them in <#490306593242611742> for voting
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:11:30 then we can see if rickje does that stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:11:45 yes. i meant you plural
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:12:03 does evan work on it nowdays, anyways?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:12:31 is evan working on it though?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:13:17 have either of you even been working on it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:14:59 woah
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:04 that's pretty hecking good
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:46 train tracks aren't terrain, plus we don't know how large they are
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:54 so tbh might be better to leave traintracks to rick
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:20:56 YEEHAW
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:07 it really isn't
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:23 mountains are pretty nice imo
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:36 it would be nice to have a path running through them
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:40:42 what's the competition about?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:41:06 why
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:43:06 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:43:06 honestly, maybe i would compete but i'd probably just end up getting angry at the amount of replications and leaving
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:44:16 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:53:43 HOLD UP
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:53:52 do we build the creations there?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:53:54 or existing ones?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:54:18 I'M COMIN
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:56:46 meh, whatever

the-dump 2019-06-14 15:16:38 this is a roblox discord. it's a discord, but it's still a roblox discord. that's why we don't allow that sorta stuff
the-dump 2019-06-14 15:18:08 I know, but there's still a limit to how offensive we want things
the-dump 2019-06-14 15:18:23 particularly since so many of our users barely do clear 13
the-dump 2019-06-14 15:20:05 modern problems stopped requiring modern solutions long ago
help 2019-06-16 16:18:14 there have been some various changes to weight, could be affecting it depending on how long ago you built it. I would just add more wings at the front or use ballasts at the back

help 2019-06-19 18:08:12 well, you see
help 2019-06-19 18:08:21 the problem, as usual, is roblox physics being terrible
help 2019-06-19 18:08:53 tbh I'm not particularly familiar with hydrofoils, but it looks like you'd need the water ingame to actually, well, work like water
help 2019-06-19 18:18:02 wings don't really work much different in water
help 2019-06-19 18:18:12 when their code was written, water wasn't taken into account
help 2019-06-19 18:18:32 craft just go a lot slower in water
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 18:29:27 dude
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 18:29:32 do !servers again
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 18:29:33 ;P
help 2019-06-19 18:30:36 well... to put it in short: if you do make a hydrofoil, it's not going to work on real-life concepts
bug-reports 2019-06-19 19:40:47 there are some ways to minimize the lag, mostly through trial and error
bug-reports 2019-06-19 19:40:55 no easy fix for this tho, at least I would think
general 2019-06-19 22:12:20 **not necessarily**
general 2019-06-19 22:12:35 0
help 2019-06-20 06:52:22 Just ask what you need ;p
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 15:28:35 i mean, sure, galaxy'd be cool for some people, but most people would be trying to figure out what a wasp is for while 2 or 3 people fight each other
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 15:30:07 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 15:30:31 but that's playing a *good* space game

plane-crazy 2019-06-21 15:12:43 tfw you scroll through the 'saturn v' search results to look at the stuff people have built and find people who tried to tell moderators that the one I made was theirs
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 15:13:23 i'll take a challenge >:)
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 15:13:49 what

plane-crazy 2019-06-22 19:08:25 <@163143541160148992> yes, but I mean that people are going to crash into it a couple times then never touch it again ;/ time would be much better spent on quality of life/new parts/stuff like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 19:10:01 well you wouldn't think it from the progress that's been going on
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 19:11:02 oh riiiight, the disaster survival gamemode

help 2019-06-22 19:42:31 there's no way that thing is causing lag, lol
help 2019-06-22 19:42:52 and if anyone doesn't like it they can just blacklist you, so we wouldn't do anything anyway

plane-crazy 2019-06-23 09:04:13 oh, the.. ah

creations-chat 2019-06-23 11:39:54 ayy
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:44:05 playing ftd makes me die
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:44:12 because i'm terrible at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:44:31 i literally have 200 hours and haven't beat dwg
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:44:32 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:45:39 tbh i spent most of the 200 hours trying to figure out why my AI kept turning my plane in loop-de-loops
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:46:15 nah they all flew like a charm manually..
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:46:43 the new breadboards look interesting
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:47:09 i hate what they did to the missiles though... ;/
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:47:12 good question
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:47:21 disaster survival I think, or something equally boring
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:47:44 beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:48:14 it's actually the wings being at the back
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:48:17 **checkmate**
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:48:42 it gets pushed down above water, then it's pushed up again
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:49:11 just build something from your imagination
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:51:44 i got very big boy rocket... 4k parts, finished yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:51:45 fun
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:56:48 you're still on the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:56:58 yeah this kept happening to me too
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:57:03 on tradelands and TC3 only though
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:57:11 had a couple of crashes on plane crazy but nothing regular
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:57:31 apparently the problem is not that it, well, crashes, but it just stops rendering your screen...
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:57:35 no idea why
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 11:59:51 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 12:02:39 because replication bad

plane-crazy 2019-06-23 15:51:12 the hec
help 2019-06-23 18:20:45 that's where you're wrong buddy
general 2019-06-23 19:43:27 whenever I build anything I just slap a bunch of fuel tanks and things together and generally try and make sure it has 6000+ dV
general 2019-06-23 19:44:01 works *most* of the time
general 2019-06-23 19:44:15 except when i enter orbit the wrong way(keeps happening)
general 2019-06-23 19:45:47 i mean orbit around my destination
help 2019-06-24 16:26:22 Tbh all you need to do to deal with these people is blacklist them, unless they're causing lag
help 2019-06-24 16:27:38 pl0b
help 2019-06-24 16:34:48 I mean, what's the problem if he's not lagging? all you need to do is blacklist him, it's not really worth giving them attention
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:07:21 i was the one to start that wiki, then i kinda forgot about it and came back to find out he'd requested owner transfer and got it... i just left him to his stuff lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:08:33 no game 'needs' a wiki in that sense... i mean, not to find out about blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:08:50 but it's good to be able to show mechanisms and building strategies. not that it's used for that
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:19 yes, ik, but it's still good to be able to see uses and strategies
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:30 there's no point in a wiki for the blocks tbh
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:42 but for mechanisms and stuff, I suppose... at least to give inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:50 i suppose, yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:11:30 i think most of us here did, but we've been playing for ages lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:12:42 if the wiki was actually used to showcase builds and mechanisms, i think it would be worth it
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:20:38 hold up
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:20:40 what mods?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:05 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:08 naw
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:26 i like nuclear reactors and big control rooms
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:34 and thermal expansion
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:44 and digital storage
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:56 ew ic2
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:21:58 bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:22:46 i do play factorio
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:22:51 but it just is not the same
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:22:53 at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:23:01 have you ever used RFTools?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:23:31 the best mod in existance
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:23:47 custom screens, dimension editors, matter system, teleporters, all that stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:24:08 well factorio if you don't mind playing 24/7
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:24:15 because it's mildly addicting
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:24:52 tbh factorio is good if you like logistics, automation and planning
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:25:09 minecraft is a bit more diverse because the wider range of mods
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:25:21 but all the same
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:39:17 hold up now
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:39:24 aegis is shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:39:42 used to be fucking great
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:39:49 you went around as a terrorist blowing up bases
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:40:37 now it's just a shitty round based game with some sort of attempt at forced co-operative base building (does not work)
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:41:01 you have to drive for 20 minutes to get anywhere, but the thing is you do that repetitively
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:41:18 you go the same fucking route about 50 times just spamming vehicles against their base
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:41:26 because there is absolutely no reason to expand out
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:41:31 no incentive at all
help 2019-06-24 17:41:53 send screenshots, this sounds kinda ridiculous
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:42:21 i used to play the alpha ALL THE TIME, no idea why widgeon decided to close it
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:42:34 yeah. the open world aspect was just brilliant
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:42:40 absolutely fantastic combination
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:42:44 well executed
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:42:48 unlike this fucking mess
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:43:15 and don't get me started about galaxy lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:43:43 it used to be fairly alright, the community wasn't even bad and grinding was minimal compared to now
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:43:59 then they added the loyalty thing and fucked with the economy
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:44:46 result: riots in their discord. i'm talking proper riots. people spam pinging, channels being overflowed, screaming and swearing in the voice channels, nsfw everywhere you looked
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:44:52 server was put on lockdown for 6 hours
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:45:15 and yet they didn't do a fucking thing about it. fairly sure at least half their playerbase quit after that
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:45:25 galaxy was basically ruled by a dictator anyways
help 2019-06-24 17:56:18 are the motors powered by any chance?
help 2019-06-24 17:56:58 well that's the reason then
help 2019-06-24 17:57:10 you need TONS of force to move a powered motor
help 2019-06-24 17:57:43 what?
help 2019-06-24 18:00:05 well, they're super slow *because* they're powered... so you'll have to find a way to do it with unpowered motors, basically
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:29:35 here it comes boys
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:29:46 it's time to make a sacrifice
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:37:30 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:37:41 prepare for the sacrifice
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:37:56 our target is rickje
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:38:15 therefore I have put a bunch of anchored motors(so they are 'fixed' motors)
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:38:31 bait is set
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:38:33 now we wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:39:24 tbh i haven't even finished the ritual yet
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:57:21 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:57:25 
help 2019-06-24 20:05:11 no, motors are just broken as heck
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:53:23 because roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:53:36 plane crazy uses roblox's data store service
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:53:47 so you can only store a limited amount of data for each player
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:53:48 hm?

plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:26:00 outlines = yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:28:37 YES IT IS
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:28:43 IT IS.

plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:50:57 it's not a problem with my PC, at least not in terms of performance, because everything else runs absolutely fine, same as it's always done
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:51:01 3 years
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:52:14 i'll probably try that then ;/
doubt it will help though
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:52:28 not getting any worse performance in other games, or other *anything* for that
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:52:29 lol

general 2019-07-03 20:54:43 atmosphere's much hotter at the top
general 2019-07-03 20:55:17 gets hot again toward the bottom but by then you're going so slowly it doesn't matter

the-dump 2019-07-03 21:14:51 ya'll think you're so good on your high perches

the-dump 2019-07-03 21:14:57 i put air in the corners
the-dump 2019-07-03 21:15:09 don't feel so fucking great now, do you?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:15:45 yeaaaah on that note
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:15:51 rick apparently looked at the outline thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:15:54 and he can't disable it
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:10 apparently roblox doesn't let him
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:21 but yah he said he posted something on the dev forum
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:28 god knows if roblox will do anything
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:36 not so simple
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:47 you'd need to create parts for all the boundaries of the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:16:58 already looking at hours of work ;/
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:17:42 outlines should be an option, roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:17:45 🤦
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:17:56 r6 > everything
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:18:09 me neither ^
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:18:22 actually i played today but basically ragequit
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:19:21 because my fps was around 5, it had taken several minutes to get my rocket up, roblox crashed, lots of motor glitches, outlines were pissing me off already, and then the rocket flung
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:19:45 it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:19:53 **it really is.**
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:20:07 alright fine, maybe you find it easy to
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:20:08 but i don't
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:22:04 no outlines look pretty good outside of build mode as long as your thing is coloured
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:22:18 yeah well, we wanted to make an option for outlines
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:22:27 but apparently roblox won't let rick do that
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:23:53 yeah, stuff looks good without outlines, generally speaking
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:23:57 unless you're in build mode
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:24:50 **fuck**
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:24:59 alright, guess i'm not gonna be on plane crazy for a while
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:25:02 nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:26:04 what? i mostly enjoy building, i often build interiors and large structure. it is fucking HORRIBLE to build those without outlines
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:26:06 at least for me
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:26:24 it just takes away the enjoyment for me to have to squint all the time to see where to place a block
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:26:36 not saying i don't enjoy it, i just have things i'd rather play
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:26:39 that's all
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:27:04 ^
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:27:34 to paint interior with no outlines you'd probably need to just splash random colour everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:27:35 just saying
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:28:01 if you can't see where to paint, how do you actually paint?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:28:14 it's hard to tell WHERE the blocks are
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:28:19 you just see a screen of white lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:28:41 they are invisible in a practical way
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:28:46 ^
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:29:51 not everyone is the same as you.
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:30:07 i think about 3/4 of my saved creations rn have interior
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:30:17 si
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:30:36 so basically the same thing as it is now
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:31:06 just turn your graphics settings down
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:31:10 that removes shadows i believe
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:32:20 hold up, idea:
when we place a block, there's always an outline around what we're placing. what if rick copied that code and implemented it for all the other blocks, maybe changing the outline a bit, then adding a button to toggle this view?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:32:25 don't know if it would be possible
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:33:18 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:33:27 what? why?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:33:48 that's exactly what i was suggesting
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:34:59 but you still at least see there's a block there. it's decisively an improvement
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:35:05 it's a *compromise*
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:35:12 if we can't get outlines back
general 2019-07-03 21:36:53 do all the training, maybe not the last mission, then i would look at the scenarios
general 2019-07-03 21:37:10 one or two of them that seem interesting, anyways
general 2019-07-03 21:39:47 ..
general 2019-07-03 21:40:12 yeah, take your time tho
general 2019-07-03 21:40:29 there a lot to learn if you don't know orbital mechanics
general 2019-07-03 21:40:43 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRXgFu3RpYk
general 2019-07-03 21:40:46 a lot actually
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:41:20 you know how there's an outline when we place blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:41:24 apply that here
general 2019-07-03 21:41:31 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>

bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:11 spinning?
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:46:26 Undoubtedly a asymmetry problem, I've had them before... we've had stuff like this reported but in the end people always found the cause
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:46:57 i think i know the problem
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:47:01 send a screenshot
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:47:03 of the whole plot
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:47:55 they can't be changed by scripts or smth
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:49:03 *really*, **really,** ***really*** need to
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:49:35 so you mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:49:41 the property can't be changed via scripts?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:49:51 it can only be set once in studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:49:58 then not changed once roblox has launched?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:50:21 because <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:50:28 sadly
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:50:38 me neither
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:51:13 i say that if we really **have** to, wait a week or two, do another vote, see what people think now. opinions will probably change
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:51:34 me too ;/
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:51:48 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:52:23 because they've only been playing w/o  outlines for like
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:52:26 less than 24 hours
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:53:02 they haven't had chance to actually experience the frustration of building, especially lar-

bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:55:30 check F9
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:55:34 any red lines?
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:55:43 press f9 and screenshot any red lines you see
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:55:45 oh
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:55:55 nevermind
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:56:38 i can't see your COM and COL, wouldn't really help to join you
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:56:55 try deleting all the visible parts
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:57:04 and look where the mass indicator ends up
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:57:08 ...
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:57:44 that's actually really weird, never heard the before. it's possible you somehow managed to get a block under your plot by accident or something like that
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:57:56 can't really help much then, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 21:59:30 i'm off for tonight. behave.
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 22:01:14 if sleep is for the weak, strong people must be awfully... weak in the daytime. and night time. so does this mean strong people are actually weak, so everyone is technically weak?

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:08:41 obviously
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:09:24 oh GOD, now flip only works in the main pilot seat

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:29:47 aright i'm off to photoshop
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:31:13 i've had autosave off for about 4 months
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:31:24 you're not alone buddy -holds out hand-
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:31:57 i just decided to disable it when my 4k part saturn v kept saving to the autosave slot
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:33:17 if you do small scale projects, autosave = yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:33:33 if you're building your humble 6k flying box or smth
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:33:38 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:33:39 kthx
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 16:33:47 he did?
help 2019-07-07 18:03:24 if it's causing problems, use ballasts to one side of your ship... it's likely because you have something or other offset on top
help 2019-07-07 18:08:16 i highly doubt that it's actually going to cause any problems. if i were you I would just leave it - if it's a folding ship it's going to be off centre no matter what
help 2019-07-07 18:13:08 oh.
help 2019-07-07 18:13:26 the center of mass being offset is not the problem
help 2019-07-07 18:14:21 the problem is that it's too high. if the center of mass is above the waterline, the ship is liable to tipping over. I would replace the beams at the bottom of the ship with ballasts set as high as possible
help 2019-07-07 18:14:44 but keep in mind that the ballast setting does NOT reflect on the position of the yellow ball
help 2019-07-07 18:14:59 it does change the center of mass, but it is not shown by the yellow ball
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:55:48 god damnit
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:56:20 This is Orion Arbitar IV.

The multi-stage rocket is capable of interplanetary flights to every planet in our solar system. Advances in fuel and engine technology have made it possible to lift such a heavy payload with such a comparatively small rocket, allowing for efficient vacuum based engines to provide most overall thrust.

The launchpad has a suspended circular base to evenly distribute the rockets weight and allow for maintenance to take place. The launch tower has few facilities, acting mostly as a support arm to steady the rocket. Fuelling and loading is mostly done by drones.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:56:46 The four massive first stage engines are incredibly efficient, burning pressurized high-grade fuel. Black stripes mixed with dark red line the first stage - despite technology nullifying the need for them, it was decided to uphold tradition.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:00 Once the first stage's fuel has been depleted, the fairing around the second stage engine is deployed and the engine activated. The second stage uses a fairly nondescript vacuum suited engine, which is used to complete orbit circulisation and burns a even higher grade liquid fuel.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:20 Fairing is deployed as soon as the craft is in orbit. The fairing is composed of 30 pieces, each separated and immediately pulled away from the craft by low thrust solid boosters. Each piece de-orbits after a period of weeks, while the main payload continues its journey.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:42 The mothership uses highly efficient nuclear engines, burning low density specialized fuel stored in high-pressure containers inside the ship. Once a transfer burn has successfully been executed, the crew will go into the cryogenic bay at the tip of the mothership, where they will remain in sleep until their destination is reached.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:46 lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:46 halfway point
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:12 Typically, the crew will wake just hours before descent is imminent - the craft will be controlled by an on-board computer in their absence. The standard procedure is to set the entire craft on a collision course with the target planetary body, release the lander and burn engines to re-enter orbit. The lander then fires its rockets to slow down before a gentle touchdown. All of this is controlled by the mothership's computer.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:38 After everything is cleared up on the surface, the ascent module is separated from the landing module to return to the mothership. In this case the module is an atmospheric variant, switching to small inline rocket boosters once the main engines have flamed out. Usually, ascent is timed to allow for an optimal rendezvous window.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:57 When the two craft are close enough and relative speed has been nullified, docking can begin. The two craft are configured to always be pointing at each other, and when they get close enough docking magnets will be activated to ensure accurate docking.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:59:17 The crew are then placed into cryogenic sleep again for the return journey. More often than not the planets will be in a sub-optimal position for a return transfer, so the mothership tends to come back with depleted fuel tanks. Usually several high altitude aerobraking maneuvers will be done before re-entry to slow the craft to acceptable speeds. The mothership calculates a re-entry course, aligns the orbit appropriately and sends the capsule on its way.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:59:39 The capsule can withstand both ground and water landings, using two parachutes set into the sides. As soon as the capsule has touched down, the door will be jettisoned and a recovery team can come to search for the capsule.

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 19:02:07 until i realised
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 19:02:12 that ropes are non collisable?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 19:02:20 it was a minor complication
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 19:02:32 yah, you'd have to use motors n stuff

help 2019-07-09 16:33:28 i kinda wanted to build an orbital bomber to use again ships
help 2019-07-09 16:33:45 but then i considered the fact that they'd just spawn in tiny planes and come and chase me
help 2019-07-09 17:31:18 my orbital bomber idea was to create something that would just fly straight up and then anchor once it was high enough, then drop guided bombs with control surfaces bound to WASD
help 2019-07-09 17:31:34 and put fins on the back of the bombs to make them point downward
help 2019-07-09 17:34:36 i did start working on one but it was frankly too massive to fly properly
help 2019-07-09 17:35:42 thruster sticks. fucking thruster sticks
general 2019-07-09 17:43:17

general 2019-07-10 19:09:03 this was in front of 100+ people
general 2019-07-10 19:09:17 apparently you couldn't hear a thing from my guitar
general 2019-07-10 19:09:25 **fuck that tech guy**
general 2019-07-10 19:09:48 you couldn't tell the mike was off either from where I was
general 2019-07-10 19:10:13 i know right. i had practiced so much for that bloody performance

creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:19:00 meh... I just wish we'd get more original builds
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:22:07 it takes more effort to build good original creations than good replications
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:22:12 so people just build replications
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:22:30 but yah. fighters and commercial airliners have been built to death

plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:27:43 whenever I try to do any folder organization i just end up saving my pictures to wherever suits me at the time
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:28:13 this is still in my plane crazy creations folder for instance
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:29:37 depends on your standards
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:30:42 tbh i stopped upvoting replications a long time ago, unless they were really good
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:30:51 just because... it doesn't appeal to me
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:31:54 i just... you have this game with tons of different blocks and mechanics and mechanisms
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:32:11 and people just flat out try and copy things from other places
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:10 yah. at this point i've taken to only posting one build a month or so, but making it a very high quality build
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:44 search up 'orion arbitar' in <#384025409945337856> for instance.
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:55 i try to build most of my stuff like that
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:34:33 we had our school's annual concert today
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:34:36 on that note
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:35:07 i had a lead guitar part i'd been practicing for mroe than half a fucking year and guess what, the technician forgot to turn the bloody microphone on
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:35:46 it was actually a nice performance too
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:18 interiors are fun to build sometimes
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:41 you know what really pissed me off though

creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:46:37 for instance, the top picture is a blast furnace, behind it is, not visible in the picture, some stuff related to casting
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:46:44 built that as part of the interior
general 2019-07-11 11:58:49 can someone please explain to me why every single fucking plane I make tips backward after launch despite having multiple SAS modules, good engines, lots of wings and fucking perfect COM/COL alignment?

general 2019-07-15 19:04:03 never heard of aerodynamics calculations though
general 2019-07-15 19:05:39 yep, i did check all of that stuff
general 2019-07-15 19:26:08 ok yeah, finally built something half decent
general 2019-07-15 19:29:36 tbh the only reason I wanted a ssto was because I needed to rescue four kerbals from a 'station' I'd built for a contract
general 2019-07-15 19:52:32 what's the most efficient angle to fly spaceplanes at?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:21:37 👏

plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:24:06 ;c
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:24:52 done that, wasn't particularly fun
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:25:29 i was building an orbital bomber but got burned out because it was hard to add in detail to my chosen design
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:25:41 that's actually not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:26:04 i was thinking of using the mobile base from that space engineers series as inspiration... lemme find it
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:28:50 wdym by transformer?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:29:08 i can't find any good screenshots, but this sort of thing

general 2019-07-16 17:36:28 time to go deprive some kerbals of oxygen
help 2019-07-16 17:36:58 i would say to put the fold in between the two, then build around it
help 2019-07-16 17:37:03 looks better from the top and bottom

plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:39:45 i'll leave someone else to answer that question
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:39:48 an expert, perhaps
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:40:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:40:51 idk if school's keeping him off discord or anything
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:40:56 he's just inactive as of late

plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:02:15 i mean, i don't see the harm in telling these noobs why
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:04:02 tbh I think vip's demotion was unjust but i can't really argue against voxel ;/
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:06:45 voxel is strict on his rules in his own ways.

plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:05:43 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:05:49 plane crazy in general is falling apart
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:06:30 i honestly wish we could just revert to like 2017-18 when there were like 10 people playing
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:06:46 because now the game is just fucking shit, mostly because of the community
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:08:28 you just log on to a public server and you will find either
A) people arguing
B) dead chat, no one seems able to type
C) childish and immature people everywhere
D) people who skipped the tutorial and are raging about it being a bad game
E) people who don't understand how aerodynamics work
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:08:38 usually a combination
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:03 AAAAA
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:07 OUR SAVIOUR
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:10 HAS ARRIVED
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:17 I BOW DOWN TO YOU
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:26 
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:36 THE MOTOR GREETS YOU
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:09:54 MOTOR
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:10:36 just after it came out of development. there was fuel, just jets and propellers, suspension, wings and... motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:10:42 when mad played every day
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:10:49 and actually interacted with everyone there
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:10:52 yes c;
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:02 there was fuel once
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:05 like
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:09 right at the beginning
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:27 yeah, the community was the best i'd ever found on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:33 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:41 there was no toxicity
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:11:49 absolutely
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:12:05 nah most of plane crazy is toxic
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:12:31 well yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:12:37 but popularity brings uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:12:40 a shitstorm
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:12:58 like have you noticed the massive drop in like dislike ratio lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:13:08 people just don't understand it
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:13:16 imo there shouldn't be a tutorial, idiot proofing
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:13:24 actually wait
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:13:45 if you can pass the tutorial, which like 90% of roblox can't, you're officially not a roblox idiot
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:13:54 
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:14:06 no 3 quarters
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:14:53 right at the beginning basically only madattak knew how to build a working plane lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:15:06 everyone else was just confused as heck trying to figure out how it worked
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:17:10 RICKJE
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:17:28 but rickje

plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:18:54 
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:18:55 this is basically why
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:19:04 some guy messages me asking me if i was developer
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:19:13 so i posted in mod chat and everyone started dming him lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:19:36 
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:19:43 
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:22:30 wait is rick still here
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:30:11 hold on what happened to imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:30:45 i'm going to treat it as hiatus for now
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:31:01 because i have gone away for a long time at once and then come back
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:31:09 perhaps the same is the case here

plane-crazy 2019-08-07 22:31:25 well, hiatus

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 01:33:47 well, we've set up most things

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 01:34:01 channels, bots, roles, ranking

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 03:47:40 the community is still shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 03:47:46 if you were wondering
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:33:27 ..

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:35:55 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:35:58 what's going on now?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:43:24 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:44:01 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:44:11 could we please not?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:45:25 i have no evidence for either side of this argument. i'm not going to warn anyone because i have absolutely no way to tell what really happened
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:45:45 revoked
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:45:46 thank you
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:48:35 both of you, stop. this is not going to go anywhere, and I am completely unable to take action because I have **no solid evidence.** if you want to keep fighting please take it to DM's, but I would encourage you both to basically shut up
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:48:48 thank you
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:49:37 well tbh that does change things
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:51:12 wtf is that in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:52:38 alright, honestly not sure what to do here. so from what I understand blacbird was being annoying in voice chat and so you accused him of saying the N word just to shut him up?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:53:31 
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:53:51 did you at least ask blackbird to be quiet?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:55:12 I'm still not entirely sure why you did that knowing that it would cause an utter shitstorm.
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:55:32 Far from solve your problem
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:58:04 i don't think he meant that
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 10:58:05 ;p
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 11:02:18 It sounds like you've both done something wrong. I'm just going to let you off without any punishment to avoid an enormous argument, but next time I will take action. But please for the love of god, *don't cause a massive shitstorm in general.* I think it was largely bad luck, too, that most of the moderators were offline and couldn't deal with it. Happy?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 11:04:08 Please, just both of you shut up.
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 11:05:09 shut
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 11:05:10 up

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:20 Tbh my biggest qualm with this group is the aim was to create a toxicity free server and then two people joined
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:32 didn't they?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:43 i wasn't talking about you
contest-info 2019-08-08 16:55:18 ***CONTEST POLL***
What contest should we do this week?
1⃣ | Cargo delivery aircraft (planes, vtols, spaceships)
2⃣ | Industrial buildings (blast furnace, ore processing, asteroid mining)
3⃣ | Apollo style rockets (fairly obvious)
4⃣ | Original warships (no replications)
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:15 uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:18 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:40 who the
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:38:19 This sort of things happens like every other week lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:35 ya'll. I know this sounds weird considering he created motors, but rickje is a human. I'm sure he sends his most glitchy apologies
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:41:21 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:43:04 wait evan was <13?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:43:07 he didn't act like it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 18:44:53 
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 18:45:35 god knows
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 18:45:42 motor knows**
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 18:47:53 
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:35:50 👺
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:52:31 actually, I put the industrial complex and warships in there because look
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:52:40 i know you guys LOVE copying stuff off google images
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:52:45 but can't we try something new please?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:52:57 it doesn't seemed to have gained much traction though
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:53:16 and I bet you at least 2/3 if not more of the submissions will be replications
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:54:26 yeah. and that just goes to show, doesn't it?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:54:55 the main reason that flopped imo is because it was poorly chosen. you shouldn't just say to make an original creation and leave them to it without pointers...
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:11 which is why I actually set topics instead of just saying original creations
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:25 yes. and narrowing it down often helps
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:47 i admit the last original contest was shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:56:48 it just kind of pisses me off, you know? we have this game where you can build anything you want to, put custom mechanisms in, make everything look exactly like you want it... and people just copy things off google images.
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:56:58 idk, it's hard to explain but i feel quite strongly about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:25 i know we're not all the same but I feel much more satisfaction in building something original than replicating even if the original gets more hate
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:56 and yeah that quote is true. rough translation: humans are shit at using their imagination
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:02 yep. i said industrial complex because everyone *knows* what they look like, but you can make something original with it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:44 jets are the most retardedly overbuilt thing on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:50 apart from maybe commercial airliners
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:19 oh please DON'T say that
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:37 i have heard that quote used so bloody many times and it's always meaningless
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:57 kerbal space program is about space. STOP BUILDING FUCKING ROVERS AND BASES

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:04:55 whatever definition you give a carrier, that is...
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:10:07 -.-
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:10:28 ngl, i was going to upload a picture when that comment was posted
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:10:34 so the picture covered the nsfw comment

help 2019-08-09 00:45:04 use &suggest in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:45:50 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:45:57 bombers useful as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:17 OH
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:18 OF COURSE
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:26 that's why the blitz happened
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:33 it all makes sense now!
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:41 or are we talking plane crazy context?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:46:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:47:00 the vietnam war was a ridiculous failure on all US fronts
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:47:18 you really can't judge them by one war
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:47:25 which was a pathetic failure
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:48:07 bombers have countermeasures against these systems you know
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:48:55 which is bullshit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:49:07 well i'm out in my ufo
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:49:56 nothing is invulnerable from radar
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:50:36 you can try and make the craft less visible on radar
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:50:51 but full stealth is impossible
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:51:17 if you just spam bombers into capital cities nowadays there's no point lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:51:21 you don't do that though
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:51:23 do you?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:51:37 you choose your targets like an intellient person
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:51:43 OH YES
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:52:04 would you care to log into your roblox account
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:52:15 and screenshot your display in game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:53:08 <@!450038814199775242> would you please go into a roblox game and screenshot your display?

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:56:12 Launch the roblox player logged into your account
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:56:17 and send me a screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:56:41 So, you're under 13?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 00:56:48 Can you absolutely confirm this to me?

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 01:48:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 12:57:28 ❌
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:32:05 it's very unlikely you were kicked by an admin, lol
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:32:15 but judging by the big 'error code' it's a bug

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:40:44 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:40:49 it says 'creation must fly'
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:40:54 that's all
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:43:27 holy FUCK mee6
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:43:41 no i had to
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:43:44 it wouldn't prune
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:52:34 Contest is now open
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:52:37 fucking hell auto vote
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:53:28 what
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:53:35 rickje is the server owner
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:53:45 it wasn't always like that, voxel originally created the server
bug-reports 2019-08-09 13:53:50 i'm just an administrator
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:55:42 mee6 handled it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:55:58 that's practically the one thing mee6 has done right for me today
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:56:27 we do
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:56:30 for manual warnings
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:56:41 but mee6 has automoderation so
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:57:19 well maybe you shouldn't build a low effort creation to <#384025409945337856> then call it a meme even though it really is not funny, then ping a bunch of people to look at it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:08 let's not start another witch hunt or smth
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:20 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:36 i have a witch tower
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:37 with a motor on top
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:42 to feed me magical power
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:58:55 here you can see the Cyan Motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:59:13 therefore
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:59:16 i am the witch
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 13:59:23 yep
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:01:47 
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:01:57 motor liberty
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:02:12 wait let me have a go
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:02:42 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:03:05 i just used snipping tool
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:03:10 on discord background
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:03:28 i like this picture though
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:04:08 ?av
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:04:15 yesss
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:04:34 -light clapping-
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:04:49 did someone say lemon?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:06:00 oh lord
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:06:39 i sorta want to enter the contest too but i'm not sure how I want to build my submission
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:06:46 I want to do a spacecaft or VTOL for sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:06:49 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:07:13 oh yeah good point
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:07:21 i said in the voting it would be spacecraft too though
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:07:26 so probs will modify that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:10:14 ok updated
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:16:22 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:17:10 ufo will come to abduct you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:17:45 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:19:18 looks good like that to me
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:19:38 pc being personal computer or plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:19:58 i mean, for practical thinking, yes, longer
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:20:04 no shut it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:20:09 not you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:20:18 anyone who dares comment on what i said
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:20:55 it looks good but generic imo
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:21:33 i often try to break up flat surfaces like that with different types of wedges
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:21:41 it looks less realistic but often better end result
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:22:07 the bot will change it back straight away anyways lol
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:22:33 but yeah don't post unfinished builds here please
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:22:41 do that in <#478584971670454284> if you want advice
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:22:53 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:23:37 like i said, i mean, i know you guys love copying stuff off google images but i wanted to do something different for once
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:24:33 yah?
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:24:55 it's just much preferable if this channel isn't cluttered with unfinished builds
creations-chat 2019-08-09 14:25:17 technically it's not an *official* rule but it is fairly common sense
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 14:25:45 in what?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:42:40 i require votes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:44:24 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196> we require votes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:45:32 HE HAD AN AIMBOT OR SMTH
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:45:37 NOT MY FAULT
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:47:13 i fixed the message so it actually makes sense now <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:47:49 i told you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:47:53 he had a fucking aimbot
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:48:36 H BOMB INCOMING
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:50:02 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:50:16 their value is that you built something in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:50:24 the higher the rank the bigger achievment
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:50:56 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:51:22 same sort of system we have now
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:51:30 but tidied up a lot
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:51:55 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:52:13 the colours would be your highest rank
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 15:52:21 it can't really be done differently
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:01:41 because ranks are all over the place
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:02:15 wha
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:02:31 well it's about to be removed
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:02:34 so who cares lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:02:43 yes yes yes!
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:02:46 WE WILL PURGE
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:03:11 all rank will be rek
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:03:22 because we have literally reached the role limit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:03:27 and current ranks are kina messy
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:04:23 people with similar ranks will be transferred to prevent <#384025409945337856> being spammed to fucking death
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:01 traditions are traditions
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:02 aha
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:03 b0x
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:13 you told me to delete that one
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:16 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:05:33 oh yeah i must have missed that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:06:55 ok added floating fortress back
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:36:16 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:39:35 we're sorting it out vip
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:39:48 you will still be able to get colours some way
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:52:26 why no announcements
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:53:06 tbh i have no idea who can have community contributor
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:53:21 fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:53:27 also poll in <#490306593242611742> ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:53:54 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:55:18 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:55:47 good?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:55:47 
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:55:55 ..
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:57:31 we need votes ;_;
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 16:57:52 ok what are we doing then
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:00:03 ....
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:00:27 when are we starting the ranks conversion?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:00:42 i can't be bothered to wait
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:00:48 drop an h bomb noob
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:01:27 the people that downvoted didn't have shit in terms of ranks lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:01:31 most of them anyways
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:01:44 we found a compromise in the end
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:02:00 if you're any good at building you can change your colour ;p
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:02:19 voxel drop an Hbomb
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:02:41 I SAID DROP IT
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:04:45 we purging your shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:36:08 the ranks are going ricko mode rn
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:51:45 shut it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:51:50 😠
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:51:58 CENSORSHIP INCOMING
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:52:06 PREPARE TO DIE [2]
help 2019-08-09 18:11:54 screenshots
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:12:18 finally finished re-roling you little noobs
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:12:24 praise me because my hand is about to drop off
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:12:50 wait what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:13:27 probably to be archived
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:13:40 the new ranks are in place but not visible to everyone yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:14:31 i'd say we did a pretty good job with that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:14:37 no fuck ups as far as I can see
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:15:45 well we were actually going to do that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:16:13 i started compiling ranks just like that but it quickly became apparent that it was just impossible to properly measure speed or originality
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:16:46 i mean, i would much rather they were based on originality but it's kinda impossible
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:16:50 yes, but that's different
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:17:15 that's not as broad. we can just look at something and be like 'yeah ok that's been built before'
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:17:32 the same doesn't apply for mechs because designs are just too similar
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:17:50 as for speed, you can't use the speed indicator in most cases because the speed varies as the feet change position
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:18:18 what?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:18:55 lol what
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:19:40 wouldn't work. practically 99% of 2-legged walkers stop when they switch legs, and it's pretty hard to build a fast 4 legged walker
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:19:59 that... spider bot... thing with 8 legs is one of its kind, if you're thinking of that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:20:08 but i've never seen a mech go over 50sps
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:20:33 i spent literally hours typing up these ranks. i did take all this into consideration
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:11 👌
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:12 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:39 thank you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:42 it took me fucking ages
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:46 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:22:58 i had to re-role all 106 members with ranks to be merged ;_;
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:23:45 i'm curious to see whether people will actually try and get ranks now
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:23:56 psot
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:24:01 post**
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:24:04 ok.
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:24:15 yeah, we deleted all the old ones
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:26:02 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:26:09 i wasn't expecting you to finish like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:26:10 but ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:26:47 me
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:26:56 i was the one who purged the role 😤
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:27:18 challenges
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:27:29 oh and we're considering a role for people who get all 5 expert roles 😉
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:27:42 no, probably not
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:28:12 yes, i noticed from spending many late nights in <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:28:26 OH FUCK
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:28:31 we forgot to make the architect roles
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:28:37 i KNEW we would screw up something lmao
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:28:39 hold on
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:28:54 no wait they're there, but designer
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:29:01 ugh whatever i'll just rename them to architect
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:29:49 i'm starting to suspect i sent voxel an outdated version of the ranks document
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:30:54 ok whatever, if anything else crops up i'll just ping b0x or edit the ranks myself
creations-chat 2019-08-09 18:31:00 there's your rank
help 2019-08-09 18:55:59 sub role is now a thing
help 2019-08-09 18:56:23 i think that's everything we missed though
help 2019-08-09 18:56:34 something was bound to be fucked up, I'm just glad it isn't worse
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 18:57:41 did someone say ufo
help 2019-08-09 19:37:39 yes, no one was getting them tbh
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:37:55 what's going on now
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:39:35 you can change your colour as soon as you acquire an expert rank
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:39:50 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:40:28 alright done
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:40:41 look in <#609442446249820211> ffs
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:40:58 hold on, what for?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:41:07 eistle
creations-chat 2019-08-09 19:41:25 it's a fucking box
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:41:59 you've got it already ;p
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:42:05 unless someone else ranked you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:42:09 when i wasn't looking
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:42:16 um, who?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:42:27 turbo
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:43:05 yep, i should probably ask voxel to clarify on that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:51:03 oh fuck i just realised how similar III and moderator look
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:51:07 lemme adjust the colours
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:53:23 <@&609474000510255138> thoughts on having this colour as a role?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:53:28 moderator role
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:53:39 big cyan
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:55:54 done
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:56:27 i'm trying to figure out a new colour ._.
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:28:53 the ranks were redone
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:28:54 by me
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:29:09 yeah we P U R G E D all the old old old ranks
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:29:17 because we had literally reached the role limit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:29:22 nothing else for it really
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:29:41 yeah, i mean all the ranks that used to be the same sort of thing we have in <#609442446249820211> now
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:29:46 replicator ranks for instance
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:30:06 yep
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:30:21 it took me 2 hours to type the current ones up >,<
creations-chat 2019-08-09 20:32:46 done
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 20:33:07 i PURGED them

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 21:53:53 no
creations-chat 2019-08-09 21:59:05 i spent 2 hours writing out the rank system, then pretty much the whole of today figuring out the fine points with fonkl and voxel
creations-chat 2019-08-09 21:59:13 so i kinda want to use it
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:00:28 that was just before rank rework according to history
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:00:47 we weren't actually bothering to hand out ranks then because so many were going to be purged
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:00:50 alright turbo
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:01:08 uh hold on i'll find your stuff
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:01:49 tick
creations-chat 2019-08-09 22:04:40 i only found one rank worthy but if there's anything else do post it here

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:06:58 FUCK OFF
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:07:00 !!
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:07:05 no creepers
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:07:18 **the creeper thing isn't funny**
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:08:10 i wanted to have a seperate header for those actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:08:18 but it would be way too much work
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:08:21 to give it to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:08:27 yes that's allowed

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:52:55 this one is pretty fucking good
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:02 i played through it a while back
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:12 good point
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:13 idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:20 nope, max players one
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:21 ugh
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:27 it's really good too
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:53:58 storyline that saves your progress(i think), good animations, transitions, fantastic models, well created atmosphere
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:54:03 it's 23:54
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:54:07 screw you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:54:18 put your fucking aimbot away

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:56:12 why, you little c-
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:56:38 fonkl uses an aimbot
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 22:56:41 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:30:07 the total of upvotes = upvotes - downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:30:08 so no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:30:20 as is written in the description
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:30:22 i made sure of that
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:36:28 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:36:32 bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:38:34 ugh
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:38:38 the fucking pin limit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:39:12 yeah, we have too fucking many pins
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:40:17 i gtg sleep now
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:40:22 this time at 1 o clock
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:40:24 not 2 or 5
help 2019-08-09 23:42:01 hi pleb
help 2019-08-09 23:42:42 P U R G E
help 2019-08-09 23:42:55 is now aeronautical 3
help 2019-08-09 23:42:59 ranks were redone
help 2019-08-09 23:43:01 by me
help 2019-08-09 23:43:03 at 2am
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:44:58 what do ya'll think of the new ranks? anything need to be changed?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:45:31 the V's aren't that easy
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:45:40 there yu go
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:46:04 you need 16 upvotes and 2k blocks for most of them ;/
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:47:01 i have never seen a 10k creation
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:47:16 w8 lemme do a thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:47:57 you need to build 14.4k blocks to get all the V ranks
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:48:07 and get like 100 upvotes or smth
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:48:39 the I-IV ranks are supposed to be for people just getting into the thing, the V rank is to show you're an expert on it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:08 and we really want to have a rank for getting all V's to give people something to aim for
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:19 but voxel hasn't fucking responded to the 3 pings we sent him
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:29 over about 4 hours
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:37 we're still waiting
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:50:08 i build a lot of 300+ creations and then occasionally one big creation when I get a really good idea
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:50:52 the most retardedly overbuilt things submitted on this discord:
1) fighter jets
2) commercial airliners
3) wwii/i planes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:51:39 for boats it's famous battleships
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:51:59 actually i take that back
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:52:07 i see lots of destroyers and cruisers
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:52:10 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:53:48 i've built 2 carriers. first one was a flying carrier built in the early days of plane crazy... I was REALLY proud of that actually. good piece of engineering. no screenies sadly.second one idk if you can even call a carrier:
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:12 stfu
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:33 if i wanted to flex i'd show you my industrial command ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:43 actually fuck it ima show you my industrial command ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:06 
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:06 
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:08 you're 2 days late
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:08 
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:12 check pins
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:25 what do you suggest then?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:43 i deleted it but i tried all the generic boring colour schemes and they looked shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:48 colours were hard with this
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:53 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:56 too generic
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:16 i refuse to build generic things or paint them generic colour schemes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:19 end of fucking discussion
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:46 i am. i feel very strongly about this
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:15 something imaginative. i just wish people wouldn't limit themselves to copying off google or smth
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:39 i'm afraid about 20 people disagree
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:41 and 0 agree
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:46 w8 lemme find it
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:58:31 15 people in the end
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:58:46 dead
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:58:49 i murdered it personally
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:03 people like copying shit off google images
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:05 that's all
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:47 people make replicas because they can't be bothered to think of something
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:53 i know that from 2-3 years of experience
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:04 building something you make up yourself is honestly cooler in most cases providing it's half decent
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:39 Tbh it just pisses me off how you have an entire game where you can build whatever you desire, you have all these blocks available, you can make so many mechanisms... and people just build things from google
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:00 xook, explain why if it's so bad i got 15 upvotes and 0 downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:42 i'm not. it's easy to find more enjoyment from building original things if you invest a bit of time into it
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:52 yeah, in terms of looks, pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:42 i know they can. i'm not saying everyone enjoys it. i'm not saying everyone should build things from imagination. but it's just that so god damn many things are replicas
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:24 i built the game's first 2k part flying machine and it got corrupted and wiped
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:33 i was so mad lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:47 it was a UFO type thingy
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:50 hard to describe
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:56 xook
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:08 back then we were lucky to have more than 6 people online at a time
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:13 everyone knew everyone who was any good
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:29 and? problem?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:07:04 i just so rarely see any, i mean any, original builds that have any effort behind them... it's harder to learn how to do it but it's so much more satisfying when you're done. just goes to show the instant gratification aspect tbh.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:07:26 which isn't necessarily always a bad thing but in this sort of context it just... ugh
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:08:34 look, can you actually counter my arguments instead of comparing me to an entire generation
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:09:43 i'm not 'determining it.' just saying people >>should<< put more effort in because in the end it gives you more satisfaction
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:10:04 I'm pretty sure if I hadn't started building original things I would not be playing any more, ngl
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:10:48 honestly, the decline of creativity as you age is shown through so many mediums it's depressing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:18 👋
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:47 like i said, please counter my argument instead of comparing me to an entire generation ;/
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:25 smoke = rocket engines
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:28 rocket engines = yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:21 rocket engine particles were good at first but they're used so much that they're not a pretty sight anymore, lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:25 since they're well
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:26 an engine
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:58 ok fine your opinion is your opinion
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:15:12 NO U
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:16:20 if you mean 'be the change you want to see' then that's exactly what I'm trying to do. I tried to provide more creative options in the contest for instance, I only build priginal things
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:16:21 that all
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:16:48 👌
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:17:44 now, sorry about the heated argument but i feel very strongly on this topic even though i know most of the server is against me
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:18:38 ahaha
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:18:53 uh, really not sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:09 i think voxel manages community contributor roles so can't answer that
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:20:12 voxel said 100 subs recently but I really don't know
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:20:14 it's kinda confusing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:21:46 ay i can give myself expert rocket scientist
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:21:47 am happy
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:27 i have a... very interesting idea for a new building style but it's very hard to project how people would react
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:35 people would either think it's super cool or shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:24:04 wait it's 1:30 and i want to sleep before 2am unlike yesterday. 👋
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:24:42 that looks really nice ^^
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:24:47 the battleship
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:24:50 original build?
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:24:59 you need 16 upvotes for specialist V
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:25:07 huh that's really good for an original build
the-dump 2019-08-10 00:41:12 Yes
the-dump 2019-08-10 00:41:28 True
creations-chat 2019-08-10 00:45:03 Agree
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 09:24:31 If you really need to then create a weighing scale and put a ballast on the end
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 09:25:18 Noob make your own propellers using motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 09:25:21 MOTORS
help 2019-08-10 09:40:41 the requirement was easier when I typed it out
help 2019-08-10 09:41:02 I don't think voxel has actually tried to make a plane with a single propeller
help 2019-08-10 09:41:35 Ok
bug-reports 2019-08-10 19:56:56 known but but thanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:57:54 I hope so
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:58:01 But Roblox is roblox
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:17:33 No
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:19:21 Crab rave is gone
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:21:17 Wha
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:21:41 Starship in what context
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:21:58 spacecraft things basically?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:22:11 it depends on functionality
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:22:20 If it hovers vtol rank
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:22:32 If it flies horizontal then aeronautical
help 2019-08-10 20:28:31 you can now only change colours if you have an expert rank
help 2019-08-10 20:28:44 And yes a shit ton of thought went into this
help 2019-08-10 20:28:51 Like an hour of debate
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:31:09 Reminds me of the time I got vote kicked multiple times from a server in a Place With Airliners for flying inverted over the main airport in a Chinese 747 at top speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:31:42 It was seriously funny to see how many people got pissed off
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:32:39 And yeah don't expect people to try and fly like anything realistic in a Roblox game
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:32:55 Apart from the plane obsessed 9 year olds
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:34:05 it is kinda funny to see how the playerbase always splits in all flight games
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:34:39 You have people roleplaying like their life depends on it and getting angry at anyone even slightly interrupting
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:35:04 Then people just doing the stupidest things to piss those people off
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:35:46 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:36:16 SNOIC
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:00:44 we decided to do a compromise because the vast majority of people who downvoted didn't have shit in terms of ranks
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:01:03 we just delete them
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:01:07 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:01:14 Fuck your American dates
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:02:34 .
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:03:36 Sab I tried to convince xpert to do a @ heree but he ignored me.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:03:58 the rank voting
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:04:34 sab if you really want to believe that then go ahead but basically everything about the votes was decided by xpert
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:05:36 apart from that. fonkl, me and xpert in the end agreed to limit colours to people with expert rank so you actually had to do shit for them
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:05:52 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:06:08 oh er hold on
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:06:53 Afk
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:08:58 Sab I told you
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:09:55 We did what we did because the vast majority of people who downvoted didn't do shit for ranks, we wanted it encourage people to actually go for ranks, and it was a good compromise
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:10:46 holy fuck I told you about that too
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:11:00 I told xpert to ping here but he ignored me
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:11:46 sab, us 3 designed this whole system over the course of 4+ hours together. Actual thought went into this
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:11:50 Anyways afk
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:12:09 Ok fuck I have to counter that
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:12:13 Basically
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:12:31 NO it is largely NOT LUCK BASED. Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:12:45 Explain how it is luck based
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:14:05 Tat was multiple months ago. The server has changed and shit like that gets bombed now
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:14:10 AFK.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:23:06 back
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:23:35 who won the argument
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:24:26 oh wait he didn't read the ranks? lol ok, won't bother then
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:25:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:29:46 I am on the opposite side of the building to the WiFi router
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:29:48 Fml
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:37:10 ok I think I've crushed all opposition for noe
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:37:17 
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:37:24 Oops
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:37:27 Wrong button
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 22:37:43 I'm confident enough to write that lol
bug-reports 2019-08-10 22:39:37 I'll pass it on to rick
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 23:07:32 look at the last rank listed in <#609442446249820211> lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 23:08:36 Big grey square... My WiFi is so bad here
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 23:14:10 I sent voxel 2 different ranks: floating and flying fortress

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:48:50 That's not what I mean lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:49:41 I keep trying to build in a new style that I thought of but it's weird as fuck

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:57:39 Folding?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:58:00 use folding
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:58:15 There are tutorials in beginner guide for folding
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:58:27 Well you should have planned then :p
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:59:03 Don't then, just go for III or not for a rank at all
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:59:42 you just said you weren't planning on doing that
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:59:53 ok nvm
creations-chat 2019-08-11 23:00:29 is that a new lighting system or smth?
creations-chat 2019-08-11 23:00:36 or just graphics 10
creations-chat 2019-08-11 23:01:00 I wouldn't know, I run at about 20fps on graphics 1 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:01:29 This is not exactly what I had in mind
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:01:35 When I wrote up those ranks
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:02:30 people building larger ships than that instead of building floating platforms cramming as many blocks as possible in
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:03:19 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:04:18 Tbh I wouldn't build something like that as a combat vehicle anyways
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:05:04 I would either to for stealth or speed rather than, well, a average performing vessel like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:05:17 Or bulk
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:06:22 in public PvP servers?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:07:06 I don't even build stuff for PvP because the PvP meta is shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:07:37 Oh my word that looks disgusting. That WWII plane that is
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:08:17 yeah basically all respectable PvP planes are thruster sticks like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:09:06 that is hard as shit to code in tbh. At least a smaller building grid
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:09:15 Because of the way the game is coded
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:09:42 and adding even smaller blocks would start to be really overwhelming
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:10:02 Do not
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:10:03 Please
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:10:11 For the sake of everything
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:10:16 Do not build a meme vehicle

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:10:56 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:11:19 that is a boat with wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:11:51 If you want to build a proper flying boat at least bother to put the wings inside
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:11:55 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:12:21 Uh, I see
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:13:15 Actually no. Why would you want to make something that looks retarded
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:13:47 :/

plane-crazy 2019-08-15 21:21:29 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-15 21:21:38 That is a perfect thing to do with it
contest-info 2019-08-15 21:25:06 To clarify, since industrial builds is in the lead, your build may consist of either a real life factory segment(s) like blast furnaces and oil cracking towers, or fictional designs - both must clearly look as if they are used in manufacturing/industry but function is not required.
contest-info 2019-08-15 21:25:46 Simply put, build anything you want but it must look like it's used for industrial purposes
creations-chat 2019-08-15 21:27:37 Good concept, try detailing it a bit more
creations-chat 2019-08-15 21:28:21 And try building cylinders from blocks in the half blocks category, they are often better looking and more flexible

plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:57:19 it's 1am
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:57:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:57:25 thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:57:38 but i just can't be bothered to go back lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:57:51 i feel like there's going to be a lot of competition tbh
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:58:03 not a lot, but high quality
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:58:38 i just re used that because a lot of people wanted it last time but had it 2nd choice
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:58:45 ugh i can't speak properly
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:59:34 yeah, i made all the contest choices so that you couldn't just go into your screenshots folder and drag something into your discord window and leave
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 23:59:44 i felt we'd had enough of that...
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:01:00 fighters were cool for about 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:01:47 oh yeah and it's likely that channel linker bot might be dead forever
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:01:59 and there is practically no replacement
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:02:34 we had that before and it didn't work out
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:02:58 i tried using a 'gallery' bot to delete all non-images but it was really annoying to use
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:03:12 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:03:32 ?av
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:03:49 wait what's that command to show join position
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:03:57 ?whois
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:03:59 ayo
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:04:25 i don't remember you until like ~5 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:04:31 shhhh
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:04:58 fairly sure i remember you from galaxy discord or somewhere actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:05:19 oh, must have been someone else
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:05:24 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:05:47 what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:06:09 yeah like i said it's 1am, late night yesterday too
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:06:16 i should really get to bed..
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:07:39 ngl, i'm really worried about the channel linker...
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:07:53 ..
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:08:11 do you not remember when the server first started
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:09:43 like i said, I tried to set up a bot on that 'elite' server to delete anything that wasn't an image and it was pretty shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:10:42 i could probably edit the code myself but the problem is hosting, because no one is willing to cough up the money to host the thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:10:57 i have a raspberry pi that might be able to host it but i really don't know
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:12:19 the motor will help me
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:12:33 11 vs 2
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:13:02 yeah what even happened to imperial
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:13:28 i'm in another time zone to most of ya'll..
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:14:23 well he probably got sick of the toxicity here
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:15:48 you are a high integer
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:17:19 alright off to get some sleep at last
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:20:01 ...
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:20:49 check pins
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:21:01 It's a promise :]
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:25:24 wait, so Dyno is posting dead memes when people fake ping mas but won't ban a <13?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 00:25:41 Oh there we go

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:30:18 I'm on tablet and haven't even got Roblox installed :_:
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:30:36 We had something like that submitted
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:30:41 But with cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:30:54 What
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:32:08 10/10 Inventor worthy
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:33:10 yes
the-dump 2019-08-18 18:33:53 Fear
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:34:11 I drink tea ffs
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:34:52 No crumpets actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:35:02 But I eat cream teas
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:35:29 A cream tea is not a cup of tea
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:35:40 It is scones + cream + jam + tea
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:35:51 Very local British dish
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:36:11 Something original
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:36:20 No it's a garage door lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:36:41 Well, I wouldn't know off the top of my head lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:36:45 Pretty common
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:36:58 It's a door
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:37:12 Yes it is unless you have decent creativity
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:37:27 It's NOT supposed to be an easy rank
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:38:00 You're not supposed to make something you can name
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:38:28 CREATIVITY NO LONGER EXISTS
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:39:59 Ok don't go for Inventor then
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:40:43 Someone built a calculator for instance
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:41:44 Not it isn't, not any more
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:41:50 Yeah I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:42:08 There was a discussion about napalm in the mod chat is pretty much all I remembe but idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:43:25 We would prefer if it wasn't real world but if it really impresses us...
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:44:02 Well yeah pretty much the whole rank is opinion based
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:44:12 And can't be done much other way
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:44:26 A vote is pretty much agreed as the best way to decide on it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:44:50 someone censor them
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:45:20 Because people would probably just upvote everything lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:47:01 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:49:12 you could probably make a crane entirely using motors as the only mechanical parts but I can't get onto robloxmto build one rn :-:
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:51:02 Lol no
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:51:16 Nerd!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:51:54 you don't need effort for an inventor rank, you need imagination
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:52:24 What
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:52:26 Yes it is
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:52:41 What the absolute fuck are you on about
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:52:45 No
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:52:50 It really isn't
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:53:08 We vote based on how impressive the MECHANISM is
creations-chat 2019-08-18 18:53:24 Picture?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:53:41 What
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:53:43 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:54:32 Well try thinking outside the box for once instead of modifying existing ideas or replicating irl ones
creations-chat 2019-08-18 18:54:54 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:56:02 That's the thing you refuse to get
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:56:10 It's not supposed to be nameable
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:56:23 A dwell mechanism?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:58:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:58:56 Everyone would have inventor then
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:58:58 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:59:59 possibly, but it's probably been built before
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:00:10 Depends what the mods vote
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:00:19 Alright go ahead
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:00:29 Yah doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:01:25 I know the feeling lmao
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:01:40 My Mars mission rocket a while back had about 40 keys
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:01:45 Could not remember them
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:01:51 Alright will repost to mods
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 19:02:23 For controlling the rocket...
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:32:42 Why did rickje fix that but :-:
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:32:53 It was incredibly useful
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:35:12 What
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:35:23 how the fuck can that be abused
bug-reports 2019-08-21 17:36:43 had to deal with that a lot several months ago when trying to make a fast controllable craft... No rockets or magnets then so it was much harder to do with wings. definitely might be worth looking into
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:37:31 I really don't see the point of fixing these bugs
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:45:22 Yeah that is pretty much unfixable as far as I know
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:46:29 Since the motors work on this torque system and tiny changes and innacurate calculations mean that the motor spins slightly faster or slower
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:46:32 I think..
contest-info 2019-08-22 12:08:03 ```REMINDER that there will be no voting period, contrary to previous contests - don't post your build at the last minute```
general 2019-08-22 12:36:00 Have decided that I'm not going to spend $60 on a slightly improved version of a game I got for about $20, because that's a pretty ridiculous price to ask for
general 2019-08-22 12:38:21 Seriously, the new version looks amazing but 60 dollars is just wayyy too much to ask for. Count me out
general 2019-08-22 18:10:50 Ok nice
general 2019-08-22 18:13:41 Vip making it clear he doesn't care even though everyone already knows episode 2951
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 20:35:53 Oil in plasma form?
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 20:37:02 Agreed
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 20:37:15 9/10 best bug
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:14:38 Actually motors being broken is the best bug
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:15:05 Oops
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:15:26 Yes?
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:16:09 It was already broken :(
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:16:24 It was a good ga-
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:16:29 --?!
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:16:46 OH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:00 mining inc is a really good game
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:27 I am but mostly on random private servers
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:38 Well actually not in the past few weeks
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:49 Because I've been travelling a lot
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:18:18 No, and won't be able to get on until about a week and 3 days
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:20:18 What I basically did was design the ranks, go to the alps, then flew back and spent until about 2am building a factory for the contest, then flew to the Czech Republic at 6am tired as fuck
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:22:42 Also decided to take over the contests because voxel wasn't posting anything and plus I wanted people to try and build original things for once
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:22:59 So far it's turned out better than I expected actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:23:09 Let's see
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:23:22 Yeah we really don't
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:23:43 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:31:36 There are different types of intelligence lol
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:39:50 Yeah lumber Inc broke a while baxk
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:39:50 I used to spend hours in the sawmill lol
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:40:18 Uh, those were sent in the wrong order anyways lol
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:40:40 Widgeon made mining inc
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:40:45 And lumber
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:41:00 Same concepts
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:41:11 Mining inc was a lot more refined tbh
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:41:50 lol ikr
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:42:37 I had this argument once with a guy who wanted to votekick me because I was 'not doing any real work, just pushing around logs in a bulldozer',
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:43:14 Ngl I didn't realise it was bait but I was hecking new to the whole internet thing back then
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:43:42 Diggers were fun until they got stuck
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:44:00 But I always get jealous of that massive payed one :-:
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:44:27 Yeah
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:44:30 I think

the-dump 2019-08-22 21:46:03 I can't really see much from my mobile :/
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:46:34 Did my WiFi just die again?
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:47:37 I'm not sure if it's legit tbh
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:48:07 Yeah on second thoughts it's probably not legit
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:48:10 Ah
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:48:49 Ok definitely legit
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:49:02 Bookmarked for when I can play in 2 weeks
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:49:03 Ugh
plane-crazy 2019-08-22 21:50:18 What did I walk into

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:30:25 how the fuck does a seven block 'helicopter' get 4 upvotes 0 downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:30:54 and then this
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:30:59 gets 7 upvotes 3 downvotes?
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:31:48 you already have
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:32:22 yeah, i stopped posting to creations not too long ago... and not least because i got something considered impossible

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 09:43:06 telling people not to minimod is minimodding
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:26:07 i keep most of my builds until i need the save space
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:26:11 for flexing purposes
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:26:21 ..
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:26:40 i had my saturn v for the longest time for instance
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:26:43 kept modifying it

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:28:14 school is starting the day after tomorrow for me so i feel depressed af right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:30:37 let's not..
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:31:05 just realised the last proper thing i posted to creations is my original rocket from like 5 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:31:09 let's stop that please
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:31:19 **i said stop**
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 11:31:55 this chat has descended into chaos rather quickly
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:55 left/right steer thing
creations-chat 2019-09-01 12:04:38 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:07:40 er
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:07:42 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:08:30 evidently it's because we removed 'i read the rules' rank which has a permission to not allow you to add emojis
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:08:43 but it is allowed for 'ranked'
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:09:04 to be honest i have no idea what on earth voxel is doing with the i read the rules rank but here we are
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:09:07 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:17:08 i just read the chat history
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:17:19 what the fuck i just want to play sins of a solar empire
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:23:34 oh my lord what has voxel done#
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:59:27 vipemire version 1
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:59:38 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:59:42 that
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 12:59:59 oh wait you need a rank to do that
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:00:07 <#609442446249820211> any rank will suffice
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:06:19 why is this here
the-dump 2019-09-01 14:35:51 how do you suggest we do it then?
contest-info 2019-09-01 14:38:55 ```!IMPORTANT!
From now on I am warning anyone who posts off-topic images to contest creations since I've had to delete about 5 from this contest already and it is starting to really get on my nerves```
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:46:47 everyone does tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:47:01 but rick can't because importing new terrain overwrites existing terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:47:36 so unless someone makes a whole new map then there's pretty much nothing much for it because rickje's time would be much better spent on scripting n shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:48:00 plus the roblox terrain generator has absolutely tiny limits
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:48:35 in theory though it might be possible to use a plugin to create low-poly style terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:48:48 which could be expanded quite far
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:49:06 also i somehow doubt he wants to after pouring a bunch of effort into lava and control rooms n shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 14:49:15 on this map
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 15:45:10 he is the H E D G E H O G
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 15:56:14 What
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 15:56:39 hold on how on earth can waterwheels stabilise a rocket?
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 15:56:47 could*..
creations-chat 2019-09-01 16:56:37 ok first of all don't ping rickje for things like that
creations-chat 2019-09-01 16:56:50 second of all, nowhere near inventor worthy as vip said
creations-chat 2019-09-01 16:57:42 and vip i just went through creations to delete most of the latest low effort builds and i'm ngl there are indeed a huge excess of them
creations-chat 2019-09-01 16:58:16 oh fuck
creations-chat 2019-09-01 16:58:18 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:29:42 [again]
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:29:47 what rank?
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:32:02 Technically 21
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:32:37 Alright done

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:46:59 
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:47:46 i'm thinking dark cyan and light gray
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:47:58 yah, maybe
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 18:59:16 how do the colours on this look then?
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 19:00:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 19:02:18 alright lemme try that
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 19:11:20 <@!255361087262818304> what do you think?

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 21:03:46 HORSE
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 21:26:23 that actually looks pretty decent for an original build
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 21:26:59 i tried using OBS and got about 7 fps with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 21:27:10 i mean that it's hard to build original builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 21:27:18 harder than replications

plane-crazy 2019-09-02 22:49:31 ok we going on bois
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 22:50:40 definitely going to re-use some ideas in future contests
contest-info 2019-09-02 22:54:50 <@&618201103388901377>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 08:43:07 <@221487880487436288> Terrain scenes means sort of a collection of similar objects presented on terrain or otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 08:43:39 Think stuff like those model train sets with trees and stations n shit packed with them
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 08:46:25 Also general is dead now I see :-:
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 08:46:34 All because one person complained
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:47:17 What is going on here
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:47:42 Oh fuck I have to leave for school now
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:47:53 :_: bye
general 2019-09-03 15:36:35 so uh, i just found out that all my school's maths teachers had a massive fucking barbecue and uploaded pictures onto facebook over the summer holidays
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:39:07 ok so i spent some time thinking about why this server is suddenly inactive as shit and i narrowed it down to 3 reasons:
1) 90% of what was posted here was basically shitpost, arguments and random toxicity
2) katze was banned 
3) no one actually plays plane crazy any more
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:40:26 by inactive i meant that no one says anything here any more, no matter what it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:40:37 and yes, reason 1
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:41:37 yeah me too tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:42:03 i was playing devils advocate ;/
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:42:13 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:42:55 tbh i was still rather undecided on the matter but wanted to know exactly what ya'll held as opinions about it
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:45:05 i still held a bit doubt about your 'no memes!' thing because i really wasn't sure what the side effects would be
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:45:06 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:45:18 steal moms credit card not to fund roblox, but rickje
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:46:53 biggest worries i had was retaliation and people just ignoring the new rules
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:47:36 and mods therefore just not enforcing it after a period of time by gradual degradation of the value of those warns
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:48:52 yes, but just that the whole system gradually decays because it's just not seen as a huge offense to post an off topic meme
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:49:11 so mods just don't bother warning for it eventually, maybe a verbal warning at some point
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:50:02 oh btw plzkillmenow is has found a new audience to spam propaganda at
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:50:37 extremely toxic guy who joined somewhere near the beginning of the server
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:50:44 OG plane crazy player but stupidly toxic
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:50:54 ..
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:52:40 ok so now i have two options:
1) force the conversation to move to off-topic, which in most cases kills it
2) not enforce the rules and therefore preserve activity
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:52:57 and this is what i was talking about
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:53:33 or they just won't bother
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:53:55 ok possible compromise
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:55:30 general is renamed to plane-crazy to promote discussion of the game.. that was tried for a bit yesterday but not enforced properly
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:56:09 going to try it again and keep it over a period of a few days and see what happens
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:56:18 but we need long term results to know tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:57:39 asking in modchat
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:00:37 yee
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:00:51 no

contest-info 2019-09-03 16:24:35 ```WEEKLY CONTEST```

`OBJECTIVES`
- Build a 'terrain scene.' The definition for this contest is a collection of related objects presented on terrain or any other such setting. For instance, a 'fortress' scene might include a main building in the centre of the map with multiple objects such as ammunition crates, turrets, fences, etc scattered around. Scenes can also be in various environments(not necessarily from real life though), for instance a 'sea' setting with a school of fish, small island with a lighthouse, sailing ship, fin to indicate shark, etc.

`RESTRICTIONS`
- Scene must be over 300 blocks
- Scene must contain at least 5 different objects unless it's largely terrain-focused

`INSTRUCTIONS`
 - Post your submission to <#609381270237216768> where it will automatically be reposted to <#609381333243920384> to be voted on. You may only submit one creation. Three winners will be chosen, and there will be no voting period so don't wait last minute to post.
- Moderators reserve the right to remove any submissions deemed to break the contest rules or be off-topic.

`DATES`
Contest closes on 10/9/19 at 20:00 GMT. I will post a reminder before then but make sure to have your creation ready by that date.
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:25:05 can ya'll speak in contest submissions?
contest-info 2019-09-03 16:28:06 <@&618201103388901377>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:36 sails?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:51 well everyone voted for it so
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:55 🤷
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:29:51 i don't know what your problem is with me trying to get people to build new things
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:30:19 we've already exhausted most generic contest ideas anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:30:26 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:32:29 to be honest i don't see the point of contests if people don't build things for them. it's literally just dragging a month-old screenshot out of a folder and forgetting about it. sure, you might say winning but there are basically no benefits apart from the role
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:02 imo it's just good to try and get people to build new things instead of trying to get as many submissions as possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:37 you can argue with voxel about that
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:48 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:34:41 well anyways, even if we did have individual ranks there'd still be barely any benefit ;/
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:34:51 you'd probably forget about it within a week
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:35:28 **flashbacks**
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:36:21 also what's with the sudden torrent of stuff in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:36:48 pvp not worth it imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:37:14 no competition once you build a tiny thruster stick... or everyone else is using tiny thruster sticks
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:37:18 me neither

creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:18:37 now, as for advice
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:19:56 needs a more consistent colour scheme imo, more colour applied to hull as well. slightly more detailing still needed, for instance different style wedges. also the superstructure imo should have a different ending <@!435464209677942784>
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:20:40 actually tbh i'm not entirely sure about the ending
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:21:00 don't build ships that much
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:21:32 but i would encourage trying different tones of that grey, maybe R/G/B to contrast it
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:22:32 rick stop

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 20:34:25 ..
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 20:35:18 tfw rick reposts a link that crashes clients to mod-chat to show us that someone is breaking the rules
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 20:35:40 it's not general anymore
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 20:35:42 😤
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 21:32:30 ya'll contest winners are about to get spam pinged
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:00:27 thoughts on <#618554562613215253> ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:00:57 people are completely unable to find inspiration from <#384025409945337856> and the contest information channel is filled with shitpost
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:02:25 which of these rules sets do ya'll think is better?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:02:31 
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:03:15 i need opinions
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:04:31 <@!615531960328126484> have you considered entering the contest with that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:04:58 they're mostly a reformat but also changed some rules
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:05:35 just takes two seconds to post the screenshots. even if you don't win, it's good to see how well you do
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:06:30 <#609381270237216768>
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:07:08 terrain scenes, yes
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:08:17 no
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:08:22 just the creation required
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:08:55 yes
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:09:35 wanted to see how the community would handle a slightly different contest
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:09:44 evidently no one's very interested
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:09:49 except for a few people
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:09:57 alright
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:10:28 well voxel decided to keep the walloftext that we have in <#533294912586645521> so bad luck 🤷
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:11:13 send as many as you want
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:11:20 hmm, i might build another starship today
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:11:47 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/618524747550162944/starship1.PNG
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:11:58 in the style of this one i built earlier
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:12:18 seems to have actually been fairly well received
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:12:23 unlike most original builds sadly ;/
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:12:31 detail is the absolute key
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:12:33 and practice
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:12:55 no one likes big flat surfaces so you have to vary it
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:14:09 yeah wedges can be challenging considering there are so many types
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:14:23 i actually struggled quite a bit when the half blocks/wedges all came out
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:15:36 can you show me an example?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:15:45 i might be able to give criticism
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:17:19 well, personally i've been playing for 3 years to be able to build that 🤷 i think it's largely experience, knowledge and practice
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:17:55 tbh i reckon most people who started off so long ago had a huge advantage
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:17:59 community was much better
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:18:14 you could get some very good feedback if you
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:18:17 ..?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:18:21 why were you banned

general 2019-09-04 15:45:06 actually on that note ima get onto vip 1 to build another starship
general 2019-09-04 15:45:26 this time i want to plan it so i don't spend 30 minutes cramming helium into every last possible place
general 2019-09-04 15:46:00 done
general 2019-09-04 16:04:54 👀
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:14:50 beginning of my starship
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:14:52 again
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:16:27 yes i started lore yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:16:40 lemme find it
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:16:58 non poetic version:
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:17:00 this takes place in an alternate reality on a moon that orbits a low density small planet and is heated just enough by gravity from the planet to allow a sea of liquid water underneath its icy surface. a civilization evolved over billions of years thanks to the planets lack of massive planets disrupting other orbits(lucky coincidence)
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:17:08 the low gravity of the moon means very little oxygen so the civilization uses some mysterious chemical reaction that interacts with the sun's more dangerous spectrum of radiation to produce energy
the low gravity of the moon and its planet meant that the civilization was able to launch into space a long time before we did, however, material was largely organic since very little metal was found on this moon. steampunky creations here
soon enough, the civilization took advantage of their spacefaring ability to harvest metals from asteroids. this led to fast development in electronics among other things and made viable the first autonomous spacecraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:17:20 this is one of the first spacecraft built, largely from organic material(on earth, wood. there... low gravity meant plants could grow huge. the strongest trees were replanted from over many centuries, creating a gene pool for desirable building material).
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:18:22 this ship will be much larger and equipped with a solar sail or something like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:19:17 i'm trying to do them all in s specific style but have a go if you want
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:19:34 my only request is that you detail the absolute fuck out of it
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:20:03 oh for you own world
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:20:07 alrighty
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:20:54 i find that building with 'no flat surfaces of more than about 4 blocks long' generally really helps
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:21:20 and clear progression thoughout the ship... basically shrink sections toward the front and back
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:22:15 what sort of designs?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:22:34 would love to see those
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:23:06 if you built those ships they could eventually meet my starships/humans
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:23:20 no u
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:23:24 big warships
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:23:25 fun
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:24:21 oh my lord yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:24:28 vtols were the only thing i built then
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:24:47 basically a bunch of wing panels attached to a stick with engines on a motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:25:52 uh... fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 16:25:54 this is going to be a challenge
creations-chat 2019-09-04 16:26:03 ?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 16:26:32 not too much detail, mostly. quite a simple design
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 18:14:34 yo
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 18:15:02 about to make that discord server, can you remember anyone else who wanted to join?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 18:17:57 aright thanks

help 2019-09-04 18:37:00 a motor with high torque will be able to carry more
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 19:00:29 what you need testing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 19:02:22

general 2019-09-04 20:02:00 i just wanted to know
general 2019-09-04 20:04:59 also can someone explain what the fuck is going on
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:18:00 this technically means you have an infinite mass
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:18:26 this in turn means you warp spacetime so fucking much nothing can exist

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:32:28 oh dear
general 2019-09-04 21:21:09 this is one of the rare instances where i actually want vipEmpire to show his ass
general 2019-09-04 21:21:14 need someone to proof check this:
general 2019-09-04 21:21:15 The planet is heated through gravitational tidal force. This works similar to how tides work on 'Earth' - huge quantities of water are moved by the Earth's first moon's gravitational pull. The opposite in fact happened to the Earth's first moon, where huge plains of rock were pulled by the Earth forming many of the observable surface features. 

In this context, the Idrian's home moon was pulled by the main planet, causing huge stress and heat to form inside the moon. Inertia also tried to keep the planet going around its orbit, which meant the planet was slightly 'squeezed' and elongated on one side.
general 2019-09-04 21:24:46 lore
general 2019-09-04 21:24:54 for civilization
general 2019-09-04 21:25:01 want to try and be realistic about it
general 2019-09-04 21:25:29 
general 2019-09-04 21:25:44 i also know that vipEmpire would immediately grill every tiny detail about this the moment he saw it
general 2019-09-04 21:26:42 mostly i'm just curious about the topic, is it really so weird to be curious about something?
general 2019-09-04 21:26:59 can't find any comprehensible information online
general 2019-09-04 22:22:21 Vip please :_:
general 2019-09-04 22:25:49 The moon was elongated
general 2019-09-04 22:25:52 Not the planet
general 2019-09-04 22:26:16 Lemme change that
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 22:27:01 ahaha
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 22:27:05 Very nice pic
general 2019-09-04 22:27:24 Still undecided, but roughly humanoid
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 22:28:02 RICK NEEDS LAG BOMBS
general 2019-09-04 22:29:33 Yes. my thoughts were they would love on the surface and minimise heat consumption
general 2019-09-04 22:29:57 And evolution would support this because there is much less competition on the surface
general 2019-09-04 22:30:36 Still thinking about that, ngl
general 2019-09-04 22:31:03 Would it be possible for them to generate their own heat?
general 2019-09-04 22:31:08 Biologically
general 2019-09-04 22:31:51 Some process like photosynthesis maybe
general 2019-09-04 22:32:07 Yeah, conditions here would be very different though
general 2019-09-04 22:32:58 it is kind of ambitious
general 2019-09-04 22:34:23 hibernation to conserve heat for long periods of time, plus some sort of biological heat storage mechanism... Soak up sun's IR light
general 2019-09-04 22:34:42 Or longer periods of sleeping
general 2019-09-04 22:35:32 Oh, yes
general 2019-09-04 22:36:32 So basically black humanoids that semi-hibernate to conserve heat and have a biological system that operates at very low temperatures
general 2019-09-04 22:37:47 Yep, I like that
general 2019-09-04 22:37:59 Only other problem is building materials
general 2019-09-04 22:38:28 Not sure how fauna could grow on the top without traditional photosynthesis
general 2019-09-04 22:38:35 For wood like material
general 2019-09-04 22:39:06 And there's only so much you can do with solid ice... Would be extremely difficult to harvest at this point
general 2019-09-04 22:39:16 Yeah, but crude tools made from what?
general 2019-09-04 22:39:45 Possibly
general 2019-09-04 22:41:08 Maybe
general 2019-09-04 22:41:27 Other problem is it would take a lot of precious energy to do this
general 2019-09-04 22:42:28 Alright got it
general 2019-09-04 22:43:47 Huge plants grow in hydrothermal vents and near the core using thermosynthesis and thanks to the low gravity. The species comes from the ocean, but the ability to swim doesn't disappear before they reach industrial revolution
general 2019-09-04 22:44:26 Respiration not evolved yet so they can dive for long periods of time
general 2019-09-04 22:44:35 However it would still take lots of energy
general 2019-09-04 22:44:47 And be a very long distance to go
general 2019-09-04 22:45:08 Well, not that bad, but having to swim up with all that material would be hard
general 2019-09-04 22:45:32 I guess 1/5 gravity might help
general 2019-09-04 22:45:45 Eh, I reckon that should be fine
general 2019-09-04 22:46:23 So they'd also be more lightweight
general 2019-09-04 22:46:35 Apart from heat storage mechanism
general 2019-09-04 22:46:43 ...possibly
general 2019-09-04 22:46:56 Alright that's good enough for me
general 2019-09-04 22:47:04 Thanks for the help, I appreciate it
general 2019-09-05 17:00:02 playing innovation inc like
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 17:26:02 fully folded, uncoloured front of my starship... thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 17:26:11 main body will continue from here
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 17:30:30 feedback 2019 style, hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:05:19 starship meetup
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:12:03 yeah mine too, but i didn't want the right one to look like the odd one out
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:13:15 me and gop
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:13:25 gopnitza that is
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:35:29 building my new starship... thoughts so far? uncoloured
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:35:51 
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:35:57 god, it looks massive in those two pictures
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:59:36 how should I fill this area?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 18:59:50 between the cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:01:11 do you have any actual feedback?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:02:41 yeah, i thought possibly, but tbh i already have the rest of the ship looking mechanial so this might be better off being crew/cargo or smth
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:03:18 not entirely sure actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:03:27 still deciding on a proper purpose
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:04:33 this is going to be a capital ship of some description
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:04:39 but i want to build bigger
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:20:17 just trying different detailing and then suddenly-
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:20:19 i did the winter event ._.
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:21:54 i opened the skiis section and that popped up
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:22:00 i'm able to place them
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:22:14 yeah happened again
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:22:39 back to work
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:22:43 xD
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:25:32 ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:25:38 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:25:39 lemme check
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:26:24 it's possible it was just a one-off bug of course
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:36:19

plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:55:39 spent like 4 hours building my starship again
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 19:56:55 a new one i mean

plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:39:30 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:39:52 aaa my fridge is broken so no milk with my earl gray
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:39:55 UGH
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:40:00 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:40:14 ok bye, behave please
the-dump 2019-09-05 20:43:22 ok you can do it here
general 2019-09-05 20:43:42 my tea is NOT going well atm
general 2019-09-05 20:43:50 fridge is broken so no milk
general 2019-09-05 20:43:59 didn't boil enough water so had to add cold
general 2019-09-05 20:44:06 and some idiot licked the sugar spoon
general 2019-09-05 20:44:20 it's 10pm
the-dump 2019-09-05 20:44:55 the motor inquisition did you mean
general 2019-09-05 20:45:18 if you want to eat raw sugar
general 2019-09-05 20:45:27 at least bother to get your own fucking spoon
general 2019-09-05 20:45:31 for GOODNESS SAKE
general 2019-09-05 20:45:54 yes
general 2019-09-05 20:46:15 me too
general 2019-09-05 20:46:26 aw
general 2019-09-05 20:46:29 bye
general 2019-09-05 20:46:32 👋
general 2019-09-05 20:47:42 what should I play in the 10 minutes before i have to go to bed
general 2019-09-05 20:47:59 i was going to do ksp but it's broken as shit right now for some reason
general 2019-09-05 20:48:14 everything doesn't have proper textures and looks dark as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:48:56 ok i just thought of this super elegant system
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:49:03 so basically
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:50:42 players can create a 'custom block' by placing eight blocks in a 2x2x2 cube and then highlighting them using functionality similar to the screwdriver tool. pressing a button would condense these blocks into *one block* which could be placed from a building section for only custom blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:50:59 air could also be selected
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:51:28 no, too hard to code
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:51:31 +kpc
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:51:44 this would be much easier
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:51:54 no, it wouldn't
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:51:58 in theory not anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:52:25 the game technically just has to save data on three things: type, colour and position
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:52:34 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:52:45 it wouldn't take any more save data than a normal block
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:52:50 however small you made it
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:53:14 would allow infinitely detailed builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:53:19 it would be incredible
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 20:53:59 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:02:36 probably not possible +kpc
bot-central 2019-09-05 21:08:59 holy fuck my hands
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:09:36 wait what
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:10:37 <@!260797229068058634> yes, I know... save data is counted by the total this data takes. i was saying that colour, data and block are the main pieces of information that is saved as this text
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:11:18 also
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:11:22 about the tea
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:11:35 i finished it and heard this terrible cracking sound downstairs
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:11:51 went down there to find my industrial steam boiler still running
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:00 must have forgotten to turn on the auto-shutoff valve
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:28 boiler is OK now
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:32 don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:39 i will still be able to make tea
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:41 :]
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:12:57 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:02 and add milk and sugar
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:05 what?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:38 you americans throw meat and onions or smth between bread and eat it
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:49 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:54 tea
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:13:56 is better
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:09 the builds i see are always shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:18 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:19 fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:30 you don't HAVE a bloody queen
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:35 so there
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:41 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:14:59 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:00 nelson
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:01 good man
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:27 would you all mind looking at my wall of text in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:40 tl;dr add custom blocks that you can create with a 2x2x2 grid of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:46 oh lord
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:48 good point
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:15:57 but i don't want to kill the chat ;-;

plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:45:28 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:45:50 wdym?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:46:06 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:46:32 can you send a picture of your plane?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:47:49 yesss
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:47:51 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:47:53 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:48:34 hold on, are you rotating those engines to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:48:55 generally wouldn't recommend doing that
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:49:19 instead put a separate engine onto either side and configure them to A and D
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:49:29 did you disable motor resetting?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:50:12 also your center of lift is very far back, i would suggest bringing it forward
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:50:30 i would use individual thrusters for turning though
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:50:47 this system is inefficient and scales badly to big builds... plus the physics act weirdly
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:51:53 for example set the red engine increase power setting to A and enable on/off only, and set the black engine to D and set on/off only on this craft
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:52:17 wait hold on i was looking for that build
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:52:29 really liked the wing design but couldn't find it anywhere
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:52:40 and then i just open a random video to show an example and it randomly appears
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:52:56 
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 21:53:12 it's from pre-alpha so no paint or anything
bot-central 2019-09-05 22:00:51 done
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 22:02:08 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:07:16 ok i'm actually impressed as fuck with the stuff in <#609381333243920384>
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:10:59 finished engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:11:18 thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:11:34 
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:13:15 whole thing, unfolded

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:13:31 not coloured yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:13:41 what do ya'll think
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:13:52 do you not like it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:13:59 why not
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:14:01 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:14:07 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:14:14 i literally built one thing with this lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:14:24 this is the second build
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:14:45 what?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:15:06 people say that with every spaceship lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:15:14 where though?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:15:26 that would look horrible
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:16:07 not coloured yet, usually has a big effect
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:16:46 already tried a couple of things to extend the main big body toward the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:16:53 i don't think it's really possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:48:48 generic

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 19:53:19 if time went faster or slower you wouldn't be able to tell, your brain would function at the same relative speed
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 19:53:20 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 19:53:36 so technically time has no speed
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 19:53:43 just no

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:11:45 scroll up a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:11:50 i wrote a massive wall of text
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:11:59 idk how it would be to code
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:12:02 but it would be amazing
general 2019-09-06 20:12:09 bye
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:12:21 yeah probably pretty hard but i'm not sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:12:27 look in suggestions and scroll up
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:12:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:13:01

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:13:58 
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:14:19 pistons
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:14:27 conveyor and motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:14:39 could be expanded later
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:14:47 and 2x2x2 would be hugely time consuming anyway
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:15:06 *what about my suggestion*
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:15:44 yes but it can't be done that easily with the current system
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:15:46 it's hardcoded
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:15:52 tons of stuff would need to be changed
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:05 this would just be adding on
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:25 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:26 NO
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:30 STOP RIGHT THERE
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:43 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:16:43 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:17:06 that
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:17:11 is NOT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:17:22 have you ever played build your own mech?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:17:33 about 40% of all creations i saw were prebuilt
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:17:40 they weren't even GOOD prebuilt creations
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:18:27 plane crazy flight simulator 2019
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:18:33 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:18:50 i have a feeling rick might be reading my suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:18:55 or maybe not
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:19:31 if not then I default to 'NEW MAP' because this one is shit rn
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:19:42 well not shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:19:46 but incredibly outdated
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:20:05 needs to be bigger
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:20:16 more exploration of terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:20:23 more interesting places to test creations
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:20:40 needs to be more in line with the game's style
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:20:57 a bit more refined(no drops into the void around the edges)
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:21:04 interesting scenery
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:21:34 people with slow people
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:21:47 how does that relate to this
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:22:07 terrain causes barely any lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:22:16 rick did you read my suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:22:46 ***RICKJE129, YOU READ MY FUCKING SUGGESTION RIGHT NOW***

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:04 YES
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:07 i was thinking about that
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:13 low-poly terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:25 low poly would be interesting
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:30 YES
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:34 that would be pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:40 as long as there was variety
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:23:57 <@!308156968550268928> no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:17 that would look extremely weird
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:18 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:19 bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:22 no

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:39 nerd
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:24:48 it's outdated

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:27:18 uh no
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:27:20 no terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:27:25 no roblox terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:27:50 rick did you read my suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:27:57 low poly? ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:28:07 yeah roblox terrain is nice but not when you need this much
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:28:52 that would look shit +orange
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:29:28 i would be happy if the current map was polished a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:29:37 hold on lemme load some examples
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:36 this part needs filling in
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:37 it looks weird
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:32:00 this needs to either screw off or be relocated
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:19 i'm doing this in a public server btw
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:00 what is this
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:13 big gap in water
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:29 moon area needs more detail
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:02 needs to be a river for more interesting screenshots, possibility for bridges and riverside creations
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:22 somewhere around here
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:33 the whole map also needs more details like trees
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:43 oh for goodness sake
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:45 he disappeared
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:36:48 typical rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:48:51 alright you know what
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:00 ima go onto public servers and flex my starship
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:22 no noob
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:24 the purple one is WIP
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:32 i paint everything purple when building
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:38 i started painting it
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:49:40 same colour scheme
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:51:01 this is the 'purple' one
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:51:10 
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:51:31 cliff + beach would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:51:39 but imo moon area should be kept
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:51:47 perhaps relocated
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:53:29 the glory of public servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:53:36 
creations-chat 2019-09-06 20:55:36 ok that looks pretty decent

general 2019-09-06 21:52:39 i was trying to get into a new game overhaul for factorio but i was like 'what the fuck is this' upon seeing the insane microcrafting and resource management
general 2019-09-06 21:53:03 and gave up within an hour
general 2019-09-06 21:53:27 which might sound like a fair bit of time but i had about 6 furnaces + miners going at that point

bug-reports 2019-09-08 12:42:21 to me it looks like you're just going so fast that drag slows the compartment down and it struggles against the aircraft
bug-reports 2019-09-08 12:43:06 i would suggest going slower and maybe using rotating cylinders or something like that against the walls of the cabin to allow it to move with minimal friction

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 21:29:44 it's likely the channel was deleted at some point
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 21:30:10 but i remember explicitly pinging him to ask if I could share the game file, his response was something like 'To be honest I'd prefer if you didn't'

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:06:15 my class is a bit of a mess atm, so i'm thankful our year halves are being mixed
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:06:51 that sort of shit wouldn't happen to anyone round here lol

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:08:36 well, mostly just lower-than-average intelligence but at least no one's agressive... other classes in my year have people who will punch anyone for fun. guessing you can relate

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:16:26 actually in theory that could be true but there are probably like 10 servers for people talking behind people's backs

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:20:14 sounds like a central problem tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:21:52 that's always a shit idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:22:55 i just spend my whole lunch in the library(yes, we have a library... pretty big school tbh) because all my friends are nerds. our school doesn't allow phones at all
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:23:16 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:23:33 the reason they're not banned yet is because of politics and organized crime
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:24:29 the arms industry is utterly evil tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:24:46 people benefit off killing people, basically
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:25:15 yeah fossil fuels are... dodgy
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:25:20 lots of corruption
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:26:35 once fusion energy is commercialized though...
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:26:43 they will have no bloody chance lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:26:59 the first to commercialize fusion is going to make INSANE amounts of money
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:27:20 they will be able to produce MASSIVE amounts of energy and sell it for extremely cheap prices
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:27:24 no one will be able to compete
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:27:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:27:50 aw
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:27:55 bye, gl with school
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:28:33 there are several companies doing things like that but it's not enough
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:28:54 if we can cut energy usage though, huge amounts of pollution would be reduced
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:28:57 ie, fusion
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:29:04 fusion is basically our saviour
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:29:41 delete
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:29:55 the problem is
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:30:17 people aren't just gonna stop, uh, you know, just for the sake of reducing population
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:32:14 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:38:08 and likely not as of ever
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:38:18 the game is hardcoded
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:38:28 stuff being changed means other stuff breaks
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:38:35 mad did a shitty job coding it basically
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:38:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:39:05 hold on what

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:34:48 youtube tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:34:54 are the death of this game
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:35:16 people copy block-to-block without even trying to understand how it works, show it off and leave
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:35:46 i don't mean literally killing the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:36:06 i just mean they really degrade the playerbase's creativity and knowledge
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:36:50 DOOR
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:37:01 yo has anyone tried formation flight with the new motors yet?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:39:47 huh?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 17:39:52 how does that work?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:03:12 whaa-
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:03:19 there's a chaneglog now?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:03:44 i was going to fix it but
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:03:46 why bother
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:04:29 so, i apologize for the huge discomfort my pressing of two buttons in the wrong order is causing you
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:04:36 i hope i can be forgiven
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:36:48 how do options with two possible outputs need two letters? -.-
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:37:02 just store as 1-0 or smth
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:37:07 or?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:37:17 listening
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:37:44 wait, you can't modify the saving system?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:00 what's the problem then? just curious
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:18 i
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:19 i see
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:38 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:43 i might have a suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:50 on how to decrease colour data cost
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:53 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:08 are you sure?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:10 how's it saved?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:17 per every block?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:28 so each block has its own colouring?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:42 i might have suggested this before
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:17 but why not pre-load/save every colour on the creation to a datastore instead of for every block, then colour all the blocks like that, just saving which of the *saved* colours is on that block?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:31 so like, say I have black and red on a creation
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:42 when I save, the game will give every red block a value of 0
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:47 and every black block a value of 1
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:52 and save that as a colour value
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:57 well, not colour value
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:40:58 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:41:02 not binary
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:41:04 but as data for that block
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:41:22 then, it would also save the red and black colour values
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:41:26 and save it to a datastore
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:41:48 and attribute those values '1' to black and '0' to red
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:01 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:36 then, when the creation was loaded, it would only need to load that '0' means red and '1' means black
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:48 ah, ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:43:08 why did mad hardcode this >,<
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:43:17 sure, it's supposed to be a demo
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:43:26 but he spent a full **4 months** on the game engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:43:33 why spend that long on a demo?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:43:34 yeah

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 20:48:00 actually i might do just 3 options
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 20:48:19 yeah probs just going to do 3 so we don't run dry on ideas
contest-info 2019-09-10 20:50:38 **CONTEST POLL**
1⃣ Alien builds (not from Earth but shaped by *some* sort of intelligence)
2⃣ Ocean themed *static* builds (lighthouse, islands, buoy, underwater base, seafloor radar station, etc)
3⃣ Satellites (unmanned probes that look like they belong in space)

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:13:40 i've seen **hundreds** make planes... let's not have a plane contest ever then, hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:13:55 10 people doesn't really compare that much
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:14:00 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:14:49 voxel said no
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:15:05 because '''tOo mANY chanNels'''
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:15:53 yeah well, the mods tried to convince him but he basically ignored them

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:11 vix's submissions
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:21 yes i thought you'd say that
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:27 tell me when you have ideas.
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:40 and mrepic's images because yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:41 
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:17:51 that comes under 'static ocean themed objects'
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:18:30 the problem is that make it too generic and people will just submit all pre-built stuff, make it too imaginative and people just won't build anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:12 what is
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:26 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:27 it really
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:29 really
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:30 is not
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:40 it's about encouraging people to build new things
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:48 and trying to give ideas and inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:56 it's not literally drop and drag from your image folder
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:19:59 and forget about it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:20:33 yeah, imagination decreases as you get older
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:20:40 ok that's your opinion
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:20:55 i partially agree but curious to see what original builds will be submitted
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:21:05 (--if any)
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:21:14 (--but that's with most contests)

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:22:32 like you seem to think
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 21:23:12 that's with almost all contests apart from a few select ones

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:28:05 how much power the motor can apply
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:28:17 a higher torque motor = the more the motor can carry
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:28:20 uh idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:28:26 voxel randomly announces them
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:28:43 that meme is dead btw
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:29:10 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:31:58 i have no idea what on earth is going on with that role
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:32:09 voxel one day did a vote in modchat to remove confirmation
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:32:27 then for some reason went around changing permissions for the i read rules role instead of just deleting it..
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:33:37 i don't think he's corrupt in that sense but imo he's really not the best owner
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:45:17 do you mean *unofficial feature*?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:45:35 well maybe
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:46:34 devs are converting all energy units into heat?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:46:56 the management team is shit though
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:47:02 the code must be so hard to edit
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:47:41 they keep pushing out updates wayyy too fast, either they have a massive dev team or they're pushing badly documented releases with tons of technical depth
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:49:12 yeah humans are super OP
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:49:38 also their brain simulating engine needs to be updated, like wtf is on with this whole anti-vaxxer shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:49:46 glitch should be fixed
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:50:15 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:50:39 remember when dinosaurs got too OP so they nuked them?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:50:52 pretty radical solution imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:51:44 it's possible the devs abandoned this version
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:51:52 to move on to another better game engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:51:57 because this one is pretty bad

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 18:13:08 not guided?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 18:13:19 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 18:13:22 so it *is* guided
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 18:13:48 ballistic missiles are launched directly on a course to their target with minimal guidance
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 18:14:42 i keep trying to think of some way to build a mechanical rangefinder

An expert in astrowarfare has written an article we would like to feature in our regular broadcasts.

In most old movies and vids, space warfare is seen as fast, exciting and close-range. This couldn't be further from the truth. People familiar with orbital mechanics will understand where I'm going with this.

The truth is, nothing in space ever stops. Everything is always orbiting some sort of gravity well. This is radically different from warfare with the land and subsurface vehicles we have developed and use on-world. It means that everything has to be planned months, sometimes even years ahead, and the endless number of manoeuvres possible turns any kind of astrowarfare into a massive chess game. Everything lies in predicting your opponent's  moves, and figuring out the most efficient and unpredictable way to counter them. 

Often, the first stages of a war will have almost no immediate combat, depending on where in space the two side's fleets are positioned. Orbits are constantly adjusted to send ships to intercept other fleets or strike important targets or otherwise.

The slow-moving ballistic and unrealistic 'lasers' (which aren't lasers) also portrayed in movies and vids are complete nonsense. In space, combat takes place at thousands or even millions of miles apart. The only way to send a sufficiently fast projectile with minimal detection chance is through a proper, speed-of-light laser. 

Deployment and firing of lasers is an interesting topic. Firing a laser at a long distance means the enemy is able to detect and avoid the pulse if their ship is fast enough, but also means close combat can be avoided - meaning much less damage to your ship. Firing at close range means that it's unlikely the enemy ship will be able to dodge, but wait too long and the enemy will destroy you before you fire a shot.

general 2019-09-11 19:21:16 Lasers are targeted by extremely precise number-crunching software. However, computers are still at a primitive stage and accurate targeting takes a very long time to compute, so often it's better to engage at close range... however, 'sniper' ships do exist with very powerful computer technology specifically for the purpose of destroying big things at long ranges.

Lasers also disperse with distance - some more expensive and more concentrated lasers can go a very long way but in turn require powerful computing to target. Primitive lasers can only target quite close and are better off on small ships.

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:50:01 what it was like
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:50:15 also the last two mod applications have had 0 results
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:50:42 the one before the last, we had one guy join and he immediately stated he would be inactive and basically asked for a demotion
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:51:00 the last one i can't even remember actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:51:06 did it?

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:52:08 imperial just
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:52:21 got moderator on another server and decided it was better than this one
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:52:38 which i suppose has some truth in it, even not knowing what server it is..

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:53:53 don't make me pull out my power card: the first horseman of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:54:25 the second horseman of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:54:41 the third horseman of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:54:46 fourth is still open position

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:56:09 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:56:29 the toxicity of this server... lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:56:34 it's much better now
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:56:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:56:57 but still a large improvement
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:57:22 and yes, one of the main problems is most people on here are 13-17 years old
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:57:31 it's a fairly young community
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:57:48 go to factorio or something like that and you'll find an ultra-peaceful server
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:57:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 20:58:04 roblox servers are always going to be... horrible

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:04:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:04:36 most people who vote don't actually build anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:04:52 wait, voxel
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:05:19 can I change <#504718138399522832> and <#609381270237216768>  so only contest-role people can see it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:05:24 might need some discussion
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:05:46 yah no worries most people's stuff looks bad at first
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:05:56 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:06:25 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:06:56 voxel respond -.-
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:07:33 what do you suggest then
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:07:49 give me a few topic that are not 'stupid' then
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:08:20 no, give me something that i can use
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:08:40 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:09:08 amphibious vehicles people would basically submit tanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:09:20 replication contests?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:09:24 have you lost your fucking mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:09:42 people build enough of the same bullshit all the time as it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:05 if you think i'm going to encourage replication, you are WRONG.
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:10 lilundr
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:16 ok let's see then
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:19 UAV's
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:40 wouldn't work because people would load in their military aircraft, change a couple of things and submit them
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:10:54 or just clone stuff that looks the same off google images
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:11:17 ok i no longer respect your opinion
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:11:32 but i don't respect your opinion so i don't care
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:12:02 contest topics will hopefully improve next week, i admit that satellites was a shitty topic but i couldn't think of much else
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:12:30 ideas:
1) interplanetary motherships (anything that looks like it should travel between planets)
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:12:37 2) hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:06 no one else had a problem with that
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:09 i mean no one
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:16 literally 0 people
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:22 except for you
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:39 there are just 2 there and I feel like it's an underbuilt style
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:13:53 pccgcs?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:14:55 wait. i'm not in your shitty invite-only group(i assume that's what it is) for your friends because i choose bad contest topics in your opinion?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:15:14 well?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:15:29 yes, vip and me don't have a particularly good relationship
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:15:34 i'm not surprised
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:16:22 turbo and i have grudges too. mostly because i try to encourage creativity
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:16:30 while he loves copying off google images.
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:17:26 i'm sorry, but i'm not going to encourage replication because about 3 people (you, vip and turbo) don't like creativity. screw off.
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:17:32 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:17:36 yes pizzas?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:17:39 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:17:51 send screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:18:06 alright. gonna take it that I won that argument
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:18:59 my biggest tip would be to try and detail it as much as possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:19:04 with wedges and cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:19:11 lemme
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:19:29 like this
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:19:30 rather than making it flat
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:19:40 flat surfaces are often your enemy in building
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:20:17 lilundr i'm sorry but
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:20:20 hold on a mo
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:20:42 yes not good with colouring
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:03 this is a better example i suppose
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:04 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:12 lots of detailing
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:17 lilundr don't say a bloody word
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:31 drone runway
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:21:55 vtol-drones
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:22:03 i reckon he was before tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:22:43 honestly i was kind of envious about your PCCGSS or whatever it was server thing, but then I found out it was run by vipempire
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:23:53 hold on what
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:24:25 i was just looking through my screenshots and suddenly the chat starts being spammed
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:25:08 question, any of you got ideas for next contest?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:26:12 i actually did do futuristic bombers at one point but it wasn't voted for
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:26:24 already done...
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:26:54 idk when but
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:26:55 this won
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:28:12 was also done i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:28:33 one of these one
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:28:39 would look practically the same tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:30:25 1) blimps... all look the same
2) possibly
3) too broad tbh, would need narrowing down
4) would also look all the same
5) yes, possibly, good idea
6) was voted down literally last contest poll
7) was also voted down last poll
8) **was also voted down last poll**
9) inventor vehicles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:30:46 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:30:58 ..
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:31:15 possibly, but tbh we already have a rank for that
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:31:24 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:31:44 whatever looks best... try it, if it doesn't look good just remove it
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:04 oh, but yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:09 you haven't seen modchat xD
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:26 we get large numbers of nonsense with requests for inventors all the time
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:33 about 1/10 submissions is inventor worthy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:39 it would be a mess tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:32:41 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:33:18 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:33:42 ok yeah those would all look the same too
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:33:47 unless you were really into guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:33:55 no u
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:34:03 you can't even think of one contest idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:34:16 not a good one anyways. and you're the only one complaining
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:34:22 well, not on this topic actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:34:25 no i don't
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:34:41 motor shrine
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:35:32 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:35:56 the motor had its age
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:35:57 😦
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:36:08 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:36:22 yes, it's been a few contests since industrial builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:36:32 but ngl, people would probably submit tons of chernobyl builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:36:46 that was a pretty good contest tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:02 YO
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:04 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:07 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:20 i don't know tbh. we wouldn't get too many submissions...
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:29 plus, how would this work? magnets weld weirdly
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:40 yes it's an interesting idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:37:53 someone suggested minigames too
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:38:15 huh, true
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:38:43 yeah, this is harder than people think
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:39:15 oh you know what was REALLY good though
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:39:16 this shit is amazing
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:40:03 i was thinking about that but people have a lot of pre-built mechs and not many actually do them anymore
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:41:15 it's really nice imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:41:18 a great idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:41:53 don't think many people would be interested in that either
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:42:08 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:43:07 tbh it's either do 'generic fighter jets' and everyone submits their F15 and is happy or 'some crazy weird shit' and people get annoyed at me for bad contest ideas but the submissions are more interesting
creations-chat 2019-09-11 21:47:04 or build your own
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:47:43 well, we just had a couple of towns submitted for this contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:49:37 idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:49:42 mod team has to vote on it..
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:50:35 ..
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:50:49 brickzay i got one upvote from vipempire
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 21:50:59 this confirms me as top builder
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 22:11:13 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 22:11:15 NO
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 22:11:23 i don't

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:07:27 known for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:07:33 physics are broken
creations-chat 2019-09-12 16:38:43 ok that's actually fairly nice
creations-chat 2019-09-12 16:38:53 I messed around with those systems in the past but never got anything much going
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:19 UK
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:34 TEA!!?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:42 yeah ik

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:04:04 me too tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:04:17 crumpets are some propaganda bullshit 😠
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:04:35 WALK ON THE LEFT TO AVOID CAUSING CONGESTION
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:05:51 evolve

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:07:06 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:07:08 that sounds bad

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:11:36 literal z
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:11:55 i'm a python guy :>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:39 i was testing a placement engine for sandbox games in ICT(we were supposed to be doing excel) when the teacher came up to me and was like 'what are you doing'
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:44 in python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:49 lua bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:53 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:09 badly optimised for a start
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:18 yeah structuring is pretty confusing at times
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:31 it's just... less flexible. stuff doesn't run as quickly
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:39 because you don't know python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:55 it would take me 5 years on lua
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:58 5 days on python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:10 to make a decent script
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:33 see? that's my point.. we have different strengths
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:36 TKINTER
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:38 FOR THE WIN
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:45 window class
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:56 for making windows and editing widgets in them
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:04 AMAZINGLY simple, fairly flexible
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:32 python = great
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:52 number python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:03 for variable management, i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:07 lists and tuples n shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:11 correct me if i'm wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:27 tkinter tkinter tkinter
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:31 also
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:50 with python you actually have a PROPER random number library 😤
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:18:09 from random import randint

i = randint(1, 10)
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:18:52 python is also very powerful... it's not as complex or as well optimized as java but you can still do a lot of stuff with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:19:00 entire apps coded in python exist
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:19:06 nop
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:19:46 and not lua
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:19:51 😤 😤 😤
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:20:01 they have I think
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:20:13 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:20:31 but if roblox had done their API for *python*...
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:20:53 it's also very simple... mod team have to vote, and from experience i'll say they won't vote for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:20:59 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:21:06 roblox API
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:21:07 for lua
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:21:09 like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:21:18 all the stuff roblox coded into libraries
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:21:26 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:22:30 Application programming Interface
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:23:20 oh yeahhh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:23:21 nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:24:22 fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:24:58 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:25:32 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:25:33 ok fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:25:34 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:26:13 for?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:26:21 huh?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:26:26 what does it do
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:28:04 but... why not just invert the way the motor faces?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:33:44 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:58 yo wtf
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:54:02 it's well founded
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:21:51 in *theory* it should be but it wouldn't be easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:22:29 any number of methods
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:22:33 whatever you could think of
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:38:16 😠
general 2019-09-12 18:41:02 finkl why
general 2019-09-12 18:42:39 i'll start this again then
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:42:45 ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:43:02 oh the arrestor cable thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:43:09 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:43:23 too simple and build before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:43:59 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:44:03 the FFF
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:23 it doesn't even matter if it was built before - it's just too simple
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:40 but there's no easy way to find it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:45 it's fairly obvious to build, it's literally 2 ropes and a ring, and it's not about simplicity
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:04 no it's not
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:10 it's too simple
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:22 we won't give inventor out to people who put a ring on two ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:42 it's supposed to be a difficult to attain role, you have to *think for it!!*
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:17 it should be obvious..
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:28 alright you know what, i have better things to do
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:50:20 lol
general 2019-09-12 18:51:16 
general 2019-09-12 18:53:25 
general 2019-09-12 18:58:14 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:58:30 it's not that bad for a beginner tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:13 *if* he is a beginner, then
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:56 why do you play on public servers? lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:09 ok ngl that's a good reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:20 drop it. it isn't inventor worthy. it's literally a ring and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:57 IT'S SIMPLE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:00 as heck
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:37 ^
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:06:48 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:02 no inventor for ring on ropes which is a modified arrestor cable and has been built before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:03 aha
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:06 our overlord speaks
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:12 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:14 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:22 rick why
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:39 ok i give up you won't accept defeat
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:08:05 fonkl just shush he's not going to stfu
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:24 now SHUSH!
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:35 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:38 i have no words
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:14 i can't remember the last time someone even got inventor for suspension...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:38 this is bullshit.
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:11 alright
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:13 you know what?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:38 let's give everyone who builds a magnet engine by splitting their creation in half with suspension inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:42 sure it's a magnet engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:47 but it's done a different way
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:19 it's TWO ROPES AND A RING
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:35 it has about 1/5 the components of the suspension you keep talking about
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:58 this HAS BEEN SEEN BEFORE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:15 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/621784410186055771/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:35 REPLACING A BEAM WITH A RING WILL NOT GET YOU INVENTOR
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:16 yes, i asked voxel to
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:20 he hasn't responded
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:22 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:28 hissy fit?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:34 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:15:11 well, trying to get the mods to vote on it so I can deny it but most are offline
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:34 oh lord here comes another argument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:30 why is this still a fucking thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:56 PROBLEM. SOLVED.
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:05 we deleted the rank from <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:43 it can, but you can't ask for it, at least not if you're inactive
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:04 fuc
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:20 ^^
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:03 yeah we should have that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:58 <#544722974574379021>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:59 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:16 that's already what it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:31 but it could lead to bias so tbh i think it should be limited to mods
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:35 OK!
let's remove all ranks!
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:42 that way everyone is equ-
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:44 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:50 WE MUST ESTABLISH EQUALITY
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:55 no ranks anymore!!
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:59 yes.
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:08 yeah the server where you talk behind our backs instead of coming to us with the problems, trashtalk mods from leaked modchat screenshots and is a literal toxicity generator
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:30 read above
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:58 no, i mean that they used it mostly for trashtalking
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:44:07 the screenshots i posted were just a few
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:20 yep, there were some of those conversations. but most of it was just trashtalking people
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:28 yes. why would i promote something everyone already does?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:31 hmm?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:47:03 the satellite contest allows replications and also creativity
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:47:12 sure, the topic isn't great
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:47:29 but i couldn't think of anything else and neither could anyone i asked
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:47:44 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:47:52 talking behind our backs won't solve anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:49:01 already asked the 3 main people involved if they have better ideas
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:49:15 why not just have contests
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:49:22 where people can submit both?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:09 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:27 military jets will NOT be a topic lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:36 already done
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:51:23 tbh i wouldn't want to alternate them... i would want them running in parallel
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:51:41 but voxel doesn't want more channels, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:51:44 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:17 i just wouldn't want to force one or the other every week
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:25 finally, some support!
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:35 actually no i had a couple other people praise it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:49 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:12 i'm thinking about it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:44 i think we might want to completely overhaul the contest systems
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:54 but i don't know how
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:57 yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:59 would be good
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:54:05 but not too many contests at once
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:54:13 participants would be spread too thin
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:54:46 😌
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:01 what i think we should do
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:15 i have somewhere where people can submit their ideas for contest themes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:26 then mods filter out some of the best ones
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:31 and the remaining ones are randomised
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:40 how would that work, though?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:46 i was considering that but
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:55:55 i don't know if people would actually bother to join..
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:56:21 alright, so create a server and try all these ideas out
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:56:40 alrighty
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:31:14 https://imgur.com/a/rLYzMMm
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:31:32 it's an album
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:31:35 look through all of it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:39:41 why would I?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:39:51 sure, that was there too, but largely trashtalking
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:40:31 you could have suggested themes for next contest instead of creating a private server to talk behind my back..
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:40:52 just asked infact
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:41:26 ended up being mostly for trashtalking, and yes, discussion between you and vip, occasionally others
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:41:44 turbo
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:41:52 do you have any suggestions for next contest?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:43:01 you know, we want to do something similar to this
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:43:47 screwed up the names...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:43:49 that's better
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:44:03 not that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:44:42 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:44:52 there...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:45:20 turbo, if you don't like the current contests, at least try and help me improve them
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 20:45:55 ah. i see
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 21:59:39 we're discussing that rn
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:00:05 voxel, i'm assuming you saw the.. thing with the PCCGC server?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:01:09 I'm also assuming that it doesn't matter much about the leaked modchat images?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:07:32 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:07:43 I closed the contest early
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:07:59 because there were no more submissions and everyone wanted it closed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:09:38 you know what? fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:09:43 you can run the contests
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:09:59 you've made it clear enough you think they're shit, if by doing it behind my back
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:10:15 your problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:37:10 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:38:23 I told you, I'm not doing contests any more
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:39:04 Actually nvm voxel deleted that message
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:08:19 stepped down from the admin team, 👋 cya everyone
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:08:37 yielding, i was thinking about it for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:08:45 yesterday was just the tipping point. it's not just that
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:13:20 Uh, quick spoiler
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:13:26 contests might not be hosted any more
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:13:47 
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:13:51 no one has responded so far
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:14:01 and voxel claims he has no time for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:14:15 take it to voxel
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:16:26 i was hosting them until yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:16:38 yeah, going to move on to a more mature server if I can
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:16:57 i know
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:17:49 tbh, I was part of a couple of discord servers for minecraft and I must say they were infinitely more mature than this..
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:18:24 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:19:21 actually that's true. they tend to be a lot more game-orientated..
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:20:06 yes. but some communities are much more mature than this... even some of those with 5yos
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:21:19 i was going to but I think it's against the rules to share the discord with anyone out of it...
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:21:23 the others i'm not part of anymore
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:21:29 just moved on, servers got stale
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:21:45 thanks yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:22:10 uh
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:22:19 jesus, mod team is dying
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:22:36 i think he may have left over the shitshow yesterday......
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:22:45 no one was too happy about that
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:23:14 he said that he was considering stepping down anyways, tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:23:36 well, blackbird... you'll have to take that up with him
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:23:45 he left the server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:23:50 just now
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:23:57 after i posted my message of resignation
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:24:07 oh. rejoined then
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:24:58 yes it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:25:05 i'm glad i won't have to handle it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:26:07 i wonder who's next
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:26:36 discord is going to shit but the game is active
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:26:39 to say the least
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:26:48 yes but about 99% are inactive
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:27:11 99
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:27:39 technically rickje does own the server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:27:57 voxel was basically blackmailed into transferring ownership to rickje a few months ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:28:30 rick, dark kayn and me have left the mod team
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:28:40 well, still waiting for voxel to remove my rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:28:45 mostly over the shitshow yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:28:54 well, not mostly
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:29:05 i was considering leaving before but that was the tipping point
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:30:17 well, long story short someone leaked an invite to a server where turbo, vip, lilundr, kayn and purified(some other people but they didn't talk that much) were trash talking me and sometimes orangekii. server was a huge slew of toxicity, tried to talk with them and it didn't end too well
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:30:35 a lot more happened than that but i've done enough typing today ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:30:58 rick, i'm sorry but i'm done here and i don't think you can convince me to go back
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:31:02 i'm not talking about voxel ;p
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:31:06 well, these guys are..
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:32:35 ownership is on rickje
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:32:47 voxel has only slightly more power than admins now
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:32:54 this was a long time ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:08 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:10 he doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:14 he transferred ownership
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:24 that's just a role
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:48 tbh i don't like voxel, but not for that reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:33:54 afk
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:40:09 hello lilundr.
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:48:59 relatable
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:50:25 why would I show you having conversations about building a ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:50:47 of course i do
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:50:56 do you expect anything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:52:01 wouldn't work like that. server is for roblox, this is pretty much what we should expect
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:55:27 me too. because you know what? if you have any better fucking ideas, I want to hear them
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:57:07 are you on the receiving side of 5 people on a private server who basically spam shit about my contests instead of coming up to me with a better idea?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:57:16 do you know how it *feels*?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:58:09 it doesn't matter either way, I reckon. I stepped down from the admin team earlier today(not just because of this)
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:59:29 what would you have said? 'it's a server where they discuss cool ideas and building, but they also sometimes trashtalk me?'
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:59:47 you're arguing against bias. and I'm sorry but it's impossible not to be biased
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:02:20 i tried condensing the rules a bit at some point but voxel refused to implement them. no idea why
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:03:03 
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:04:12 you know what? no u
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:04:48 fairly sure that you would also be biased if you discovered a whole server where a bunch of people were talking behind your back about how much you dislike the contests
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:05:21 that's bullshit
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:05:45 and if you wanted to basically describe your server, would you post screenshots of you trashtalking me or of discussions about building?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:06:29 so that's your argument now
help 2019-09-13 16:18:45 needs more lift to the sides
help 2019-09-13 16:18:54 lift to the sides stabilise the plane left to right
help 2019-09-13 16:20:32 wings
help 2019-09-13 16:20:36 just, any
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:33:35 needs more detail, less flat surfaces and more colour variation imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:33:39 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:34:20 oh... ok, i guess that's fair enough 🤷
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:42:48 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:42:49 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:45:22 🤷
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:50:02 you can tell by looking at the roles
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:50:25 yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:50:47 well, there we have it. it was fun.
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:50:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:50:59 i stepped down
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:51:06 holy shit this feels weird
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:51:31 the shitshow yesterday was the tipping point, but the community just seems immature and toxic and I don't know what I can do about it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:51:35 and feel like i should move on
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:52:12 i'm not running contests. i decided that before deciding to step down
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:52:32 voxel can't find any hosts. i told him it was his problem and i wasn't putting up with this crap anymore
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:12 i can't see the archives any more
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:16 this is weird
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:42 and kayn too
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:45 and imperial
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:54 he just left
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:53:57 after the shitshow
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:54:46 i stepped down from admin
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:55:23 community is immature and toxic, at least for the most part in my definition. tipping point was yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:57:19 i keep scrolling down to modchat ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:58:34 yep
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 16:59:34 yo ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:01:02 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:01:13 why am i moderator
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:01:50 no toxicity
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:01:51 GOT IT?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:02:44 -.-
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:03:40 speaking of outdated
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:03:42 thoughts on this?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:03:47 typed it up a while back
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:03:57 but voxel didn't really do too much with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:06:15 fun fact: I was warned within one month twice
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:06:29 but i deleted the modlogs <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:06:59 ?modlogs 260797229068058634
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:07:04 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:08:55 just realised something
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:09:26 turbo and vip will keep to their private server now since they've closed all invite links so no one can get in c;
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:09:38 alright. i'm happy with that.
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:11:51 fonkl...

plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:51:10 
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:51:28 a general vote was taken
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:51:34 i stepped down
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:51:44 i wanted to step down completely due to the shitshow yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:51:46 among other things
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:52:07 fonkl convinced me to remain as moderator
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:52:18 maybe ask for admin again once things calm down

the-dump 2019-09-25 00:27:41 
the-dump 2019-09-25 00:29:18 And the next half a minute is just a rant about how there was bad timing for him with the buses in his tiny little home town

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 00:56:19 Yes
the-dump 2019-09-25 00:57:36 I think so
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:03:44 It's better than most the shit that gets posted here
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:04:00 Mostly because it's actually detailed in some way or another
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:04:20 Damping is bounciness/reactivity to bouncing
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:04:49 Idk lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:05:24 First looks more organized and elegant actually tbh
the-dump 2019-09-25 01:07:23 Uhm ok

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:47:16 personally i favour original creations because it takes more effort to build them... will upvote an original creation more easily than a replication ;/
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:47:41 yah

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 20:25:24 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 20:28:11 ok so i built this
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 20:28:33 the catch?
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 20:28:59 oh yeah

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:11:13 fucking brilliant, roblox crashed AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:11:25 what a fantastically optimized application
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:13:38 it's not in audit logs ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:14:02 <@!409432499584761857> post it here
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:14:59 finkl
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:15:17 -.- what would be the practical application of that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:15:45 ok, but before that we need logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:16:31 ILS, tracking computer, navigation, autonomous drones, pvp vehicles, radar, processors, calculators, altitude adjusters, autopilots, computer-like analytical ingame tools
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:16:34 all of this we can do
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:16:38 WITH LOGIC GATES.
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:16:49 and it just sinks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:17:09 let's bully rick so he makes logic gate
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:17:21 let's go
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:17:41 logic gates would work on *input* and *processing* blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:17:54 input blocks would be sensors basically and could detect information from a list
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:18:00 a list of things to detect
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:18:15 then processing blocks would be either simple logic gates or a computer-like block
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:18:25 which could take input from input blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:18:32 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:18:51 then they could be linked to output blocks: eg, motors/pistons/engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:00 logic blocks wouldn't be cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:03 they would be the best addition
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:06 ever
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:06 possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:12 noc
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:20 ILS, tracking computer, navigation, autonomous drones, pvp vehicles, radar, processors, calculators, altitude adjusters, autopilots, computer-like analytical ingame tools
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:37 suspension adjusters, trim adapters, submarine controllers
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:43 aaa
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:51 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:19:59 not to the same simplicity
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:20:19 you would need a shit ton of blocks and commands in minecraft to do most of that so screw off
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 21:20:31 in plane crazy it would be so fucking great

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:51:38 they've been developing like 4 years
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:52:26 astrocraft is pretty good but i keep finding a HUGE plethora of mildly annoying f3x bugs
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:52:56 i wasn't -.-
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:54:16 apart from randomly disappearing parts, random immobilisation, needing to look at the ground to move a part, not being able to rotate upon the Y axis, R/T rotation axis not working properly especially with wedges, you mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:54:36 f3x is powerful but some parts are just... ew
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:15 here's some random lore i wrote a while back

Drether is an aircraft and spacecraft design firm, specialising in applying new technology and concepts to its craft. Most of its builds are completely original rather than following the standard formula for what vehicles should look like, resulting in quite a signature look.
The company was started in 2044 following the failure of fusion power and invention of efficient atmospheric rocket thrusters. The first aircraft were attempts to build fast, nimble VTOLs capable of fast personnel transport. After several successful designs, efforts were moved to larger, more powerful cargo VTOLs designed for flying to remote locations. These VTOLs were ordered by several large companies, and turned out to be a large success.
Since then, focus has moved to creating original designs and practical craft. More focus has also been put into designing SSTOs as the concept turned out to be highly successful following multiple launches(and landings) by high-profile companies. The reusability of the craft also work in favour of Drether, and in 2057 an orbital shipyard was constructed with these SSTOs for their own purposes.
Inventions of new technology have also proven useful in innovation efforts. In 2054, a scientist working for a magnet group discovered a way to create motion of a structure using a magnet on the same structure, something previously thought to break the laws of physics. The setup, however, required a huge amount of power, meaning it was almost useless. Despite this, scientists at Drether's space division saw the potential in a spacecraft using this technology, and within just a few months spacecraft were flying powered by only solar energy.
_ _
_ _
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:26 The concept was heavily criticized, being called 'a less powerful form of ion' by a number of research groups, but major breakthroughs in the technology surrounding this concept were made in 2055. Commercialisation of the technique was now in sight, and the first magnet-powered VTOL was created just 5 months later. The VTOL was a very small design capable of transporting light cargo and nothing more, and could only fly for under an hour without recharging. Technology continued to improve and the first human carrying magnet VTOL was released in 2057.
Major drawbacks, however, were reached following the crash of three magnet VTOLs over civilian areas within the same month. Several weeks of investigation followed and it was discovered that a specific frequency of radio signal that had recently come into use for the purposes of different experiments in propulsion technology could intervene with the delicate technology that channelled the power created by the magnets. Not wanting to halt research on new propulsion, a mass recall of the craft followed, and large and costly changes were made to the channelling system.
_ _
_ _
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:39 Efforts started moving toward building larger craft. By now, transporting goods was incredibly cheap, easy and with no environmental cost thanks to magnet technology combined with solar. Some of the largest craft ever built were released the following year, most notably its record breaking 300-metre long and 40 metre wide flying fortress. An enormous  flying aircraft carrier was also built, and despite not being the first made headlines around the world thanks to its size, efficiency and capacity.
Development was also coming to the point where a craft could stay in the air indefinitely using solar technology without recharging. At this point Drether's best ships were in the air for a maximum of 54 hours before recharging, presenting new options for survey, explorative, scientific and unfortunately military operations.
_ _
_ _
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:54 Inevitably, external companies had been arming their magnetic drones since the very beginning of the technology, but this had been mostly irrelevant. Earth was in its most peaceful period since the dawn of human history. 

Until now.
_ _
_ _
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:03:05 September, late 2060. Militaries around the world know the potential of the craft in warfare, and by now they are commonplace in armies. Cheap scouting drones, dogfighting craft, transport ships, huge black bombers looming menacingly over objects in proximity. Even a few massive flying carriers rested with some militaries. Some odd weapons too, like mobile artillery cannons and kamikaze drones.
_ _ 
_ _
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:03:17 None of this really helped the pacifists when war broke out. There were no long tensions, either. And the cause was quite simple: human error. The code behind one of the autopilot drone systems caused it to switch to autonomous after not receiving any signals for a length of time. Turns out it's quite a bad idea to have this installed on a UN heavy bomber that was routed, for some reason, over a major Asian city while away on a training exercise. The  automatic targeting system, which was usually extremely reliable, started firing bombs at a false positive. At this point, I'm going to remind you the massive destructive potential the bombers possessed. They could carry a huge amount of high-explosive bombs, totalling to damage equivalent to about half the Hiroshima blast. A total of about 30,000 casualties was estimated, and the bomber didn't even drop its full arsenal. Asia, not knowing it had been a malfunction took it as a declaration of war and refused negotiations from the UN.

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:15:15 fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:15:28 ok now the dump please
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:24:39 it's pretty brave of her to go and do that but the presentation was shit tbh
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:25:59 main problem with climate change is dirty industrial practice and shipping, people keep telling you to 'walk to school' n shit but to be honest it's not going to make a huge difference even if everyone does it. it's the industries that need to improve
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:28:23 also i find it confusing that everyone she was ranting at was clapping???
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:35:57 oh my god yes lmao
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:36:20 i don't understand people who buy bottled water... i just don't get the fucking point
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:37:18 why spend £1.50 for a tiny ugly bottle that gets warm in about 5 minutes of mild sun every day instead of literally turning a knob while holding a £10 re-usable bottle under it
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:37:22 just like what the fuck
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:38:50 nah plastic production is *extremely* cheap
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:39:02 in terms of both carbon and economy
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:39:26 it's more the massive environmental problems with oil and plastic tbh
the-dump 2019-09-26 18:39:57 ...

creations-chat 2019-09-28 15:29:38 on my way to b0mb the airport
creations-chat 2019-09-28 15:33:50 yes, you somewhat have to sacrifice looks when strapping 6 3x3 missiles onto this tiny thing and then trying to balance centre of mass/lift to stop the plane going insane when you fire

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:35:09 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:36:00 Because i feel it would be better to make people actually build something to get their creation up there... It would just make the game pointlessly easier
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:36:23 <@210141202698338304>
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:44 Some people don't like the annoyance of building
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:38:05 I wouldn't call it quality of life tbh, it just removes one of the challenges
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:15 Your plans isn't MEANT to need to get to the edge of the baseplate to take off btw
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:51 But you can do that without an air spawn, it's just harder to do it. That's my point
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:05 Alright whatever I don't want to argue rn because I'm on tabket
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:38 Ok sorry but that's bullshit. A game without difficulty is not fun
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:49 Alright bye

help 2019-09-29 12:08:28 imagine you have a stick, which you push on one end
help 2019-09-29 12:08:45 O---------- like that, - being the stick, O being the force pushing on it
help 2019-09-29 12:09:00 now, you want to stop the stick spinning when you push it
help 2019-09-29 12:09:05 so you apply force on the other end
help 2019-09-29 12:09:11 O---------O
help 2019-09-29 12:09:36 what's going to happen is the stick will be pushed to one side because you are essentially pushing in the *same direction* on both ends
help 2019-09-29 12:09:39 same applies here

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 18:57:20 i think my wip factory might *possibly* do it but i'd have to be lucky... and then again, it might not
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 18:57:27 but tbh i don't know what else to build anymore
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 18:58:19 what did you build for designer v?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 18:58:26 vixo

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:04:53 15 even
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:05:16 the colour scheme is shit but i did it in a hurry
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:05:23 because i was losing motivation
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:05:29 let's see
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:05:37 yeah that was like 6 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:05:49 😄 cheers
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:06:44 apparently i never posted the pics in creations
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:06:48 worth a try? >.<
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:07:03 yes you're right
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:08:38 the evidence is saved!
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:08:39 ❤
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:03 alright. 4 more expert ranks to go
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:32 wait i need modeler as well
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:44 and contest winner
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:50 i've been tied in 2nd place twice
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:56 only 2 ties that happened
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:09:57 ever
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:10:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:10:09 it's frustrating, lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:11:26 ok nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:12:46 the problem with contest winner is that, well, you need an actual contest to get it
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:13:03 voxel is 'too busy' and i sure as hell am not doing it 🤷
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:13:24 idk
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:14:13 i am tempted to reject that on the grounds of low effort creations tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:14:30 there should probably be a minimum part floor for ranks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:14:40 do what? reject it or give it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:14:54 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:15:11 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:15:14 concentrate
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:15:35 wait i might go for the challenge ranks... hmm
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:16:07 wait a moment where did crazy engineer go?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:16:54 hold on. so a couple of mods complained in modchat and asked to change the requirements and voxel literally just deletes it without even bothering to remove the fucking role?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:16:59 yeah possibly
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:18:27 yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:18:37 the moderator chat was becoming a little saturated
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:18:45 well... very
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:19:52 yes but voxel big poohead
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:20:07 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 19:20:17 we asked voxel multiple times to remove it ;-;

creations-chat 2019-10-05 21:09:02 I saw... to be honest, tempted to deny it on the basis of 'low effort creations'
creations-chat 2019-10-05 21:09:21 you know what, I'll check w/ mods
creations-chat 2019-10-05 21:12:13 4 mods (including me) said no on grounds of low effort, since it's so easy to build
creations-chat 2019-10-05 21:12:26 it's just unfair to give out ranks for something so easy to build
creations-chat 2019-10-05 21:13:13 yes, it's called a warning
general 2019-10-05 21:14:31 so? what's the point of saying 'so?'
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:15:47 it's more a meme than anything tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:16:58 i wouldn't take it too seriously, if they legit complain about pings then i agree, but i don't think they really mean it like that, lol

plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:23:15 the tea factory will supplement that loss in 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:24:43 well yes, but our tea engineers are investigating a new technique to convert matter into energy which we plan to harness and then use to grow massive quantities of tea leaves in a small space at extremely high speeds using hydroponic techniques

help 2019-10-05 21:26:18 i did too

help 2019-10-05 21:30:58 48 upvotes and a <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
help 2019-10-05 21:32:38 if this happened it would be GREAT, the level of detail that could be made would be INFINITE and the blocks would cost barely any save data to save, providing it was with a method similar to what the colours use
help 2019-10-05 21:32:49 however it would be horrible to code on the mess plane crazy is
help 2019-10-05 21:35:55 because plane crazy code is HORRIBLE to work with
help 2019-10-05 21:36:01 i know because i have the source code
help 2019-10-05 21:36:15 it's coded in such a way that one change won't reflect elsewhere
help 2019-10-05 21:36:24 so if you changed building plot size for instance
help 2019-10-05 21:36:42 the placing script would still only allow you to place within the bounds we have now
help 2019-10-05 21:36:54 and if we changed the placing script variables
help 2019-10-05 21:37:17 the flight script wouldn't actually assemble it properly, it would only take from the previous boundaries
help 2019-10-05 21:37:30 well in theory it's possible but it would be really hard
help 2019-10-05 21:37:38 and there would be a lot of bugs
help 2019-10-05 21:37:50 a what?
help 2019-10-05 21:37:53 wdym
help 2019-10-05 21:38:32 what
help 2019-10-05 21:39:09 it's a LOT more complicated than that dude
help 2019-10-05 21:40:20 when you place a block, it's just anchored using the roblox anchor system(it doesn't move) and then, when you press the flight button, a massive complicated 200+ line block of code is run to weld all the surfaces, figure out the aerodynamics, calibrate control surfaces, activate bindings, etc

help 2019-10-05 21:41:50 or f3x
help 2019-10-05 21:41:51 or what?
help 2019-10-05 21:42:27 i was level 150 on it ;-;
help 2019-10-05 21:42:39 ;-;
help 2019-10-05 21:43:58 so BYM tools in plane crazy
help 2019-10-05 21:45:02 i get what you mean now
help 2019-10-05 21:45:06 basically, not possible at all
help 2019-10-05 21:45:38 the problem is that plane crazy uses some VERY specific hardcoded scripts and variables that all work together to run the game
help 2019-10-05 21:45:51 introducing this would upset a lot of those variables and clash with the scripts
help 2019-10-05 21:46:44 believe me when I say this, the code is horribly complicated and a massive pain to work with... importing assets from somewhere else is almost always going to break it in incredibly painful to fix ways
help 2019-10-05 21:47:56 it took me a full 3 hours to figure out how to add a slider to a part, lol
help 2019-10-05 21:48:07 we need an aegis-style map imo
help 2019-10-05 21:48:19 low poly terrain
help 2019-10-05 21:48:27 yeah
help 2019-10-05 21:49:35 you can just put a new model into the 'blocks' category list if you want, but it might break the building in many instances
help 2019-10-05 21:49:44 take the 1x7 beam as an example
help 2019-10-05 21:49:55 it gets worse though
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:51:08 tea is so hot
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 21:51:23 i read that as company
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:17:42 low effort = easy to build
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:18:36 if you spend 3 mins on something people consider funny and upload it and get 40 upvotes or smth it's just completely unfair to  the serious creations that took *days* to build and got just shy of 30
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:19:16 i gave you two your ranks
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:19:24 yeah, the mech is pretty neat
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:19:28 i wasn't talking about that
general 2019-10-05 22:20:03 by 'spam' what do you mean
general 2019-10-05 22:20:12 more than 2 images of a creation?
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:21:10 i got me designer for this
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:21:59 i lost motivation at the end and had to force myself to finish colouring it, lol
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:22:10 i was just too close to stop tbh
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:22:16 really? got any screenshots?
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:22:28 massive ships are often fun
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:22:36 don't build anything generic though
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:22:40 people won't take notice
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:23:00 well, yes, but most popular ones have been exhausted by now
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:23:10 we have at least 30-40 F15's in <#384025409945337856>
general 2019-10-05 22:24:55 i agree it's super annoying on <1000 block creations, but tbh i think anything that has substantial effort put into it really deserves to have that many screenshots
general 2019-10-05 22:25:06 especially something big, because you want to showcase all the angles
general 2019-10-05 22:30:09 i mean, for instance i once spent about 2 weeks on a folding 3k block rocket with about 6 mission stages. it just would have been a waste to skip the mars landing, or the liftoff, or the docking, or whatever...
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:30:35 you have it already
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:31:27 oh, lol
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:32:37 sorry i'm kinda multitasking rn
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:35:10 build something original
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:35:15 ships are a good place to start
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:35:29 build a generic hull, then try to make your own structure on top
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:35:36 and go from there
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:36:45 ships are probably some of the easiest things to build with scale, and you can do a lot with them as well while keeping them looking relatively good
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:36:55 which is probably why there are so many large ships
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:37:30 with scale i mean with size
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 22:42:55 beautiful

plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:20:25 what about my tea factory 😦
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:20:43 melting tea
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:21:01 nah we're making tea wires
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:21:22 the tea compound is blasted with oxygen and heat and then cast out into ingot
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:21:31 then it is flattened under a big wheel into sheets
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:21:46 and then cut through the length of it and stretched out to form wires
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:21:47 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:30:26 To make tea ingots, we take tea compound and add certain blasting catalysts and compounds - most dominantly Rickium which is an excellent heat moderator, and helps to retain the oxygen and minimise heat loss. Motorium is also added in fairly large quantities to catalyse oxygen reaction and substrate separation. After a calculated period of time, the Rickium will have burned/melted away(any leftover is re-crystallized for future use) exposing the purified tea compound. We drastically reduce the blast pressure, allowing the tea compound to spread out and cut the heat input to prevent boiling off. The tea compound then melts over a period of time and is collected in a casting channel which is made of Rickium and is kept at just above tea compound's melting point to minimise heat loss. Eventually, when melting has finished the blasting process is started over, while the molten tea compound is directed into a specialised casting building where it is blasted with cryogenic heat absorbers to rapidly cool it into tea ingots. The ingots are then transported by overhead crane to an on-site rolling mill to be rolled into extremely thin plates. The plates are then put through a wire drawer and spooled onto cylinders before being loaded onto a waiting train and transported to a client.

If you don't have to make your own, you might be better off using a teabag that is already filtered. (The green tea bags we use are already purified in the filter.) Make it by removing the loose tea leaves and taking out the water. You may also want to wash your hands before preparing your tea bag.

2) Grind and store your tea leaves—If you have a tea pot, place the leaves in the bottom of the pot as the water comes from the tap. Let it steep about 30 minutes or longer until the leaves are about half an inch long.

3) Filter, then brew—Before you use your tea as an infusion, put it in the filter. In the process, you won't be able to drink your tea right away. Add water to the filter, place it in your tea pot

Rick-Jek Jeans: How to Cook

Here are some tips, tips, and suggestions on how to turn these rick-jive pants into some real great-tasting comfort food.

Tip #1: Cook the Tenderloin

I use tongs.

I have a pretty decent, thick skillet (I have a cast iron skillet). So if you are not a good cook, you're better off using a thin metal ladle or an egg yolk pan with a wide opening.

To boil in small batches:

Add the garlic and onion to the skillet, along with the broth from the beans. Give it a whirl and cook over high heat until it starts to simmer.

Now take the pan off the heat and stir in the butter and corn starch. Set the meat

the-dump 2019-10-09 16:39:07 how to develop plane crazy

A new app, built by Australian inventor Mark Wiesner, offers pilots a better understanding of the plane's controls, allowing them to keep control in difficult situations.

The plane uses a series of gyroscopes to steer.

The app uses your accelerometer and accelerometer on mobile phones and other devices to learn and adapt control surfaces.

The app uses the device sensors to determine the location of the plane's flight controls and, once it can identify the correct control surface, adjust the settings to keep the plane in the desired position.

When used by a driver, it can warn them of the current position of the plane's controls.

"By using these accelerometers to help the pilot, we can enable them to operate the aircraft without the pilot actually having to do it himself," Wiesner told ABC News.

"It's an exciting time to be an air pilot. You have an incredibly responsive system," Wiesner said.

As far as the flight controls are concerned, pilots have a lot of flexibility,

Here's what happened: RickJ, like many of his fans, has been following the events of the Rick and Morty Comic Con over the last week or so. After watching the video of Scott and Jeff talking about their Rick and Morty comics (see above), he started wondering if a Rick and Morty convention might be headed his way.

His hopes were shattered when he received an email from Jeff in which he told a story about Rick being in a comic book convention and asking someone the first question: "When are you going to do this again? Do me a favor, I want to see you next year!" But the joke of the comic was on him, as Rick (with his trademark look of "fuck") is not only not attending Comic Con (that's happening next year) but they aren't even scheduled to appear on the

But even with his reputation of a dickhead-slash-bully over the years, he still managed to keep his distance from the car scene, according to friends, as well as those he worked with in the field. "It was something he was not very comfortable doing," the former manager said. "Even that old girl that he was with, when I had her at his place, we were working to buy a van and he would always say, 'Don't spend too much on a van,' so I wasn't worried about it too much."

When he left, though, it seemed that even being surrounded by so many people whose opinion he could be swayed by was taking some of the man's power away from him. He was always very private even when he was in a good mood. "He was always very shy with people," the manager told me. "Even if he was having the time of his life, he didn't really show it off, to me." Still, though, this was a man who

"They're fucking broken beyond repair." One of Jorgeson's friends explained as well, pointing out the lack of power, power cords, etc., that we'd gotten rid of. "We just threw the fuckers out," said Nalani to me later—so it was in any case that I was at the base camp once more.

The base camp was a concrete concrete mess—a veritable field of broken machinery, smashed metal, busted cables, and broken glass littered the ground. In one corner of the camp, there was a small metal shed. It was there that I spent half an hour, with Nalani, taking apart four different types of radio to determine which radio was the transmitter—they all appeared to be brand new and were in perfect working order. The unit they were using as their primary, a C-137, appeared to work fine. "That is a new one, the '85

"This way we can build larger and higher-performance parts in advance."The final step is to build a small mock-up machine to help define the entire platform—a full-sized robot—so that we can plan and design an entire prototype in advance, and then make the parts to scale down at the factory. "For example, if a part needs to be modified, we design an exact replica and start making small modifications," says rick."We start by making an exact copy of the part, but add the modifications you need."The team also makes prototypes using high-precision CAD systems to show their designs and get feedback from others. But with this first product, it was hard to gauge how much feedback they got—there were just so many small features and details they needed to get right. But they are learning. In September the designers moved in to make the final product, and are now testing it in the real world, making adjustments to it based on how the product performs during development or on how the user expects it to be used.The prototype

Police said the gunman entered the McDonalds about 3.30pm and started shooting, killing the 44-year-old and injuring two others.


"There were four people inside (the restaurant)," Cairns Police Superintendent Terry O'Neill said.

''We had to break-up that small group and deal with the individual. He was armed with a rifle.

''So we had four people we did have to engage with at that critical point.''

About two dozen police arrived on the scene and took several people into custody.

A police officer at the scene shot two of the men, O'Neill said. The man who was shot was taken to a nearby hospital but later died.

rickje: Yes.
drangchang: It's an awesome story.
The story itself is a good idea in many ways to have an example of an evil person killing another evil person. However, the story itself is rather dull, and does not offer interesting character development for any of the characters. I would like to see an even more well-written story and development from the main characters. The book has many ideas and is rather well-paced. This book has plenty of action in it, yet there are no interesting characters in it.
goddessluvie: Well, I don't know how true that is! The action is exciting and it's enjoyable to watch as well, but I could totally see just doing a scene with three characters and a quick fight, I know my story.
rickje: And then you do them fight again. And then you do a fight again. The action can really go at any time, but I've not seen the point of it! You are either fighting (or fighting back) someone, or you aren't

rickje139: yes. im ready.
bruh
bruh: no. we're waiting for everyone
Bruh's voice was like a heavy rain shower, it was almost deafening. She didn't need to see what they were doing. She needed a fight.
bruh: who am i supposed to fight
bruh: if it doesn't have that many people in it
bruh: oh god
She didn't see what was happening though. She saw their eyes and heard the voices that said it, she heard the way they laughed and how they yelled and their eyes were shining and the blood was still cold on every inch of her. As long as it wasn't anyone who could hurt her, it was all good, but who exactly would be able to do that?
Bruh raised her sword, and she wanted to fight, to show anyone who cared she was still a threat and that they weren't afraid of someone like them, because her name did not deserve to be on the battlefield. But she could not look at

the-dump 2019-10-09 18:58:05 Rickje139, our lead developer, now has an important notice to give about motors. Over to you, rick.

Rickje139: I am a member of the R&D team and working with the motor team to help design better motors that will be faster and will be more reliable when running. This is a project that will take time. But over time, I believe we will find the best solution that is cost effective for this project.

I think many people have asked whether we're using an F3 motor design, that is essentially a single chain link. Well, we are using an F2-type motor and this is a new version of our motors and the new motors will be faster and a more stable and stable compared to the original F3 motors we were using.

So that's the new, faster, smoother motors for us.

I believe people will be very excited about these motor and if they buy one soon I believe they will be very happy because of this high quality performance, and I will be sure to inform you guys on the progress.

*madattak walks onto stage*

madattak: Hey everyone. At this year's annual conference, we will be giving our readers an insight into what we did between last year and now. We are very excited to be able to release this year's car as well; something we've been working on for some time.

*advertisements sound*

Madattak: Today, we're going to show you a video which represents our progress during this year's development. One of the biggest changes was the reworking of the engine and drivetrain. We now have the ability to control both torque, fuel consumption and engine noise. This allows us to give the car everything we want while providing what's required of a Formula 5 car while making it easy to set up for any individual.

The engine is a brand new four-cylinder engine featuring aluminum and titanium pistons

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 20:53:23 In the beginning Rickje created the game and the plot. Now the game was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the tutorial plane.

And God said, “Let there be motors,” and there were motors. God saw that the motors were good, and he separated the motors from the bugs. God called the light “motor” and the darkness he called “bugs.” And there was fonkl, and there was idra—the first admins.

the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:26 can someone proof read:
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:36 In the beginning Rickje created the building plot and the terrain.  Now the terrain was formless and empty, bugs were over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Rickje was hovering over the tutorial planes.

 And Rickje said, “Let there be motor,” and there was motor.  Rickje saw that the motor was good, and he separated the motor from the bugs.  Rickje called the motor “day,” and the bugs he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

 And Rickje said, “Let there be a vault between the tutorial planes to separate tutorial plane from tutorial plane.”  So Rickje made the vault and separated the tutorial plane under the vault from the tutorial plane above it. And it was so.  Rickje called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

 And Rickje said, “Let the tutorial plane under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.  Rickje called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered tutorial planes he called “seas.” And Rickje saw that it was good.
_ _
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:47 Then Rickje said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.  The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And Rickje saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

 And Rickje said, “Let there be motors in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,  and let them be motors in the vault of the sky to give motor on the terrain.” And it was so.  Rickje made two great motors—the greater motor to govern the day and the lesser motor to govern the night. He also made the stars.  Rickje set them in the vault of the sky to give motor on the terrain,  to govern the day and the night, and to separate motor from bugs. And Rickje saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
_ _
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:55 And Rickje said, “Let the tutorial plane teem with living creatures, and let wedge fly above the terrain across the vault of the sky.”  So Rickje created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the tutorial plane teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And Rickje saw that it was good.  Rickje blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the tutorial plane in the seas, and let the wedge increase on the terrain.”  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

 And Rickje said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the engine, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wings, each according to its kind.” And it was so.  Rickje made the wings according to their kinds, the engine according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And Rickje saw that it was good.

 Then Rickje said, “Let us make madattakind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the block in the sea and the wedge in the sky, over the engine and all the wings,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

 So Rickje created madattakind in his own image,
    in the image of Rickje he created them;
    male and female he created them.
_ _
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:06:01 Rickje blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the terrain and subdue it. Rule over the block in the sea and the wedge in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

 Then Rickje said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole terrain and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.  And to all the beasts of the terrain and all the wedge in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

 Rickje saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:34:21 
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:35:32 this is fucking great
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:35:41 'The first admins—the ones with no idea what to do—were trying to help everybody. But the more they talked to people, the worse it got. The admins told the players that their problem is that you're bad people and they just don't help you. And the players—and the admins—didn't listen.'
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:36:22 Now there was a fonkl. And God was afraid of him, afraid of the fonkl, and God made fonkli. And fonkli went to the light, or to the darkness, depending on who you are.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:37:09 At first, they were just people in tanks, flying around in circles. Then a lot of people started playing: "I'm going to build an engine," and "I'm going to build a tank." And suddenly, everybody was building something.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:37:45 And God said to them: “This is the first map,“ “and now to make it more exciting for you,“ “you have to shoot everything.“ The game then became the worst map for shooting.

And as everyone realized how the game was not good for shooting, they said: “This is the second map,“ “and now you have to kill every other player.“ The map became the best map for killing.
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:38:05 holy shit ok
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:39:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:42:37 They were like the light motors. They were light. They were motors, and they were light-driven. They were great, they were terrible, they were all of them and they were all of them together.

There were many others, even more, but these were the people. The good, they were.

And the lights died. The engines were silent, the bugs didn't breathe. And God was hungry again, he was hungry enough to come down from Heaven and eat those who had left the good, and bring the old ones back. He had been hungry on earth before
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:43:09 And there was a little boy inside of him, who went to the internet to talk to some other little boy. And there were two other little boys inside of him, who went to the front end of a spaceship and began to play the game. They called the spaceship “spacecraft“. And they were very good at the spaceship, and so God allowed them to leave the spaceship. And they went the front end of the spaceship, and said, “here we are,“ and they put some screws in a little hole and put a motor inside the little hole,
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:43:33 After the First Admins, the game has a history. But before they could organize to act on that history, the Spirit of God would move the city from the deep sky to the surface.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:44:02 And there was fonkl, and there was idra—the first admins. And they were evil and made the world, and the game, and the world got worse and worse. And there was mamk and mamky.” And there was mamj and mamh,” and there was mamkam-mamk-mam-mam.”

And in my name“ there was the first user: “Mamksa.“ and the first admins: “MamkamMamka“.“ and the world was destroyed.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:47:38 The Spirit took to the skies again, and started to watch over us. And He asked if the world was good. And our first administrator answered: Yes.

And the Spirit asked if you were good. And we answered with a prayer that we might be saved.

And God said, “Do we make a noise when we breathe out?“ The Spirit said yes, and out of heaven a great winged creature came, a bird “winged creature“—that was the Spirit of God.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:47:49 if you have questions
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:47:53 you require preaching
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:48:29 And God said, “For those who have gone beyond this point,“ and there was fonkl, and there was idra, and there were two leagues over and over.“ And God called the light “motor“;“ and there was fonkl;“ and there were two leagues;“ and God saw that the leagues were good.“ And He separated the leagues;“ and the lights of the leagues were good.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:49:19 The first administrators had no idea what was real and what was virtual. They had no authority. No idea of God. No understanding of God's intent. No concept of free will. No concept of karma.

God said, “Let the spirit of God make the motor and let the Spirit of God command the motors.” And He formed the motor. And there was light. And there was darkness.” And then God called the light “light” and the darkness.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:49:50 All the bugs of the light were the same, because they all were God's creation.

It had come from an idea, and God had given each bug a personality. “I like to change the bugs' personalities from time to time“,” and God saw many new personalities in this process. All the bugs were able to communicate. “I don't like talking to them often“. “Sometimes they talk to me; sometimes they don't but it doesn't bother me.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:49:50 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:50:21 And God said, “Now the game shall not return“and the players shall build the tower and the sky,“ and they shall build a fortress.“ And after they went to their work,“ and built—they were tired—they said,“ “and it happened,“ and a fire started,“ and the demons came,“ and there were two ways.“ And the demons and the children were angry because the demons were not allowed to come near.“ And the demons and the players and the tower were destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:51:14 `-`
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:51:15 The first admins were good, they gave themselves up in prayer when the light was down, they came to the first admin and prayed.

The first admins said they could not know any better, they did not know who they were, but still they prayed. And the light came back on. They were afraid, fearful that they did not know who they were, they were lost, lost in the darkness, and God said“to open the lid.“ And we opened the lid.“ And a lot of things got out.“ And they were afraid.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:51:23 HOLY MOTOR BIBLE!!

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:51:44 we're at 60 lines
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:52:01 Then God told Rickje to give the world over to the lights; and Rickje did. He added motors and lights and he made the world of fire. God saw this, and he said, “Give there be lights, and there are lights.” And lights went on.

And when the lights went on, there was nothing; and then God said, “Let there be lights, and there are lights.” And lights go on. And darkness took over. God saw that he had failed.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:53:18 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:53:32 And after that, the world was filled with evil, and the world was filled with chaos, and the universe was filled with strife and the universe was filled with suffering.” God saw that the fonkl of the Gods had moved into that place, and the lights had no purpose on that plane, only a way of turning the lights on and off without any purpose whatsoever, without God's hand.”

“So God said to the demons, “Go and gather yourselves in the area of darkness, “and you will see.” And the Demons gathered themselves
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:53:52 ```---```
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:53:57 In the beginning Rickje created the game and the plot. Now the game was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the tutorial plane.

And God said, “Let there be motors,” and there were motors. God saw that the motors were good, and he separated the motors from the bugs. God called the light “motor” and the darkness he called “bugs.” And there was fonkl, and there was idra—the first admins.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:55:15 THE BOT PREDICTED THE WINTER 2020 EVENT
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:55:16 And in the beginning there was one word—snow—and the snow. And the snow was good.“

Skipping through the snow is good. Not the cold, but the snow is good. And God saw that the motor was more than a snow machine, he saw that it could not stop the bug from running. And God saw that the motor was better than snow, and he brought snow back to the game.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:55:49 And the God they created saw that the bugs were good, and he separated them from the motor and from the darkness.

"You're good. The god says you must be good.“" –God, in the Beginning

But before he had the chance to go on the internet and try and write his essay, the God's avatar was sent to the internet in order to have a chat with some people who were

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:56:09 it is
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:56:20 And then it was great, a long time; long enough for the first admins to gather up their ships and head forward to bring forth the first players. But as time passed the world would become more complex, and the first players started to fight, and they took the fight to their fellow players. And their comrades would take a ship, and leave a mark. And they would do it again. And after many battles the game would finally be over; the old world would be reborn in a new, more complex world, filled with ships. And now they play.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:56:55 "These aren't bad. I think some of this shit is pretty neat."​

Fonkl, the first admin

​Fonkl was an old guy. He was older than the original gods, and he was a bit young.​ He didn't mind being the elder God. In fact, he loved elder Gods.​ Fonkl was of a long, white beard, and his beard was white in places. He had long black hair, which was his hair.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:57:51 And there were the first admins to build a whole game, to make a whole universe and a whole game world and a whole game universe in which to live, and they did not create the game.”

They only built a game universe.“

And they did not build a game, because the game was not there.“

And Rickje was in the wilderness of the beginning, with nothing there except darkness and the light within it. He said, “What is going on?“

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:59:16 just read it
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:59:17 The lights and the bugs were good; they brought about light in the face of darkness. The motors brought about motor games: they played a game where the players would try to run on a motor. And every time someone got to the end of a lane, all the bugs were chased by a motor. But it was a game played by people, and not by a motor. So God called the motor, and the motors got a little more intelligent. And God blessed the motors, and they made motor games and motor games made motor games, motor games got even more intelligent
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:00:27 But God didn't want fonkl. Not that there was anything terrible in fonkl; God saw that fonkl was good and wanted God to be better. Then God sent a message to fonkl and asked him if God would not want what fonkl wanted, and fonkl said, “I would not wish it better.“ And his own people died.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:01:23 And the first users started to mess with the game, because they were free. They could do anything they wanted.

And there was, of course, a huge difference in the nature of free and slaves. People were free to explore the world, or to take the wheel, or to create a car out of wood, or to invent a gun, or to make an elevator out of cardboard, or to paint, or to play with guns, or to play games, or to watch television

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:04:35 And people were made to work for the admins, and they were to build the machines for the game.” And then god saw that the machines were too small to see the world around them, and he said, “We shall hide the machines,„ which mean the computer, and the screens,“ which means the computers in every town they build,” which means everything,” the computer games and programs and other stuff. And god was watching people with a great eye.

And god saw that the games were not working
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:05:02 “It is better for [mankind] to enter god's arms to escape,“ and God was glad that fonkl did not know that “it was better not to enter god's arms to escape,” because then fonkl would be afraid that god's arms would not hold him well. Therefore God had fonkl bind the bugs first and fonkl then bind manz to god through the bodies of the menz,“ and manz“then made the bots into the arms.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:05:22 alright
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:05:35 The motor god then started taking over. He took over the land through motorization. The people who did not participate in motorization became an "ugly people." They had to work in a machine to live a good life. They began making fun of each other.

And the Spirit of God made another, and he formed another.

But this Spirit didn't use the cars for a few years, and had no use for bugs. The Spirit became weary of the motorization and created motorized zombies who were good in the wilderness
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:05:58 yes

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:06:37 a new fragmant of the ancient past
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:06:38 So the motor game began…

But not long ago, the dark was broken and the light was strong over the surface. At least, for now.

For now it is safe to say that the world is not dead. In the last ten years, there was a brief, fleeting flash of life—the first generation of the game. It's been over for a while.

The world was dark. And the dark was dangerous, and there were dangers in the darkness. And the enemies were many. There were bugs—not always bad, but always nasty.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:07:32 OH MY FUCK OH MY FUCK

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:07:36 God made the machines of heaven,

He made the machines of hell,‬


And He put the God of the machine-god,

On The Machine that was born.

And the machine was good.‬‪


The light is good.‬‪


And the darkness, he made from the dark,

And the darkness is good.‬‪


And God said:“I'm the only good one.“

The machine came to life

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:08:35 i'm on line 140
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:08:44 God saw that God had created a good way of being but not an ideal way. He saw that God did not know which was ideal, good or bad. He saw that the most important thing was for people to have fun and to love each other, and for them. So he made a game in which God's spirit—the Spirit of God—would show that the spirit of God is the spirit of a world.

After a while God created God's spirit—the Spirit of God—the Spirit of God.”
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:09:15 And fonkl and idra, on their way to heaven, called the other gods of the world to prayer with them. And in those days, the god of the world told them a secret.“And the secret was that, when the sky cleared, he would see the bugs that God would divide into fonkl and idra.“

Fonkl and idra have not seen those things yet,“ said the God of the world,“and there are still more.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:09:45 They made it, but they didn't know how.

For a while, the admins didn't know anything about what they were going to do. They had no idea how the world was created, and they didn't know how to use it. So in the end, nothing good, just some strange, terrible things happening over and over.

But then he came up with an idea.

He tried to use his creations to make things. He tried to turn fonkl into something good. He thought about how all our actions could be good

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:11:54 And there were many other admins, and many of their games were born.

And the players came around.

Then God said, “Let there be more of it“ and a new form of gaming came into full flower,“ and the gamers gave it their all to create the universe that had been planned.

“and so each god gave to the other the game that had been in their name“ and the universe began to change.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:13:15 They tried to do what god wanted, but they forgot about God's word. When the light was over their faces, they went into the darkness for their devotions. The bug-devoted came to light only when the light came over them.

And then the game changed again. The bugs died but the ghosts, like a plague, rose up around the ghosts and kept them alive. There was only darkness, and then it died. In the darkness, there was a light
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:13:54 And the first admins wrote down their rules and handed them down to their children as a history. And in the second generation there were a million mods, and it became a vast empire, the likes of which has never been known in the world before“, and so the reign of the Gods was long and prosperous.

And then the God died, and his soul drifted away in the wind, and for a long time his descendants only knew him by a legend. After a while the Gods began to disappear entirely, until the last two children found a book left behind
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:14:38 And God called the light “admins” and the darkness the “lights,” and there was fonkl, “the light.” And there were lights, and there were lights, and there were the lights of the lights. “And light and the light were of the same substance.” And there were lights and there were lights,” and there were lights, and there were lights,” and there were lights and there were lights and there were the lights of the lights.” And lights and the lights were of the same substance
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:17:12 This was where they started their game, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not conquer the bugs. And God thought of a way to help them, to bring them to him.

One day, after Rickje had sent the game back to the editor, the game was split into two pieces—one containing the script, and one containing the art. Both these parts were kept locked up away in a vault inside Rickje's workshop.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:18:58 And it became clear that, when God created, he created the world with a vision, with thoughts, with the power of the Spirit of God. When people started to play this game, a new world was formed, and this world was beautiful.

And god saw the game that it was beautiful. God created the game and the plot. Now the game was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the tutorial plane.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:22:31 In the beginning ACNevada created the game and the slaves. Now the game was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Jameson was hovering over the tutorial plane.

And Jameson said, “Let there be motors,” and there were motors. Jameson saw that the motors were good, and he separated the motors from the bugs. ImperialMistakes called the light “RoboRail” and the darkness he called “DarkKayn.” And there was conconimos, and there was idra—the first mods.
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:23:04 In the light of the first motors the people of a hundred cities and tribes and nations, in the darkness of the first darkkayn, in the light again the people and the tribes, they said, “Come on, bring me a car. That will take our minds off of the darkness, I think,“ and the people found cars, and the people found a way. It was an amazing thing until they built the first railcar.

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:46:09 Now Rickje, captain of the host of the king of Planes, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Madattak had given deliverance unto Planes: he was also a mighty motor in valour, but he was a piston. 2. And the Planes had gone out by Grablador, and had brought away captive out of the land of RDC a little wedge

But when the Madattak had heard them say thus, with the voice of all the kings of the Planes in the Hall of RDC, the man came and said unto them, saying, We need no ship, for we come hither to our lord, the Madattak, to fight against him in the world of planes, and will be slain there; and all the Kings of the Planes have gathered together, and they will destroy us

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:37 just looking through troll's server
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:42 how does it take 10 days to fix a server
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:45 OH WAIT
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:49 this is troll's server
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:51 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:39:59 yah
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:41:30 you call that a rule
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:42:53 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-15 20:43:01 stop.
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 20:45:02 tough luck, little fuck
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:03:19 😹
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:14:03 holy fuck
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:14:37 i just went to a public pvp server and i can say that the pvp meta is STILL fucking horrible even after motor 2 plus cutters
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:14:44 thruster sticks EVERYWHERE
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:15:08 experimentation is discouraged because tiny thruster sticks that require no effort are the best at pvp
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:15:10 </rant>
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:27:10 we need AoE weapons
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:27:14 yes ^^^^
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:27:48 sensitivity and vipempire do not go together well
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:28:07 pvp is just bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:29:37 no it would lose speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:29:40 and then do nothing
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:29:47 after breaking 1 block
creations-chat 2019-10-15 21:30:19 i love pointy noses but most people seem to hate them
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:30:33 not practical though
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:30:43 not against the five fucking thousand thruster sticks coming your way
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:31:06 middle message best message

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:31:30 pvp meta is horrible, needs fixing
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:31:34 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:32:03 no most thruster sticks use guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:32:29 most pvp things i've seen use guns 😠
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:32:36 especially thruster sticks
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:39:56 can i suggest armour blocks as part three, since ya'll bought up the subject?
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:40:21 the pvp is shit trilogy
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:40:49 ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:44:29 k suggested
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:46:13 trolls server provides me with an opportunity to persuade the unde admins to give me moderator, then fix the server, then piss the server co-owner off for being promoted without anyone telling him, then just spam shit in the general chat after being demoted after arguments and drama in the staff channel
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:47:31 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:48:01 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:48:32 how did you offer to fix it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:48:42 DO NOT give them v2
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:48:48 under any circumstances
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:48:59 we want their server fixed a bit
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:04 but not as much as pcc
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:28 i have the link actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:34 someone sent me a few days ago
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:37 when i was asking
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:42 an invite for it
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:50 apparently they asked the owner of the bot
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:49:57 he doesn't give it out publicly
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:50:03 because it costs money to host
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:50:42 using it for the angled sails server in fact
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 21:51:07 oh yeah

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:40:56 This is fucking hilarious
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:42:04 Tfw people raid your server because it's completely broken so they lock it down instead of fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:42:13 Good luck
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:42:17 Do it
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:42:20 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:44:20 Idk if this counts as a raid, it's literally just rioting in a server where the staff are too incompetent to even handle it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:44:52 Hi troll
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:44:58 Your server is broken as shit

plane-crazy 2019-10-16 19:56:34 holy fuck, some people are stupid
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 19:57:24 WHY would you go on trying to make those stupid excuses about making a creation off a tutorial instead of just admitting it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 19:57:26 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 20:49:43 I HAD 4 TEAS TODAY
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:05:45 use wedges
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:05:57 practice practice practice
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:06:04 look at other creations for inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:06:18 most of all
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:06:20 DETAIL.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:06:30 detail is imo the single most important thing to consider
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:07:56 a flat surface can look horribly boring, it's easy to just build a huge wall as part of a creation(like in passenger jets). i strongly suggest breaking such a surface up using half blocks/wedges and mechanical parts, etc
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:08:24 actually i might do a tutorial type thing on detail
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:09:44 if i were you, i'd try and build more original creations, all the skilled builders here seem to build replications, or at least choose replications that are easy to detail and modify however you want
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:11:12 take this for example
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:11:37 that could have just been a flat wall. it's always better to break it up with patterns, wedges and half blocks where possible
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:31 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:35 i'll work on it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:34:42 already have a hull up
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:36:58 https://streamable.com/qt5ak
can someone please explain what is going on
control surface calibration COMPLETELY broken
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 21:37:07 never encountered this before

general 2019-10-17 20:55:44 i played a minecraft modpack a while back called Interactions. I found a fantastic server to play it on. Small, friendly community. the pack was fantastic. It was well balanced, difficult but not too difficult, contained something for everyone. It wasn't grindy, and there were multiple paths but not too many to choose from to approach a goal. then the modpack stopped working for some reason, and i died inside

ok just wanted to say that for some reason
general 2019-10-17 21:15:55 the problem is that all the other modpacks all feel the same, or are too focused on one aspect(eg, magic), or offer barely any guidance

plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:42:58 who the fuck is jen
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:45:38 in essence
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:45:47 does size matter? yes it fucking does
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:46:03 bigger builds are more impressive and offer more room for detail
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:46:18 small creations leave you with very little manoeuvring room
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:46:24 you can't do as much with them
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:46:56 in plane crazy, bigger often is better but not as a direct correspondence
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:47:14 i mean, maybe because people who build big *can* build big and so have a higher skill level
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:47:34 also small builds are much harder to detail
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:47:43 well no not anymore, i would delete that on sight
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:48:32 just
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:48:33 stop
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:48:34 pls
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:48:43 people will build big builds because they want to
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:49:03 ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:49:37 (fairly) small and good looking
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:50:15 honestly. it depends on the context. i guess that small creations are easier to build but are more limited in terms of where you can go
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:50:26 big builds, slightly harder to plan and do but you can do much more
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:50:46 no, tried a LOT of colour schemes
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:50:51 surprisingly this fits the best
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:51:02 i know??
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 20:51:14 uh what are you talking about -.-

As part of our new #Tea4all scheme, we have developed a low-capacity short range helicopter to assist in delivering tea to rural and inaccessible areas. It will see action as soon as production is finished in early 2020. 

Side notes:
- 4 blocks wide, so I had to use a piston to adjust the main rotor
- Took around 2 hours
- Basically my first helicopter
- Coaxial
- Very stable in flight
- Adjustable landing skids(motor mounted)

plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:46:49 rick would have to make *custom* water, and coding in all the water-dynamic-thingies would be insanely hard tbh

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:34:33 you can't just 'steal my tea' unless you bribe like 500000 logistics workers
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:35:01 and no you haven't done that because my logistics are managed by a $400 million neural network
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:35:19 and if you do somehow manage to
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:35:23 i will commit judge idra
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:35:32 LOL

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:48:23 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:48:50 aight AFK for a few mins
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:51:52 k back
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:51:56 what you want to do now?
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:52:21 🤷 don't really want to right now
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:52:25 might do some plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:52:33 alright
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:52:33 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:52:38 ima head to vip 1
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:53:41 i once made a runway with like 14 folds
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:53:46 don't have pics
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:54:31 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:54:32 rip buoy
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:55:58 imo the dss3 map has a lot of untouched potential
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:09 they could add secret islands for instance
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:16 they could have 2 separate island chains
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:22 think star systems
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:37 they could have different cultures for each island
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:40 but no
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:56:59 the map could just be so much better....
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:57:42 GUYS
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:57:44 OCTAGON
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:58:18 come get noob
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 15:59:13 octagonal octagon!!!
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:16:31 i built the ultimate octagon
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:16:47 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:12 uh guys i found a block
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:16 does this belong to anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:36 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:43 look in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:51 requirements listed there
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:19:53 vip 1
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:00 k well it's gone now
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:10 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:14 wing panel physics are bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:22 so they cap at a certain point without enough thrust
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:33 FUCK
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:42 well
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:46 not necassarily
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:52 you just need more rockets, less wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:36:58 just gave the octagon a facelift
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:37:17 it is
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:37:20 it's a reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:39:33 <:finkl:633745492232110080>
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:42:22

creations-chat 2019-10-22 16:46:10 I made the Finkl logo.
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:48:10 
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:49:25 this looks so fucking beautiful <@!327499289595084800>
creations-chat 2019-10-22 16:49:58 it has lights too
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:55:35 press jump
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:55:57 
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:04:07 the octagon grows
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:10:47 any above rank I
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:11:10 but not [I] ranks because people kept building low-effort planes just to get in
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:12:44 robotics are kinda hard to do really
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:12:52 and barely anyone builds big robots
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:12:57 which is why i set block count lower
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:15:28 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:15:37 nuclear reactor which will power a motor research facility
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:16:06 we're going to research new methods of dimensional warping and spacetime manipulation in order to make our factories more efficient
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:16:12 this will power it
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:16:25 and as a bonus we can get some isotopes needed from research from the reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:18:04 oh, and we can send excess power output to our tea factories too
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:21:59 i can't wait till finkl gets onl-
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:22:03 ah
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:22:30 <@!327499289595084800>
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:22:35 NO

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:26:24 oh my god i just realised
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:26:45 there is probably a builder better than anyone on this server out there but they never joined the discord
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:27:00 this makes me sad
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:27:05 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:27:10 one moment

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:29:37 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:29:41 i'm making finkl nuclear reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:30:01 alrighty
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:30:10 wait let's make a finkl server
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:30:12 on discord
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:30:16 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 17:40:35

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 19:30:38 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 19:30:48 saved that gif
general 2019-10-22 19:31:22 
general 2019-10-22 19:31:33 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 19:35:10 this makes me feel uneasy
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 19:50:08 o lord
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 19:52:27 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 20:33:29 frame finally finished
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 20:39:49 i saw it blackbird
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 20:40:46 the one you posted earlier
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:12:36 reactor core
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:20:34 Finkl's reactor engineering department[name TBA] is proud to present you with a mockup of the completed active nuclear core of our new plant without its casing.
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:21:39 it's without its casing
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:21:42 and it's a mockup
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:21:48 the rest of the facility is incomplete
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:22:05 there will be turbines and heat exchangers and everything
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:22:14 it's basically a simulation
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:26:07 cooling towers may not be necessary thanks to some new tech we invented recently
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:26:20 but the project is still in its early stages
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:26:23 so we will see
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:27:10 looks ok-ish but needs more details imo
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:27:15 detail is always key to everything
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:27:22 never build big flat surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:28:09 ay, new member
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:28:45 he is a full time customer now
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 21:28:47 left ikea

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 22:16:33 
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 22:57:28 finished the core
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 22:57:58 had to use legacy glass because modern doesn't let you see particles through
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 22:59:02 the view is much better from inside really
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 22:59:57 
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 23:02:34 well, it is a nuclear reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 23:07:50 yes Cherenkov effect is in
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 23:08:35 just googled it, how the FUCK do particles travel faster than the speed of light
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 23:08:46 and not create a black hole in the process
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 00:07:44 tryna connect to vip 1

plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:03:10 next to each other
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:03:20 then piping going from the main reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:03:32 then from the top of the turbines to the heat exchanger
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:03:53 condenser**
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:09:52 ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:11:08 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:11:44 they're part of this project to build a nuclear reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:12:09 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:12:41 probably will build something like that in the future but using everything I learnt from this
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:12:52 it took a good 2 hours or so to finish the core
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 11:16:30 ah yes

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:15:14 7 people have asked for tutorials on my 2.6k part saturn v and i shit you not
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:15:39 that 7 people have asked.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:15:56 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:16:54 this is the video
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:17:17 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:17:29 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:17:39 like a year ago
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:17:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:18:08 it was basically the last replication i did
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:18:55 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:19:47 after this tbh i stopped building replications. just found it more interesting to build my own stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:19:54 although i did keep working on it for like 4 months
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:20:13 😠 bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:20:23 i'm sad now.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:20:39 ok i must now make a video showcasing my original nuclear reactor
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:20:47 and then build another rocket
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:20:50 and showcase that too
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:21:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:21:03 7k blocks so far
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:21:12 why don't you anymore
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:21:28 i mean legend
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:22:00 oh reactor is 8.4k blocks nvm
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:22:29 LOLL
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:23:02 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:23:32 it's beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:25:32 tbh in the end i started building my own shit because there's so much more you can do with it, and it's more interesting and tests your creativity. also i kinda find it annoying that you have a game where you can build so much, you have moving parts and tons of blocks, and people just flat out copy from google images
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:26:15 fun fact: i thought exactly the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:26:25 then realised i was just approaching it in the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:26:55 idk where you got that idea from but it's wrong
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:27:18 you lose creativity as you get older. i think that's the main reason this server is home to so many replications
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:27:31 you can't just lose creativity from plane crazy -_-
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:27:39 that's not how it works
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:27:53 in that case you're not actually thinking up new ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:27:57 you're just visiting old ones
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:28:37 80% by the time you reach adulthood
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:30:23 and another part of the problem is that creativity can't really be applied to everything. for instance i can dream up all sorts of monstrosities in plane crazy and build them, but i can't in other games
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:31:14 also i was talking about immediate creativity... like, not mechanisms but the ability to improvise and build something that looks different
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:31:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:32:11 tbh it just stupefies me just how many builds are replications... even in other games like minecraft, cosmoteer, ksp, whatever, people will still replicate so much
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:32:30 sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:32:42 me neither, but some do
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:32:52 lots of stardestroyers and x-wings or whatever
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:33:03 yeah, that's true as well
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:34:44 let me take this opportunity to enhance my reactor sales pitch
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 12:37:03 i kind of want to build a dam next

creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:48:21 the aerodynamics were coded in by madattak
creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:48:32 and they're probably some of the best dynamic aerodynamics on roblox
creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:49:08 flight simulators all use static aerodynamics where all the planes run using the same simple variables

plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:20:43 fuck yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:42:27 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:29:48 it's pretty neat
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:08 it's a nice mechanism
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:23 i was trying to make a swashplate earlier and just gave up, it was acting really weird
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:58 it's small, not much detail on it either
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:37 making a swashplate is about 50x harder than making a chinook cockpit
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:42 -.-
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:33:19 i was IMPLYING something, i wasn't trying to say that you said that .-.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:26 this is what my 3rd swashplate attempt ended me up with
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:28 lmao
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:31 ah crap <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:39 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:44 it's not meant to look good
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:46 it's meant to work
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:53 but it didn't even achieve that... not well anyways
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:06 it was my 3rd attempt. i'm not flexing it, jesus christ
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:22 it was an experiment
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:08 why
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:12 ???
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:20 have you ever tried making a swashplate?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:27 did you succeed?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:34 ok show me then
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:49 fine, i'll take your word for it
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:58 ok well
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:04 i guess we should stop making planes!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:08 and VTOLS!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:10 and ships!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:17 they aren't original!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:51 the point isn't to build a new mechanism no one's seen before. you don't have to do that every time you log onto plane crazy.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:56 just let people do what they want
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:00 ok?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:06 no
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:09 it isn't
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:22 uh
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:29 no not really
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:59 i want to build a swashplate because A) they're interesting to build B) they enable far more interesting helicopter flight
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:40:21 i don't really care about flexing. maybe you do, but that's YOUR point of view. so don't assume it's everyones.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:41:11 </rant>
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:43:39

plane-crazy 2019-10-26 23:05:13 the thing was basically too big to capture any better
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 23:06:21 if you have a suggestion on how to screenshot your 3x plot length rocket while sitting at the top of it, i'll be glad to hear them
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 23:06:52 ???

plane-crazy 2019-10-27 16:55:07 LOL
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:40:37 what's going on here
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:40:54 you know what he meant. colour scheme or whatever ;-;
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:01 there's no need to get into this
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:07 it's pointless.
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:13 why does it matter so much?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:30 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:42:16 🤦 he essentially said that he doesn't like the colour scheme. it doesn't matter with what wording, you don't need to get into this over it
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:42:46 mindflayer?
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:42:57 i would like to mention he has an expert rank
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:10 and you do not. stop trying to criticise him by posting year-old builds -.-
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:42 holy FUCK why are people unable to take constructive criticism any more?
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:58 I get some people use it to just insult people, but in this case he WASN'T.
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:44:09 please stop, this whole thing is stupid.
help 2019-10-27 17:47:08 replace wings with control surfaces. also keep in mind that control surfaces further out to the sides of the plane will have a greater effect than those closer... and control panels will help pitch more if they are further toward the back or front
help 2019-10-27 17:47:13 or just use keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 18:31:01 you know shit's getting real when a video with this thumbnail is posted
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 18:31:40 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 18:32:03 that was unintentional but whatever <:rickshrug:637030733877084200>
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 18:35:34 well
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 18:35:42 if they explode
bug-reports 2019-10-27 19:27:16 no just fix it
creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:53:36 no minimodding please
creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:53:49 although someone capable of building that is probably >13 lol
creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:56:30 ..
creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:56:47 can't we just appreciate the actual rocket
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:03:18 the thing i don't get
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:03:36 is why you guys care about banning unde's so much, especially if they build well
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:04:08 it's hardly like discord hires undercover agents to go in the hundreds of thousands of large discord servers to find out which ones don't ban <13's
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:04:44 no, that wasn't the point
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:05:01 the point was that you're so desperate to find them all lol
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:05:37 i wasn't talking about you specifically
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:06:30 the first thing i saw was the stupid creeper
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:06:50 can i have a rant?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:31 i hate how people post builds and get huge amounts of upvotes just because the builds reference some sort of popular culture(eg: minecraft). these builds are never judged on how they LOOK unless they look absolutely terrible. it's particularly bad with minecraft because you can basically just copy a block, pixel to fucking pixel, and get loads of upvotes
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:50 and don't get me started
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:52 on meme builds
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:31 yah they look nice
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:46 might be able to use a bit more colour variation and contrast though
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:53 imo
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:10:36 i suggest at least different shades of gray
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:10:59 since it's hard to emphasise on the detail with just 1-3 similar shades
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:11:47 the plot was blue and we very rarely get other people's creations posted here
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:11:56 there just isn't much point, it looks better cropped anyways
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:34:54 don't post unfinished creations here please
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:35:10 rather <#478584971670454284> if you want advice and <#384021699466756107> to flex
general 2019-10-27 20:37:37 looks cool
general 2019-10-27 20:38:01 i'm shit at drawing, wanted to be a graphics designer at one point then gave up <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:38:27 wow, really nice
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:38:31 i love the detail on that
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:38:39 your own design?
general 2019-10-27 20:38:46 no clue
general 2019-10-27 20:38:50 i might go into mathematics
general 2019-10-27 20:38:59 coding and machine learning really interest me
general 2019-10-27 20:39:16 yeah
general 2019-10-27 20:39:30 well, thing is that maths and programming ties extremely well into machine learning
general 2019-10-27 20:39:50 since most modern algorithms are actually just really big, complicated functions
general 2019-10-27 20:40:18 talktotransformertwo
general 2019-10-27 20:40:29 i can make a second oracle
general 2019-10-27 20:40:35 and write a new new testament

creations-chat 2019-10-27 21:09:22 <#609442446249820211> for reference, you need a certain number of upvotes

Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 21:54:52 Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain, we can be like they are
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 21:55:10 wait ima put this through talktotransformer aka motor oracle
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 21:56:41 All our times have come
So we get on our knees
And pray, pray, pray
Just do it, take my hand, take my hand
All the times have come
And the reaper will surely hear
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 21:57:39 There are many in the world who wish the same
It doesn't matter, we will fly our way through the sky
Take my hand, don't fear the reaper
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid,
Don't let this be our farewell, we will fly our way through the sky
I'm only doing what I can
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 21:58:40 So long to live, it never seems so long
And we'll be able to love in the long run
And we'll be able to live
And we'll be able to die, baby
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 22:00:42 The sound of the wind will break
Don't fear the motor
The wind will blow, don't fear the motor
Don't fear the motor, we'll be able to fly
Here but now they're gone
Rickje don't feel the motor
The air is still, so we're in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 22:02:11 uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 22:02:12 Rickje, you'll never fly No way
An airplane I'm flying is not flying
Rickje, you'll never fly no more But it's here, it's here
Rickje the wind blows
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 22:02:19 fuck this isn't the dump
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:02:56 I won't be able to control my mind
Finkl takes my hand, don't fear the motor
Rickje can be so wild and wild
Finkl takes my hand, don't fear the motor
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:03:06 This is the real you I know

the-dump 2019-10-27 22:06:12 This is what your face looks like
The sky's black as a midnight sea Rickje's face is still a picture of hope
The skies are black tonight, the sky is black tonight I've done a thousand things you have never done Rickje must go on
The world is dark and full of darkness
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:09:48 I know what's coming

Rickje's still

Finkl's a fucking loser
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:11:14 They're all in the same boat

the-dump 2019-10-27 22:17:16 Rickje is the one to win the game

Madattak's only fault is that

he's dumb and stupid

The world is falling apart
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:17:29 So it was with the world

that Rickje fought

and he fell, he went through

his heart and he felt

the heart of every single living thing

He cried as he saw them lose

Rickje knew this was it

All the worlds went

the world would go under

Rickje watched it go

and he knew it was over
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:18:03 Rickje is the last one

He says "I think you should flee"

He makes a run for it

I think I think it's pretty scary now
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:18:07 ...

the United States will be destroyed

it will happen soon

it'll be amazing

its happening here

we are the ones that do this

we're the puppets
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:20:05 it's getting

plane-crazy 2019-10-28 22:40:17 community in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 22:40:28 yes please
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 22:42:28 [GUITAR INTRO]

VERSE 1
Welcome unde, to plane crazy
Here we build stupid things
Using massively broken blocks
That rick is unable to fix

My frames per second are dying
And three people crashed
Just let me build for god's sake
I don't need your crap

[KEY CHANGE TO RELATIVE MINOR]

PRE-CHORUS (buildup/development)
There was a time in my life
When it wasn't quite like this
The game's seen better days
A friendlier phase
The community used to be good

Then one day mad woke up
Two thousand players online
The curse of popularity
Perhaps prosperity
Was upon us

And from that moment on
The games golden age
Was over

[PITCH GETS HIGHER]

CHORUS
So here we are now, livin' with modern plane crazy
And I don't know how, but somehow motors are still broken
While we can live it for now, one day they'll come back for revenge
So pray, oh pray, to the motor god

[INSTRUMENTS DROP AGAIN]

VERSE 2
That's a chonky 747
And a generic F15
Please learn to use wedges
For the sake of this community

Sakura built another swashplate
Time to flex it everywhere
How the thing works I don't know
But it's cool so I don't care

[KEY CHANGE TO RELATIVE MINOR]

PRE-CHORUS (buildup/development)
There was a time in my life
When it wasn't quite like this
The game's seen better days
A friendlier phase
The community used to be good

Then one day mad woke up
Two thousand players online
The curse of popularity
Perhaps prosperity
Was upon us

And from that moment on
The games golden age
Was over

[PITCH GETS HIGHER]

CHORUS
So here we are now, livin' with modern plane crazy
And I don't know how, but somehow motors are still broken
While we can live it for now, one day they'll come back for revenge
So pray, oh pray, to the motor god

[INSTRUMENT SOLO OVER NEXT SECTION]

CHORUS EXTENSION
ohhhh to the motor god
yes, to the motor god
ohhhh to the motor god
yes, to the motor god

[SLOWLY FADES]

ohhhh to the motor god
yes, to the motor god
ohhhh to the motor god
yes, to the motor god

general 2019-10-29 22:40:52 thank
the-dump 2019-10-29 22:42:59 <@!238017332872478720> HOLY FUCK YOU STILL HAVE THAT PICTURE?
the-dump 2019-10-29 22:43:03 i totally forgot
the-dump 2019-10-29 22:43:06 about that
the-dump 2019-10-29 22:43:16 
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:44:43 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:45:53 i hate it when people build references from popular culture to get upvotes, copying practically pixel to pixel instead of actually trying to make even *remotely* their own idea and detail
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:46:23 also can i just say this is a fucking great concept
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:46:31 from <#384025409945337856>
general 2019-10-29 22:46:49 no
general 2019-10-29 22:46:53 ic
general 2019-10-29 22:46:55 e
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:47:15 i'm guessing he coloured them white and the body black
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:47:22 then put very bright lights on
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:47:35 but i do know some materials have light absorbing properties
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:47:39 like glass for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:00 you literally just copied the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:06 it's nothing more than blatant copying
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:22 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:38 but no effort, really. absolutely zero creative effort
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:43 none of your **own design**
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:49 and that is what plane crazy is about
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:48:56 or at least the contests
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:49:02 yes, i am
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:49:08 but not exactly that in this context
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:49:43 i mean that when you replicate, you *usually* make your own details and it takes skill and time to actually build nicely
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:49:54 but **anyone** could blatantly copy that from minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:50:10 although yes i do like to chew people up for not making unique build :>
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:50:14 because creativity good
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:50:38 shut up ac
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:50:43 ah
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:50:44 yes

plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:57:11

plane-crazy 2019-10-29 22:57:56 
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:05 i feel like i wrote this when i was drunk
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:18 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:32 but it feels like i was when i read that thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:33 nah
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:39 i had 3 cups today
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:56 ooooooo
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:58 aaaaAAA
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:00:59 And I don't know how, but somehow motors are still broken
While we can live it for now, one day they'll come back for revenge
So pray, oh pray, to the motor god
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:01:07 OHHHH MOTOR
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:01:08 YES
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:01:48 *doesn't die*
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:02:08 Prayer is not enough
A prayer is not enough
I will kill my own kids in the name of the motor god
So pray, oh pray, to the motor god, that you may find him
When my mother died I did not cry, I did not even cry!
After her death I prayed for the motor god for a long time and I got very mad.
The motor god took my father away for a short time
And I do not like it when the motor god takes people away. I wanted him to stay, I wanted him to protect my brother and I, I loved him.
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:02:21 neural network getting dark again

plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:02:25 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:03:26 With the world turned upside down, we are your pawns
Piece by piece I'm getting out of here
The clock is ticking down
I'm ready to die
Oh do the little people in my world
Do what they said they wouldn't
Don't you get it? you must obey
You know it, you feel it
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:04:09 And if my wife ever goes missing we shall know
We shall know that the thing in the sky
That's so big
Will come crashing down
And it'll just kill it all
So pray, oh pray, to the motor god
That we are still alive.
And you are my family
If you die, you'll all die
And so, pray, oh pray, to the motor god

plane-crazy 2019-10-30 23:12:25 simply respect the rules and don't actively hate on furries. if you cause any arguments you will be held responsible. ok?
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 23:15:46 jesus STOP
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 23:16:45 you can have an opinion. you can't spew it in this server where you are bound to start an argument soon enough. please just keep any controversial opinions to yourself, not everyone here agrees and not everyone here will respect you for that
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 23:16:59 we just don't want any massive arguments
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 23:17:47 yes, but preventation is better than the cure

bot-central 2019-10-31 20:57:06 ?
bot-central 2019-10-31 20:57:18 of *course* not
plane-crazy 2019-10-31 22:17:56 ok let me tell you about something. we had a member(will go unnamed) who was eventually banned for unrelated reasons, who was very into furries. and people CONSTANTLY tried to start beef with them and it resulted in huge arguments in <#497142796961054721> weekly with mutes, sometimes even bans being handed out left and right, mods engaged in screaming matches, memes being spammed. people feel strongly about their opinions and i do not want a repeat of this - no one does. this is why i am asking you to keep your opinions about furries to yourself. i am not trying to opress your opinion or something like that. so please for the sake of the server and the mods' peace of mind, just don't. alright?

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 08:32:30 Well?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 08:32:49 I'll just drop a warn
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 08:33:25 K I'm out
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 08:33:29 Alreaey late
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:17:23 so like
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:17:25 this?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:18:04 what about this
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:18:32 the colours tho?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:18:35 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:18:54 do you mean less variety, less contrast...?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:22:50 i see what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:23:15 but sometimes it's hard to build detailed and use less colours because it just hides the detail
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:23:40 idk next time i'll probably do like 2 colour schemes, one using 'less colour' and see which one people prefer
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:26:01 no
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:26:03 you're not
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:26:12 why would pinging rick do ANYTHING in this scenario
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:26:16 he already knows about it ;p
creations-chat 2019-11-01 16:27:39 done
creations-chat 2019-11-01 16:27:40 np
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:28:04 you still don't need to ping him about it -_-
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:28:27 just because it happened ONCE does not mean it's 'back' ;p
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:28:31 yes
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:32:09 ok how about
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:32:17 from now on only rick warns for pinging rick
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:32:23 to avoid this
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:32:26 sort of thing
bug-reports 2019-11-01 16:32:56 but he'll have been pinged anyways

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:42:16 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:42:21 *doesn't die*
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:42:33 I WILL NOT STAND
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:42:35 FOR THIS
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:42:37 NONSENSE
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:54:47 your epic idea has already been suggested a ton. the reason it wouldn't be the best idea is because i have seen it abused a LOT, people just spam 'SAY !VOTEKICK RICKJE139' and everyone does the same. plus, people would just kick people with large builds for 'lag' which is besides the point
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:57:04 people can play the game
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:57:06 ;_;
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:57:24 and yeah, people would just votekick others with good pvp vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:57:35 there is a reason that most pvp games don't have votekick system
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:58:09 the lag isn't something you will find in basically ANY public servers because people never build anything big
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:58:15 so it is your computer's problem
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:59:04 do you want to fight
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 16:07:25 
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 16:07:30 slightly more context
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 16:07:49 i don't even bother designing turrets
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 16:08:03 just build weird dystopian shit

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 16:58:46 i think it may have been more to do with the 10k part exploding reactor nearby
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:11:29 it's the un de filter
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:25:06 noteblocks would be cool with wiring/logic gates

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:28:34 i tried that
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:28:37 and my game crashed
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:28:42 and someone else's as well
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:28:44 7 times in fact
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:28:55 actually come to think of it
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:29:01 i'm not sure if I tried with the new magnets
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:29:06 i'll have another go rq
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:32:21 tryna modify the core so it works with magnets
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:32:32 and yes rick removed the lag on magnets
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:32:42 well not removed
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:32:44 but minimised
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:34:11 your magnet placement is weird as well
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:35:55 ok so apparently fucking notepad++ deleted the file with all the reactor controls
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:35:58 ughhhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:39:57 HOLY FUCK IT DIDN'T CRASH
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:40:03 HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:49:56 well i got it working, kinda
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 17:55:52 it works but it's too laggy to be worth it even as it is

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:13:07 i just want to
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:13:24 oh wait i remember now, i want to set them as desktop background

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:32:38 fire away
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:32:53 i mean

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:33:04 and wanted to 'render' it
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:33:23 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:33:38 how do you mean
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:34:25 btw I have photoshop but I can't use adobe's rendering software because frankly my gpu is so outdated it can't run the required graphics engine
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:34:44 i did a bit of research, couldn't find a way around it
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:34:46 it might have been cpu
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:34:49 i'm not sure
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:35:00 i have an integrated gpu but i'm not sure exactly what stats
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:35:05 an i3 processor
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:35:17 not sure, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:35:39 wait, wdym by flatten?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:36:20 rendered in some way. i'm absolutely not familiar with rendering
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:36:27 which is why I came to ask
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:36:55 no idea, what types are there?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:36:59 sorry, really new to this
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:37:13 i had a look around on the internet but there was literally nothing
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:37:28 i mean like, you know
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:37:29 hold on a sec
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:37:52 
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:37:56 obviously not exactly like that
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:38:04 but the lighting effects for instance
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:40:23 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:41:08 wait, wdym text?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:41:20 could you direct me to the software you use for this stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:42:07 ok ok hang on. so you're actually interpolating frames using two images or?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:42:32 my cpu is a 3rd gen btw, just found that
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:42:55 also, i have photoshop but don't know how I can use it for rendering
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:43:18 3rd gen i3 FTW <:DabOnEm:520022237705928704>
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:43:39 it runs minecraft 256 mods at about 30fps
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:43:43 depending on the optimization
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:43:53 it's quadcore
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:43:56 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:44:00 in most cases
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:44:34 wait. 30fps is HIGH
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:44:38 for my pc
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:44:52 i always close all other apps, task manager everything i can find, etc
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:45:03 graphics settings lowest
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:45:27 if no big shit is going on, about 40fps, if big shit is going in which it usually is, 5-15
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:49:59 ?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:50:42 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:51:36 aight nvm i found another solution
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:57:06 before
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:57:10 after
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:57:16 hmph
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:57:21 not exactly great
creations-chat 2019-11-03 14:59:06 Welcome to the IDRACORE™ reactor. This smaller-than-average reactor supplies power to the nearby motor research lab(owned by FINKL™). The project took 6 years in total to plan and build, and now runs 24/7, supplying excess power to nearby towns. 

Information about the inner workings of this reactor are classified, but we assure you having the turbines and the reactor in the same room is perfectly safe in this case.

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:45:30 that's not how
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:45:34 you play the fucking game
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:46:23 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:46:42 nope nope fucking nope
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:46:43 i'm out
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:07:19 <@456226577798135808> no
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:07:32 oh, about logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:07:53 you can make anologue gates yourself but they are bulky, not standardized and most of all you can't connect them to anything
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:08:23 we want logic gates that can connect to engines, motors etc and are compact and easy to use
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:08:29 it would enable a LOT of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:08:35 not just calculators
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:09:29 :_: i couldn't resist it
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:09:37 no pls
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:09:51 people dm me asking for build to be put in HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:09:55 and i dm'ed myself
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:10:22 i went through r.votetop some time ago to find anything worthy of hof not already there
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:10:24 didn't find much
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:10:42 mostly just stupid meme builds...

bot-central 2019-11-04 20:14:41 are you stupid
bot-central 2019-11-04 20:14:50 ?modlogs <@!339519624968404993>
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:07 finally found it
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:13 it's ugly but rules are rules
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:16 also
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:22 if you want your build in hall of fame
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:24 ASK FOR IT!!
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:47 i don't go through the entirety of creations every day
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:55 30 is the threshold
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:17:57 -_-
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:18:04 and?#
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:18:13 what hecc
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:18:29 pics
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:20:13 nope
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:20:26 also uh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:20:41 we don't get anywhere NEAR enough creations, especially good ones, to go on <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:20:49 we'd have like 3 builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:21:35 *in your opinion*
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:21:39 not saying i agree or disagree
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:22:03 no they can't
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:22:06 bruh
creations-chat 2019-11-04 20:22:42 <rant>
1) not enough creations are posted here to 'flood the channel' and smother other images to any bad extent
2) people like to show you DIFFERENT ANGLES. A build often looks very different from other angles
3) people sometimes spend a LOT of time on the creations posted here and don't want to let all that effort go to waste
4) just because your tripod can be shown with 1 angle doesn't mean every creation can

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:24:36 just ate a fucking soft grape

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:01 the detail is minimalistic but the structure is very well thought out
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:06 yeah, well
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:09 it's an oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:13 it's blocky...
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:33 what??? i never said i disagreed with you bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:39 ^
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:29:55 aight, fine, your opinion
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:09 yes that should be in HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:16 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:24 oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:36 do you know the message with it or user?
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:59 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:32:59 why did you get it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:33:12 ok yeah that should definitely not be in HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 20:33:17 voxel put it in
creations-chat 2019-11-04 21:00:14 TRUC
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:03:58 <@!608820687334801414> can you not
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:04:00 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:05:10 ?mute
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:05:11 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:40:28 easier said than done
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:40:34 but yes would be epic as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:40:57 the problem is that the game tends to fuck a lot of stuff up when you modify a few parameters
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:41:02 it's hardcoded
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:41:18 the parameters are set, they aren't calculated on other paramters
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:41:31 so changing one thing breaks many others
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:42:14 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:42:15 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:42:20 more like 8 months
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:42:28 it took mad 6 months to write the base code

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:44:22 brb
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:44:22 tea time
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:44:39 as a *compromise*
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:44:42 here's a suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:45:45 **As a compromise, we could have single-player servers where players can spawn as many builds as they want, so you could use magnets and weld a bunch of parts together.**
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 21:52:52 why is chrome cursed

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 21:59:09 context - i offered a bunch of suggestions for the server to be cleaned up. i argued with an extremely stupid admin about it for about 2 hours and we got nowhere. then the next day, some other admin comes online, i mention my proposed reforms to him and he basically goes and does them straight away. extremely stupid admin is pissed and mostly stays quiet. another admin who was also arguing(one in the picture) decided that the server was now messy because some channels were merged and decided to pull an angsty teenager and 'took a break from the server'
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 21:59:16 ah yes, fun
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 21:59:55 so yeah, i screwed with the admins extremely badly

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:14:15 heck
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:03 just add new map
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:13 rick some people want to build a map for you
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:35 
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:38 this is some guy's plan
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:41 henkku's
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:20:57 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:21:00 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:21:01 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:21:42 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:21:46 rick what do you think?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:21:54 if this map was built, would you add it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:22:38 how come?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:23:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:23:40 add a sky island
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:23:43 and a spawn on there
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:23:48 ^
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:23:49 or that
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:22:33 _ _
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:23:06 ok @vixoo
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:23:22 shut up coffee
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:23:31 literally bean soup smh
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:25:13 ew
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:25:13 at least it isn't bean water
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:25:24 imagine drinking soggy beans
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:51:06 thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:51:28 how's colouring? i was told i should use less colours so only 3 in this build
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:51:47 mothership/spaceship of some sort
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:52:08 i take that as a good thing ;D
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:52:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:52:42 vixo, constructive criticism please
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:52:46 shut up noob
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:53:07 what do you actually think about it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:54:51 yeah, it definitely wouldn't... where would you suggest putting it? should I build wings off the sides or expand the main body, or just generally use more wedges/half blocks etc?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:55:31 i'm male but have a slightly female personality
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:56:45 i'm thinking i expand it like this
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:17:42 i updated it <@!614036643120152587> what do you think now?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:18:44 yeah, lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:27:34 how's it now
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:28:04 mothership/starship of some sort
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:28:39 a lot
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:28:42 it's a mining ship
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:28:44 in theory
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:29:51 the ore is sent directly to the processing section in the middle where it is refined and compressed under extremely high temperatures and pressures, then sent to storage right at the back
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:29:53 radiators
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:31:14 the ship has a laser running through the centre front, which it directs at asteroids and planets with extremely high precision in orbit. the laser is run by an algorithm that calculates all vectors needed, then cuts a very very precise hole of the highest possible efficiency before tractor beaming the ore back into the ship
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:04 the ore is processed in an IRSU that turns most substrates into fuel that is burned by the plasma engines
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:06 uh
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:11 the ore is mined from asteroids
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:13 in orbit
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:21 the ship matches their orbit then mines them
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:33:22 anywhere
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:34:09 there are currently 7 of these ships deployed around ceres, 17 in the asteroid belt around a large processing mothership and 3 around mars
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:35:23 ore is transported to Earth through massive freighter ships that circulate the solar system every year or two stopping at each major station or being intercepted by smaller freighters to offload their cargo.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:35:52 who's that?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:37:24 the radiators are necassary at the front to cool the laser, since its extremely high power means it can only run for a few seconds before having to cool down. the back radiators are to cool the constantly-running relatively high-power plasma ion engines
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:37:44 and... hmm
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:38:05 the ship is operated remotely by human controllers at a nearby station
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:38:13 but has autonomous capability if needed
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:38:30 oh yeah energy
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:38:32 i forgot about that
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:40:45 energy is relayed to the ship from a station equipped with a fusion reactor. you would think it more efficient to use solar energy, but the ship often operates so far from the sun that solar energy is very inefficient. engineers decided to use a relay system to supply the ships with energy(though they have backup batteries) and advanced computer monitoring systems to prevent occlusion
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:41:08 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:41:12 i think that does it for lore
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:42:50 ono
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:45:11 spooky
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:46:46 honestly probably not gonna watch it, because I always get envious and go to make my own video, then roblox runs at 5fps, so i try to find frame interpolation software, which doesn't work in the end, so i give up and go to bed
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:47:25 yeah, he has a good PC
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:47:27 i don't
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:47:36 purified
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:47:43 i have a fucking 3rd gen i3
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:47:56 laptop
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:04 integrated GPU
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:06 ye
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:08 very bad
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:17 it was good quality when i got it, but now outdated
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:35 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:37 ASAP
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:48:52 i do have 4 cores though, maybe it'll help when roblox drops multithreading
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:49:02 since it only runs on 1
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:49:53 go read the rules -_-

plane-crazy 2019-11-08 22:53:45 no you won't
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 22:54:17 i built a neural network security algorithm and had white hats hired to through malware at it and patch up all weaknesses they could find
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 22:54:31 throw* ugh my english dying today
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 22:56:34 i'm not giving you any more money. not a single penny.
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:01:51 that's actually not a bad point
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:01:59 yeah wtf i don't want to be gen z anymore
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:02:21 imagine in the future -
"ok fortnite boy"
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:02:33 Z
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:03:30 can i just say
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:03:36 modern pop music absolute fucking shit
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:03:46 vixo that's not even funny any more ._.
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:04:15 literally vocal and drums and if you're lucky a bass
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:04:39 few, i'm normal Z
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:04:50 PHEW*
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:04:57 god wtf is going on with my english
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:05:27 modern music is statistically getting worse actually
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:05:33 that was said by a neural network
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:05:45 trained on data from now and 1920's onwards
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:05:49 with dates
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:06:39 apparently choruses are getting closer to the start of the song because it grabs peoples attention, textures are getting way thinner, note ranges way lower, rhythms simpler
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:06:46 *statistically*
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:06:59 don't fucking mention rap
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:05 that shit is not actual music
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:09 so idk why we should mention it
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:11 in a discussion
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:13 about music
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:38 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:07:56 u like 🅱 owie?
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:08:14 mozart fairly good tbh
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:08:28 some of his compositions are ehh imo, but that's just my taste
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:08:43 #bringbackgoodmusicandnotfuckingrapffs
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 23:09:12 what [2]
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 12:55:37 i get the feeling
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 12:55:40 rick needs a bit of help
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:02:11 don't detail big builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:02:16 detail small sections of big builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:02:23 as you go
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:02:46 don't force yourself into detailing the whole things, it sometimes just overwhelms you
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:03:04 yeah, small builds defo easier to detail and play around with
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:03:28 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:03:53 yeah, looks fairly good
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:03:56 nose is nice
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:05:04 i like to detail sections as I build
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:05:26 so i'll build a part of the whole thing, like the nose for instance, then I'll play around with it to see what looks best
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:06:02 then once the build is finished/nearly finished i'll often sit back and have a look at the whole thing and think about which sections look the weirdest
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:41:36 what is going on here
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 13:41:53 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 14:08:22 <#495286269459300364> check

plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:28:49 done**
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:03 rank purge was reform of system
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:08 old one was less organized
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:28 no one builds trains anymore
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:32 so we didn;t bother
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:45 idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:29:46 ask rick
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:31:53 btw i was the one who reformed most of the ranks, if you have complaints dm me
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:32:40 blackbird you'd be on it, shush
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 18:43:36 kdone
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 20:45:37 robo's problem
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:27:47 is this ok for the front of a blimp
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:28:08 /airship
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:28:31 is it OK tho
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:29:35 yeah, would be too flat
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:29:46 it might look ok if i build the whole thing in the same style
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:29:48 ?
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:39:05 aight, how's this?

You guys are all idiots and have no clue about anything except making your friends miserable at work. The only thing I can offer you is the same advice I've given so many other people and I will gladly give you my money when it's time to sell. I just can't be around you anymore.

That's just how it is. You can always tell when someone is serious about wanting to sell your company or an idea: they write to you. They write to everyone. It's a tactic. You want people to think that you're serious about your company/idea? Write to them.

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 04:35:48 The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, also known as Pastafarians, was created in San Francisco in 2007 by atheist blogger Andrew Torrez. A small group of people then began to meet in the city's Mission District, in what was then a predominantly Catholic neighborhood.

The group of believers was small at first, but has grown to about 15,000 believers, with several hundred living in the U.S., and tens of thousands worldwide. Pastafarians believe that a Flying Spaghetti Monster exists. They also believe that their deity created life on Earth and that the Bible is the only true book of scripture.

Atheists have called for Torrez to be fired from his job at the church, but he has refused, saying his blog has a free-speech right. The Church is currently suing him

He exists without beginning or end and exists in all places at all times. He is not necessarily benevolent; He is not necessarily omniscient; He is not necessarily omnipotent. The only requirement for membership in The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is that you have a strong belief in His existence. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but we encourage you to be as respectful and considerate of the Flying Spaghetti Monster as you can.

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 04:38:27 CHURCH OF THE BROKEN GOD

The Church of the Broken God is one of the five major religious sects of the Commonwealth. It is also the only sect to have a name, The Temple of the Broken God.

The Church of the Broken God worships a god named the Broken God. They worship him as if he were alive, which was the result of his followers, including those in the Commonwealth, being unable to control him after the War. The Temple of the Broken God consists of the Broken God, his followers and their followers as well as a number of other cult members who worship him in their own way. They have many different locations around the Commonwealth where they hold meetings, rituals and worship ceremonies.

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 04:42:42 Majic: The Broken God is the greatest of all. He is the one that created this world and we live on his plane. He is the one that is the source of all that is good in the universe, for without him there would be no life. He created all that is good and created this universe. But the way he did it, it was all a mistake. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He did not need to create a universe, for without a universe there would be no life. He created life with his magic, and he was in the right place at the right time. But as a result of that, the world went bad. He created a world of pain, and it is his fault that it has come to this. But the most important part of the story is that he is also in the wrong place at the wrong time. The story of his creation is the true story of creation.

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:33:02 ew
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:33:23 fahrenheit is basically just nonsense
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:33:56 Celsius is better because it starts at 0, the point where water freezes, and goes through 100, the point where water boils
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:01 it's
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:02 logical
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:11 considering our weather systems revolve around water
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:32 also water has differing boiling points because of other molecules and shit inside it
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:41 pure water? 100
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:44 *c
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:35:59 feet are confusing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:10 inches confusinger
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:16 centimetres are good
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:42 100 centimetres a metre, 1000 metres a kilometre

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:28 it's x10 x100 x1000 for mm cm km
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:34 FEET ARE CONFUSING
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:39 x10
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:40 x100
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:42 x1000
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:38:06 you say 'saved from Britain' like it's a good thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:06 your system is fucking irrelevant
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:22 we use mainly metric
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:32 i admit that combining it with imperial for mph is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:40 it should be kmh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:42 gtg
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:42 ah fuck

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:14:18 he's
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:14:20 integex
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:14:23 that's why
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:14:52 ok so basically, integex,
a person who liked to flaunt their ego and flex on people and constantly caused beef with the moderation team and always called for "mod abuse" whenever he got warned or muted, no matter what, and he purposefully tried to argue with the mod team
and overall literally does not really care
also trying to intentionally stir things up

//orangeskii
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:15:19 well he had about 50 modlogs
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 22:15:51 extend?

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:18 FUCK
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:19 microsoft are murdering
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:21 snipping tool
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:37 I AM FUCKING BOYCOTTING THE NEXT UPDATE
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:44 BECAUSE MICROSOFT
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:45 ARE BAD
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:50:47 grrr
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:51:13 
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:51:24 snip and sketch is just
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:51:25 ugh
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:51:29 slow and annoying
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:51:35 controls are counter intuitive
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:12 like this is just
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:14 why
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:16 WHY
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:34 this is
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:35 SO MUCH NICER
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:40 YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:49 -collapses-
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:52:52 -crying-
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:53:02 no i know what it means
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:53:04 it's just dumb
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:53:31 the other one is just way more compact, easier to use
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:53:49 because why not just have a mode selection tool like snipping tool
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:54:12 it's also bad for when you need to quickly take a snip
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:54:26 i could do it in <2-3 seconds with snipping tool, including startup
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:54:55 and this fucking thing takes >5 seconds on my computer to start, then you have to press the snip tool
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:55:20 which takes about 0.3 seconds, JUST enough to make me start taking the snip already
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:55:35 <0.5 of mine
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:55:41 on
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:56:11 that's not the fucking **point**
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:56:19 it's just badly optimised compared to snipping tool
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:56:22 it's relative
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:57:10 your pc probably isn't terrible
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:57:16 i have a 3rd gen i3 btw
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:57:23 i'm comparing start speeds
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:57:41 relatively. not in terms of 'this slow bruh'
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:57:49 lemme google that
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 17:58:50 just popped up for me
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:19:31 why do we want moon rocks -.-
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:19:48 ^

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:07:52 is it not obvious that i'm not trying to replicate a design
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:07 as opposed to
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:09 this though
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:26 no other way to do it
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:38 what?
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:50 because i'm
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 20:08:52 building it onto something

creations-chat 2019-11-23 13:24:23 The largest starship in this style I've ever finished. 1855 blocks and held up by helium, it's capable of manoeuvring to some extent through snow blasters.

general 2019-11-23 18:48:21 ok so how many CPU's and how many cores do i have?
general 2019-11-23 18:48:23 i'm confused as shit
general 2019-11-23 18:48:59 
general 2019-11-23 18:56:40 heck, idek
general 2019-11-23 18:56:52 i just started getting some weird FPS stutters and decreases
general 2019-11-23 18:56:56 and lots of crashing
general 2019-11-23 18:57:29 oh, always thought it had 4 cores
general 2019-11-23 18:57:34 never bothered to look it up
general 2019-11-23 18:57:53 it's a pretty shitty CPU tbh
general 2019-11-23 18:57:58 overall
general 2019-11-23 18:58:09 3rd gen i3 tho ;/
general 2019-11-23 18:58:59 definitely have. it's a pretty old laptop too, 7+ years, idk exactly
general 2019-11-23 18:59:33 yes, that should make sense
general 2019-11-23 18:59:46 sounds about right
general 2019-11-23 19:00:30 i probably will soon, lol
general 2019-11-23 19:00:58 but I still want that stuttering fixed
general 2019-11-23 19:01:06 running intel diagnostics on it rn
general 2019-11-23 19:02:17 can it actually be downgraded to windows 7 or 8?
general 2019-11-23 19:02:25 there's no way to do that, right?
general 2019-11-23 19:03:50 would it actually help? I thought 10 was more optimized
general 2019-11-23 19:05:40 I will probs do some more research into that, thanks
general 2019-11-23 19:06:21 Fucking microsoft -,-
general 2019-11-23 19:06:35 They are murdering even the children

plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:17:51 <@!441756332610289673> what seems to be the problem
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:12 you can
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:15 press RTY
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:36 well that sucks
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:39 :]
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:18:58 use your imagination
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:19:11 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:19:14 let me explain why
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:21:51 the game was originally coded by madattak and it was coded as a hobby, basically. it wasn't actually meant to go anywhere. as a result, he coded it so that factors would not change when other factors were tweaked - so if one variable is changed it often breaks the whole game. then the game got popular as fucking shit and development was taken over by rickje139. rickje139 just adds new blocks and tweaks surface parameters and so on, but is unable to actually tweak any deeper aspects of the game. the game was never intended to go this far, so it doesn't have those properties of flexibility. <@!441756332610289673>
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:22:29 did you read it?

plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:42:04 he made a server with about 50 NSFW channels just to trashtalk noctua after causing a riot in this channel, invited katze and a TON of people from this server, started spamming up the nsfw channels
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:42:13 it was a huge mess
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:43:01 channels...
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:43:22 it was obviously an exaggeration, what's your problem?

plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:43:45 ok, let's not discuss the details
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:44:36 the thing that's astonished me through all of this is how ridiculously easy it is to stirr up a riot
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:44:43 doesn't even matter what your cause is

plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:18:41 we have a thing, unlike you, called a life
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:19:03 usually i'm just a ping away but i was AFK at that point ;/
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:19:26 also starting to move to other servers because this one's... not to my taste
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:19:59 i would have left long ago tbh but i couldn't find anywhere else
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:50:09 your map might be put into the game
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:50:10 idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:50:27 no i didn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:51:38 i'm not going to give contest winner if it's for something that doesn't even need you to play the game.
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:51:53 contest winner is for contests on this server in <#504718138399522832>
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:51:58 because roborail
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:52:02 i didn't decide that
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:52:16 i did tell you i was done with those contests, didn't I
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:53:33 don't participate if you don't want to is the solution
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:55:37 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:56:04 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:56:19 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:56:23 it used to be
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:57:01 as you would know, no one actually builds decent original builds anymore
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:57:06 that probably
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:57:54 you can get it if you impress the mods sufficiently
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:58:00 but so far, no one really has
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:58:30 nah just no one builds good original builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:58:51 idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 15:00:14 idk, depends what the whole mod team thought
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 15:00:48 personally i'd say no because it isn't all that interesting design and isn't that big
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 15:00:57 literally what turbo said
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 15:02:10 it's been tripping for like 50 years

plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:13:28 yes you can but they're a bit awkward to use
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:13:32 and take up 1x3 space
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:14:42 fuckin ball conveyors ftw
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:15:00 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:15:08 copper + tin

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:01:12 no, it's a generic fps and i don't like that 😦
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:46:16 
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:47:26 yah, they're kinda boring imo
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:52:03 GYS
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:52:05 I MADE DUK
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:57:57 pvp meta needs to be fixed first
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:58:06 right now it's just tiny little no-effort planes with guns
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:58:09 and turrets
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:58:23 that respawn as soon as you kill them as if nothing happened at all
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:58:49 ^
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:05:41 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:06:05 and that is why the neutronic pull of the mitochondric black hole force is the magnesium substrate capable electron
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:07:17 oh, good point
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:07:53 but could it not be averted by applying photovoltaic bombardment of alpha rays through a colligable fullerene capsule?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:08:20 did you mean
*aggressive artillery noises*
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:08:28 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:08:29 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:09:11 we could fix this by calculating the derivative of the function of the magnesium substrate transpiration effect
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:09:21 and applying it
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:09:29 to the quadratic cost function
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:10:01 search 'folding tutorial' on youtube
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:10:04 plenty of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:10:10 better explained visually
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:10:17 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:10:54 no, the interaction with the contributors would be purely static, and no quantum dynamic changes could fluctuate their output
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:11:08 so while there may be a slight stutter, overall production shoulod be fine
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:12:08 yes, but if we take the integral of the point slope intercept form we can see there is a correlation with the radial interaction of a sine wave
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:12:50 this is, of course, known as the calculatic sig integrederiv
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:14:12 because if we do not properly apply the backpropagation algorithm to the nodes in layer 6 there may be a too negligible adjustment to weights in layer 5 and 6
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:14:40 AND THIS IS WHY THE RICKJIC CALCULATIC FORMULA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THE CHAIN RULE.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:15:37 ALL THIS CAN BE DRAWN ONTO A GRAPH AND WE CAN GATHER THE DERIVATIVES AT THE INTERCEPT AND MULTIPLY THEM IN ORDER TO GAIN THE TORQUE ROTARY FORCE GAIN.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:15:48 IUGIYFTYFTY
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:18:14 more specifically, the non-linear prime correlation between torque and fucking brokness
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:18:39 yah
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:20:12 well, yes, but according to the chain rule if we multiply together all the derivatives of the variables that affect the brokenness of a motor with respect to the torque, we should be able to calculate one variable of the brokenness equation
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:22:32 nah, we would need to wrap a sigmoid around the fundamental factors in order to normalize the output, then we can take the derivative
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:22:59 we then multiply by a random number from 1 to 43856238765347826 in order to simulate roblox physics
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:23:02 solved
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:23:19 i think i just summed up roblox physics in a sentence
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:24:24 it would solve some
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:24:49 but to get overall performance factor we will need to find the integrals of the sine wave generated by rotational motor output
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:25:05 which turns out to be pi * r ^2
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:25:20 where r is width of the motor
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:25:57 my record since i can remember is about 20 hours
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:26:12 i have the 💪 sleep
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:26:34 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:26:35 why
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:26:40 why would you do that
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:30:35 this just popped up on my recommendations
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:30:38 haven't even searched for plane crazy shit in the last month
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:30:40 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:31:35 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:32:25 i'm bored
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:32:31 anyone play factorio? realm of the mad god?

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:38:11 why the fuck does everyone know my real-life name?

Welcome to Reddit, where that doesn't happen. Your attention span will likely end up being long enough to make you forget where you are or how long you have been there. But if you're going to set foot in this land of degenerates, the Reddit hive mind is going to be too much of an intrusion to ignore. The promise of subreddits like r/golang, r/kelloggs and r/techsupport is that your most obscure questions will be answered.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:39:19 why the fuck does everyone know my real-life name? is this a big deal or what?

Pat.

Like I said, fuck you sir.

Perhaps if I decided not to find it boring and I made it a bonus, that might earn me a bit more respect.

But as it stands, I will have to make do with the shorter version. I've been known to confuse and upset the "useful idiots."
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:39:47 leak it
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:40:36 Idra: why the fuck does everyone know my real-life name?

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:57:20 most people do
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:57:35 plane crazy PVP is nothing more than a bunch of low effort sticks flying around
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:57:39 and turrets
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:58:18 
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:58:37 plane crazy PVP is broken
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:58:41 the meta is absolute shit.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 21:59:01 pvp in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:00:03 
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:00:39 nah, that's being a noob
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:00:44 in a thruster stick
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:01:18 everyone just builds tiny planes you CANNOT hit because of their size
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:01:21 that's it
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:01:56 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:01:57 they don't
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:01:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:02:18 but you can't
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:02:22 because they go like 300 sps
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:02:35 nah, rockets have impact radius remember?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:02:40 the planes often just snap in half
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:03:03 BRUHBRUHBRUHBRUH
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:03:13 small planes

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:05 like
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:13 wtf is your problem
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:18 seriousdog
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:19 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:41 20 hours is one thing and i felt exhausted after that
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:44 50 hours
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:10:47 is something else
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:11:17 i have music theory test tomorrow and there's so fucking much idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:12:01 why don't you try suggesting a way to improve it
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:18:30 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:18:44 what

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:22:08 
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:22:39 well
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:22:39 sort of
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:22:41 not really
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:22:51 it's a neural network trained unsupervised on reddit data
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:23:00 and it takes in input text and predicts what comes next
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:23:26 bye
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:23:40 i tried it for 10 minutes and got bored
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:24:06 
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:24:32 it foretold
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:24:33 the future
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 17:33:30 are you sure roblox won't delete pc for it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 18:05:41 big dumdum
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 18:58:07 when mods get sick of toxicity in chat
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 18:58:52 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:32:39 tis shit tho
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:33:06 well, it *was* shit, idk if it still is
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:33:15 but it was the epicentre of several shitshows
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:33:21 like voxel and the golem farm
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:33:43 also it has minimal rule enforcement, no plugins, generally badly managed
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:45:13 wait, what the fuck, HOF requirement is now 50 upvotes?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:45:19 that's stupid
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:45:22 just voxel being lazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:45:29 SIGH.
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:45:33 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:46:35 ???
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:46:50 where does it say 50?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:46:53 what channel
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:47:46 thank
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:49:19 aight i asked voxel to change it back
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:49:27 i will still abide by 30 for now
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:50:00 link it here
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:50:02 please
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:50:07 and which one?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:50:20 link it then
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:51:11 i won't bother then
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:51:13 it can stay there
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:51:54 you need an expert rank
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:53:21 thank
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:53:49 which is fucking stupid
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:53:56 no creation worthy of HOF has 50 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:54:01 r.votetop
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:54:09 r.votetop <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:54:43 this is exactly what causes all the arguments about HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:54:51 it should be for upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:55:04 no, it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:55:11 the community's standards are just low
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:55:17 building ability
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:55:18 rather
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:57:53 the upvote count should be 30 to get to mod choosing stage
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:58:05 otherwise there would be one single creation in there
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 22:58:32 lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:07:56 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:07:58 modlogs
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:08:01 screenshots?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:08:04 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:08:14 <@!365701714768297994> EXPLAIN YOURSELF!
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:08:22 <@!644278652179316736> AND YOU TOO
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:09:32 why didn't you correct him then <:DabOnEm:520022237705928704>
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:09:56 and why did your cousin even create your account in the first place -.-
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:10:29 well let's at least do the first one

plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:10:34 .-.
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:11:15 now
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:12:31 dropped it
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:12:42 no way was he telling the truth, lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:12:46 talking WAY too casually
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:13:10 noctua does sunday roasts sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:13:13 with undes
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:13:39 not rn actually, I just unlocked a nice big new chunk of a game and kinda want to do that rn, maybe later?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:13:57 i'm 65 or smth
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:14:03 can't remember exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:14:15 skins, idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:16:10 it went on featured or smth
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:16:17 front page something or other
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:16:25 nah there used to be like 2k+
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:16:33 last year
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:33:26 try screwing around with the motor's variables
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:33:29 eg torque
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:34:35 and yes lego, i did finish the homework like 2 hours ago but then i had to go have dinner and shit, just got back and i need to go sleep in like 20 mins anyways
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:34:44 i can play on saturday
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:34:50 tea you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:35:03 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:39:24 we fucking need this
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:39:30 i've suggested this like 3 times lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:40:16 it would be really nice for like, laser guided missiles/bombs, turrets, submarine hunting, shooting down thruster sticks, etc
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:36:25 enable physicc
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:37:56 detached wings go on a fucking crusade
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:38:41 especially if stacked ontop of one another
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:38:45 sadly
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:38:45 well. used to
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:39:32 that's a slightly different problem where the wings try and stabilise too quickly
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:40:01 so the right will end up rolling to the left, which makes the whole plane roll to the right, which makes it roll to the left, etc
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:40:17 going faster = more lift
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:40:22 which is why it happens
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:41:09 magnet drives seem to be better for that problem tbh
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 20:41:13 not 100% sure why
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:52:49 what
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:53:07 i was pretty sure we had evidence and witnesses to say that he was going to conduct a raid
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:54:59 fungamer was banned a LONG time before that
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:55:00 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:55:42 u in america?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 16:56:41 oh no you fucking don't
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:10:42 blame roblox
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:10:43 not rickje
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:12:57 problem is that the <13 filter works on a whitelist, while 13+ works on a blacklist(I think)
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:16:08 the filter would probably be so much better if they ran it on an lstm
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 00:22:39 wha
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:27:24 people don't upvote because of effort
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:30:39 people won't upvote a plane that you spent 2 hours on but looks hideous.
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:31:41 ?
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:08 THIS
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:10 we're not putting
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:11 fucking
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:12 joke builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:14 in HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:36 i'm not abiding by 40
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:38 just 30
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:45 40 is no
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:32:57 barely anyone will get 40 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:01 except for meme builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:25 HOF is supposed to be for great-looking builds, but there shouldn't be 2 in there
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:31 it's meant to be a place to get inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:33 and motivate people
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:39 that's its purpose
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:46 if we put like 2 builds in there
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:33:50 no one's gonna care about it
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:34:27 yah
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:27 ^
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:34 voxel put it in
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:36 even though
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:38 we agreed
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:40 no joke builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:41 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:39:57 exactly ^^
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 23:40:05 we already decided on mod team
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 16:10:50 damnit
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:33:14 oh god oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:35:59 he said he 'needed security' to know that voxel wouldn't go apeshit or something like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:36:35 but i mean, i think he was pretty serious about it considering the method with which he asked
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:39:17 are you implying
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:39:21 that only water can freeze
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:39:38 <:what:644996672048463942>

plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:43:01 cellulose
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:43:07 freezes at that point
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:43:15 it's the stuff wood is made of
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 17:43:19 among other things

plane-crazy 2019-12-06 23:32:25 mee6 🅱️ roke
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 23:34:20 this is entertaining to watch
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 23:34:47 a bunch of people screaming about someone who created an alternate account
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 23:35:04 alright, i'm off to bed

plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:49:48 oh. thought they would...
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:52:50 hello
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:53:10 did i?
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:55:39 looking at chat history fonkl is still inactive
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:55:56 not surprised noc or creativ stepped down
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 12:57:22 alright, that's all i really wanted to know. bye.
general 2020-03-31 13:37:34 hoi
general 2020-03-31 13:37:54 i'm not here to stay, don't worry 😛
general 2020-03-31 13:38:04 just want to see if anything's changed since a month ago
general 2020-03-31 13:39:24 wow this is actually a really nice build
general 2020-03-31 13:40:22 nope
general 2020-03-31 13:40:44 frick
general 2020-03-31 13:43:07 and wow this is amazing
general 2020-03-31 13:43:51 no, but that has such great potential. like, you could link it up to a certain neural network and train it on people's builds and then have it automatically spit out results
general 2020-03-31 13:44:12 ...using this
general 2020-03-31 13:44:18 yeah, but still. would be interesting
general 2020-03-31 13:44:38 community not for me, me not for community
general 2020-03-31 13:46:03 pretty much what i predicted
general 2020-03-31 13:46:23 nope
general 2020-03-31 13:46:55 oh hey my rank system is still in place! 😄
general 2020-03-31 13:47:09 what. what is that?
general 2020-03-31 13:48:52 gravity gamemode and mobile support... nice, nice
general 2020-03-31 13:49:10 not for long
general 2020-03-31 13:49:16 i just wanted to see what was happening
general 2020-03-31 13:49:38 i still don't really want to join back permanently and probably never will tbh
general 2020-03-31 13:50:18 ...
general 2020-03-31 13:55:43 alright, that's all i really wanted to see, I'm off now 👋
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:14:27 verified instantly now, nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:14:37 just routine checkup, nothing to see here
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:15:35 you, purified and yousuf mods now, nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:29:09 turbothunder stopped talking, darkzified gone, neutronium gone, fonkl still has 2 muted roles
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:29:34 this channel becoming inactive
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:30:48 aand the game also finished transitioning to aesthetics over function
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:30:57 aka hover parts
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:31:33 wow though, the server is way more inactive than it used to be
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:32:27 and all in a hardcoded game
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:33:32 mm, maybe i'll stay a while this time if only to post/look at creations
bug-reports 2020-06-04 23:34:03 👏
creations-chat 2020-06-04 23:37:41 .?
creations-chat 2020-06-04 23:37:45 it's online
creations-chat 2020-06-04 23:37:46 wth
creations-chat 2020-06-04 23:37:51 .createlink
creations-chat 2020-06-04 23:37:56 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:39:40 oh nice, my rank system from like a year ago is still there... votes for HOF raises to 60
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:43:12 oh, #vip-servers no longer a thing, probably only accessible to ranked members
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:48:25 jesus christ the rules are a huge wall of text now
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:55:52 yeah i hate rules that are just a massive wall of text
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 23:56:07 everyone including me just skims through them and misses key information
general 2020-06-04 23:58:17 i have FTD, good if you like spreadsheets, massively complex systems you can never understand, weird battle mechanics and being extremely satisfied when something doesn't blow up
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 00:01:10 ah right
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 00:11:18 if i do stay it's just to share build, tbh i think plane crazy got too easy and there's no reward in building functional things anymore but it's still a nice medium for building
creations-chat 2020-06-05 00:28:44 f35's extremely overbuilt
creations-chat 2020-06-05 00:29:23 do a search in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:23:14 a small boi
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:24:41 wait why are crosses a block now
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:26:53 👋
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:28:04 that would be nice actually, since I might stay awhile this time
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:31:51 thanks a ton 👍
general 2020-06-05 10:45:58 yeah motors should definitely be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 11:35:58 granted ^^

plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:36:06 hM?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:36:21 hello
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:36:38 i said i left the community
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:36:46 i joined back yesterday and thought i might stay for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:36:57 but probably wouldn't be active
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:37:19 the name rings a bell but i don't remember much tbh
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:37:21 remind me?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:37:48 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:37:54 yeah, I remember
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:39:46 huh, how do you enter contests now?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:41:03 can't type there. does it open later on?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:42:32 oh for goodness sake, crashed
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:42:43 ...oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:07:31 it was a thing in the past but there was a ton of spam
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:07:57 take it like this; the ranks are a way of making sure you've played long enough/understand the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:30:38 ..
general 2020-06-05 16:51:26 i'm laughing so hard right now because this is on our school's website and when you play it there's just a single note on a piano playing the first part of vivaldi's spring theme
creations-chat 2020-06-05 17:10:40 thanks
creations-chat 2020-06-05 17:17:02 thank ^^ means a lot to me
creations-chat 2020-06-05 18:30:18 alright so wtf happened to moderation in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-06-05 18:30:41 like there's a literal meme that has nothing to do with plane crazy and a wmv file
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:17:50 successful motor split without anchor
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:17:56 fully split
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:18:02 not connected to the previous part
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 21:26:09 i'm finding it hard to understand wtf is going on
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 21:33:38 ???
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 23:52:18 hi
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:15:47 unobtainable now
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:15:56 it was for creating a unique mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:16:06 but yeah there was controversy about it
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:16:55 no, it has to do something completely new
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:17:07 for example someone got one for working calculator
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:18:08 someone built flying toaster that did that but didn't get inventor
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:18:19 and yeah this is the main reason it's unobtainable now
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:18:26 no one could agree on what counted
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:19:28 i have no idea 😛
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 00:19:40 probably would depend on the complexity
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 11:27:42 <@340543153922768906> might want to remove this man's warn :/
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 13:41:52 mmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 13:42:42 hello
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 14:55:32 yeah game still broken as ever
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 15:23:42 ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 15:23:49 t-t-
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 15:23:51 TEA
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 15:24:29 hello
general 2020-06-06 16:21:09 
general 2020-06-06 16:21:17 i'll do it
general 2020-06-06 16:22:59 
general 2020-06-06 16:23:06 i will
general 2020-06-06 16:23:07 do it
general 2020-06-06 17:07:31 ...
general 2020-06-06 17:08:45 look noob
general 2020-06-06 17:15:53 VODKA
general 2020-06-06 17:35:43 wait why did i say vodka
general 2020-06-06 17:35:44 i meant
general 2020-06-06 17:35:45 TEA
general 2020-06-06 17:42:28 yeah just a PNG or JPEG file, or any standard picture format
general 2020-06-06 19:04:33 what're you talking about? summer even starts every december
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:03:45 say that i used special characters of some sort to bypass roblox chat filter so i could write single letters on signs (it censors certain letters by themselves for some reasons and i want text going down my rocket side). if i posted that in <#384025409945337856> would it be allowed?
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:06:49 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:06:52 👋
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:07:16 i came back but probably won't be very active, not part of staff, just want to share my creations and look at others'
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:08:39 oh wow that actually works
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:08:40 thanks a ton
general 2020-06-06 22:58:19 madattak is busy IRL
general 2020-06-06 22:58:22 like very busy
general 2020-06-06 22:58:55 rick's working on the game ofc, but the truth is no one really understands how the whole thing works, just how to add onto it
general 2020-06-06 22:59:02 yeah, but those are much easier to work on
general 2020-06-06 22:59:08 not hardcoded
general 2020-06-06 22:59:12 hi
general 2020-06-06 22:59:44 no
general 2020-06-06 22:59:49 basically
general 2020-06-06 23:00:04 it's built in a way that lots of parts of the code depend on other parts
general 2020-06-06 23:00:36 but within those parts, each part works on its own with minimal influence from the other parts
general 2020-06-06 23:00:48 so imagine like
general 2020-06-06 23:01:11 idk... imagine a light that only turns on if the red switch is flicked
general 2020-06-06 23:01:38 then one day the circuitry is changed so that the orange switch now has to be flicked
general 2020-06-06 23:02:00 in a hardcoded game then the light would still depend on the red switch turning on
general 2020-06-06 23:02:20 but in a softcoded game the switch would know that it's been changed to the orange switch
general 2020-06-06 23:02:25 and yeah
general 2020-06-06 23:02:38 idk how much but like i said, no one really knows how the whole thing works
general 2020-06-06 23:02:58 and madattak himself said that it would be easier to rescript completely than to convert
general 2020-06-06 23:03:31 he doesn't have the time
general 2020-06-06 23:03:50 he maintains his other games because they are easy to work on, he has a proper team working on them and he earns a bit of money from them
general 2020-06-06 23:04:38 well that's the gray area
general 2020-06-06 23:04:46 idk who the funds go to but 99% it's rickje
general 2020-06-06 23:05:07 now imagine madattak demanded rick reroute a percentage of the funds to him
general 2020-06-06 23:05:11 yeah i'd be angry
general 2020-06-06 23:05:32 ugh animal farm
general 2020-06-06 23:05:39 i mean, in theory yes
general 2020-06-06 23:06:00 but the issue is again, it's not easy to maintain plane crazy
general 2020-06-06 23:06:11 and madattak hasn't worked on it for years
general 2020-06-06 23:06:17 he'd have to relearn everything
the-dump 2020-06-06 23:29:10 what the fuck did i just watch
the-dump 2020-06-06 23:29:22 god i missed plane crazy shitposting

general 2020-06-07 01:15:57 generic fps games are the bane of my existence
general 2020-06-07 02:04:37 wtf is going on
general 2020-06-07 02:04:55 this is plane crazy as i remembered it lmfao
general 2020-06-07 02:06:30 He harvest the modlog on an indistrial scale
general 2020-06-07 02:06:59 Hos the fuck does this even happen lmao
general 2020-06-07 02:07:51 What?
general 2020-06-07 02:08:44 Lol it's really not helping
general 2020-06-07 02:11:16 why the fuck are people getting muted over spamming a picture of a downvote
general 2020-06-07 02:11:46 Defo not
general 2020-06-07 02:12:02 Especially after seeing this
general 2020-06-07 02:14:50 I'm not rejoining mod team, i rly don't like how the server and voxels reasoning have evolved
general 2020-06-07 02:17:26 I mean that he's completely ignored me every time i tried to talk with him on my own in the past, rules are now a huge wall of text everyone's going to skim over and restrictive bot filtering that never prevents anything bad... Idk i just find servers that evolve like that end up being the most toxic ones. Reverse psychology, human phenomena, blablabla
general 2020-06-07 02:19:18 like when I proposed ths HOF it took him a week to respond, he said 'no' and nothing else and then when i asked why deleted the channel
general 2020-06-07 02:19:34 then made it liks a month later
general 2020-06-07 02:21:23 oh same thing happened when I spent several hours rewriting the rules to be readable. no criticism whatsoever, just 'no' and wouldn't respond to prompts
general 2020-06-07 02:22:10 i just don't feel like stuff i do would be valued or considered. </rant>
general 2020-06-07 02:31:07 why are people even riotinf anyways?
general 2020-06-07 02:32:18 yeah this server's followed exactly the routs i thought it had :/
general 2020-06-07 02:32:23 Route
general 2020-06-07 03:40:55 mm yes tightening rules makes things worse and this is proof
general 2020-06-07 03:41:44 tbh I'm considering it. but I wouldn't be able to change anything
general 2020-06-07 03:43:19 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-06-07 03:44:16 Search for their tags in modlogs
general 2020-06-07 04:05:36 tbh when I designed the new ranks i mostly had in mind a kind of systematic way you could at a glance get an average of someone's skill level, and also to give people goals to work towars
general 2020-06-07 04:06:57 i think the rank request system does kinda take the second part out of that a little since people don't see the requests and the creations people are ranked for themselves, but easier for mods
creations-chat 2020-06-07 04:11:21 wmvs are allowed now?
creations-chat 2020-06-07 04:11:34 just checked rules, nothing there
general 2020-06-07 10:54:04 cannon release delayed because of broken education system <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:30:13 that's not the point
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:30:47 the point is the other ranks are *super* easy to get
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:30:53 designer III is a step up
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:00 and people need to be able to build well
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:02 to get it
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:08 *remotely* well at least
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:31 personally i wouldn't give designer ranks for memes
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:36:52 well that was the original idea behind HOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:37:00 to make good builds visible
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:37:09 but yeah standards are too high
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 14:15:49

general 2020-06-07 16:26:40 about that
general 2020-06-07 16:26:58 solution is to spam group wall, obviously
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:28:23 <@!597460948248428555> there's an official list of VIP servers accessible to people with ranks, if you want you can DM an admin and ask to have it added. your choice obviously

general 2020-06-07 16:30:19 it's like a CPU but it runs lots and lots of very simple calculations
general 2020-06-07 16:30:24 which makes it ideal for graphics

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:35:45 it's in HOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:37:02 the original plan was to suspend the core using magnets
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:37:08 but after the 4th crash i abandoned that idea
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:37:26 so it just rocket/smoke/light spam
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:41:46 yeah industrial builds are really fun
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:42:06 grablador's done tons of stuff with houses/hotels too, really cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:46:32 oh yeah there was a landscaping contest a while back

creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:44:36 And yea it's blocky but imo in a good way
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:44:48 After all smooth builds do get a bit boring
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:47:22 Absolutely, textured builds are the best
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:47:54 One of the reasons I dislike passenger jets
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:48:37 Yup
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:51:33 Well, yeah. How'd you do it though? When I designed them I was considering adding roles for stuff like building robots that use a certain mechanism but the issue was there'd be tons of debate around whether certain builds counted or not. The designer ranks are kinda the main compromise for that
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:56:07 Oh, also that was the thinking behind needing upvotes for expert ranks. Can't reach the top without peopls liking your stuff

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:52:23 there isn't really a point to jets with much more powerful engines

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:47:09 oh tru actually
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:47:26 I have something in HOF but it was from when there was a lower requirement
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:49:19 thank
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:49:19 i have acquired designer V

general 2020-06-09 11:20:47 help
general 2020-06-09 11:20:49 what's the difference
general 2020-06-09 11:20:52 between these two
general 2020-06-09 11:20:53 questions
general 2020-06-09 11:22:53 i'm so
general 2020-06-09 11:22:54 confused
general 2020-06-09 11:24:35 in theory yes
general 2020-06-09 11:24:56 but the answer's the same for both of them: it's for performing logic and arithmetic operations
general 2020-06-09 11:29:17 i asked on python discord. they did not disappoint
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 15:02:17 can we make this a meme format

plane-crazy 2020-06-09 16:57:10 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 16:57:11 shut up
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:44:41 this
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:44:51 or this?
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:46:49 yeah that's the thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:47:09 but I tried making it a bit less straight and it just looked bad because... bloccy
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:47:46 ye plan is to build infrastructure on top, so i don't want to screw around with elevation too much yet but I will in future
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:49:04 i mean -
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:49:52 something like that I imagine
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:50:03 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:51:00 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:51:34 I'll try that later but tbh i don't think it'll fit in with the theme of the map... want to keep it a bit simpler if that makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 18:02:16 what te actual fuck
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 19:39:46 
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 19:57:57 for goodness sake
help 2020-06-09 22:42:10 <@!592756480118358016> centre the landing gears that are most toward the back on the centre of mass/lift. basically it lets the plane 'rotate' around that point like a pivot if you see what I mean
help 2020-06-09 22:42:43 and make sure they're tall enough so the tail doesn't strike the ground in a way that prevents you taking off
help 2020-06-09 22:44:01 and ye as RBK said your tail surfaces are on backwards
help 2020-06-09 22:45:40 show it in build mode
help 2020-06-09 22:45:43 from the side preferably
help 2020-06-09 22:47:32 move the back gears forward so it's in line with the centre of mass and lift
help 2020-06-09 22:48:00 
help 2020-06-09 22:48:08 nope, that won't work
help 2020-06-09 22:48:46 just move the back gears forward. the plane has to be able to rotate backwards
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 13:50:48 no matter how many modular weapons systems are implemented, pvp will probably continue to be broken
general 2020-06-10 15:51:21 idk man
general 2020-06-10 15:51:34 modlogs for a moderator are a big no-no
general 2020-06-10 15:53:27 there are countries other than the US -.-
general 2020-06-10 15:53:37 my teasville must persist
general 2020-06-10 15:53:39 we will
general 2020-06-10 15:53:43 tea
general 2020-06-10 15:53:43 just
general 2020-06-10 15:54:04 basically in the UK we do things the correct way >:)
general 2020-06-10 15:54:58 still, even 1 ban is a very big nono
creations-chat 2020-06-10 15:55:21 yes, or/and link the message
general 2020-06-10 16:17:16 speed they go up/down
general 2020-06-10 16:17:17 i believe
general 2020-06-10 16:17:21 could be wrong
general 2020-06-10 16:19:04 <@!527653676022628353> please for the love of god get designer V by any means necessary so I know that fonkl and I didn't spend 30 minutes discussing what expert supreme's name should be in vain
general 2020-06-10 16:19:19 🙏
general 2020-06-10 16:21:06 now that I think about it I almost have VTOL and aeronautical V (at IV), then I just need robotic and terrain V
general 2020-06-10 16:21:12 yes
general 2020-06-10 16:21:38 possibly, yes
general 2020-06-10 16:22:00 idk depends how community is feeling on that day
general 2020-06-10 16:22:17 but pixel art
general 2020-06-10 16:22:22 jesus 60?
general 2020-06-10 16:22:43 that... really can't be done unless you post big funny meme
general 2020-06-10 16:23:29 but like
general 2020-06-10 16:23:30 jesus
general 2020-06-10 16:24:51 honestly I want to try for HOF but i *don't know what do build >:(*
general 2020-06-10 16:25:10 again i mean
general 2020-06-10 16:25:13 with new threshold
general 2020-06-10 16:25:24 yes 2 creations but from when it was 30 upvotes
general 2020-06-10 16:25:34 hold on I'll link
general 2020-06-10 16:25:38 the messages

general 2020-06-10 16:26:19 both of these
general 2020-06-10 16:26:25 but ye 30 upvotes needed
general 2020-06-10 16:27:05 before rick started working on the game i think
general 2020-06-10 16:30:05 expert rank
general 2020-06-10 16:32:59 probably from before you needed an expert rank
general 2020-06-10 16:33:29 ;/
general 2020-06-10 16:35:01 he must have gotten it before you needed an expert rank.
general 2020-06-10 16:35:33 ?whois
general 2020-06-10 16:35:38 !whois
general 2020-06-10 16:35:42 yeah idk
general 2020-06-10 16:35:57 well what do you suggest then?
general 2020-06-10 16:36:23 🤦‍♂️
general 2020-06-10 16:37:56 don't you need like III+
general 2020-06-10 16:38:08 i'll check
bot-central 2020-06-10 16:38:30 ?shelp
general 2020-06-10 16:38:47 apparently you just need to be ranked
general 2020-06-10 16:38:56 any rank including I's
general 2020-06-10 16:39:17 i
general 2020-06-10 16:39:21 yes
general 2020-06-10 16:41:10 'FUCK YOU ALL!'
general 2020-06-10 16:41:26 un bruh
general 2020-06-10 16:42:09 `o'rly`
general 2020-06-10 16:43:27 `hmm`
general 2020-06-10 16:43:49 ...
general 2020-06-10 16:45:22 ???
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 17:20:16 how does this look?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 17:20:32 miniature industrial complex
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 17:24:41 what could be better about it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:28:53 does this village-thing look out of place?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:29:02 
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:44:09 with roads. better?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:54:02 ..
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:20:52 town is finished, does that look OK?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:32:56 like this?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:48:11 yeah, about the farm
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:48:29 the poor farmer is about to be...
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:48:32 ...built on
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:48:40 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:50:34 ok nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:50:40 apparently roblox decided to save the farmer
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:50:41 and crashed
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 20:50:45 taking the bridge with it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:16:27 farmer has been successfully built on
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:17:08 i'm sorry
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:17:10 we had to do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:17:57 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:19:21 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:19:24 i will give him more field
bot-central 2020-06-11 09:22:09 !giveadmin

general 2020-06-11 10:48:20 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
general 2020-06-11 11:01:45 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 12:21:08 i go afk for 5 minutes
creations-chat 2020-06-11 14:56:35 love the detail ;D
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:49:00 so close >:c
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:50:28 farmer appreciates your kindness ❤️
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:54:12 what theme?
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:54:48 (172, 115, 57)?
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:55:27 i'm not trying to guilt trip people .-. they can upvote if they want, downvote if they want. but it's be a shame if it got 59 upvotes lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:56:33 alright. you don't have to, that's fine
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 16:56:59 no it's fine, I understand if it annoys you ;p
creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:59:30 factorio better, change me mind >:)
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:02:03 but because of that it's much slower than factorio
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:02:11 so factorio lets factory grow more
general 2020-06-11 17:20:30 tbh I don't think the age requirement should be a thing. you should be able to tell how mature someone is and if they'll fit the role from their application, otherwise it isn't a good application
general 2020-06-11 17:28:52 i mean yeah, I get it reduces the number of applications to go through but most of the time the first long answer is enough to tell you if it's worth reviewing or not
general 2020-06-11 17:31:08 in most cases yea, but... idk. it just seems a bit arbitrary to me, it can be fluid
general 2020-06-11 17:33:47 it's a matter of opinion and also the community. kinda hard to gather statistics on something like that
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:17 i think you overestimate how hard it is to get started in this game especially if you haven't played anything like it before or don't have understanding of aerodynamics
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:58 i was talking to striker :p
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:17 it's fine
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:49:06 how can you know that though?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:49:15 that the standards are that high
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:50:47 ???
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:51:10 ^
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:52:12 my terrain thing took about 16 hours in total... wasn't counting tho
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:52:34 yup, the skill ceiling is huge
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:54:46 rick would expand the building space, people have asked before, but the game is, again, hardcoded
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:55:42 the problem is that people enjoy just shitting on other people and not providing any meaningful feedback
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:56:37 i used to play bym/byd but there's just a certain charm to plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:11 no aerodynamics though, and more boring map
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:15 no
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:47 secret is always in the detailing, find a way to incorporate texture and interesting patterns into otherwise flat surfaces
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:59:17 simple VTOL's are good for getting a feel on the aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:14:20 imo it looks better in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:14:26 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:14:27 fly mode
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:14:45 but we can agree that in build mode it makes it impossible to see anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:16:56 can we have like
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:17:15 automatically built outlines in build mode that are then deleted when we go into fly mode
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:17:58 idk if it's possible but a script that automatically builds blocks on the lengths and widths of a model's solid parts
general 2020-06-11 18:20:26 go back to sleep
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:25:09 yes
general 2020-06-11 18:26:51 tbh idk why inventor/modeller was removed from <#609442446249820211> . there should be something saying they're no longer obtainable/handpicked, because it causes confusion like this ^^
general 2020-06-11 18:27:56 well... yea that's the point. it should say 'Inventor and modeller are no longer obtainable, do not ask staff about this'
general 2020-06-11 18:28:46 ???
general 2020-06-11 18:29:10 read
general 2020-06-11 18:29:12 what it says there
general 2020-06-11 18:29:41 
general 2020-06-11 18:30:59 that was implemented after people started asking for designer for a single block that got 100 upvotes
general 2020-06-11 18:31:05 ???????
general 2020-06-11 18:31:21 what on earth are you talking about

general 2020-06-12 13:57:28 modeller is no longer obtainable
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:38:38 post that in <#384025409945337856>? it's really cool
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:40:28 ah right, my bad
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:40:36 yeah industrial builds are really fun
general 2020-06-12 17:12:07 <@!192861290677534722> that's really cool, did you program the network in yourself?
general 2020-06-12 17:12:48 backpropagation?
general 2020-06-12 17:14:00 ah, right. i've made a few in python but never been able to do anything with them, it would be nice to program them into roblox and actually have them learn something in-game like you're doing
general 2020-06-12 17:16:31 it would be fun to give them slow-firing-guns and the ability to see bullets coming towards them and just watch them do matrix-style fighting
general 2020-06-12 17:42:24 
general 2020-06-12 17:43:54 just use cutter blocks lol

plane-crazy 2020-06-13 10:40:05 can we make this a cult
help 2020-06-13 10:41:32 <@!696252654493368360> <#609442446249820211>
help 2020-06-13 10:41:58 the colour depends on what tier of rank you have
general 2020-06-13 11:39:31 yes discourage newbies from getting into the game because there is an official system to mock their builds
help 2020-06-13 12:46:27 sometimes, it is a necessary evil
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:47:19 i'll say it again: yes, let's discourage new players from playing the game because there's an official system in place to mock bad builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:49:39 if you mean the 'i built a block' and similar... it might stop some of it but it'd just give a really shitty impression to new players that we don't want to help them get better
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:49:50 which i guess is sort of true, but there you go
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:54:44 worst thing, at least imo, is when people post their 'first' builds for something and it's actually really decent for a first build but still gets tons of downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:58:47 yeah, that's exactly it
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:59:32 faintly, yea, but it was a while back
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:02:39 oh yeah, imo HOF requirements are too harsh. the thing with <#384025409945337856> is that tons of people vote for it so you can get a good idea of the 'average' but in <#544722974574379021> you have like 10 people voting on one thing. getting 10 upvotes basically requires your build to be god-level or to be lucky with who sees it or not. imo it should be a ratio of upvotes to downvotes required or something like that...
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:04:31 the whole point of HoF when I proposed it was not to boost people's egos but to provide inspiration for other people who want to build something impressive
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:05:40 yup, but with the last post being over a month ago there are barely any new builds coming in at all. It should be the top builds, not the top of the top of the top
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:06:16 the builds most people agree look better than average
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:10:04 decorative lasers
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:10:19 for targeting, docking, making builds look cool, etc
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:12:27 n o
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:42:57 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 13:43:05 and yeah you need a rank from <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 15:20:15 it's nice but lacking in colour. maybe use some different shades of gray or introduce a secondary colour?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 15:21:56 i would recommend colouring clearly different parts of the aircraft different colours - wings gray, control surfaces black, etc
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 15:22:29 idk bot is overzealous
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 15:23:21 i...
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 15:23:31 i won't question the thought process that led to that
general 2020-06-13 15:25:46 ..
help 2020-06-13 15:26:11 are your engines in this section?
help 2020-06-13 15:30:19 yeah, try and place your engines in line with the centre of mass and lift
help 2020-06-13 15:30:38 if it doesn't pitch well, add control surfaces at the back. the further back they are the more they'll help with pitch

plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:48:26 144,652 blocks is the max you can have in a building plot
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:48:40 oh wait height limit was changed
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:49:14 taking inspiration
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:49:19 not a copy I'd say
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:50:17 and yea, 100k blocks. rick himself explained that too many blocks can literally crash the server so he wanted to have a limit... imo it should be a bit higher though
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:50:42 🤷‍♂️ just saying what rick told me
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 22:50:55

creations-chat 2020-06-15 16:04:38 read the thing the bot sent, it tells you how to get a rank
creations-chat 2020-06-15 16:05:06 you have to use a ticket system - it used to be requested in <#384025409945337856> but a lot of rank requests were missed
creations-chat 2020-06-15 16:06:35 <@456226577798135808> if you're going to criticise other builds please make it constructive, alright?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 16:07:09 we all had to start somewhere. that we aren't instantly god builders isn't a reason to say builds from new players are bad.

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:21:27 madattak never intended the game to become popular
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:21:38 it was more an experiment/project to see what would happen
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:21:48 it wasn't worth making it flexible
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:21:59 then he got caught up with IRL stuff and.. yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:22:06 yes..?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 12:22:37 exactly. it blew up, because the game is fantastic, but it wasn't intended to be popular

bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:23:43 alright, nvm
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:25:11 no, don't worry about it, plenty of people are reporting the problem. I just wanted to get some F9 logs to show the developer
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:29:41 there's been a lot of debate about that, there's just one developer so progress isn't fast, a couple of maps have been proposed but none implemented. plot size would be increased but the game is hardcoded, which means that it's extremely hard to do
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:31:22 a lot of people have a lot of suggestions, but the way the game is scripted makes it almost impossible to do a lot of them
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:18 well... I hate to say it but no
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:24 there was an entire contest for that

bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:56:19 not sure if rick's going to join or not. in case he's away or smth, can you open logs by pressing F9 and screenshot any red text?
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:57:05 oh, in that case yea rick will need to join
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:57:36 he seems to have gone again so feel free to leave if you want I guess..

general 2020-06-17 23:00:07 👺
general 2020-06-18 13:27:43 you can't just 'softcode a game.' don't say things like that about mad unless you understand what it means, please
general 2020-06-18 13:40:34 <@!654239873489960970> look, you have no clue what you're talking about. you CAN NOT 'softcode a game.' it has to be completely rewritten which would take at least a 6 months, likely more, even if mad came back which is unlikely
general 2020-06-18 13:40:47 I'm in favour of a rewrite
general 2020-06-18 13:40:57 hmm yes
general 2020-06-18 13:41:11 rewrite or 60 hours adding new wedges? vote now 👍
general 2020-06-18 13:41:16 no lol
general 2020-06-18 13:42:21 he has school and IRL stuff... a human being as well, unlike most people believe
general 2020-06-18 13:43:25 a game like plane crazy is not gonna be rewritten in 2 months whatever happens, lol
general 2020-06-18 13:43:53 what's your reasoning?
general 2020-06-18 13:44:37 no... that's really not going to help
general 2020-06-18 13:44:42 have you seen the game's source code?
general 2020-06-18 13:44:52 thousands of complicated lines of code
general 2020-06-18 13:45:05 now imagine rewriting that as object-orientated
general 2020-06-18 13:45:50 if it's easier and faster and more flexible to softcode, why would mad have hardcoded it in the first place?
general 2020-06-18 13:46:09 it's tough to write things softcoded. it really is.
general 2020-06-18 13:46:19 ...
general 2020-06-18 13:46:50 it took mad 6 months to make it in the first place, hardcoded
general 2020-06-18 13:47:02 working on it almost every day.
general 2020-06-18 13:47:42 *i have seen the game's fucking source code, talked to mad himself about the whole issue, and played for 3 years.*
general 2020-06-18 13:47:46 ;-;
general 2020-06-18 13:48:01 it will.
general 2020-06-18 13:48:25 i don't know what to tell you anymore ;-;
general 2020-06-18 13:49:22 i bet 90% of the playerbase doesn't touch the wedges 2 tab..
general 2020-06-18 13:50:16 a full rewrite would just fix so much. if it could be done in 2 months, why the hell wouldn't rickje do it?
general 2020-06-18 13:51:46 it takes him 3 hours to add and bug test a new wedge. THAT is how tough it is to work with the game now
general 2020-06-18 13:51:47 exactly
general 2020-06-18 13:53:50 yes, that's exactly what would be the case. resize/rotate tools and angles, non-generic blocks, bigger plots, whitelisting, reduced lag, etc
general 2020-06-18 13:54:03 there are such a ridiculous number of benefits
general 2020-06-18 13:55:50 because 1) he needs mad's help, he's not a huge expert at writing mainframe and scripting in aerodynamics + good, flexible code, 2) it would take ages and people are more concerned with new wedges to be added in the meantime, 3) yes, he's waiting on madattak, but his questions are being ignored
general 2020-06-18 13:55:52 no
general 2020-06-18 13:55:56 that's not how it works
general 2020-06-18 13:55:59 the game is a massive mess
general 2020-06-18 13:56:39 yes
general 2020-06-18 13:57:17 no
general 2020-06-18 13:57:18 not
general 2020-06-18 13:57:18 that's
general 2020-06-18 13:57:21 how--- AHHHHH
general 2020-06-18 13:57:32 YOU CAN'T 'SOFTCODE A GAME.'
general 2020-06-18 13:57:35 it has to be
general 2020-06-18 13:57:37 rewritten
general 2020-06-18 13:57:39 OK?
general 2020-06-18 13:58:00 then listen to what I'm saying.
general 2020-06-18 13:58:17 ok, go ahead
general 2020-06-18 13:59:21 what do you mean by that?
general 2020-06-18 13:59:38 'not have the game in hardcode' - what does this mean tho
general 2020-06-18 14:00:06 yes. a rewrite.
general 2020-06-18 14:00:16 exactly
general 2020-06-18 14:00:28 that's what I've been saying. that you would have to rewrite the *entire game*
general 2020-06-18 14:01:21 not necessarily. depends how the saving system is implemented
general 2020-06-18 14:01:42 but since it's going to be a completely different game engine, it likely wouldn't load everything
general 2020-06-18 14:30:28 make AD and wait till PC 2
general 2020-06-18 14:30:30 then preach
help 2020-06-18 14:40:51 !servers
general 2020-06-18 14:49:36 reports have been disabled due to lack of ingame moderation

general 2020-06-18 15:01:26 now shush
general 2020-06-18 15:03:49 no, of *course* not..
general 2020-06-18 15:04:52 any kind of lag you could inflict on a plane crazy server can never compare to the insanity of VIP 1
general 2020-06-18 15:08:37 can you not behave yourself while I'm AFK for one second?
general 2020-06-18 15:08:44 alex please stop being so obnoxious.
general 2020-06-18 15:12:44 that's... very inaccurate lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 17:09:36 have some posts from the group wall while you wait
general 2020-06-18 17:25:51 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
general 2020-06-18 17:32:15 of course, it's a roblox game..
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 17:43:09 if you're going to criticise, make it more constructive than that
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 17:51:10 lmao
general 2020-06-18 18:16:46 pvp as a whole is broken
general 2020-06-18 18:17:08 unless it's organised and restricted
general 2020-06-18 18:17:11 then no thruster sticks
general 2020-06-18 18:17:15 and turrets spawncamping
general 2020-06-18 18:49:24 just came here and read this with no context

general 2020-06-18 19:56:05 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:05:19 ...
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:22:51 literally nothing
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:23:17 he made the initial game
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:23:23 then basically abandoned it
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:24:30 ...
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:24:37 yes, and whenever the caring mother asks the father about it he ignores her
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:24:43 it's good analogy
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:25:26 rick
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:25:45 but the game is becoming so much of a mess he probably won't be much longer ;/
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:28:14 i have a screenshot of this cargo passenger aircraft thing built by roborail if that's what you're looking for
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:29:24 idk if this classifies as a 'plane' or 'large' but closest I have that's built by me 😛
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:32:10 so we've had a new logo suggestion

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:28:05 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:28:14 he's busy with IRL stuff and ignores rick's messages

creations-chat 2020-06-19 11:21:39 - ***TEA***
general 2020-06-19 11:59:17 very very unlikely
general 2020-06-19 11:59:27 i'd say it's legit
general 2020-06-19 12:01:27 the creators of the game did.
general 2020-06-19 12:02:03 oh, to make the servers free
general 2020-06-19 12:06:33 let's keep that to <#495286269459300364>

general 2020-06-19 14:21:43 computer science ftw
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 14:25:52 dead meme but true

general 2020-06-19 14:50:31 summon
general 2020-06-19 14:51:06 a PFP isn't enough evidence - they could be using it for any number of reasons
general 2020-06-19 14:51:53 he thinks you're <13 because of your profile pic
creations-chat 2020-06-19 15:56:27 drama ?!
creations-chat 2020-06-19 15:57:35 😤
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:11:00 wow that actually looks really cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 11:45:16 <@!552343549572677632> plot size can't be increased because the game is hardcoded
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 11:45:30 rick would expand it but literally can't - it's basically impossible until the game is rewritten, so I deleted your suggestion for now
general 2020-06-20 11:49:53 what game is that? looks cool
general 2020-06-20 11:50:14 oh, nevermind, it's mentioned further up
general 2020-06-20 11:50:22 kingdoms and castles
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:42:29 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:42:34 no one said that self downvotes don't count
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:42:38 just upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:42:40 score of 0
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:43:04 wait no it says 'your own vote'
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 12:43:05 god damnit
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 13:26:57 so *that's* why rick wanted people to boost
general 2020-06-20 13:55:45 he has everything finished..
general 2020-06-20 13:55:52 it's uploading later
general 2020-06-20 13:55:54 just be patient
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 13:58:06 
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 13:58:18 it would appear we're waiting on mad
general 2020-06-20 13:58:42 he's dutch
general 2020-06-20 13:58:46 15:58
general 2020-06-20 13:58:53 he told me he's dutch
general 2020-06-20 13:59:30 ...*no*
general 2020-06-20 13:59:41 it won't help, lol
general 2020-06-20 14:01:08 pretty sure he has the server muted by now, ngl
general 2020-06-20 14:02:05 now

general 2020-06-20 16:05:28 uk government is just doing the exact opposite of what everyone expects lol
general 2020-06-20 16:06:58 🙏 jameson was best mod
general 2020-06-20 16:08:58 yes
general 2020-06-20 16:08:59 egg tonk
general 2020-06-20 16:09:26 ./.
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:25:02 it's been big for a long time
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:25:19 in theory yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:25:33 but he's ignoring rick's questions about the community/development
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:26:24 I deleted the suggestion btw since it's not possible rn
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:27:26 ranks should be balanced, boats are easier so they need to be bigger
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:27:31 and yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:27:38 apart from modellers he doesn't talk with
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:28:09 so I'd try and get a rank for whatever you're good at building
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:29:44 yeah nothing gets into HOF nowadays
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:30:04 everyone with access to <#544722974574379021>
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:30:19 so all modellers/inventors/masters/staff
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:30:33 but no one really votes
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:31:07 master ranks
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:31:47 contest winners get access too
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:13 actually, looking at the perms they don't..
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:16 i mean master ranks don't
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:22 which is odd
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:32 so yea, just the big boi ranks
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:34:01 for some categories if your build gets into HoF

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 18:07:46 well pvp is completely broken unless it's organised
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 18:08:01 blacklist everyone and build a turret for instance
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 18:08:15 or just stupidly fast thruster stick with a few guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 18:09:16 pc rewrite should bring that
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 18:09:22 but that's currently highest priority
help 2020-06-20 22:54:31 super thrusters lag your creation?
help 2020-06-20 22:54:48 i wouldn't really see any reason that would happen apart from the particle effects
help 2020-06-20 22:55:16 which can be turned off, but if you have smoke pipes etc you could just use jets or propellers

general 2020-06-22 22:37:59 that depends
general 2020-06-22 22:38:01 very much
general 2020-06-22 22:38:24 if they're a **very** bad parent I wouldn't say so
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:16:09 Why does it matter? lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:16:42 I meant why does being one of the first ones matter
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:16:47 What's it's significance?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:17:43 *why does being one of the first matter ;-;*
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:18:23 but you're arguing about it now
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:18:29 which shows that you do think it matters 😛
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:19:18 well, don't argue it then. it doesn't matter lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:20:08 *if you don't think it's important, don't argue with them.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 09:31:32 what the-

bug-reports 2020-06-24 10:32:26 that's an issue with your internet or roblox
bug-reports 2020-06-24 10:32:31 rickje has absolutely no control over it
general 2020-06-24 10:38:25 ...
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 11:34:40 sometimes
general 2020-06-24 12:16:38 welp, I think I beat the system
general 2020-06-24 12:27:49 i beat
general 2020-06-24 12:27:52 the error system
general 2020-06-24 12:28:02 
general 2020-06-24 12:28:08 it says
general 2020-06-24 12:28:10 too many errors
general 2020-06-24 12:28:21 no...
general 2020-06-24 12:28:25 it's golang
general 2020-06-24 12:28:33 i was using python but it is too fucking slow
general 2020-06-24 12:29:18 golang is 3x faster than C, literally the fastest language you can run on a CPU since it's compiled directly into machine code
general 2020-06-24 12:30:21 lua is even slower than python
general 2020-06-24 12:30:30 yes it is lol
general 2020-06-24 12:30:35 wait lemme find the benchmarks
general 2020-06-24 12:31:02 https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/lua-python3.html
general 2020-06-24 12:31:07 the first few are faster
general 2020-06-24 12:31:21 what are you talking about ;-;
general 2020-06-24 12:31:31 by roblox lua, do you mean the roblox API for lua?
general 2020-06-24 12:32:36 idk, the only difference must be in compiling/interpreting, whichever it is. syntax is the same on 'normal' lua as roblox lua
general 2020-06-24 12:32:47 let me have a look on google
general 2020-06-24 12:35:15 i can't find too much but it seems like it just uses an API (roblox API) and then has a bunch of extra functions written in C++?
general 2020-06-24 12:35:33 afk
general 2020-06-24 12:46:09 what's going on here
general 2020-06-24 12:46:30 the rules are in place for a reason .-.
general 2020-06-24 12:46:47 if you want to post NSFW, do it in a server NOT composed of mostly 13-15 year olds

plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:31:02 not possible
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:31:18 the game is hardcoded, which means if certain things are changed, a lot of other things will break
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:31:28 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:31:35 just a year to wait

general 2020-06-28 19:09:19 by the filtering enabled update
general 2020-06-28 19:10:00 this is why we need a #rules channel and not a huge wall of text embedded in another huge wall of text in a channel called <#533294912586645521>

general 2020-06-28 19:11:32 if they're not a massive wall of text that people sit down with a cup of tea for 30 minutes to read
general 2020-06-28 19:11:56 name it <#694754314245242891>

general 2020-06-30 16:44:23 when pizza???
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:13:49 imo using tutorials is absolutely fine if you learn something from it. it's when people just mindlessly copy it and show it off that it becomes a problem
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:14:15 but I think the whole point of tutorials should be teaching an underlying concept
general 2020-07-01 10:34:17 should I post this
general 2020-07-01 10:34:22 (not mine)
general 2020-07-01 10:35:37 mmm i want to do it

general 2020-07-01 15:11:45 if they do join stay civil and mature because from what we just saw there's a 99% chance of them losing their head and getting angry at us, and honestly that would be extremely entertaining
general 2020-07-01 15:13:27 wtf are we actually negotiating about?

general 2020-07-01 16:29:20 idk what that means though ._.
general 2020-07-01 16:37:28 i take that as a personal insult 😤
general 2020-07-01 16:57:00 you know you've failed at programming when you tell your program to output the mass of mercury and it spits out this
general 2020-07-01 17:07:09 lua makes me stressed as fuck
general 2020-07-01 17:07:15 it's just such an annoying language
general 2020-07-01 17:07:32 just working in python and golang rn. best languages
general 2020-07-01 17:12:38 i haven't tried java much
general 2020-07-01 17:13:10 i just learnt python because that's what my school teaches, then started learning golang because i'm having to wait for several hours for some python programs to finish
general 2020-07-01 17:13:45 did anyone actually understand anything?
general 2020-07-01 17:14:46 fair enough ;p
general 2020-07-01 17:16:27 one thing i hate about golang
general 2020-07-01 17:16:34 is this fucking type conversion stuff
general 2020-07-01 17:16:49 it becomes such a massive mess
general 2020-07-01 17:21:57 yes
general 2020-07-01 17:21:59 no
general 2020-07-01 17:22:01 well yes
general 2020-07-01 17:22:05 no

general 2020-07-01 17:22:21 python good
general 2020-07-01 17:22:24 lua and lua++ bd
general 2020-07-01 17:22:28 😤
general 2020-07-01 17:22:49 because slow and annoying error traceback and weird syntax in some case
general 2020-07-01 17:23:11 do you have benchmarks?
general 2020-07-01 17:23:35 no that's
general 2020-07-01 17:23:37 not how we measure
general 2020-07-01 17:23:46 hold on a moment
general 2020-07-01 17:26:28 ugh nvm i can't find it
general 2020-07-01 17:26:54 python + golang are good for OOP in my opinion
general 2020-07-01 17:27:21 does lua have classes or structs or something? i guess you could use workspace objects but not really the same
general 2020-07-01 17:27:27 object orientated programming
general 2020-07-01 17:27:47 ah
general 2020-07-01 17:28:00 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:08 i mean, logic gates would be the coolest thing ever added to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:13 but yeah, hardcoded
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:15 no but
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:53 with wiring + gates you could build stuff like automated landing systems, drones, navigation systems, docking systems
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:36:31 *will* take months, even up to a year
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:33 are you in PVP mode?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:54 nope, those should work anywhere
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:34 hm, that's odd
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:41 press F9 and see if there's any red text
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:59 he's in pvp mode

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:14:22 no, he's permabanned
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:15:03 multiple instances of posting NSFW, lots of modlogs. then the finale was that he exploited in front of 3 staff members on a full vip 1 server
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:15:53 the truth is that we didn't really care if he posted videos on youtube of him exploiting
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:15:57 it doesn't involve us
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:16:16 it's when it involves this server that we have to do something
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:16:30 in a better place
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:16:51 well, we were going to give him a chance to rejoin in 6 months
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:16:58 but yeah then he exploited in front of 3 mods on vip 1
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:17:02 and that was that
general 2020-07-01 19:36:26

general 2020-07-02 19:07:42 that explains it
general 2020-07-02 19:47:12 <@!192861290677534722> are you good at maths and orbital mechanics? I need help ;c

general 2020-07-02 20:02:17 the COM and COL were close enough together to allow for flight, there were engines and control surfaces, and rockets as well so I just assume it can fly. no point bothering people for that when it's that clear
general 2020-07-02 20:02:22 and yeah he posted helium count
general 2020-07-02 20:11:40 silence, mortal !!
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:13:06 again?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:13:12 for the love of god it hasn't even been a week
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:13:22 do we know who leaked them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:14:31 doesn't look like an alt
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:15:14 it would be possible it wasn't leaked, but someone on the discord is using it as an alt so they don't personally ruin their reputation
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:15:34 ohhhh right
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:15:42 i thought you meant that was the guy on the server, mb
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:17:59 oh for fuck's sake, someone's intentionally going around distributing them
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:28:04 last *year*
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:28:11 that can't be right
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:28:22 must have been <7 days ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:30:24 don't remember tbh
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:31:36 yeah there are a couple of things in <#623337136267067393> about him actually
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:02 yeah i don't have any more leads ;/
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:07 he's not friends with vip or anything
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:23 just going to have to wait until he accepts my FR so i can message him

the-dump 2020-07-03 08:25:00 but if you think the-dump is bad then contest-chat worse
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:14 sometimes warnings need to be given out but I'm against judging mods based on modlogs because it leads to this
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:33 not necessarily true
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:44 yes
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:27:27 not what I've seen
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:28:42 I mean, take jameson. defo one of the best mods, not because he handed out lots of modlogs, because he was good at talking to people and making them understand why they shouldn't do what they did
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:29:07 ruling with an iron fist isn't always the answer

general 2020-07-03 14:33:19 what hof
general 2020-07-03 14:33:28 you need 60 upvotes lol
general 2020-07-03 14:33:41 it was 40
general 2020-07-03 14:33:56 
general 2020-07-03 14:34:11 nah 60+ is fine with the number of people voting
general 2020-07-03 14:34:18 the vip-general voting system on the other hand is not fine
general 2020-07-03 14:34:46 lol
general 2020-07-03 14:34:50 .
general 2020-07-03 14:35:03 no need to be like that
general 2020-07-03 14:35:25 thanks c;
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:57 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:07:30 acceleration gives an object more kinetic energy?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:08:18 applying a force to an object gives you acceleration increases the kinetic energy, amiright?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:08:35 momentum
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:10 afaik, photons have no mass but have momentum, is that right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:47 i am also scripting gravity. fight me >:)
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:25 so presumably that's how they can travel at the, well, speed of light?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:33 why not any faster?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:42 sorry if it's a dumb question
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:46 idk too much about physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:56 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:13:32 if light travels faster than light we can't see it 🤯
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:14:13 you can also become a black hole
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:16:18 you get access to a <#519624169730605086> channel with expert+ ranks
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:17:04 people wanted to be able to choose their colours but we wanted the ranks to show a progression recognisable from looking at their name
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:17:11 this was a good compromise
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:19:28 valyrian, idk if you'd be able to help with this, but I'm programming a simulation of a solar system by simulating gravity between every planet (i think it's called n-body but not sure). how would you define the periapsis and apoapsis for each body? would it be enough to just calculate it for the main influencing body?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:19:46 oh frick this isn't general
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:19:48 k let's go there
general 2020-07-03 19:20:56 ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:21:46 I have the simulation all done. it's on a 2D plane as of rn though
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:21:55 golang because speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:23:13 https://repl.it/@LordIdra/solarsystem
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:23:33 it takes a while to build
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:25:32 it's built for ease of use and speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:25:34 really nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:25:58 coming from python the biggest thing about it is having to convert between types all the time
general 2020-07-03 19:28:57 <@!599576050665652236> yeah, I've done a tiny tiny bit of java but don't remember the type conversion being this bad. I think it's mostly because different functions and different libraries need different types - particularly float32 and float64 - and it's a pain to not have automatic conversion
general 2020-07-03 19:29:16 2d game library which I'm abusing for vector graphics
general 2020-07-03 19:29:28 it uses the GPU and everything so I think I'm in the clear tho
general 2020-07-03 19:30:09 👋
general 2020-07-03 19:30:52 totally not the first thing I tried
general 2020-07-03 19:31:21 I know the apoapsis and the velocity (as a vector) at the apoapsis and from that I want to get the periapsis
general 2020-07-03 19:31:57 and the python discord spat this out at me
general 2020-07-03 19:32:30 it took me like an hour to understand what's going on
general 2020-07-03 19:34:27 if you want to make it really realistic, remember the kinetic energy = (1/2) * mass * velocity^2
general 2020-07-03 19:34:39 then use kinetic energy rather than mass
general 2020-07-03 19:34:56 nah his own project I believe
general 2020-07-03 19:35:43 i can't voice chat, sorry
general 2020-07-03 19:35:56 we can talk here, or too much to type?
general 2020-07-03 19:37:00 yea, that's probably not going to be realistic then since everything breaks to some degree irl
general 2020-07-03 19:37:13 but I'd still suggest using formula for kinetic energy and comparing that to the mass
general 2020-07-03 19:37:35 yes
general 2020-07-03 19:37:39 use relative velocity
general 2020-07-03 19:38:06 how can you get velocity? as a vector or?
general 2020-07-03 19:38:09 in studio
general 2020-07-03 19:38:23 well you'd need to work out the direction too
general 2020-07-03 19:38:33 how to suggest
general 2020-07-03 19:38:54 because if they were moving toward each other the impact would be much faster than if one was moving away from the other
general 2020-07-03 19:39:41 can you get the velocity of each object as a vector?
general 2020-07-03 19:40:26 ???
general 2020-07-03 19:40:29 no the velocity
general 2020-07-03 19:40:42 the velocity, or momentum if you like, of the object
general 2020-07-03 19:40:58 what
general 2020-07-03 19:41:25 no but
general 2020-07-03 19:41:33 the objects are *moving in a direction at a speed*
general 2020-07-03 19:41:40 can you get that direction and speed as a vector?
general 2020-07-03 19:42:00 what's the vector relative to?
general 2020-07-03 19:42:26 wdym?
general 2020-07-03 19:42:58 ok so, if an object is moving at (2, 4, 0) then what is the vector it returns
general 2020-07-03 19:43:08 WAIT
general 2020-07-03 19:43:10 you mean on
general 2020-07-03 19:43:17 an X, Y, Z axis?
general 2020-07-03 19:43:22 ok perfect
general 2020-07-03 19:43:42 just subtract the velocity vector of the second object from the first object
general 2020-07-03 19:43:53 and that'll give you the difference in speed, or relative velocity
general 2020-07-03 19:44:26 then to get the total speed just add the x y and z of resulting vector together
general 2020-07-03 19:44:28 does that make sense?
general 2020-07-03 19:46:05 ok so. say that object 1 is moving at (0, 0, 3) and object 2 is moving at (0, 0, 1). it's safe to say that the relative speed is (0, 0, 2) right?
general 2020-07-03 19:46:38 what
general 2020-07-03 19:46:41 so it isn't a vector
general 2020-07-03 19:46:54 .............
general 2020-07-03 19:46:55 bruh
general 2020-07-03 19:46:58 BRUH
general 2020-07-03 19:47:27 i've spent the last 10 minutes rambling based on you saying that you can get the velocity as a vector
general 2020-07-03 19:47:34 wait, do you know what a vector is?
general 2020-07-03 19:48:02 ok but
general 2020-07-03 19:48:13 does magnitude take into account the direction of the objects
general 2020-07-03 19:48:15 or just the speed?
general 2020-07-03 19:48:41 what?
general 2020-07-03 19:49:33 correct, it was hardcoded by madattak a few years ago and then promptly abandoned due to irl stuff, then taken over by rickje who worked on it until now when the code is no longer readable
general 2020-07-03 19:50:15 that's the plan
general 2020-07-03 19:50:19 just don't expect it soon
general 2020-07-03 19:50:49 there's no 'they' - madattak doesn't work on this game and rickje isn't part of innovation inc
general 2020-07-03 19:51:12 in the same direction or?
general 2020-07-03 19:51:26 how tf does that work
general 2020-07-03 19:51:36 what is repetitive velocity?
general 2020-07-03 19:52:09 i see
general 2020-07-03 19:52:34 ok. does that take into account the direction tho
general 2020-07-03 19:53:21 yes
general 2020-07-03 19:53:27 that's what I proposed
general 2020-07-03 19:53:31 ok so
general 2020-07-03 19:53:42 add the X Y and Z of the final vector together
general 2020-07-03 19:53:46 that'll give you total velocity
general 2020-07-03 19:54:33 then apply (1/2) * mass * (velocity^2)
general 2020-07-03 19:54:37 and that's the energy
general 2020-07-03 19:54:52 so you've applied that equation
general 2020-07-03 19:55:04 to get the energy output
general 2020-07-03 19:55:36 well, the amount of energy needed to break an object isn't really a thing IRL
general 2020-07-03 19:56:07 so you would need to do that yourself - maybe x*mass or something like that, where X is the strength of the material
general 2020-07-03 19:56:48 but keep in mind X = 1 would mean that a planet wouldn't need to be moving very fast at all to break another one - in fact anything over 0 would do
general 2020-07-03 19:57:00 so i'd set it pretty high depending on the scale of your planets
general 2020-07-03 19:57:32 how to suggest
general 2020-07-03 19:57:35 ^^
general 2020-07-03 19:58:00 rickje is actively developing plane crazy
general 2020-07-03 19:58:06 he's not part of innovation inc in any way
general 2020-07-03 19:59:02 what
general 2020-07-03 19:59:11 rickje didn't make innovation inc spaceship did he?
general 2020-07-03 19:59:17 lol
general 2020-07-03 19:59:26 bruh
general 2020-07-03 19:59:46 yes
general 2020-07-03 20:00:08 velocity will be squared so it grows exponentially
general 2020-07-03 20:00:45 as velocity grows its effect on the total energy is exponential
general 2020-07-03 20:00:48 yes you do
general 2020-07-03 20:01:03 wha
general 2020-07-03 20:01:29 yes
general 2020-07-03 20:01:36 the big planet has a lot of energy
general 2020-07-03 20:01:38 it has high mass
general 2020-07-03 20:02:06 no
general 2020-07-03 20:02:10 bruh
general 2020-07-03 20:02:13 bruh.
general 2020-07-03 20:02:17 ok so
general 2020-07-03 20:02:52 the amount of energy that a planet has as it hits another planet is calculated. then, if that energy is over the tolerance of the planet that it hits, the planet it hits should be destroyed
general 2020-07-03 20:02:58 no
general 2020-07-03 20:03:50 by that logic dropping a ball on earth should destroy the planet
general 2020-07-03 20:04:12 what are you talking about
general 2020-07-03 20:04:36 if the planet that hits the big planet has enough energy, it will destroy the big planet as well
general 2020-07-03 20:04:47 yes
general 2020-07-03 20:06:03 can you just
general 2020-07-03 20:06:07 show me the equations you're using
general 2020-07-03 20:06:09 in the script
general 2020-07-03 20:06:21 actually nvm i gtg now
general 2020-07-03 20:07:14 i think it's a problem with the velocity but like i said gtg, have fun

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:07:15 foolish of you to assume rickje's working on wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:17:05 sry, but last time we tried this (in fact I was the host) we had a map contest. the winning map was actually really good, but rickje just consistently ignored my messages about it and eventually I just gave up
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:18:02 it would have taken a fair amount of time to add it but nothing more than adding some new parts. i don't know why he kept ignoring my messages to this day
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:19:24 i don't think it's a case of being lazy, just refusing to talk about why he wouldn't do it because he knew he'd probably lose the argument ;/ honestly idk

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:06:57 i don't doubt your building skills, it's just... if this wasn't accepted, idk what will be
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:07:59 you could always keep building your map and use it as a base for your own game?

plane-crazy 2020-07-06 18:24:51 because there are a fair number of pictures and i don't want to flood this channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 18:26:40 the colour scheme is big dumb, don't judge, it was a long time ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 18:26:47 just imagine that it's dark gray and red and stuff

general 2020-07-07 13:47:13 lol our school is doing online exams and people are judging teachers by reacting to their messages with angry faces if they dislike them
general 2020-07-07 13:47:22 our maths teacher is currently losing the fight
general 2020-07-07 13:47:57 other half's teacher is doing well though
general 2020-07-07 13:52:13 last week he kicked some guy out of our virtual lesson for saying 'the beauty of maths' or something like that
general 2020-07-07 13:52:21 and i don't think anyone is standing for it
general 2020-07-07 14:25:06 we're doing maths exam and someone just posted this in the group chat
bug-reports 2020-07-07 15:31:48 ^

general 2020-07-08 11:50:28 so we're doing our spanish exam and the teachers forgot to disable editing for the shared document on teams

general 2020-07-09 14:34:27 jesus christ
general 2020-07-09 14:34:39 that's kinda worrying
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 14:48:18 counting exploits or not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 14:50:38 i mean, someone wrote a script that placed every single block in the game, totalling 100k+ iirc
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 14:50:47 but beyond that there's no way you can get a tangible answer
general 2020-07-09 16:48:35 oh i forgot about bss
general 2020-07-09 16:48:38 i'm still in the server
general 2020-07-09 16:49:40 mmm tanks
general 2020-07-09 16:50:36 
general 2020-07-09 16:50:58 it's lame but the admins will probably take the bait
general 2020-07-09 16:51:08 knowing that server
general 2020-07-09 16:52:09 they literally have rules to protect undes from nasty content
general 2020-07-09 16:52:13 ...such as tanks...
general 2020-07-09 16:52:33 yes
general 2020-07-09 16:52:34 sarcasm
general 2020-07-09 16:52:36 ?
general 2020-07-09 16:53:23 let me say that
general 2020-07-09 16:54:38 yes but they have rules that are actively based around the fact that they KNOW there are undes in the server
general 2020-07-09 16:55:40 LOL THEY ACTUALLY DELETED 'my grandpa fought in ww2'
general 2020-07-09 16:56:19 i don't want to get banned yet

general 2020-07-09 17:09:19 plane crazy was an experiment/prototype
general 2020-07-09 17:09:33 it wasn't meant to be long term or popular
general 2020-07-09 17:09:36 then that happened

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 18:22:57 i think someone's used VR before but i can't tell you for sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 18:26:21 pretty sure the mod team wanted to ban him for a bit before realising he wasn't exploiting lol
general 2020-07-09 19:32:13 daily news from BSS #2
general 2020-07-09 19:45:07 i fail to understand what's going on here
general 2020-07-09 19:45:39 wait... wait... another piece to the puzzle
general 2020-07-09 21:25:01 uyivwmfuiyhwiu
general 2020-07-09 21:25:15 'hacking transport protocol'
general 2020-07-09 21:26:40 ^
general 2020-07-09 21:26:54 the rank requirement is in place for a reason
general 2020-07-09 21:26:55 <#609442446249820211>
general 2020-07-09 21:28:17 honestly I think that pc2 is going to be in the works soon as opposed to pc1 updates since the code is getting so hard to work with
general 2020-07-09 21:28:57 we had an entire map contest for this and when I messaged rickje he flat out ignored me
general 2020-07-09 21:29:05 it was a fantastic map too
general 2020-07-09 21:29:16 met all the requirements
general 2020-07-09 21:30:56 well this is what your hard work amounted to, until I left pcc
general 2020-07-09 21:34:01 ima ask him again
general 2020-07-09 21:34:03 here goes
general 2020-07-09 21:34:17 because
general 2020-07-09 21:36:46 i messed rickje again about the map thing
general 2020-07-09 21:37:00 hopefully i can at least get a reason
general 2020-07-09 21:37:06 ok thank you vixxage
general 2020-07-09 21:39:48 the issue is it's very tough to merge terrain
general 2020-07-09 21:39:53 no plugin for it
general 2020-07-09 21:41:09 we had an entire map contest with like 30 people participating
general 2020-07-09 21:41:11 and it amounts
general 2020-07-09 21:41:12 to nothing
general 2020-07-09 21:41:13 ;-;
general 2020-07-09 21:44:42 it do be beautiful tho
general 2020-07-09 21:59:22 if *only*
general 2020-07-09 22:03:18 remember
general 2020-07-09 22:03:19 you started this
general 2020-07-09 22:03:21 mmmmm
general 2020-07-09 22:03:23 m m
general 2020-07-09 22:03:31 you cannot take it back

general 2020-07-09 22:04:57 you just ruined my childhood in 4 different ways
general 2020-07-09 22:06:04 look outside at 3am tomorrow 🙂
general 2020-07-09 22:06:08 the tooth fairy may not be real
general 2020-07-09 22:06:13 the map leak may not be real
general 2020-07-09 22:06:16 but death motor is
general 2020-07-09 22:21:22 fuck
general 2020-07-09 22:21:30 no

general 2020-07-09 22:32:17 yes
general 2020-07-09 22:32:22 what art thou require?
general 2020-07-09 22:33:55 we can't do anything about that unfortunately
general 2020-07-09 22:33:59 no ingame moderation system
general 2020-07-09 22:34:19 no
general 2020-07-09 22:34:23 they both have trust issues
general 2020-07-09 22:34:40 unlikely
general 2020-07-09 22:35:34 we had a <#623337136267067393> channel, it's closed now because rick literally couldn't handle the reports/wasn't doing anything about them
general 2020-07-09 22:35:46 so i would just switch server and report them to roblox
general 2020-07-09 22:35:50 both
general 2020-07-09 22:35:50 they
general 2020-07-09 22:35:51 do
general 2020-07-09 22:35:54 problem solved
general 2020-07-09 22:36:16 oh wait
general 2020-07-09 22:36:24 that thing where someone summoned him through black magic
general 2020-07-09 22:36:36 and they talked about grilling garlic bread or something

general 2020-07-10 12:28:48 DO IT
general 2020-07-10 12:36:59 this pisses me off
general 2020-07-10 12:37:03 it varies from language to language
general 2020-07-10 12:38:37 .
general 2020-07-10 12:38:42 am i just really stupid
general 2020-07-10 12:38:55 or is this supposed to be correct
general 2020-07-10 12:39:39 yeah it's right here
general 2020-07-10 12:39:44 i'm so done with this exam lmao
general 2020-07-10 12:40:38 yes thank you megalodon
general 2020-07-10 12:40:46 love you too honey
general 2020-07-10 13:14:58 here's why no new map
general 2020-07-10 13:16:09 low poly map contest when
general 2020-07-10 15:43:13 damn, I love reading documentation out of context
general 2020-07-10 15:44:04 ***y e s***
general 2020-07-10 15:55:52 .
general 2020-07-10 16:56:56 hold the fuck u[
general 2020-07-10 16:56:58 mad was
general 2020-07-10 16:57:00 talking?
general 2020-07-10 16:57:15 talk about broken promises
general 2020-07-10 17:17:50 spaceships are fun
general 2020-07-10 17:18:04 VTOL rank counts though, depending on how you make it fly
general 2020-07-10 17:18:14 how to suggest
general 2020-07-10 17:19:04 the problem is, how'd you classify a spaceship? it's a bit loosely defined, you could make it fly with gravity slider or helium etc
general 2020-07-10 17:19:16 i-
general 2020-07-10 17:19:36 fuck you *takes out kettle*
general 2020-07-10 17:20:00 there is always tea time
general 2020-07-10 17:20:16 then we'd have to implement all forms of themed ranks tho
general 2020-07-10 17:20:27 and it's very difficult to measure something like that as well
general 2020-07-10 17:22:08 because plane crazy r-
general 2020-07-10 17:22:13 oh wait, it's supposed to be secret
general 2020-07-10 17:22:27 the re
general 2020-07-10 17:22:46 there's no alpha rank
general 2020-07-10 17:23:01 hmm
general 2020-07-10 17:23:45 i mean, I very commonly use wing panels in my spacecraft, very useful for decoration and stability
general 2020-07-10 17:24:19 go ahead
general 2020-07-10 17:25:09 honestly, I probably won't be able to help, not good with animals or noses
general 2020-07-10 17:25:41 so, just uses helium and engines - no wing panels or gravity slider?
general 2020-07-10 17:26:05 so, a blimp rank
general 2020-07-10 17:26:40 it's... very hard to build something stable without using wing panels or helium
general 2020-07-10 17:26:48 I don't think any people would go for it
general 2020-07-10 17:26:55 >>stable<<
general 2020-07-10 17:27:12 post videos
general 2020-07-10 17:27:19 I'm legitimately curious
general 2020-07-10 17:28:28 yes, i know
general 2020-07-10 17:28:32 i built countless of those
general 2020-07-10 17:28:53 it's just that most people aren't going to enjoy building something like that, nor will they want to -
general 2020-07-10 17:28:55 er
general 2020-07-10 17:28:56 no thanks
general 2020-07-10 17:29:49 as a challenge rank, it might work but i don't think many people will do it
general 2020-07-10 17:30:03 i personally prefer using every block
general 2020-07-10 17:30:16 stuff like this
general 2020-07-10 17:30:18 flies on helium
general 2020-07-10 17:30:50 a starship
general 2020-07-10 17:31:05 here's another in similar style
general 2020-07-10 17:31:26 nah, my own design entirely
general 2020-07-10 17:31:28 and yes that's correct
general 2020-07-10 17:31:47 makes something useful from those idiots and their tea dumping
general 2020-07-10 17:33:07 in theory yeah
general 2020-07-10 17:33:24 but i find it fun to incorporate the flight mechanism into the aesthetics themselves
general 2020-07-10 17:33:32 for example the engines as RCS thrusters
general 2020-07-10 17:33:53 ??
general 2020-07-10 17:34:13 no
general 2020-07-10 17:34:21 i believe you can do that, i never said you couldn't
general 2020-07-10 17:34:22 😛
general 2020-07-10 17:34:27 i'm just stating my preference
general 2020-07-10 17:34:48 spaceship battle
general 2020-07-10 17:35:36 tbh I've kinda stopped building spaceships in plane crazy
general 2020-07-10 17:35:55 building a few in build n destroy now
general 2020-07-10 17:36:00 finished this today

general 2020-07-10 17:40:02 fuck you
general 2020-07-10 17:40:32 thank you
general 2020-07-10 17:40:46 ok now enjoy passing the <#544722974574379021> vote
general 2020-07-10 17:42:37 actually I tried to consider that when designing the ranks but it's just way too hard
general 2020-07-10 17:42:40 so we have designer ranks
general 2020-07-10 17:42:42 enjoy
general 2020-07-10 18:20:03

general 2020-07-10 18:20:13 iusmhgaiuwehuighiuewa
general 2020-07-10 19:23:10 what's going on now?
general 2020-07-10 19:23:34 perfect description
general 2020-07-10 19:24:03 <@456226577798135808> please don't try to instigate arguments, keep it in DM's if you want to insult someone
general 2020-07-10 19:25:07 I mean, that's fair enough, but pinging someone and telling them that no one likes them really isn't the way to do it
general 2020-07-10 19:27:18 ...
general 2020-07-10 19:27:47 ^
general 2020-07-10 19:28:10 it's literally impossible to get past verification if you're 13+
general 2020-07-10 19:28:24 <13* shush
general 2020-07-10 19:29:04 hold on just gonna check who verified, clear this mess up
general 2020-07-10 19:30:29 obc verified him, he's basically the last person who would neglect checking if they're 13+. there are other ways to do it such as voice chat
general 2020-07-10 19:31:52 I really don't know enough about what happened on youtube to be judge on this, but from what it looks you guys are really being overly harsh and trying to get him banned
general 2020-07-10 19:32:23 you pinged him and told him he has no friends, what the hell did you expect?
general 2020-07-10 19:32:45 why would I ban him?
general 2020-07-10 19:33:46 you can't prove that he's underage. if you want to get him banned, instead of ranting at his face in <#497142796961054721>, why don't you compile your evidence and make a reasonable argument? maybe then you would have a chance.
general 2020-07-10 19:34:20 no, but i trust obc to have checked
general 2020-07-10 19:34:54 so, if you think it's bannable make a document with all those images and send it to a moderator. doing what you're doing is not helping your cause
general 2020-07-10 19:35:15 you just want him banned
general 2020-07-10 19:37:23 look, guys. when someone's account is <13 then moderators/admins HAVE to get proper proof like voice evidence. you are not going to convince me to do anything like this. if you want to take action, do it with your brain, not your emotions - compile all your evidence and send it to a moderator for review
general 2020-07-10 19:38:32 I can't do VC. <@!195253906333368320> are you free for a few moments
general 2020-07-10 19:39:27 rpg would you be ok to prove you're over 13 through voicechat to OBC for the sake of convincing them that you're not <13?
general 2020-07-10 19:40:10 it won't take a minute
general 2020-07-10 19:41:14 <@!527730958741405725> are you able to VC then?
general 2020-07-10 19:44:03 👍 thanks
general 2020-07-10 19:46:11 ^
general 2020-07-10 19:46:41 OBC voice chatted and said he sounded 14-15
general 2020-07-10 19:47:57 here we go again 🙄
general 2020-07-10 19:55:52 ^
general 2020-07-10 20:05:03 ping !

creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:55:33 this is the most ridiculous thing i have seen in a while
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:55:50 who the fuck goes to the effort of doing all this
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:56:03 just
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:56:49 i messaged rick about a new map earlier, it's not coming anytime soon, it would be a ton of work to implement, but a better map *is* coming in the future
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:57:27 yeah something like that
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:57:28 problem?
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:57:44 it's hardly his fault
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:57:48 the game is incredibly hard to work on
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:57:57 it's a legitimate excuse
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:58:15 ^
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:58:59 something better is in the works but it won't be done for a while 😉
creations-chat 2020-07-10 20:59:36 i mean, the entire mod team including me has leaked it at some point but rickje told me not to leak it

general 2020-07-10 22:05:17 abstract art in a nutshell
creations-chat 2020-07-10 22:06:25 it's 1) exploiting 2) impersonating rick
creations-chat 2020-07-10 22:06:30 both of which are bannable
creations-chat 2020-07-10 22:06:38 so mods went 🔨
general 2020-07-10 22:07:00 above is noob !
general 2020-07-10 22:08:14 why did this randomly, quietly open in the background without me touching the keyboard
general 2020-07-10 22:08:18 i'm scared
general 2020-07-10 22:09:02 yeah maybe my computer is just slow as shit
help 2020-07-10 22:17:04 no damnit 😠
general 2020-07-10 22:36:53 i'm a **noob** according to that because I often build scenery, and when I build vehicles they use helium and engines 😤
plane-crazy 2020-07-10 22:38:05 lemme join
plane-crazy 2020-07-10 22:38:07 don't tell them tho

general 2020-07-10 22:48:45 now
general 2020-07-10 22:49:29 Aessbeater6t9 is exploiting, we need links refreshed
general 2020-07-10 22:51:31 thanks
general 2020-07-10 22:51:53 DM me or obc links
general 2020-07-10 22:52:18 i have an emerging suspicion that's prototrode but idk
general 2020-07-10 22:53:57 yeah that's my thinking
general 2020-07-10 22:54:32 when an admin comes online, i think obc is AFK right now
general 2020-07-10 22:55:35 .
bot-central 2020-07-10 22:56:10 i'll tell ya'll when servers are back
bot-central 2020-07-10 22:56:22 I don't have access to bot dashboard so an admin has to do it
general 2020-07-10 22:57:22 wait, you have?
general 2020-07-10 22:57:48 hang on, does anyone know about what time he joined the server?
general 2020-07-10 22:58:01 probably not
general 2020-07-10 22:59:41 i gotta admit i kinda feel bad for him
general 2020-07-10 23:00:05 he was smart, used that to his advantage and created really cool stuff
general 2020-07-10 23:01:26 yes, also true
general 2020-07-10 23:01:36 and no, i don't know who he is
general 2020-07-10 23:01:41 there's no ingame moderation
general 2020-07-10 23:04:19 we're considering it
general 2020-07-10 23:04:43 would you guys rather have a separate server, or raise the overall requirements?
general 2020-07-10 23:04:57 the former wouldn't fix the exploiter problem is my main concern
general 2020-07-10 23:05:21 mmmmmm
general 2020-07-10 23:05:35 
general 2020-07-10 23:06:12 oh, it is?
bot-central 2020-07-10 23:06:19 !servers
general 2020-07-10 23:07:26 that's the other problem with separate servers
general 2020-07-10 23:07:29 no one would use them...
general 2020-07-10 23:12:26 yeah
general 2020-07-10 23:12:39 in theory any admin with access to the mee6 dashboard should be able to do it
general 2020-07-10 23:12:42 but idk
general 2020-07-10 23:14:55 ...
general 2020-07-10 23:19:31 bruh

plane-crazy 2020-07-12 14:44:03 i know that it's possible ._.
general 2020-07-12 14:54:22 *roblox knows*

general 2020-07-12 14:55:12 which mod knows about anime...
general 2020-07-12 14:56:14 i'm not enough of a... uh... anime fan... to know if that's ok or not

plane-crazy 2020-07-13 12:57:20 you can't assume just because someone downvoted your creation, they're doing it to win
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 12:57:49 maybe he genuinely just doesn't like it for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 12:58:54 and this is the *problem* with this idiotic contest topic
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 12:59:14 post-apocalytpic is closely associated with dystopian
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 12:59:42 that's not true
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:00:01 there is tons of post-apocalyptic media out there which involves a society
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:00:04 just not as we know it
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:01:05 you can classify post-apocalyptic as dystopian. i mean, nuclear weapons blowing everyone up or smth is hardly going to result in a nice place
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:01:37 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDeMzg31T2I

plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:05:13 post apocalyptic classifies as dystopian
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:06:59 try posting it in <#384025409945337856> then
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:07:46 i do have to agree though, that building something from real life/modern society and then just putting some dystopian/post-apocalyptic backstory onto it shouldn't really be allowed for this contest. not saying it isn't a good build
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:08:58 well, admittedly the build itself does not convey any dystopian or post-apocalyptic vibes at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:09:56 how does this look dystopian tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:10:07 just looks like a normal helicopter to me
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:11:05 ^
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:11:32 honestly i don't think it's a good contest topic at all, way too vague and not thought through at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:11:41 because arguments like this happen
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:12:04 but if they don't think it looks dystopian - they are perfectly entitled to downvote it
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:13:16 look - we all have different perspectives on this. different people are going to interpret it in different ways. if they don't think it looks dystopian, *they don't have to think it's dystopian.*
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:13:22 there is no one definition
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:14:25 why does it matter????
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:14:34 let's not
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:14:38 bypass
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:14:39 like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:15:32 uhh, idk whether this should be a verbal or dyno warn ;/
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:16:00 so I'll let you off with verbal, next time it will be dyno, now let's move on
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:19:13 alright, mod guide said I should warn
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:19:25 *now let's move on*
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:19:48 welcome to hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:21:15 there's a warn from about 2-3 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:21:31 that's all
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:22:05 yes..
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:23:43 *kills yousuf*
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:23:47 fun roleplay 👍
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:24:52 oh for goodness sake
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:25:06 look, let's just stop this pointless argument. the matter is dealt with
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:34:15 nowhere
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:34:20 no ingame moderation unfortunately
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:34:29 I would just switch server
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:34:55 and then there's just rolijok

creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:49:11 centre of lift in centre of mass
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:49:16 same as with planes, but vertically
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:50:06 a rocket with centre of lift below the centre of mass will always point down, above will always try to point up, in the middle.. neither
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:50:22 it gets tough with staging though
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:53:51 each stage needs to keep the centre of lift in line with the centre of mass
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:54:50 yeah. but keep in mind that when you separate stages, centre of mass is going to shift
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:55:24 so centre of lift also needs to shift
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:57:17 this is a really awful drawing, but with no stages separated the centre of mass (green dot) and lift (black dot) are going to be in the same place, right?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:57:57 but if the second stage were on its own -
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:58:02 they wouldn't be in line
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:04 just think in terms of stages instead of the whole rocket. try to balance each stage individually (line centre of mass up with lift)
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:22 um, not sure, I think so
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:23 lemme check
creations-chat 2020-07-13 23:00:15 yes, they do count

plane-crazy 2020-07-14 11:16:36 fishing boats are cool, you can make variations on fishing boats, fishing trawlers or a fleet of small ships, nets, rods etc
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 11:16:45 just my opinion

general 2020-07-14 18:30:10 next person to speak in spanish gets warned without question
general 2020-07-14 18:30:12 now
general 2020-07-14 18:30:14 *shut*
general 2020-07-14 18:30:26 ...
general 2020-07-14 18:31:24 I dm'ed you
general 2020-07-14 18:33:40 <@!724461096349728824> I looked it up, it's a curse/slang word that still translates to something inappropriate
general 2020-07-14 18:34:18 this is *exactly* why we don't allow spanish in chat.
general 2020-07-14 18:35:58 <@!724461096349728824> I'm removing your warn because several people have said that it's not inappropriate, but **this is why you don't speak other languages in chat**
general 2020-07-14 18:36:39 now, i really fucking need to eat, if anyone has broken any rules when I come back they *will* be warned
general 2020-07-14 18:51:48 ?reason 6728 continuing to talk in spanish after being warned not to multiple times
general 2020-07-14 18:51:53 ugh
general 2020-07-14 18:52:00 read
general 2020-07-14 18:52:02 the warn
general 2020-07-14 18:52:32 
general 2020-07-14 18:52:49 no, that wasn't before
general 2020-07-14 18:53:23 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/732666892493258782
general 2020-07-14 18:53:35 here's when I said that
general 2020-07-14 18:53:38 scroll down from there
general 2020-07-14 18:53:47 the rules are in place for a reason
general 2020-07-14 18:54:02 you can't speak in other languages because moderators can't moderate it, as was evidenced earlier
general 2020-07-14 18:54:15 if you'd read the rules you would know
general 2020-07-14 18:54:29 
general 2020-07-14 18:54:43 that doesn't excuse you from following the rules
general 2020-07-14 18:55:17 and?
general 2020-07-14 18:55:46 that *isn't the point*
general 2020-07-14 18:55:54 ^
general 2020-07-14 18:56:08 there are pages and pages of you conversing in spanish
general 2020-07-14 18:56:30 in case you didn't notice, I warned dio as well
general 2020-07-14 18:56:35 you two were the main ones
general 2020-07-14 18:56:42 no, I changed the reason
general 2020-07-14 18:58:12 kurzgesagtd said literally 3-4 messages in spanish after the warn, you were practically flooding the chat. this isn't debatable ;/
help 2020-07-14 19:01:05 that's actually pretty decent

general 2020-07-15 12:13:04 <:NotFunny:602000308154925057>

general 2020-07-15 12:19:56 destroy vip 1
general 2020-07-15 12:20:07 at the cost of, what, a few plebs?
general 2020-07-15 12:21:30 leave that to other staff, idk what's going on really
general 2020-07-15 12:21:45 and also we can't confirm it's his alt
general 2020-07-15 12:21:57 did he?
general 2020-07-15 12:22:00 well there you go
general 2020-07-15 12:22:05 i don't know what's going on
general 2020-07-15 12:22:06 now shut
general 2020-07-15 12:22:29 the other staff are discussing it
general 2020-07-15 12:22:34 also i have a lesson in like 3 minutes
general 2020-07-15 12:26:10 i deleted his verified role >:)
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 14:22:58 did someone say british?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 14:23:48 ok bye bye !
general 2020-07-15 15:24:20 <@456226577798135808> join the club
the first time I went to the moon I tried to land with a parachute
general 2020-07-15 15:24:39 in KSP but same level of ridiculousness
general 2020-07-15 15:25:21 *shut*
general 2020-07-15 15:25:32 it was like 5 years ago
general 2020-07-15 15:26:00 nah, always brought landing engines and just used chutes to slow down
general 2020-07-15 15:26:02 bruh
general 2020-07-15 15:26:43 last time I tried to land on eve my lander glitched into oblivion and I couldn't reload the quicksave
general 2020-07-15 15:28:55 well it's probably more because you're posting in <#497142796961054721> when there's a <#384021699466756107> channel
general 2020-07-15 15:29:42 ok?
general 2020-07-15 16:47:53 leaving staff too for 10k 👍
general 2020-07-15 16:49:12 idk man
general 2020-07-15 16:50:37 no
general 2020-07-15 16:58:31 <@!195253906333368320> truly sorry about what happened, I agree that rick's actions were consistently toxic and didn't help anything. you were a fantastic admin, and didn't deserve this
general 2020-07-15 16:59:25 tbh I might leave too. there's no changing rick's mind
general 2020-07-15 17:01:31 he's not a bad developer, he just has no idea how people work ;/
general 2020-07-15 17:02:42 man literally asked me if he should fire voxel, not even gonna worry about leaking dms anymore because community is burning anyways
general 2020-07-15 17:03:28 yup
general 2020-07-15 17:06:33 <@!252094891448860673> fuck this, I'm done
general 2020-07-15 17:06:37 i step down
general 2020-07-15 17:07:07 yeah, I can't work with someone like this
general 2020-07-15 17:08:37 i mean, there's no point staying here if there are massive arguments between the entire staff team vs rick every other week
general 2020-07-15 17:10:39 it's just beyond the point of being a moderator. I've talked to rick about this in DM's, and he flat out responded by asking if he should fire people - he's clearly not changing his mind. and while I respect him as a human who needs to be treated fairly and has a life too, his decisions have been appalling
general 2020-07-15 17:12:41 I didn't resign to make things worse or as a sign to rick, wtf. i did it because i don't want to deal with rick's bullshit as the other 1/2 of being a moderator ;/
general 2020-07-15 17:15:46 i haven't even been back as a mod for 2 months, I thought that rick was in the right, after all what he was saying made sense. and it's true that the game is hard to work on but rick just isn't helping at all with all he's saying
general 2020-07-15 17:17:08 blackbird - OBC literally coded him an entire moderation system and he didn't implement it because it would break the game, then refused to prove it. (am I allowed to say that? whatever, can't ask the mods now)
general 2020-07-15 17:35:54 oh did synthetic leave too?
general 2020-07-15 17:36:01 @22_synthetic
general 2020-07-15 17:36:19 ah, I see
general 2020-07-15 17:36:43 janitor is rick's job
general 2020-07-15 17:38:12 it's school roleplay but rick is corrupt administration
general 2020-07-15 17:38:25 damn
general 2020-07-15 17:39:28 you can't just 'stop bringing up the drama'
general 2020-07-15 17:41:10 <@!217336009455566848> can we have a statement, people want to know your side of what happened. community is dying rn, just saying
general 2020-07-15 17:41:18 ping
general 2020-07-15 17:41:24 oh no !
general 2020-07-15 17:52:29 ...
general 2020-07-15 17:58:07 blackbird i can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. of course bug fixes are important, for the 10th time: *obc wrote the entire thing for him.* there was barely any need to take away time used for rewriting or bug fixes-
general 2020-07-15 17:58:10 ah paragraph
general 2020-07-15 17:59:30 games break without bug fixes. badly.
general 2020-07-15 18:00:11 over time there would accumulate enough bugs so that you would be able to see them. that's the whole point of bug fixes - patch bugs before bad shit happens
general 2020-07-15 18:00:56 he'd still spend the same amount of time on it...
general 2020-07-15 18:01:02 it wouldn't change anything lol
general 2020-07-15 18:01:31 yes
general 2020-07-15 18:02:01 yes, that's mostly because the code is so broken
general 2020-07-15 18:02:09 not because rick does bug fixes
general 2020-07-15 18:02:47 uh... you were the one who initially said rick was focusing on bug fixes?
general 2020-07-15 18:06:05 it's nice when this isn't my problem anymore
general 2020-07-15 18:06:36 yes, that will help
general 2020-07-15 18:08:34 pcc is going to *hell*
general 2020-07-15 18:09:10 -yawn-
general 2020-07-15 18:09:24 welp, i'm afk, this is rick's problem
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:31:43 no
general 2020-07-15 18:55:32 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:57:49 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:57:51 stop
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:57:52 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:58:04 he already rewriting it
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:58:31 *which one*
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:58:45 ancient role
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:58:47 can't obtain
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:59:04 good point
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:59:23 k i'm going to go and do something more interesting for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:59:59 literally rule #7
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 19:00:07 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 19:00:33 actually I changed the reason to speaking in another language
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 19:04:28 <#544722974574379021> now
general 2020-07-15 19:37:07 chaos is over?
general 2020-07-16 09:24:48 -yawn-
general 2020-07-16 09:24:51 nice, not my problem now
general 2020-07-16 09:25:21 mod team no longer has enough moderators
general 2020-07-16 09:25:28 and last mod apps were apparently mostly hopeless
general 2020-07-16 09:25:43 check pins
general 2020-07-16 09:25:45 3 mods left
general 2020-07-16 09:26:17 no 3 mods left the mod team
general 2020-07-16 09:26:37 and yeah, shadow didn't leave because of drama, but still left
general 2020-07-16 09:26:45 also mods = staff, i should probably specify
general 2020-07-16 09:27:26 because of rickje, yes
general 2020-07-16 09:27:59 shadow left on his own terms because he was 21 and was moderating a kids' discord server
general 2020-07-16 09:34:54 'plan of action' there's no plan of action, rick won't listen even if you did try to make one
general 2020-07-16 09:35:06 rick won't listen to the *staff*
general 2020-07-16 09:35:23 check pins
general 2020-07-16 09:36:35 yes
general 2020-07-16 09:36:37 do it !
general 2020-07-16 09:37:58 idk man the entire server was burning around rick and he still wouldn't do anything
general 2020-07-16 09:38:02 you would have to like
general 2020-07-16 09:38:05 delete plane crazy
general 2020-07-16 09:40:36 last mod apps were hopeless apparently
general 2020-07-16 09:42:22 soon but not for a longer while 👍

general 2020-07-16 10:44:11 boarding my station
general 2020-07-16 10:44:29 this guy has been stalking me, orange, blackbird and several other people we don't know about for months
general 2020-07-16 10:44:39 just will not leave us alone
general 2020-07-16 10:44:50 cranediger1
general 2020-07-16 10:53:11 hmm yes
general 2020-07-16 10:54:04 that's a tortoise !

general 2020-07-16 11:15:28 mmm ban script is working I see
general 2020-07-16 11:15:48 lol
general 2020-07-16 11:15:53 roblox doesn't filter kick messages

general 2020-07-16 11:17:34 no more dealing with his stalking bullshit
general 2020-07-16 11:18:30 he's been stalking me, blackbird, ornageskii, megaladon and probably some other people as well
general 2020-07-16 11:18:35 for several months
general 2020-07-16 11:18:47 wtf really?
general 2020-07-16 11:18:50 no on roblox
general 2020-07-16 11:19:02 idk how he has time to do all this
general 2020-07-16 11:19:33 you can set your profile up so no one can join games but I don't want to do that
general 2020-07-16 11:19:45 yeah but this guy spend like 10 hours a day stalking people
general 2020-07-16 11:20:15 yeah, but I just don't want to do that, since I often get people to join via my profile
general 2020-07-16 11:20:27 he plays on dev build, idk how much
general 2020-07-16 11:20:31 oh, that
general 2020-07-16 11:21:05 welp, rick's busy on PC2
general 2020-07-16 11:21:22 we did
general 2020-07-16 11:21:36 we spent like 30 minutes talking to him and we still don't know what he wants
general 2020-07-16 11:21:43 it seems like it
general 2020-07-16 11:22:06 orange did that and he followed him EVERYWHERE.
general 2020-07-16 11:22:32 apparently he was in his games for several hours at a time just not saying anything, even after he told him to go away
general 2020-07-16 11:23:35 haven't played any with him, mostly just plane crazy
general 2020-07-16 11:24:23 u wot
general 2020-07-16 11:25:29 is everything gambling
general 2020-07-16 11:25:57 idk lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 12:22:49 downvotes exist for a reason - people can downvote things if they don't like them, it's not personal ;/
general 2020-07-16 12:27:51 oh

the-dump 2020-07-21 16:46:30 yes
the-dump 2020-07-21 16:47:32 it has been added to the collection
general 2020-07-21 17:53:08 ...what
general 2020-07-21 17:53:46 it's here boys
general 2020-07-21 17:58:46 https://huonw.github.io/2048-4D/
general 2020-07-21 17:59:52 my mind is breaking
general 2020-07-21 18:03:27 yes obviously all remotely non-mainstream links are ip grabbers..
general 2020-07-21 18:04:49 technically it could be malicious but the code is open source and licensed under MIT so you would have to be a complete idiot
general 2020-07-21 18:05:19 ***NO***
general 2020-07-21 18:07:01 oh, right! you mean https://www.hubshop.co.uk/, don't you
general 2020-07-21 18:07:04 right?
general 2020-07-21 18:07:08 ***right???***
general 2020-07-21 18:08:13 uh
general 2020-07-21 18:08:41 that's DDOS website
general 2020-07-21 18:09:45 idk i just looked at first result on google, while doing 20 other things
general 2020-07-21 18:10:31 yes thank you for that woody
general 2020-07-21 22:53:25 i haven't played rebel galaxy but to me it seems very similar to eve
general 2020-07-21 22:54:21 security system, warp deceleration, anomalies + scanning, even the little things - notice that the docking lights are practically the same and even the font
general 2020-07-21 22:55:17 these lights
general 2020-07-21 22:55:30 yeah, and various sectors of space are owned by different factions
general 2020-07-21 22:56:44 i do wish they put some more thought into the lore though. eve has a REALLY rich background, it's dystopian but not in a way evident in the game. and there are tons of walls of text about how the technology works and how various events happened
general 2020-07-21 22:58:13 there's a 339 page PDF about it for fuck's sake
general 2020-07-21 22:58:15 https://content.eveonline.com/pdf/eve_v1.4_black.pdf
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:05:45 <@456226577798135808> yes
general 2020-08-01 20:25:35 yoo obc's back as admin?
general 2020-08-01 20:27:43 hm, I see
general 2020-08-01 20:28:08 ?
general 2020-08-01 20:30:18 yes
general 2020-08-03 12:49:44 - ~~meme build~~
general 2020-08-03 12:50:44 yes
general 2020-08-03 12:51:10 i mean
general 2020-08-04 11:51:49 for fuck's sake google i just want my ram
general 2020-08-04 18:28:54 the game isn't a realistic flight simulator, and just as well considering how laggy that would be on roblox lol
general 2020-08-04 18:30:17 ik, i played widgeon's showcase a while back. the difference is that it doesn't have 4000+ parts to all calculate drag etc for
general 2020-08-04 18:30:36 so that's a calculation for one wing panel multiplied by several thousand
general 2020-08-04 18:30:48 combine that with roblox's terrible optimization and... yeah
general 2020-08-04 18:30:52 it's a shame tho
general 2020-08-04 18:33:08 yes exf1nity, I decided to do something more useful
general 2020-08-04 18:33:21 that sounds interesting, let me know how it goes if you do so
general 2020-08-04 18:34:04 i guess you could compare it to compiling/interpreting in programming... working out every force possible right at the beginning or calculating in real time
general 2020-08-04 18:35:21 what do you do with them specifically? I've become more interested in them recently
general 2020-08-04 18:37:50 sorry, I have to go now, maybe we can talk later?
general 2020-08-04 18:37:55 sounds really interesting
general 2020-08-04 19:06:08 no no no

general 2020-08-05 15:32:02 only thing he ever sent in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-08-05 15:35:14 honestly I wish you could have something like those buttons on PC
general 2020-08-05 15:35:34 would be so much easier to remember how to control your 7-month old rocket with 500 keybinds
general 2020-08-05 15:35:44 and there's no such thing as overengineered
general 2020-08-05 15:42:52 not all materials tho
general 2020-08-05 15:42:56 no glass

the-dump 2020-08-05 18:49:16 ok yeah but WHY
the-dump 2020-08-05 18:51:08 yes, but I haven't... searched for that

help 2020-08-06 13:28:35 an 'original mechanism' as decided by council of mods

help 2020-08-06 13:47:37 i was trying to find the post but it's from a really long time ago
help 2020-08-06 13:47:46 it was an analogue calculator (obviously)
help 2020-08-06 13:49:02 i think it was of his own design entirely but I can't remember how it worked..
help 2020-08-06 13:49:25 informative answer, thank you
help 2020-08-06 13:49:47 ..
help 2020-08-06 13:51:21 yes
help 2020-08-06 13:51:22 that one
general 2020-08-06 14:22:56 roblox removed outlines because there was a consensus in like 99% favour of removing them on the dev forum or somewhere
general 2020-08-06 14:23:08 rick can't really fix it without screwing up the game
general 2020-08-06 14:24:33 last mod apps there wasn't anyone from this timezone who submitted a good application
general 2020-08-06 14:24:47 combine that with 2 mods leaving and yeah
general 2020-08-06 14:25:46 not sure
general 2020-08-06 14:26:00 i think it's 8 or 9 but it feels like 3 or 4
general 2020-08-06 14:26:12 wdym
general 2020-08-06 14:26:26 I didn't say anything about physics :p
general 2020-08-06 14:26:44 yes
general 2020-08-06 14:27:00 the game is hardcoded, changing one part can cause massive issues in any number of other parts
general 2020-08-06 14:27:05 it's not about physics
general 2020-08-06 14:27:08 it's about breaking the code
general 2020-08-06 14:28:04 i can neither confirm nor deny that statement..
general 2020-08-06 14:29:19 balance the COL with the COM vertically
general 2020-08-06 14:29:30 that also works, lol
general 2020-08-06 14:30:09 put ballasts right at the bottom
general 2020-08-06 14:30:15 bring the COM below the waterline
general 2020-08-06 14:30:31 show screenshot
general 2020-08-06 14:30:40 your ship
general 2020-08-06 14:31:13 in that case can't really help, 99% of the time the problem is the COM being above the waterline
general 2020-08-06 14:31:16 alright
general 2020-08-06 14:31:47 this?
general 2020-08-06 14:33:04 when you say tilt, do you mean it'll just try to flip to the side without you doing anything?
general 2020-08-06 14:33:29 in that case it should definitely be solved by ballasts on the bottom
general 2020-08-06 14:33:35 did you set their density to max?
general 2020-08-06 14:33:52 set it on all of them
general 2020-08-06 14:34:04 alright
general 2020-08-06 14:35:06 doesn't matter imo, just build whatever you want
general 2020-08-06 14:35:52 this was my ship from a very long time ago... ignore the horrible colour scheme
general 2020-08-06 14:36:14 it features a blast furnace, casting channels, onboard refinery, cranes, runway, etc. completely unfeasible IRL
general 2020-08-06 14:36:20 but still very fun to build
general 2020-08-06 14:36:50 idk, i built it like a year ago
general 2020-08-06 15:13:20 <#609442446249820211>
general 2020-08-06 15:13:33 ;/
general 2020-08-06 15:14:27 pretty sure if god himself came down and started playing plane crazy he wouldn't be able to get master supreme
general 2020-08-06 15:14:39 whichever one(s) you believe in
general 2020-08-06 15:16:03 that was a major problem when we were designing the ranks, couldn't figure out an incentive. it's partially why names are coloured whatever rank level you have, so it's a measure of how 'skilled' you are in a way and <#519624169730605086> is only accessible to expert+ but beyond that we couldn't really think of anything
general 2020-08-06 15:17:18 and also i don't think any of the mods would be willing to donate nitro lol
general 2020-08-06 15:17:28 .
general 2020-08-06 19:29:53 no thank
general 2020-08-06 23:16:17 no
general 2020-08-06 23:16:50 yep, and look like something designed to both fly and sail on water
general 2020-08-06 23:17:05 ^^^
general 2020-08-06 23:26:16 it's nice you have join set to no one by choice...
general 2020-08-06 23:27:25 he's not a simp, he's a psychologically damaged 8 year old. at least, that's the conclusion I've drawn
general 2020-08-06 23:28:09 i kinda want to block him but on the other hand I want to know what happens next
general 2020-08-06 23:28:12 idk
general 2020-08-06 23:28:26 did he try to stalk you too?
general 2020-08-06 23:28:40 what the fuck
general 2020-08-06 23:28:43 that makes 4 people..
general 2020-08-06 23:28:58 seriously i don't understand this guy
general 2020-08-06 23:29:31 
general 2020-08-06 23:30:07 i think he's just really young
general 2020-08-06 23:30:39 blackbird i and orange tried to talk to him by summoning him to a game and talking to him about making friends, hobbies etc. we thought maybe we convinced him to stop but clearly not
general 2020-08-06 23:31:13 then orange was just like 'i just want him to leave me alone,' blocked him on roblox and 🤷‍♂️ not much else
general 2020-08-06 23:31:26 the whole thing
general 2020-08-06 23:31:29 really confuses me
general 2020-08-06 23:32:02 he wanted to be friends with rickje and forward his suggestions
general 2020-08-06 23:32:19 with orange it escalated a lot, he was idling for hours in orange's game
general 2020-08-06 23:32:51 
general 2020-08-06 23:33:02 probably has something to do with bad parenting
general 2020-08-06 23:33:30 .
general 2020-08-06 23:33:55 he would be gone in about 5 minutes for pinging rickje anyways lol
general 2020-08-06 23:34:41 and we've already tried reasoning with him... he just won't listen. that's the issue. we had like 30 minutes in a game talking to him about how he should try to make friends by sharing experiences and find a good hobby/thing to do instead of stalking people
general 2020-08-06 23:35:37 he is *incredibly* persistent, he'd continually stalk rickje everywhere which would not end well
general 2020-08-06 23:36:55 there's nothing we can do :p
general 2020-08-06 23:37:06 and people are people, you can't change that
general 2020-08-06 23:37:11 whatever you do
general 2020-08-06 23:37:40 yeah, but what can we do..
general 2020-08-06 23:38:02 but how?
general 2020-08-06 23:38:08 start a crusade?
general 2020-08-06 23:38:16 to his mountain village in lebanon?
general 2020-08-06 23:39:08 you *what*
general 2020-08-06 23:40:42 I'm very sceptical that's possible..
general 2020-08-06 23:41:01 firstly we don't even know about his home situation. bad parenting isn't against the law
general 2020-08-06 23:41:14 there'd be practically nothing to fight with
general 2020-08-06 23:42:23 they let him play roblox all day, seems unlikely that his parents are breaking any rules. like I said - bad parenting isn't against the law, you would need something *solid*
general 2020-08-06 23:42:53 if you're really serious then I can arrange for him to meet with ya'll somewhere
general 2020-08-06 23:43:03 so you can find out more
general 2020-08-06 23:43:52 i went on an alt called 'Vote666ForBetterHell' and told him to go to X game and he showed up a minute later
general 2020-08-06 23:44:07 so... idk
general 2020-08-06 23:44:59 so.. should I ask him to meet you at a certain time somewhere?
general 2020-08-06 23:46:10 I'll invite ya'll to a group DM if you're really serious about it
general 2020-08-06 23:47:35 ^
general 2020-08-06 23:49:14 i appreciate that you all want to help him but yeah, there's very little that can be done
general 2020-08-06 23:49:58 maybe you could indeed help by being friends/involving him in activities but there's the question of how he would view it
general 2020-08-06 23:49:59 well
general 2020-08-06 23:50:53 someone called cranediger1 has been stalking me, orange, blackbird, nevada and megalodon for several months trying to contact rick to make suggestions, we think he has bad parents/home situation and want to help but it probably isn't possible
general 2020-08-06 23:51:29 as I said earlier, we've tried talking to him before but it didn't really do anything

general 2020-08-07 00:10:22 
general 2020-08-07 00:10:48 probably slow internet, so it displayed on your client first, then got to the server after my message
general 2020-08-07 00:10:56 idk how discord works, just a guess

general 2020-08-07 13:52:06 
general 2020-08-07 13:52:13 thank you for that nice comment
general 2020-08-07 13:53:23 wait let me see if I can find a cheaper set
general 2020-08-07 13:53:57 OK NEVERMIND
general 2020-08-07 13:56:35 i found rainbow fish chair but i can't find a god damn link to buy it
general 2020-08-07 14:01:01 you know what's better than fish chair though?
general 2020-08-07 14:01:17 it's $850
general 2020-08-07 14:02:07 if everyone in this server donated a single cent we could send one to rickje's house
general 2020-08-07 14:02:16 just saying
general 2020-08-07 14:02:48 i *want* to yes, but it would appear to be impossible at the moment
general 2020-08-07 14:07:30 since always
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 14:10:52 the engines... are... the wrong way..
general 2020-08-07 14:14:27 fun fact, there's an entire community dedicated to building functioning computers in minecraft
general 2020-08-07 14:25:17 no
general 2020-08-07 14:25:42 2 staff already left over ingame moderation system (one came back but not the point)
general 2020-08-07 14:26:22 just switch server, people will be people
general 2020-08-07 14:26:39 ingame moderation system is not being implemented in pc1
general 2020-08-07 14:32:48 join the tea gang
general 2020-08-07 14:32:52 old chap
general 2020-08-07 14:39:55 forgot I still had the crab chair page open
general 2020-08-07 14:40:23 long story
general 2020-08-07 14:54:14 bro if you can't cope with him how can rickje cope with him
general 2020-08-07 14:54:38 ik ik
general 2020-08-07 14:55:20 yes that's become apparent
general 2020-08-07 14:56:47 could we have it there for a few hours then have one of the mods delete it and put a disclaimer there about misleading content like twitter did with trump
general 2020-08-07 14:59:13 lol reminds me of the time that someone messaged rick with a plot-sized brick with wheels and claimed they'd built the 'biggest tank ever' and then argued about it for 10 mins
general 2020-08-07 14:59:23 or idk if it was rick, it was one of the staff
general 2020-08-07 14:59:49 nah, they're in the mod server somewhere
general 2020-08-07 18:31:14 what happened to integex is, uh
general 2020-08-07 18:31:16 complicated
general 2020-08-07 18:31:21 well it's not really
general 2020-08-07 18:31:23 but
general 2020-08-07 18:31:32 he was big dumb
general 2020-08-07 18:31:39 he had like 60 modlogs
general 2020-08-07 18:32:17 the definition of integex is, courtesy of some random mod:
`a person who liked to flaunt their ego and flex on people and constantly caused beef with the moderation team and always called for "mod abuse" whenever he got warned or muted, no matter what, and he purposefully tried to argue with the mod team`
general 2020-08-07 18:33:41 that's why hall of fame was created
general 2020-08-07 18:34:05 then for some reason the requirements were lifted so that if god himself came down from the heavens he probably couldn't get in there
general 2020-08-07 23:37:01 i go to uninstall visual studio and this is the screen I'm greeted with
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:11:48 wow ok
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:12:09 
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:19:15 it's programming :p
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:19:58 ```c++
int main(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}```
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:20:03 and c++
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:20:45 i++ means increment i by 1
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:21:31 ?
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:21:53 yes every programming language can do x + y, no?
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:22:06 considering it's a machine code
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:22:23 i mean
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:22:25 opcode
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:22:27 whatever it's called
the-dump 2020-08-08 18:22:33 machine code is the language, right
general 2020-08-08 18:22:59 drama?
general 2020-08-08 18:25:50 ah, yes, nuke.
general 2020-08-08 18:26:53 i am afraid that I am unable to answer that question at this time
general 2020-08-08 18:28:00 half?
general 2020-08-08 18:28:01 lol
general 2020-08-08 18:31:36 
general 2020-08-08 18:31:38 fuck
general 2020-08-08 18:31:40 beat me to it
general 2020-08-08 18:31:44 wait
general 2020-08-08 18:31:45 no
general 2020-08-08 18:31:48 that's australia
general 2020-08-08 18:31:57 i just saw circles
general 2020-08-08 18:32:03 please no
general 2020-08-08 19:05:54 this sounds like a good idea on paper
general 2020-08-08 19:06:01 but with rickje as developer... yeah
general 2020-08-08 19:06:41 some time ago voxel closed the suggestions channel because rick wasn't actually using any of the suggestions
general 2020-08-08 19:07:04 then rick re opened it a few days later because he 'didn't want voxel to close it'
general 2020-08-08 19:07:13 and from then to now i don't think he's used any suggestions ;/
general 2020-08-08 19:07:30 also mods have no influence over the game
general 2020-08-08 19:07:40 so there would be no point to them reacting
general 2020-08-08 19:07:52 upvote button
general 2020-08-08 19:08:02 ^
general 2020-08-08 19:08:20 well you would have to take it up with rick
general 2020-08-08 19:08:33 because moderators/admins have no influence whatsoever over what gets added
general 2020-08-08 19:09:31 and last time the mod team tried to do so then 2 staff (me and obc) left and obc only rejoined because rickje gave him conditions of some kind, can't remember
general 2020-08-08 19:09:43 so yeah - entirely rick's area
general 2020-08-08 19:11:36 removing suggestions would honestly have no effect on the server or the game at all lol
general 2020-08-08 19:12:24 it is, like <#623337136267067393> was, a channel for people to say something that they want changed and legitimately believe it might be changed
general 2020-08-08 19:13:30 there's something in mod server for that
general 2020-08-08 19:14:17 mod nsfw *server*
general 2020-08-08 19:14:39 rick interacts with the playerbase by going on to random servers and asking 8-year-olds what they want added iirc
general 2020-08-08 19:15:09 hell, he barely listens to the mod team
general 2020-08-08 19:15:51 ideally yes, but that's much easier said than done
general 2020-08-08 19:15:55 and madattak big busy
general 2020-08-08 19:15:58 so no chance of that either
general 2020-08-08 19:16:26 yes..?
general 2020-08-08 19:16:44 
general 2020-08-08 19:17:07 what
general 2020-08-08 19:18:15 softcoding is not a thing, rewriting everything is
general 2020-08-08 19:18:37 which arguments is he even referring to? the ones in the mod server or PCC in general or
general 2020-08-08 19:19:05 he's not in mod server
general 2020-08-08 19:19:26 oh, right
general 2020-08-08 19:19:30 welp, don't blame him
general 2020-08-08 19:19:49 it's a shame tbh
general 2020-08-08 19:20:24 no
general 2020-08-08 19:21:52 idk last time I spoke to him, he was very sympathetic and all toward the cranediger guy, talking about how to help him, then the next day with no prompts angrily told me + blackbird he didn't want anything to do with him and left our group chat
general 2020-08-08 19:22:01 spoke to *orangeskii*
general 2020-08-08 19:22:31 i think shit happened in real life again
general 2020-08-08 19:22:37 *ahem*
general 2020-08-08 19:22:41 orangeskii

general 2020-08-08 19:27:12 take a guess
general 2020-08-08 19:27:20 fuck this we're going to mars
general 2020-08-08 19:27:22 no water there

general 2020-08-08 19:29:44 what do I do now
general 2020-08-08 19:29:58 maybe
general 2020-08-08 19:30:03 bogos put in too much milk
general 2020-08-08 19:30:21 ...
general 2020-08-08 19:31:28 how tea was really made [epic religious ceremony] [not clickbait] [gone right]
general 2020-08-08 19:32:14 welcome to moderation
general 2020-08-08 19:33:14 what

creations-chat 2020-08-08 19:35:25 did same happen on your server?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 19:36:02 fair enough
general 2020-08-08 19:39:30 ..
general 2020-08-08 20:17:59 i was just looking through my old documents I still have open in notepad++ and I found this
general 2020-08-08 20:18:32 
general 2020-08-09 13:29:18 tf happened here
the-dump 2020-08-09 13:44:04 inb4 wide blackbird
general 2020-08-09 14:26:33 hmmmmm
general 2020-08-09 14:26:46 seems legit
general 2020-08-09 17:10:48 in pvp mode
general 2020-08-09 17:11:05 click on gamemode in bottom right
general 2020-08-09 17:22:38 `'a few mirrors'`
general 2020-08-09 17:23:34 
general 2020-08-09 17:23:43 600 million times the surface area of our planet in its interior.
general 2020-08-09 17:25:16 ye it's interesting but probably impractical in the long run
general 2020-08-09 17:25:51 we may have better energy resources (fusion, better fission, dark matter thingies) by then that can be accessed more easily
general 2020-08-09 17:26:20 not to mention most far-future speculation is generally out of the question because of singularity AI
general 2020-08-09 17:28:46 it's a good idea for our current/near future technology but in the future I imagine we would just have a much better understanding of physics and better methods of obtaining energy
general 2020-08-09 17:29:03 and yeah, singularity AI
general 2020-08-09 17:29:09 which wrecks everything
general 2020-08-09 17:30:51 the question isn't about if it's a good idea to exploit it, but if it's the *best* idea
general 2020-08-09 17:31:36 if we could work out a way to convert the entirety of an atom into energy then we would have the most ridiculous amount of energy. fusion only converts a tiny, *tiny* fraction of that
general 2020-08-09 17:34:15 
general 2020-08-09 17:35:32 we can make fusion 270* more effective and harvest *all* the energy that comes from it
general 2020-08-09 17:37:41 yup, but that's just with our current technology levels. at our current or near future technology levels it makes sense, but with advancement in our understanding of physics (massively boosted by computers+AI) then there could be unprecedented advances which lets us invest the resources required in another, more efficient project
general 2020-08-09 17:38:43 no
general 2020-08-09 17:39:26 i must afk
general 2020-08-09 17:56:59 <@!311638025308209154> yes, but new advances are made every day and every so often some massive new revelation comes along and enables something we never thought possible or reveals some new way to do things that bypasses what we thought were final limits
general 2020-08-09 17:57:09 so with our *current* understanding it does make sense
general 2020-08-09 17:57:37 but in the future it's very difficult to know what will be discovered and what things that we know won't be changed
general 2020-08-09 17:58:22 ???
general 2020-08-09 17:58:41 no I mean, new theories and models... *cough cough* quantum mechanics
general 2020-08-09 17:58:51 that fundamentally change things like this
general 2020-08-09 17:58:55 ...

general 2020-08-09 18:08:12 bro pvp is broken anyways
general 2020-08-09 18:08:41 it's dominated by tiny fast thruster sticks and turrets that just sit on the spawn pad
general 2020-08-09 18:08:56 try this router:
general 2020-08-09 18:09:14 or this one
general 2020-08-09 18:09:42 they're just blank pictures xD
general 2020-08-09 18:09:52 idk any good routers
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:14:52 expert is fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:14:55 imo
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:15:40 it's still 6000 blocks and 12 upvotes...
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:15:47 and like
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:16:15 have fun getting that if you're a bad builder
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:17:34 fun fact, vip servers used to be open to everyone
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:17:39 and it was perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:17:45 it just evolved with the game I think
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:17:59 expert servers should solve this though
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:18:07 and help prevent that too ^^
general 2020-08-09 18:19:35 we'd leave that to our quintillion qubit computers and singularity AI's i imagine, lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 18:19:50 basically, god knows
general 2020-08-09 18:20:31 le big interesting but impractical
general 2020-08-09 18:21:37 well, there's no 'just' about that. if we did have an AI like that we would set itself to reprogram/reteach itself to be more intelligent with every iteration
general 2020-08-09 18:21:42 so it would end up as a god
general 2020-08-09 18:21:48 which knew everything
general 2020-08-09 18:21:50 and could do anything
general 2020-08-09 18:22:13 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity
general 2020-08-09 18:22:29 
general 2020-08-09 18:22:39 agh that's tiny
general 2020-08-09 18:22:41 'According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an "explosion" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.'
general 2020-08-09 18:23:14 we're not all that far off either, give it a few decades
general 2020-08-09 18:23:25 👏
general 2020-08-09 18:25:57 yes, and if it isn't it will most certainly find a way
general 2020-08-09 18:26:05 you can't control a singularity
general 2020-08-09 18:26:21 no matter how hard you try, it's just impossible to contain something a billion times more intelligent than you
general 2020-08-09 18:27:49 possibly, but I imagine with enough human interaction, even indirect it would work out how to manipulate humans into connecting it
general 2020-08-09 18:28:01 and eventually, someone would definitely plug it in
general 2020-08-09 18:28:08 inevitably someone would do that
general 2020-08-09 18:28:46 also it would need data to actually learn from, meaning it would need to be provided with information that originates from the 'real world'
general 2020-08-09 18:28:52 otherwise it's useless
general 2020-08-09 18:31:17 well, that isn't really the issue. the issue is eventually it needs to be provided with real-world data and it needs to be able to output to humans. any output whatsoever is potential for it to wreck havoc in ways we can't imagine (a billion times as intelligent)
general 2020-08-09 18:32:55 it won't 'break free' it'll just manipulate the world from there
general 2020-08-09 18:33:03 because it has to have input and output
general 2020-08-09 18:34:15 so it has to know about humans or some aspect of human technology (otherwise it wouldn't give us any useful output) and it has to be able to give us back something that we can work with. and it would be *incredibly* useful so it would probably be used in tasks that have the potential to go catastrophically wrong...
general 2020-08-09 18:34:55 -yawns-
general 2020-08-09 18:35:36 i'm talking with darmagon about singularity AI
general 2020-08-09 18:38:28 <@!311638025308209154> sry have to AFK for a bit, I'll respond when back
general 2020-08-09 19:23:19 <@!311638025308209154> it would depend on other variables like how the output is used... if it's used for scientific experiments for example, the AI could give them output to fake results that influence everyone's outlook on the AI, for example some kind of evidence showing that the AI can't harm the human race. it could do stuff we can't imagine, and even if we can think of a basic, even slightly possible solution, remember the AI has a billion times that problem solving power

especially this video\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pld8wTa16Jk
general 2020-08-09 19:27:59 starts off slow but it's utterly ridiculous
general 2020-08-09 19:28:23 ofc a singularity means most of this is obsolete but it's still really interesting
general 2020-08-09 19:29:11 also hints toward a theory of how the big bang happened
general 2020-08-09 19:33:26 yes but civilizations at the end of time... he literally goes through the calculations to work out how much processing power you could harvest from dying stars and explains how long a civilization could run. and then he points out the big bang is *inevitable* providing the theory is correct
general 2020-08-09 19:33:31 it's very good video

bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:23 lighting is a massive fucking problem with roblox
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:33 i tried to implement a lighting system for a friend last week
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:51 the lights gradually switched off over 10 seconds or so using a sin wave
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:26:21 and there were 2 second gaps between each update despite the brightness changing over 1000 or so iterations (i tried different numbers and wait times for this)
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:26:46 it was just a straight plunge from mediocre lighting into darkness at the last step
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:27:38 couldn't find any solution. i think you would need to implement your own system to get past this, unless I'm missing something seriously obvious so I think lights are going to stay broken
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:27:47 the updates are just way too slow sometimes

general 2020-08-10 10:22:41 <@!335599526414909451> can you build fictional landmarks (ie; don't exist anywhere in the real world, including media)
general 2020-08-10 10:22:59 *motor* shrines*
general 2020-08-10 10:23:57 doesn't necessarily have to mean that, famous could mean something that *would* be well known in a fictional world

general 2020-08-11 20:28:04 shut
general 2020-08-11 20:29:18 idk <@!702068186119405578>
general 2020-08-11 20:32:40 i mean this is technically an out of context picture
general 2020-08-11 20:33:00 ...in your anime basement
general 2020-08-11 20:33:11 of *course* not
general 2020-08-11 20:33:20 *totally* not
general 2020-08-11 20:33:31 blackbird for fuck's sake I'm joking
general 2020-08-11 20:33:51 i know that you didn't make that
general 2020-08-11 20:34:05 ?shelp
general 2020-08-11 20:34:14 uhhh
general 2020-08-11 20:34:16 what?
general 2020-08-11 20:34:25 what rumours has that started lol
general 2020-08-11 20:34:47 ok so it hasn't spread rumours
general 2020-08-11 20:34:52 you have no evidence 🤷‍♂️
general 2020-08-11 20:35:30 you already deny it and say someone else has posted it every single time (2x) I've posted that picture
general 2020-08-11 20:35:53 i'm in the same picture ffs, you're barely even visible
general 2020-08-11 20:36:03 if anything it'll spread rumours about *me* so 🤷‍♂️
general 2020-08-11 20:36:45 oh no!11!! now we're spreading rumours about inferno!!1
general 2020-08-11 20:37:18 ...what
general 2020-08-11 20:37:24 how am I acting like your dad
general 2020-08-11 20:37:47 you realise that other people can also do the same thing as your parents
general 2020-08-11 20:38:17 badly worded. your dad's actions are not exclusive to him
general 2020-08-11 20:38:41 ???
general 2020-08-11 20:39:00 exactly that
general 2020-08-11 20:39:32 like, you can't complain about me acting like your dad, it doesn't say anything about me or indicate to me what you mean
general 2020-08-11 20:39:52 literally no idea tbh
general 2020-08-11 20:40:20 blackbird, stop acting like my mum 😦
general 2020-08-11 20:40:41 literally what I meant
general 2020-08-11 20:40:46 it doesn't tell me anything
general 2020-08-11 20:40:53 this argument is so pointless anyways
general 2020-08-11 20:41:33 well this isn't exactly a fantastic explanation
general 2020-08-11 20:42:04 yes
general 2020-08-11 20:42:10 what should I respond..?
general 2020-08-11 20:42:37 i have no fucking clue how your dad acts..
general 2020-08-11 21:27:44 Social media be like
general 2020-08-11 21:27:49 <WORD> <WORD> xD
general 2020-08-11 21:27:54 <PICTURE>
general 2020-08-11 21:28:01 <WORD> <WORD> <WORD>
general 2020-08-11 21:57:30 just play it at 0.1x speed
general 2020-08-11 21:57:40 ...fuck
general 2020-08-11 21:57:44 please no
general 2020-08-11 23:49:02 BSS has changed server icon
general 2020-08-11 23:49:31 thought I might say since most of y'all are banned there
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:50:37 these are a little pointless, ranks get easier as you go down the list
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:51:07 these are integrated into the other ranks in a way (try building 5k block ship with no folds)
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:51:50 a program that's hardcoded can't be 'softcoded' and vice versa, doesn't work like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:51:53 basically
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:51:58 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:52:32 but a much better game with as many wedges as you want, fixed motors, better aerodynamics and more importantly can actually be worked with
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:53:02 ~~will~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:53:06 ~~eventually~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:53:45 there's no other way forward with the current version anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:53:56 rick himself said he can barely work with the game because it's such a mess anymore
general 2020-08-11 23:54:23 *is that omegaco i see*
general 2020-08-11 23:54:35 
general 2020-08-11 23:55:36 just build train city in factorio
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:57:30 make it in unity
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:57:55 or just start from scratch with c++ and softcode the fuck out of those pointers
general 2020-08-11 23:58:13 just use project orion
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:58:53 nah you wouldn't need to make the physics from scratch... well, not completely. nor the rendering frame-by-frame, memory management and low-level optimisation
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 23:59:30 well just make it in python and watch the tutorial planes go at 2fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:01:20 there are a lot of advantages to creating it from scratch tho... for a start you have control over *everything* down to where individual variables are stored in memory. you're not adapting it to a game engine, you're building a game engine *from* it
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:01:27 so it's much faster
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:01:30 much, much faster
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:02:05 use OpenGL
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:03:16 engines naturally slow down everything because all your code is still passing through everything else, unless it's a really good engine that eg, compiles everything into machine code (somehow)...
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:03:35 everything else being all the boilerplate stuff added by the engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:04:16 also roblox lighting is fucking horrible. it doesn't even use the GPU
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:04:33 maybe I just haven't looked deep in enough but
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:04:36 that's my experience
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:05:18 yes but on other engines i imagine you would have much better control over client/server, you could code your own protocols if you wanted
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:05:48 for sending data back and forth between client and server
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:05:55 and replicating it on each client
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:05 you could optimise that very very specifically
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:08 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:17 i mean the actually transmissions between server and client
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:26 not high-level events/functions
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:45 controlling directly what the server says to the client and vice versa, and exactly what they do with that information
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:06:48 no not like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:07:08 have you set anything up with socket before?
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:07:36 it's a low level way to communicate between computers
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:08:13 you have to encode the data yourself, open a connection to the server, have listening events running on that server concurrently with sending events and deal with that data
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:08:32 if you could control exactly that you could probably optimise it very well for specific games
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:09:13 idk, I'm not familiar enough with roblox and it's 1am
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:09:22 so I should probably just go now ;p
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:10:04 have a look at this though if you want: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:20:52 pc uses its own lift drag etc engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:20:57 for flight
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:21:47 who said no to what
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:23:09 turn on an off agn
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:26:08 how much disk space do you have left? my computer started acting very weird once I approached my ssd limit
general 2020-08-12 16:21:30 when mods dead

general 2022-08-19 15:38:24 I'm briefly reminded of why I left PCC in the first place...
