general 2021-02-23 02:18:06 It was called the KMS Bismarck
general 2021-02-23 02:18:22 He was an engine room mechanic on it

general 2021-02-23 02:23:21 So my german side of the family were stationed on the KMS Bismarck and the British side of my family served in the RAF patroling the Dover coastline in Spitfires.
general 2021-02-23 02:23:48 Come from a family of war <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

general 2021-02-23 02:29:14 And mine was a WW2 German who served under the rule of the angry mustache man that failed art school. What a wonderful world

general 2021-02-23 15:03:12 Some also say it looks like someone called Black Hat
general 2021-02-23 15:04:04 But it's just the sharp teeth and facial structure that is seen in a lot of animated characters
