plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:55:31 Is it possible to motorlock 2 blocks that are 1x1?
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:56:49 Is there any common mistakes I could be making then? I'm struggling to achieve it
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:57:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:58:39 I believe my placement is possibly preventing it from locking together entirely, but I'm not sure how I would go around fixing that
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 00:59:28 ðŸ’€ okay
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 04:21:21 is it possible for me to let someone else edit my build with me?
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 04:22:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 04:22:36 welp
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 04:22:39 okay then lol
