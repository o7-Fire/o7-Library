help 2021-08-25 08:37:45 of the current conversations
help 2021-08-25 08:38:08 and not say something that is as obvious as the fact that you build in this game with blocks
help 2021-08-25 08:39:48 yes.
help 2021-08-25 08:43:51 ok ill consider
help 2021-08-25 08:44:01 i used cameras to get the block where i want
help 2021-08-25 08:44:30 only problem is half motor sticking out fo the floor
help 2021-08-25 08:46:20 
help 2021-08-25 08:46:37 now i just was doing a test stacking them on eachother basic stuff
help 2021-08-25 08:46:53 but idk if i will be able to hde it at all
help 2021-08-25 08:47:18 
help 2021-08-25 08:47:19 advantage x flight 29
help 2021-08-25 08:47:41 ive only ever made 1 semi serious build and that was my mini jet
help 2021-08-25 08:48:10 hmm
help 2021-08-25 08:48:13 i guess you are right
help 2021-08-25 08:48:43 it still sticks up some tho
help 2021-08-25 08:49:15 i wouldnt care if it sticks up but theres that little nub on the end aswell
help 2021-08-25 09:40:19 anything else i can add to this overkill minijet
help 2021-08-25 09:40:31 it can go 2000
help 2021-08-25 09:40:38 forward or backwards too
help 2021-08-25 09:41:31 it also can kinda somewhat hover too
help 2021-08-25 09:43:56 idk
help 2021-08-25 10:02:33 how do you make planes handle high speeds
help 2021-08-25 10:03:00 without doing crazy up and down action
help 2021-08-25 18:30:10 
help 2021-08-25 18:30:16 ive found this plane i made ages ago
help 2021-08-25 18:30:24 but i cant get it to pull up
help 2021-08-25 18:31:14 thats the issue i had before i gave up and i even have a version with a servo to try and lift and it just wont
help 2021-08-25 18:31:55 it pulls up so deathly slow
help 2021-08-25 18:45:20 anyone know of a decently simple big plane
help 2021-08-25 18:46:42 wh
help 2021-08-25 18:46:57 i feel bad for laughing
help 2021-08-25 18:49:39 why isnt there a actual half triangle wedge
help 2021-08-25 18:49:41 rip
help 2021-08-25 18:54:15 erm
help 2021-08-25 18:54:29 no cap i dunno how im gonna do the bs29 front bit
help 2021-08-25 18:55:08 b29
help 2021-08-25 18:55:10 sorry
help 2021-08-25 18:55:12 i dont know why
help 2021-08-25 18:55:32 but literally everytime i try to type out b29 it comes out as bs29 lol
help 2021-08-25 18:56:41 well i wanted to use half wedges but there isnt a proper half triangle wedge or i would do the front bit that way
help 2021-08-25 18:58:08 i guess so
help 2021-08-25 18:58:58 erm
help 2021-08-25 18:59:09 guess the way i was gonna do it was the right direction i guess
help 2021-08-25 19:04:19 do that
help 2021-08-25 19:04:48 my first non tutorial plane and 3rd plane was a mini jet
help 2021-08-25 19:22:38 sorry for all the questions but how does one make a good afterburner particle effect
help 2021-08-25 19:25:07 well my non overkill mini jet only flys around 100-200
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:46:57 whats psm lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:47:28 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:51:09 oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:51:12 i was gonna say
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:51:22 _. -._
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 04:52:00 i like that how the trails enable you you put a key down
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:10:58 enemies:exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:11:36 if that existed i dont think my little jet would survive even 2 seconds of holding W
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:14:01 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:14:16 kinda hard to design planes with such limited tools like we currently have
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:14:35 and plus wouldnt it be easier to just get storm works or simple planes or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:15:40 im talking about structurally
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:15:55 i mean look at the wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:16:16 imagine if wing tool like simple planes wing too
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:16:21 *tool
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:16:30 wh
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:17:12 am bored
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:17:20 someone suggest easy plane to make

plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:19:10 my problem is trying to make anything is proportioning things
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:19:31 if i make it too small some things i cant make properly too big and its a bit meh
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:19:54 
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 05:20:04 i am being challenged

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:13:52 it spawned dropped a ton of parts and took off at mach 5
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:14:29 im impressed with the build if we disregard that part of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:16:02 dropped some sort of glitched pistons
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:17:54 why is this game so difficult
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:18:44 i just wanna motor lock this but its gonna clip through
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 08:19:39 wh that blimp just bounced off of nothing mid air
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:15:49 am bad at building
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:15:53 how to get bette
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:15:57 better

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:16:44 bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:17:11 2 are micro planes and the other is just a weird bi plane pvp thing that can fly without a wing
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:21:55 imagine being able to run blender
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:22:05 weak

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:23:04 wh
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:23:29 what plane shold i try to built
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:27:24 yeah nevermind making a f15
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:27:34 literally impossible to build on low graphics
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:33:13 tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:33:16 my cpu comes
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 05:33:26 then i will be on my new setup

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 06:54:31 what could i add to make the steering on my submarine better
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 06:54:43 i dont want to make it look any worse
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 06:55:09 ill do rockets cuz the i alr got rudder
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:02:24 i hate submarines
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:02:29 im tryna make one
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:02:38 it floats level but when you dive it kinda just
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:02:39 noses down
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:03:13 its all centered tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 07:03:20 on the yellow thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:34:18 i want to build something
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:34:20 but dont
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:34:33 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:35:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:36:23 i got black lsited because i didnt see some announcement about format
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:37:40 first or second?
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:38:23 uh if you mean my first or second time it was the first and only time and happened probably in like 2020
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:40:26 ok this is gona sound crazy but like
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:40:27

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:41:23 and really dont care i mean
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:41:45 my only suggestion was for them to turn down brightness when users have lower graphics
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:41:58 if you are on low graphics its actually blinding
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:42:07 its bannable

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:51:22 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:51:28 i made a mini jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:51:34 but
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:51:39 an egg plane is much smaller
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:51:56 would require lots of motorlock prolly
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:53:33 how do you get fuel
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 08:53:40 its been so long since ive had fuel enabled

help 2022-03-19 19:22:20 well yes obviously but im kinda sped and dont even know how i should go about doing so
help 2022-03-19 19:22:46 do i just angle it and then motorlock it to make it flush against the body

help 2022-03-19 19:45:19 it worked
help 2022-03-19 19:45:32 but the only issue was obviously moving the mouse made it move
help 2022-03-19 19:46:13 so i just have to manually angle the wings with regular motors then
