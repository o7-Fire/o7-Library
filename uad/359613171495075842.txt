bug-reports 2020-03-25 19:39:03 Disconnectors sometimes refuse to disconnect, even after changing the hotkey, replacing the disconnecter, removing and reloading the vehicle, or even rejoining.
help 2020-03-25 19:48:03 Disconnector won't disconnect, i've tried changing the hotkey, replacing the disconnector, removing and re-loading the vehicle the disconnector is attached to, and i've tried rejoining. Nothing is working
help 2020-03-25 19:53:53 putting the disconnector under less stress because of weight doesn't help either
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:01:28 yes
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:02:05 i even tried un-powering it and re-powering it, didn't work either
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:04:16 that gave me an idea, would it be possible to make a flyingmachine like in minecraft using pistons and anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:05:08 you would have to un-anchor and re-anchor the blocks yourself, i don't mean that the pistons will just push the anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:05:32 imma try it
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:05:49 will try that out
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:07:08 didn't work
general 2020-03-25 20:07:31 first one
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:13:08 it works, it's just really slow
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:14:33 no, because the thing i'm disconnecting has 2 different disconnectors, and one of them actually does work, it's just the other one that won't disconnect
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:15:09 it used to work perfectly like a few minutes after i first placed it, it just randomly stopped working
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:17:03 moving the vehicle around on the plot doesn't work either
bug-reports 2020-03-25 20:21:16 this is the setup btw. The disconnector on the left is the one that bugs out and refuses to disconnect no matter what
help 2020-03-25 20:27:19 connected as in the other end of the disconnector is connected to the thing it's trying to disconnect from?
help 2020-03-25 20:27:29 nope
help 2020-03-25 20:28:21 yeah i posted a pic of it in <#498473314445033472>
help 2020-03-25 20:29:26 yeah, i wanted to make a seamless fold, so i had to use disconnectors to remove the motor
help 2020-03-25 20:29:42 but only 1 of the disconnectors are working
help 2020-03-25 20:29:58 and they have the exact same settings
help 2020-03-25 20:30:26 tried with seperate hotkeys too, didn't work
bug-reports 2020-03-25 21:28:35 they are powered, and i am pressing the right key

creations-chat 2020-03-28 21:57:07 Oh ominous floating cube, please share thy wisdom
creations-chat 2020-03-28 21:59:02 indeed it is, it floats too
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:01:41 dude... i literally made it because i was bored... posting something not 100% super original and creative is still allowed
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:02:11 I wasn't.
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:15:16 Medium sized boat. Don't know what specific kind of boat
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:16:17 thanks, noticed the moon was coming up so i took the opportunity
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:17:48 Also: it has a seamless fold, as in the motor for rotating the back part gets disconnected, making it really hard to see where the fold is
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:18:54 Pic of the fold
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:26:05 Except for the curve behind the cockpit looking a bit too steep, looks pretty accurate
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:38:41 Is it supposed to have a propeller? I don't see one in either of the pics
creations-chat 2020-03-28 22:52:57 Pretty sure it doesn't actually fly with it, just uses it to glide
creations-chat 2020-03-28 23:04:35 Oh now i understand why my floating cube could continue to hover higher and higher, because it had blocks underneath the hover engines
creations-chat 2020-03-28 23:23:56 yes

creations-chat 2020-03-29 16:04:30 Doesn't drive well, cuz i wasn't able to make it both look realistic and drive realistically, cuz of the limited size
creations-chat 2020-03-29 16:58:25 I did use motor 2, it just wasn't working very well cuz of the weight i think
creations-chat 2020-03-29 17:45:10 <@!437078588701933568> Mind sending a pic of the ICBM truck? You've caught my interest

creations-chat 2020-05-07 17:26:43 better pic of the front
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:46:02 uh i think these tracks might need some tightening...
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:46:16 just noticed one is literally falling off lol
help 2020-05-13 11:07:14 I've made a large tank with treads, and i tension it using pistons that push the wheels closer to the treads, but the pistons that push the wheels closest to the front forward get compressed again once i start moving, as if they were springs. Is there a way to prevent them from compressing? I've tried locking the pistons but that doesn't work.
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:05:04 Mobile gas station. Has a ramp that can be raised for easier transport.
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:05:21 what y'all think
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:05:27 any suggestions on what to add?
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:08:32 oh i know, i should probably add a gas tank... for atleast a tiny bit more realism
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:18:56 uh
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:18:58 i think so
creations-chat 2020-06-26 16:19:02 idk

creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:18:27 yeah ik, mine hurt while making it
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:21:13 Because it's so compact, it's almost impossible to take a good pic of it tbh
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:23:50 The suspension is 9x4x4 blocks btw

creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:41:13 oh lord that suspension
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:41:44 i mean, it's cool if it works, it just looks like a deathtrap
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:44:27 so what's the suspension for? Train wheels work on the tracks without having to be able to retract/compress/etc
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:46:17 That's strange, i have a 3 block gap and i only derail when going super-fast

creations-chat 2020-06-27 14:09:11 And even worse, they always look so horrible
creations-chat 2020-06-27 14:12:08 I think i've only seen like 1 or 2 siren heads that have actual effort put into them. And on the opposite side of the spectrum, i've seen like 30 siren heads that people put like legit 5 minutes into and then think "Yup, this is worth showing off to everyone"
creations-chat 2020-06-28 18:21:20 bruh it's not even close

creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:33:31 do you have any constructive critisicm, or are you just here to call it bad then not explain why?
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:34:51 I'm not calling it hate speech, it's just not helpful calling it bad but not give an explanation
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:37:14 you gave that explanation while i had already sent my message, i just have bad wifi
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:39:04 by "that bow is just flat" do you mean like the front edge of the ship? I don't really know ship terminology
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:40:00 that doesn't explain it any better...
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:40:25 ah, aight
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:40:35 yeah i see that now lol
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:41:17 3 what?
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:41:59 what part are y'all talking about where 3 is too much, i dont get it
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:43:01 ah,
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:43:21 so if i just like extend the middle block of the 3 it'd be better?
creations-chat 2020-06-30 20:46:05 aight
creations-chat 2020-07-01 11:39:31 There, made the bow "sharper" like y'all said. And no, i won't change the horizontal wedges
creations-chat 2020-07-01 11:39:39 
creations-chat 2020-07-01 11:39:49 It's a tiny bit less chonk at the front now atleast
creations-chat 2020-07-01 11:40:46 977 blocks now
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:47:57 Work In Progress. Some futuristic plane i guess, not really sure what the inspiration is. I guess a bit of a mix between some Marvel planes and random spaceship concept art
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:48:15 only front half done so far
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:49:56 back is basically empty, working my way back slowly
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:39 closer look at the main air intake
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:53:03 they're functional
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:53:32 around 300-500 i think
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:53:35 maybe more
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:54:40 yeah, around 500 blocks so far
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:00:04 my biggest functional plane is a blackbird, which in hindsight doesn't look too bad, even though it was the first real plane i built. Around 500 blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-17 00:05:20 When using helium blocks, does the "Apply at center" option mean the boyant force is applied at the center of mass of the vehicle?

creations-chat 2020-07-17 13:28:01 W.I.P "futuristic plane", 1k parts now, this boi is getting heavy
creations-chat 2020-07-17 13:28:08 
creations-chat 2020-07-17 13:28:20 only like back 1/4 left
creations-chat 2020-07-17 13:29:15 the lowest set of wings fold out, and it's got a hatch at the bottom for dropping stuff
creations-chat 2020-07-23 13:39:06 Damn boi he **T H I C C**
creations-chat 2020-07-23 14:01:48 Added some stuff to my strange boat, like railings and a few small details
creations-chat 2020-07-23 14:02:08 also improved the front of the living quarters
creations-chat 2020-07-23 14:02:15 not as chunky anymore
creations-chat 2020-07-23 14:03:49 although, the living quarters are still filled with water..
creations-chat 2020-07-23 14:20:51 fixed the water problem, but now it looks ridiculous on land
creations-chat 2020-07-23 17:44:45 strange search and rescue speedboat pretty much complete. The radar spins, and the lift-arm for the smaller boat can move up and over the railing. It has a pretty huge interior, but if i furnish it, i'll have to either add helium blocks or even more pontoons to lift it above the water
creations-chat 2020-07-23 17:47:12 1200 blocks

creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:15:39 
creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:16:07 first thing im pretty sure i need to change are the smaller wings in the back (idk the name)

general 2020-08-08 16:29:20 this is what he said... and all i did was build a wall with a toll booth
general 2020-08-08 16:31:42 apparently his method of ruining my life is to blacklist me from his plot <:pain:644301805534183464>

creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:49:44 "Futuristic truck" chassis, before loading.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:49:52 after loading
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:50:25 i got the inspiration from a roblox game
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:51:59 it also has a control center with a chair that can spin
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:52:21 <@!451853936815636511> you mean the gray cylinders?
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:53:01 thanks
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:53:23 those are just the hub caps, the wheels are a bit bigger
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:02:02 Is this a good location for the back wheels? And if anyone's wondering, yes the back and front wheels are the same distance from the centre line of the truck, the front ones just look like they're closer
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:04:06 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:07:54 Steering mechanism highlighted in white
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:08:30 it has horrible steering right now, but im gonna fix that by making the back wheels steer-able too
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:10:12 and yes, that suspension is angled by 0.5 blocks, thanks to locked motors. I didnt really have a choice, since the wheels needed to be raised by 0.5 blocks, but there's not enough room for the suspension to be raised aswell
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:26:15 i managed to fit in a pretty reliable steering mechanism at the back, and it only sticks up 0.5 blocks above the wheels, so there's still plenty room for a trailer
creations-chat 2020-08-20 19:27:00 i also figured out that the steering was worse than expected, because 99% of the weight was at the front, making the back wheels basically float

creations-chat 2020-08-21 22:26:48 want me to post it in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2020-08-21 22:26:56 ait
creations-chat 2020-08-22 17:39:11 Updated my motorcycle. It now leans into turns.
creations-chat 2020-08-22 17:39:16 
creations-chat 2020-08-22 17:41:39 it leans by rotating the cameras up on one side and down on the other, depending on which way it's turning
creations-chat 2020-08-22 17:47:43 how the leaning works - visualized
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:00:44 so what do y'all think? Took around an hour and a half.
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:01:01 unloaded
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:03:05 The hot rod also has full interior btw, back + front seats, a dashboard, middle console, etc
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:14:56 you should probably ping the person who posted the wip
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:18:29 i'm honestly pretty proud of this Hot rod, it might be one of my favorite creations yet. Too bad it's not doing as well as i thought it would in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:35:30 nvm, it seems it's doing pretty fine now
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:37:10 now we're only missing the holy spirit
creations-chat 2020-08-22 21:39:33 ^
general 2020-08-22 21:54:34 just 8 bytes of ram? <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 21:55:30 yeah that happens sometimes, just rejoin and it'll fix it
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:09:46 Making some kind of airship/zeppelin/blimp/idk. Never done it before. It's not based off of anything, just making it up as i go
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:10:04 gonna be a giant propeller at the back here
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:10:25 it really do be a tube doe
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:13:06 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:13:53 only like 3/5 of the tube is done, and it's already 2059 blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:14:10 my biggest build yet
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:14:48 <@456226577798135808> no WIP in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:15:16 yeah, circles can be hard sometimes too
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:15:31 i wish they added larger cylinders
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:15:35 like 10x10
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:15:51 <@!280020722431295488> WIP in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:16:06 yes, but it's still against the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:16:40 what if they added tubes <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:17:32 truth
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:19:30 me passing out after they finally add tubes
creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:28:44 If you ever get sentenced to execution by **V O I D**, you better do it in style
creations-chat 2020-08-26 01:46:08 added double propellers and some rudders to the back of my airship
creations-chat 2020-08-26 01:48:23 How to annoy your server neighbours. Step 524:
creations-chat 2020-08-26 01:49:20 they do look a bit small in the pic
creations-chat 2020-08-26 01:57:54 Tip for anyone making airships with more than 1 propeller: make them spin opposite directions, at the same speed, otherwise your ship is just gonna roll...
creations-chat 2020-08-26 02:08:10 imagine a 1x1 wing panel... but shaped like this
creations-chat 2020-08-26 02:13:50 could be in a category called "Curved Wing Panels", and it'd have 1x1 -> 4x4
creations-chat 2020-08-26 02:14:22 would be pretty cool
creations-chat 2020-08-26 02:15:47 idk if it's worth suggesting tho
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:18:41 it really do be flyin doe
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:20:07 added an "engine" in the back, to power the propellers
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:22:02 <@!582834773773254656> maybe a Kv-2?
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:23:07 yeah, thought it would be a bit simpler considering the turret is basically just a box with a tube in the front
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:24:37 <@!453760206640513045> the more you practice, the better you're gonna get. It doesn't matter how bad your first plane is, because from there you can only get better
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:26:04 just practice
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:26:24 you cant get better if you dont practice
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:37:32 <@!280020722431295488> thanks
creations-chat 2020-08-26 13:47:55 **T U B E**
creations-chat 2020-08-26 14:30:44 oh no...
creations-chat 2020-08-26 14:45:26 just saved a guys 3k block build cuz he didn't know the "Undo" button existed. He accidentally saved some tiny build over it
creations-chat 2020-08-26 14:52:28 It's childish too
creations-chat 2020-08-26 15:01:50 <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-08-26 17:37:39 me when
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:04:27 Motorized couch.

Before:
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:04:32 
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:04:42 After:
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:04:49 
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:05:21 powered by 2 small propellers. One is for turning right, one for turning left. You go forward by powering both at the same time
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:05:54 Top speed: 69 sps
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:06:30 i suppose, but then i wont get as much power
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:06:43 i mean, 69 sps is pretty much perfect
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:07:24 i'll need a bit more speed to make it drift. I might add one of the bigger propellers just to try drifting a bit
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:10:31 how it looks without the back plate
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:19:59 So majestic..
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:34:05 I managed to sneak my motorized couch into someones house... i wonder how long it'll take them to notice
creations-chat 2020-08-26 19:38:45 i think someone noticed my couch, time to get outta here bois
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:41:17 bananacopter
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:41:58 🚁 +🍌
creations-chat 2020-08-26 22:13:43 tiny sportscar
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:11:30 i bet you've never seen a train drift this wide
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:15:33 a train track expansion would be really nice
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:15:40 bridges, tunnels, etc
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:17:03 also, more realistic train wheels would be nice. Irl, the bit that extends on top of the track is slightly cone shaped, making the train center itself. In-game, it's just a cylinder
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:17:14 much easier to derail
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:19:10 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:20:00 anyone know what's stopping them from adding more kinds of blocks, wedges, etc?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:20:16 hm
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:09:47 when people add so many locked motors it forms a tower
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:10:23 yeah, that's it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:10:32 it's basically to compress stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:10:44 or get shapes you normally wouldn't get by just building
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:11:56 i've seen worse
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:16:05 even the quality of the image is bothering
creations-chat 2020-08-31 10:46:13 <@!269122746766589952> more colours than just gray and dark gray
creations-chat 2020-08-31 10:48:10 i doubt it'll be possible to compress them to just 1x1x1, with no bits sticking out, but i salute you for taking on such a task
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:26:58 <@!495210490172014612> It's called "Creations chat", you can talk about creations in here...
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:27:32 <@!617287617603436547> The green is too bright
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:27:54 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:29:36 A tool for choosing which blocks weld to which would be nice
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:22:04 Im pretty sure that's a rotary engine
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:31:31 wider ones too
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:37:46 I feel like most people are gonna make the concorde. If you're going for originality, then i suggest not doing it, but if you think you have the skill to make the concorde better than most people, then sure
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:38:18 wouldn't surprise me if you do have the skill
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:42:40 probably
creations-chat 2020-09-01 11:43:50 try doing multi-account builds
general 2020-09-01 12:54:56 why is it... a pyramid

help 2020-09-01 22:26:15 ^^
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:08:18 what was the suggestion
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:18:00 be careful so you don't get suggestion blacklisted tho
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:33:11 <@!706662666810163350> cuz of updates, we have basically infinite save data now
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:34:26 what did the shutdown even do
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:34:58 is the new save data the update?
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:37:04 I wonder if it's possible to make an allah cube bigger than the plot through folding <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:37:35 you know how folding works?
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:37:55 260,000 before update
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:38:33 our save data has been increased by 15.4x
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:41:11 we have motors
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:52:07 You have to "invent" something new, that's basically never been done before in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:53:38 not invent in that sense, but like invent a new building technique or something along those lines. Something that changes the way many people play the game
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:55:04 "I invented the 1x4 triangle wedge"
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:55:18 what's a frog hopper
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:57:30 horns already exist
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:58:03 you could technically just use a speaker, and put a whistle sound on it
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:58:24 what is that
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:58:42 ah
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:58:56 steering wheels would be nice too
creations-chat 2020-09-02 17:59:58 make a grabber that encloses the seat as soon as you grab them
creations-chat 2020-09-03 07:52:13 🟫
creations-chat 2020-09-03 08:10:31 <@!311638025308209154> just make the green a tiny bit darker and it should be atleast a bit closer to the grass colour
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:35:50 WIP
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:35:56 
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:36:29 btw, i know the ramp is way too steep to actually function as vehicle ramp, it's more of a ramp for like all the other stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:37:31 perhaps
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:38:57 the angle is just to trick y'all, it's literally only this so far
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:39:43 could mean it just doesnt have a roof
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:40:09 i meant in the sense that it's only the back, and nothing else
creations-chat 2020-09-07 16:45:20 I think so
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:06:01 maybe use snow blaster?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 18:06:18 F
creations-chat 2020-09-08 09:22:47 that's how i did it on this car i made, each wheel is just a propeller with the cylinder facing outwards
creations-chat 2020-09-08 09:23:19 just some random "sports car"
creations-chat 2020-09-08 09:23:22 but perhaps
creations-chat 2020-09-08 09:38:24 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-08 09:42:58 <@!661550706511314944> propellers have 2 propellers though
creations-chat 2020-09-09 11:22:31 It's kinda a meme build, meaning you have a smaller chance of getting the rank, but if they accept it, you can get Expert Designer
creations-chat 2020-09-09 11:23:04 because i read the rules
creations-chat 2020-09-09 11:24:13 that jet would only get Designer I
creations-chat 2020-09-09 11:24:29 same with skateboard

creations-chat 2020-09-14 18:09:53 reason?
creations-chat 2020-09-14 18:11:09 you're not really supposed to hit the max speed btw, it's just something car companies use to brag
creations-chat 2020-09-14 18:17:38 aventador
creations-chat 2020-09-15 09:54:26 <@!572411935669354528> If you're going for accuracy, then the size is pretty good, it's just where they are that needs a bit of adjusting
creations-chat 2020-09-15 09:54:40 (the air intakes)
creations-chat 2020-09-15 09:56:26 well, it should technically be possible to do it using Motor 2
creations-chat 2020-09-15 09:59:43 <@!641137745846337537>
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:26:44 how about a runway that you can flip upside down. On one side, a runway. On the other side, a wooden floor, or something like that
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:34:04 <:wot:695654208837255219>
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:34:34 why is it blue/light-purple?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:35:48 i'd suggest using gray instead
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:38:50 <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:40:16 looks like the nuclear reactor on the mars rovers lol
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:42:53 ok but what about shortened passanger plane? Like, just the cockpit + back wing-section, and slap some huge wings on that
creations-chat 2020-09-15 21:19:57 my hover vehicle keeps tipping, anyone know how to fix this?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 21:25:16 Nvm, i figured out what caused the tipping
creations-chat 2020-09-15 21:25:55 unfortunately, the only way to fix it made my vehicle look not as good
creations-chat 2020-09-16 16:42:21 basically

creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:32:59 what is that
creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:33:22 im hesitant
creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:34:01 gonna use incognito for this search..
creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:34:58 I got literally 0 results for specifically "Michael reeves youtube body", only links to his youtube channel, twitter, etc.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:35:18 im so confused
creations-chat 2020-09-16 17:36:00 uh

creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:39:43 why
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:40:10 could you send a link to it?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:41:41 i feel like you could have made that with less blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:41:49 especially the sub docking station
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:42:00 looks pretty basic, so idk why single blocks were needed
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:42:06 (sub docking station)
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:43:01 that's dope
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:43:19 they might be a bit thin, but not too noticable
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:43:29 other than that, looks really good
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:47:31 you should probably fix that
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:47:36 it might get a lower score because of that
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:49:09 <@!683069192143896594> repost it

creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:06:40 anyone know any programs/websites i can use to pick colours from an image?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:10:29 <@!683069192143896594> when i try uploading my image it doesn't work
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:16:15 Tip for y'all: try to stand up as much as possible during online school
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:16:19 to prevent blood clots
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:18:28 i actually like online school. It's mostly because i have a 50 minute commute to my school, and i hate the food they serve (along with like 90% of the other students)
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:19:02 who
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:19:15 link the post
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:20:21 the wings are a bit weird
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:20:54 because a large part of players are annoying
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:22:24 it doesn't really look that good. The wings are too thin, and they have some kind of thinner wings underneath it (?), and the body itself is really basic
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:24:03 same
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:29:24 If any of y'all have a lot of spare time, go to google and search "maz-7907", and then just start counting down. 7906, 7905, 7904, etc. you will see some strange vehicles
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:30:57 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:30:59 like that
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:31:08 maz-7904 is one of my favorites

creations-chat 2020-09-18 13:32:06 i mean
creations-chat 2020-09-18 13:32:23 the cockpit of the maz-7310 is basically a cage i guess?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 13:51:36 It was made to handle going through rough terrain, so it pretty much is one
creations-chat 2020-09-18 14:01:42 i was on the server when they were building it. when unloaded, it was literally as wide as the entire plot
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:23:04 self upvoting is useless, it doesnt even count towards the total score when you for example try to get a rank
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:29:58 <@!683847069890510887> The detailing needs more work. It just looks like you slapped a bunch of cylinders on it. They need to fit in more
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:46:15 first you need a score of atleast 60, then you need to ask a staff member to submit it, then people vote on it, then if it gets enough votes it gets into hall of fame.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:46:51 one or two what?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:48:14 also, the rule is only for *excessive* mini modding
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:48:36 only a few messages is not excessive
creations-chat 2020-09-19 15:24:24 honestly why do people even self upvote... it doesn't even count towards the full score when you apply for ranks

creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:11:19 here's basically the shape the spaceship is gonna have
creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:13:19 googled it and uh... i have *no* idea what that is
creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:14:04 only that it's from the "From the Depths" game

creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:24:45 any
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:25:39 i suggest the CCX, cuz it's pretty basic compared to the newer ones
creations-chat 2020-09-19 21:26:17 the windshield might be hard now that i think about it, but should be do-able
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:15:26 the roof is too thicc
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:16:36 i think it actually is a convertible, so that's accurate
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:18:19 the CCX did have a convertible version, so i think the normal one is *not* convertible
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:18:54 btw the way you take the roof off was very unexpected when i first saw it
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:19:09 you just unhook some stuff and then place it in the front-trunk
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:19:31 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:19:58 you know how some cars have a trunk in the front? The CCX convertible instead had a space to hold the roof in the front
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:20:11 idk where the storage for any other stuff was tho
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:25:35 i think the only way to make it less chunky and square is to make it bigger
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:28:31 yeh im now convinced the only way to fix that is to scale it up
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:29:19 as a swede, i feel obligated to fix this
creations-chat 2020-09-19 22:32:01 i have a vid saved that would induse even more pain but idk if i ca share it here lol

creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:52:05 Quick build to avoid boredom. A steering system that can turn a vehicle, without actually turning the wheels
creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:52:23 
creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:53:13 the suspension reduces wheel wobble
creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:54:42 to be clear: The suspension in the build is just to make the rotating smoother, nothing else
creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:54:54 motors can
creations-chat 2020-09-23 11:55:48 exactly, that's why i need the suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:01:58 I think i figured out how my boredom-creation turns without turning the wheels. It turns thanks to a difference in the turning circle between the wheels. When one of the wheels are moved closer to the back wheels, it changes the turning circle to turn more towards that side.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:03:47 y'all should stop before mods get involved, just so you know

creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:08:05 why
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:08:17 why not just screenshot
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:08:53 he removed it
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:10:33 so anyways, back to my horrendous creation
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:10:39 it turns using only 1 motor
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:13:31 i discovered a hidden feature of my turning mechanism
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:14:07 when you turn it in place, without driving, it slowly slides backwards in the opposite direction of the turning
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:14:15 for some reason
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:15:15 well, it is a bug, so it shouldn't even be happening
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:15:24 so pretty strong if you consider that

creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:22:10 smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:23:41 Im guessing it's for a tank, right?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:25:39 I suggest moving the wheels closer to eachother, or using bigger wheels, so they look more like one track. Right now it just looks like a bunch of wheels
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:27:08 try using motor locking to reduce it to 0.5 blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:27:16 it'd make a big difference
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:28:48 if they touch, the spinning of the wheels would make it a bit glitchy, so i suggest using 0.5
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:35:21 *n o*
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:37:23 it's basically just a gimmick

creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:01:42 well, it's mostly from experience i guess. I ride the bus every day, so i've pretty much memorized the interior
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:01:54 yeah, for school
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:02:07 ah

creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:46:26 <@!484529511468236802> 8/10 COULD USE A BIT MORE DETAILING, AND SOME MORE DIFFERENT COLOURS !!! ALSO, WHY ARE WE YELLING
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:47:29 Yeah that shade good, but i mean like some more variety in the shade. Not came, just some variety to make it look less smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:47:39 **camo
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:48:13 maybe a bit
creations-chat 2020-09-24 00:48:34 either that, or too short
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:02:10 one side pretty much done

creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:01:07 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:10:11 Im not sure how long i should make the bus. I need assistance. (I know it has to be longer than it currently is, obviously)
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:12:32 i feel like im gonna need to do some folding...
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:15:47 I feel like vertical folding might be better, considering how i get the windows into place
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:18:23 thank you
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:35:17 no matter what button i press, my motor 2 only goes one direction... how fix
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:35:56 changing button fixed it
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:41:36 this length good?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:42:14 i think so, idk bus terminology
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:42:38 what server u on?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:45:04 it used to be 15 seconds like an hour ago
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:45:40 some idiots decided to have a big argument in here
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:49:22 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/436476443891990538/758162016568475678/pet_tonk.gif
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:51:34 They should just add a "No arguing in <#504436696021204992>" rule, and mute people who break it
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:52:19 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:55:06 you're seriously comparing mods who dont allow arguing to a person who killed millions of people... ?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:55:24 what the actual
creations-chat 2020-09-24 20:57:20 you're asking for a swedish turbine engine to build?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 21:16:51 no
creations-chat 2020-09-24 21:17:34 small scale, which means not alot of detail
creations-chat 2020-09-24 21:18:22 build it at a bigger scale next time and you might get more likes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 21:19:11 yeah people here either want to see huge stuff, or super tiny stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-24 21:20:04 mind showing it?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:33:36 😎
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:34:26 btw, the bus is almost 1200 blocks so far, and i havent even done the interior yet
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:37:01 <@!710208141144489995> The answer to ur first question is, quite a bit of motor locking... and yes, it was a pain to build
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:37:48 because i need to do motorlocking for the window frames, and that restricted horizontal fold a bit
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:38:30 <@456226577798135808>  what server u on?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:39:27 <@!484529511468236802>  what server u on?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:40:19 ah, may i join? Nick said he was gonna join u, and i wanna try fit my bus into his vtol lol
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:40:30 i doubt itll work, but i can try
creations-chat 2020-09-24 22:50:05 np
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:09:21 I didn't check the block count on my bus for a while and uhh...
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:28:32 once when i was on the expert vip server 1 someone was making a multi-account water bottle, literally as wide as the plot, but i guess they didnt post it, or didnt get around to finishing it
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:30:55 can you get several ranks from one build tho?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:50:50 my 2.2k block bus is finally complete, i'll send pics in a few min
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:06 Everyone slow down y'all talking, im finna post a bunch of pics
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:16 
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:25 
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:36 
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:45 
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:54:53 done
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:56:49 i probably should've gone to sleep and finished my bus tomorrow, instead of building for 6 hours straight until 4 am...
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:58:26 well, it doesnt feel like tomorrow
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:00:48 that's legit like 5 blocks... how has that not been removed for low effort
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:02:47 2 rules broken at the same time
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:23:30 h
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:23:47 it me
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:43:02 <@!414359638302130176> do you honestly think big ben is the name of the clockface?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:44:32 Big ben is the nickname of the bell inside (it's official name is the great bell of westminster), not the clockface..
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:46:27 <@!414359638302130176>
<@!414778672847781888>
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:54:09 yeah, many people use it that way, but it's not the real name of the clock or the clock tower. The fact that many people use the name for the clock and clock tower is because of ignorance.
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:55:04 the bell is big ben, the tower is Elizabeth tower, the clockface = idk
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:55:36 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:56:49 google "gaming pc" and just copy the pc u find
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:57:35 **oh**
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:58:11 just use a half block, make it metal material, then colour it a dark shade of gray
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:58:28 should be close enough to a pc
creations-chat 2020-09-25 12:59:35 im gonna downvote just cuz you begged
creations-chat 2020-09-25 13:00:19 i meant the other direction
creations-chat 2020-09-25 13:06:50 so... many... ladders...
creations-chat 2020-09-25 13:07:45 the ladders dont really fit in tbh. It might be the colours
creations-chat 2020-09-25 13:09:17 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2020-09-25 13:10:45 if you either made the colours of the ladders brighter, or the colour of the ship darker, they would fit in better
creations-chat 2020-09-25 15:31:04 did someone @ everyone? I cant find any ping directed to me
creations-chat 2020-09-25 15:32:57 ah
creations-chat 2020-09-25 15:35:50 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-25 15:36:14 maybe they pinged me then deleted it. idk how that stuff works, but might be possible
creations-chat 2020-09-25 15:36:30 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
general 2020-09-25 15:37:35 a few days ago someone posted a gulag in there though, and people went apeshit
general 2020-09-25 15:37:59 <@!567843824395747367> a gulag?
general 2020-09-25 15:40:32 yes, it is something bad
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:01:48 Added overhead storage. The bus is now 2350 blocks..
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:02:55 aslong as it doesnt have your adress on it, sure
creations-chat 2020-09-25 16:07:29 thanks
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:32:18 <@456226577798135808> your highest amount of upvotes?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:36:28 congrats
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:37:33 if it gets 3 more upvotes you can apply for Expert Designer [V]
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:55:43 covered up the bottom of the bus using wings and motor locking, to hide the interior floor, aswell as some motor locking for the walls.
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:55:53 it's now up to 2496 blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:56:14 i was originally planning on using disconnectors to make the bottom, but i used wings instead, to save weight
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:56:26 also looks better
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:57:55 I might need to add ballast blocks tho, cuz with the added wings the bus slides around a tiny bit more. It might be more realistic with a bit of sliding, but i think i prefer it stop faster.
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:58:39 For being 2.5k blocks, it handles really well
creations-chat 2020-09-25 17:59:43 top speed is 82, max turning angle on the wheels is 50 degrees but i could probably increase it if i wanted to
creations-chat 2020-09-25 18:00:21 Correction: 82 is max speed in a straight line. In a corner it can go up to 96

creations-chat 2020-09-26 18:22:42 well congrats frobloxian for getting into pinned messages... i guess

creations-chat 2020-09-30 12:10:19 btw if you go around the back of it, you can see someone has crashed into the tonk at one point <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-09-30 12:11:05 yeah, a thing behind the tonk is cracked, in the shape of the tonk, as if someone has crashed into it

creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:47:31 time to add the last piece
creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:48:29 the painting process is so tedious, but the fade will look pretty good at the end
creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:51:56 it's gonna be quite a bit taller when the last piece is done. I'm also gonna add an evil lair at the top, with a 360 degree window, so i can do me evil business
creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:52:32 i might add an elevator too
creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:53:29 this thing is gonna be like 6k+ blocks...
creations-chat 2020-09-30 21:56:30 use cameras for the wing
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:00:11 shape done, time for pain
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:01:58 btw, the fade just starts at 0, 0, 0 and for each block it goes up, the rgb values go up by 1. so layer 1 = 0,0,0. Layer 2 = 1,1,1. Etc.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:03:24 yeah...
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:03:40 the start of the 4th fold is at 115
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:04:17 and with the 4th fold, i basically have to paint each block individually, because it's so tight
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:06:51 i mean... i have only done school work in 1 subject in the last 2 weeks

creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:09:45 colour is too dark. Shape is too blocky
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:10:01 needs to be smoother
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:10:57 the windshield for example. The wedge at the top looks very out of place, and blocky.
creations-chat 2020-09-30 22:11:50 it's basically just an tapered octagon too
creations-chat 2020-10-01 15:32:37 fade is complete. Only took like 2 hours
creations-chat 2020-10-01 15:34:11 nice

creations-chat 2020-10-01 15:37:29 <@!356272139826888705> the bit directly above the cockpit needs to be smoother

creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:29:51 the transition from the sides to the front needs to be smoother. Also, the front looks a bit too short
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:32:41 <@!439829923192897536>
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:33:24 you might need to use motor locking, to make a wedge longer than 1x4
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:33:40 at the curve
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:34:26 You can use motor 2 to rotate a 1x7, then motor lock it into place using TNT
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:34:56 there's probably a youtube tutorial for it

creations-chat 2020-10-08 20:06:21 i hate the fact that whether you can paint the conveyor of the conveyor block depends on how it's facing, how many times you've replaced it, if you've placed any more conveyors since the last time you tried, what day of the week it is, if you've seen a black cat in the last 48 hours, how many millenia it's been since the planets aligned, and some other factors

creations-chat 2020-10-12 14:33:39 Fixed the colours a bit. Made the tracks more gray, and brighter. Also made the gray metal more blue.

creations-chat 2020-10-12 14:40:16 im gonna add conveyors underneath the tracks later
creations-chat 2020-10-12 14:40:45 it's actually pretty close to 1:1 scale rn

creations-chat 2020-10-12 14:43:45 scale is pretty much 1:1, might actually be a tiny tiny bit too small
creations-chat 2020-10-12 14:44:35 (based on the height of the character, the scale is 1:1)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 15:01:23 yeah the tread itself is thick, but idk how to do tracks with signs yet

creations-chat 2020-10-12 15:26:24 temporarily fixed my stupidity, also changed the horns to tiny landing gears cuz i realised i wouldn't be able to make all 4 tread pairs using horns
creations-chat 2020-10-12 15:26:56 they dont look as good, so that's a bummer
creations-chat 2020-10-12 15:27:28 whomst is miner

creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:39:11 i mean, like, making it blank, without any text
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:52:15 First time trying treads with signs. Didn't turn out too bad i think. There are some spots that might need some fixing, like the transition near the top middle, but that'd be a bit too complicated for the effort to be worth it.
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:52:31 could be worse
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:54:23 <@!407347404858458123> idk uh... treads maybe? considering it just looks like an 8 wheeled truck right now
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:55:47 does motor 2 automatically rotate when motor locked? I never even noticed my motor 2's on the sign-treads rotated automatically

creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:13:17 4 blocks?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:13:56 I wanted to do 3 blocks wide, but since im using propeller blades where the track curves, it can only be in incriments of 2
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:16:04 Not only to these tracks look WAY better compared to my last ones, they require way less motor locking, and take up less space around the tracks.
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:16:36 <@!484529511468236802> you havent seen the motor locking on my last ones?

creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:19:40 <@!484529511468236802> are the tracks only 1 block wide? If so, it'll be pretty much impossible considering propeller wings are 1x2, so you'll have to use motor 2 alot

creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:26:11 might just start using <#384021699466756107> instead, considering this chat is literally unusable for actual conversations about creations now

<@!407347404858458123> I use this channel for talking about builds. A 2 minute slowmode is gonna make actual conversations about creations literally impossible, because people aren't patient enough to have a 30 minute conversations about something that they could normally get done talking about within 3-4 minutes with the 15 second slowmode.
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:34:49 because obc made the slowmode 2 minutes

creations-chat 2020-10-15 08:19:37 > what would it be tho
<@!447221768520859659> something like: 80 upvotes, aswell as your creation has to gets into <#627195143040139264>, for the Master Designer [X] rank
creations-chat 2020-10-15 08:20:53 80 would fit the incriment increase of the designer rank. But i guess 90, max 100, would work
creations-chat 2020-10-15 09:06:36 100 seems like a good amount, not too high, not too low
creations-chat 2020-10-15 09:29:21 I ain't even gonna have space for a fucking interior if i keep going like this...

creations-chat 2020-10-29 15:42:55 if the feet of the robot are shaped like this (One foot is infront of the other, from above), then it should theoretically stay upright, if the centre of mass is inbetween the space where the feet overlap.

creations-chat 2020-10-29 19:24:38 they need to curve, so yes
creations-chat 2020-10-29 19:30:43 yes, but it should extend a bit longer out, beyond the edge of the gray stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-29 19:31:45 either make the gray part smaller, or make the curve of the bullets longer
creations-chat 2020-10-29 19:35:31 <@!566765848354750514> Also, for the bullets, you can use Metal material + 185, 155, 80.

And yeah, that is pretty much perfect

iron golems are pretty brainless so it genuinely thinks that that villager is an enemy. If the villager took off the makeup, instead of attacking itself it'd probably just go about its bussiness

creations-chat 2020-11-06 19:53:01 <@!270580472638078977> The windows are too tall compared to the wall-part underneath the windows.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 19:55:21 <@!270580472638078977> Use a half wedge down 1x2 ontop of a half block, so the windows are 1 block shorter, and then you can make the wall-part 1 block taller

you would also have to make the walls 0.5 blocks instead of 1, but i actually think that would be a bit more realistic too
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:01:26 <@!270580472638078977> Here's another tip: Make the roof a tiny bit more curved

the-dump 2020-11-11 18:51:33 imagine if USA had to get rid of 1% of their entire yearly income... that'd be around 176 billion dollars *literally* going in the trash.
the-dump 2020-11-11 18:52:40 denmark will recover of course, but losing 1% of their yearly income is still alot of money

Didn't think i was gonna fit in interior, but i just barely did it. The driver seat even rotates, to more easily get out. Fits 5 people. (Still WIP)

creations-chat 2020-11-12 14:20:50 People usually get creations blacklist when they post something stupid in <#384025409945337856>, like creations that aren't theirs.

Made a 6th version of my spaceship, got help from HerrGuggi with the air intakes and the lights. Still not 100% done yet, needs underside and some fixing in the rear.
creations-chat 2020-11-12 17:08:20 definitely still needs some work...

creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:22:15 apparently the vote for my build has begun <:PogStare:699130318510227537> | yes hof
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:24:36 I have my doubts about whether it's gonna get accepted tbh, considering the stuff i've seen in hof recently
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:28:17 that only becomes a problem when you send several pics at once right?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:30:54 when you see some motor lock monstrosity that takes up 90% of the plot before loading, and becomes like a tiny hyper-detailed thing, you do kinda want to see the build mode, but usually the pics are pretty boring
creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:34:13 > I usually upload my creationz with building mode because some people can't see the actual effort
<@456226577798135808> Exactly, it's sometimes hard to understand the effort people go through to do stuff, which is why sometimes it is actually better to post build mode than not to, cuz people appreciate it more, and thus are more likely to upvote

creations-chat 2020-11-13 10:50:42 Just woke up and i see this... Honestly wasn't expecting to get that many upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-13 10:54:01 that definitely raises my confidence about the modeler test atleast a bit
creations-chat 2020-11-13 10:56:06 <@!416152900960780290> The "Modeler test" is when you apply for HOF. The image gets sent to the chat only modelers and mods have access to, and they vote on whether it should get into HOF
creations-chat 2020-11-13 10:57:38 pretty sure it's not even possible to get modeler anymore
creations-chat 2020-11-13 10:59:10 so, if you get into HOF, modelers can vote on whether you should get modeler or not? Didn't even know that until now
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:00:41 dang.. well, worth a try i guess
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:02:16 well, even if i don't get HOF i'll still be happy i got almost 100 upvotes on a non-meme build

creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:56:05 <@!192861290677534722> doesn't matter if it really is low effort or not, it all depends on whether a mod considers a literal flying orange brick low effort or not.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:57:38 There isn't really anything to defend. What a mod says is final, they decide whether it stays or not.

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 12:53:40 i think the upvote requirement on pretty much all ranks except designer are too low

general 2020-12-01 11:59:41 haven't tried vertically tho
general 2020-12-01 12:09:51 that's not really a bet, considering the odds of you getting less than 10 upvotes for it if it's bad enough is like 95%

plane-crazy 2020-12-01 12:26:00 nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:05:45 Part of why outlines look better sometimes is because you can more easily see the shape of the thing in the pic, so it's pretty useless/bad on builds that aren't hard to see the shape of.

creations-chat 2021-09-11 22:56:36 It's really just cuz i've had 10000+ combined hours in many different 3D building games and CAD-programs, so i just kinda know how to make stuff in 3D

creations-chat 2021-09-28 17:18:52 100 upvotes aren't enough to get in tho, your build also gets voted on in some other chat, (idk what it's called), by experienced players. They're the ones who decide whether your post gets into hall of fame

<@!791976765123592233> Yeah. Otherwise tons of stuff that doesn't deserve to get it, would.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 17:22:30 Pretty sure they review all posts above 100 upvotes (That get submitted for the vote), as long as they're not low effort builds.

plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:29:49 idk, i figured it out myself
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:31:38 I've used the technique before when I made this
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:32:23 It got 300 upvotes when i posted it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:37:42 It's essentially just stacking angle locks. You attach each piece to the one next to it, so rotating one piece rotates all of the ones after it. Then you motorlock them towards eachother 1.5 blocks (3 motors).
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:39:42 It's pretty compact so I won't really be able to explain it very well, but here's a pic of how it works
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:40:01 behind each explosive is a locked motor
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:40:19 the upside down motors are the ones that angle the pieces

plane-crazy 2021-10-17 21:44:18 I don't suggest you do it though, cuz the more pieces you add, the more uncontrollable it becomes

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 09:55:15 like 90% of my builds are just for fun, but sometimes i do make builds specifically to get ranks, like for shipwright and aeronautical

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 10:00:23 In case you're wondering why i think the ship im working on will get hof, it's cuz it's in a ship category that hasn't been done alot, and especially not with the amount of detail and effort i'm doing, and i'm also pretty sure the build method i'm using hasn't been used in any current hof build

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 10:02:01 i did a factory reset like 2 weeks ago so i don't have my pics anymore, and it'd take a while to get the build set up
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 10:03:13 Another reason why i'm waiting til pc2 comes out is cuz im hoping there's gonna be a tool to move specific sections of a build, cuz otherwise i'll have to move like 2k blocks of the build by hand
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 10:03:47 like 15 blocks i think

creations-chat 2022-01-03 17:25:29 It's a bad build, but not low effort. Yours was just a box with wheels, this build has a more complex shape, and the builder has spent time coloring it. Yours didn't even have paint.

in blocks
creations-chat 2022-01-21 19:03:12 you sure? isn't it a different height than width?
creations-chat 2022-01-21 19:08:22 So i did some calculations, and, assuming you can fit 8 pieces of it on one account (6 blocks of height for each, stacked on top of eachother, that you then fold out.) You would need just under 100000 accounts to fit just the first level of the backrooms. (assuming 1 block = around 0.75 meters)
creations-chat 2022-01-21 19:11:47 The person who originally posted the backrooms concept (Atleast i think it's them), said it was around 600 million square miles in the post, which is what im basing the calculation off of.

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 14:05:09 it doesn't look very efficient, but i guess it works since it's on a plane

general 2022-01-24 21:41:00 about how far apart were the train wheels?
general 2022-01-24 21:41:46 i've found that 1 train wheel apart is a pretty good distance. More than that and the odds of derailing increases
general 2022-01-24 21:44:09 if you're doing a longer train, the things with the train wheels on them need to be connected to the main body of the train with essentially a ball-joint, if you want to go up the hill

general 2022-01-24 22:24:46 how much per hour is that?
general 2022-01-24 22:26:26 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, maybe around 50 weeks a year, so around 2000 hours a year. 53972/2000 = around 27 dollars an hour
general 2022-01-24 22:26:43 yeah
general 2022-01-24 22:29:39 well the more racist a person becomes, the less likely it is for them to realise it's wrong, so maybe never
general 2022-01-24 22:31:23 not good, 7.5 is better, since it's a multiple of 90 minutes, and one "sleep cycle" is around 90 minutes. If you wake up at the end of a cycle, you'll feel the most rested

general 2022-01-24 22:36:20 No, you still need to sleep a reasonable amount per day, it's just better if that amount is a multiple of 90 minutes
general 2022-01-24 22:37:20 was just about to mention that. You can take 90 minute naps 5 times per day and feel rested
general 2022-01-24 22:38:06 you'll feel very unrested, since you probably wont even enter REM sleep

general 2022-01-30 01:12:31 why wouldn't it be?
general 2022-01-30 01:16:08 Well, i'm assuming you'd just need go to one place that doesn't tax alcohol, transport it back to where you live, without paying taxes for it. I kinda know of it from a trick that essentially is that, but in europe.
general 2022-01-30 01:19:14 In Sweden, you can drive to other (european) countries and buy untaxed alcohol, then drive it back to sweden, so essentially alcohol tax evasion. **BUT**, it is only for when it's for personal use only. If you're planning on sharing it with anyone, then it's illegal.
general 2022-01-30 01:19:31 ?
general 2022-01-30 01:21:17 Yeah, the trick was even shown on TV once, where a guy bought A LOT of alcohol in denmark i think? (could've been germany), and didn't have to pay taxes for it, since it was for personal use only
general 2022-01-30 01:22:01 tax free shop
general 2022-01-30 01:22:56 nah, like the tax free stores at airports, but at a border crossing
general 2022-01-30 01:25:13 Well they mostly just trust you to be honest, but I guess if they notice suspicious behavior they might do an investigation to see if you're running an alcohol smuggling business
general 2022-01-30 01:26:24 I don't see the appeal for alcohol tbh, most of it just tastes like hand sanitizer to me
general 2022-01-30 01:27:20 pretty much the only alcoholic beverage i drink is cider
general 2022-01-30 01:27:46 yeah

creations-chat 2022-01-30 02:14:04 probably wouldn't get in tbh, partially because it's not a very original build. Tons of people have built similar things. (Maybe not detail wise, but the type of build.)

the-dump 2022-01-30 02:25:20 well canonically the second world war happened in the cars universe, so probably
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:26:56 no. Do you wipe your eyes with your eyebrows?
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:27:21 well kinda, but with my eyelids closed
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:29:21 Depends on what they would define as a race of car. Technically, us humans are one species, but we all don't look the same. It could be like that in the cars universe, where they're all the same race, but only look differently due to genetics.
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:29:48 yeah
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:30:05 well those words can mean the same depending on the context.
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:31:13 Nah it would rather be like an organ transplant

the-dump 2022-01-30 02:33:35 Well yeah, eyes are an organ, and they have eyes, so yes they have organs.
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:35:25 genuinely possible, since aliens canonically exist in the cars universe

the-dump 2022-01-30 02:42:12 yeah
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:46:08 <@!424656494949040129> Basically, my idea was, what if the cars universe is kinda the same as All Tomorrows, in the sense that the cars were genetically engineered by the aliens to have specific purposes, cuz some cars are born to essentially have one purpose in life. (Transport other cars, etc.) Might be far fetched, but would explain some stuff, like how they even evolved into what they are now.
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:48:14 rust wouldn't just effect skin though, it'd also make movement harder
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:51:20 Well one creature living and depending on another creature exists in real life, so it makes sense that it'd do the same in the cars universe
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:52:53 well there's microscopic animals living in the pores on your face, so technically inside you
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:53:46 yes, because Christianity exists in the cars universe
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:56:55 it is 4am

the-dump 2022-01-30 03:01:26 built in, since most of them don't have arms. Only some have arms, like the forklifts.

general 2022-01-31 22:38:21 Couldn't resist doin the numbers, and, if you use the car with the longest distance driven as the basis for how many kilometers per year (A volvo 1800S, bought in 1966, with around 4.8 million kilometers driven), it'd take around 11.5 thousand years to reach 1 billion kilometers driven.
general 2022-01-31 22:43:48 Ok, if could drive it without stopping for any reason what so ever, it'd take around 1200 years, assuming you go an average of around 90 km/h, which is a pretty average highway speed.

plane-crazy 2022-02-03 19:35:14 maybe some more color variation / texturing on this area, looks a bit empty/bland there
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 19:37:33 i meant specifically the skin in that area, it looks like just one color, and as such looks kinda bland there
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 19:39:31 well you should still add some color variation to the skin, so it looks more detailed. You can still add stuff on top of the skin

creations-chat 2022-02-03 23:50:32 paris class has been done by tons of people, so if you're looking to make a more original build, do the stalwart. If you're going for looks, i'd do paris class, cuz it's better looking in my opinion.

In short: stalwart is more original, paris is better looking

creations-chat 2022-02-04 01:09:33 You can still turn up the graphics for like a few seconds to take the pic. Fps doesn't matter when taking a picture...
creations-chat 2022-02-04 01:12:44 When i had a laptop that could barely get 15 fps on lowest settings, i still turned the graphics all the way up for pics. Unless your game literally crashes the instant you turn up the graphics, the performance of whatever device you're using is not an excuse to take bad pics.

the-dump 2022-02-21 21:42:32 It isn't free, you pay for the video by watching ads. Even though it isn't a direct payment from your pocket, it's still payment. Also, downloading content without the creators permission is copyright infringement, and therefore illegal, no matter what you use it for. Even if you're not making money from it, it's still copyright infringement.
the-dump 2022-02-21 21:43:59 Yes, which is only availible to youtube premium subscribers, which costs money.
the-dump 2022-02-21 21:51:41 <@!808944604069363734> I should also mention that some videos *are* legal to download, for example public domain videos. How long a video takes to enter the public domain varies depending on lots of things, like country of origin, but I think the minimum is 50 years for company-produced content, like movies.
the-dump 2022-02-21 21:54:02 If nothing else causes the time to extend more than 50 years, then yes, you can legally download it without permission.
the-dump 2022-02-21 21:55:50 If it was produced by a single person though, you have to wait 70 years after the creator dies, for it to enter public domain. (not 100% sure about this one though)
the-dump 2022-02-21 21:56:30 Like i said earlier, this varies country to country though, so you'd probably need to do your own research to be sure

the-dump 2022-02-22 20:13:31 lighting seems right to me, the wall behind him has shadows in the same direction as he does
general 2022-02-22 20:43:04 slightly taller than average, so not tall, but slightly tall
general 2022-02-22 20:44:45 stand against a wall, place a flat object (like a book) on your head, measure distance between the object and the floor with a measuring tape
general 2022-02-22 20:47:01 well finding a 180+ cm ruler is unlikely, so your best bet then is either to go to the school nurse (There should be a way of measuring your height there), or just buying a measuring tape
general 2022-02-22 20:48:49 only way is to go buy a measuring tape then, or go to a hospital and ask to measure your height there
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:52:06 neither
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:53:34 The color <@!489224908732104717> suggested is better.
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:53:56 100,125,100
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:55:23 it's better than the two colors you suggested imo
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:58:05 first one is better
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:58:53 which green, the one you had earlier?

creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:13:18 Well, the longer periods between good builds is cuz of the fact they take longer to build. And the fact that they seem to come in periods might actually be related to the days of the week, and school breaks. (more good builds on the weekend, and during breaks, cuz good builders are usually older, and therefore don't have as much time during the weekdays to build, cuz they're busy with school).

general 2022-05-12 22:35:43 Considering the strange paintjob, i'd assume it's an early production model of an unreleased car. Car companies sometimes use paintjobs like that to make it harder to make out the design of the car.

creations-chat 2022-05-13 22:56:51 - Engine is a nice touch, looks pretty good.
- The roof of the cab looks flat and plain. Maybe put some roof vent or something like that to make it more detailed.
- The two ladders on the thing behind the cab look a bit out of place. Maybe replace them with a 1x3 sign block, painted like the rest of the vehicle.
- Consider adding more small details, like trail blocks. They can work as small pipes, edges, etc.

creations-chat 2022-05-16 21:23:39 Well, there are a lot of problems with the jet itself, but it might actually be easier to just try to improve your next jet instead of trying to fix this one. Every build doesn't need to be perfect, as long as you learn from it.
creations-chat 2022-05-16 21:26:19 I suggest you do a slightly larger scale next time, so you can more easily hide stuff. Larger scale is also better for detailing.

general 2022-05-17 22:30:32 it me
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:32:08 hype leads to high expectations, high expectations leads to dissapointment.
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:35:29 from what i've heard, plots are gonna be bigger in two directions, and smaller in one, so idk if they're really gonna be that much bigger, probably just slightly
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:36:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:36:30 also map might have an infinite ocean, which is nice
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:37:31 I wonder what's preventing rick from making the plots like 10x bigger tho
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:41:15 well one thing people don't seem to be discussing that much is the fact that the flight physics are gonna be different. Drag is actually gonna be like in real life
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:41:40 so gliders are gonna be possible
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:43:01 well, helicopters both lose and gain from the better flight physics, idk which difference is gonna be bigger tho
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:43:04 might cancel out

plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:50:05 I think only like 3 or 4 of my builds don't use motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:53:12 probably the thing i'm looking forward to the most is motors not bugging around when you move them a tiny amount. One of my most detailed WIP builds literally can't function cuz of buggy motors.
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:53:44 trangle
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:54:22 OR, make it so you can make custom wedges.
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:56:10 most likely not
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:56:37 we'll get some bugfixes, and some cool features, but overall will still feel like the same game
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:57:34 having too much freedom isn't good either though. Having some restriction to your building (like blocks), is good for creativity
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 22:59:35 highways will be nice, considering cars/land vehicles is the main thing i build. I rarely make planes tbh
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 23:01:09 as far as i know, the new map will technically be infinite, it's just that the infinite part is just gonna be water, with an island

creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:03:59 It's not that hard. I did it on literally my first try
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:08:06 The first one i did was a tugboat, so very rounded. But my latest angle locked ship is a battleship, with a slightly rounded front. Angle locked hulls don't need to be straight, they can be rounded. It just depends on a few things, one of which is how the "panels" are shaped. If they're convex, straight, or concave.
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:11:50 <@438388553442131988> By "rounded", you mean like this right? Or do you mean the shape from above?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:13:59 Oh, that's the easy part. The front is the hard part
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:18:36 <@438388553442131988> Here's an early pic of my new angle locked ship, with a rounded hull (both from above and the side). So rounded angle-locked hulls are do-able. It's actually  easier than most people think. Just 7 motors per "panel". One for rotating, and 6 for locking in place.
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:20:44 Oh. It's much easier to use vertical wedges, cuz then u only need to rotate in one axis.
creations-chat 2022-08-24 22:40:24 It's gaps in the wing
creations-chat 2022-08-25 00:30:47 <@583389282241085443> The colors are so bad... Way too saturated.

2. Don't post dark photos. You'll get downvoted cuz people can barely see the build.
3. Don't later complain when you get downvoted for doing those exact things. 💀

Also, if it's just a slightly different version of an old build, maybe include a link to that old build, so people can see what you changed.

plane-crazy 2022-08-27 03:00:14 There are tutorials on youtube. Just search something like "roblox plane crazy motorlock tutorial", and then do the same for angle-locking.

plane-crazy 2022-09-16 15:40:43 It depends on what you mean. You can use cylinders powered by motors, or you can make a custom tire with motor-locking and angle-locking, which is then powered by motors.

Blue motors set the angle of the segment. Speed of each blue motor increases by 0.1 for each extra segment. (1st segment is 0.1, 2nd is 0.2, 3rd is 0.3, etc.) Pink motor spins the whole thing after locking it in place. Every motor that isn't pink or blue is for locking in place. The bigger the wheel, the more segments you need.

Could be made into 1 block wide tracks if you replace the signs with text blocks.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 20:51:42 Showing that they do work with text blocks, making them functional 1 block wide tracks. Still impractical tho.
https://streamable.com/v70ign
creations-chat 2022-09-18 20:55:35 Because each section is longer, which makes them not function as well as regular tracks. You also need bigger wheels, as these pretty much won't work with any cylinders smaller than 5 blocks. Technically you could do 3 block wide cylinders, but they would have even worse performance.

Gladly.
creations-chat 2022-09-23 10:43:53 idk bout that, but the yellow colour could maybe be a bit better. Looks a bit too saturated in-game. Wheels look really good btw.
creations-chat 2022-09-23 10:49:00 I got the colour to somewhere between 182,164,92, and 193,171,96 using an image color picker. Not sure if it'll match once in-game though. (without metal material btw, since that makes it darker)
creations-chat 2022-09-23 10:51:07 If you're gonna do metal material you'll have to increase each color by about 20 (i think)
creations-chat 2022-09-23 10:57:19 This is the area i picked the colours from btw.
And this is the website, in case you want to try picking some other areas yourself. The sleeping part of the cab might get you a more yellow version of the colour.
