creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:18:23 Ok tell me how
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:05:38 Yeah, bit hard at that scale tho
creations-chat 2022-05-21 12:50:14 
creations-chat 2022-05-21 12:53:14 Yeah only a bit sharp
creations-chat 2022-05-21 12:55:08 Idrc as long as it flies
creations-chat 2022-05-21 12:57:18 I wasn't complaining about people judging it
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:00:43 Then why did you say it? Cause I appreciate the feedback but I don't wanna get into turbovirgin motorlock, that's what I meant by idrc
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:02:33 I just said I don't want to get better...
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:05:06 Oh my god... I said I appreciate feedback but that I'm not pro enough to fix the damn nose!
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:07:49 Ok next time I'll just look into the future to see what kind of feedback people will give and if I should post it or not
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:10:56 I didn't know what kinda feedback I would get and the feedback I did get was impossible for a noob like me to fix
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:12:38 Don't feel like learning how to fix it tbh, too much work for too little fun
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:15:01 Tbh being a high rank you'd probably be the definition of a discord mod
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:17:21 Nah I just don't wanna learn how to fix my plane
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:19:07 Well you keep on bringing me back here by pinging me so bye ig
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:21:34 Nah I'm just not a fatass who plays roblox all day, but anyways I hope you won't ping me again so I can just go on with my day, adios
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:23:17 Maybe a bit because you're annoying as hell
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:25:39 It looks a bit overweight
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:28:38 Dude, speak for yourself... also don't get salty about downvotes you're probably a 12 yo or some 15 to 25 yo guy who has no friends
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:30:20 Jesus christ, I wasn't salty I was just trying to explain how I am not that good at the goddamn game
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:32:16 Trying to argue with you is like talking to a narcisistic wall
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:34:38 Tell me what I'm being ignorant about?
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:37:02 Oh my... I said about 1 million times already, the nose looks shit yes! Do you understand or is that too much to process?
creations-chat 2022-05-21 13:38:56 Because people keep pinging me the same fucking shit over and over again and I keep feeling the need to reply to them, but hats off to you, I'll go now. For the third time
creations-chat 2022-05-28 07:22:16 Thanks
