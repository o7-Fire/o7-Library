plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:56:01 I have to agree
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:56:26 Pc blocks are huge
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:56:29 For no reason
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:56:54 New players dont know how to use it
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:57:07 + it would be easier to just decrease the size of blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:58:06 Worst part is you get like 4 blocks width for interiors
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 20:58:15 6*
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 21:00:03 The map is to blame
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 21:00:08 Like the turns and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 21:00:10 I think
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 21:00:11 Not aure
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:04:40 Wassup
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:07:07 The blocks are huge and you barely have enough space to put stuff inside, now imagine it with 2 blocks less in width
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:07:29 A human
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:07:50 Wtf is a whitnam
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:09:11 Still will have less space for interior, so bad decission
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:09:37 "alt"
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:11:15 Convert to meter
events-chat 2023-06-20 21:11:46 Were fighting over feet vs meter and the 2 block width on trains
