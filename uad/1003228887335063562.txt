general 2023-02-11 14:08:05 [suggestion]
add in radar equipment, it will allow for more effective homemade missiles and allow for decent anti air, it will also help see enemy's nearby
general 2023-02-11 14:09:07 Dahm

But don't make it perfect, create flaws for it, say, if it exists it's range it will shut down, because shredders might use this as well
general 2023-02-11 14:18:49 It's not working
