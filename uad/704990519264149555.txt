general 2020-11-14 10:10:30 trying to play roblox rn but this zoom meeting consumes all my damn processing power somehow
general 2020-11-14 10:11:52 "Your internet connection is unstable"Yeah, zoom. I know. Shut up with your connection warnings

general 2020-11-14 10:15:55 Ever
general 2020-11-14 10:16:17 But zoom is just often deciding
"haha fuck this guy in particular let's just make the link invalid lolololol"
general 2020-11-14 10:16:45 I mean, I can actually do stuff with Teams on as opposed to Zoom.
general 2020-11-14 10:17:21 And Teams has many integrated features like assignments and meetings and the actual group where we do our lessons and it's saved every time what people say-
general 2020-11-14 10:17:22 lol
