general 2022-12-28 03:13:43 ever just make a tiny fun mech just because you want to get around quickly, while still staying pretty small
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:18:12 i made a tiny mech and someone said it was a tut, cant build anything anymore without people assuming your build is a tut ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:20:34 it walks really well, flying is very stable and has 2 settings on types of flight, legs made to brace heavy impacts and weapons, while still being small and looking cool
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:24:03 yeah its a shame some people cant just appreciate your build no matter where you got the idea from, especially from among us ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:28:50 i sent a pic of my mech i was on about to my mate and he just sent me a ss of this tutorial mech and now i understand why they assumed mine was from a tut it does look pretty similar-ish ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:31:38 it doesn't look identical just has a sort of similar shape, also if you didn't realize that response was the cringiest reply i've seen in a long time and i've seen some cringy replies in the past.
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:33:42 i noticed the sarcasm but it was still cringy
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:36:36 at least someone gets my point
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:39:27 mate among us is shit since when did I agree among us is funny
general 2022-12-28 03:45:15 i swear there used to be a channel where people would post their builds then people would upvote/downvote
general 2022-12-28 03:45:30 or is that just <#384025409945337856> except nobody upvotes/downvotes anymore
general 2022-12-28 03:45:53 what happened to the upvotes/downvotes
general 2022-12-28 03:46:00 people not do that anymore?
general 2022-12-28 03:46:15 i dont see any reactions to the screenshots
general 2022-12-28 03:47:02 i lost hope in the votes ages ago i used to see so many cool builds that would get downvoted lol
