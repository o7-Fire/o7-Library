general 2022-03-11 07:18:35 Eh, not really, seems like you're assuming
general 2022-03-11 07:19:58 And someone producing literal CP is a smaller problem than me bypassing a word?
general 2022-03-11 07:20:04 Damn you are dense
general 2022-03-11 07:20:35 Nope lmao
general 2022-03-11 07:21:43 Then that's crazy, I'll just talk to someone else who has real common sense about actual problems ðŸ’€

general 2022-03-11 07:26:26 Kek, I'm not trying to be a mod, just bringing light to a genuine problem by any means necessary, doesn't matter if the word is bypassed, I'm still gonna use it to describe what I'm trying to convey if it's the right word
general 2022-03-11 07:26:36 Crazy
general 2022-03-11 07:27:04 Then I'll talk to a mod then lmao
