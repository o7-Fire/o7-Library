plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:11:15 Hi!
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:11:36 Is there any update page for Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:13:55 So you do changelog in this discord?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:14:36 They've removed normal pistons and kept the half piston?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:15:18 Oh the prompt didn't load for me lol.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:16:06 Man I wish there was a extended piston.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:16:41 Spent a few hours ago trying to fit something that was ment to be pushed out, with no luck.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:17:30 I'm working with half blocks so it's kinda hard to replace them with 1 x 0.9
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:24:14 Man about those extended pistons, I've tried magnets to pull both the piston and the contraption but it was too heavy.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:25:16 I'm making something where I want guns to come out of the vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:29:04 Isn't ballast something that stabilize ships?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:30:26 I've made a battleship and I accidently clicked save instead of load.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:30:41 Saved over my battleship trying to load it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:30:50 Spent about maybe a day on it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:05:57 The grids are 53 by 53 correct?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:19 Yesterday in my game the rockets sounded like a person. When I tested it again it sounded normal. Was I hearing things?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:37 Oh good.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:10:14 Wait vip you were the one with the giant battleship?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:11:27 I'm building Nelson and Rodney
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:11:49 Oh really?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:12:39 It's a brittish battleship
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:14:50 <@163143541160148992> This is the one I'm making. ðŸ˜ƒ
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:16:34 How did you figure out how to size yours and fit your ship perfectly in your plate?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:20:14 How do you estimate the wideness?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:22:12 One more question, where are the cylinders located in the build menu?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:22:49 https://gyazo.com/5b753ea1db3ad7131a301788a4d0dd86
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:23:11 Yeah I know.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:23:19 It was on vipEmpires
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:23:49 <@163143541160148992> Where are the cylinders?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:31:19 Teach me how to be a master builder. Lol like that would happen.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:31:54 I love to build, I have to say I'm good at it, I'm just not good at sizing things.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:32:21 It's either always too big or always too small
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:33:33 I've made a toilet tank if that's anything. ;~;
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:36:29 I forgot to put the handle back on after trying to add guns into the tank of the toilet.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:36:52 
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:38:04 I have nothing compared to what you've built
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:48:31 Wait they removed giant rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:51:16 https://gyazo.com/92eca673d150776cf254f25e6bb93943
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:51:19 Look at this
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:51:21 no more
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 08:51:27 Big jet engines and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 09:10:56 This by far is the most entertaining thing to me in the game. https://gyazo.com/a61ff407fb9a61f84d6f47c8449dba84

plane-crazy 2018-12-26 06:49:25 nvm
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 06:49:28 I found it
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 08:10:27 I know how to make a train and I can't even build it because the grid is too big.
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 08:14:48 Like seriously I doubt this thing can roll
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 08:15:49 <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:10:00 So far on my battleship
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:10:27 It's based off a ship named the nelson and rodney
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:13:37 Sounds cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:14:17 Honestly same
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:23:01 How do you keep it under water tho?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 09:27:08 And I believe they don't work.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:12:26 What does blast pressure do?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:15:22 You sure?
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 09:29:37 Worlds smallest stunt plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 09:31:02 I doubt any smaller plane can do a barrel roll
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 09:31:17 Prove me wrong.
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 09:31:23 Seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 09:31:39 Prove it. B)
