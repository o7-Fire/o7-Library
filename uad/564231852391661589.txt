<@551806781609869313> custom
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:47:16 Well, the gun isn't in the original position (45 degrees up) so it makes it longer

For the tail, I alr tried disconnectors, half blocks... And it makes it too thick or not thick enough..
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:49:18 Well.. It would add much mass at the back but sure I could try
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:10:06 Well, you can try using mix of sparklers, blocks, cylinders or signs (if you know how to motorlock you can make a custom barrel with special blocks inside of themselves
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:14:43 I have one thing to say : ü™§

plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:19:15 Imagine not being able to build this by ur own
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:20:46 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:21:01 It uses a swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:21:50 But well the issue is that it takes a lot of space for nothing much
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:22:23 Still
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 23:22:50 this type of swashplate also takes a lot of place under the roof

creations-chat 2021-03-26 12:00:52 Well proportions aren't really right, the kirov class is the heaviest battlecruiser ever made yet, a good scaled kirov would take 5 or 6 fold, lot of weapons are missing, the silos are way behind and there's many details missing, in the overall its a good work since the ship is quite hard to make, can be upgrade
creations-chat 2021-03-26 12:03:46 Well, it's honestly a really good Job that u've done yet, maybe try learning decorations skills, or motorlock/cameralock/pistonlock, the overall is still good tbh

creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:18:50 Are you able to read or smth ? <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:20:52 Ayy well done, you read what was written üëè
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:22:53 Honestly or not ?
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:27:50 The carrier texture is too repetitive, the shape's also too squary and stubby, 

there's quite lot of details missing,
 the tower is way too flat, missing details also, there's random jet engines idk why are they here, there's a taxiway missin' (except if your basing it on WW2),

 As i said, quite lot details are missing which makes the ship looking amateur, superstructure also very block, idk about the hull, If i had to judge it i'd say it's a good amateur work, you can still upgrade or learn some detail/decoration skills
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:31:12 ......Well tbh i cant say much cuz you'll learn by getting skills and playing the game, just continue playing the game and you'll understand what i'm talking about

creations-chat 2021-04-07 08:26:40 You should else delete the trails or round the nose shape, it's too Flat and stubby
creations-chat 2021-04-07 08:28:41 Yup! Also try to make the nose else less forward (so move the end backward from 0'5 or 1 block)
Then it should be less sharp

It's a quite too much forward

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 07:52:22 Gold
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 07:52:27 The main issue is about steering
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 07:52:47 once the torpedo starts steering underwater, since its a 1x1 wide, it rotates on itself and start going else up else down
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 07:53:42 I cant really
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 07:53:43 well

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:42:47 Hold, you get that it's a literal shredder right? And you get that it's 3x3 wide right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:45:18 I can't fit a shredder inside
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 08:48:22 8 minutes?

help 2023-07-10 14:01:13 hm sure
help 2023-07-10 14:07:09 By the way dumb question but, did you anyhow use camera lock ?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:15 Alright so your ship is mainly made of custom angle and motorlock right?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:19 Including piston lock?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:36 Alright thank you
help 2023-07-10 14:09:53 I see
help 2023-07-10 14:10:09 So you basically recommend using Custom angle and motorlock
help 2023-07-10 14:10:18 Sorry for asking much question though
help 2023-07-10 14:10:30 Thanks a lot
help 2023-07-10 14:11:02 Also, 27.5 block width is perfect, as it somehow fits the average size of aircrafts ingame
help 2023-07-10 14:11:21 Yup
help 2023-07-10 14:11:24 Thanks for everything
help 2023-07-10 14:12:33 Facing an issue, the lenght
help 2023-07-10 14:12:49 239 block would mean i need about uh.. 5 folds ?
help 2023-07-10 14:12:54 Oh maybe
help 2023-07-10 14:13:00 Now that you say it
help 2023-07-10 14:13:26 So basically
help 2023-07-10 14:13:38 Hm
help 2023-07-10 14:14:07 
help 2023-07-10 14:14:09 As in like this ?
help 2023-07-10 14:15:07 Possibly
help 2023-07-10 14:15:20 I know but
help 2023-07-10 14:15:23 hm
help 2023-07-10 14:15:31 then maybe 0.7 scale
help 2023-07-10 14:16:20 so 167 block long and 19.5 block width
help 2023-07-10 14:16:34 Lemme
help 2023-07-10 14:17:29 Yep
help 2023-07-10 14:17:36 Sounds Do-able in 4 fold ?
help 2023-07-10 14:18:01 167/7=24 so i need 24 1x7 which makes it x4 on plot

help 2023-07-10 14:24:22 üò≠ It's already an angledlock bow on the ship i sent
help 2023-07-10 14:25:23 But yeah i'll do as detailed as i can
help 2023-07-10 14:25:37 If i ever actually get the mindset to make a damn aircraft carrier..
help 2023-07-10 14:26:03 lmao
help 2023-07-10 14:26:05 no.
help 2023-07-10 14:26:07 I could've tho
help 2023-07-10 14:26:48 Whoever tries to make the Kirov damn..
help 2023-07-10 14:32:12 Okay i got this weird question in mind, should i do fold per fold (like i make the whole first fold with details, then the second and so on) or do i make the whole ship in 1
help 2023-07-10 14:34:05 Alright sure, a friend of mine said i should wait for Pc2 release since rumors says that plot bigger and shi, but ehhh
help 2023-07-10 14:34:53 True
