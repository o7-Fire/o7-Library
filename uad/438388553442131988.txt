It didn’t just fall, it’s like it was thrown at the water. It didn’t sink, but there was an invisible barrier at the surface of the water. When i added a rocker engine to it, it flew away a short distance(~character length) and froze. When i got closer, it got a little further every time. Its also now happend to a missile i was making

creations-chat 2021-10-18 20:41:14 feedback on my zeppelin? It has 3 bomb bays(uses all 150 explosive blocks), 1 aa gun and a small biplane
creations-chat 2021-10-18 20:46:29 should I post it in <#384025409945337856> together with a few extra pictures of it?
creations-chat 2021-10-18 20:52:37 thanks everyone
creations-chat 2021-10-18 20:57:57 I have another zeppelin which looks similar. I just finished this airship so it must be the other one unless it was someone else
creations-chat 2021-10-18 21:22:08 Add some camo, remove the blue and pink. With camo I mean mixing in some darker and lighter grey
creations-chat 2021-10-18 21:31:57 Not all zeppelins have those
creations-chat 2021-10-18 21:34:08 Maybe when I make another zeppelin. Theres no more space because of the bomb bays
creations-chat 2021-10-18 21:42:25 3 motors(4 parts)They’re almost a full plot, except for the back. The folds are at the spots with those double lines

Doesn't help that I've never folded/built upside down either
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:37:11 I think I should've posted this in <#478584971670454284>
help 2022-02-28 16:44:27 I'm thinking about making a mistral-class amphibious assault ship. How long, wide and high(hull) should it be? I'm also thinking about putting working vehicles in the garage(front) and hangar(back), so folding upside down isn't really something I'm looking forward to. Doesn't help that I've never folded/built upside down either
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:45:22 Theres a hangar in the front
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:45:36 and that'd also mean I'd have to do a lot more stuff upside down
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:46:06 
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:48:27 do you think I should do upside down folding in the first place?
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:49:28 how many folds tho?
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 16:49:32 4?

events-chat 2022-04-26 14:04:33 Maybe 1 person has to bomb a target at the airfield, while the rest is aa
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:26:51 How about an escort event? 1 team has to escort a slow truck to the airport(or somewhere else) and protect it. The other team has to destroy the target(either by air, navy, or land. Maybe put a cap on it, like 3 land  builds, 2 flying builds, 1 navy build)
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:30:12 hmm, maybe the target can be a very strong build
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:31:05 or the driver/something inside the truck has to be destroyed. It'll have to be something small, so it'll give the defenders time to destroy the enemies. Or there will be multiple trucks
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:32:14 another idea: king of the canyon. 1 team has to make sure no enemies get inside the innovation inc base. Land based units only(unless it's support? Like missiles on a ship, but limit the support units)

general 2022-04-26 19:33:37 wait, old pic?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 19:43:31 what? You mean between the windows?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 19:51:00 I feel like he meant motor lock. You can motor lock wing panels between the windows. If you don't want to motor lock that, you can always put trails on them. It's to make it look like multiple windows instead of one big window
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 20:28:31 yes

general 2022-05-06 11:46:29 I have a nintendo dsi
help 2022-05-09 16:54:38 I'm trying to replace the mini f16's on my carrier with a carrier-based plane. So far I've tried making an f18, f35 and a harrier(kind of), but failed. Any suggestions for an easy to make mini plane(carrier based ofc)?
help 2022-05-09 17:01:05 I tried those already but failed
help 2022-05-09 17:14:26 I‘m trying to do an f18 again
help 2022-05-09 17:34:27 it's too big for the elevator(the blocks below are the same size as the small elevator on my carrier)
help 2022-05-09 17:37:40 it'll have to be the same size as the f16 next to it
help 2022-05-09 17:49:07 Good idea. I’ll have to see about the length tho
help 2022-05-09 17:49:28 The big elevator is 13x13 iirc
help 2022-05-09 17:49:37 But I want it to fit on both
help 2022-05-09 17:50:54 I haven’t done those yet
help 2022-05-09 17:51:26 I’m not sure if they’ll fit tho, so maybe I need to redo it anyways
help 2022-05-09 19:52:18 wip kinda shit mini 18 so far
help 2022-05-09 19:52:36 made with exposed lock
help 2022-05-10 09:18:49 Helium on top, ballast on bottom, pontoons below the water line(1 row on each side), maybe ballast tanks on the level you want the water line to be
help 2022-05-10 21:33:52 I‘m doing an f18 again
help 2022-05-10 21:34:00 Pretty much finished it too
help 2022-05-10 21:34:04 thanks tho
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:22:50 <@456226577798135808> Your armored car is pretty wide. For a next time I‘d try to make it thinner
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:24:47 how are you supposed to improve if you delete everything. Like my builds were any better when I was new.           Make it an odd number next time. Even is harder to work with
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:26:56 Toxicity won‘t help people improve. If anything, it makes people lose motivation
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:29:42 Just ignore them. You can look at my older builds in creations. They were pretty bad and people didn‘t like it either, but I slowly improved
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:32:08 these are some of my oldest builds I have in creations
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:34:15 yeah, I used to do that. I‘m not gonna change it tho, because I liked it back then, so I upvoted it. Also, I was pretty bad at the game back then. You can shit on it all you want, I don‘t like them anymore anyways cuz they‘re old and bad
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:37:45 maybe that should be changed. How is the game supposed to grow if ‘pros‘ keep bullying new people which makes them stop playing
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:39:49 not a good thing for a community tho. It won‘t grow as fast/shrink, making the devs less motivated to update which might result in the game dying faster. Or it won‘t, idk
creations-chat 2022-05-11 23:18:56 hello rbk     go to <#497142796961054721> rq

general 2022-05-12 16:56:58 Will it also be paid access?
creations-chat 2022-05-12 21:02:09 looks better now
creations-chat 2022-05-12 21:04:16 Eh, I‘d say just keep improving and setting your own standard higher each time. Also start with very simple motor lock and gradually make it more complex.   Oops, pings was on which makes it seem this message is directed towards you lol

general 2022-05-14 12:13:05 Big builds + a ton of motorlock= pain

creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:49:51 yeah, pretty toxic community

creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:13:54 nope, the holes on the ship is just interior space. The autocannon things are actually more like ciws, but I didn’t want that many ciws on it

creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:32:37 I'd build a new ship instead, because I assume you've improved since then? Take a look at some other ships people have made and take inspiration from that. That's something I still do

general 2022-07-14 15:29:09 do you want to play a minigame I’m working on(which should almost be done)
general 2022-07-14 15:29:50 didn’t really have an option when I got it
general 2022-07-14 15:30:09 didn’t have my own pc. I do now, kinda. I have a laptop, but it’s pretty potato

general 2022-07-14 15:32:03 bedrock is better for playing with friends
general 2022-07-14 15:32:18 not that I have friends tho💀
general 2022-07-14 15:33:25 I used to play the demo when I was a kid
general 2022-07-14 15:34:15 for some reason I thought removing all the blocks(it was an old world) would somehow spawn a pyramid and animals(there were no mobs). I was a weird kid
general 2022-07-14 15:35:11 anyways, my minigame is inspired by the vr game ‘panoptic’ except it’s shit and kinda low effort bcuz nobody really plays my minigames anyways
general 2022-07-14 15:35:40 imagine mojang gave away bedrock for free when purchasing java, but not the other way around

general 2022-08-18 16:48:19 it'd be pretty neat if I could somehow use my Ipad to add extra (custom) buttons to my laptop lol
general 2022-08-18 17:12:25 <@527092191189925918> I think I'm gonna piston lock trapdoors .1 block down so their texture doesn't overlap with the edge of the hatch. I can now make it so each one opens individually. Should I do that or still make them open in pairs of 2?
general 2022-08-18 17:12:41 the first option won't add any extra keybinds
creations-chat 2022-08-18 17:50:05 should the edges of the hatches be a default material and just have a darker color?  <@491272361589342208> yeah, they work. 20 guided missiles

creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:54:39 Should I keep the yellow outline and just fill it in a different way? Something like this: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/995338370295267378
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:01:11 damn boi, he thicc
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:28:47 Doing a hull like my latest boat is pretty hard on this hull, because the vertical slope is 1x1 wedges, while the horizontal slope is 1x2, 1x3, 1x3, 1x4, 1x4. So how does this hull look?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:31:30 hm, angle locking a hull doesn't seem like a good option either, because 1. I haven't done it before and 2. It's not a pointy hull, it's rounded. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I should do the hull?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:35:52 you mean like this?https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1012081057107021854

creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:01:38 I mean, I can make a smooth hull, but I've never done it like this. Usually my hulls are 1x2 wedges going down, but this hull has 1x1 wedges, making it steeper. Idk, I just find it a little harder to do. Also, I'm trying to think of other ways to do the hull
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:04:27 I thought of trying that too, but I'm not sure if the would even work, because the hull is rounded and not pointy. I'll try angle lock now tho

<@359613171495075842> did you have a pointy or a rounded front?

<@767800077837926431> I'm not sure what you mean, could you send an example?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:12:10 I meant the shape from above

general 2022-10-08 07:43:41 Dyno bot be like:

If (word== “bad word”.”bad word”.”bad word” etc {
Delete “bad word”;
Print (“$user has been warned”);
}

This code won’t work, but I thought it was funny
general 2022-10-08 07:45:01 I thought editing wasn’t allowed, but do shaders not count as editing?

plane-crazy 2022-10-08 09:12:13 I tried with the top pic. I’ll try again tho, but maybe I can get the sun behind the carrier so it’ll look like this(also one of my ships)
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 09:28:14 what?

My suggestion is that you paint the propeller a black/dark grey color, make the back not square, add some decals and add details.
