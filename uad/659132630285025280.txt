general 2021-01-03 05:35:12 any applications on your computer
general 2021-01-03 05:35:23 can be put into discord's game activity
general 2021-01-03 05:37:29 any application on your computer can be put into discord's game activity menu, you can also rename those apps to whatever you want. Discord (at least on ym computer) can be added to the game activity menu, and i rename it all the time. That's how i do it.
