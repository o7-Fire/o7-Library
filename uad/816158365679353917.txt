plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:06:56 Can someone teach me how to build things and make them fly
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:09:19 but how do people create those big builds that look so cool and can fly real well
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:09:26 like they are real mechanics or something
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:09:40 how?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:10:13 I looked them up but they were mainly tutorials on a particular plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:10:22 instead of ones about the motors and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:11:06 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:12:00 But I have a huge problem with trying to perfect things and when I dont like it I just quit the game and its like some sort of OCD problem
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:13:06 Okay
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 04:13:09 thank you
