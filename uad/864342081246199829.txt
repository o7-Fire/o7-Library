plane-crazy 2022-03-21 21:17:03 hey guys quick question
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 21:20:28 quick question, im making a huge ground vehicle and google says that having smaller front wheels makes it turn easier? would that work?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 21:23:00 oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 21:23:23 so larger front wheels let it handle impact better appearently
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 21:39:50 are friction blocks weaker than regular blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:08:22 whats the point of ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:09:31 so I just use them to add extra weight to stuff?

bot-central 2022-03-24 20:19:23 &suggestion Make it so as you reach higher altitude, gravity slowly lowers, wings become less effective, and helum blocks become less effective.
