creations-chat 2021-01-31 02:19:26 
creations-chat 2021-01-31 02:22:01 :(
creations-chat 2021-01-31 21:35:52 That is a very great technique for a frame, dude.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 21:38:14 I might have to use it. If that's okay. <@!707255933201416304>
creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:02:57 I just want to use your frame on the canopy. I don't want to copy your whole helicopter, that is rude and annoying from experience. I won't copy the whole build.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:05:40 Yeah
general 2021-01-31 22:07:21 <@!707255933201416304>
general 2021-01-31 22:07:24 This
general 2021-01-31 22:08:11 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-22 18:31:19 My creation role go brr because I posted a picture that was supposed to go in regular plane crazy
general 2021-07-18 10:35:34 What is the new map thing from <#529858892075761694> ? I‚Äôve been away from plane crazy for a long time
general 2021-07-18 10:36:24 Sob
general 2021-09-08 20:35:57 Why am I not able to see anything in <#384025409945337856>? I think a long time ago I posted a wip in creations and then I got muted from the channel.
general 2021-09-08 20:36:29 I got creations blacklist
general 2021-09-08 20:37:30 I posted a wip in <#384025409945337856>
general 2021-09-08 20:37:35 This was like 6 months ago
general 2021-09-08 20:38:16 It was a wip of a paper airplane in plane crazy
general 2021-09-08 20:38:39 I don‚Äôt even know who did it. It was such a long time ago
general 2021-09-08 20:39:31 I don‚Äôt even know who did it
creations-chat 2021-11-06 08:01:01 Very sick
creations-chat 2022-04-07 20:27:46 The real cow üò°
creations-chat 2022-04-07 20:29:47 That... that‚Äôs a pretty stupid cow
general 2022-04-23 00:46:07 What happened to pc2
creations-chat 2022-07-06 20:33:20 Looks like German, only the Englisch word
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:33:45 Because radars from fhe ground view won‚Äôt be able to see the engine
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:38:32 Does not look cool. Practical, but nicht cool
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:42:45 What is a normal design though? There are thousands of unique airplanes in the world. Also, it might just be the 4th generation in me but afterburner looks cool, now I must wait 2 more minutes before I can respond
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:45:04 What is an every day nozzle? Nozzles are different on each plane, unless they use the same nozzle. As well as different engines and different types of engines and certain requirements for those
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:48:02 Firstly, the program that produced both of those aircraft made the requirement of the usage of that nozzle and engine and the parameters they have, neither of those planes copied one or the other. Also, nozzles look different regardless if they‚Äôre circular
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:50:45 So it was a coincidence that both aircraft used the same engine that was built for the thrust vectoring nozzle out of the billions of engines in the world?
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:53:39 Competitions have strict guidelines and parameters that must be followed. Best at the time, for stealth aircraft only? Do you see what I mean?
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:56:36 Nice spelling
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:59:09 The argument was ‚Äúthe f23 engine looks cool‚Äù and then you took it into why the engines on the raptor and black widow were the same
creations-chat 2022-12-18 07:02:41 Yeah my bad I said that wrong, anyway good chat I need sleep now
creations-chat 2022-12-18 22:36:49 What is that sound ID? Never mind I found it
