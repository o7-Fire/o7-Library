help 2022-08-31 21:47:37 So I've had this tiger tank for a while now and it never really worked properly, I tried re-watching the tutorial I used and there werent any mistakes
help 2022-08-31 21:47:50 The entire issue is that instead of moving forwards and backwards, it jumps up and down
help 2022-08-31 21:48:02 I believe it has something to do with the suspension but nothing I've done has fixed it
help 2022-08-31 21:48:06
