general 2020-10-04 04:38:56 when are they going to add a block scaling tool

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:21:19 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:21:29 you cant even roll or do 180s mid air
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:21:41 how are you suppose to dog fight
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:22:50 you can?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:23:57 dunno where your wing flaps
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:24:12 but it's mostly for you to figure out
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:25:30 the flaps on the side i assign them to A and D cause thats what I like
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:25:49 the back ones to q and e
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:25:54 and that top one I dont know
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:26:58 I actually don't know how you would pitch down or up exactly you might need to add more faps to the side or back
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:27:33 faps <:naalewd:486634466568306688>
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:28:23 it'd make it more smaller but you'd porb need to redesign the thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:28:37 since it turns blocks into half blocks or something like that
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:30:36 well you can use motors and add wing panels to it
