general 2022-11-08 14:07:37 crap
general 2022-11-08 14:07:37 someone posted a short on videos
general 2022-11-08 17:59:55 and they're updating again
general 2022-11-08 18:15:15 plane crazy is having a fun day
general 2022-11-08 18:43:31 they need to add missiles that actually can guide themselves to a target
general 2022-11-08 18:43:40 and put them in specific servers for dogfights
general 2022-11-08 18:43:43 that would be cool
general 2022-11-08 18:43:58 yeah
general 2022-11-08 18:44:18 i know, but it would be cool if a missile like that could exist in the building system
general 2022-11-08 18:44:25 it would take up less space on a jet
general 2022-11-08 18:44:33 y'know what i mean?
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:24:53 i posted a random picture of a jet i made and i noticed how it gets lot's of dislikes
it's like nothing deserves an upvote unless it looks like it was made by someone who doesn't have a life and has never been outside for 26 days
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:30:41 yeah i know the rating is good, but i'm still wondering why a lot of people think that builds that aren't the best of the best are just bad
it's just a little confusing, not annoying
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:33:56 yeah lol
creations-chat 2022-11-09 20:11:44 that makes a lot of sense, i completely understand
thank you
creations-chat 2022-11-11 03:39:10 here's a cockpit i'm working on for a futuristic supersonic jet or something

general 2022-11-12 19:29:29 lol
general 2022-11-22 20:18:47 i don't think i would be on this discord server or have a channel if i was 12
if you don't like how i sound, that's completely fine
general 2022-11-22 20:19:35 yeah i'm on the younger side of the community i guess you could say

general 2022-11-26 01:20:51 i tried spin lock on the front of a plane i don't know if this is awesome or absolutely trash
creations-chat 2022-11-26 16:02:22 working on a plane, any suggestions on it?
general 2022-11-28 00:00:26 hey, question anyone
can i use my build twice for two rank categories? (e.g. a boat giving someone the shipwright engineer rank and designer rank)
general 2022-11-29 22:15:05 not correct, i don't think the word "crap" is swearing
some other people might think of those words as minor swears, so for the rules in my server for example, i clarified that they are okay
general 2022-11-29 22:15:56 i'm supposed to ignore notifications?
general 2022-11-29 22:16:41 i was reading the general area
general 2022-11-29 22:17:40 <@402617794606399488> you don't have to actively hate my channel, you can just ignore it and move along
this community should be open to anyone who wants to make content on it
general 2022-11-29 22:18:53 is saying my content is awful and not saying anything else criticism?
general 2022-11-29 22:19:13 please do
general 2022-11-29 22:19:42 okay, that's completely fine
general 2022-11-29 22:20:48 if i was 12, i would not be on the server, nor would i have a channel
general 2022-11-29 22:21:44 i come here everyday and read the chat
general 2022-11-29 22:21:54 for example?
general 2022-11-29 22:22:19 like a rating your builds sort of thing?
general 2022-11-29 22:22:41 look
general 2022-11-29 22:22:48 i'm not  going to be coming up with original ideas all the time
general 2022-11-29 22:24:17 i have other stuff on my shoulders and i have the time to produce new ideas and content every week
youtube is a passion, not a career

also <@799578285377060865> i'm really anxious over something else right now and responding to negative feedback isn't the most positive force so sorry if i can't spot every single tiny little joke you make
general 2022-11-29 22:25:07 i'm not denying that, that's true
general 2022-11-29 22:25:14 i'm being overly sensitive right now
general 2022-11-29 22:30:12 dude what's wrong with writing a reply that's more than 75 characters
general 2022-11-29 22:36:35

general 2022-11-29 22:44:38 well
general 2022-11-29 22:45:10 i've never really gotten criticism before so i didn't really know how to handle it
general 2022-11-29 22:45:23 what the hell
general 2022-11-29 22:45:48 yeah
general 2022-11-29 22:46:02 well
general 2022-11-29 22:46:20 saying i've never gotten criticism wasn't really the right thing to say
general 2022-11-29 22:46:25 more of i never really payed attention to it
general 2022-11-29 22:46:53 yeah i'm gonna try and not get hit as hard as i did just now
general 2022-11-29 22:47:24 yeah, i completely understand what you mean

general 2022-12-01 20:59:36 probably
general 2022-12-01 20:59:48 i don't want it to accidently blow up and steal players from plane crazy if i add more features
general 2022-12-01 21:00:09 i'll have a plane crazy popup that takes up 99% of the screen on the x and y axis
general 2022-12-01 21:00:29 eh moderate

general 2022-12-01 21:03:51 i plan on making the map an island with more smaller islands off coast
general 2022-12-01 21:04:16 also no realistic water cause i don't know how to test it without my pc exploding since roblox studio uses your pc as a server when testing
general 2022-12-01 21:04:44 lol
general 2022-12-01 21:04:59 i swear if he plans a release date for this weekend and cancels it just to freak me out

*in my knockoff
general 2022-12-01 23:03:51 i know
general 2022-12-01 23:03:57 my air foil system sucks right now
general 2022-12-01 23:04:03 i need to improve the rocket engine physics
general 2022-12-01 23:04:27 oohhh yeah
general 2022-12-01 23:04:35 whenever the plane hits a small groove in the ground, it goes kaboom
general 2022-12-01 23:04:44 kaboom meaning spinning 9999 degrees per second
general 2022-12-01 23:28:26 holy crap i am suffering from burnout lol
general 2022-12-01 23:28:34 working on plane crazy knockoff

general 2022-12-02 00:24:44 yes
general 2022-12-02 00:24:48 no

general 2022-12-02 00:24:58 well uh
general 2022-12-02 00:25:02 this is part one of the video
general 2022-12-02 00:25:15 the only thing i need to add left is the flying system
general 2022-12-02 00:25:20 then it's basically plane crazy
general 2022-12-02 00:25:29 then i maybe add motors after thhat 😳
general 2022-12-02 00:49:00 plane crazy general when new person:

general 2022-12-02 00:49:58 i joined this server a while ago and some random dude called me a whitename
general 2022-12-02 00:50:14 i guess that makes sense, but i already had the idea in my mind of  getting a few ranks and i checked for qualifications lol
general 2022-12-02 00:50:24 hmm
general 2022-12-02 00:50:40 those small drone ship thingies from avatar by james cameron
general 2022-12-02 00:52:23 best example of what i could find
general 2022-12-02 00:52:32 kind of a body like that and two giant props on either side
general 2022-12-02 00:59:32 yes that was the entire idea of the build
general 2022-12-02 00:59:36 the avatar reference
general 2022-12-02 01:00:26 i know some chinese but i didn't know what your bio read
general 2022-12-02 01:00:39 but then i saw "chilli sauce" in the jumbled mess of characters
general 2022-12-02 01:00:40 and then i knew

general 2022-12-02 01:02:07 would anyone like rate my thumbnail out of 10
general 2022-12-02 01:02:21 
general 2022-12-02 01:02:24 how is it?
general 2022-12-02 01:02:31 thanks
general 2022-12-02 01:02:34 any suggestions for it?
general 2022-12-02 01:03:13 okay okay thanks
general 2022-12-02 01:03:42 anything else you want to say about it?
general 2022-12-02 01:03:51 or are you gonna take away 8.5 points over a lack of design
general 2022-12-02 01:04:00 that wouldn't be noticeable if i changed it lol
general 2022-12-02 01:04:11 i mean i respect your opinion, i just think the change won't matter
general 2022-12-02 01:05:28 i'll try that out, thank you!
general 2022-12-02 01:05:40 i'll use normal plane crazy to make a small plane
general 2022-12-02 01:06:15 i suck at modeling 💀
general 2022-12-02 01:08:25 but i completely see what you mean. the image of the normal tutorial plane hints that "plane crazy 2" will not have changed much and that would be a problem
general 2022-12-02 01:10:04 i know this kinda sucks but i'm running out of time
general 2022-12-02 01:10:12 would it be at least a bit more acceptable?
general 2022-12-02 01:10:19 
general 2022-12-02 01:10:45 yeah?
general 2022-12-02 01:10:54 okay
general 2022-12-02 01:10:57 look at this
general 2022-12-02 01:10:59 i think this is all you need
general 2022-12-02 01:11:39 
general 2022-12-02 01:11:51 take a motor and place it near the bottom of the superstructure
general 2022-12-02 01:12:01 then count up the distance between the motor and the bottom of your ship
general 2022-12-02 01:12:09 and then that will be the floor for the top of your ship
general 2022-12-02 01:12:49 well i don't know what to do, sorry
general 2022-12-02 01:13:00 do you have a suggestion for what type of aircraft i should use?

general 2022-12-02 01:22:53 i will update it to something better later

general 2022-12-24 02:20:52 bruh lol
general 2022-12-24 02:21:50 every tweet from roblox i see, it's full of a whole bunch of 10 year olds asking for roblox to fix their account when you can literally email roblox with a guaranteed reply
general 2022-12-24 02:21:57 not complaining, but it's really funny
general 2022-12-24 02:22:17 i've taken a break from it since my last video

am i allowed to post old videos i made a year ago to <#537387160261885962> that i haven't posted there yet?
creations-chat 2022-12-24 19:24:13 i made a boat that is an odd number of blocks wide but has a pointy front
i'm really surprised not a lot of people do this
creations-chat 2022-12-24 20:06:34 he used some angle lock and cylinders
you can search it up on youtube
creations-chat 2022-12-24 20:39:42 pro ship hull
*the boat is an odd number of blocks wide, i used some motorlock to make it look like it wasn't

general 2023-01-10 22:28:41 making the best models for my AAA high quality game with 25 developers
general 2023-01-10 22:29:22 😭 my server does suck real 😭
general 2023-01-10 22:30:09 why can't you just accept the fact that you cant swear
general 2023-01-10 22:30:15 i don't get it lol
general 2023-01-10 22:30:38 no that's not my point
general 2023-01-10 22:30:46 my point is you guys can handle not swearing in a server
general 2023-01-10 22:32:06 because the base of the motors dont connect
general 2023-01-10 22:32:11 you need to let the bases connect
general 2023-01-10 22:32:21 here is what motorlock looks like in the game sorry
general 2023-01-10 22:32:36 
general 2023-01-10 22:32:49 so you see uh
general 2023-01-10 22:32:56 plane crazy has an issue where motors can connect from the sides
general 2023-01-10 22:33:00 which technically doesnt make sense
general 2023-01-10 22:33:06 my game is just more simplistic with the welding
general 2023-01-10 22:33:28 bro look
general 2023-01-10 22:33:30 this is what logic is
general 2023-01-10 22:33:53 
general 2023-01-10 22:33:56 those dont conect!!!!!!!
general 2023-01-10 22:34:44 all of that for not having the same motorlock as plane crazy lmao
general 2023-01-10 22:35:29 the game is literally 4 days old in early alpha
general 2023-01-10 22:35:44 why do you expect so much for a game thats only been developed for a month
general 2023-01-10 22:37:20 for god sake the game is a month old cut it some slack
general 2023-01-10 22:42:31 they're only using 10% of their power
general 2023-01-10 22:57:53 that one moment where you're listening on full volume with headphones and then an ad plays at 250% volume
general 2023-01-10 23:00:21 in 2025, phones are gonna project a 3d ad 2 feet in front of you

general 2023-01-11 21:52:08 well that's my plan
general 2023-01-11 21:52:19 my idea was to make something similar to plane crazy
general 2023-01-11 21:52:26 then slowly grow away from it and make something more original
general 2023-01-11 21:52:37 but the building system probably won't change that much
general 2023-01-11 21:52:45 i'm actually really confused on what i should do lol
general 2023-01-11 21:53:07 thats what ive been doing
general 2023-01-11 21:53:14 hmm
general 2023-01-11 22:00:30 okay i thought about it
general 2023-01-11 22:00:43 i think removing the grid system in flightpoint is a good idea
general 2023-01-11 22:00:50 it lets people make better builds
general 2023-01-11 22:00:56 but it would take a lot of change in code

general 2023-01-13 00:40:39 just doing what i want to do as long as i have fun
general 2023-01-13 00:40:41 that's my mind set
general 2023-01-13 00:41:22 roblox knockoff kinda
https://www.roblox.com/games/11003699655/Chiseled-Cheese-Sandbox
general 2023-01-13 00:41:31 you can put together little maps like obbies
general 2023-01-13 00:41:34 and then save them
general 2023-01-13 00:41:42 and you can also see other players' creations
general 2023-01-13 00:43:04 those are different builds other players have made
general 2023-01-13 00:43:16 the cats are just random placeholder thumbnails
general 2023-01-13 00:43:20 so the game has a build mode and view mode
general 2023-01-13 00:43:35 build mode is for editing the maps, and anyone else who plays them are put in view mode
general 2023-01-13 00:43:54 yeah its more like roblox studio than plane crazy
general 2023-01-13 00:44:24 the block will appear on top of the nearest surface to your camera <@297120728342331392>
general 2023-01-13 00:47:04 you need to click it and wait a few milliseconds before dragging it
general 2023-01-13 00:47:29 the position and orientation cant be altered
general 2023-01-13 00:47:32 you have to use topbar tool
general 2023-01-13 01:00:52 some dude made a jet in my game and i think its going a little fast

general 2023-01-14 04:59:38 motorlock towers do exist though lol
but you cant use disconnectors to delay them though
general 2023-01-14 05:00:05 my goal is when pc2 comes out, my game will be unique enough to maybe even maintain a playerbase
general 2023-01-14 05:00:12 if a playerbase counts as 5 concurrent players lmao
general 2023-01-14 05:00:59 omg yessss

general 2023-01-16 03:25:45 roblox needs to add a toggle for that
general 2023-01-16 03:29:16 roblox has no failsafe for loops without wait times
general 2023-01-16 03:29:21 well i guess it does eventually force stop it
general 2023-01-16 03:29:27 but roblox should give better method

general 2023-01-18 23:39:56 did someone just mention flightpoint
general 2023-01-18 23:40:11 the game that has made me get mental breakdowns every time i make devlog
general 2023-01-18 23:53:21 that's literally the other reason why i have mental breakdowns about it lmao
general 2023-01-18 23:53:48 i mean i can make them three blocks but i dont know why i havent yet
general 2023-01-18 23:54:15 also i think the hitboxes being weird stuff is just because the expectation of flightpoint is to be plane crazy
general 2023-01-18 23:54:23 when i want to distance it from plane crazy
general 2023-01-19 00:37:30 oh no
general 2023-01-19 00:46:32 thats the point of the game
general 2023-01-19 00:46:39 to copy plane crazy
general 2023-01-19 00:46:41 lmao
general 2023-01-19 00:46:45 i am growing away from that anyway
general 2023-01-19 00:47:19 yeah and thats what im working on
general 2023-01-19 00:47:23 but i dont do gamedev all the time
general 2023-01-19 20:16:29 adding a config option to flightpoint motors to allow them to behave like plane crazy motors hitbox wise
general 2023-01-19 20:17:42 dang
general 2023-01-19 20:17:43 okay
general 2023-01-19 20:17:56 also motorlock in my game is set with cframe which means you cant use anything to temporarily stop it
general 2023-01-19 20:18:16 but i'll change up the way it locks with physics so it can be temporarily stopped with disconnectors or the disappearing block or something
general 2023-01-19 20:18:23 later tho
general 2023-01-19 20:24:51 something aint right

creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:07:47 working on a jet
*based off of f-15 and f-5
not done yet lmao*
any suggestions?

also the rocket engines are just placeholders
creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:13:48 lmao
its inspired by f-15 though
and i gave it a nose and middle fuselage more like the f-5
creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:16:57 hi again lol
i kind of dropped this idea cause theres almost no space
i'm still occasionally  trying to add it
creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:56:57 made this smooth it looks awesome
creations-chat 2023-01-20 18:04:36 edit: i think the jet is acceptable if you think of it as unique
*like f-35 <:trollface:775024642104229898>*
creations-chat 2023-01-20 18:37:54 thanks
adding in tails and im suffering lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-20 18:59:11 pvp <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-01-20 19:03:14 yeah
creations-chat 2023-01-20 21:25:23 its one of my first jets calm down lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-20 21:44:16 you got damn high expectations and only like certain builds that are just perfect
incase you didn't know, i'm a human
creations-chat 2023-01-20 21:46:52 you just contradicted yourself lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-20 21:54:12 your version of good is blender mesh quality. can't you just accept builds from people that don't play plane crazy 14 hours a day?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 21:57:45 i'm just trying to say you don't go from absolute wreck to mesh perfection in just a month
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 21:59:34 lies

plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:01:43 what does that have to do with anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:02:53 sure that doesnt mean we all do
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:03:09 probably is
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:03:12 but i've never tried before
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:03:18 and i'm making good progress i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:03:26 my last jet looked like a goof-22
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:04:17 <@883063424614006878> at least this
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:04:41 is better than this

plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:05:09 nah i think that would ruin it
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:05:16 i tried to make it as small as possible for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:05:20 but i'll go bigger for my next one
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:05:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:05:32 this is only my 4-5th ever motorlocked jet since 2020
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:06:00 now i guess i understand why you have high expectations according to me
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:06:33 but honestly thanks for the feedback
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 22:06:42 i'll make it a goal to get better
creations-chat 2023-01-20 22:17:51 thanks i understand
i'm still early with jets and to me, i think where i'm at is impressive for myself
i'm getting better with every jet i make and the next one will probably not be 1 wide

general 2023-01-23 02:11:28 *worse lag machines and map breaking glitches when*
general 2023-01-23 02:11:35 ngl i might make infinite plots
general 2023-01-23 02:11:41 but then it would go into a single player world
general 2023-01-23 02:11:52 and the limited plots would go for multiplayer servers
general 2023-01-23 02:12:40 all this stuff breaks my brain
general 2023-01-23 02:12:53 i'm surprised i even was able to press "Create game"
general 2023-01-23 02:13:52 <@297120728342331392> i am slowly increasing plot size as more updates roll out though
general 2023-01-23 02:14:13 okay
general 2023-01-23 02:14:19 the triangle system is my alternative to motorlock
general 2023-01-23 02:14:33 but motorlock will probably still exist
general 2023-01-23 02:14:37 still working on it though
general 2023-01-23 02:14:40 sure
general 2023-01-23 02:14:52 right now there's only a triangle tool
general 2023-01-23 02:15:19 ngl yeah
general 2023-01-23 02:15:28 thats why i was hesitating on making motorlock in my game
general 2023-01-23 02:18:16 the badge was obtainable for a week
general 2023-01-23 02:18:41 you think i should enable it again?
general 2023-01-23 02:18:53 okay good point
general 2023-01-23 02:18:56 i should probably re-enable it
general 2023-01-23 02:20:04 give it to me in dms or something cause general is messy

general 2023-01-23 17:26:08 its better to use just as a studio plugin

general 2023-01-23 18:54:20 yeah
general 2023-01-23 18:54:23 it takes time to learn and do
general 2023-01-23 18:54:31 but i think its way less complicated than motorlock
general 2023-01-23 18:54:39 good question
general 2023-01-23 18:54:44 yes, but when i update the game <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2023-01-23 21:43:54 
general 2023-01-23 21:44:13 oh okay
general 2023-01-23 21:45:11 i'm not saying they're bad
general 2023-01-23 21:46:05 but plane crazy is limited though
general 2023-01-23 21:46:11 all you have is motorlock and some plane parts
general 2023-01-23 21:46:34 so if you were to take a good plane crazy build and put it into some random game outside of roblox, it wouldn't be called good
general 2023-01-23 21:46:41 yeah
general 2023-01-23 21:46:49 but each game style is different
general 2023-01-23 21:47:05 and builds in one game will look out of place a little bit
general 2023-01-23 21:47:09 you get what i mean though?
general 2023-01-23 21:47:33 he's not done with it yet
general 2023-01-23 21:47:54 lmao
general 2023-01-23 21:48:00 i agree it looks meh
general 2023-01-23 21:48:16 i'm just pointing out the difference of the game plane crazy
general 2023-01-23 21:50:09 oh wait
general 2023-01-23 21:50:28 also its his first build in the game
general 2023-01-23 21:50:31 i dont think my game is becoming f3x
general 2023-01-23 21:50:37 its plane crazy but different
general 2023-01-23 21:50:57 i also hate f3x building games
general 2023-01-23 21:51:01 my game has nothing to do with f3x
general 2023-01-23 21:51:04 i coded everything on my own
general 2023-01-23 21:51:09 and a little help of devforum
general 2023-01-23 21:51:26 the triangle drawer system isnt f3x its a complete different concept
general 2023-01-23 21:51:42 i understand
general 2023-01-23 21:51:50 i'm trying to say i dont understand why you guys think it is f3x
general 2023-01-23 21:51:54 theres literally no similar features
general 2023-01-23 21:52:21 you can resize blocks in my game
general 2023-01-23 21:52:28 the entire polygon looking thing is a triangle drawing system
general 2023-01-23 21:52:51 probably
general 2023-01-23 21:53:00 they should allow you to play the old version
general 2023-01-23 21:53:30 yeah
general 2023-01-23 21:53:49 <@527653676022628353> have you even played flightpoint with the triangle drawer?
general 2023-01-23 21:54:03 describe the similarity then
general 2023-01-23 21:54:29 damn people here are hard to talk to lmao
general 2023-01-23 21:56:01 <@527653676022628353> also let me guess the game is only bad cause it doesnt give the exact same building technique as plane crazy
general 2023-01-23 21:56:25 at this point does rick even code?
general 2023-01-23 21:56:46 look at plane crazy
general 2023-01-23 21:56:48 there are so many bugs
general 2023-01-23 21:56:55 plane crazy is basic
general 2023-01-23 21:56:57 to tell the truth
general 2023-01-23 21:57:00 it has a 2015 style
general 2023-01-23 21:57:23 you're also comparing a game made in 2022 with one made in 2014
general 2023-01-23 21:57:37 of course my game is still basic
general 2023-01-23 21:58:12 if you compare my game with what rick got in 2014, my game is already better when it comes the map, features and other stuff
general 2023-01-23 21:58:40 damn you cant even give a reason why it is like  f3x
general 2023-01-23 21:58:50 AND THAT'S WHAT
general 2023-01-23 21:58:52 PLANE CRAZY IS
general 2023-01-23 21:58:56 LOL
general 2023-01-23 22:01:13 i'm not trying to make fun of you or mess with you
general 2023-01-23 22:01:17 my  game has nothing to do with f3x
general 2023-01-23 22:01:29 or you're just complimenting it cause the building system is more advanced like f3x lmao
general 2023-01-23 22:01:40 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-23 22:02:41 at least i can program in 3 different languages

general 2023-01-23 22:04:33 “thats crazy” <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-23 22:07:52 with my experience, roblox built in handles suck, and so do custom ones
general 2023-01-23 22:08:21 probably why rick didnt do the click and drag build moving
general 2023-01-23 22:10:22 yep

I run and jump, it's so much fun
I play Fortnite, it's second to none

Verse 2:
I dance and emote, it's so silly
I play with friends, it's so thrilling
I win some games, and I lose some too
But I always play, cause it's what I do

Chorus:
Fortnite, Fortnite, my favorite game
I play it all day, it's never a shame
I run and jump, it's so much fun
I play Fortnite, it's second to none

Outro:
I love Fortnite, it's the best
I play it all day, I never rest
I'll play it forever, it's so much fun
I love Fortnite, it's second to none.

general 2023-02-05 23:04:18 its kind of cursed
general 2023-02-05 23:04:30 thats why i made block stacking (placing them inside each other)
general 2023-02-05 23:04:33 and the triangle drawer
general 2023-02-05 23:04:34 makes up for it
general 2023-02-05 23:04:43 also next update, block stack limit is increased to 15
general 2023-02-05 23:07:16 keep in mind though
general 2023-02-05 23:07:20 you can stack blocks at the same orientation

general 2023-02-11 03:05:12 okay cause people say they get used to the building system quick <@636996526878490624>
general 2023-02-11 03:05:20 and they'd prefer it over plane crazy
general 2023-02-11 03:05:25 idk just an opinion in the game
general 2023-02-11 03:05:37 the only times ive used the games building system is to test and make sure its working
general 2023-02-11 03:05:38 lol

general 2023-02-11 03:12:55 well i dont really know till i re-release the game
general 2023-02-11 03:16:47 two thousand and googelplex
general 2023-02-11 03:55:54 dude got a working canopy going tf
general 2023-02-11 04:22:55 flightpoint
general 2023-02-11 04:23:02 its staying friends only for the next 10 hours
general 2023-02-11 04:23:20 kk
general 2023-02-11 04:23:23 there is a ban system
general 2023-02-11 04:23:54 that entire thing was threatened
general 2023-02-11 04:24:02 no matter what
general 2023-02-11 04:24:05 taking the game down was a good idea
general 2023-02-11 04:24:11 because it was vulnerable no matter what
general 2023-02-11 04:24:40 remote vulnerabilities
general 2023-02-11 04:24:48 the client would process to much data and send it to the server
general 2023-02-11 04:24:53 when the exploiters could edit that data before sending
general 2023-02-11 04:24:59 now the server would process that data
general 2023-02-11 04:25:06 and the client sends less info that can be exploitable
general 2023-02-11 04:25:09 basically the main idea
general 2023-02-11 04:34:07 oh damn
general 2023-02-11 04:34:08 idk dude
general 2023-02-11 04:34:11 i need to get out of the negatives

general 2023-02-11 07:09:31 this dude still needed motorlock
general 2023-02-11 07:09:52 plane crazy probably uses the method filterstringforbroadcast() which hasnt been updated for a while
general 2023-02-11 07:10:03 so that stuff is outdated and probably uses <13 filter method
general 2023-02-11 07:20:23 though thee must art thou tho them is just one of many techniques to conqueror my insanity

general 2023-02-13 01:40:46 what happened
general 2023-02-13 01:41:01 this is serious i was watching a youtube video
general 2023-02-13 01:41:15 i will not be so rudely interrupted by such a ping
general 2023-02-13 01:41:46 im cancel you all on twitter!!!!!
general 2023-02-13 01:42:01 unacceptable behavior
general 2023-02-13 01:57:53 well the game allows you to place off grid
general 2023-02-13 01:58:02 so the welding is designed for that
general 2023-02-13 01:58:29 i think people say motors are broken cause it’s easier to place them in more precise ways
general 2023-02-13 01:58:48 well idk i fix motor bugs everyday update lmao
general 2023-02-13 01:59:02 a game i made in fortnite creative
general 2023-02-13 03:09:15 no!
general 2023-02-13 03:15:46 the best game of them all
general 2023-02-13 03:17:09 skill-
general 2023-02-13 03:17:44 save and load your build
general 2023-02-13 03:17:53 it should clean up any bugs
general 2023-02-13 03:22:07 beat my record of 84 hours
general 2023-02-13 03:22:46 damn that would be cool
general 2023-02-13 03:23:34 thing is im probably working with advanced scripters
general 2023-02-13 03:23:58 like if scripting lua was a skill level, id only be like 7/10
general 2023-02-13 23:35:18 damn my game is picking up
general 2023-02-13 23:35:27 what i want is for my game to be successful but not absolutely destroy plane crazy
general 2023-02-13 23:35:32 hard thing
general 2023-02-13 23:35:45 just hard to get rid of
general 2023-02-13 23:36:07 mouse guided motors will probably never exist
general 2023-02-13 23:36:10 i mean eventually will
general 2023-02-13 23:36:15 just contradicted myself lol
general 2023-02-13 23:36:29 i could maybe make shredders a offense and add votekick ez
general 2023-02-13 23:36:52 i'm just a little worried over pc being upset at me cause some youtubers are saying they want to switch to flightpoint
general 2023-02-13 23:37:10 true
general 2023-02-13 23:37:11 i think
general 2023-02-13 23:37:14 reporting is the best idea
general 2023-02-13 23:37:20 then i could get the target userid
general 2023-02-13 23:37:23 and go through all their save slots
general 2023-02-13 23:37:31 or just get a mod
general 2023-02-13 23:37:41 and if they say someone is guilty, they just dm me banned userids
general 2023-02-13 23:38:44 also when i say youtubers switching
general 2023-02-13 23:38:47 well nvm
general 2023-02-13 23:38:55 vulpen said he might even take a look at flightpoint
general 2023-02-13 23:39:02 never leave plane crazy though
general 2023-02-13 23:39:13 actually no wait
general 2023-02-13 23:39:14 not vulpen

general 2023-02-13 23:41:12 thats another problem
general 2023-02-13 23:41:15 the game is a bit more advanced
general 2023-02-13 23:58:09 flightpoint at its least complicated state
general 2023-02-13 23:59:06 frtnite battelpass!!! i just shit out my asssss booted up my pc, to play some pc (4), i love pc (4) or (3) or (2) idk lmao

creations-chat 2023-03-07 21:29:28 bro lmao
your boat is also like a box. it barely looks like the actual yacht

1. it's not detailed, looks like 2 hours went into it only
2. the yacht shown on the left is smooth while yours is not. literally take an hour to learn motorlock and stuff.
3. your windows are not accurate. you're saying how accurate your yacht is
4. your superstructure is too tall
5. like i said before, you even told me my yacht looked like a box when yours does too
6. your hull does not have the same color or material

general 2023-03-08 20:12:56 Motor is a default motorblock. It uses both servo and normal motor capabilities, however it can be a little glitchy.

Servo motors are the equivalent to Motor2 in Plane Crazy
NonServo motors are equivalent to normal Motors in Plane Crazy

general 2023-03-18 22:45:23 next update
general 2023-03-18 22:45:27 now that i've thought about it
general 2023-03-18 22:45:35 just get the player character velocity
general 2023-03-18 22:45:37 invert that
general 2023-03-18 22:45:43 then have a cone face in that direction
general 2023-03-18 22:45:46 ez
general 2023-03-18 23:01:31 probably a cone that spawns at the camera
general 2023-03-18 23:01:43 it starts being absolutely reansparent
general 2023-03-18 23:01:53 then it grows in size depending on the size of nearby blocks to the camera
general 2023-03-18 23:02:00 that should do it

general 2023-03-18 23:09:36 well i could do median
general 2023-03-18 23:09:48 i think
general 2023-03-18 23:09:53 make the cone spawn at player character
general 2023-03-18 23:10:24 ez idea
general 2023-03-18 23:10:24 wait
general 2023-03-18 23:10:30 i mean
general 2023-03-18 23:10:30 no
general 2023-03-18 23:10:35 it would change if a block was 10000 studs away
general 2023-03-18 23:10:45 here
general 2023-03-18 23:10:46 how about
general 2023-03-18 23:10:48 instead of cone
general 2023-03-18 23:10:55 just use sonic boom sound

general 2023-03-19 02:24:27 there's another one?
general 2023-03-19 02:36:03 i just spent 2 and a half hours making a sonic boom
general 2023-03-19 13:41:10 it actually does  follow the player for 3 seconds (2.5 is close enough). i just have it move away. if that's unrealistic, i can remove it
general 2023-03-19 13:41:22 *remove the trail-away effect
general 2023-03-19 13:45:35 we wont mention the fact that it took me an hour to figure out how to make the boom spawn away from the direction the player is moving in lmao
general 2023-03-19 13:46:07 ```
part.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos-(hrp.Velocity.Unit*(i*1.25)),pos)*CFrame.Angles(math.rad(0),math.rad(-90),0)```
general 2023-03-19 13:46:28 i had everything correct except

general 2023-05-01 20:22:55 yeah
general 2023-05-01 20:22:59 but i cant math 😭
general 2023-05-01 20:23:05 thats why its heavily delayed
general 2023-05-01 20:23:09 how about i make a deal
general 2023-05-01 20:23:14 when rick makes pc2, i made mirror
general 2023-05-01 20:26:33 his shader sucskxsw!
general 2023-05-01 20:26:37 wait
general 2023-05-01 20:26:40 what if i add a settings menu
general 2023-05-01 20:26:45 and you can enable  "whizify lighting"
general 2023-05-01 20:26:46 ez
general 2023-05-01 20:27:07 okay code me a function that mirrors a model based on a set origin
general 2023-05-01 20:28:09 no wait
general 2023-05-01 20:28:11 thats the easy part
general 2023-05-01 20:28:29 changing position is easy
general 2023-05-01 20:28:31 according to an origin
general 2023-05-01 20:28:33 the hard part is cframe
general 2023-05-01 20:28:37 like
general 2023-05-01 20:28:40 lmao
general 2023-05-01 20:28:40 visually flipping
general 2023-05-01 20:28:47 you cant just change the orientation
general 2023-05-01 20:28:53 cause then that could mess up config of some stuff
general 2023-05-01 20:28:59 so blocks have to be kind of rebuilt
general 2023-05-01 20:29:05 some at least
general 2023-05-01 20:31:21 welds, certain constraints
general 2023-05-01 20:31:25 i've tried a lot of times
general 2023-05-01 20:31:43 no wait
general 2023-05-01 20:31:47 that makes it look like i gave up
general 2023-05-02 01:58:04 <@588029553281204235> release pc2 already!!

general 2023-05-02 02:01:11 funny
general 2023-05-02 02:31:43 don’t overwork yourself to the point where you need mirrors in the meantime
general 2023-05-02 02:31:55 im working on other things

general 2023-05-02 02:35:06 look
general 2023-05-02 02:35:12 the main concern
general 2023-05-02 02:35:34 mirroring big builds can cause so much lag
general 2023-05-02 02:35:47 and if it’s accidental, you’re screwed
general 2023-05-02 02:36:19 more lag
general 2023-05-02 02:36:36 its an offset feature
general 2023-05-02 02:36:56 still has to replicate somehow
general 2023-05-02 02:37:15 <@538169956735647745> press backspace to reset

plane-crazy 2023-06-09 23:59:56 new update in test servers fixes that up a lot
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:22 is it the wingpanel issues?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:25 doesnt make much sense?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:33 should be a lot better
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:38 wanna know something funny?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:45 motors were the problem, not the wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:00:59 the servos were so poorly coded, they just broke the wings somehow
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:01:11 so try building a __new__ plane in test servers
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:01:12 see how it does
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:04:25 i didnt even fix the physics intentionally
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 00:04:34 i just realized randomly after fixing up the motors that i would actually turn in the direction i rolled in

general 2023-07-03 23:34:51 to all of you who say you play plane crazy often
general 2023-07-03 23:34:52 smh
general 2023-07-04 01:35:10 if they weren't, then response times on every block would be really noticable
general 2023-07-04 01:41:55 serverside physics on a players build would make response times 100-500 ms depending on ping. this means that big builds would affect your flight experience
general 2023-07-04 01:42:28 clientside physics just let the owner of the build experience what happens real time on their computer without any lag
general 2023-07-04 01:42:36 that ping just affects other players watching the build
general 2023-07-04 01:42:50 to see whether or not pc if client sided in terms of physics, just place a single block, spawn in, and push it around
general 2023-07-04 01:43:01 if its reactions to your character are not instant, then the game is serversided and i am wrong

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:38:53 are you sane
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:51:29 none
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:55:14 lock motors as much as possible
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:55:16 just dont unpower them
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:55:27 that will make them not move at all when you dont interact with them
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:55:32 only unpower and lock them for motorlock towers
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:58:50 just dont power lock motors at all
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:58:52 for motorlock towers
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:59:17 the point of locked motors are so they dont turn when you dont interact with them
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:59:19 they are locked
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:59:26 but rick gave it a visual to compact down half a block
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:59:33 so people just use that config to compact towers down
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 19:59:34 thats all
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:03:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:03:59 if you want motorlock, just unpower the motor so you dont accidently rotate them and mess up the motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:04:13 if you want to have a stable motor that is strong, then lock it with powered on
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:07:23 lag is not in the matter
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:07:35 powered just determines whether or not the motor will respond to any key input at all
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 20:39:21 no it only has triangle wedge

general 2023-07-16 20:17:26 i guess it is a good idea to generalize exploiting when taking action
general 2023-07-16 20:18:13 an exploiter can use something for a good and creative reason and closet cheat at the expense of everyone elses enjoyment of the game
general 2023-07-16 20:18:16 it can be hard to detect
general 2023-07-16 20:18:31 and have only the former be recognized
general 2023-07-16 20:18:56 flightpoint isn't plane crazy
