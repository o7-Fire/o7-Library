creations-chat 2022-01-14 04:06:24 I like the use of the skis and the ladders
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:51:26 s_suri I guess you're right
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:51:33 It's Roblox's ball
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:51:48 I apologize SeaLevelCondensers
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:51:55 They were obviously not joking
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:52:04 I take everything I see online seriously
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:52:29 ?

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:58:22 F4
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:58:33 You take that back though, because the tutorial's nose is motorlocked
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:58:38 It looks nothing like mine
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:04:23 How in jesus do I attach things
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:05:36 Where is the plus
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:06:42 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:07:25 : /
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:07:35 I'll just DM the dude
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:08:22 What level do I need to be
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:08:31 I'm not on discord very often
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:06 huh
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:20 I do have a pretty high level if I say so myself lol
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:27 (/s)
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:54 !rank
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:12 So if I chat more that means I can level up?
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:20 Oh
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:29 This probably means I should rnak up
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:32 rank*
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:11:04 Frankie you bastard, now it looks like I'm some tutorial chaning kid
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:11:09 changing(
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:11:12 changing*
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:13:42 The dude in the video has a lot of friends, maybe I should get me some of those : (
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:04 Yeah because you told me that the bomber I worked hard on was a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:08 That's low dude
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:10 real low
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:12 : |
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:22 Yea he is
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:33 It is pretty funny though ngl
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:47 The wings?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:14:54 because I did use angled motor 2's for that
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:15:19 I do admit the elevators and stabilizers are similiar but not identical
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:15:54 Ok, but why would I do all that
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:16:00 Why would I go through all of that
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:16:26 If I were some snot nosed kid, it would make sense for me to just take the tutorial with no alterations
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:16:54 I had a stroke reading that
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:17:03 You're paying for my medical fees
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:17:19 I never even knew the dude's YT channel existed until now
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:17:53 besides I have screenshots of this bomber before the video was even posted
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:18:13 Though I need to level up to show them
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:18:22 Can you attach files in DM's?

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:23:34 Click on that link
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:06 NOVEMBER 15th 2021
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:14 Anything else?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:29 I want to emphasize "2021"
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:38 Is there a bold font or something
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:46 Or Italics
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:24:51 Maybe underline
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:25:15 If you couldn't tell, I was being sarcastic
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:25:31 It was pretty obvious when I said "I take everything on the internet seriously"
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:25:33 Or something
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:26:07 I like my sarcasm to be realistic ; )
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:26:17 Like painfully realistic
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:26:30 Eh that screenshot was before I added the 3d wings
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:26:43 And that was the major bomber I ever did
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:26:53 Damn someone's mad that their wrong
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:27:14 Wait what
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 15:27:16 Dang

creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:38:41 I don't have any words to describe my confusion
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:42:13 No this is not a tutorial, please don't ask
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:46:46 anyone have suggestions to make my B-17g better in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:03:35 proof?
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:05:53 It's the most unsightly thing ab the build : (
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:14:21 so you agree it's not a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 16:48:59 Why the server shut downs?! So many pvp servers have been shut down because of this "preloading update"
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 17:58:09 What the fuck is wrong with this update
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 17:58:24 What issue is it solving
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 20:30:56 Bro what the fuck man I want to play ONLINE PVP
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:23:21 "The Game Got Updated, What's New?"
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:33:51 Y'all I have good news I'm on a PVP server and it hasn't shown the update screen
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 06:34:40 
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:45:21 Will I get 10000000 F-22s sent to my home for being the 10000000th person to post an F-22
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:47:31 That's a tad bit concerning, but I'm grateful for the prize considering my efforts
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:49:54 Why not 10000000 pipebombs : (
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:05:19 No I used https://imagecolorpicker.com/en, with the attached image (except I slightly edited the RGB values so that they are slightly lighter than the ones in the picture)
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:10:27 Yeah the nose and the canopy (and the exposed locking), are pretty bad but I wouldn't say that it's horseshit (not sure if you meant the paint, or the actual jet itself). But then again I did post it in <#384025409945337856> so I guess I shouldn't have expected the reactions to be good.
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:14:52 For future reference, what did you mean that it was horseshit. What made it so that it was justifiable to call it horseshit, this is so I can avoid those mistakes when I build it (or other builds) again in the future
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:32:45 Thanks! Btw is this: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/f22-raptor-2a64abf0866a405c865466c7642ca689 a good 3D model to reference while building an F-22
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:46:26 Also thanks for going through the trouble of editing the images to show what you were talking about
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:08:43 Was it really that bad (though I still do think the things you pointed out were valid), or was it really bland and not innovative (as in it didn't really do anything to add onto what you usually see in a Plane Crazy F-22)
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:16:00 Was it bad to the point where it's as bad as, for example, Plane Crazy's official tutorial plane with spammed rockets and guns? I really did try on this build to not be as bad as possible : (
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:22:45 As in bad when held to the standard of players like justrens (I don't know that many famous plane crazy builders)? or is it bad when held to the standards of people who are ok/sorta good
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:29:27 He's quite nice : D, he gave me actual feedback
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:31:52 Oh ok, well, thanks for your help!
