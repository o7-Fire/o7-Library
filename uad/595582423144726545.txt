plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:31:36 ok, chat's silent again, time to continue to discuss about game

plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:31:47 pretty confusing but, still gret
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:31:52 10/10
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:32:42 fair nuff
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:35:41 right, thanks
general 2021-11-10 08:36:25 woa
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:41:54 you should consider not doing it
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:43:27 is it even a cliche if the game's called "Plane Crazy" where from the name most people would build planes or jets anyways?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:43:49 and like, 3-6% of people would build other stuff like cars, boats or rail vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:44:08 and then there's me who's only original build is one of Thomas The Wonkin Tonkin Tank Engine
bot-central 2021-11-10 08:45:14 !rank
bot-central 2021-11-10 08:45:27 eh, ill get to Level 3 sometime
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:46:22 he's not wrong y'now

general 2021-11-10 08:47:47 *oh no*
general 2021-11-10 08:53:46 woa
general 2021-11-10 08:53:51 a mosque
general 2021-11-10 08:53:52 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:55:22 man really said it doesn't take skill to make jets ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:55:43 like, dude

it takes skill to literally make ANY- wait you can curse without getting a warn?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:56:00 ah, great
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:56:01 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:56:17 so motherfucker really said
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:56:31 deadass, it doesn't take real skill to make jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:56:35 smh
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:57:04 man will really undermine anybody's work cause it's a fucking jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:57:52 plus like, cmon

We all took work in literally everything, even jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:59:21 then you probably worded this wrong
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:59:40 "they actually take skill to make unlike jets"
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:59:49 now im probably cherry picking a small part here
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:59:52 but, man
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 08:59:59 fuck that, fuck saying it takes actual skill to make something unlike another thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:01:18 actually, should we even care if it's cliched? lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:01:53 speaking of helicopters, i remembered this time i tried to make one out of a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:02:13 that was a year ago-
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:02:23 motherfucker-
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:02:26 that was a year ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:02:33 legit, i am tired of this man
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:03:03 ill admit, most of my shit is tut, and the only original thing is my on rails Thomas with came out looking nicely and made today
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:03:18 and guess what
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:03:34 they were made the same time as the heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:03:46 i, actually will

starting with trains really
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:04:04 so ill tell ya'll if i came out alive lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:04:33 but back to my point:
most of my builds were made during late 2020 with tuts

and i just started again with a rail Tommy, made myself
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:04:54 i would send a picture, but uh

im a white name, so
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:05:06 i mean, they kinda don't lol

they
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:05:21 they're just dum kids trying to make smth
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:05:44 hell, ill admit smth
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:05:54 the chassis for my scratch built thomas?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:06:11 that's from a tut about steam engine coupling roads in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:06:39 and it took me longer to make it work than id admit
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:08:52 ill admit, very pretty
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:09:39 cry about it, he posted it
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:10:23 people make shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:10:47 man
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:10:54 ill be proud to say this
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:10:56 but, just
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:10:57 shut up
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:11:06 stop giving a shit if people use tuts
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:11:23 they'll learn how to make their own stuff eventually

i know i have
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:11:42 and that coupling rod tut is prob gonna be the last ill use for a while
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:11:48 facts yo
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:12:09 like, if they're a douche bout it, then ill be fine with making fun of them
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:12:54 lol, L
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:13:13 but back to my point:
if they just want to make smth and feel inable, then just, don't mind them
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:13:43 hell my first plane that isn't the game tutorial plane acutally is a tut, cause up to this day i feel i can't make a plane without it having a stroke and crashing into the sea

plane-crazy 2021-11-10 09:14:57 YOOO I CAN SEND PICTURES!!!
