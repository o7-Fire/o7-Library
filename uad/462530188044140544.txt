help 2020-11-13 23:16:11 does anyone know how to make an effective railgun

help 2020-11-15 02:55:17 What is the best way to control a conveyor driven plane?
help 2020-11-15 02:55:36 I have an SR71 but it has terrible handling
help 2020-11-15 02:56:22 Even when the entire fuselage is control surfaces it goes into a spin at about 5000 speed when trying to turn
help 2020-11-15 03:01:09 so I should use motor 2s and couple them to my control surfaces?
help 2020-11-15 03:01:29 or is it done with regular wings

help 2020-11-21 02:38:07 any idea as to how I should give this a roof to make the turret flush?
help 2020-11-21 02:38:29 the motorlock has to rotate
help 2020-11-21 02:38:35 so I can't put the roof on there
help 2020-11-21 23:30:44 is there any way to stop missiles motorlocked together from going at like 0.69 studs per second
help 2020-11-21 23:31:37 really affecting my pvp performance at times

plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:36:34 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:36:48 how do I counter them noobs with explosive blocks and 4 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:37:02 they just keep ramming and the explosive blocks act as armour too
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:37:33 they just keep respawning and i cannot actually have fun
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:37:40 not that I cannot shoot the wheels
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:38:32 might try making a fighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:38:39 but my motorlock is terrible
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 10:43:19 are guns motorlocked together better or are they better when there is spread
