bot-central 2021-03-28 19:35:40 &suggest 
A marketplace.
A place on the map where players can buy limited time items.
To do this there would be a currency system that rewards players for completing challenges or seasonal events. Also maybe a daily login bonus.
Items would not be incredibly expensive, more of a reward for checking into the game every now and then. 
This feature wouldn't be like Big Games' My Restaurant auction system, where players would have to advance or learn much, but rather a small implementation for newer and veteran players.
This would be hard to implement, but would be a cool update. Thanks for reading.
