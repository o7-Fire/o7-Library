plane-crazy 2020-08-23 16:28:21 Happened on a plane crazy server earlier today
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 23:00:30 I’m working on a large drone with propeller blades that can retract back into the machine, do you guys have any suggestions on something interesting that I can add to the drone other than the retractable blades?
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 23:02:39 Also does anybody know how to get the outlines on blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 23:03:07 Cus when I building it’s hard to see with all the blocks being white Yknow

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 23:04:00 I was scrolling up on this channel and someone must have had an old screenshot Cus they had an outline
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:23:32 Shredder bugs are the most annoying thing in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:24:17 I can deal with the minion armies Cus all you gotta do is just fly
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:38:20 hey guys im somewhat new to this, can someone tell me what friction blocks are used for
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:40:45 working on a large yacht that can fly
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:40:53 but im still confused what friction bloks are for
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:44:45 to stop sliding on the ground or can it be used withfolding to stpo them moving apart easily
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:46:25 i thought locked motors just pulled them in im so stupid
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:46:29 wow im dumb
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 08:46:57 man i should learn things before posting here
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:08:21 you guys have any tips on how to keep a large boat stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:04 yea the boat tends to slowly but surely fall over to one side regardless of the ballasts and helium
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:06 oh on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:13 ill give that a shot
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:18 thanks guys
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:28 i can give you guys a photo if you want
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:09:52 well
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:10:00 ignore the proppelers
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:10:04 propellers*
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:10:17 i just want it to stay stable in the water
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:13:33 wait so are you sure the helium needs to go on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:14:38 yea im trying to make it a flying yacht
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 12:15:23 so pontoons bottom, helium sides and ballast on the floor of the boat
general 2020-09-11 13:12:03 i was in a game with fonkl now im heartbroken he left
general 2020-09-11 13:12:08 but mark my words i will find him again

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 13:50:23 smh im such an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:39:08 how the hell are you supposed to keep a flying boat stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:39:31 you guys ever done that thing when you add a helium block or remove one each time
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:40:08 i keep adding one or removing one helium or ballast and i dont think its ever gonna be stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:46:01 
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 14:46:11 why pay for a vip server when you can wait in one server for 4 hours
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:06:01 drones wouldnt qualify as vtols would they?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:12:42 i mean technically they are called vtol drones but that wouldnt qualify you for vtol engineer wouldnt it
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:23:19 yea but are drones counted
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:43:36 holy crap i made a working vtol based of a picture i saw
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:43:46 now im proud
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:56:57 pain
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:22:38 what do you guys think of my new vtol
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:23:27 its based off a picture i saw
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:23:40 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:23:41 its based of of this picture
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:24:09 im trying to get the glass cockpit to look good tho
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:24:13 so i see what you mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:25:11 thanks, you got any recommendations
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:25:25 like any feedback on what to improve on
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:27:20 maybe use locked motors and half blocks to make the wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:30:35 how the hell does that thing even fly irl
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:30:56 yea i know flaps but the weight on that thing looks so uneven
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:35:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:13:34 lmao i didnt realise that private servers were a paid subscription i thought it was a one time payment
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:13:55 but heck its only like 10R$ a month or something
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:26:49 what are your opinions on my vtol aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:27:28 oh and yea fully functional 203 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:27:34 yes it c h o n k

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:28:55 i think
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:29:15 i know its Vertical takeoff and landing but i think its Vtol not v-tol
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:29:46 idk why you would need the Hyphen
creations-chat 2020-09-12 10:21:03 ravioli ravioli give me the formuali
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:04:32 ayyy finally got my first rank even though its extremely basic and probably everyone already has this rank or higher
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:05:04 but hey, cant i just be happy that i got rank in the first place
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:10:51 hey does anybody like the up house i made in creations
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:56:14 when youre bored so you turn your plane into a vtol for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:08:57 hey i just want to ask if the mods would allow drones as vtol aircraft?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:09:07 would they qualify if i wanted to get a rank for vtol?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:09:46 ok hell yea
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:30:23 im trying to put propellers **inside** a wing, but i want to motor lock the wings onto half blocks. im going to put the motor on top of the propeller instead of underneath but i think that would ruin the look, what do you reckon
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:30:28 i can show a photo?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:30:50 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:31:14 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:31:34 i dont think it would look too bad but im not sure what other people think
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:33:09 nvm i fixed the problem gosh im an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:42:28 yea so im making a vtol aircraft with propellers **inside** the wings and you know the build is gonna be large when only one *unfinished wing* is 123 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:58:41 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:58:47 what do you guys think of my propellers inside my wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:59:33 those 2 wings contain 250 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:59:39 oh boy this thing is gonna be big
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:00:07 maybe idk
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:00:13 but its a vtol plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:00:29 so im hoping that its a high number
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:02:44 some dude in my game has a goddamn stick bug and he just stick bugged the entire lobby

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:58:43 progress on my vtol with propellers inside the wings, what do you guys think so far
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:59:19 fyi the wings are locked with half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:59:24 if that wasnt obvious
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:00:10 i know its ugly but i kinda like that idea of the propellers
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:02:06 i have one question for all you guys

**how in the fuck are you guys so damn smart**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:07:07 i would and can prove that im significantly more dumb than you

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:29:35 this is what it looks like now
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:29:52 oh im trying to make a vtol aircraft with propellers built into the wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:30:05 heck im just trying
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:31:42 **colonel, im trying to take off the ground, but im dummy thicc, and weight of the plane keeps holding me down**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:35:27 > h e l i u m

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:37:18 i dont really care im just gonna keep building and then see what the block count is
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:37:58 but yeah super rocket engine do exist
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 15:38:14 im just gonna try and use small propeller engines for the movement i guess

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:08:54 hey so ive been working on my vtol plane with propellers inside the wings, do you reckon that making the wings bend like a Corsair F4U would look cool?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:09:09 k hold on
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:09:42 \
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:10:02 should i go to the effort of bending the wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:10:09 yea it is a drone
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:10:16 its a vtol plane technically but sure
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:44:42 the dude to my left is making the goddamn hoverball
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:50:51 why

creations-chat 2020-09-13 08:10:14 btw in flight mode the half blocks lock into wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 10:53:14 hey i know this is a stupid question but does a 1x3 plane wing and 3 1x1 plane wings weigh the same or would there be a purpose to have one or the otehr
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:25:18 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:25:21 u guys got a name for this finished build
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:25:39 took me like 2 days but hey i enjoyed it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:25:49 idk what to call it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:26:46 imma submit it for a new vtol rank but i wanna give it a name other than "vtol aircraft 2"
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:27:26 what is that gonna stand for
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:29:11 dude im not as smart as some of you guys theres a lot of terms that i might not know
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 11:29:39 i dont really know if WAP stands for something or you just wanna call it the wap
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:01:29 ok so if you go fast enough falling down in plane crazy you can go straight through the ground and come out underneath
general 2020-09-13 12:20:32 why
general 2020-09-13 12:20:35 just whu
general 2020-09-13 12:21:26 ok

general 2020-09-13 12:21:53 i see what you did there
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 11:01:41 just realised the ship ive been working on is over 4000 blocks <:PogU:670373666164572172>
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 11:05:33 might as well try and get expert shipwright rank with the ship cus why not
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:17:34 
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:17:43 you guys got any ideas on what to put on top of my yacht
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:18:42 bong 747
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:20:13 i kinda want to put a small landing strip so people can land on it but idk
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:20:21 idk if thats a good idea or not
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:22:06 a foldable runway?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 11:22:15 like one that i can put away?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:16:07 how do people even make controllable rockets like what do you use to make it turn
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:16:44 when your going in a straight line wouldnt on/off rocket turning make it turn way too fast
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:16:48 oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:16:52 i meant missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:17:11 not rocket ships and space shipes not i meant missiles with cameras on them how do youturn those
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:17:26 i swear to god my space bar is broken
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:21:09 yes but how do you even turn missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:21:47 oh ok yeah that would make a lotta sense
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:08:17 how tf do mechs even work
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:08:21 its dark magic to me
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:36:26 you guys got any ideas for what to put in a large yacht (around 4000 blocks)
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:37:02 yea idk what to put in as interior
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:37:21 i have a recording studio, a games room, a lounge room and a viewing deck
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 07:37:24 idk what else to put in
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 08:20:48 my yacht with a heli pad and a landing strip for planes to land on and come inside, hope you like it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 08:40:11 thanks
creations-chat 2020-09-16 08:40:22 took me like 6 days for everything to be done

creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:15:51 what do you mean vtol is the hardest to get
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:16:09 i mean it might be for some people but i thought rocket scientist wouldve been harder
general 2020-09-17 07:29:52 > <@!637206552381751326> ranked
thanks
creations-chat 2020-09-20 14:40:18 and then theres the one dude with shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-09-20 14:40:58 still doesnt really change the fact that they are annoying as fuck
creations-chat 2020-09-20 14:41:48 depends what you consider slow
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 06:42:08 i think i have an addiction to making drones
creations-chat 2020-09-25 08:10:31 what
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:31:55 ive tried for so long how the heck do you go faster than 700 speed
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:32:22 i genuinely dont know
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:32:48 wdym
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:33:09 Oh i make builds but ive never built anything intended to go fast
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:33:39 look i just dont make builds with speedy things in them ok
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:33:55 i never make fast builds, im still learning that part of the game
creations-chat 2020-09-26 13:34:13 thats why im asking you guys i didnt realise you guys wouldn't like it that i didnt know lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 09:14:17 just used a conveyer engine for the first time and holy shit my jet now goes 5000 speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 10:37:59 i dont have any inspiration
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 10:38:04 what the hell am i gonna make
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 02:00:44 anybody got any ideas on what to make
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 02:00:51 im bored idk what the hell to make
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 02:03:51 **speed**
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 02:33:43 i forgot how weird cameras can be
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 02:34:09 i place two cameras facing each other with a huge jet engine behind it and went into flight mode and just got flinged across the map
creations-chat 2020-10-08 02:48:57 
creations-chat 2020-10-08 02:49:13 i did the thing
creations-chat 2020-10-08 02:58:57 d

creations-chat 2020-10-13 08:00:51 does anybody think i should try and make a f-111
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 04:58:00 He could be any one of us
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 04:58:04 He could be you
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 04:58:07 He could be me
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 04:58:16 He could even be-
general 2020-10-19 06:38:53 Someone post this in another server
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 10:20:29 when your plane is so big huge jet engine arent big enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 10:20:54 should i make a custom jet engine?
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 10:21:02 like an even bigger one
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 10:21:20 aight
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:53:16 why do people always just walk into my plots and jump on everything and get in my raod all the time
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:53:38 road*
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:53:50 i know i hate it so much
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:55:54 > <@!637206552381751326> cuz they wanna copy the build <:thoink:657279634563399720>
<@!707991071476547745> good luck trying to copy my build with 2000+ blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:57:33 im trying to build a really big private jet so i can just set it to cruise at an altitude and just chill
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:58:16 uh motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:58:22 thats pretty much all i can say
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:58:26 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 11:58:54 sure
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 12:04:39 and me
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 12:04:55 i volunteer myself to the pinging
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:38:08 when even the huge jet engines are still too small for your build
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:38:13 what do i do now
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:39:24 what do i do when even the huge jet engine are too small
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:15:53 to all the geniuses that play this game, do you guys have any advice on making a flush door that folds down from a private jet? im trying to make one but i want to try and make it as flush as possible
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:18:36 how do i make a goddamn flush folding entrance door to a jet
creations-chat 2020-10-21 07:15:40 wait what have the rules been changed? since when but ok

general 2021-01-01 01:09:15 Fair point
general 2021-01-01 01:09:21 ill see myself out
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 09:05:48 helicopters in this game is witchcraft and nobody can tell me otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:44:02 just spent 4 hours making a vtol
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:44:14 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:44:23 do you mean a model?
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:44:26 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:44:39 yeah its a plane with rocket engines built into the wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:45:01 but cramming the motor locking and rocket rotating into the small space was hell
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:45:23 no i was thinking of doing an irl vtol but i actually just improvise and kinda made my own
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:45:40 yea nah
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:45:53 i was just making my own one really
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:46:06 but it took me ages trying to get it so compact
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:46:11 its rather small
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:46:37 i had to motor lock the wing panels into the half blocks and then fit the rotating rockets as well
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:46:54 oh yeah mine is like half that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:00 or less idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:08 i dont know why i spent so long working on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:20 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:23 real good
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:29 it was 4 hours tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:47:51 all i need to do now is just give it a paint job and show off to my friends
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 12:48:18 wow ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 21:20:09 you need a masters degree in aeronautical engineering to make a helicopter in this game i dont understand it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 21:20:54 i havnt really played a whole lot of this game to understand helicopters yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 21:21:04 i know how they work but i just cant seem to get it right
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 21:26:55 yea because its a good build
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:01:03 idk if motor lock is bugged or if i have done something wrong but the motors that rotate my rocket engines in my vtol just made the rockets just yeet themselves from the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:03:42 no not like that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:04:02 the motor that rotates the engines are locked so they arent moved by other parts of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:05:42 aight
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:06:20 
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:06:29 just that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:06:42 literally thats all it is but there are 4 of them
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:07:17 and when rotating to swap from vertical to horizontal sometimes some of them just get stuck and its on a different angle to the reest of them even thought they are hitting any blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:07:35 and to make sure thats not the problem all of the motors have the max torque at max
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:08:44 oh yeah im working on the colouration
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:09:17 its just full of motors and trails and motor locks and its just pain to give it a paintjob
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:10:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:10:15 all of the rockets do
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:10:21 but they somehow get stuck
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:10:40 even though the motors have the max torque
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:11:29 still has the problem locked or not
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:11:37 ill just figure it out
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:11:39 dont worry
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:11:46 vtols will be the death of me
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:14:02 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:14:08 the pilot seat can also control the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:14:18 or can regular seats already do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:15:00 you need to have the main pilot seat in the plane but you can jump out and sit in the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:15:19 yea so main pilot seat and pilot seat can control the plane but regular seats cant
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:15:36 its useful in a passenger plane when you can sit in a passenger seat and still fly it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:15:43 no, only you can fly the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:02 although it would be cool if other people could fly your plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:35 dude i know
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:43 about it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:45 oops
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:53 the typo
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:16:59 i made a goddamn typo
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:17:36 sentient
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 22:17:45 its the revolution of the machines
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 08:29:01 yknow how everyone wants more wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 08:29:15 im gonna do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 08:29:38 
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 08:29:42 THERE WE GO BOIS
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 08:33:24 a scientific breakthrough
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 04:43:58 anybody got any ideas on how to stabilise a heli
general 2021-01-22 14:04:36 hand over your bone fluid
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:06:39 how do yall stabilise helis
bot-central 2021-01-22 14:09:53 =p baker street
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:13:32 oh no i got that
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:13:47 its just when its flying its wobbling everywhere when i turn and all that
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:14:03 should i be using control panels or do you guys have any other methods to help stabilise
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:16:17 the motors are fine, ive done vtols plenty of times before but helicopters are something ive been trying to learn for quite some time now
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:17:28 also yes metal is heavier
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:17:34 wtf we just did that at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:17:48 oh yeah sure hold on
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:18:18 keep in mind this is my first time ive actually built a heli
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:24 heres a closeup
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:58 oh no they dont turn until i press a or d
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:03 then either one of them turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:16 (this is my first time building a heli, i know thats not how you do it)
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:22:01 when going straight up and also when returning the props back to normal
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:22:04 its just a bit wobbly but im fairly sure its just the weight distribution of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:22:33 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:23:42 ive done vtols before so i had kind of an idea of what i was going for
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:25:06 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:25:20 and the Vtol engineer II rank you have must be from your other Vtols
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:26:44 the reason i got vtol III was because i like to build things a bit differently so i put rotors **inside** the wings of a plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:26:54 also hover drives should be a religion at this point ngl
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:29:02 surely i cant be the only one who uses trails to connect objects to one another
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:29:21 like when you put a control surface behind another control surface and you just slap two trails on the side
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 00:31:17 what if you just slap a conveyer engine  onto a heli
general 2021-04-11 06:56:18 left this server ages ago
general 2021-04-11 06:56:20 now im back
general 2021-04-11 07:01:38 it felt like a while
general 2021-04-11 07:22:19 amogu
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:30:54 how many hours yall got on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:34:15 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 10:40:02 anybody got ny ideas on how to make a plane turn faster
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 10:41:11 one of my planes isnt turning fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 10:42:19 even using a d to turn is incredibly slow
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 10:42:26 just sideways
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 10:42:48 the plane s having difficulty turning sideways (roll)
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:10:39 **this**
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:10:59 i know exactly what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:11:18 my goddamn planes look so ugly
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:12:16 ive got a jet which i want to go fast, any ideas on what i should use? conveyor drives? magnet drives, anything?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:23:31 is there a way to make hover engine faster cus ive got like 3 but im only reaching  150 s/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:24:13 when you piss rickje off enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:52:11 heres a picture of the plane that im making, any ideas for which engine i should use to make it go fast? ive tried hover engines but i cant get higher than 250 s/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:52:43 cant get it higher than 250 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:53:08 even when i make a lot of them
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:53:50 i forgot about conveyer engines my bad
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 04:53:56 that might work
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 05:22:37 amen
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 06:39:43 anyone made proper landing gear for a plane? (wheels that actually rotate and turn, plus retract while plane is flying)
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 06:39:52 kinda need some ideas
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 10:16:57 anyone know how to do motor locking cockpit windows
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 10:17:08 im horrible at motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 10:18:47 im trying to make a twin prop plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 10:19:01 yknow the ones that look like these
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 10:19:23 im trying to do the windows with motor locking but my attempts are failing miserably
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:27:42 anyone got any good examples of making wings using motor lock?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:27:53 like making a detailed realistic wing using motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:31:06 using motor lock to put a bunch of different blocks in the same spot to make detailed wings, i cant really find a way of explaining it
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:31:14 ill see if i can get a picture
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:32:01 yea im not very good at that sort of stuff, i just want to know if anyone has any ideas
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:32:35 got any photos? maybe its what im thinking of
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:33 wow, what are you doing to do that
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:55 but the motor lock isnt very visible, where the hell are the motors
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:35:02 are they in those box looking thinsg
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:35:08 sorry for not being very descriptive
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:36:04 oh yeah i see them now
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:38:27 ok wow that a lot more complicated than what im doing
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:39:27 wouldnt it be annoying swapping camera modes with all of those cameras? i know how cameras work or motor lock but i havnt really used them before so i was just wondering
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:57 im always swapping camera modes
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:42:04 i dont know how anybody else doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:42:41 also thanks that explains a lot, i might end up using that since ive never really used them in a build bfore
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:54:44 ay yo voyager i went through a bunch of my old messages in this server from a few months ago and i kid you not we have talked before
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:54:57 not that suprising, just interesting
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:55:05 with a lot of people in this server
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:56:12 yea i dont even know why i mentioned it
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:56:14 just off
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:56:17 odd*

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:28:57 ive been using motor lock to do window separation but because the two blocks are in the same place, their textures glitch out, any ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:29:16 dont know how to get the blocks just *slightly* higher so they wont do that
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:30:14 its a half block wedge being locked into a regular wedge
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:30:40 i know thats how roblox works, but do you have any ideas on how to get them slightly apart (higher?) so that wont happen
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:30:45 they are
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:30:48 its a glass material
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:31:11 i know why
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:31:23 i just want to find out how to make it so it doesnt happen
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:31:52 oh god im an idiot
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:31:54 wow
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:32:00 that actually is a proper solution
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:32:08 goddamn my brain isnt working today
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 06:40:05 i figured out the problem, the problem was me being stupid
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:33:45 why tf my plane so damn heavy
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:34:19 like goddamn its only 224 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:34:24 no ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 09:53:36 has someone made a twin prop plane? something like a piper seneca:
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 09:53:51 ive been trying to make something like it but i just cant
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 09:53:56 i suck at recreating things
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 10:00:41 gonna need to find the person who has then
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:04 anybody know how the fuck train wheels work
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:06 and the rails
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:09 like what
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:16 which way do the wheels go
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:20 where do the wheels go
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:22 its cursed
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:11:24 someone help
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 05:14:13 nvm figured it out
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:52:28 ive built a massive house in my plot and made a wasd plane in it but when i fly it it moves so slow, why does the weight of the building it is on affect the flight when it isnt connected
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:05:39 anyone else having difficulty joining servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:21:06 can anyone explain how to do helicopters in this game? ive been trying for ages but every design ive done has had a coaxial rotor, can anyone help explain how to do single rotor helicopters?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:22:13 do you know how to do a helicopter with only 1 rotor on top and one side rotor instead of coaxial?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:23:47 yes i understand that
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:24:01 but i just cant figure out whatt to do with the side rotor
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:24:23 even if i have the side rotor spin the right way
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:24:50 yes i undertstand the countering
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:24:55 but i just cannot get it to work
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:27:15 this is just a framework thingo
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:27:24 forgive me im a dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:28:12 so i rotate wing panels?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:28:16 i can do that instead
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:28:43 alright ill give that a shot
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:30:17 also another question, do the tail rotors have to be at the same height as the main rotos
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:31:16 dont the tail rotors have to be twice the speed of the main rotors
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:31:20 cus they are hlaf the size
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:31:23 forgive my typos
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:31:45 ive done vtols before but never a proper eli'
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:31:51 this is new to me
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:32:56 heli still doesnt fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:34:07 wait nvm hold i gotta lock the motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:35:05 when i spun the rotors the panels were being pushed back to being flat
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:35:10 so it wasnt lifting up
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:35:25 so i locked the motors so that they would stay still
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:35:40 thats what i did
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:37:30 i would but i cant record
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:37:33 waitnvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:38:55 
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:39:16 fucl
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:39:50 doing it hold on

plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:40:11 there we go
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:40:29 i do not understand helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:41:02 do helicopters have to use rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:41:14 is it not possible to do it without rockets
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:44:12 god what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:44:18 helicopters are going to end my sanity
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:44:51 
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:44:55 isnt that how he did it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:45:06 look im new to helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:45:51 aight changed it to motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:47:10 surely there is an easier way to do helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:47:31 is it not possible to do it with only motor spin instead of rockets and hovers
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:47:37 https://streamable.com/o6a9jb
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:47:52 im trying to it without coaxial
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:48:07 yea that was an accident
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:48:55 how complicated are helis in this game jesus
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:49:40 i mean ive got a small crappy heli body ill give that a shot
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:51:20 i mean heres my coaxial crappy heli
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:51:26 surely i can just take off the rotors right
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:53:24 true
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:53:32 i just made a huge ass yacht and wase like yea thatll do
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:54:49 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:54:52 i need
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:54:56 to learn
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:55:34 hey just a question how fast should i made the tail rotors if im using hover engines for the main rotor
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:56:39 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:56:47 if its spinning one way
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:57:01 because of the main rotors isnt it gonna need a counteracting bacck rotor
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:57:48 then there is no point in a back rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:58:04 are you serious holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:58:07 wow
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:58:15 plane crazy helicopters are fucking wack
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 08:58:33 yea i have a serious skill issue with helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 09:06:57 https://streamable.com/far25t
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 09:07:33 yes the main problem is weight but its still spinning around in circles are you sure the back props arent supposed to be for counteracting the main props
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 09:12:17 tail???
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 09:12:24 i dont even have a tail
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 09:12:32 ahh this shit confussing
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:44:04 anyone got any ideas on how to move a heli up and down
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:44:17 cus with the motors on my heli i cant just spin them the other wya
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:44:45 im trying to keep the heli so it can stay in the same spot
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:46:42 yes i already have a heli that stays in place
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:46:49 but i need to find a way to move it up and down
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:46:56 so i can move it up and keep it in place
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:47:49 oh im using wing panels which are already rotated
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:47:54 instead of prop blades
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 07:48:01 so thart might be an issue
