creations-chat 2021-07-30 00:56:06 <@!738448924368568360>  https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/870423767220887563 how did you do the little black dots on top of the jet engines?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 00:59:38 2 block center = no no
and if ur making a boat you should make the wedge on the bottom half wedge down 1x2
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:09:10 if its a ferry then u should make it bigger so i can actually fit cars, also thats too flat for a boat hull
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:12:45 something like this, its still pretty flat but i think its got what youre look for
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:18:11 the half wedge in the wedges section of the build menu and the half wedge in the half blocks section of the menu
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:36:02 screenshot?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:51:26 you should make the front more pointy and curvy
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:00:27 just go for it, boats seem hard at first but once you get into it they're easy
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:21:12 working on an sr-71 what yall think?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:29:07 the half blocks on top? you dont need those

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:55:58 im not in game rn but the way its motor locked makes it pretty much impossible to add engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:56:10 i would take a screenshot to show if i was in game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 02:24:33 do you think we will get fighter jet engines 😳

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 02:27:42 just gonna be like minecraft probably
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 02:27:59 yes because lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 02:28:08 pc is already laggy enough for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 02:28:27 also we would need some sort of coordinates thing that would be cool so u could find friends

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 20:59:46 he said super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:00:26 im talking about 1:1 scale not robloxian scale
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:00:44 because 1:1 scale wouldn't be a robloxian 25 cm tall
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:00:52 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:01:42 reminds me of that time a nasa mission failed because they programming of their thingy used imperial measurements
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:01:49 the*
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:02:14 and command used metric lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:06:27 80 cm is almost a meter and 1 meter a second is pretty accurate to walking speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:07:21 also when going super fast I just try to not use wings cause I tend to glitch out more with them, that's probably just me and my shitty computer though
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:35:16 less lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:35:27 lag makes plane wobble it sucks ik :/

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 06:59:24 Helium works in 0g which should be impossible
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 16:50:43 they're an easier target cuz they feckin huge
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 16:59:42 I dont think they gone be much of a threat with a max speed of 700
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 17:37:56 nothing wrong with using a tutorial if you're doing it to learn how to make something and not claim it as your own build
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 17:38:06 imo
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 17:40:20 I mean an actual tutorial not one of those cringey ones

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 21:09:29 a million dollars house in california is litterally a shack

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:30 noob
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:02 dang looks like we have a toxic person 😔
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:09:08 shredders are ez to avoid so it makes them great target practice, even if you only go 500 speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:09:39 who asked
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:10:15 unoriginal unfunny "insult"

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:22:24 how do i make a cylindrical nosecone that looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:23:15 no i mean like most fighter jets have it the same angle until it gets to the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:23:19 how do i do that
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:23:28 without a cone piece
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:25:46 i said fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:27:34 die you know what i meant
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:28:26 ye like modern jets
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:29:26 like im trying to make a eurofighter but how the heck do i make this nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:29:51 no cuz

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:30:01 idk how to explain
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:30:24 no matter what im gonna half to put a pyramid wedge at the and of the nose to make it smooth
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:30:32 but it ruins the shape of the nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:30:41 cause it adds a curve
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:31:10 wym?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:31:55 image example? im confused
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:32:14 ahhhh
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:32:32 All my problems will be solved if pc2 has a cone block
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:32:39 bruh ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:35:38 the all have pyramid wedge at the end of nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:36:10 whatever ill just deal with an inaccurate nose on my euro fighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:37:43 thats pretty cool now that i see finished product
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:37:47 is it finished?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:37:49 looks like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:39:33 Imo I think using a tutorial is fine as long as you don't claim credit for it
creations-chat 2021-09-04 00:24:17 nothing the downvotes just don't know what a good creation looks like
creations-chat 2021-09-04 00:27:55 i think it should have some sort of gradient somewhere like from white to dark grey <@!739369649971527720>
general 2021-09-15 17:25:17 fart
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 17:27:22 fart

plane-crazy 2021-09-15 23:59:50 Some kid really posted a bunch of thrusters on a car and said it goes over 10k speed 💀
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 00:01:03 Fart
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 00:01:30 Not even taking off the map can get you that fast even with the thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 00:01:39 Falling
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 00:02:27 Maybe just really high gravity
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:22:56 Wondering if pc2 will have a cone wedge 🧐 would be super useful
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:24:17 How is a resize tool gonna make a cone
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 01:24:55 What
