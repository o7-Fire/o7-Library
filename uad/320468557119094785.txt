The Tale of kwakity (320468557119094785)
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 04:20:16 i played a bit too much project wingman so now im building a pw mk1 in plane crazy
general 2022-10-20 04:20:48 where can i post pictures of my plane?
general 2022-10-20 04:21:26 yeah was just about to say that
general 2022-10-20 04:22:45 im trying to use delta wings to make angled wings,how is that gonna work?...
general 2022-10-20 04:24:21 so,how feasible would it be to add a mirror mode?
general 2022-10-20 04:24:43 having to make large complex wings twice is a bit of a hassle
general 2022-10-20 04:49:07 hey quick question,why are my 2 large jet engines only able to bring me up to about 50?
general 2022-10-20 04:49:40 oh
general 2022-10-20 04:49:47 so what do i use then?
general 2022-10-20 05:41:05 bruh my plane is basically entirely control surfaces at this point
general 2022-10-20 05:42:44 i got so many control surfaces on my plane that it doesnt even matter that its completely unbalanced lmao
general 2022-10-20 05:43:06 lmao
general 2022-10-20 05:43:09 look at your dms
general 2022-10-20 05:43:24 also,does camera even do anything?
general 2022-10-20 05:49:19 i saw a guy had a glass canopy,how do i get glass?
general 2022-10-20 05:59:13 my plane goes 0 to 600 in about a second
general 2022-10-20 05:59:33 its got like 20 super rockets
general 2022-10-20 06:00:05 not yet
general 2022-10-20 06:10:48 is there no way to get more advanced controls?
general 2022-10-20 06:11:01 like,why can i not do barrel rolls?
general 2022-10-20 06:11:11 planes
general 2022-10-20 06:11:40 im using my mouse right now because i havent found any other control for it
general 2022-10-20 06:12:20 custom control surfaces?
general 2022-10-20 06:12:31 oh
general 2022-10-20 06:12:35 well uh...
general 2022-10-20 06:13:14 i kinda got a problem...
general 2022-10-20 06:13:23 look at your dm's
general 2022-10-20 08:21:55 safe to say i made a pw mk1 just as busted as the original one
general 2022-10-20 08:22:14 thing is so sensitive
general 2022-10-20 08:22:20 i kinda wish the game had controller support
general 2022-10-20 08:36:16 hey how do i use the gun?
general 2022-10-20 08:36:26 i cant change the keybind
general 2022-10-20 08:41:55 why are the weapons not working??
general 2022-10-20 08:42:29 im in a pvp server
general 2022-10-20 08:42:32 i think?
general 2022-10-20 08:44:09 i just rejoined,now im getting a "join gamemode" prompt
general 2022-10-20 08:54:32 itd be kinda cool if the 1st person freecam would auto recenter
general 2022-10-20 08:54:40 would make things alot better
general 2022-10-20 19:34:58 games pretty jank ngl
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:36:49 question,when i use missiles they just go straight
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:37:10 do they not track targets???
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:37:41 yeah id point it towards a plane and theyd just go straight
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:38:54 meanwhile im trying to get decent controls out my plane but the game doesnt have controller support
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:39:18 flight games are the only games im adamant about controllers being superior
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:39:30 anything else is just ***eh***
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:40:18 ***no controller support***
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:40:47 also,the plane physics are honestly broken
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:42:30 ill use my vertical stabiliser rudders and itll just...how do i even explain this,it just kinda...drifts?...like a car?.. but when i stop using it it just kinda behaves like an elastic band?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 22:44:02 magnets maybe? idk im just talking out of my butt,im new to the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:18:39 is there no way to make the missiles go out one at a time without binding them to diferent keys?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:22:19 no i mean,i only want to deploy one at a time,so i press the button once,only one missile is activated,i press again,another is activated
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:23:14 i mean,you would expect that to be in the game to begin with
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:49:34 i spent 5 hours being brand new to the game making a plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:49:48 and its so sensitive and responsive its not useable
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 23:50:10 at least,not without native controller support
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:06:51 what does that do?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:07:46 man i dont even know what the anchor block actually does
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:07:54 does it anchor you to the ground?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:32:33 should i use wheels or cylinders with a motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:34:18 for an apc
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:34:26 want to make an M2 bradley
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:37:33 nvm ill just swap to using cylinders
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:37:46 theres collision between the tires
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:38:12 which is odd since collision is disabled
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 02:45:14 fine,ifv
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 04:40:04 
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 04:40:05 omg i can finally post pics
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 04:40:21 this is my first build
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 04:40:27 tried to do a pw mk1
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:08:58 
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:04 well,i ***tried*** doing this
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:29 im getting used to the controls
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:33 but my main gripe is
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:37 for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:52 vertical ailerons just dont fucking work like they should
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:09:59 they act like theyre normal wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:10:02 but jankier
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:10:04 alot jankier
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:10:45 also,for some reason,it just makes me bounce mid air whenever i let go of the vertical aileron
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:11:09 but other than that,its pretty good
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:11:23 ive been trying to replicate the weapon systems too
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:11:28 looks okay
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:12:11 so the pw mk1 has a rail gun, swarm missiles and explosive anti material machine gun rounds
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:12:28 i kinda did the swarm missile thing by adding all the missiles to my belly
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:12:43 i dont think ill be able to do the rail gun tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:03 also
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:06 missiles really suck
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:24 shot 12 missiles at a guys stationnary turret
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:37 they went probably 2 feet above his turret?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:45 they went right past him
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:13:49 tracking is terrible
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:14:08 this game really needs controller support so i can use gradual inputs
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:14:18 instead of being this jank fest
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:14:49 i tap my s key and my plane just does a backflip
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:15:19 while that is accurate to the pw mk1 in terms of capabilities, thats not useable
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:15:32 my plane NEEDS controller support
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:15:50 is plane crazy better on mobile?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:23:35 theres more then one?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:23:45 i started yesterday
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:24:17 i see
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:24:21 so pvp is trash
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 05:24:43 was trying to make a m2 bradley with the side mounted anti tank thing
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:56:40 
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:56:59 fucking
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 18:57:05 ***minecraft***
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 22:13:45 Could we get purpose built vertical  tail fins and control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 22:53:11 Because I dont want to play Tokyo drift lol
the-dump 2022-10-22 01:04:06 Tfw Halloween party
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 06:28:54 make meme plz
general 2022-10-22 19:14:27 i thought pc2 was releasing in the summer
general 2022-10-22 19:14:32 its fucking winter now
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 21:55:21 know what,i might make a kamikaze plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 21:55:44 can your own explosives blow you up?
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:02:55 damn,might be easier to kill people with a hypersonic nuke plane than with guns and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:04:02 yeah, but your normal combat jet isnt gonna be flying after getting struck by a nuke
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:04:11 i just gotta keep respawning
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:05:26 yeah,you can avoid anti air but can you avoid a plane that flies faster than you with better maneuverability?
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:05:31 the plane itself is the nuke
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 22:05:47 all its gotta do is bump into you or get near you
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 05:18:52 anyone here play project wingman?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:39:26 OH DEAR GOD
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:39:36 i think i may have made something completely broken
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:39:47 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:39:52 so,this works just fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:39:54 but
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:40:13 if you make the direction of the top propellers opposite of the one below it
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:40:22 the entire thing jibbs out
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:40:58 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:03 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:11 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:14 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:14 this
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:28 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:41:37 oh god it went to 4000
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:47:00 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:51:23 this is my only working creation
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:51:26 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:53:57 to be fair though,i only have 3 creations, 1 of which isnt even half built and the other i need to figure out whats going on
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:54:06 i spent 5 hours on that plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:55:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:55:17 at least, i tried to make it be that
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:55:19 its off
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:55:36 the front fins should be angled upwards
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 05:55:48 the vertical fins should be angled outwards
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:02:20 does anyone know if theres a bug currently that makes it so your creation loses a part?...
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:02:40 like,im talking a motor disappeared out of my build,its not there anymore
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:04:27 wait
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:04:29 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:04:51 not only did a motor dissappear,but an entire section of my plane reverted to an old design????
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 06:04:58 what the fucking shit?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:10:17 I keep getting woken up by wrong number calls what the fuck man
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 18:10:39 Every day for the past week
the-dump 2022-10-24 18:46:39 
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:26:54 hey how do i make tilted wings?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:33:22 hey baldy
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:33:45 look at the space between those eyes
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:33:58 are you a t rex?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:34:14 grunting with your arms like a furry?

plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:34:38 are you an elf?
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 22:34:56 das one ugly ass elf
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 23:51:58 anyone know why sometimes your creation randomly starts using voice acted engine sounds?...
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 23:52:10 its so annoying and ear rapey
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 01:39:02 bruhhh
