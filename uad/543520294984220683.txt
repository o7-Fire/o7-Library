general 2019-12-17 14:11:19 how come the turret on my big ass tank wont go up and down now? There are two max torque motors. It was working before and now its not. It cant even lift itself up... how do i fix this?
general 2020-01-18 05:56:55 YE KNO WHAT..... i think the devs should put a mirror plane option. So that you can focus on detailing one side of a creation.... and then just mirror it to the other side.
