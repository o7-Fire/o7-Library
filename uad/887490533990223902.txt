creations-chat 2022-03-07 23:53:02 thanks B)
creations-chat 2022-03-10 04:19:45 looks great apart from the tip of the nose and the canopy
creations-chat 2022-03-10 04:25:42 the angle locking on this is a bit off here and the trails are about 0.35 studs too high, and the transition from a half wedge down 1x2 to cylinders looks very unnatural, so piston lock the trails edit the angle locking on the nose and either try to make the entire thing more round or just make it more square.

<@!401530469952389130> my f5 isnt as advanced but if you want i can send a screenshot of it if you need any more help

creations-chat 2022-03-30 00:08:26 tanks are the most simple type of vehicle you can make, there arent too many complicated shapes in them but any that are a bit more complicated you can recreate with angle locking and or piston locking. for smaller details, at least on ro-scale tanks you can use emojis and symbols to get detailed tracks or like tools on the side of your tank.

+ aksuallly, it's the ah1w
creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:11:27 for better stability when flying foward

kind of, the blades on a helicopter do actually move around on a real helicopter

yes they flap up and down with the swashplate, but the swashplate is moved by the yoke. (for example going foward with a helicopter means tilting whichever blade is on the left of the helicopter down)

actually no, the pitch of the rotor blades controls the amount of lift, and the blade flapping is there to keep the helicopter stabile while hovering and to actually move around.

the flapping of the blades is controlled by the swashplate, sure they might bend a bit while in flight (not sure about this) but the general flapping of the blades is controlled by the swashplate and the yoke.

pitch of the blade is how much it's tilted to generate lift, flapping of the blade is how much it's pointed up or down (the blades on my "roscalr" ah1w are facing down via the closest thing i can get to blade flapping)
creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:19:41 (nerd argument)
creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:26:06 the flapping of the blades depends where the blades are, the blades will move up and down while they're spinning around.

idk

right?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:22:57 so if you realize you're wrong, why are you still trying to argue

this is why seats and safety features are important, people get jealous when they have a creation with no seats and no safety features and they can't transport things or people safely

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:35:41 tie raptor maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:35:46 beside the defender
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:36:07 tie hunter looks interesting too
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:36:25 ok i'll either do the defender raptor phantom or hunter sometime
creations-chat 2022-07-24 02:23:05 shitocopter
creations-chat 2022-07-24 05:50:30 i like it, it looks nice

also does it have passenger seats and other safety features? (it would be unsafe otherwise)

oh ok well can you add a seat on the back and explode everything but the base and add warning labels at least?

ok good thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-24 22:09:37 thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-24 23:45:02 hi ah1z or abf
creations-chat 2022-07-24 23:48:19 you're doing an ah1z too right?

ok i'll make that then
creations-chat 2022-07-25 00:17:56 screenshots once we're both done?

cobras are pretty easy, i've already done the ah1f and the ah1w so if you need any help just ask
creations-chat 2022-07-25 00:26:11 exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-25 02:02:34 angle and piston lock various wedges and cylinders

yes cylinders

angle and piston lock them to fill in the part above the half wedges (or just use more wedges)

yes

filling it in with another half wedge angle locked would probably be the best option looking at it again

ok
help 2022-07-25 02:21:50 if you're posting it in creations chat, yes. if you're posting it in creations, no.
creations-chat 2022-07-25 02:40:21 disconnector

<@984694509772357662> looks good

np
creations-chat 2022-07-25 03:04:10 the top or the bottom part?

yes disconnect the base
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:35:29 hi is this refueling probe good enough and if not how do i improve it

creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:39:04 how many parts of it are bad

oh ok thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:41:26 looks more like an apache so far
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:43:33 thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:45:49 oh it's just the lack of a gun that makes it look off

+ i think the parts on the bottom where it goes out look a bit too thick
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:47:53 here you go

i went to my private server since vip1 got too full for me, i'll go to vip2
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:49:55 yeah don't worry i'll remove those soon
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:52:16 looks good enough to me, i'm too lazy to completely redo the canopy so i'll just move on with it and hope it looks fine in the end
creations-chat 2022-07-25 07:55:38 i've also done helicopters for a while, ask me if you need any help too.
creations-chat 2022-07-25 08:07:07 yes it looks a bit better i think
creations-chat 2022-07-25 20:54:22 helimcopper,,
creations-chat 2022-07-25 20:56:26 to avoid exposed motors and to keep it simpler (plus i have no idea how to make it go to a half block)
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:01:43 still need to make a uh-1n to go along with the super cobra i made a few weeks ago
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:04:12 true
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:14:52 well i already have a very similar helicopter to take components from, mainly the canopy and engines

(my ah-1w)

because it's a super cobra, not a viper

yeah for the 4th of july

no this is something i made a while ago, my viper is still a wip
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:22:07 yeah the viper is just an upgraded super cobra

+ yes yours is a bit bigger
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:26:20 i think yours is closer to roscale

your seahawk is 3 wide, right?
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:30:17 wow that really is tiny
creations-chat 2022-07-25 21:38:08 that canopy <:nooo:787097964946259978>

creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:03:51 helimcopper,,

i need feedback
creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:06:31 unfortunately i'm out of sparklers since i have 2 layers of them for the tail, i'll add another brace to the gatling gun though
creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:08:34 just need to add the brace, make it fly, and paint it now

i am not slowing down üòé
creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:11:00 i already have the anti hit ground thing on the tail and angling the engines further out would result in exposed motors i don't have the space to fix, i'll try to add more electric countermeasure thingies though.

+ jet engines would add too much weight which i can't really afford since i'm doing a real rotor

and yeah i forgot that thing above the canopy, i'll add it rq too

thank you for the feedback, very helpful <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:41:30 it has a passenger seat ü•∞
creations-chat 2022-07-26 05:43:32 make a helicopter instead

creations-chat 2022-07-26 06:22:23 ok i'll add that on the bottom, thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-26 19:08:39 looks nice so far, i'm almost done with mine
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:59:07 i did 0.5 wide and 1 tall, mine is smaller though so idk

creations-chat 2022-08-08 02:10:46 that yoke looks very pointy and unsafe (add warning labels)

FALSE. it is very unsafe and you need to add warning labels
creations-chat 2022-08-08 02:19:51 WHAT

creations-chat 2022-08-08 02:22:15 üò®

plane-crazy 2022-08-09 06:14:13 i like it but can you add a few warning labels? (it looks very unsafe)

creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:17:49 oh ok which link works

just do -servers in bot central and you should get new links
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:08:25 my helicopter is the smaller one with the lighter colors
creations-chat 2022-08-11 00:51:35 can you add a few guard rails? (it has none which is a safety hazard)

oh ok i see them now, sorry
creations-chat 2022-08-11 05:58:00 <@746863511396810873> can you add a few guard rails around the bridge? (it is currently very unsafe and a big safety hazard)
help 2022-08-11 06:04:49 you should make a shrine dedicated to warning labels and other safety features
creations-chat 2022-08-11 07:12:32 does it have any safety features
creations-chat 2022-08-11 07:19:54 are there any seats
creations-chat 2022-08-11 07:39:53 that is a MASSIVE safety violation, please add seats immediately or else it would be very unsafe.
creations-chat 2022-08-12 19:27:52 can you add a few warning labels and ladders

hi aftersock52

why won't you add any safety features üò≠ (it is very unsafe)
creations-chat 2022-08-12 19:31:42 add safety features NOW. üò°üò°üò°
general 2022-08-15 21:42:10 you were an arrogant asshole from the moment i met you, i used that as loose justification to get rid of you.
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:15:19 it did not have any warning labels or other safety features üò≠

oh ok it must have been some other problem then (not enough warning labels)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:19:06 warning labels and other safety features are very important to making a good build (otherwise the build would be unsafe)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:21:31 i am safety specialist Solario ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and it's my duty in this server to make sure all relevant builds have proper safety features

üò≠
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:24:48 that is HIGHLY unsafe (add safety features NOW or just paint it a bright color since it's practically a large grenade)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:26:54 did yours have warning labels or no? i remember seeing it in vip1 once
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:29:04 yes orange is a very safe color

it would be safer but still not very safe
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:31:16 that would be VERY dangerous and unsafe and not good (unless you have proper safety features for it)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:33:20 you would need a seatbelt and very many warning labels
creations-chat 2022-08-17 19:36:05 can you add a few ladders and stairs and ramps to make it wheel chair accessible as well as a few passenger seats

ok can you do just a ramp and a passenger seat then
creations-chat 2022-08-18 01:50:52 does it have any warning labels?

hi adry

i might do an 8x8 someday too
creations-chat 2022-08-18 02:17:09 oh i forgot i tried to make that, it ended up being a fail sadly
creations-chat 2022-08-18 02:30:39 the warning label in the intake isn't very visible, can you add another one on the outside of the intake (otherwise it would be unsafe)

+ thank you ImHereForGam3
creations-chat 2022-08-18 02:43:58 warning labels and other safety features are crucial to avoid oopsies and uh ohs and oh nos and as safety specialist Solario ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è it is my duty to make sure that all relevant builds have proper safety features 
(otherwise they would be unsafe)
creations-chat 2022-08-18 02:47:41 safety features such as warning labels are very important üò≠
creations-chat 2022-08-18 03:13:25 impossible.. (i am safety specialist Solario ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è )

creations-chat 2022-08-18 03:22:18 hi pug, please leave me alone! ü§ó
creations-chat 2022-08-18 03:24:59 pug is the most narcissistic arrogant liar i've ever met and he just won't leave me alone
creations-chat 2022-08-18 03:30:39 never speak to me again üëãüòä
general 2022-08-19 05:01:01 no i havn't noticed that
general 2022-08-19 05:01:24 wow i
general 2022-08-19 05:02:01 i'll take that as an apology here
general 2022-08-19 05:02:16 truck gang
general 2022-08-19 05:02:29 exper designer is pretty easy
general 2022-08-19 05:02:36 i got it on day 3 of being in pcc i think
general 2022-08-19 05:04:12 pretty sure it was this that gave me expert
general 2022-08-19 05:04:37 ok i accept your apology
general 2022-08-19 05:05:30 i think you should have made the mixer 4 wide
general 2022-08-19 05:06:07 yeah your tgs looks great so far
general 2022-08-19 05:06:46 it's true üò≠
general 2022-08-19 05:06:53 i mean you one you're making right now
general 2022-08-19 05:07:18 make a man tgs NOW
general 2022-08-19 05:07:48 what
general 2022-08-19 05:08:03 how could you say such a thing doublewidesuprise_19 you have betrayed me..
general 2022-08-19 05:08:07 (my builds are very safe)
general 2022-08-19 05:08:50 YES
general 2022-08-19 05:08:54 ladders too
general 2022-08-19 05:08:55 and seats
general 2022-08-19 05:09:29 ok i'll list the ones on my safest build
general 2022-08-19 05:09:39 the rotor is foam so it doesn't hurt anyone at all
general 2022-08-19 05:09:51 there's a hidden very safe ladder to climb into the canopy
general 2022-08-19 05:09:52 yes
general 2022-08-19 05:09:58 nerf darts and nerf hydra rockets
general 2022-08-19 05:10:09 there's a warning label for the tail rotor
general 2022-08-19 05:10:11 one on each side
general 2022-08-19 05:10:17 no it's a very safe gun
general 2022-08-19 05:10:23 (it shoots nerf darts)
general 2022-08-19 05:10:29 and there's 4 beware of blast labels
general 2022-08-19 05:10:38 even a danger sign
general 2022-08-19 05:10:45 no plants are dangerous
general 2022-08-19 05:10:48 ah-1z
general 2022-08-19 05:11:10 it has 6
general 2022-08-19 05:11:26 i just ran out of sparklers for the outer rocket pods and missiles
general 2022-08-19 05:11:31 nor did i have the space for jet engines
general 2022-08-19 05:12:10 no don't worry is a very old nerf vulcan it's very weak
general 2022-08-19 05:12:17 (safe)
general 2022-08-19 05:12:28 fail!!!
general 2022-08-19 05:13:30 no safety features anywhere.. üò≠
general 2022-08-19 05:13:37 (DANGEROUS)
general 2022-08-19 05:16:17 no you can use them as warning labels
general 2022-08-19 05:16:19 just armed ones
general 2022-08-19 05:16:33 you wouldn't put your hand in a jet intake if there was an alligator
general 2022-08-19 05:17:43 but paper can make a papercut which hurts very much and is not good
general 2022-08-19 05:17:55 (dangerous)
general 2022-08-19 05:18:38 i think they should make foam jet engines because foam is very soft and doesn't hurt and that makes it safe
general 2022-08-19 05:18:58 how would a water jet work
general 2022-08-19 05:19:28 what if the motor stops if it detects a hand or a person
general 2022-08-19 05:20:52 paper is still very unsafe and i think jets should be made out of foam
general 2022-08-19 05:21:16 i am safety specialist Solario ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and it's my duty in this server to ensure that all relevant builds are safe and thus i am very safe
general 2022-08-19 05:21:31 but paper is very unsafe and i think it should be foam instead
general 2022-08-19 05:24:53 kind of
general 2022-08-19 05:25:05 depends on which truck
general 2022-08-19 05:25:18 my uhauls go ~100 sps and my fastest truck goes around 550 sps
general 2022-08-19 05:26:28 no don't worry my trucks are very safe
general 2022-08-19 05:26:43 they all have anchor blocks so i can instantly brake for extra safety
general 2022-08-19 22:08:15 no i unblocked him yesterday after he apologized
general 2022-08-19 22:08:47 can you replace it with a ladder (for extra safety)
general 2022-08-19 22:09:18 no shovels are for utility which is completely different from safety
general 2022-08-19 22:09:20 add a ladder
general 2022-08-19 22:09:34 ok good
general 2022-08-19 22:09:55 looks nice but it needs more warning labels
general 2022-08-21 04:23:39 hi
general 2022-08-23 01:06:14 make an MAN tgs instead of those
general 2022-08-23 01:06:55 typical of pug
general 2022-08-23 01:06:59 i very strongly dislike him
general 2022-08-23 01:07:19 no
general 2022-08-23 01:07:45 he's the most arrogant narcissistic and egotistical liar i've ever met
general 2022-08-23 01:08:20 he did apologize though so i have some respect for that
general 2022-08-23 01:12:38 looks nice
general 2022-08-23 01:13:14 no probably not
general 2022-08-23 01:13:23 idk actually
general 2022-08-23 01:13:38 true
general 2022-08-23 01:14:00 make a 2022 man tgs 35.510
general 2022-08-23 01:14:30 iveco maybe?
general 2022-08-23 01:15:22 maybe a mack pinnacle?
general 2022-08-23 01:15:52 i tried making it but i ended up overcomplicating it and making it impossible to spawn
general 2022-08-23 01:18:20 kenworth k270
general 2022-08-23 01:18:23 very unique truck
general 2022-08-23 01:18:25 pretty easy to make
general 2022-08-23 01:18:40 oh
general 2022-08-23 01:19:31 multicar fumo
general 2022-08-23 01:19:44 looks relatively easy
general 2022-08-23 01:19:53 and again very unique
general 2022-08-23 01:19:57 i've never seen anyone make it
general 2022-08-23 01:21:17 this one also looks doable
general 2022-08-23 01:21:22 daf xf
general 2022-08-23 01:21:26 2016 model i think
general 2022-08-23 01:22:04 no üòä
general 2022-08-23 01:22:11 mercedes citaro
general 2022-08-23 01:22:22 no motivation
general 2022-08-23 01:23:04 2022 MAN TGS 35.510
general 2022-08-23 01:23:05 (make NOW)
general 2022-08-23 01:24:18 it's pretty easy
general 2022-08-23 01:24:26 arocs
general 2022-08-23 01:24:33 motor piston and angle lock
general 2022-08-23 01:24:36 i've made a pretty similar one
general 2022-08-23 01:24:38 a 2022 man tgm
general 2022-08-23 01:24:41 4x2
general 2022-08-23 01:24:59 here
general 2022-08-23 01:25:09 it's very doable
general 2022-08-23 01:25:12 MANs are fun to build
general 2022-08-23 01:25:30 well if you ever do and need any help you can just ask me
general 2022-08-23 01:25:41 do it
general 2022-08-23 01:25:55 can you add a few warning labels
general 2022-08-23 01:25:59 (the guns look very unsafe)
general 2022-08-23 01:26:09 for extra safety
general 2022-08-23 01:26:23 warning labels are very important and very powerful
general 2022-08-23 01:26:32 ok
general 2022-08-23 01:26:32 yes they are
general 2022-08-23 01:26:39 how about guard rails
general 2022-08-23 01:26:48 guard rails are very safe and very powerful
general 2022-08-23 01:27:00 one of the best safety features aside from warning labels
general 2022-08-23 01:27:55 stairs and ladders and ramps for wheel chair accessibility are also very safe and good
general 2022-08-23 01:28:20 looks nice
general 2022-08-23 01:28:23 make it
general 2022-08-23 01:28:36 i don't even know what that is
general 2022-08-23 01:28:57 because i make MAN TGS trucks which are very safe and have solario approval üòé üôÑ
general 2022-08-23 01:29:19 oh that's good
general 2022-08-23 01:29:42 japan does not exist
general 2022-08-23 01:31:19 very safe but it looks like an international lt turned into a bus (ugly)
general 2022-08-23 01:32:07 yeah i don't like when an entire bumper is just pure chrome
general 2022-08-23 01:32:36 it looks kind of nice with that color
general 2022-08-23 01:33:09 citaro is still better though
general 2022-08-23 01:33:32 yes
general 2022-08-23 01:33:45 mercedes owns fuso though so mercedes is superior
general 2022-08-23 01:33:49 daimler ag
general 2022-08-23 01:33:53 they also own freightliner and western star
general 2022-08-23 01:34:07 i think they own multicar too
general 2022-08-23 01:34:19 yeah that's another market for them to break into
general 2022-08-23 01:34:44 and german reliability and german perfection and german design and just overall good
general 2022-08-23 01:35:21 i do kind of like the fuso fighter
general 2022-08-23 01:35:41 imo it's the only one that looks decent
general 2022-08-23 01:36:38 atego still looks better though
general 2022-08-23 01:36:45 (superior designer)
general 2022-08-23 01:37:04 what
general 2022-08-23 01:37:42 well at least the npr looks decent
general 2022-08-23 01:37:46 atego and tgl are better though
general 2022-08-23 01:37:47 no competition
general 2022-08-23 01:37:51 i like this
general 2022-08-23 01:38:04 other than the color
general 2022-08-23 01:38:08 awful green
general 2022-08-23 01:38:19 bro the gigamax is terrible
general 2022-08-23 01:38:28 tgx and actros clearly are better
general 2022-08-23 01:38:39 hyundai makes trucks?
general 2022-08-23 01:39:23 this looks awful though.. üò≠
general 2022-08-23 01:39:33 it just looks too tall
general 2022-08-23 01:39:58 man tgl is better
general 2022-08-23 01:40:04 (superior designer)
general 2022-08-23 01:40:50 isuzus look ok but i still prefer MAN and mercedes designs
general 2022-08-23 01:41:04 there's no competition between the isuzu elf and the ford e series cutaway though
general 2022-08-23 01:41:10 i actually like this
general 2022-08-23 01:41:17 that looks really nice
general 2022-08-23 01:41:29 ok üòä
general 2022-08-23 01:42:04 i think we can all agree that this looks horrible though
general 2022-08-23 01:42:07 peterbilt 537
general 2022-08-23 01:42:48 ford and freightliner both have much nicer box truck models
general 2022-08-23 01:42:51 especially freightliner
general 2022-08-23 01:43:30 this just looks good
general 2022-08-23 01:43:39 there's no denying it
general 2022-08-23 01:43:53 i like the mv and the rh but the lt and lonestar are awful, especially the lonestar
general 2022-08-23 01:43:55 older models idk
general 2022-08-23 01:43:59 9800 looks ok
general 2022-08-23 01:44:05 kw w900 is better though
general 2022-08-23 01:44:25 yeah looks fine
general 2022-08-23 01:44:49 i don't like many of the american cabovers but i especially like the mack cabovers
general 2022-08-23 01:44:57 looks really rough, not unlike your audi
general 2022-08-23 01:45:02 add safety features though
general 2022-08-23 01:45:41 not you.. üôÑ
general 2022-08-23 01:45:55 it looks really rough, there's still exposed lock and exposed pistons
general 2022-08-23 01:46:11 especially the tracks though
general 2022-08-23 01:46:31 it's a good angle but your turret and your tracks look really off
general 2022-08-23 01:46:50 i've seen some other pictures of it and it looks the exact same in all of them
general 2022-08-23 01:47:00 do a multicar fumo
general 2022-08-23 01:47:04 very unique truck
general 2022-08-23 01:47:21 1
general 2022-08-23 01:47:24 maybe 2
general 2022-08-23 01:47:30 1 would look better though
general 2022-08-23 01:48:15 infinite storage and space for seats and safety features.. ü§§
general 2022-08-23 01:48:23 yes 3 wide
general 2022-08-23 01:48:29 i think
general 2022-08-23 01:48:33 it looks like a 3 wide
general 2022-08-23 01:48:43 yeah shouldn't be hard to make
general 2022-08-23 01:49:33 MAN TGS 35.510 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-08-23 01:49:44 fix the turret and the tracks
general 2022-08-23 01:49:57 fr though make a freightliner m2 after the multicar fumo
general 2022-08-23 01:50:23 vehicles are good though
general 2022-08-23 01:50:44 this
general 2022-08-23 01:51:01 oh ok
general 2022-08-23 01:51:04 kw w900
general 2022-08-23 01:52:36 here

general 2022-08-23 02:04:39 freightliner ecascadia
general 2022-08-23 02:05:20 or the freightliner inspiration
general 2022-08-23 02:05:28 not too different from it
general 2022-08-23 02:05:35 i think it's still a concept though
general 2022-08-23 02:05:53 kw k270
general 2022-08-23 02:06:13 what
general 2022-08-23 02:06:19 
general 2022-08-23 02:07:13 or you can just do a ws 49x (superior)
general 2022-08-23 02:07:44 i only know the mercedes citaro and the solaris urbino when it comes to buses
general 2022-08-23 02:08:16 it needs more wheels shronei you just don't understand üò≠

plane-crazy 2022-08-23 03:53:58 he was probably talking to pug
help 2022-08-26 08:02:47 instead of weapons i think you should make it drop warning labels like bombs but nothing explodes and it's very safe
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:25:35 can you add warning labels and ladders and guard rails for safety (the turrets look very unsafe)
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:28:27 safety specialist Solario ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ?
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:29:16 i am famous now üò≥
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:29:21 bright orange
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:29:44 can you add a ladder so that the pilot can climb in
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:29:57 (otherwise the pilot might fall out and hurt himself)
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:30:29 maybe a ramp for wheelchair accessibility too
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:31:01 oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:31:15 or a pregnant woman
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:31:43 yes because it's too hard to get into and too unsafe
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:32:01 i think jets just need more safety features like warning labels and ladders and ramps and larger canopies
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:32:09 more jets should be like the f111 but a single seat just extra wide
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:32:33 and then lots more seats in the back so that there can be passengers
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:32:38 (you never know)
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:33:20 + i don't think there should be any missiles or bombs or gunpods or anything because we all know those are very unsafe and instead it should just drop things like warning labels
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:34:11 no it should be ok if you paint them bright orange and put some yellow reflectors on them
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:34:20 no trust me they're very unsafe
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:34:42 no warning labels can't be dangerous because they can just be a warning for themselves
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:34:50 ok good
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:35:26 no they are UNSAFE and BAD and they need to be replaced with SAFETY FEATURES.

plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:36:42 i am LEAVING because of this unsafe environment üò≠
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 09:37:39 oh ok they're safe then

bot-central 2022-08-30 11:07:27 -servers
creations-chat 2022-09-04 13:44:35 i like it but can you add a few warning labels and windows (otherwise it would be unsafe)
creations-chat 2022-09-04 13:54:20 oh ok add more warning labels to compensate for the windows then

warning labels are VERY serious and NOT a laughing matter. (they are for safety..)
creations-chat 2022-09-11 17:16:19 can you add a few warning labels (it looks very pointy and dangerous)
creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:12:58 add warning labels
creations-chat 2022-11-02 17:59:58 hi just making sure this looks fine before moving on to details

ok thank you

creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:31:23 wdym the bottom of the bow is entirely straight
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:34:40 this is a bulbous bow, a bulbous bow only applies to the part below the waterline which my build does not have.
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:36:48 my jet is better

9.5/10 (missing important safety features such as warning labels)
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:39:58 which part of the bow are you talking about, the top of it or the bottom?
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:43:23 a bulbous bow is only below the waterline, for the top i did the best i could to replicate the angles without overcomplicating it which means just a regular wedge and a half wedge down.
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:49:45 yes i was too lazy to angle it at the bottom, that's something slightly easier to do than the top though so i might still do that.

üëç
creations-chat 2022-11-03 19:39:56 i like it apart from the exposed motorlock tower but that's probably impossible to fix, pretty nice overall

creations-chat 2022-12-10 04:20:14 really though your jet has potential but there's a lot of spots i think you could have done better, mainly these 3 here
creations-chat 2022-12-10 04:22:35 already did üòä
creations-chat 2022-12-10 04:24:48 no it's a block too long actually
creations-chat 2022-12-10 04:27:12 wow
creations-chat 2022-12-11 05:44:30 that looks very unsafe please add walls and seatbelts
creations-chat 2022-12-11 06:30:14 no it's very unsafe trust me

if someone falls down then they will hurt themselves which is not good and can easily be avoided by adding walls and seatbelts, but that still leaves people being able to slip off the tires when they try to enter, so i think it needs stairs too actually, ramps would also be good for wheelchair accessibility.
the consequences of falling down would be very bad and it would hurt very bad and people would be very unhappy which is not good and idk something might even break or worse yet explode it's very big consequences actually and it would not be good at all.
so in conclusion it is VERY unsafe and you are WRONG and i am RIGHT and you should retract your statement immediately because i am safety specialist solario and i have determined your statement to be highly unsafe which is not good and very bad and it could mislead people into thinking the build might be unsafe.

hi <@614952074546774031>
creations-chat 2022-12-11 06:32:17 Iontached it would be very unsafe do not question me i am the safety specialist üò≠
creations-chat 2022-12-11 06:34:23 that is very true adryson it would be very unsafe and not good and people would get hurt which is very bad and as we all know that is not good but the solution is very simple and it is proper safety features including but not limited to warning labels stairs guard rails seats seatbelts walls doors and ramps for wheelchair accessibility
creations-chat 2022-12-11 06:38:00 that would be very safe but also very complicated which can become unsafe because of lots of moving parts and then something could explode and shatter and break and crack and it might just all break down and then there would be lots of shards on the ground which would be very unsafe for all lifeforms therefor it's better to just add adequate safety features rather than completely rebuilding it in a new scale
creations-chat 2022-12-11 06:43:14 i think the best option is just a very large build built out of very harmless and safe and good materials like fabric rubber and foam and every safety precaution possible including but not limited to warning labels doors walls proper floors support beams guard rails stairs ramps for wheelchair accessibility seats seatbelts airbags ceilings roofs headlights marker lights and the orange spinny lights on construction vehicles

+ ok byebye!!!
help 2022-12-11 21:05:28 you can make the hull but i found this ancient roman observation tower you can make instead of a turret (it's better)

creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:44:23 is it the trails themselves or mainly just the motors that cause the lag? i've had a series of failed builds that just become unspawnable halfway through building for months now and i'm trying to figure out why.

that's part of the problem i'm having, the main one is just my pistons failing. i'm really starting to think it's the trails since a common theme throughout my failed builds is 200+ trails.

plane-crazy 2023-01-01 08:34:54 = unspawnable
help 2023-01-02 05:09:35 i think you should fill it in with special armor plates for extra safety

(it does not look very safe)
help 2023-01-02 05:51:17 yes it could be so dangerous what if someone gets hurt!!! üò≠
creations-chat 2023-01-03 05:58:57 if possible i think you should add at least 2 warning labels for the nose or make it a softer material it looks very sharp and unsafe right now..
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:04:50 ok good thank you!!!
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:44:05 the control surfaces would look better if the nose cone would be as round

ok that's fair, i'd say stick with the half cylinders then
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:55:07 should i extend the jet engine shaft to fill in the corners of the nose cone or should i just leave it and move on to the next part?
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:59:52 make f16..

ok no problem
creations-chat 2023-01-04 02:54:09 the one on the right looks better
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:37:41 somehow idk
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:43:57 i'm serious though you do it somehow
creations-chat 2023-01-04 04:47:24 use rockets if you need any more thrust, use trails if you want it to look decent while moving, use snow pipes if you want it to look decent while stationary
creations-chat 2023-01-06 02:59:20 hi is this somewhat decent or do i need to improve it
creations-chat 2023-01-06 03:01:25 coming soon!!
creations-chat 2023-01-06 03:04:20 thank you
creations-chat 2023-01-06 03:06:22 thank you
creations-chat 2023-01-06 03:12:55 i'm not sure but i think it's a block 40 if i'm not wrong, this is what i'm using for reference and i'm just using the standard control surface intake.
creations-chat 2023-01-06 03:15:15 ok good i already thought i might have to remake the entire bottom half of the fuselage
creations-chat 2023-01-06 04:17:34 guard rails around the cupolas please..
creations-chat 2023-01-06 05:48:58 call it the TSE-1

creations-chat 2023-01-06 07:06:58 ok already working on that
creations-chat 2023-01-06 07:09:00 currently trying to find a way to hide the exposed trails
help 2023-01-06 07:21:53 build something else
creations-chat 2023-01-06 21:22:20 ok added the one part and changed the other around the engine
creations-chat 2023-01-06 21:24:27 i'm using the jet engine since it transitions to the intake more smoothly
creations-chat 2023-01-06 22:53:24 help please
creations-chat 2023-01-06 22:55:43 it kept going up past that

right now it looks like i can either have drop tanks or make the rear of the fuselage look somewhat decent

both together just breaks everything
creations-chat 2023-01-06 22:59:08 as far as i know that's just a roblox server problem, apparently 40 pistons is too much for a multi billion dollar company to handle
creations-chat 2023-01-06 23:02:35 oh ok thank you
creations-chat 2023-01-07 02:45:23 ok what livery do i do!!!
creations-chat 2023-01-07 03:10:55 that looks very good actually

ok i think i'll do that and just a standard grey one

ok sure that would be very helpful
creations-chat 2023-01-07 03:17:43 i appreciate the feedback but right now it's a bit of a pain to spawn and i just want to move on from it, i'll make the canopy better the next time i do an f16.

it already is a 1.5 wide
creations-chat 2023-01-07 03:26:06 i'll try this as well
creations-chat 2023-01-07 03:36:57 i think i'll do the greek one instead
creations-chat 2023-01-07 04:14:41 good or bad?
creations-chat 2023-01-07 04:20:30 oh ok i'll try to make it better the next time i do an f16, i already have a lot of other things i want to add and improve as well but right now it's a pain to spawn and i want to be done with it.
creations-chat 2023-01-07 05:43:02 yeah neut already pointed that out to me, it's too much of a bother to work on it anymore so i'll just improve it the next time i do an f16.

thank you though
creations-chat 2023-01-07 05:45:04 maybe..
creations-chat 2023-01-07 06:05:18 yes it didn't turn out too well, i'm planning to make it better on my next f16 though.
creations-chat 2023-01-07 07:19:01 i already know to improve it next time this is the 4th time please i already know üò≠
creations-chat 2023-01-07 22:40:48 requires at least 3 warning labels..
creations-chat 2023-01-07 22:43:08 np
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:32:56 looks ok so far
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:44:11 the length looks about right for the width but i think it might be a bit too tall, i also think the radome should be 2.5 or 3 long instead of just 2

+ you need to add the safety instructions on the sides as soon as possible..
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:47:20 the wheels look a bit strange
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:49:32 it's more about how they're mounted, i think you should being them a bit closer to the rest of the tractor and make axles and linkages instead of just having a single trail holding them on

the wheels themselves are ok and there's no simple way to fix them without sacrificing their functionality
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:51:47 oh ok sorry
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:55:14 using a regular jet engine shaft is probably the best way to replicate that
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:58:37 you can explode the exterior and the turbines of a jet engine leaving only the shaft with tnt, i have the settings you need here
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:00:40 you can probably just use a bit of motorlock to avoid that
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:02:53 you can use both pistons and motorlock for that, pistonlock is far more precise though. + it's no bother
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:05:05 a sparkler should work fine too, good luck
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:07:23 disaster.. üò≠
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:09:30 you can put 2 more regular glass wedges to fill that in and then pistonlock the corner wedges out 1 stud so that there's no z fighting
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:11:31 why wouldn't it?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:21:01 ok that looks nice now
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:40:02 should be good
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:09:39 ok pretty good for one day, screenshots once you're done?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:13:25 no i meant like a screenshot with your f16 and mine together once you've finished it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:15:30 add wings inside of the fuselage
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:17:37 ok i will be waiting
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:34:34 you need to move the front landing gear closer to the front of the intake
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:37:14 2 or 3 blocks i'm pretty sure
creations-chat 2023-01-08 01:44:05 anglelocked wedges should work

np
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:03:51 air vent?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:05:57 that's an intake, just use disconnectors instead of a wing panel at the bottom
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:08:09 close enough i think
creations-chat 2023-01-08 08:27:56 exterior of a water prop or jet engine and either a pyramid wedge or 2 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:07:45 you can explode the turbines of a jet engine or the propellers of a water prop using tnt leaving only the shaft and the exterior
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:14:25 oh ok
creations-chat 2023-01-08 22:47:45 ok very nice so far, i think you might need to make the intake taller though

creations-chat 2023-01-11 00:27:15 that's very true it is HIGHLY unsafe and i think i may just have to block him permanently because of how scary his ultralight is
creations-chat 2023-01-11 02:22:18 i know, that means you can add guard rails and windows to make it safe üòä
contest-chat 2023-01-11 03:17:11 the green one and the 2 gold ones
creations-chat 2023-01-11 05:27:20 i think it's worth making your build safer in order to avoid disasters like someone falling out which could hurt very much and it would not be good
creations-chat 2023-01-11 05:29:46 which one
creations-chat 2023-01-11 05:31:48 extend the 2 sections until there isn't a gap anymore or add another section to fill it in
creations-chat 2023-01-12 23:26:19 truck

oh it's too wide then, other than that it's nice
creations-chat 2023-01-12 23:32:48 make it 3 wide or make it 1.5 tall i think
creations-chat 2023-01-12 23:34:54 make the grill less wide or make it taller

also make the hood angled if you can
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:47:30 
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:56:39 do you know how to motorlock yet
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:58:44 you definitely can but motorlock just makes everything a bit easier
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:00:56 i recommend learning how to motorlock and getting a bit better at building before posting anything here
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:23:31 your f16 is somewhat tolerable but the screenshots you took don't really represent it too well, instead of robotic angles just showing a single side of your jet i recommend taking something more natural like this, beyond that there's a lot you can improve on the build itself but i've definitely seen worse as well.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:25:34 just in general
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:39:47 it looks the same
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:41:57 improve a few parts first like the canopy and fuselage, and then take new pictures. if you need any help you can just ask me.

<@883063424614006878> where?
oh sorry i see now
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:45:04 for the fuselage i think it needs to be a bit wider, i recommend just using half wedges for that. the canopy itself and the transition from the fuselage to the canopy and nose looks a bit rough, if you could improve all of that it would already look much better.

the vertical stabilizer also looks a bit off, that isn't too big of a deal to redo though.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:49:02 the wing panels already look proportionally correct, i think there needs to be more wedges leading to them though instead of it immediately just being completely flat if that makes any sense.

ok see how you can improve it, shouldn't be too big of a deal.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:24:59 already much better
creations-chat 2023-01-15 22:02:49 ok that's a massive improvement already, good job

just use a piston to reposition one of them and then it should be fine
