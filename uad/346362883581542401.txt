general 2021-03-11 22:56:06 <@!370594904268734464> luau is more an edit of lua

and real lua is just a weaker and slower version of roblox luau...
general 2021-03-11 22:56:24 although at-least u get access to some bytecode functions but most dont care
general 2021-03-11 22:57:59 its tuned much better
general 2021-03-11 22:58:02 compared to standard lua
general 2021-03-11 22:58:08 in its intepreter
general 2021-03-11 22:59:00 it runs better and more advanced bytecode design which is more specific to roblox needs meaning certain raw functions operate much faster.
general 2021-03-11 22:59:32 if you ever looked into the bytecode opcodes of standard lua vs luau you'll find that standard lua is actually pretty rough with its opcodes
general 2021-03-11 22:59:55 either way theres no point comparing them
general 2021-03-11 23:00:01 they are both for different purposes
general 2021-03-11 23:00:06 but in terms of rough stats
general 2021-03-11 23:00:08 luau is better
general 2021-03-11 23:00:46 i think we s hould be more specific about version numbers...
general 2021-03-11 23:00:56 im talking lua 5.1 vs luau which runs 5.1
general 2021-03-11 23:01:13 well then in your case your probably correct on most points
general 2021-03-11 23:01:45 real chads program in assembly 😎
general 2021-03-11 23:02:00 yeeeess
general 2021-03-11 23:03:27 lua is a bytecode intepreter meaning its like a hybrid between a compiler and an interpreter
general 2021-03-11 23:03:39 the compiled lua state is very similar to assembly code however when broken down
general 2021-03-11 23:03:53 you have similar instruction names
general 2021-03-11 23:03:59 and similar ways to move stuff around memory
