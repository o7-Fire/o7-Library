plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:44:47 never tasting anything as good

plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:46:48 if you want good food stop by a southern state
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:47:02 never eat British food
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:49:58 so i made this plane then i build a carrier around it when i spawn it all at base it flies normally but when i spawn it on water the controls are inverted and it does not behave the way it normally does how do i fix this?
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:50:32 any way to fix this?
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:51:22 no not really the controls would not be precise enough
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:51:34 i made the plane as a multirole for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:52:33 I've tried that on other aircraft but is there a way to make it not as sensative
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:53:03 ok I'll try it
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:57:56 <@!619312093962829849> so i decided on a different solution
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 23:58:04 i'm gonna make a land and sea based carier
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 02:02:33 my carier flies
general 2022-03-29 02:20:40 it doesn't say how to get image perms in <#925522972586967092>
general 2022-03-29 02:21:00 oh
general 2022-03-29 02:21:04 so i have to talk?
general 2022-03-29 02:21:18 so anyway
general 2022-03-29 02:21:24 i found this glitch yeah
general 2022-03-29 02:21:42 when i spawn on water my planes controls are inverted
general 2022-03-29 02:21:47 discovered no
general 2022-03-29 02:21:49 found yet
general 2022-03-29 02:22:02 i fixed this probelm by build a carier
general 2022-03-29 02:22:13 the carrier flies
general 2022-03-29 02:22:34 it flies very well
general 2022-03-29 02:23:02 it is the definition of death in the pvp servers
general 2022-03-29 02:23:11 it can launch exlosive drones
general 2022-03-29 02:23:15 and a multi role
general 2022-03-29 02:23:28 I'm telling you this to get to level 3
general 2022-03-29 02:23:41 idc
general 2022-03-29 02:24:31 i might even make a bomber to launch off this carrier to drop the guidable bombs i made
general 2022-03-29 02:25:05 whitelist when?
general 2022-03-29 02:25:22 OH GOD OH GOD IT'S CRINGE

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 02:27:04 i wanna see what the almost 8 thousand block vehicle you made
general 2022-03-29 17:14:17 Good evening
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 02:50:59 you guys got any cool guided bombs?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 02:52:02 you don't have guided bombs?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 02:54:28 it does take a bit more space but weight and drag can be handled
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 02:54:52 there are some more spaciouse designs i have come up with
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 01:58:57 the pvp game mode really sucks
