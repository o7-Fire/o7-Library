bug-reports 2020-11-20 21:04:12 Is it just me or are the locked motors disconnecting when you turn them, like I use locked motors so my tank turret doesn't get pushed around and when I turn the turret it pops off like I've been ammo racked
bug-reports 2020-11-20 21:04:50 Also whenever you press the keys to "turn" The motors after it has disconnected it will try and fuse back, flying across the map to reconnect
bug-reports 2020-11-20 21:05:07 It only connects when you are holding down the key, once you let go it disconnects
