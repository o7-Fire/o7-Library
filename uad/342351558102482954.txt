help 2021-05-24 23:16:29 Does anybody know how to create those hover pods that can fly around like they don't have physics?

plane-crazy 2021-05-24 23:40:10 OK THEN
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 23:40:20 While experimenting around with the helium and ballast
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 23:40:28 I found a way to yeet myself into the sky
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 23:40:56 Ye I didn't and now I have an infinite energy system
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 23:41:17 Constantly gaining speed while just flying into the sky
general 2021-05-24 23:46:24 Does anybody here know of those little hover pods that can fly around like they don't have physics

general 2021-05-24 23:54:06 I think I might just be stupid
general 2021-05-24 23:55:48 I think the things I was talking about is people with gravity slider
general 2021-05-24 23:56:28 This
general 2021-05-24 23:56:30 No
general 2021-05-24 23:56:48 A hell of a lot more stable than a normal hover thing
help 2021-05-25 00:02:07 No
help 2021-05-25 00:02:25 I think I was just thinking of people abusing gravity slider nvm

plane-crazy 2021-06-02 19:39:18 I originally just did mlock for guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 19:39:31 But I can get space inside if I remove the engines and mlock them
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:43:46 Goddamn they really need to do a poll or sth to patch/ban shredders
