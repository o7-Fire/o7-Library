plane-crazy 2022-03-13 18:16:04 okay so, super rocket engines on the front facing fowards or downwards
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 18:17:11 like this? <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 18:17:21 its the front

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:12:45 only issue i have with it is that it looks like a diamond in the front and im not about to redo the whole thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:34:30 its nearly perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:34:45 i just can't get it to move straight without moving downwards a tiny bit
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:34:59 but that won't affect performance a tiny bit
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 20:01:49 bro of course when i made my jet and it wobbled, this came out 💀 praise the gods

help 2022-04-18 16:18:34 rn its going down to the right
help 2022-04-18 16:19:02 yeah like this

help 2022-04-18 16:26:52 i removed all the helium on the left side and it tilts more to there
help 2022-04-18 16:27:17 thing is that i can't find the perfect amount

help 2022-04-18 16:53:57 broo this airship is so annoying i can't balance it at all
help 2022-04-18 17:27:52 the masses are this close together right?
help 2022-04-18 17:28:20 still tilts to the left even with helium
help 2022-04-18 17:28:27 and the more helium i add, its going to turn more to the right
help 2022-04-18 17:28:31 and i can't find a sweet spot
help 2022-04-18 17:30:01 i also tried using ballast blocks along with the helium blocks on the sides but for some reason it doesn't work
help 2022-04-18 19:05:03 bro finally i think my blimp works 😭
