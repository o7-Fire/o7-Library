The Tale of vkampf (784215019553292340)
general 2022-03-08 20:32:31 what
general 2022-03-08 20:34:44 I regret joining
general 2022-03-08 20:43:20 All the things everybody else makes are good but the things I make are like a jet that isn’t motorlocked so it’s not all realistic
general 2022-03-08 20:44:38 I don’t make motor locks because.. idk, I just like building things more normally
general 2022-03-08 20:54:43 Ew, that’s why I like making simple stuff
general 2022-03-08 20:55:22 true.
general 2022-03-08 20:55:39 but also I like making simple stuff cause it’s easier even if I knew
general 2022-03-08 21:00:07 I cant even get a role from my builds cause 2 things, 1 my plane is often inside a hangar, not connected to the hangar, and also there are 2 fuel blocks with helium connected that fly off when I spawn
