plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:41:25 like is there a way to convert it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:41:40 lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:42:28 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:42:34 ugly

creations-chat 2020-02-12 00:44:14 Oh yeah, forgot to mention, but my friend made the engines for the Blackbird
creations-chat 2020-02-12 00:44:18 The rest I did
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:46:29 oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:46:38 so apparently if 20 studs is a meter
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:46:42 then my blackbird goes mach 932
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:46:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:46:59 its in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:18 unfortunatley at about that speed it destabalizes
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:28 but below that it flies fine
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:32 ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:34 whats that
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:36 ingame speed?
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:44 yeah ik savoic
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:47:57 if i did the calculations right then its real fast
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:48:11 wow ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:48:14 lilundr thats uh
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:48:16 way better than mine
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 00:48:23 im bad at plane crazy lol
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:19:19 Subnautica Snowfox, simulated hovering, controls well but looks kinda crappy
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:31:55 bruh i dont understand this disc
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:32:02 so i post a crappy snowfox
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:32:12 and it gets 6 upvotes and no downvoted
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:32:18 and yet i post builds which i think look nice
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:32:23 and they get downvote bombed
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:33:37 ew pewdiepie
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:36:44 aw man r u kidding me
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:36:47 i jusst realised
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:36:52 i could've gotten the sub commander rank
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:36:59 but i DELETED IT
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:37:03 before i joined
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:37:11 F to 5.5k block sub that almost crashed my game
creations-chat 2020-02-13 00:40:38 and no im not making a new one
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:41:44 For aeronautical engineer, does it count as "use only wings to fly" if you use conveyor engines for thrust? What about using jet engines for faster pitch / yaw / roll?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:49:31 well yeah, but conveyors on their own generate lift somehow
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:49:34 so thats why i was confused
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:50:22 no like, if you smack a conveyor engine on a car, it flies, so I was wondering if using conveyors would disqualify it for "only" wings
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:51:43 What about using jets for pitch/yaw/roll?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:52:41 ah ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:54:01 thats what i thought
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:54:15 but the plane, although capable of flight without those extra engines, controls incredibly slowly
help 2020-02-13 00:59:16 Aero engineer II pls? tell me if i need more proof of it functioning
help 2020-02-13 00:59:20 
help 2020-02-13 00:59:23 
help 2020-02-13 01:02:11 ah ok
help 2020-02-13 01:02:37 
help 2020-02-13 01:02:37 here
creations-chat 2020-02-13 01:09:33 First attempt at a multi stage rocket, looks ugly as hell but works pretty splendidly
creations-chat 2020-02-13 01:09:42 Seperation
creations-chat 2020-02-13 01:09:58 Stage 2, super ugly, but building in the nose cone was hell
creations-chat 2020-02-13 01:10:08 Yes it can land
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:20:37 whwat
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:02 hm
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:03 no
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:05 wrong file type
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:07 thanks videopad
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:10 lets try that again
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:26 oh and the real file is too big
the-dump 2020-02-13 01:30:29 thanks discord
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:34:26 oh god <@!505835349889777685>  that conveyor drive is huge
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:34:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:35:04 mine is only 2x2x1
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:35:12 (height length width)
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:35:37 sure but it aint really my design
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:35:46 lemme open plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:37:13 Red block isnt needed, that was just to lift it up so its easier to see
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:37:45 bind the piston to a key u wont press
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:37:50 bc if the piston turns on it breaks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:38:22 thats a pretty heli
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:38:35 I tried to make a heli
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:38:38 it looked great
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:38:40 but it didnt work at all
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:38:44 ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:39:19 doesnt really matter
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:39:26 if u get it wrong u just gotta reverse the controls
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:39:42 it just has to be fowards / backwards
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:39:45 sideways doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:39:55 ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:01 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:04 they'
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:05 oop
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:08 they're really fast
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:37 if u ever make one, and it isnt working, make sure the conveyor doesnt touch anything else
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:40:44 it can touch the piston but nothing else
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:41:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:41:52 probably
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:41:57 u can turn down the speed on the conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:03 and it'll make it less insane
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:09 5 is roughly 120
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:22 60 accellerates to 20k
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:24 oh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:25 weird
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:29 guess it depends on the vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:33 ah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:34 thats why
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:49 you probably wont need the helium
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:55 it could make my 5.6k block sub fly
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:42:59 with just the drive
general 2020-02-13 02:44:12 <@!454570394343702529>  wdym it "cant be vertical" I've used vertical conveyor engines just fine
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:49:47 honestly same
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:53:06 god my voice used to sound so fucking deep
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:53:09 now it's gone all wonky
the-dump 2020-02-15 18:25:49 Guys look at this original meme i gound
the-dump 2020-02-15 18:28:01 Mine's obviously superior

help 2020-02-17 19:38:22 Do subs count towards the shipwright rank?
help 2020-02-17 19:38:39 thanks
help 2020-02-17 19:38:39 aight
help 2020-02-17 19:38:49 I was just wondering since theres also a sub rank
creations-chat 2020-02-17 20:24:23 Subnautica Cyclops (Front)
creations-chat 2020-02-17 20:24:31 Cyclops rear
creations-chat 2020-02-17 20:25:01 Engine room, the whole sub is decorated but this is the only one where i could get a good camera angle
creations-chat 2020-02-17 20:25:08 Submersion
help 2020-02-17 20:25:47 Submarine commader pls?
help 2020-02-17 20:25:52 
help 2020-02-17 20:26:32 Also shipwright 2
help 2020-02-17 20:27:07 <@!340543153922768906>
help 2020-02-17 20:27:26 Its less flat than it looks
help 2020-02-17 20:27:28 the angle was bad
help 2020-02-17 20:27:37 but it is still pretty flat
help 2020-02-17 20:28:05 
help 2020-02-17 20:37:34 hm
help 2020-02-17 20:37:37 didnt get shipwright
help 2020-02-17 20:48:37 its k
help 2020-02-17 23:36:44 dont use conveyors to turn
help 2020-02-17 23:36:49 its a horrible idea and never works
help 2020-02-17 23:36:59 only ever use them for forwards / backwards and up / down
help 2020-02-18 03:03:35 you could do a really unconventional method and use downwards facing wheels
help 2020-02-18 03:03:39 with steering off
help 2020-02-18 03:03:57 so you have a 2nd set of wheels under neath bound to A and D
help 2020-02-18 03:04:08 when the wheel spins, aslong as its touching the ground it'll turn the tank
help 2020-02-18 03:04:19 its compact
help 2020-02-18 03:04:24 but idk how well it works for big builds
help 2020-02-18 03:04:31 I've only ever used it as a concept
help 2020-02-18 03:04:44 the only time i've ever used it was in a 12 block concept build
help 2020-02-18 03:04:45 so
help 2020-02-18 03:04:56 but it might work
help 2020-02-18 03:04:58 give it a shot
help 2020-02-18 03:12:13 yo wth
help 2020-02-18 03:12:21 why do that
help 2020-02-18 03:12:41 revenger i wanna join you bc i need to see this ingame

bug-reports 2020-02-22 06:39:11 no clue whats happening
bug-reports 2020-02-22 06:39:15 
bug-reports 2020-02-22 06:39:23 these are from roughly the same timeframe
bug-reports 2020-02-22 06:39:32 on my pc the spike doesnt drop and he's walking sideways
bug-reports 2020-02-22 06:39:36 on his screen it dropped
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:03:41 crap i just realised i forgot to take a screenshot of the f9 menu
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:03:44 And now my pc is off
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:04:14 No, because somebody else ingame experienced it too
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:04:34 And it wasnt for a breif timeframe, it happened every time i spawned and dropped the spike
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:04:59 Strangely, he and the other person who saw the spike dropped were both on mac
bug-reports 2020-02-22 07:05:17 Me and my friend who were on PC saw it stay up
the-dump 2020-02-27 16:15:09 wow this server really hates furries huh
the-dump 2020-02-27 16:20:07 i mean im not a furry but theyre just people yall dont have to go commit hate crimes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:22:50 GUYS
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:23:15 i've only been messing with hovers for a few mins and i found a way to make a hover engine
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:23:19 but unlike conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:23:24 you can throttle up n down
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:23:30 so its alot more useful
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:23:34 just not as fast sadly
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:25:04 oh y'all already found that out?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:25:05 darn
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:25:11 as i said literally just got on
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:25:14 so i didnt know
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:26:48 yea thats what i found
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:26:52 also works with suspension
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:27:05 suspension isnt as good
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:27:08 but works
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:27:12 how tf you reach 4k tho?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:27:17 i only manage about 1.2k
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 00:29:00 slow that only gets me about 400
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:04:07 wdym 5th grade
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:04:19 im almost in high school and we still havent been tought jack about aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:07:02 Guess not where I live
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:07:17 or maybe its taught in english track but not french
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:07:22 which would be the dumbest thing ever
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:07:40 We're only just learning about how cells work in gr. 8 which is depressing
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:12 where are you from?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:25 Canada
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:30 hm
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:40 maybe with some clever pistons
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:44 not quite sure tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:55 yea
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:58 but its worth a shot
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:31:08 i'
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:31:12 i've made a player detector
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:18 I have a blackbird that can reach 16k speed
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:24 only using conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:53 I discovered a thing tho, whenever a player moves infront of this it flies away
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:09 Noc what design is it
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:12 piston?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:25 the piston one only reaches like 20k tops for me
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:28 then reality collapses
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:36 ryeo the huge double one sucks
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:45 the piston engine is bugged
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:54 so your came almost crashes if its not active
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:35:08 lots and lots of engines
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:35:12 bc conveyors cant turn
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:35:48 Ryeo do you know how to make the piston design?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:36:22 this
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:36:23 
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:36:35 use that instead of the dual
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:36:51 just make sure the conveyor doesnt touch anything
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:36:54 dunno
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:37:00 noc i think urs moves faster
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:37:06 also its not really my design
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:37:08 somebody showed me it
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:37:21 noc whats ur design?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:38:35 wth
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:38:39 that thing looks wack
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:38:52 yea
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:02 i dont even think i can fit that in my Sr-71 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:07 its too wide
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:20 ik
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:26 using multiple conveyors is scary
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:33 especially if you use them to turn
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:45 if you use two with the design i sent
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:46 they like
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:48 fight eachother
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:50 and you get flung
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:39:57 and if your build folds usually ripped apart
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:42:00 i think the grey should be slightly darker
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:42:04 and the red less saturated
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:42:56 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:42:58 in that case
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:43:00 the grey needs more blue
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:43:02 and darker
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:43:10 and the red needs to be darker and less saturated
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:43:16 but only slightly
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:43:31 also i just found another more compact player detector
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:46:10 well if you dont wanna repaint the whole thing thats understandable
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:46:25 thats fair
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:47:43 try 255, 50, 50
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:47:50 i think i might have it slightly closer but idk
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:47:56 wait i didnt mean 255 lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:48:05 i meant 230
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:48:10 it seems correct to me
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:48:18 guess ur in different lighting or something
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:48:38 to me it dont
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:49:05 oh right my monitor is at lowest brightness
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:49:10 i keep forgetting about that
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:53:27 that looks good
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:00:47 god im so close to making an auto fire missile but im stuck on one thing'
help 2020-03-02 02:01:34 Can somebody help me with an auto fire missile
help 2020-03-02 02:01:40 i've almost got it working
help 2020-03-02 02:01:50 but im stuck on one thing
help 2020-03-02 02:03:30 sorry for bad writing my hands shaky as hell
help 2020-03-02 02:04:18 Whats happening is the tnt in the middle is set to auto explode
help 2020-03-02 02:04:31 and whats meant to happen is when the PD hits the tnt it blows up, allowing the missile to fly out
help 2020-03-02 02:04:39 but the middle tnt wont explode
help 2020-03-02 02:04:43 unless hit by the missile
help 2020-03-02 02:05:07 it has more force than the missile
help 2020-03-02 02:05:10 it goes REALLY fast
help 2020-03-02 02:05:15 also impact speed is at minimum
help 2020-03-02 02:05:33 the missile going like 2 speed sets it off
help 2020-03-02 02:05:41 it isnt glitching into it tho
help 2020-03-02 02:06:55 ok this is weird as hell
help 2020-03-02 02:06:56 so
help 2020-03-02 02:07:01 when I set off the player detector
help 2020-03-02 02:07:03 it doesnt blow up
help 2020-03-02 02:07:08 it does
help 2020-03-02 02:07:08 but when my friend sets it off
help 2020-03-02 02:07:12 so i guess its working??
help 2020-03-02 02:10:28 ok so it ONLY works if im sitting down
help 2020-03-02 02:10:33 otherwise the tnt just doesnt explode
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:10:41 i got it working oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:10:48 it kind of sucks
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:10:49 but it works
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:03 here it is
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:08 
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:13 Basically, whenever somebody goes infront of it
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:17 the middle tnt explodes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:26 and the missile in the back flies forward and hits them
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 02:14:42 fully automatic process for firing but it does have a bit of a hassle to load

help 2020-04-18 05:32:32 all i had to do was make it not servo
help 2020-04-18 05:34:45 the difference is motor 2 fucking sucks
help 2020-04-18 05:36:57 i was using servo
help 2020-04-18 05:37:01 which is key based
help 2020-04-18 05:37:14 but apparently it doesnt work at all
help 2020-04-18 05:37:18 and just decided to give up
help 2020-04-18 05:37:23 so i replaced it with motor 1
help 2020-04-18 05:37:27 and now its only sort of broken
help 2020-04-18 05:37:39 it can turn which is a massive improvement but it gets stuck on literally nothing
help 2020-04-18 05:38:12 wait nvm its getting stuck on an anchored block i didnt see

help 2020-05-09 22:55:07 https://streamable.com/4wby25
help 2020-05-09 22:55:13 there, this time it pitched to the left
help 2020-05-09 22:55:17 but its the same issue
help 2020-05-09 23:00:38 The weird thing is is that on a previous version of the craft that didnt include the top it was just fine
help 2020-05-09 23:00:48 the only difference in the old version is theres no top
help 2020-05-09 23:02:41 the Com is on the bottom
help 2020-05-09 23:02:53 like its almost below the rockets
help 2020-05-09 23:03:03 also i added more weight on the bottom and it just reversed the problem
help 2020-05-09 23:03:07 now legs up is fine
help 2020-05-09 23:03:11 legs down is impossible to fly
help 2020-05-09 23:04:02 yea
help 2020-05-09 23:04:07 well it doesnt flip on its own like it used to
help 2020-05-09 23:04:11 but a light angle
help 2020-05-09 23:04:15 like about 3 degrees
help 2020-05-09 23:04:21 and it just goes upside down completely
help 2020-05-09 23:06:32 now if it goes forward a little bit it violently swings backwards and starts doing backflips
help 2020-05-09 23:09:44 made it worse
help 2020-05-09 23:10:06 this thing is kind of a disaster i might just scrap it and go back to the old one that works

plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:33:26 man a copy paste feature would be REALLY FUCKING NICE RIGHT NOW
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:33:48 spent 2.5 hours making the back of my lan evo, but whoops! it's completely fucking unusable because its a single block off
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:46:09 Exo its a fold that wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:53:26 Ive been trying to for the past 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:53:37 No matter what the placement means that it cant fold
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:54:41 i tried
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:54:43 like
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:54:47 80 placements
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:55:12 Then it wouldnt close
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:55:22 Since the extra motors would be in the way
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 07:55:52 I closed plane crazy but its just a stupidly bulky 180 fold

help 2020-06-07 05:06:27 any idea how i could get my clutch to work?
Yellow = Engine input
Pink = Flywheel
Blue = Clutch engagement system
Teal = Output (To transmission)
Green = unpowered motor
Purple = powered motor
help 2020-06-07 05:06:53 the issue im having is that the blue section cant turn when it engages with the flywheel, because any method I have of keeping it in place prevents it from rotating

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:43:05 atleast on signs they did
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:43:32 but if it's still working you literally just search what the emoji is and then highlight it, CTRL C CTRL V

I've got a huge build (almost 19,000 blocks lmao) that I wanna post, and because it's a building just images would show you like, 2% of the build, so is it okay to upload a video in the creations channel? (I don't wanna send like 40 images because that'd just be spam)
general 2021-01-30 04:43:11 would links work in the channel though?
creations-chat 2021-01-30 05:27:00 accidentally posted an image without the caption in creations im a 🤡
i hit enter thinking it'd make a new line but it just posted it xd
creations-chat 2021-01-30 05:37:39 lots of motors aswell as pain and suffering
help 2021-01-30 05:47:51 Does it use servos for the control surfaces?
help 2021-01-30 05:49:53 in that case then it's probably needing more delta wings for stability
help 2021-01-30 05:50:06 if that doesnt help then it's likely the servos on the back being funky
creations-chat 2021-01-30 08:14:34 use fabric tyres
not for appearance or anything it just works better
do you use engines to drive (rockets n shit) or motors
no idea why its worse then lol
also it looks nice
help 2021-01-31 04:16:12 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> mfw no 1x1 propellor blade

help 2021-01-31 04:28:53 nvm found a way around it it's just ugly
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:28:16 why are people downvote bombing this? it's not bad, or is it a tutorial / copy or something? https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/805289068069388308
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:38:20 at the very least it's got a proper deck, i've seen builds way worse than this get more upvotes but okay i guess
bug-reports 2021-01-31 08:28:07 Suspension beyblades (Where you place a block with 4 suspensions on the sides, set to 100 stiff, 0 damp, 0 length, causing it to spin rapidly) for some reason cause the build owner's ping to skyrocket the longer they've been spawned. This ping was reached after having 4 of them spawned for about 10 minutes. Movement worked fine on my end, however things like dying, jetpack, and chatting had to wait the full ping delay to go througg.

bug-reports 2021-01-31 23:24:05 It only affects the one who built it, and the longer it's spawned the worse it gets.

help 2021-02-01 02:19:08 ...i did
help 2021-02-01 02:19:23 it doesnt say where you're meant to ask for a rank
help 2021-02-01 02:19:37 it mentions a command for bot central but the wording for that sounds like asking for the mods to add a new rank
creations-chat 2021-02-13 23:30:04 genuine question: why did people like my album art, which i did in an hour, more than my facility which took a month, what did the album art have that the facility didnt?

creations-chat 2021-02-19 01:21:49 mine do you have speakers, if so try and get some audios to add, sound can really help bring a build to life
creations-chat 2021-02-19 01:24:43 well thats a shame, i wish speakers werent locked behind a paywall because theyre so useful in helping builds have atmosphere and generally feel better
creations-chat 2021-02-19 01:32:40 you can just blacklist people who abuse speakers, plus its not like the gamepass prevents people from abusing them, ive met countless people ingame who spam bypassed audios and bought the gamepass specifically to do that
creations-chat 2021-02-19 01:35:13 again, just blacklist them, it takes like 2 seconds

help 2021-03-16 21:48:53 anybody know how I can fit a landing gear into the yellow spot which folds in the direction of the red arrow into the plane? (There is room inside of the fuselage, but it's limited due to the cabin being right above) I've been trying for a week to find a way to do it
help 2021-03-16 21:52:03 yes thank youvery helpful
help 2021-03-16 21:53:11 the issue is fitting the landing gear into the fuselage in a way that doesnt look awful
help 2021-03-16 21:53:16 not connecting the gear to the wing
help 2021-03-16 21:54:51 also any feedback on the general shape? (yes i know there are exposed motors everwhere, I'm trying to fix that) it's meant to be an a321
help 2021-03-16 22:01:55 thank
help 2021-03-16 22:07:17 you cant
help 2021-03-16 22:07:29 you can make wing panels out of every material EXCEPT glass because rickje hates us
help 2021-03-16 22:07:47 you can use glass signs if you need to
help 2021-03-16 22:12:15 its possible it was just glass signs that got motorlocked into the middle of the block
help 2021-03-16 22:12:30 atleast thats my best guess
help 2021-03-16 22:12:53 also sidenote is rick ever going to fix fabric wing panels and their tendency to obliterate reality?
creations-chat 2021-03-16 22:17:34 <@!767968165363449877> 0/10 too many pixels for a ufo sighting, it should be a completely discernible blob of white light
(in all seriousness, clever build, is cool)
help 2021-03-16 22:25:55 yeah ive got no idea then
help 2021-03-16 22:26:02 i havent seen the build so i dont know
help 2021-03-16 22:42:28 yeah i agree, havent really found much of a work around though (if youre talking about the wings, wing panels on their own didnt look right, waaayy too skinny, half blocks didnt allow for good angle, so i went for full blocks.) (this was a reply to hars whoops)
help 2021-03-16 22:43:55 the fuselage is taller than fat, and the engines looked awful unless i made them that chonky
help 2021-03-16 22:48:34 not enough planes imo

creations-chat 2021-03-17 02:24:08 they have an a321neo so close enough
well not yet but soon

rae the cabin is 3 blocks wide how am i supposed to fit anything more its already cancerous to walk through as youre constantly jammed into a seat every 0.1 second
creations-chat 2021-03-17 02:30:04 nubs would be popping out all over and ive already got a fair share of those
plus i have no idea what else to put in there, i already have the two galleys at the front and back i just didnt show them, and there are the stowaway trays in the economy class
creations-chat 2021-03-17 02:32:58 cant, if i painted it any other colour then half the outside would be the wrong colour since it isnt double layered
and im not using paint blocks those things are god awful
creations-chat 2021-03-17 02:35:12 additional wing panels would add too much drag (it already has a metric fuck tonne of them) but otherwise that could work, i just dont know if its worth all that work just to have a white interior instead of a teal one
creations-chat 2021-03-17 02:41:46 troll
creations-chat 2021-03-18 04:47:43 yeah
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:18:08 anything i should add? (other than paint and furniture inside) this is my first time making a house and im feeling like the outside is a bit barren
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:22:22 so have the thatched part overhang above the outside? okay, that shouldnt be too hard
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:30:46 there are windows, i just forgot to get them inframe because i am an IDIOT
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:32:48 thank you grablador, was this what you meant with the roof btw?

yeah i agree
creations-chat 2021-03-22 04:05:30 this isnt painted, but does anybody have some tips on how to make trees that dont look like dogshit cause... yeah.

plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:19:46 im starting to regret my building decisions
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:20:56 i started that build back in uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:20:58 december
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:42:50 if i could cram that many in there, i would
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:43:09 i mean theoretically i could comb through the ENTIRE build replacing every beam with individual blocks and that'd probably do it
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:43:17 but that would take a long, long time
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:43:28 also its got a lot of wedges that arent in beams already so that might not even be enough
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:50:46 i posted it back in like january in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 06:50:51 back then it was only 19k but ive made some updates

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 00:23:45 you can just select a material before you place it and it bypasses the limit
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 00:23:50 infact it actually increases the limit
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 00:24:10 on my scp facility i think i have like 9000 blocks placed
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 00:24:15 as in like, 1x1 default blocks
general 2021-04-06 06:04:42 well obviously it isnt to scale you goober
general 2021-04-06 06:09:09 ah yes because i got the hull slightly wrong the entire 8200 block build that took 4 days to make is worthless, man this server makes me question my faith in humanity sometimes
help 2021-04-09 06:37:56 This is an old message im replying to, but since we know ingame speed is in sps, we can easily turn that into m/s, then we can take how many blocks we travel in 1 second to get how many blocks per second we were going, if we know our original speed in m/s we can then translate m/s to b/s, drop the /s, and get the length of a block, which when i did this a couple years back i worked out to be 0.7 meters, incase you still wanted to know.
general 2021-04-27 05:42:24 hey guys
general 2021-04-27 05:42:32 remember that 20,000 block scp facility i made

general 2021-04-27 05:59:28 just to see how horrifically he's messed it up
general 2021-04-27 06:00:12 this is his profile incase anybody is wondering https://www.roblox.com/users/1734116344/profile
general 2021-04-27 06:00:16 he's only done like
general 2021-04-27 06:00:18 the first little bit
general 2021-04-27 06:00:25 and he's already messed up big time
general 2021-04-27 06:00:54 1) forgot the 2nd door
2) used the wrong wedges on the walls
3) used the wrong material on the walls
4) didnt put the glass window for the nameplate
general 2021-04-27 06:01:02 also yes there is 1 motor lock hidden away somewhere\
general 2021-04-27 06:01:07 and this poor bastard is never going to find it
general 2021-04-27 06:01:19 even if i leave my build there for months
general 2021-04-27 06:01:26 not to mention the numerous easter eggs
general 2021-04-27 06:01:33 although to be fair i dont think he's trying to directly copy
general 2021-04-27 06:01:47 just be "heavily inspired" (i.e. copy all the key parts)
general 2021-04-27 06:02:36 i actually told him he forgot the 2nd door and messed up the walls
general 2021-04-27 06:02:38 but he ignored me
general 2021-04-27 06:02:39 xd
general 2021-04-27 06:02:52 OH I GOT BACK IN
general 2021-04-27 06:03:24 oh he's already given up and started a new build
general 2021-04-27 06:03:25 wow
general 2021-04-27 06:03:50 maybe
general 2021-04-27 06:03:52 lets see
general 2021-04-27 06:03:55 i loaded the build in too
general 2021-04-27 06:04:00 oh my god
general 2021-04-27 06:04:02 the resolution
general 2021-04-27 06:04:11 4 whole pixels
general 2021-04-27 06:05:25 this is literally all he has done on his new build
general 2021-04-27 06:05:30 watch this one ends up being a tutorial or something
general 2021-04-27 06:07:24 im dming him in game
general 2021-04-27 06:07:30 he said he gave up because it "didnt look good"
general 2021-04-27 06:07:37 which is either a lie or insulting my build xd
general 2021-04-27 06:07:48 and then i asked why he thought coping a 20k block build would work and he just said "i didnt"
general 2021-04-27 06:07:55 followed by
general 2021-04-27 06:07:57 "am pro"

general 2021-04-27 06:24:22 injured
general 2021-04-27 06:24:27 whats the dimensions of the chassis
general 2021-04-27 06:24:36 cause you could use an actual suspension
general 2021-04-27 06:24:48 like not just single block
general 2021-04-27 06:25:41 5 wide is wide enough
general 2021-04-27 06:25:45 wait
general 2021-04-27 06:25:48 does that include the wheels
general 2021-04-27 06:26:39 okay yeah thats wide enough
creations-chat 2021-05-07 06:55:49 yeah and also not "realistic"
creations-chat 2021-05-07 19:46:33 the colouring on the guns doesnt fit in that well, too undersaturated and imo too bright
general 2021-05-09 17:33:47 wow the mods are real petty huh, so 1M3G4 posts a build in the contest (the funny fish) it got disqualified for being considered pixel art, despite being in 3D and having wedges. When I made a build back in februrary that was ACTUALLY 2D it got disqualified from the pixel art rank for having wedges in it, and when i point out this idiotic double standard i get a warning and banned from <#609381270237216768> <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> pcc mod team is incredibly fair

Oh and they disabled my ability to read the chats previous messages so I can't even read the mod response <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-05-10 05:49:13 ohmy god
general 2021-05-10 05:49:16 i did it
general 2021-05-10 05:49:23 i killed my pc using a plane crazy build
general 2021-05-10 05:49:45 i spawned my 20,000 block facility and it shut down and now wont turn back on <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-05-10 05:50:24

creations-chat 2021-06-08 04:50:05 i use motorlock in almost all my builds and honestly everybody should, cause the ingame block selection is frankly awful
help 2021-06-08 20:11:02 ??? i put in a rank request for designer V since a build of mine has well beyond the 90 upvote mark, and nobody responded to my ticket, it closed, and i didnt get the rank <:m_:778994206948589638>
help 2021-06-08 20:18:56 it met them all??? and even then just a "nah mate your build sucks lol" would be nice instead of just total silence
help 2021-06-08 20:23:56 wheres the 3rd one?
help 2021-06-08 20:41:45 it looks like theres only two in there, one rope flinger and one piston lagger, the third one just looks like a normal build with a lot of motor locks
help 2021-06-08 20:51:06 It looks like your centre of mass is ever so slightly behind the main rotor, which will make it spin when you apply torque to it.
help 2021-06-08 21:13:57 wait is the lift not centered also?
help 2021-06-08 21:14:26 centre of lift being out of balance *shouldnt* induce rotation, but if the center of mass isnt exactly inline with the rotor it will spin
help 2021-06-08 21:15:10 also make sure the top layer is spinning in the opposite direction and at double speed
help 2021-06-08 21:17:55 but it doesnt spin?
help 2021-06-08 21:18:12 nice
help 2021-06-08 21:18:30 you can add stationary wing panels into the bodywork to help increase stability and reduce the pitching
help 2021-06-08 21:19:12 other than that you'll just have to correct it yourself through control inputs, there's probably a smarter way to do it, but im not the best with helis so i dont know
help 2021-06-08 21:20:41 yeah helis make me want to die
help 2021-06-10 02:53:12 has anybody found out a way to make pushrod suspension that isnt absolute dogwater
help 2021-06-10 02:53:25 i just made a pushrod chassis in the simplest, most compact way i can think of
help 2021-06-10 02:53:29 and its still absolutely massive
help 2021-06-10 02:53:48 
help 2021-06-10 04:57:54 yeah its soft as hell lol
help 2021-06-17 03:41:38 my ship's listing for really bad despite the fact that its weighted equally on both sides, has pontoons on the edges to stabilize it, and ballasts in the bottom centre to help. anybody know why its doing this?
help 2021-06-17 03:47:59 hello 1M3G4_lilbrother <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
help 2021-06-17 04:36:40 thats just how it be some times
help 2021-06-17 05:29:07 the bottom of the boat is literally made entirely out of max density ballast beams <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
help 2021-06-17 05:41:06 i added ballasts to the side that was being raised and after messing around for like 15 minutes like an absolute idiot i got it fixed
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:03:07 ill record doing that yeah but i'll need to edit it down
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:17:05 xd

not really, if it was realistic there would've been literally nothing left and a massive cloud that reached like 200 feet high because the detonation on the mont-blanc was (at the time) literally the largest man made explosion ever

but thank you
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 06:23:33 did rick actually add the ropestorm fix yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 06:23:37 or is it still in dev purgatory
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 06:23:48 because my builds' ropes keep launching me into the 4th dimension
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:45:43 <@!625224427369660416>  you should've used motorlocks to get clean diagonal lines on the wing things instead of having the blocky "step" lines that you have
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:48:54 no i mean using two layers of wedges that lock into eachother to get a clean line here, there should be no reason for it to glitch out
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:51:30 weird
creations-chat 2021-06-18 01:56:11 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:29:27 does the game have bloom now
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:29:38 it looks awful
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:32:06 its a visual effect
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:32:13 makes bright stuff brighter and slightly blurred around the edges
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:32:38 it can look really nice but roblox's built in bloom camera effects are configured horribly and look awful
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:32:53 it just makes bright stuff way too bright and now all my white builds are all fuzzy around the edges
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:33:09 i dont mind it tbh so long as its optional
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:33:12 but having it forced on sucks
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:34:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:34:16 i kind of like no grid atleast since now the builds look nicer when complete
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:34:20 ew
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:34:20 but bloom just looks.
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:43:34 this is a worrying sight
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 23:43:48 just a massive ominous rhombus in the sky over the island
help 2021-06-23 02:42:40 messing around with drivetrains, except my wheels are spinning in opposite directions, how would i make it so the wheels spin in the same direction?
help 2021-06-23 02:50:47 <#519624169730605086>
help 2021-06-23 02:50:58 look in pinned
help 2021-06-23 02:51:53 i know that thats how gears work but since bevel gears dont exist in this how could i reverse the rotation in a way that wouldnt be larger than the entire fucking universe since rickje refuses to give us the most basic of mechanical devices <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
help 2021-06-23 02:52:21 just click on the # it'll take you to it
help 2021-06-23 02:52:55 its in the "other" category
help 2021-06-23 02:53:08 yeah thats through the usage of bevel gears which we cant make unless we want them to be gigantic
help 2021-06-23 02:53:37 fuckin idk then
help 2021-06-24 02:49:39 this game makes me want to die
help 2021-06-24 02:49:57 i added extra water propellors to my evergiven so it wont be horrendously slow
help 2021-06-24 02:50:05 but they were weighing it down too much and it was sinking
help 2021-06-24 02:50:07 so then i removed then
help 2021-06-24 02:50:09 and changed NOTHING else
help 2021-06-24 02:50:13 just undid the extra engines
help 2021-06-24 02:50:17 but it still sinks for no fucking reason
help 2021-06-24 02:50:31 i had a perfectly functional boat before and now it just sinks because it hates me i guess
help 2021-06-24 02:50:42 IT EVEN CAPSIZES NOW TOO IVE LITERALLY NEVER HAD IT DO THAT BEFORE
help 2021-06-24 02:50:56 I am going to obliterate whoever coded the water physics at roblox

help 2021-06-24 02:51:20 not only is helium for noobs who dont know how pontoons work
help 2021-06-24 02:51:23 but i fucking tried that
help 2021-06-24 02:51:30 (it didnt fucking work)
help 2021-06-24 02:51:44 the boat is literally identical to how it was when i loaded it in for the first time today
help 2021-06-24 02:51:48 but now it doesnt work anymore
help 2021-06-24 02:51:58 theyre like helium but not dogshit
help 2021-06-24 02:55:05 these are the exact same fucking boat with 0 changes made, but the first image was taken a couple months ago and it worked flawlessley

help 2021-06-24 02:55:09 PAIN
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:11:05 agree, looks good but get more angles of it
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:13:07 i give literally 0 shits if people try and copy and its got a lot going on inside the body so even if they copied it wouldn't work right 
and thank you

like half of the build is held together through text blocks that you cant even see so good luck copying something you cant see <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:20:42 i thought it had a cowboy hat for a second but no thats just the island
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:27:12 no idea whats going wrong here exactly but you might wanna move to <#478584971670454284> just so you dont need to deal with 2 minute slow mode
creations-chat 2021-07-10 02:11:33 thank
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 22:54:20 250 blocks of my 1000 block car are cameras... hell <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-07-13 06:17:44 i tried before and it didnt go well xd i got the proportions so fucked up

also like a million ppl have done the camper but i havent seen a single aztek until now
creations-chat 2021-07-13 08:42:02 unpro because you didnt use motor lock to get diagonal lines so the paint region on the edge of the wing looks like shit <:trollface:775024642104229898>

colours are nice though
creations-chat 2021-07-13 23:55:38 i am very late, and this is true but that being said if your build is already good without locks then purposefully not using them to get cleaner lines and more accuracy is just kind of stupid <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 04:09:27 yeah but its more fun to blacklist them over and over and force them to stay despawned <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-07-24 06:38:11 yeah why the fuck did you use water wheels <:empty:794431705070174238>

they are worse in every conceivable way
creations-chat 2021-07-24 06:40:40 an aquatic truck wouldnt even use the wheels to move it would use an onboard boat engine with floatation devises on the side, and even then using water wheels would make it function incredibly worse on land just for like an extra 5 sps in water

help 2022-01-04 22:37:10 text blocks arent meant to have collisions right?
help 2022-01-04 22:45:18 ok nvm figured out what was going on its working now
help 2022-01-05 22:39:18 anybody here good with mechanical stuff? (like REALLY good), a build of mine stopped working out of nowhere and I cant find out why, and everybody ive asked so far hasnt been able to help either
help 2022-01-05 22:41:10 here's the build, it works fine, except out of nowhere the front and rear differentials make the drivetrain seize (they were working fine yesterday)
help 2022-01-05 22:41:36 it spins for about 2 seconds, and then locks up
help 2022-01-05 22:51:52 also sometimes when it locks up it reverses the rotation direction for a moment
help 2022-01-05 22:51:55 which is really weird
help 2022-01-05 22:52:13 given that physically shouldnt be possible with this design

help 2022-01-05 22:55:30 whats your user
help 2022-01-05 22:56:16 done
help 2022-01-05 22:58:22 kk
help 2022-01-05 23:05:48 oh yeah its doing that on my end too
help 2022-01-05 23:06:01 it was doing that yesterday too tho
help 2022-01-05 23:06:03 and it still worked
help 2022-01-05 23:06:09 go back ingame
help 2022-01-06 01:26:30 where's your center of mass and lift
help 2022-01-06 02:05:22 your center of lift is far forward, which is making the plane pitch up and thus stall
help 2022-01-06 02:05:38 and the elevators are the control panels at the back of a plane which control pitch
creations-chat 2022-01-06 21:05:34 unblacklist him then re-blacklist, it despawns it

also why is this in creations feedback
general 2022-01-06 21:07:50 mm, yes. very good discord, nice counting
general 2022-01-06 21:09:36 this was literally the first build ive made in 4 months
general 2022-01-06 21:09:37 lol
general 2022-01-06 21:09:45 but i was planning on making a more compact version sometime later
general 2022-01-06 21:09:51 and for that id be doing it from scratch
general 2022-01-06 21:10:30 i dont think its really possible to make it frictionless, every motor will have a bit of friction and that's going to add up regardless
general 2022-01-06 21:10:55 currently the biggest source of resistance is the suspensions in the drivetrain which bend and twist a bit
general 2022-01-06 21:11:03 but i've stabilized them as much as I can which reduces that a lot
general 2022-01-06 21:11:33 for size I already have an idea for that, but some of the linkages in the driveshaft are already as small as they can physically go without breaking
general 2022-01-06 21:11:56 for example, these can be made shorter but thats it
general 2022-01-06 21:12:22 with what
general 2022-01-06 21:12:32 i dont see how that'd be any smaller
general 2022-01-06 21:13:05 ok and these are 2x2
general 2022-01-06 21:13:08 so
general 2022-01-06 21:13:38 i do because of the hover engine
general 2022-01-06 21:13:46 i did another car with a longitudinal hover engine and thats very bad
general 2022-01-06 21:13:54 the moment it gets any airtime it starts rotating along the axis of the engine
general 2022-01-06 21:13:55 which is
general 2022-01-06 21:13:56 horrible
general 2022-01-06 21:14:05 transverse does that too but it just plants the wheels on the ground anyways
general 2022-01-06 21:15:43 wdym
general 2022-01-06 21:15:59 cause ive got one thats 20,000 blocks but thats not as dense as they could be
general 2022-01-06 21:16:02 that one is actually mostly air
general 2022-01-06 21:16:27 its cause of how hover engines work (Which I'm using since theyre A) silent B) allow for variable throttle input and C) are simple and fairly compactable while giving good power)
general 2022-01-06 21:17:08 no im just saying thats why im opting for them over other options
general 2022-01-06 21:17:21 its just that for some reason when used like this they create a counter-rotation when airborne
general 2022-01-06 21:17:46 no i dont i never talk in this server and i frankly do not give a shit <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-01-06 21:28:35 why are the reactions on this build so totally fucked? this is what it shows on my phone which doesnt make sense, nor is it the same as on my computer <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2022-01-06 21:46:57 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/928764142951727124 how does this work as an engine
creations-chat 2022-01-06 21:49:28 do you have any idea how much work thatd take to do though for like basically no gain <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:13:31 the wheels diameter is pretty small for that

also tfw single suspension coil per wheel
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:19:40 that one isnt even that compact lol
ive got a 5x2x4 suspension but even still that wouldnt fit
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:41:12 paints kinda wacky, but its really nice looking other than that
general 2022-01-07 01:59:07 hmm
general 2022-01-07 01:59:24 no just sh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:45:36 m. nice,
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:45:39 havent saved in a while
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:46:16 man i remember why i stopped playing this game
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:46:17 xd
help 2022-02-01 05:51:43 Can anybody give me some tips on making sails?
help 2022-02-01 05:52:16 never done them properly before
help 2022-02-01 06:41:54 how big
help 2022-02-01 06:44:20 a hover drive then probably
help 2022-02-01 06:44:35 since you can throttle it up and down
help 2022-02-01 06:44:42 conveyor drive wouldnt be needed for that
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:21:20 working on this is actual fucking torture oh my god
(yes i know the jib sails arent the right shape and i dont fucking care they are horrible to work with im not fixing it fuck off)
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:26:56 they took me a fucking ***MONTH*** TO DO

JUST THE JIB SAILS
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:29:54 6 segmented fold into an angle lock into another fold ontop of another folding build with 1 block gaps between the sections and angles that change each time the build spawns that cant be measured or recreated accurately, and also i have a life outside of this game

also i had to restart like twice to change the position of the mast to get more room, and if i want to fix them to look accurate i have to restart the entire build


wing panels are too thin and the fold dont connect then, but yeah blocks are too thick
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:32:56 go ahead and rebuild an entire 5000 block build you spent a month on because a single thing looks wrong then, asshole
