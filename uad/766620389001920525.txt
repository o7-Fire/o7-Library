bug-reports 2020-10-17 09:04:40 sometimes when you want to go bck to build mode it wont teleport you to your area and sometimes when you spawn at different locations it mkes your controls inverted
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:45:47 i really dont understand the fact that when i actually build a huge build everyone downvotes it and when others build VERY simple builds like a mini car they get lots of upvotes
