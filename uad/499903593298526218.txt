bot-central 2020-12-10 16:48:56 Well are they going to add that?

the-dump 2021-03-15 21:36:12 This is the Rick Astley paradox: Imagine you meet Rick Astley. In his possession is a copy of the DVD of the Disney Pixar movie "UP." Assume you were to ask him for his DVD. Rick Astley claims that he will never give you up, but by not giving you up he's letting you down which he also claims he will never do. Along with this if Rick Astley were to do neither and just walk away instead, this would also be a problembecause he claims that he will never say goodbye and desert you. If none of these options seem viable and Rick Astley instead decides to kill you it wouldn't work because he will never hurt you. he cant lie about owning "UP" because he can not tell a lie. He cant deny the paradox because he knows the rules and so do I.
general 2021-03-15 21:37:42 I put it in dumb and here
