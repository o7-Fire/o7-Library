general 2020-12-27 03:07:16 how is that censored but that isn't
general 2020-12-27 03:07:37 felony
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 03:08:09 I just did the worst best thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 03:08:18 I made a giant drawing canvas

thirsty
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 04:28:25 my mini missle build just freezes in mid air
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 04:28:26 üò¶
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 04:28:29 any help
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 23:52:54 how do I keep my submarine from tilting on the z axis
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 23:53:04 it's my first sub
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 23:53:30 I already have helium at the top so that's one step done
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 23:55:41 it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 23:55:43 thx
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:07:46 how do I make my mech walk in a straight line
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:08:54 well
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:08:57 uh
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:08:59 I can't
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:09:03 but its very basic
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:09:14 basic piston and motor setup
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:10:16 one leg goes up in the air
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:10:25 but for a bit both slide across
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:10:34 wait no
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:10:36 both touch
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:11:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:11:37 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:16:55 I solved it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:17:00 I needed propellers for the feet
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 18:17:55 <@!297019145084469248>
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 02:25:43 my bipedal mech is fine but it slightly shifts from side to side
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 02:25:50 is there a solution
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 02:35:40 i've accepted that mechs aren't viable now
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:42:53 this is probably helicopter basics but
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:43:14 when I try to go foward my heli looks up and wobbles uncontrollably
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:44:23 well
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:44:34 I saw a guy that had a build that put tnts across the whole map
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:44:46 they fell from the sky with parachutes
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:44:55 maybe that
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:45:57 well I saw a guy that had a very fast gyrocopter
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:46:03 it was black and green
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:46:14 which is what i'm trying to DO
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:47:24 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:47:43 do you want something that stands out
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:48:23 detailed builds are like a double edged sword
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:48:43 they're cool but it's like "oh another detailed build"
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:49:12 I prefer efficient builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:49:21 or "performance"
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:49:28 with MINIMAL detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:51:22 i'm going to try to make the world's smallest helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:54:04 I give up
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:54:56 because i'm noob at helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:03:51 carpet bombs have propellers right
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:04:39 I mean, I knew it was a carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:05:36 what if someone made the world's longest object
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:05:44 with motorlocking camera tricks and all
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:06:55 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:07:16 I said lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:07:50 use half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:08:28 also why aren't anchored blocks truly anchored
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:09:28 it works now
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:14:26 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:14:36 i've made a new variant of the trail tornados
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:14:41 it uses pistons
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:14:47 and it's bigger than ever
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 16:15:54 best thing is it's super slim
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:09:32 what is the height limit
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:20:11 nah
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:20:16 it's 40
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:20:20 I did it myself
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:52:20 how do I use a conveyor engine without the boat converting into a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:53:25 fine
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:53:52 thing is
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:53:57 it has to go really fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:54:22 so a hover drive?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:58:04 hover is slow
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 17:58:13 46 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 18:07:34 I got my boat hover drive working
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 18:07:36 now
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 18:07:38 how do I turn
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:06:09 how do I make my heli go foward
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:06:27 what kind
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:06:43 I've tried everything and they make the heli look upward
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:19:56 what does the mc role stand for
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:28:12 a drifting tank
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:28:15 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:28:21 less weight and more performance
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:28:46 a tank with physical treads
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:28:59 wait I get it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:29:51 those tanks with really big treads
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:30:07 I KNOW
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:30:16 there's a tank with big treads
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:30:18 a model
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:30:25 a miniature
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:30:33 not an actual tank tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:31:06 ww1 mk iv
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:31:12 looks funky to me
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:31:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:32:01 ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:32:12 the tank I showed?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 04:32:36 oh yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:07:37 I finally made my heli stable
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:07:42 the saga has ended
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:16:12 don't be sad that the saga is over
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:16:20 now that my heli is stable it's super slow
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:16:26 so the saga continues
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 23:44:36 I open discord and this is the first thing I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 23:44:42 üëç
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 23:44:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 23:47:05 I saw the same thing but it was black
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 23:47:08 black hole
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:44:32 
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:45:11 hmm
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:45:52 see
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:46:54 I made a really disturbing image once from a simple stickman image by adding like 20 filters on paint net
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:47:02 and i'm not sure if I should post it
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:47:12 no
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:47:28 I won't give em the chance
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:49:03 however I will post this
the-dump 2021-07-09 00:49:10 
the-dump 2022-06-11 01:52:09 
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:26:36 can you make an unanchored block start unanchored
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:09 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:18 can you make an ANCHORED block start unanchored
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:19 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:30 dang
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:46 a trapper
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:56 with ropes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:28:50 
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:29:23 i've tried but for some reason it makes it unstable
