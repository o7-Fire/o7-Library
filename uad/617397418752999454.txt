The Tale of mmkyu17 (617397418752999454)
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 18:32:20 I made a X-wing but I can't steer it and everytime I try to accelerate it backflips
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 18:41:17 I think it's because the control surfaces are in a part connected to a motor
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 18:50:52 I put guns in my plane but I can't shoot, do I have to connect them in any way?
