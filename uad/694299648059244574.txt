creations-chat 2021-11-17 21:10:04 You think it‚Äôs funny to screenshot someone‚Äôs NFT?

You think it‚Äôs funny to take screenshots of people‚Äôs NFTs, huh? You must be a very immature person to steal someone‚Äôs property that they PAID for. Yeah, I said it. You‚Äôre the kind of person who thinks that property theft (a seriously illegal offence) is a joke. I don‚Äôt even know why you took that screenshot, because you didn‚Äôt pay 1000 dollars for it. I did. The blockchain doesn‚Äôt lie. Even if you try to save it, it‚Äôs my property. You‚Äôre just angry that you couldn‚Äôt afford this priceless masterpiece. Even if you could, your fingers couldn‚Äôt even click fast enough to get one of the 10000 NFTs sold. You‚Äôre just mad you don‚Äôt own what I own.

So, delete that screenshot, or I swear, you‚Äôll be hearing from my lawyers.

creations-chat 2021-12-31 17:33:53 <@!698587744842022983> here‚Äôs some advice for your f-8, from the builder of an a-7.
Move the wings forward a couple blocks, make the cockpit level with the spine, make the vertical stabilizer wider, hide those hideous rockets, make the nose less pointy (I recommend to use a pontoon) and get rid of the horizontal part on the back of the wing, it needs to sweep continuously
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:46:57 nvm, nose is good, although i'd make hardpoints under the wings for the rockets for another spot you could put 'em, and i think you should shrink the cockpit and make the entire spine angled
