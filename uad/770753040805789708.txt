The Tale of -Data- (770753040805789708)
general 2022-02-20 22:14:37 yall is there any plan for space in pc2?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:15:35 yall is there any plan for space in pc2?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:16:00 cuz with a game you can fly/make rockets, its assumed that there should be space
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:16:54 lotta players leave cuz theres not a key feature
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:18:17 planes got air
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:18:28 tanks got ground
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:18:33 but no space exactly
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:18:48 as far as I know its not that hard to add
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:19:29 well, setting it to night leaves alot to be desired
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:19:41 it just turns pitch black
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:30:30 no, its really not
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:30:53 space has light
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:30:57 and doesnt have gravity
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:31:14 as I said
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:31:20 night mode leaves alot to be desired
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:32:20 bro stop trying
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:32:53 (not true btw)
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:34:59 assuming that there are NO stars, NO sun, and NO earth to reflect and cast light
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:36:06 and the general player does not want to spend 200 robux for a gravity feature that should already exist in space
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:36:26 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:36:57 directly
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:37:02 no matter to diffuse it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:37:19 ?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:37:49 its energy
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:38:12 light is energy
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:38:47 im honestly surprised that people in general dont know how light behaves
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:38:58 or my grandpa taught me well
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:39:18 yep
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:39:46 sounds like
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:39:58 matter that uh... how do I explain
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:40:26 matter that absorbed energy and is slowly letting it go in the form of light energy
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:41:48 so the big answer is yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:41:52 there is light in space
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:41:59 (as long as there stars, sun etc)
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:43:02 ye
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:44:23 that we can disagree on, sorry
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:45:16 I wish there was something you could do with that glitch
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:45:21 too bad
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:45:53 how?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:46:11 dude
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:46:17 only a few block types
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:46:32 and theres not much you can do with it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:48:01 I wish there was some way to buy bigger boundaries
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:48:16 whether in private servers or not
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:48:36 cuz some people
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:48:44 like (and can) build bigger
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:49:10 it would be glitchy
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:49:12 sadly
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:49:26 buildings?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:49:44 oh
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:50:13 oh well, thats different
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:50:44 that wouldnt, ... no...
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:50:51 I see so many problems
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:50:56 ye
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:51:53 what would be plausible
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:51:57 import and export
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:52:09 then you can do whatever you want with things
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:52:33 thats... not the same
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:54:09 only certain people make tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:54:23 import-export would be very easy
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:54:29 but anyways
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:55:15 cuz its a sign of unoriginality
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:55:27 and people sometimes say they built something when it was a tut
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:55:33 ye
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:57:11 thats tiny
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:49 I wish tank fish made tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:58 their builds are stunning
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:29 I only watched the pc ones
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:47 ya know what someone should make
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:51 a new Stratos
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:19 not an OG stratos, cuz thats not possible
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:53 the og stratos interior is 90% cabin
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:20 got a pic?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:28 oof
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:53 ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:02:31 tnt
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:03:07 um
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:03:18 I meant TNT armor
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:05:31 make space, rick
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:32:59 is the neon material going to be in pc2?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:33:51 do you know why?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:34:10 then thats not an answer
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:35:22 shithead? how was your day?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:36:39 and no answer can be taken without reasoning
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:36:41 gooday
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:37:13 well the problem is
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:37:20 adding lots of lights gets laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:37:25 and lights are limited
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:37:41 ?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:38:03 confused
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:38:35 neon is a texture though
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:38:39 it doesnt get laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:38:48 well
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:38:54 as laggy as lights i should say
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:39:09 wdym?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:39:14 textures get laggy?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:39:35 its not as laggy as lights
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:39:49 and what about a strip?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:39:52 well no
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:40:01 neon is not as laggy as lights
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:40:22 do you build in studio?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:40:26 hm?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:40:48 thats to laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:40:57 its still too laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:41:02 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 03:41:15 im duped by the stupidity
help 2022-03-09 03:42:00 will the neon material be in pc2?
help 2022-03-09 03:44:49 which is laggy
help 2022-03-09 03:44:51 and limited
help 2022-03-09 03:45:07 no it wouldnt god
help 2022-03-09 03:45:54 you would rather it be laggy so much that you cant play?
help 2022-03-09 03:46:08 or that lights are so limited that you cant add enough?
help 2022-03-09 03:46:11 no
help 2022-03-09 03:46:15 there should be neon
help 2022-03-09 03:46:24 i dont see why there isnt already
help 2022-03-09 03:46:55 actually no
help 2022-03-09 03:47:01 it makes a bloom effect
help 2022-03-09 03:47:04 not light

help 2022-03-09 03:56:59 excuse me?
help 2022-03-09 03:57:35 yes light makes it laggy, not bloom
help 2022-03-09 03:58:07 you were saying?

help 2022-03-09 04:03:36 sorry
help 2022-03-11 02:55:35 is there a way to make rounded corner blocks?
help 2022-03-11 02:57:57 what are those?
help 2022-03-11 02:58:21 teach me
help 2022-03-11 02:59:13 ok then
help 2022-03-11 03:01:00 well searching on youtube, there is nothing related to overlocking
help 2022-03-11 03:01:48 oh
help 2022-03-11 03:02:25 so-, to make the rounded corner, would it require angle-locking?
help 2022-03-11 03:02:32 cuz if so, thats all i need to know
help 2022-03-11 03:02:52 oh ok
help 2022-03-11 03:03:15 depends on the build
help 2022-03-11 03:03:25 balls?
help 2022-03-11 03:03:35 have you tried that?
help 2022-03-11 03:03:39 cuz they dont weld
help 2022-03-11 03:04:05 oh
help 2022-03-18 17:44:23 i accidently oversaved 4 seperate builds packed into 1 save file that i had been working on for 2 weeks.
did the 'undo' button work? no
did anyone think to fix this problem? apparently not
will i work for 2 more weeks rebuilding the damage? no
help 2022-03-18 22:06:13 that wasn't the point of the report
help 2022-03-18 22:11:09 good point
help 2022-05-03 04:06:33 with motor 2s when mouse pointing, don't the tops always point toward mouse?
help 2022-05-03 04:07:14 well
help 2022-05-03 04:07:18 I just did a test
help 2022-05-03 04:08:10 I see
help 2022-05-03 04:08:16 so just weight?
help 2022-05-03 04:09:11 alr, ive been under the impression that the tops *always* are chosen for mouse pointing, thanks for enlightening me
general 2022-05-20 02:41:22 excuse me what?
