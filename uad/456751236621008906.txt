plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:44:13 does anyone have the problem with turning enemies invisible when you shoot them with bullets
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:44:26 because i do
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:45:19 i think i know why it happens
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:45:59 do you see when you shoot on your screen you have red bullets but everyone else doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:46:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:46:35 but i think those red bullets also do damage
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:46:46 but only on your side
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:23 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:27 that is what i am saying
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:48 i think that is the thing that needs to be fixed
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:38 yeah but all they need to do is remove the clientside bullets to fix it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:49:08 or make the clientside bullets not do damage
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:50:14 he should remove the clientside bullets and the issue will be gone
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:50:21 it cant be that hard to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:51:04 well if he doesnt try the issue wont fix itself
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:51:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:51:59 not to be rude but he is lazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:52:28 what do you mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:52:50 are you insulting him
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:54:26 maybe he doesnt like people being rude
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:55:29 why are you speaking backward
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:56:17 you
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:57:00 maybe he is in a mirror
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:57:20 thats what someone in a mirror would say
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:57:45 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:59:48 a question science cant answer
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:01 i like helicopters and drones in this game much more then planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:08 because you cant hit planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:22 why do people use plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:40 planes cant be hit by anything
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:55 they just zoom in kill you and then fly away
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:03:57 i hate it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:04:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:05:21 i do
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 09:06:10 its fun when you find a server that isnt filled with shredders and super vehicles that cant be touched
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:28:20 i made a drone that can aim behind itself with a gyro
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:29:20 it flies
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:29:40 it cant fly too well but it can still go fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:49:09 why
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:49:41 im not good at making a round ball
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:54:38 and if i covered it in block it would be too heavy
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 08:57:51 i made new one
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 08:58:12 it is round
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:01:53 why wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:02:02 how do i be right
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:04:25 oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:04:57 the gyro wont turn all the way around if i dont extend the gun forwards
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:05:04 thank you for telling me
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:15:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:15:21 it is very usefull
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 09:15:41 it lets you aim in every angle
general 2021-01-09 14:00:57 not that my opinion matters but i think cars are possibly some of the most boring vehicles ever

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 20:39:24 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 20:39:46 no
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:33:09 an entire team of unoriginal sweat jets <:agony:687065195708809309>
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:36:56 yes
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:39:07 i think the point of a building game is to be creative so yes
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:42:03 you didnt design the actual real life plane did you?
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:44:37 thats like recoloring a cartoon character and calling it your own design
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:48:54 yes it uses a gryo to aim behind itself (my own idea)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:52:18 its not a shredder and its a very old build (i have a new i one)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:54:54 no because that would defeat the point of being able to move the gun in directions other than where you are moving
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:04:31 what it does is it allows for me to be able to point the gun in every direction regardless of the builds orientation (it doesnt fly very smoothly but that wasnt the point)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:09:13 how is it a shredder ball??? also it isnt that slow the gun is still difficult to take out and you saying that any of your jets could slap me sort of proves that you are sweaty
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:11:49 are gyros illegal or something???
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:16:04 fighter jets are like the most common thing and the gyro gun thing is an idea that i had
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:21:56 there is no problem with them being common it just means they arent what i would call original

it is a gyro gun because it is literally a gyro what do you mean

and ive also seen other people with jets before
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:29:33 all i said is that you are unoriginal and try too hard (you make the best thing you possibly can to win in pvp)

also i havent been playing for an entire year i dont play every hour of every day (unlike you <:tro:885324460750676049> )

and i can you stop calling me shitty person because of my opinion on the thingy you made on a video game
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:32:37 thats cool that he likes it i just think it sucks balls
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:35:02 i dont need to be a master chef to call food bad
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:38:24 builds that i havent seen before a billion times also you guys are very vulgar
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:41:17 i never said that the build was of low quality i was calling it unoriginal and tryhardy
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:46:29 id say something unoriginal would be a jet which has been done loads of times

something that is tryhardy would be a super fast unhittable jet that isnt fun to fight

the ball gun is only for combat i know but its not my only build and i wouldnt have brought it up if it wasnt for him mentioning it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:15:10 not to me. trying to hit something that is untouchable is not fun to me, im not mad because theyre better than me im mad because i hate having to switch servers because of jets like that always ruining it. how is motor 2 bad? i dont like fixed weapons whats wrong with that? and im not describing an entire type of build im describing the kind of jets that just fly by and rocket you and you cant do anything about it except hope that a rocket somehow hits it even though its going so fast.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:17:47 this is exactly what im trying to say
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:20:10 i dont want to have to conform to a meta
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:27:59 i do chase, but i cant chase something that is so fast that roblox physics start breaking and what good would a red glowy light do?
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:34:55 my computer can handle high speeds. the problem is that i start going through others build and the rocket explosions dont work right, also why do you hate motor 2 so much seriously what is the problem with it?????
