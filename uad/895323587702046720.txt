general 2023-02-10 08:20:41 Oh that?
general 2023-02-10 08:20:45 That's infinity
general 2023-02-10 08:21:04 It's exponential
general 2023-02-10 08:21:20 Astrophysics mane

general 2023-02-10 08:23:11 That's cubed
general 2023-02-10 08:23:17 Squared is ²
general 2023-02-10 08:23:21 Cubed is ³
general 2023-02-10 08:23:28 Three dimensional
general 2023-02-10 08:23:33 Against rwodimensional
general 2023-02-10 08:23:44 Nah it's just my hoppy
general 2023-02-10 08:23:50 It's meant to explain bent space
general 2023-02-10 08:24:03 You see,
general 2023-02-10 08:24:20 You have to travel more distance if you go on a flat plane
general 2023-02-10 08:24:41 The one on the right
general 2023-02-10 08:24:51 Quadrant one has an exponential graph
general 2023-02-10 08:25:07 Yupp
general 2023-02-10 08:25:22 That's an exponential graph
general 2023-02-10 08:25:27 The curve is just wrong
general 2023-02-10 08:25:35 The text has limits
general 2023-02-10 08:25:45 The fucking dot isn't even aligned
general 2023-02-10 08:26:45 
general 2023-02-10 08:26:54 The thing on the middle is a black hole
general 2023-02-10 08:27:21 The distance between the two wine glass lookin things should be infinite
general 2023-02-10 08:27:33 You can't possibly reach the singularity
general 2023-02-10 08:27:43 There's an infinite distance between it and you
general 2023-02-10 08:28:04 You enter a blakc hole
general 2023-02-10 08:28:11 And exit a white hole..
general 2023-02-10 08:28:17 They are opposites
general 2023-02-10 08:28:33 If a black hole sucks you like a gawk gawk 3000
general 2023-02-10 08:29:07 The white hole would fucking vomit you out on the speed of light
general 2023-02-10 08:29:22 It's an exponential graph believe me
general 2023-02-10 08:29:41 There's just two of them
general 2023-02-10 08:29:55 The other is for the black hole
general 2023-02-10 08:30:01 The other is for the white hole
general 2023-02-10 08:30:16 Those graphs defien the distance between you and the singularity
general 2023-02-10 08:31:18 YES
general 2023-02-10 08:31:34 Thank you
general 2023-02-10 08:32:16 Still studying it

general 2023-02-10 08:37:00 I asked my teacher about it
general 2023-02-10 08:37:17 We did cartesian planes
general 2023-02-10 08:37:27 The past year or so
general 2023-02-10 08:37:46 I asked him to show me what other graphs would look like
general 2023-02-10 08:40:08 I only tried to visualize what
general 2023-02-10 08:40:16 ² could look like
general 2023-02-10 08:40:23 If you repeated it
general 2023-02-10 08:40:35 It's value would increase expo
general 2023-02-10 08:41:02 Q4 is an opposite of the other
general 2023-02-10 08:41:14 The value decreases expo
general 2023-02-10 08:41:38 Augh
general 2023-02-10 08:41:50 I'm still learning it mane
general 2023-02-10 08:42:21 It's what i understood

general 2023-02-10 08:51:03 With the opposite of it on the other side
general 2023-02-10 08:51:45 Yes
general 2023-02-10 08:52:03 I'm trying to fit in on the same paper
