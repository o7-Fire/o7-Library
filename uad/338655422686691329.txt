help 2019-07-06 19:43:24 So, i'm making a rocket, and as far as i'm aware the center of gravity is in the middle, but when i try to fly it it automatically starts to bend backwards and then it's pointing towards the ground. Can anyone help?
help 2019-07-06 19:44:00 the rocket
help 2019-07-06 19:44:18 
help 2019-07-06 19:48:03 Thanks man.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:16:43 Lmao. This guy just came up to me and said 'copy guy'. I'm not sure if he mean's I'm copying him, because he's making a rocket too, or if I'm copying it of yt, in which case that is also not true

plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:40:01 If it matters to anybody, use 0.9 blocks with the rails to make your train as stable as possible.

plane-crazy 2019-07-09 20:02:23 i wish there was a really long train track that doesn't have intersections because i wanna see how fast my train can go before derailing and i wanna see if i can walk around in it and other stuff but the damn rail is so small and i can't do much because i have to constantly click buttons to move the intersections
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:15:24 wish there was wedge friction blocks for slightly better wheels
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:47 wait, does it actually give friction?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:49 damn
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:09 so does metal material make blocks stronger or somethin
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:57 and glass

creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:50:47 A working, loading explosive ball gun with 6 rounds. Featuring a piston and trapdoor mechanic for a locking and loading system.
creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:52:45 This is the reloading mechanism. It opens the trapdoors and uses a piston, one linked to a different key on each end to push each different row of bombs into the 'loading bay'. Then, those two pistons push the ball down into the barrel via the ramp, where a magnet fires the ball. You can also load two balls at once, but it uses up two rounds.
creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:53:15 
creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:53:33 
creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:56:10 Truth be told, you can load as many rounds as you want.
creations-chat 2019-07-24 15:00:14 Well, yes
creations-chat 2019-07-24 15:00:59 since you can make the clip longer to have more rounds, as seen here:
creations-chat 2019-07-24 15:01:31 Though it isn't advised to load more than 3 rounds, because they tend to get sent flying up the ramp and out to the side.
creations-chat 2019-07-24 15:02:36 Though tbh i don't know what direction the balls actually go in. The magnet shoots them so fast that they look like they've disappeared
creations-chat 2019-07-24 15:04:15 I put a target in front of the gun and it turns out that if you load one round, it's extremely fast and accurate, and any more and it turns into a shotgun.
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 15:48:49 I can agree, as I and in the server too. He says tank fish copied him.
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 15:51:10 It's funny.

creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:22:15 with 2 missiles
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:22:35 i'm dm a picture
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:29:56 Frick nvm i deleted it a while back
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:29:58 welp
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:30:03 i'll try and make one
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:34:35 I'm unsure whether you mean a missile propelled by a mag, or rocket, so I'll go out on a limb and assume you mean a rocket.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:35:58 In fact, I'll do both.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:41:44 I figured just using *one* piston to load the rockets into the barrel would be a bit lousy, so I used a design which,
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:41:45 well
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:41:47 you'll see
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:53:01 Alright. I've got the basic desgin
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:53:37 It's relatively crude, and is a bit finecky, and far from compact
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:53:38 but
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:53:42 it works
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:58:04 The issue is that, being a 1x1 missile (3 tnt blocks, a pyramid nosecone and a super rocket on the back) The barrel supports a 1x1 interior thingy, meaning it gets more or less jammed in the barrel due to the barrel itself being to tight on the missile. But de-restricting the barrel, and replacing the blocks with half blocks giving it 0.5 of a block extra space on each direction means it fires, albeit WAY less accurate and for some reason makes the missile prone to glitching. So it's a double edged blade, but you asked and this is the best I can come up with in the shortest amount of time.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:58:33 I'll give it more than one round, then make it glass so you can see the interior
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:00:17 Also, the damned machine creates a helluva lot of lag.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:06:30 Here it is. Far from compact, but it gets the job done. One thing I have noticed is that from what i assume to be the expansive amount of pistons, the machine slowly jitters to the side. The gun was originally pointed right at the target.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:07:30 It has 2 shots, but you can add more to it with (relative) ease. The only thing is that it seems the more rounds you add, the more unstable the gun gets.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:08:08 Process of loading a shot.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:08:51 Shot is loaded. Unsure why the pistons are desynced.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:09:37 It's prone to getting jammed, in which case press the key to reverse the mag. (I have it set to 2. 1 fires the rocket.)
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:12:23 I can't picture anymore as my game is slowly getting laggier, both due to the extensive amount of glitches in the gun and the people trying to bash into the blacklist barrier because they kept ramming the gun. I can assure you that, although relatively hard to use, it works (sometimes.) Recommend good pc and internet and you shouldn't have too many lag-related issues involving the gun. It's less accurate than I hoped, but it works. I'm really surprised I made this at 2 o clock in the morning in relative speed.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:13:36 The gun also has a habit of jittering around and randomly jumping into the air while loading / firing the second round. This often causes the gun to break, either glitching the round behind one of the pistons or just throwing it out of the gun altogether.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:14:15 If you want, <@!451025784228806656> , (Tomorrow) We could get into a game so I can show you it in first person. Though it's your choice.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:20:47 OOH. This is good news. I extended the barrel on the gun, which made it a lot more accurate. Also, It appears to have eliminated some issues, and I managed to get through both rounds with NO issues at all. Might be luck, might be smarts.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:22:20 I would add another round and experiment with it if I didn't already know it would probably break my pc
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:28:47 <@!451025784228806656> Nice. Have a good time. Like I said, I made the barrel longer. And, I just found a pesky stray half block which I believe was the cause of all the jams, because I've removed it and since then I've had several test runs and none of them have jammed.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:32:04 Just made a 3rd round. All went well, aside from the lag that it caused.
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:47:15 Not sure where to post this. Username is XLVenomSmoker. Thinks its so cool and funny making a penis shaped rocket.

plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:51:15 I used my rocket car to ram him onto his side and off the map and he started raging.

plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:02:00 cancelled = no longer working on it
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:02:01 i suppose
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 16:07:28 i wish there was some kind of block that doesn't stick to other blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 16:07:38 so it would make motor doors and piston doors easier

plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:13:10 Hey, I asked before if there was a game like this but based in space. Someone answered, not sure who, with a game, but I can't remember the name. Can you remind me of the name? You said it was free, and I'm interested in getting it.
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:15:19 Ah. I thought it ended with craft.

plane-crazy 2019-08-26 21:25:59 i really wish rick would add something, idk what it would be called, but you could place it on any side of a block or wedge and then blocks that are placed on it won't then stick to it, E.G: like minecraft, so it would be possible to make sliding pistons that don't look ugly, for instance so my truck can have rockets that slide out of the sides without it being too obvious and ugly
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 21:48:05 Is there any efficient and relatively easy-to-control methods of making a hover truck?

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:23:02 Alright. Because I joined a server with 2 people trying to lag other people.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:23:06 I wouldn't ever do it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:25:23 Yeah. It's getting annoying. I don't know too much about the subject but one mentioned magnet throwing or something like that and a person, supposedly the victim, is complaining about the lag, but at the same time cheering them on. But, don't get me wrong, they aren't doing it to the one person.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:50:03 Wait, are motors only able to move a certain amount of blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:52:39 Because I'm making a massive turret. When it's all unconnected and the motor has no weight, it works. But as soon as I connect it, the turret doesn't work.

plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:14:24 or at least i find it does
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:14:34 that and if the turret weighs too much for the motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:15:13 Try aiming around without activating the camera
