creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:41:44 https://streamable.com/pcn2aj i improved my Desert eagles accuracy to the real gun and increased it firing range plus it can fire single shots now
creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:46:37 if you call it a B-52 its a bad B-52 but if you say its a custom Bomber then its really good
creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:56:30 no i did not copy your barrel, though they look freakishly similar in some ways
creations-chat 2020-12-03 21:59:42 this is the one of the images i used
creations-chat 2020-12-03 22:03:24 the Deagle is still a work in progress i need to add a few more details

creations-chat 2020-12-04 23:54:41 https://streamable.com/ispjj9 my attempt at an MiL Mi-26, does anybody have advice to make a single rotor heli fly?
creations-chat 2020-12-05 00:01:21 gee thanks...
creations-chat 2020-12-05 00:18:01 does anybody know a good way to counter the torque of the rotor spinning in one direction that does not depend on a double rotor design?
creations-chat 2020-12-09 23:19:24 hmmm you might be right, it could just be the camera angle though I adjusted the dimensions for robloxian scale so I could fit in in my plot
creations-chat 2020-12-09 23:33:41 ah, yes a person of culture

bug-reports 2021-03-18 01:35:34 chat refuses to load, this has happened dozens of times to me before and it only seems to be fixed when several people leave the server, does anybody know a solution?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:32:27 because yes- its not permanent either, just some trails I can remove if I feel like it, I also could not care less about how other people think about it, I did it for me alone
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:40:06 if people don't like it that is fine by me, but I am not removing it
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:44:49 yes it does have variable geometry wings
