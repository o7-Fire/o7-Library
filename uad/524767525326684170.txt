creations-chat 2022-03-10 17:26:43 “research” purposes <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-03-10 22:20:05 <@!696816232325709824> eh, build looks pretty mid ngl, still good tho, I think the barrel gets too thin for an AA gun, assuming you were going for a 20mm
creations-chat 2022-03-10 22:22:30 I feel like it would be better if you just replaced it with more pvp guns, would give the effect a 20mm has on a plane

Also the base could be improved

creations-chat 2022-03-13 10:04:35 Here’s my M113 with a BGM-71 TOW, use it as reference if needed (it’s still not complete so)
creations-chat 2022-03-13 22:19:57 anything i should fix here? (its supposed to be a fictional drone based on the MQ-9 Reaper)
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 03:04:25 MQ-X Phantom is complete with guided missiles that are really effective, and a good sight as well
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 03:08:32 ┓ ┏  (ur welcome)

creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:35:50 yeah i was thinking gear was a little long,

<@!595298908574449688>  alright, will do
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:39:17 Mix of a few drones, MQ-9, MQ-1, etc.

Also, I'll probably replace the guided missiles with bombs
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:52:41 <@!612103018246176778> this better? (its a GBU-12 Paveway II)

creations-chat 2022-03-18 19:27:39 i need ideas, what jet should i make from the 50's - 80's
creations-chat 2022-03-18 19:30:11 Oh god, lets hope the Su-22 I make isn't Libyan, because I think some of us know what happened on August 19, 1981, over the Gulf of Sidra.
creations-chat 2022-03-19 23:46:06 Wdym lol, his looks good
creations-chat 2022-03-19 23:49:32 You asked for front and side view lol, he gave you a front and side view, you never specified what type of side view
creations-chat 2022-03-19 23:51:43 Side view can mean anything, say left-side view, up-side view, down-side view, etc. I am very much okay as well. You are the one who needs to cope with the fact nobody is on your side.
creations-chat 2022-03-19 23:54:12 Even worse tail. It’s also abnormally long.
creations-chat 2022-03-22 23:39:26 Ok, build it better then, please, show us how it’s done

“White name” why tf does it matter? It’s just a discord color like chill tf out lmao

creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:10:14 Status? Status matters here?
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:15:49 This is a really good creation my g
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:23:13 Genuine question: are you always this much of a prick over a lego game where you build?

Like let the man be happy, don’t shit on his parade, gawddamn

I see that <@!652341016510201856>
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:25:50 Nah earlier they were shitting on the build, and I basically told em to build it better and show us how it’s done 💀

fr, certified PCC moment
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:28:28 “Yeah guys I’m an expert poopenfartden XXVIII terrain special Ed VVVXXZ aeronautics diarrhea 2000, and my opinion totally matters!!11!1”

nah it’s just funny how there’s people here who think a discord role matters
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:30:41 true

yes
creations-chat 2022-03-23 00:34:11 Not better than me, I just didn’t like how you were shitting on the other dudes creation when he wasn’t even involved, and yes, I wasn’t involved either, but it kinda got under my skin because it’s a prick move

You were trying to prove a point by using someone else’s build who doesn’t even deserve it
