general 2020-12-08 06:43:16 "an" "gud"
You confuse me.
general 2020-12-08 06:43:31 *My brain.*
general 2020-12-08 06:43:41 WHY!?
general 2020-12-08 06:44:19 I have hotwired my brain to not be able to read something that is not proper English, so this is confusing to me.
general 2020-12-08 06:45:19 *Help.*
general 2020-12-08 06:46:31 "Do wire brain" = No clue what this means.
"So can read us?" = "So can you read this?"

general 2020-12-08 06:47:07 What does the first bit mean!?
general 2020-12-08 06:47:18 Lol, okay good.
general 2020-12-08 06:47:47 Are you on mobile?
general 2020-12-08 06:48:45 Despite only making 33% of the American population, African Americans are responsible for 54% of murders.
general 2020-12-08 06:49:57 If all African Americans were removed from the city of Chicago, 90% of violent crimes would cease.
general 2020-12-08 06:51:03 Despite making up 6% of the population, Male African Americans are resposible for ~34% of all Rapes.
general 2020-12-08 06:51:15 Nope, facts.
general 2020-12-08 06:51:46 Just like the fact that Men are genetically stronger than women.
general 2020-12-08 06:51:50 They are facts.
general 2020-12-08 06:51:57 I am not discriminating.

general 2021-06-21 11:25:57 Last time I spoke in here was 2020.
general 2021-06-22 03:40:25 I tried to make a plane.
I succeeded, but... it drifts mid-air..
general 2021-06-22 03:42:14 https://gyazo.com/114393ba86b5bc7f31b8035d5d9a94f3

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:43:08 I tried to make a plane.
I succeeded, but... it drifts mid-air..
https://gyazo.com/114393ba86b5bc7f31b8035d5d9a94f3

Can someone please tell me what I've done wrong?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:43:39 Indeed.
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:44:51 Where do I find that?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:45:51 Oh.
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:49:24 I still drift..
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:49:56 Also, it is now nose heavy??
general 2021-07-02 05:07:08 Math question:
If you have a container that has a volume of 20”.
And you have a cube that has a volume of 10”.
What is a way the cube couldn’t fit in the container?
general 2021-07-02 05:08:49 If the container is 2” by 10”, the 5” sided cube could not fit in such a narrow space.
general 2021-07-02 05:11:18 Those are slopes..
general 2021-07-02 05:11:45 How are they not??
general 2021-07-02 05:12:55 I don’t want to pull out a calculator, but it is like ~7.5.
general 2021-07-02 05:13:14 Wait no, distance?
general 2021-07-02 05:13:38 Distance is 2..
general 2021-07-02 05:14:13 3.1415926535897932384626433
general 2021-07-02 05:14:19 I have that memorized.
