creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:42:57 In what way do I add detail to a sub exterior
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:48:31 Isn't that what a sub is? A tube with fins and rudder and block sticking out. I think I should add forward fins though
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:53:14 I already used a lot of wedges in the form of half down wedges on the flat parts. It's just hard to see it in the photo. I also find rounding stuff in really hard on such a small scale like the tower
