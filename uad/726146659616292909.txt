general 2021-08-31 21:05:07 ey you guys know where i can make a suggestion for pc2
general 2021-08-31 21:05:31 thanks bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:08:21 they should make an option for turning off snap to grid in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:08:37 although i kinda can see some cons
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:10:37 i was gonna say that it kinda ruins the aspect of the game where you have to be creative to fit things in but that too
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:10:54 coder torture=not swag
general 2021-09-11 21:16:23 wait are the gamepasses expected to be moved to the second game

help 2022-12-25 16:51:29 about the one issue that has been going on with signs where when you click it you type on it instead of the menu coming up, has anyone figured out a way around that?  cause im trying to detail my builds and its been extremely difficult to with this problem
general 2023-04-03 21:26:54 yea all my m2m is dead too
general 2023-04-03 21:27:21 too bad too cause i just made like the best jet ive built in my life and all of a sudden roblox decides it shouldnt work
general 2023-04-03 21:27:36 within literally one day of me completing it
general 2023-04-03 21:37:14 haha funny m2m break cause game bad haha
general 2023-04-03 21:38:16 lol
general 2023-04-03 21:38:30 literally every other roblox update breaks something else in plane crazy
general 2023-04-03 21:38:43 i dont think it was a game update
general 2023-04-03 21:39:00 cause last time updated was in 2022 ü§£
general 2023-04-03 21:39:11 ong
general 2023-04-03 21:39:17 this should be a feature in pcs
general 2023-04-03 21:39:19 pc2
general 2023-04-03 21:39:40 in pc2 half the game mechanics should cease function at any time üëç
general 2023-04-03 21:40:22 and motorlock too dont forget when motorlock literally stopped
general 2023-04-03 21:40:44 according to the fact that trapdoor problems were present for multiple months...
general 2023-04-03 21:40:45 idk
general 2023-04-03 21:41:22 plus idk if anythings gonna change cause rickje has been working on pc2 for literally over a year
general 2023-04-03 21:41:36 it was supposed to release multiple times and got delayed
general 2023-04-03 21:41:47 so idk what rickje is doing but its clearly not work on pc2
general 2023-04-03 21:42:22 bro fuck no gta is gonna go outta business before pc2
general 2023-04-03 21:43:15 all motor 2s with wing panels just freak the crap out
general 2023-04-03 21:43:23 but not things like turrets for some reason
general 2023-04-03 21:43:40 yup
general 2023-04-03 21:43:42 me too
general 2023-04-03 21:44:14 air flow from ohio üíÄ
general 2023-04-03 21:45:00 bro i was a glitched mouse user for so long but imma be honest id rather use m2m
general 2023-04-03 21:45:12 glitched mouse is so irritating to tune id rather kms
general 2023-04-03 21:45:47 same
general 2023-04-03 21:45:54 one of the larger reasons why i switched
general 2023-04-03 21:45:59 motor 2 mouse
general 2023-04-03 21:46:33 search that one up no simple way to explain
general 2023-04-03 21:46:48 well yes but i dont have the will to explain it
general 2023-04-03 21:46:55 bruh i have 24 days üíÄ
general 2023-04-03 21:48:06 how long has FP been up for
general 2023-04-03 21:48:34 how long did it take to dev
general 2023-04-03 21:48:53 üíÄ
general 2023-04-03 21:49:24 your telling me rickje spent over a year and still is unable to come out with a game before some rando makes FP and it's 10 times better than pc...
general 2023-04-03 21:49:34 in one month...
general 2023-04-03 21:49:38 bruh
general 2023-04-03 21:50:46 bro better release the new  microsoft flight simulator at this point
general 2023-04-03 21:51:30 yep
general 2023-04-03 21:52:01 if rickje decides to hop off his couch and get somewhere with his life maybe he'll have it fixed in the next five fucking years
general 2023-04-03 21:52:05 but for now we hope
general 2023-04-03 21:54:41 "dw guys pc2 this summer!!" - rickje every summer for the next decade
general 2023-04-03 22:03:40 without your main method of control is crazy
general 2023-04-03 22:04:09 i have only built 2 tanks ever and all they were was just bricks
general 2023-04-03 22:04:15 i have no skill in boats either
general 2023-04-03 22:04:25 i just sweat planes man
bug-reports 2023-04-03 22:06:01 yep me as well
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:37:02 if you rely on fps for stabilization too much then a rando with a giant build will just pop up in your server and ruin it all
help 2023-04-16 16:38:56 depends on whether its a violent shake or a sort of hard wobble
help 2023-04-16 16:39:36 as in it wobbles instead of shivering sorta
help 2023-04-16 16:40:38 if it wobbles instead of shivering put wing panels in the nose corresponding to whatever axis youre shaking in
help 2023-04-16 16:41:31 otherwise put the panels in the back in the same way if its shivering
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:45:32 average supercomputer user
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:49:11 guys its easy to fix wobble you just gotta buy the new intel 5.9millionth gen processor with the NVIDIA RTX 10080 gpu

creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:25:00 idk why but so many people i see overmotorlock their builds to look cool, even if it could be perfectly replicated without
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:27:23 it probably looks pretty decent and then you put it in creations and theres a 100 downvotes cause you missed an angle by 1¬∞üíÄ
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:31:04 according to downvoters if your build doesnt look like something in hall of fame youre trash

creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:26:00 why are people talking about the biologically incorrect fact that there are more than 2 genders? look man ive been in med school for the last six yrs and i think i can say there are only supposed to be 2(in humans)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:35:25 you cannot change gender without becoming infertile through HRT, so since youre infertile i would consider you intersex and therefore whatever gender you were before HRT (although this is strange to describe because infertility is not exactly intersex and things get very complex during hrt)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:39:56 intersex is not xxy like a calico cat, it is either xy or xx like normal but the dna was either damaged or malfunctioned during its combination with the egg or sperms dna (very oversimplified)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:50:28 not all traits are genetic mutations, most come from the combining chromosomes during fertilization
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:55:17 i said most arent not all, and blue eyes are a recessive trait.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 19:00:07 i personally have no clue about why this argument is about a flag i just cant let people be educated about biology incorrectly lol
