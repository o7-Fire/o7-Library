help 2021-08-22 16:34:07 not sure
help 2021-08-22 16:34:44 but its worth a try if 5 ballast blocks wont do anything
help 2021-08-22 16:34:52 hm
help 2021-08-22 16:35:27 so do your elevators make you pitch down when you want them to
help 2021-08-22 16:35:37 or is the lift to strong
help 2021-08-22 16:35:46 so your pitching up
help 2021-08-22 16:35:54 but you want to go down
help 2021-08-22 16:36:12 yes but if you want to go down
help 2021-08-22 16:36:23 youd make the elevators go down
help 2021-08-22 16:36:48 so id suggest presetting the elevators with locked motor 1s
help 2021-08-22 16:37:33 
help 2021-08-22 16:38:19 yeh so use 2 motors
help 2021-08-22 16:38:32 one motor would be what you can adjust
help 2021-08-22 16:38:35 which is what you have now
help 2021-08-22 16:38:51 but have another which would pitch them up as a toggle key
help 2021-08-22 16:39:20 this is really hard to explain
help 2021-08-22 16:39:37 well rip
help 2021-08-22 16:44:07 ._.
help 2021-08-22 20:16:20 okay so the toggle option on a magnet allows one to click a button and toggle the magnet to either be on or off. Loose parts only means that the magnet will only attract blocks that are not welded (attached) to it. Magnets only means that the magnet will only repel or attract a magnet not any normal block. Weld means that the magnet will attach and weld blocks to it, they will remain stuck to the magnet and wont be able to move. Super strength makes the magnet very stronc
help 2021-08-22 21:59:34 nope
help 2021-08-22 22:08:50 you can see that the wheel is hitting the rocket have you tried removing the rocket?
help 2021-08-22 22:10:56 hm maybe the springs prevent your motors from fully locking
