creations-chat 2021-08-10 17:55:32 thx. it took a really long time and my thrid build im actually proud of
the-dump 2021-08-12 14:16:37 
the-dump 2021-08-12 14:16:44 never disappoints
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:49:24 is this too tall
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:51:42 reference image
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:53:44 i dont know how i would make it shorter tho cuz if make them 1x2 then it would tilt back too much, could use half 1x2 but would look weird i think. ill probably just finish it and when im done with everything ill see how it looks
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:54:06 anyone got any tiny torpedo designs ive been trying to make small torpedoes for a bit and couldnt get any to work. all the ones that worked were like 8 blocks long and my destroyer isnt fit for that
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:56:08 ik its not done i build it with fabric so i can see when im building as i prefer to paint it at the end. after i get some torpedoes i will make it normal
help 2021-10-03 17:59:11 anyone got any tiny torpedo designs
help 2021-10-03 18:01:13 like 3 long
help 2021-10-03 18:01:31 probably not possible but idk im not great at making working stuff
help 2021-10-03 18:02:03 im tryna fit some on my destroyer heres ss for size reference (not done)
help 2021-10-03 18:02:59 i was planning on making torpedo tube launcher thingies but the torpedoes would never fit and took up all of the ship width
help 2021-10-03 18:03:46 theyre not torpedoes theyre depth charges
help 2021-10-03 18:04:11 i could make them look better but i dont have a lot of space to work with so this just does
help 2021-10-03 18:05:29 oh i meant like explosive ones honestly idc about look i just want working ones
help 2021-10-03 18:05:56 ill try for some again
help 2021-10-03 18:09:14 i tried copying that and didnt really work are there any ballast blocks bc if that can go straight it would be perfect
help 2021-10-03 18:10:23 aight
help 2021-10-03 18:12:19 i was thinking that but i tried a guided torpedo even tutorial ones and just didnt work i didnt try as many tho. if the small torpedoes dont work out ill do that
help 2021-10-03 18:12:41 tbh i cant say im not a good builder
help 2021-10-03 18:12:53 nope
help 2021-10-03 18:14:03 ill test a few more small torpedoes and then i could work on that
help 2021-10-03 18:14:28 ok
help 2021-10-03 18:21:40 trails?
help 2021-10-03 18:41:28 wings
help 2021-10-03 18:41:36 probably not enough wings
help 2021-10-03 18:42:32 try making it ice it will be lighter so the wings will have a greater effect
help 2021-10-03 18:43:04 im not great at making things work btw
help 2021-10-03 18:43:36 yeah cuz its lighter, try using helium instead (applied at centre)
help 2021-10-03 18:46:14 like straight up?
help 2021-10-03 18:46:28 take some away and make sure material back on default
help 2021-10-03 18:48:24 which way do you get flung
help 2021-10-03 18:48:50 probably still way too many helium blocks then, how may did you add
help 2021-10-03 18:49:04 tf
help 2021-10-03 18:49:08 is it ice
help 2021-10-03 18:49:16 bruh
help 2021-10-03 18:49:29 add like 2 sideways hoverthrusters with max drag
help 2021-10-03 18:49:35 if that doesnt work then reduce helium until it doesnt go up so fast
help 2021-10-03 18:50:39 remove all but 1 helium block
help 2021-10-03 18:50:43 idk how 5 is too many
help 2021-10-03 18:52:16 conclusion: your plane is allergic to helium
help 2021-10-03 18:52:31 games physics are weird idk anymore i gtg anyway
