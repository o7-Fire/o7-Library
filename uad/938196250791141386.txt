creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:44:47 mans talking about realism in a game where conveyer (and other glitch) engines exist.
cant forget the questionable physics
Oh also and motorlock
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:47:53 the unrealism (motorlock) is the very reason why realistic looking builds exist
irony

creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:14:43 if people recognise the time and effort the creator put into this, and its sheer size and amazing look, than yes. it should.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:17:15 screw logic.
plane crazy is about embracing creativity
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:21:19 everything gets downvotes, doesnt matter how amazing it is
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:24:49 FR
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:26:52 nobody said they had to be good, they just have to realize the effort the creator put in the build
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:28:56 i dont like how you judge the opinions of people based on their rank and chat color.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:31:08 you dont have to trust them, you just cant come crying about how whitenames judge builds because you dont know most of the people who upvote
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:34:02 <@853042393309904897> ur judging the build based on the  fact that whitenames like it.
judge it yourself and take the actual time to asses it before you come saying whitenames = noskill =  bad opinion
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:36:50 just because it has flaws, doesnt mean you only focus on them.
try focusing on the good things instead of the bad.
also <@853042393309904897> im not trying to shoot back at you, im trying to make valid points, but you dont listen to me because in your mind, whitenames have 0 iq and have no idea about anything and can never learn
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:39:08 im not saying to only focus on the good things, im that you are pointing out the bad things when you could be pointing out the good things. no build is perfect. you're saying that all whitenames do is focus one one thing and think its amazing and upvote simply because of that
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:42:22 i dont think i saw the feedback, but im trying to say that your judging on every whitename ever to upvote on it is wrong. regardless of how good they are or not, you dont get to judge their opinions.
ah yes, the exposed motorlock comeback
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:45:32 <@853042393309904897> i dont want to argue about this until the sun comes down and back up again, can you just try to see my point and i see your point and just stop?

creations-chat 2022-06-16 02:02:26 tell me if im wrong <@432344306427101184> 
you think that the movie is making people overbuild them and that makes them bad?
My reply to that is, even if they overbuild it, they still have to make it, and that takes tiime and effort
BUT, if its no effort and just f14 they made awhile back or rushed, i dont count that, and then ur statement is true
Also, please dont ignore me just because im whitename, i believe my opinion is valid

creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:10:20 bad
fix cockpit
fix afterburners
whats that bump thingy on the back behind the cockpit??
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:12:25 intake is meh, maybe just make it one big afterburner so the plane isnt a lost cause
also, dont make the canopy ony visible from frost, make the sides glass as well
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:14:48 intake already looks bulky
the actual part that intakes the air is WAY too small for an actual plane, either make the part where the air gactually GOES bigger, or make the walls of the intake thinner
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:18:27 i colored ofer the parts that need to be actual intakes part
u can use motorlock wing panels or disconnectors like <@683015364975657024> days to do it
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:21:59 <@370976077805387786> i would say the two biggest problems are the afterburners/cockpit
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:24:18 <@370976077805387786> 
i painted black where glass should be
dleete the bump behind the cockpit that i circled
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:28:11 i cnt see much from that angle but yea its better than the last cockpit
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:30:38 honestly i think you should just redo the whole plane
creations-chat 2022-06-20 14:32:41 i gave him results if you scroll up

plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:00:20 you mean a shredder?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:00:57 i guess, but you would have to have them blacklisted or it would just bounce off the enemy, maybe cutting one block
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:03:20 it would be more efficient to blacklist them, shoot the msisile right through the armour without any damage to the missile and cut a large hole
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:03:52 ig
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:04:16 wait do yoou mean like a shredderbug?

plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:22:40 i dont get why they are called SAMS it should be STAMS

plane-crazy 2022-07-17 15:36:00 Ww1 fighter would probably have way weaker turrets.
Also, a 4th gen could just swoop down and get their slow plane with the gun before the dogfight begins
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:37:28 U could post them separately 
And you could name them like build 1 and build 2
Not build 1 and build 1.1
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:39:44 <@707777796843372554> you could also just post the most improved and leave the other one most improved = better
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:43:47 when did you get the impression you were doing anything wrong?
ur talking to a whitename i pretty much think ur pro builder
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:47:00 i stayed up until 2:00 (est) last night just browsing yt
but ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 15:53:56 just slap a prpeller on an f-22 and you got the perfect dogfighter!
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 15:58:59 maybe a russian plane might have a chance
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 15:59:10 some have great maneuverability and thrust vectoing
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:00:15 modern planes would 100% win iff played to their advantage
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:00:40 they shouldnt be dogfighting a ww2 plane in the first place
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:01:39 less guns
more stealth shit
maybe faster idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:04:17 what if people modernised the paris gun, making it WAY  more accurate and better, make a giant boat, slapped some 5 more paris guns on the boat, and used that for long range artillery?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:06:13 a giant square boat with a bunch of super long range rainguns
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:06:19 artillery 100
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:08:20 magnets would levitate the ammo a TINY bit off the actual barrel and make it super high speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:08:40 give the government moneya nd they can do anything, this is hypothetical'
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:12:01 hmm how about this
one super long range raingun, able to fold up and be easily transported across the world, able to be modified for long range strikes, anti tank/ship maybe even anti air
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:16:04 idk lol
long range maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:17:30 big planes i mean,
you thought i meant fighter jets? lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:18:00 you mean ace combat style?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:19:19 it only needs to be fired once
so mayb a built in battery or somthin
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:20:37 i got the anti air idea from stonehenge in ace combat
it can be used for long range strikes or taking down big aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:25:35 topic change
give an airliner rocket engines
what happens?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:26:48 big plane that carries people from place to place
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:28:00 maybe u could have high powered rockets as a backup incase engines go bye bye
give it a lil speed boost
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:28:51 no i mean
engines go bye bye
mount some rocket boosters at the back
lil speed boost for a few seconds
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:29:35 yea, in the wings
like all airliners
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:30:00 not if the rockets are advanced enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:30:12 it could make it glide for longer until they get the engines back on
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:30:47 if you give the government enough money they could easily make it work
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 16:32:10 mayb

general 2022-07-20 17:20:35 ok
general 2022-07-20 17:21:00 theres no such thing as a corrrect opinion
general 2022-07-20 17:22:09 good or bad is something humans made up so opinions on cant be correct or incorrect
general 2022-07-20 17:22:21 the definitions change a lot
general 2022-07-20 17:22:54 im not saying i like the clothing im just saying the title doesnt matter
general 2022-07-20 17:22:57 and thats my opinion
general 2022-07-20 17:25:59 actually, opinions like "the eiffel tower is in paris" can be called a fact, but opinions like "Good" or "bad" definitions change a lot so they cant really be correct unless you specify the definition
general 2022-07-20 17:26:13 yeah yeah i know
