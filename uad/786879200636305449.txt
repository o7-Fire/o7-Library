The Tale of goatedhuman (786879200636305449)
help 2023-06-16 10:16:44 i got a jet with a hover drive that flies stable at top speed (1.1k knots) but is front heavy at lower speeds (500-600). I've played around with ballasts and helium but nothing seems to make it perfectly stable throughout. Could it be an issue in it's unorthodox design or am I doing something wrong here?
