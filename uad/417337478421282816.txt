creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:14:53 Yes, you could try making the gront overall smoother so it looks more realistic, but for that you would need to know how to motor lock, personally, the front is what ruined the entire ship

creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:20:13 Exacly, i dont critizise EVERYONE i just think it could use a little more work thats all, i dont hate it and i think you did a great job with everything, but i think the front could use more work thats all
creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:23:08 So now im being attacked because i think it needs more work? Smh thats why people post in creations, to find out how the people like it and if it needs improovements and now im being attacked for saying it needs improving? Smh

help 2021-05-07 15:09:55 First, you look at all the technical blocks in plane crazy
help 2021-05-07 15:10:10 Then realise its impossible and think of something else
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:12:36 Its not a disparity, its just how the pcc works
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:18:52 Yeah, the fact if its gonna be taken down or stay up all depends on the community
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:24:26 Yup, ofcourse its incredibly stupid but its just how it is, you cant change it.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 19:50:46 Yes, except that white thing on the side, remove that

creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:13:39 That couldn't possibly be more true.
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:17:15 Your suppost to share them with others and show others how good they are, with only purely pvp deticated builds your entire build bar is just full of garbage then
creations-chat 2021-10-22 07:40:54 Nice progress
creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:09:32 <@836398246506135553> nice pollar express my guy <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:20:01 Straight up polar express. The sheer similarities are uncanny
creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:22:33 I agree! Or at least make an amrored train or some post apocalyptic one. Those are cool.

general 2021-11-23 10:37:50 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:36:43 The front was very good but the back needs a lot of work. The cilinders dont even connect and the engines look undersized and just straight up bad. Give it a paintjob with a bit more colours and fix the back. Then its a perfect build 👍
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:38:46 Yea its good but just add a red strype or something to make it more interesting.
general 2021-12-06 15:56:25 it is decently stable

creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:38:13 ok so:
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:40:45 you have to fix the fuselage (it looks fat and disproportionate, the propeler (the original had 3 blades not 4), the landing gear isnt a block its suppost to fold, the wire connecting the cockpit with the back, the cheese grader wings, and lastly the entire cockpit is unrealistically sized
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:44:45 woa thats actually really good. 



mine better still B))))))
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:46:48 playing plane crazy for 36 hours straight makes your entire body do *strange* things, its unatural....
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:49:20 you are bringing your creation for a vote to decide if it is good or not. if you want to have fun you dont post your creations in there unless you truly believe that its worth it and that the plane/tank/whatever is up to pcc standarts.
