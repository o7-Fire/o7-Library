creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:18:47 I wanted to make the wings thicker, but i have no room for the motor lock
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:21:06 Ok, thanks in advance
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:30:04 I made the props a bit longer, and yeah that looks wayy better
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:32:08 I dont really know what you mean by "fixing the nose". Can you elaborate?
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:37:59 no, its not for stability. the nose looks fine to me tbh
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:45:44 The landing gear seems to be the correct size for me. If i made it any smaller it would be too small.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:49:34 Yup, and the proportions are horrible
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:53:18 yeah florida is weird for having green fire trucks
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:55:58 Yeah, and I saw one in person on a trip to miami
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:01:48 they are in palm beach gardens, which is near miami
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:04:54 I consider roscale to be 10 blocks = 7 meters, so a roscale balloon would be 42 blocks wide
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:09:03 A stud is more close to .28m, and a plane crazy block is 2.5 studs. do the math and you get 1 block = .7m, or 10 blocks = 7m
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:12:09 They arent 2x2x2 or 4x4x4. I recreated a pc block in studio and they are, in fact, 2.5x2.5x2.5
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:16:46 .75 is a bit of overestimate. its just .7
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:19:27 I'm wondering how you got that number

<@718416920474288149> oh
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:21:58 1 stud = 1 foot is a good estimate, but not precise
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:27:31 im also using a post on the dev forum to get my conversion rates
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:38:05 And i just realized my stabilizer's angle is off
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:41:30 yeah i may have put it a little to foward...
creations-chat 2023-02-07 01:56:47 ok now that's much better
creations-chat 2023-02-07 09:12:32 Overlay in an image editor (I use paint.net)
