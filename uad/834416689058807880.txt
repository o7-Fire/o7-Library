creations-chat 2023-05-07 14:24:14 hi guys feedback on this tank (i can feel many criticism from missing details)
creations-chat 2023-05-07 14:27:08 you'll have to use a shit ton of motorlocks for details to get good feedbacks
creations-chat 2023-05-07 14:29:16 the hull is fully custom, its not based on anything and designed to withstand against rockets. turret is inspired from marder but i made it bigger to fit some tnts to make it durable and to make it have good gun depression
creations-chat 2023-05-08 06:23:28 <@554026870912581643> you should remake the hull
creations-chat 2023-05-14 10:37:00 <@915471910991720499> why the actual fuck you made the hull so long
