The Tale of 3baums (767394966540386335)
general 2022-04-25 18:36:45 I have a stupid Idea but I need 6 more people that are good with robots
general 2022-04-25 18:37:11 wat
general 2022-04-25 18:38:29 My Idea is to build a big robot and each player is building a part of the body
general 2022-04-25 18:38:51 and one a strong helicopter to put it together
general 2022-04-25 18:39:03 More like Chipsy Danger
general 2022-04-25 18:39:18 From Pacific Rim
general 2022-04-25 18:41:53 My idea is that one player is building an arm one the other one
general 2022-04-25 18:42:09 One a leg and the other one a leg
general 2022-04-25 18:42:17 You understand what I mean
general 2022-04-25 18:43:03 Cause it wouldn't be big enough
general 2022-04-25 18:43:45 I planed that even the Torse was build by a player
general 2022-04-25 18:43:56 For each part of the Body we need a Plot
general 2022-04-25 18:44:31 Think about the arm would take take the whole plot
general 2022-04-25 18:44:43 That's how Big I want the Robot
