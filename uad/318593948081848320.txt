general 2019-12-21 03:27:57 I just found something pretty pathetic
general 2019-12-21 03:28:12 I blacklisted someone cause they were copying my build block by block
general 2019-12-21 03:28:27 and they built the words "F U"
general 2019-12-21 03:28:30 
general 2019-12-21 03:29:30 they were trying to copy this
general 2019-12-21 03:29:32 
general 2019-12-21 03:33:53 and for being a pretty big plane it is surprising agile
general 2019-12-21 03:45:17 he said this before he left lmao
general 2019-12-21 03:45:19 
general 2019-12-21 03:57:56 this is like my first time actually saying something
general 2019-12-21 03:58:02 in this server
general 2019-12-21 03:58:03 so e h

plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:54:27 I made a jetpack thing that I called "stingray" and before any build claiming issues happen here is an image of my completed jetpack with someone else I allowed to copy it as long as they gave me credit in some way
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:54:36 
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:25:12 I compressed my hoverbike as small as I could without making it super ugly
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:25:16 
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:25:51 it actually works insanely well for the size
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:26:10 more of what the goose didnt say but ye
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:27:16 the only time I ever got it to flip is when another player hit it with their build
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:35:34 do you upload an image
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:36:01 I also compressed it to only 3 blocks
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:36:33 not sure why it uploaded mine
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:36:36 anyways
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:36:48 this is the compressed version of the hoverbike thing
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:37:47 somehow works better than the literally 2 blocks bigger version
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:38:59 oh
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:39:09 just the propeller pushing it forward
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:39:10 and leaning
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:43:05 ye
creations-chat 2020-04-10 06:43:17 the propeller is directly behind the seat
creations-chat 2020-04-10 21:59:11 I have made it even smaller
creations-chat 2020-04-10 21:59:15 
creations-chat 2020-04-10 22:01:17 this is somehow more stable than the previous 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:21:28 do you people
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:21:42 also have the issues
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:21:47 of being harassed by people
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:21:51 in a server
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:21:59 just because they want to copy what you built
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:22:42 2 people are harassing me ingame trying to copy my hover chair thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:23:15 I am just asking not related to what you are doing
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:24:20 probably
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:24:24 I am recording them rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:24:44 is it against the rules to harass and then try to copy you?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:27:22 I think I might be entitled to counter harassment by impeding them in attempting to copy
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:33:00 their usernames are "agentfartz101" and "dss3_fan" and I will send clips of the moments I got from their harassment and attempts at directly copying
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:34:19 here is one of them trying to copy it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:34:44 and this is the other one
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:34:46 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:22 I told them multiple times
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:24 but yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:37 when I was using the hover chair thing they literally
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:41 just followed me
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:50 and even resorted to trying to get me stuck
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:35:56 to try and get a picture of it or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:37:56 and instead of saying "The Germans didn't win the war by copying."
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:38:12 I just called him "a pathetic excuse for a plane crazy player"
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:38:38 cause he is clearly a young child that will most likely not understand the german insult
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:40:31 I am actually going to stay in the server just incase they attempt to try and build it again
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:40:41 and probably insult them again
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:42:04 and also the fact it is flawed because I want to actually use it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:42:15 not just sit in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:43:34 actually I have an idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:43:45 I am going to build a fake version of the chair that wont work at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:49:59 a lil bit of one
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:50:10 <@!300103214873968650>
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:55:18 Ima be that 1 guy and say
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:55:35 a block in plane crazy is technically a 2 by 2 block
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:56:16 so only a quarter of the block is 1 block
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 04:56:37 I c
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:10:03 here is weeb airlines
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:10:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:16:33 I think I might be addicted to tiny builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:16:42 cause my car is super tiny
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:16:45 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:17:53 I can show you a build that is super painful to look at
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:17:58 that I saw
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:18:02 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:18:12 not one part
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:18:14 of this build
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:18:19 matches the other
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:18:56 it was supposed to be like some hover vehicle or vtol
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:19:03 and like
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:19:40 uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:20:17 this is why I abuse the heck out of half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:25:19 you cant have
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:25:22 both parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:25:24 of the motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:25:29 connected to the same piece
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:26:13 I feel like one of us should make a diagram of how parts work
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:26:24 one being the motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:26:56 like how it works
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:27:30 ***ahem***
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:27:34 kph
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:27:59 isnt speed sps?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:28:57 I think there should be a setting
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:29:19 where you could pick if you want the traditional speed or mph or kph
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:32:49 I just got the best timing ever
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:32 I hit someone in the back of the head with my chair thing and they entered flight mode so it look like they were vaporized
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:47 h m
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:50 idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:33:55 for a new server type
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:34:02 exploration
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:35:24 I feel bad for the cocky players who think their walmart budget pc is good enough for constantly having their graphics set to max and then get hit with this new map
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:33 scuse me while I
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:35 just
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:39 steal that small island
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:36:41 on the new map
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:38:16 I honestly just want a slightly bigger build area
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:00 I got it the first time
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:04 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:08 I have already prepared for that
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:19 the entire island will be converted to a super anti air cannon
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:39:47 the thing I would like the most tho is a simple resize tool
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:01 well no
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:02 /but
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:15 well crap
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:24 like
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:28 it would cut back
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:31 on how many different
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:40:34 block types there are
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:41:16 also why do we not have
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:41:26 vertical triangle wedges or corner wedges yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:41:35 I just want to complete corners like this
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:41:37 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:42:34 one last thing I want
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:42:40 is a thrust and weight counter
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:42:45 not just centre of lift and mass
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:43:24 but I did
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:43:31 bs physics so much that I made this
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:43:33 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:44:40 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:44:46 also this plane is not what it seems
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:44:48 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:45:14 "baby"
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:45:29 I literally
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:45:45 can have a house
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:45:48 in this plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:46:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:46:34 7x scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:47:25 if rockets and engines in general
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:47:28 actually exploded
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:47:29 already
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:47:33 then this would be set
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:48:33 I already did it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:48:56 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:48:59 but I made a jetpack
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:50:36 also
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:50:37 apparently
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:50:41 a shopping cart
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:50:46 is just from fortnite now
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:51:03 cause a kid on here said my shopping cart full of explosives is from fortnite
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:51:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:52:52 or do what I do
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:52:56 and bs physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:54:01 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 05:54:17 put actual science into plane crazy and I could
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:01:01 I am getting cybertruck vibes from my own car
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:01:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:04:06 so I gave it a license plate that just says "cyber"
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:04:11 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:06:21 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:06:24 h u h
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:09:46 front one
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:09:48 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:09:57 or front 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:09:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:12:15 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:13:19 the second one gives a bit more space to the windshield
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 06:13:21 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:27:40 this man has been fooled
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:27:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:29:03 he actually thought it was real
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:29:53 who could blame him
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:30:00 He looks like this
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:30:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:31:21 i also got a very mixed emotions image
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:31:35 When trying to get an image of his avatar
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:31:44 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:33:21 and then
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:33:27 Look in the background
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:34:27 kirby already has arms
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:38:15 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:38:56 Should have rules against plagarization
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:46:39 ***hmm***
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:49:31 What
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:50:10 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:50:18 Hard crash
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:51:40 Like users will sometimes get a hard crash to where you cant see or connect to a server
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:11:35 <@!238017332872478720> <@!231831036978397185> here is a possible modular thigh you were talking about
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:11:52 I tried atleast
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:12:23 oddly enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:12:30 the entire bonestructure
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:12:40 for the bends
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:12:51 actually look really close to the lamp
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:13:10 ***atleast I tried***
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:13:35 ***I t r i e d***
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:16:03 cause you are dying
general 2020-04-12 02:17:15 <@!238017332872478720> I did the bone structure of the leg and then tried to add the thickness of the thigh and it didnt work to well
general 2020-04-12 02:17:39 mostly cause the motors kept on wanting to implode
general 2020-04-12 02:18:49 ***I tried ok***
general 2020-04-12 02:19:25 I now feel like the cooks / chefs that gordon ramsay worked with
general 2020-04-12 02:23:30 scary
general 2020-04-12 02:24:13 I am actually
general 2020-04-12 02:24:17 terrified
general 2020-04-12 02:24:22 just because of the speed
general 2020-04-12 02:25:02 I think the avatar editor is imploding rn
general 2020-04-12 02:25:36 be pro
general 2020-04-12 02:26:08 ok nvm
general 2020-04-12 02:26:13 this is more terrifying
general 2020-04-12 02:32:32 ah yes
general 2020-04-12 02:39:17 ***not reading it violates the terms and conditions***
general 2020-04-12 02:40:59 or he is being the troll
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:47:17 I just realized
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:47:27 there is something that is badly needed but overlooked'
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:47:35 the weight of hats ingame
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:49:29 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:50:26 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:51:27 my first big plane was a weeb plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:51:56 it was a private charter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:00 and the paint job
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:04 made it look japanese
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:24 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:25 no no no
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:29 I turned it weeb
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:32 after I noticed that
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:48 like initially it was weeaboo airlines
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:52:53 but roblox tagged weeaboo
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:53:12 so now it is Kon'nichiwa airlines
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:54:12 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:54:13 and yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:54:18 the wing is a banana
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:54:44 true
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:55:14 well
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:55:16 first big
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:55:19 not stick plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:56:48 when people make subs
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:56:54 they try to go for the traditional sub
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:56:58 while
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:57:02 I went for a shark
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 02:57:22 
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:00:43 its actually terrifying when you do that blacklisting glitch thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:00:47 not really a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:00:56 but an unintended feature that makes the cutter op
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:03:44 why would you want to stop that
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:03:52 he can easily play futebol now
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:05:44 wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:06:02 has anyone even made a gimbal yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:06:35 I am talking about like a "perfectly" stable gimbal system
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:07:18 like a gimbal stabilization mechanism in a gimbal camera setup
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:07:48 huh
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 03:07:51 neat
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 02:03:24 I am actually curious
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 02:03:32 I know someone remade the egg as a build
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 02:03:35 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 02:03:37 what about the island
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 02:05:13 I like 5 specifically because it is tiny
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:30:14 the sky island is being rebuilt
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:30:16 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:30:19 by me
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:34:18 reminds me of a firework
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:35:10 probably wing parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:35:39 looks like you got drunk and passed out
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:03:18 does my shark submarine count
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:46:27 I finished the sky island recreation
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:46:29 
creations-chat 2020-04-13 05:52:04 sky island recreation
creations-chat 2020-04-13 06:04:32 perfectly hidden'
creations-chat 2020-04-13 06:04:35

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:51:08 dont hit the actual island's propeller with my mini island
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:51:11 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:51:20 it literally covers the entire map
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:05 what are you even using to get you called that
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:19 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:21 wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:31 would my island get considered a lag bomb if I use it in a pvp server?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:50 but it has an epic explosion tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:06:59 and covers the entire map
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:08:51 I feel ya
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:09:00 I lost a lot of my builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:09:11 uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:09:14 would that help?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:09:47 but didnt is overwrite the save?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:10:21 yea uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:10:25 I think it is gone
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:11:19 I did that many times
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:11:22 before the undo feature
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:12:59 back
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:13:03 like
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:13:05 in 2017
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:13:10 all of my save slots reset
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:13:28 so I lost like 10k parts worth of builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:15:09 I lost 10k worth of crap when my saves reset
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:15:56 they really arent
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:18:37 build a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:18:41 put bombs on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:18:47 connected via disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:21:01 I will be glad
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:21:04 when the egg hunt is over
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:21:25 cause I am finding idiots who cant use common sense on a daily basis now
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:21:36 and then complains constantly in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:21:53 I am not talking about you poke
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:22:15 that looks more like a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:23:29 you could have it open a different way
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:23:39 or atleast
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:23:47 use the xbox recorder
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:23:51 one of the 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:23:59 my dude
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:24:02 you got a windows 10?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:24:07 if you do
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:24:13 it has the xbox companion
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 19:33:14 or atleast a resize tool
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:12 I found one of the dumbest and most stubborn people on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:28 I told him how to build a rotor for a helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:31 but like
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:34 he refuses to do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:51 and when i show him an example
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:29:57 he literally says
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:30:07 "also I said build not load"
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:30:17 like what do you want me to do
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:30:24 spend my time building a rotor for you?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:30:30 when I already have one
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:35:14 I spent
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:35:16 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:35:20 telling him how to do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:38:26 no like
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:38:33 I told him what parts to use
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:38:37 and he refused to listen
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:38:45 and then get angry when he doesnt know how to do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:39:09 oh
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:47:48 I made a boat
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:35:53 separate location of control
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:36:37 one example
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:36:44 you make something like an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:36:49 that also has a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:35 that or
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:37 the
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:42 thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:45 is too far below
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:47:59 where is
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:48:01 your thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:48:03 located
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:48:17 probably
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:48:20 if that is your thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:48:55 I cant tell if this has a tail wing or not
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:49:56 that
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:49:59 is your problem
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:50:48 heck even look at the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:02:03 the 2 parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:02:13 rotate
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:02:16 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:02:27 keep the pieces separate on the build
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:02:30 and it should rotate
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:04:29 this doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:04:56 this doesnt work either
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:04:58 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:05:08 but this does
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:05:10 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:05:29 I am giving examples to fehrex
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:07:23 except for people who played just for the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:09:43 it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:09:47 doesnt turn on?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:09:58 it just rotates
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:00 when you press
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:02 the button
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:05 not "turn on"
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:24 and
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:27 are you smart enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:30 to enter flight mode
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:38 and then
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:10:44 have infinite fuel enabled
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 23:14:23 I got a person who said the game is trash just because their plane didnt work in the server Im in
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:42:38 has anyone simulated a swashplate with motor 2 yet?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:43:25 if not
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:43:55 kraftedkiwi2468 and I have invented a super simple but effected simulated swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:43:58 
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:44:33 nah
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:44:50 cause like
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:44:56 the one kiwi and I made
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:45:07 is entirely mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:46:38 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:46:54 sorta
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:51:39 
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:53:16 australian engineering
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:55:37 ***I didnt even know this was a thing***
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:57:51 h m
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:58:45 now uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:58:57 does the render work in flight mode
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:59:46 wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 04:59:47 imagine
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:00:01 playing plane crazy in minecraft in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:03:16 stream
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:03:26 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:03:28 in minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:03:35 and then stream minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:03:38 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:38 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:40 stream
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:41 you
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:43 streaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:44 while
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:04:46 streaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:05:00 so basically you stream you streaming in minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:05:10 then stream the minecraft stream in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:08:18 you could probably make an infinity mirror with that
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:14:11 I would like this technology
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:14:31 so I could make tv's with ads
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:14:34 on a train
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:14:56 you could
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:15:03 do like
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:15:20 a traditionally coloured submarine
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:17:23 why not
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:17:25 just make
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:17:28 a tiny vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:19:27 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:21:31 h m
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:22:09 why did both images
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:22:12 look different
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:22:13 to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:23:00 make it look more water damaged
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:23:42 give it more like
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:23:44 a colour
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:23:47 where it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:23:53 looks like it has been in the water
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:24:44 more of
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:24:48 parts of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:24:52 will look more faded
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:25:02 kinda like what happened to this couch
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:25:07 
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:26:08 its
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:26:11 kinda hard to explain
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:26:40 like how do you explain the completely random texture of water damage to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:27:03 then
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:27:07 that is perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 05:27:16 might be too much of a difference tho
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:43:25 I made a ship thing that I will colour later
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:45:05 nice
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:45:11 looks like a ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:45:20 a nice ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:45:52 I dont mean a boat kind of ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:46:34 "few"
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:54:39 nice
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:54:44 I also coloured the ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 02:54:47 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:04:33 oh I did make the ghost from halo as a small hover vehicle
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:05:04 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:05:31 its entirely hover thruster powered
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:19:35 I added guns to the ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:19:37 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:17:56 I altered the design of the ship slightly and finally made it actually able to land
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:18:00 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:23:19 oh
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:23:49 yes it has yet to be named
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:24:05 and currently I am just messing with the wings to find a nice looking landing angle
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:25:46 I accidentally made it look more bug like
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:25:48 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:26:13 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:28:40 is there anything I should do to the ship besides getting a name for it?
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:29:19 already have trails
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:51:02 I need me some ideas for the name of this ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:52:27 huh
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:52:33 those are a lot of names
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:52:37 lol
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:53:05 I'll just simplify the names you gave and just call it "Luna" probably
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:02:46 not gonna lie the names you gave sound like edgy pony oc's lol
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:03:39 I'm not naming it after the moth
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:05:00 luna colour palette
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:07:19 good job
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:08:38 did you think of it as like a job interview?
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:09:12 I c
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:12:27 I c
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:12:49 which reminded me about the mothership I was gonna make after I finished my Luna ship
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:15:14 he is "photoing" it
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:15:36 he said that
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:16:15 that sentence made my brain hurt
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:23:31 looks nice
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:23:41 and still waiting for the ability to place 2 wedges in the same block
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:24:35 um
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:24:43 we have delta 1x1 through 1x4
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:25:25 I mean just being able to place them so you dont cripple the design of something making the mechanism to do that
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:25:46 oh
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:26:28 I used them like once when making a micro plane
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:27:53 I literally use them a lot of the time for separation wings
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:28:13 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:28:43 
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:29:05 yes
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:29:47 a ship I called Luna
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:30:06 lol
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:30:10 flying burnt potato
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:31:20 someone said it looked like the banshee from halo
creations-chat 2020-05-25 22:35:37 I dont like how trail parts have an insane amount of drag
bug-reports 2020-05-25 23:07:23 You can edit other people's keybindings and settings on parts when they enter flight mode (not sure if it effects them or not)
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:22:11 I mean you could use the thing you created if the dampers isnt enough
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:23:01 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:23:21 how about wheels made out of suspension lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:23:54 what part of this was spamming
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:24:39 when I made suspension wheels it functions like 10x better than any of my other vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:25:17 I want to see someone make the perfect dampening vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:25:59 I mean making the part you exist in on the vehicle gets little to no change
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 23:26:50 wheels made entirely out of suspension is good ngl but it dies very easily
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:43:48 I am in the midst of making a mothership
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:43:50 
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:45:33 h
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:46:54 huh
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:47:04 I mean I did build a giant amazon delivery drone
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:53:12 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:12 I finished the mothership and I decided to name it "celestia"
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:14 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 07:05:38 Ship called "Celestia"
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:06:28 yes cause I totally got outside of the build area
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:06:38 while in build mode

creations-chat 2020-05-27 03:46:47 
creations-chat 2020-05-27 03:46:53 Ill just let this explain itself
creations-chat 2020-05-27 03:53:53 I am actually curious on how many people actually know the name of the vehicle
creations-chat 2020-05-27 04:39:16 um no
creations-chat 2020-05-27 04:39:37 
creations-chat 2020-05-27 04:43:47 its not even a plane
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:33:24 I made a tiny ship thing
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:33:26 
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:36:50 but it isnt red
creations-chat 2020-08-04 21:38:31 I need a name for this
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 15:10:56 I found out something amazingly stupid
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 15:11:38 if you have your gravity set to 0 and ragdoll while walking you just s l i d e
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 15:14:20 oh my god I have mastered the t-pose
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 15:15:32 you must first figure out how is love
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 16:20:22 I am actually curious if its even possible to breach the blacklist barrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 16:20:27 and if it ever happens
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 16:20:45 will you just get respawned again?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 16:23:35 I c
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 16:24:00 so there is literally no security for it
general 2020-08-25 01:26:34 I just found a roblox ad that uses plane crazy to make the ad
general 2020-08-25 01:26:36 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:56:51 I somehow got a dude to exploit to try and harass me for having a "furry mask"
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:56:53 <:medWheeze:783760323520757770>
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:57:49 infinite jump cause they are using noclip to try to bypass blacklist if I blacklisted them
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:58:15 pretty sure they are with this person
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:58:17 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:58:28 who is trying to fling me repeatedly
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:59:08 username is "iyhutfg8ogfu678yte"
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 20:59:30 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:00:50 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:01:03 earrape and harassment similar to the person with the spinning arms thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:01:41 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:02:14 obviously cause it was an alt
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:03:48 mew has a glitch in the build that makes anything it hits instantly hits the void kill range
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:04:02 which is that earrape diamond sword
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:05:31 
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:06:16 I mostly find it hilarious these people are harassing me over an avatar choice
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:06:21 <:medWheeze:783760323520757770>
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:16:57 I mean it is clearly an alt as it was made today

creations-chat 2021-04-03 06:55:33 couldnt be bothered
creations-chat 2021-04-03 19:02:14 what are your people's thoughts on this small map edit
creations-chat 2021-04-03 19:04:17 I just gave a minor edit to the side near the track, extending the big ramp in width and giving a flat area for a track of sorts for more race type cars rather than off road cars
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:50:19 My standard is if it works it good
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:50:57 If it works its good
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:51:35 And I dont mean if it just barely works
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:52:44 Not that it ever was
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:53:50 Among us the game itself was pretty cool n stuff but the memes outright killed it
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:55:12 The standards are incredibly high cause of other amazing looking builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:55:46 "I drank an among us potion (gone wrong)"
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 14:57:00 
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:37:58 Are you trying to play dumb
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:39:59 Copying is stealing
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:42:01 Copying is quite literally the same thing as stealing my guy
Did you honestly think stealing is only when you take the original one?
