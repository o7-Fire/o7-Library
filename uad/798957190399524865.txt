creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:34:10 Eh, to me, the design just looks bland, you should motor lock the gun, add details and such, and maybe make the aiming thingy (i forgot what its called) more accurate. Also, motorlocc it more <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:40:10 Okay i get the gun, but the "aiming thingy" from what i can tell from the picture doesnt look accurate, as in, the accuracy isnt that good, if that makes sense to you

creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:27:11 How are you all doing on this pleasent day, my wonderful best friends! üòä
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:31:21 It is very much clean, my fellow companion!
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:33:44 I am not trolling sir, it is a very well defined extrodinary build so its a massive upvote! Proportions may be off, but its awesome! Love you all! üòò
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:37:20 Its ok!! Let him be, he will fix it for sure! Spread positivity everyone! üòä
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:39:21 Gjsolo please don't talk, have you seen some of your builds, i mean, you may be amazing at pvp but please focus on asthetics too! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:41:22 üíÄ Also im pretty sure i can get expert role from one of my previous builds posted! Please no negativity!!
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:43:23 I give up being nice 

Do roles really matter in this server that much, i could not give a fuck about them, they dont prove if your good at the game or not  üíÄ

Just something i noticed

Nah because i see lots of people with tons of roles, but like, they are ass
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:45:24 I upgraded it and it looks 10x better now

I was too lazy to try and get roles from it

Istg if you take the design, its called the sa2 samson, please, copy that not my build
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:47:34 Please. Dont copy. Its called the sa2 samson, build it on your own pleasssssse, i added my own modifcations
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:50:23 Chill bro, actually atleast give me credit fr

<@287454032250011649> not in this case, i deadass struggled making this one, took me almost 2 months
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:52:56 Lol, i know, im just saying if you want a good build balance performance AND asthetics


I didnt invalidate your fact, its true, shaders make your build look better than normal, its just not... a bad thing
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:55:49 Pretty cool but, it would be better if asthetics played a role too
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:59:29 Also, ive noticed most of your builds dont actually really function like the real thing, (not your joke builds), if your not focusing on asthetics, or mechanics, what are you focusing on?
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:07:02 Bro didnt even answer me üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:13:25 I see what you mean
Its just a block game anyways, so ig its ok
creations-chat 2022-06-04 00:59:06 Hi my amazing companions! How are you all doing on this fine evening/day/night? üòä

<@914605911744593930> Wait how tf did you know where i live
creations-chat 2022-06-04 01:07:52 1. Being elegant for fun doesnt equal young age

2. Why are you assuming that...

Is that a problem now?? Dumbass
creations-chat 2022-06-04 01:19:39 Thats... not what i mean. Read, please. Im saying that using "üòä" in a friendly and nice tone isnt a problem

I edited the message to reply to his
creations-chat 2022-06-04 01:24:28 I LITERALLY just said, that i said "is that a problem" to the message below it. I wasnt talking about the statment above 

The problem is him saying using a blushing emoji in a nice tone is a bad thing
creations-chat 2022-06-04 01:35:45 
creations-chat 2022-06-11 01:10:33 Nope. But damn that looks similar

Where did you find it?
creations-chat 2022-06-11 01:15:59 Who made that?

Because the other day someone said that they would "borrow my design"
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:07:20 Monestoar
