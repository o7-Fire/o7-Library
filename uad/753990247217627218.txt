general 2023-01-02 12:38:07 Who do I talk to if I have an idea for pc2
general 2023-01-02 12:38:46 How do I get a role?
general 2023-01-02 12:39:41 Ok, say there was like a note pad button and when you click on it you could design your own decal, once finished you could click on the aircraft where you wish to place it and BOOM decal.
general 2023-01-02 12:40:25 Yeah but there arenâ€™t many good roblox decal ids
general 2023-01-02 12:40:44 The main reason is I WANT ROUNDELS
general 2023-01-02 12:41:05 no
general 2023-01-02 12:41:22 On my aircraft I want to put stuff like the RAF rounded or the USAF one.
general 2023-01-02 12:42:02 They should also add multiprogrammable motors.
general 2023-01-02 12:42:27 So they can have more than one function.
general 2023-01-02 12:42:41 Like the f22s elevators also control yaw.
general 2023-01-02 12:42:49 Not yaw- roll.
general 2023-01-02 12:43:15 Yeah do you see what I mean
general 2023-01-02 12:43:21 I think it would be a good idea tbh
general 2023-01-02 12:43:42 Yes but I mean think about how it would look uglier and would be easier.
general 2023-01-02 12:43:59 Ik but what if you wanted MORE than just two functions
general 2023-01-02 12:44:33 Also apparently they are gonna add a scaling tool in pc2 so Iâ€™m excited for small motors
general 2023-01-02 12:45:11 Undo tool would be cool
general 2023-01-02 12:45:32 Or just ctrl+z lol
general 2023-01-02 12:47:17 Ctrl+z is in like any program mate
general 2023-01-02 12:47:21 Word
general 2023-01-02 12:47:25 Docs
general 2023-01-02 12:47:27 Google
general 2023-01-02 12:47:30 All dat shit
general 2023-01-02 12:48:29 I wish they made wing panels like 1 pixel thicker, they look so goofy at how thin they are.
general 2023-01-02 12:49:18 Itâ€™s nice, can you upload a pic of the rear, I wanna see the engines.
general 2023-01-02 12:50:56 Can I see if some agrees with me on something.
general 2023-01-02 12:51:01 Say yes if you agree
general 2023-01-02 12:51:11 Wing panels should be at least 1-2 pixels thicker
general 2023-01-02 12:54:05 Idc I just wanna see ðŸ™‚
general 2023-01-02 12:54:12 Itâ€™s fine
