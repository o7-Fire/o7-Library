help 2022-03-17 22:45:54 I prefer bulkier tracks
help 2022-03-17 22:46:02 ive' always had issues with the length of building time
help 2022-03-17 22:46:15 And they are too complex.
help 2022-03-17 22:46:20 for my at least
help 2022-03-17 22:47:05 Yes
help 2022-03-17 22:48:36 Nice
help 2022-03-17 22:51:06 so, add studs every two links
help 2022-03-17 22:51:11 not every single one
help 2022-03-17 22:51:15 then you can build it around wheels
help 2022-03-17 22:51:31 
help 2022-03-17 22:53:30 you can tension with motorlock or pistons
help 2022-03-17 22:53:32 motorlock is more ideal
help 2022-03-17 22:56:01 
help 2022-03-17 22:56:05 then you can do stuff like this
help 2022-03-17 22:58:37 Remove every other stud, so one link is empty between another
help 2022-03-17 23:00:08 That many wont let you fold the tracks around corners in build mode
help 2022-03-17 23:15:05 Yes?

help 2022-03-17 23:45:07 if you have arm on key for a bomb
help 2022-03-17 23:45:27 it determines how fast it has to be going in a collision with a vehicle or the ground to detonate
help 2022-03-17 23:45:43 a low speed means its hyper sensitive but might be triggered by being simply dropped
help 2022-03-17 23:45:49 a higher means you will have to make it hit fast.
