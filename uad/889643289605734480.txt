plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:01:37 anyways
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:01:52 i wonder if they'll add a 'slow start' to the motors in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:29:37 I dont gotta know it because it isnt in the game lol, i dont even build planes, i build cars, and i dont know crap about that either
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:29:54 But thank you for replying rudely and not answering my question
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:30:30 Yes but that takes time, and movement, and i am lazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:31:08 Yeah i just looked it up
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 08:31:17 Practically a flap on the edge of the wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 09:35:12 Just came off as rude, telling someone they need to know everything about something in order to build it in a roblox game, say that you didnt know what a  manifold is, in different words your response would’ve been ‘you dont know what a car part is yet you play a game about cars?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 09:35:30 Just seemed quite rude
general 2022-05-28 05:34:07 GUYS
general 2022-05-28 05:34:10 picture this
general 2022-05-28 05:34:19 a glossy material for plane crazy
general 2022-05-28 05:34:31 imagine it
general 2022-05-28 05:34:35 it would be epic
general 2022-05-28 05:35:12 what does the factory make?
general 2022-05-28 05:35:27 what brand
general 2022-05-28 05:35:40 THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS
general 2022-05-28 05:35:54 no specific brand?
general 2022-05-28 05:36:08 what kind of ammo does the stronghold have
creations-chat 2022-05-28 05:38:39 20% off, probably 100$ still
creations-chat 2022-05-28 05:41:36 how many pieces is the second picture? also 3d printing lego pieces does not go well, they dont fit nor are they as strong
creations-chat 2022-05-28 05:49:05 i got my reply deleted cause it was too long and 'was spam'
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:46:02 opinions on block idea?
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:46:23 reverse half wedge
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:47:01 oh but you cant
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:47:13 you have to use a half wedge 2 and a normal wedge
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:47:25 how so?
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:47:55 i don't get that question
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:48:46 it would be used as a full block version of the half wedge 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:48:53 maybe for the front of cars
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:49:00 perhaps the sides of planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:49:19 it acts like a half wedge (wedge section) that goes both ways
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:49:34 you could use it for interior walls
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:50:53 the space needed to make this block normally is  about a 3x2x2 area
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:50:56 for one block
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:51:09 but if you made it into a block that was in the game
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:51:22 it would only need a 1x1x1 area
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:51:31 basically downsizing the effort needed for it
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:51:57 holy frick they making that?
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:52:03 i havent been up to date on pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:52:10 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:52:37 i still feel like it would be more difficult than having the block in the category
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:53:24 i see all of your points
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:54:57 does the resize tool not just change the blocks size inside a normal block area?
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 01:55:22 as in if you took a block and shrunk it down to 25% size it would still take up a block in the build mode
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 02:00:49 also another suggestion, although it may be hard  to put it in and code it, just like BrickRigs on steam, an ALT mode, if you press ALT you go into a secondary control group, like switching from your normal vehicle to a secondary vehicle
