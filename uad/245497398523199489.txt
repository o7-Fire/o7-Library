The Tale of zassno (245497398523199489)
general 2022-09-29 22:03:15 Hello world!
general 2022-09-29 22:06:37 As I understand it, there are few Russian speakers here?
general 2022-09-29 22:07:02 Cool!
general 2022-09-29 22:07:18 Does it matter?
general 2022-09-29 22:09:26 I can speak English, Russian, also barely Udmurt and Belarus languages
general 2022-09-29 22:10:06 Not really, just living in Udmurt for a while
general 2022-09-29 22:12:17 In the Udmurt language, I only know swear words.. So that if anything happen, I can swear at the locals with their language. Or to understand that I am being scolded if they swear Udmurt language on me!
general 2022-09-29 22:15:14 Well you dont need to be under 13 to be silly and toxic
general 2022-09-29 22:16:12 What is wrong with white nicks?

general 2022-09-29 22:20:13 <@757565064998944819> as i understand, you are Russian speaking. Do you maybe know any Russian speaking Plane Crazy community?

general 2022-09-29 22:20:42 but it became inactive very much

general 2022-10-04 05:36:44 yes, i could find a news about this if you need
general 2022-10-04 05:44:59 hi people
general 2022-10-04 05:45:29 just made a coffee
general 2022-10-04 05:45:56 hi someone else
general 2022-10-04 05:47:17 Yeah, in theory its easier to replace your brains to opposite gender body than changing your own gender
general 2022-10-04 05:49:30 But unfortunately the maximum that was, it was in 2017 that the head was transplanted. *From one corpse to another corpse*. Such an operation has not yet been performed on a living human head
general 2022-10-04 05:50:02 i think there was tests
general 2022-10-04 05:51:38 what pfp?
general 2022-10-04 05:52:16 whats wrong with this?
general 2022-10-04 05:54:04 is he Polish?
general 2022-10-04 05:56:04 Lmao I remembered when zasno once changed pfp to some femboy and once for furry like for a day. He literally exploded few servers those times
general 2022-10-04 05:56:24 I am sure somewhere should be screenshots
general 2022-10-04 05:57:18 He took a selfie of you while you were sleeping... Is he a stalker?
general 2022-10-04 05:57:31 Yes?
general 2022-10-04 05:57:44 Call of Chernobyl

general 2022-10-04 05:58:58 the trap

general 2022-10-04 06:00:38 whats wrong with him?
general 2022-10-04 06:01:12 Yes and? Still after all he was a nice guy
general 2022-10-04 06:02:10 I think zas wanted to reach some higher rank
general 2022-10-04 06:02:20 it called like "No life" or something
general 2022-10-04 06:02:32 if there anyone with "No life" rank?
general 2022-10-04 06:03:27 If i remember correctly what he told me, its Epic gamer + all Master ranks [X]
general 2022-10-04 06:03:51 i have no clue how many master ranks here and how hard to get them
general 2022-10-04 06:04:18 also racing with max speed cap!
general 2022-10-04 06:04:30 I guess so?
general 2022-10-04 06:05:06 Yeah, if this still dont changed, there is max speed cap in GTA 5 because of old-gen consoles
general 2022-10-04 06:10:21 so you
general 2022-10-04 06:10:31 how did you make?
general 2022-10-04 06:11:09 you're too cheap for a lab
general 2022-10-04 06:12:26 Bad word usage
general 2022-10-04 06:12:31 very bad
general 2022-10-04 06:14:08 I hasten to disappoint you, but no one has been grown in a test tube yet. *At least in the last 10 years for sure*. Does it mean that you are less than 13 years old?
general 2022-10-04 06:15:17 It must be hard to see your friends die for a bunch of thousands of years
general 2022-10-04 06:16:36 adam's apple hasn't gone anywhere
general 2022-10-04 06:16:37 !!!
general 2022-10-04 06:16:57 imagine fuse 0.5 sec
general 2022-10-04 06:17:40 is it difficult?
general 2022-10-04 06:18:30 i bet your skill isnt even average...
general 2022-10-04 06:18:53 have a good rest
general 2022-10-04 06:20:13 did you know about secret stash with last tier items inside of a ship on Odessa map?
general 2022-10-04 06:20:22 if its still unremoved
general 2022-10-04 06:20:50 well to get in stash you have to clip thru wall.. (but there is a glitch for this)
general 2022-10-04 06:21:12 I dont remember
general 2022-10-04 06:21:21 just some glitch
general 2022-10-04 06:21:26 maybe its fixed already
general 2022-10-04 06:22:06 NVidia gamma adjustment  <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-10-04 06:23:27 fixing good
general 2022-10-04 06:23:50 yeah 9x23 is good
general 2022-10-04 06:24:33 there is double mg3 in game
general 2022-10-04 06:24:36 and minigun
general 2022-10-04 06:25:58 actually sleeping at 10pm is good
general 2022-10-04 06:26:03 you can wake up like at 5 am
general 2022-10-04 06:26:05 easily
general 2022-10-04 06:26:55 dementia is for very olds only
general 2022-10-04 06:28:35 its decent however .308 isnt the so good ammo for sniping
general 2022-10-04 06:28:54 i'd use .338 lapua or at least 7.62x54r
general 2022-10-04 06:29:18 its accurate, you can get kills if land *headshots*. .308 cant onehit in torso
general 2022-10-04 06:29:58 well it depends. Yes it oneshots, its accurate but you have a lack of ammo since those calibers are rare
general 2022-10-04 06:31:37 Look around more often and don't make any noise. Еhere is a lake in the caves, in which there are a lot of weapons boxes of decent quality
general 2022-10-04 06:32:41 hate person because theyre too good?
general 2022-10-04 06:32:58 bad what?
general 2022-10-04 06:38:20 less damage than 7.62 obviously
general 2022-10-04 07:01:56 ???
general 2022-10-04 07:03:29 common experience
the-dump 2022-10-04 07:04:26 
general 2022-10-04 07:04:45 lol
general 2022-10-04 07:05:15 there is an "obj.279" in some game as guided nuclear missile launcher
general 2022-10-04 18:13:50 Good time of day
general 2022-10-04 21:09:18 <@597678568884928544> hi
general 2022-10-04 21:21:46 sup
general 2022-10-04 21:24:36 release date of what?
general 2022-10-04 21:25:24 i remember someone told me it must be released past winter
general 2022-10-04 21:28:03 Honestly, the Dream yt-ber became just a puppet for the entertainment of the public
general 2022-10-04 21:32:07 I know the game where this feature made
general 2022-10-04 21:32:13 and even more
general 2022-10-05 15:57:33 Hello
general 2022-10-05 15:58:21 better in what way?
general 2022-10-05 15:58:44 I'd bet
general 2022-10-05 15:59:36 You can't make celery dishes the same as carrots. On the contrary, you will spoil everything with this replacement
general 2022-10-05 16:00:30 Don't you have regular water? Are you African?
general 2022-10-05 16:01:03 It can't be worse or better, it's just different
general 2022-10-05 16:03:05 Did you ever taste salmon, celery and carrot salad?
general 2022-10-05 16:03:44 Or truffle pie with candied celery
general 2022-10-05 16:04:03 As i said, its just different food for different dishes
general 2022-10-05 16:04:31 This is the same as comparing chicken with pork
general 2022-10-05 16:04:58 If he cries, it means you don't know how to cook
general 2022-10-05 16:06:53 Learn how to cook, and you can cook delicious with both carrots and celery, or both together
general 2022-10-05 16:07:34 Celery is rarely suitable for sweet dishes
general 2022-10-05 16:07:50 Carrots are sweet on their own
general 2022-10-05 16:10:16 Are you comparing a root vegetable with an herbaceous plant of the Apiaceae family
general 2022-10-05 16:11:15 I might as well compare potatoes and cabbage, saying that potatoes are more versatile and better
general 2022-10-05 16:12:06 Are you saying it can't be compared?
general 2022-10-05 16:12:37 this is actually what i said about celery and carrots. They do different things
general 2022-10-05 16:12:48 absolutely no
general 2022-10-05 16:13:07 You can't roast celery for soup or sauce
general 2022-10-06 20:46:09 Hello pals

general 2022-10-10 14:38:14 There is nothing surprising left for me

general 2022-10-10 15:16:58 I cant believe Spitfires were made in the same country with this shit
general 2022-10-10 15:18:12 how bit it is?

general 2022-10-10 15:55:57 does it matter?

general 2022-10-10 15:57:14 okay
general 2022-10-10 15:59:38 not all
general 2022-10-10 15:59:59 it depends on people how they will build
general 2022-10-10 16:00:05 they can make larger or smaller
general 2022-10-10 16:01:01 why do you even compare roblox measure with real life
general 2022-10-10 16:01:10 sup
general 2022-10-10 16:02:55 1st person said 1 block is 1/8 meter
you said 1 block is 7/10 meter
general 2022-10-10 16:03:01 well
general 2022-10-10 16:03:10 its really nonsense to compare
general 2022-10-10 16:08:36 It definitely shouldn't be so round
general 2022-10-10 16:09:11 see, its not just round and all
general 2022-10-10 16:10:17 yes
general 2022-10-10 16:11:29 remove intakes and its still v-shape

general 2022-11-01 05:25:03 you experienced clinical death?
general 2022-11-01 05:25:22 Lucky you didn't become a vegetable after that
general 2022-11-01 05:27:06 White means unsullied
general 2022-11-01 05:31:31 Sorry little boy, I didn't want to insult you
general 2023-01-05 09:13:21 It is just few notes. By the way, Vasily Kalinnikov's overture "Bylina" also has similarities with the USSR anthem (if you're looking, listen from 6:25), and much more controversial similarities. But again, it's just a few notes and you can't judge definitely
general 2023-01-05 09:17:21 It can be anything from a coincidence to borrowing this fragment. If you judge modern music by the coincidence of a couple of notes as "still stealing", then there is almost no original music in the 21st century.
general 2023-01-05 13:16:00 Yes, but what about the paraboloid?
general 2023-01-05 13:17:04 It is very easy to make a rounding, stack motors in the same place
general 2023-01-05 13:17:52 it will not be raw at least
general 2023-01-05 13:18:41 what is the power of this lol?
general 2023-01-05 13:19:09 is my electric kettle more powerful than your air fryer?
general 2023-01-07 04:12:58 The guns are too loud. I prefer poison. Stealthily, quietly, and irreversibly 👍
general 2023-01-07 04:13:38 For example, cadaverine. A light cadaverine can be made from a cat, but it is impossible to identify it in the victim after death
general 2023-01-08 14:48:17 I guess it's a bad time to be here
general 2023-01-08 14:49:57 I think this role just wasn't needed
general 2023-01-08 14:50:25 Why?
general 2023-01-08 14:50:47 Nobody cares about such role
general 2023-01-08 14:50:58 It's not cool role
general 2023-01-08 14:51:50 For you any role must be cool xd
general 2023-01-08 14:53:19 I've seen that there exist role higher than Epic Gamer
general 2023-01-08 14:54:12 Blacklist Supreme <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-08 14:57:24 More and more I think that you are just unsuccessfully trying to be funny
general 2023-01-14 16:20:35 Soledar be like:
general 2023-01-14 16:25:57 Blue is mid...
general 2023-01-14 16:29:47 Russia is losing lol?
general 2023-01-14 16:30:22 They took Soledar, leaving Ukrainians terrified of Wagner
general 2023-01-14 16:32:48 You meant that rocket on Poland farm?
general 2023-01-14 16:34:26 <@200793484053970944> Firstly, it was a missile of the S-300 anti-aircraft complex. These missiles fly up to 200 km. From the territory of the Russian Federation, these missiles simply cannot reach Poland through Ukraine. Secondly, there were Ukrainian designations on the rocket
general 2023-01-14 16:36:34 Actual poland citizens aren't so friendly to Ukrainians. There are a lot of videos where Poles swear at Ukrainians with the words "why aren't you at war" and etc
general 2023-01-14 16:39:37 If they do not do this, there will be sanctions against Poland
general 2023-01-14 16:40:05 In fact, this is just blackmail of Poland
general 2023-01-14 16:41:40 I believe you realize what economic problems Poland has because of a bunch of unemployed Ukrainians who live on state money, and also sometimes like to engage in vandalism. This is not to mention the fact that Poland has abandoned Russian resources
general 2023-01-14 16:42:18 Is it from Generation Zero game lol?
general 2023-01-14 16:43:41 Mainly soviet if i remember correctly
general 2023-01-14 16:44:08 oh wait, not mainly
general 2023-01-14 16:45:35 Ukrainians managed to lost a fight of Mig-29 against kamikaze drone...
general 2023-01-14 16:46:52 fair enough
general 2023-01-14 16:49:00 It's even harder to get down a supersonic plane with a slow drone. However as i know its a pilot lost control and crashed plane
