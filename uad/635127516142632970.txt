plane-crazy 2021-12-30 12:24:42 The time before the updates, it was peaceful, what you call dog water now was holy water back in those days, everyone supported each other, everyone was a friend, everyone was together. But one day, the god Rick had decided life was boring and the same, so Rick had given us new weapons to play with, new ideas to build, new blocks to play with, and new features everyone loved. But if a place so happy and glorious only existed in dreams, with the new updates, the 7-year-olds attacked Plane Crazy with their shredders, Plane Crazy lived in fear, the shredders took over every PVP server, the people were driven out, the builds were called dog water, the 7-year-olds crowded over good builds just to spam easy, the terror had consumed all servers (except for private servers) the joy and happiness we knew crumbled beneath our feet, but hope was reviving itself in a deep dark ocean millions of miles below the surface, it will come someday, drive the shredders and the 7-year-olds out, and bring peace upon the land of Plane Crazy.
