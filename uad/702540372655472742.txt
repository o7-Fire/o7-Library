bug-reports 2021-05-27 21:13:04 the ballast blocks are a bit buggy when used for a big machine. they make it bounce around and makes it hard to control
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 22:05:09 does anyone else also have issues with the ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 22:05:50 like for me, the ballast blocks make my bot bounce around and it makes it harder to control
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 22:07:39 so if i put the ballast blocks as metal, it make my bot bounce around?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 22:08:01 so why tf does it make it bounce?

bug-reports 2021-09-13 22:54:32 Bug Report: for cutters in pvp. When you break them off, the block they were on will still do damage, even if the cutter is completely gone, the block it was placed on will still do damage
