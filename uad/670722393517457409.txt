plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:37:58

plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:02:20 like this
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:03:10 im not trying to move the wing closer but im trying to make the wing move faster
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:03:41 the motors feel like they are on 1 torque even tho they are on 1000
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:04:34 even if its on 50 speed and 1000 torque it doesnt help
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:04:48 but when i remove one motor it works perfectly
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:06:26 i did
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:06:34 now its like this
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:06:54 but its still really weak
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:07:04 you can literaly drop few blocks on it and it moves
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:07:11 with 50 speed and 1K torque
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:08:37 eh F it ima just make it elevation only and make the roll with props thx for trying tho
