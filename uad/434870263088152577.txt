general 2020-07-09 00:34:59 I'm in Pinewood builders too, BUT BEFORE YOU BAN ME, i'm only in it because...
general 2020-07-09 00:35:34 I'm not a spy, i just like how cool they are,
general 2020-07-09 12:56:54 Beep boop
general 2020-07-09 15:29:30 Where do I enter the suggest command?
general 2020-07-09 15:39:40 ... the command didn’t work. Am I doing something wrong?
general 2020-07-09 15:41:19 Anyway, I own KSP as well
general 2020-07-09 15:41:41 A mod I highly recommend is Airplane Plus.
general 2020-07-09 15:42:34 One of the parts in Airplane Plus is a Concorde cockpit with a working droop snoot
general 2020-07-09 15:43:24 Yeah but would the droop snoot work?
general 2020-07-09 15:43:32 How?
general 2020-07-09 15:44:24 ... I don’t know if KSP has rotators by default
general 2020-07-09 15:45:28 No, I think the rotators are in the Breaking Ground DLC, which I do not own
general 2020-07-09 15:46:08 Anyway imma go play either some KSP or Roblox
general 2020-07-10 15:50:31 I have a leather office chair, but it’s practically falling apart
general 2020-07-10 15:51:19 Yeah but the only thing I hate about office chairs is the fact that they DON’T WORK WELL ON CARPET
