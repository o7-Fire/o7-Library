help 2020-08-12 15:43:02 aight well that semi fixed it but now its hella slow
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:29:43 what are you supposed to use then
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:30:08 they generate constant upwards lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:32:54 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:33:48 bro have you ever heard of a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:34:29 having normal wing panels on motors are the easiest way to replicate swashplates
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:34:34 bro
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:34:39 you make them tilted
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:55 well
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:36:01 they do apparently
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:36:25 a 4 blade rotor manages to lift this easily
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:37:42 **someone used wing panels to replicate actual helicopter mechanics!!!1!!11!!11!!**
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:38:39 using propeller blades for helicopters is literally the most simplistic way to generate lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:40:03 **i can do the exact same thing with mine**
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:40:59 because theres now way to make a full functioning helicopter engine/rotor system in a 5 block space
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:41:33 **comparing a lego creation to an irl helicopter**
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:42:29 **if its that easy try making an entire swashplate mechanism along with a fully functional engine inside of a helicopter that is 4 blocks wide**
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:42:40 put up or shut up
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:44:03 notice how these rotors arent tilted at a 45 degree angle
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 18:49:05 this conveyor tread refuses to be painted

20 studs equals 1 meter
1 mile per hour equals .44 meters per second
930 miles per hour (which was listed as Mach 1.4 on Wikipedia for some reason) equals 416 meters per second
416 times 20 is 8,320

so really I meant Mach 1.2 but my half asleep brain didn't bother to fact check Wikipedia
general 2020-08-20 23:37:35 
general 2020-08-20 23:37:56 apparently it is
general 2020-08-20 23:38:52 why would you bring irl averages into a roblox equation

general 2020-08-20 23:43:14 you reversed my process
general 2020-08-20 23:43:34 and i accidently said Mach 1.4 instead of Mach 1.2
general 2020-08-20 23:44:03 because for some reason wikipedia says 900 something mph is Mach 1.4

creations-chat 2021-03-12 18:43:28 the interior is nice and the plane itself is pretty detailed, its just out of proportion in some places

~~also i would recommend changing the doors so the top portion also opens up like the real one~~
ah mustve been the angles, i would probably change it to be higher up by like 1 or 2 blocks

creations-chat 2021-10-11 22:26:19 <@!721103577380159490>  looks decent but a couple things could be improved on it

1. the colors, they are pretty eye burning and the gradient on the runway looks too harsh
2. the superstructure, its pretty bland and weirdly shaped. also looks like it takes up too much of the runway. the superstructure should be a gradual incline in height and it would look much better further back on the hull
3. the flight deck markings, theyre pretty weird and makes the flight deck look like a road instead of a carrier flight deck
4. the random ramp on the front, assuming from the design of the carrier most WWII era naval aircraft could take off without assistance from a flat carrier deck so i dont see a point in it, also its such a sharp incline that it would destroy the propellers and smash the front landing gear 
5. the arresting cables, not something really big but the cables look way too close together to be effective, and there would usually be only like 4 or 5 cables

help 2021-10-18 21:56:10 "Out at sea NATO carrier aircraft also had their camouflage toned down to allow them to disappear in hazy conditions during low-level missions.

the overall profile of it is disproportional (especially the wings). while it isnt the worst me262, it's not very good either. the engine placement, cockpit placement, and length all are off. the colors also need work, some colors are too dark and/or saturated.

creations-chat 2022-01-11 02:04:16 <@!734470454311649422> While it isn't exactly the worst E-2 I've ever seen, it most definitely needs improvements. The most noticeable feature that needs to be fixed is the nose, the nose on the E-2 does not stick out like yours does (see the 1st picture). I would recommend making the nose shorter by 1 or 2 blocks, an make it less of a point. The fuselage could definitely use some work, as the tail section seems way too long (once again see the 1st picture). The wing is oddly shaped. I can't really recommend anything to solve this problem besides angle locking, but that's too advanced for you (see picture 2) The radar dish also seems a little small, but it is well shaped. I would extend it's diameter about 2 or 3 blocks (the radar dish should reach the front of the wing from its current position). Another smaller issue, although not necessarily and issue more of a preference, is the livery. I don't really know of any E-2's that have a woodland livery, so I would go for a more realistic naval gray/white livery (see picture 1, again.)

So in all, it needs major improvements. Hope this feedback was some kind of help.

so its not an f15b?
also if its a one seater then it should have only one ejector seat warning on the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 22:20:35 i think the canopy shape is the same regardless of how many seats though

technically it would be possible to get a smooth canopy, but its a lot of work and you're better off with the one you have
creations-chat 2022-05-16 21:02:12 do you have anything better to do than go to a plane-specific community then try to insult people for knowing basic geometric shapes

guess not

creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:43:15 <@456226577798135808> its a good start, but it needs *alot* of work to actually look like alexeyev km :

-you completely forgot the floater arms/wings. (see first and second picture)
-the engines. your engines resemble that more of a p6m than an ekranoplan, make them less square. (see first picture again)
-try to motorlock window framing and remove that block in the middle of the windshield
 -rework the entire hull, you were a bit generous with how sloped you made the boat part (see third picture)
-rework the coloring and interior. the alekseyev was not as passenger vehicle as far as im aware, so there wouldnt be any seats. the interior would be much less nicer, with exposed structural pieces and bland soviet furniture. (see fourth and fifth pictures)

creations-chat 2022-08-03 03:19:51 you definitely nailed the basic shape of it, all it really needs is detailing, like ladders, ifesaving equipment, etc.
and also the colors, try to tone down the saturation of the colors and fix the paint in some places especially the smokestack
creations-chat 2022-08-03 04:27:41 eh, i mean it looks like how it should. definitely could use some refining in some places but it looks fine how it is

creations-chat 2022-08-04 00:34:35 (from left to right)
1. random pole and tip jar (not sure what thats supposed to be), didnt see anything that large on any actual pictures
2. hull number is absent
3. (not included in picture), front deck markings are inaccurate
4. front superstructure/bridge
     -your bridge is square and disrupts the shape, actual arleigh burke is triangular and (mostly) smooth
     -superstructure shape ends up cutting a path in half
     -lacks radar domes and other equipment
     -vls isnt seperate from the superstructure
5. rear superstructure
    -seems too short
    -random brown square on one side
    -pathway is interrupted by a random hump in the middle (where the brown square is) on one side
6. rear hull number should be further back
creations-chat 2022-08-04 00:37:44 the entire front superstructure is the completely wrong shape <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:03:17 pretty sure it depends on the variant, some early variants have curvy rotor housings (which is what mine is). i am currently in the process of repainting to the naval grey livery so expect that soon

also it isnt a chinook i dont know why people keep on calling it that <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:06:46 *the chinook was developed from the sea knight, so technically its the other way around.*
