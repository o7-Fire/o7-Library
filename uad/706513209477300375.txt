help 2021-03-07 20:04:11 I would say first work on the gondola /bombs, and then build the zeppelin around it
help 2021-03-07 20:04:24 Then so you can fine tune the weight

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 22:43:37 Just a question, how many blocks is a foot?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 23:32:24 so, i made a cannon that can shoot at 400 MPH in real life, i did all of the math, and it's honestly insane. it's based off of Prototrode's motorlocked cannon design.

creations-chat 2021-06-17 15:37:47 Hey, so I have a custom C-130-ish design that I have, and it keeps nosing down, I know that I have to add weight to the back, but the plane always breaks, as in the plane becomes too unstable in the pitch axis, is there any way to fix this?
creations-chat 2021-06-17 15:40:12 Ik that, however when I try to fix it, it always become unstable in pitch.

creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:48:15 Here‚Äôs the screenshot, is a jet but I forgot who _ACTUALLY_ made it.  The sad thing is is that he didn‚Äôt even get the tut right, he messed up the engines lol
general 2021-08-28 12:50:00 Is there a way to report tut. Builds in <#384025409945337856>?
creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:52:28 How would you report a tut.? Someone in <#497142796961054721> is being a smartass, so idk what to do here.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:55:48 Someone in general is saying to ping mod to report a tut in <#384025409945337856>, is that what I actually do or‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2021-08-28 13:16:41 Srry, I‚Äôm kinda active on here, and I‚Äôve never had to do this before. I just don‚Äôt trust people lol
general 2021-08-28 13:19:36 You‚Äôre good. People have put the 1940‚Äôs German flag on warship, and the ship was meant to be a 1:1 recreation of the real thing. As long as you use it in a historical sense, you should be fine.

general 2021-08-28 13:20:55 They used it as a recreation though
