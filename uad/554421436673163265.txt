help 2022-06-08 21:33:00 wait its motor 2 how can i lock a motor 2
help 2022-06-08 21:35:59 well i did a bit of testing and the motors only are janky when they have all the shotgun pellets (cutters) still loaded
help 2022-06-08 21:36:10 is it cause its too heavy? if so how do i fix
help 2022-06-09 00:19:14 anyone know why my motor 2s are tweaking?
help 2022-06-09 00:19:36 specifically two motor 2s controlling a very heavy gun
help 2022-06-09 01:46:55 how do i set a preset for stuff so i dont have to manuall change the settings for each one? and im not talking about copy paste
help 2022-06-09 02:07:43 yea
help 2022-06-09 15:56:48 how do i make so that a certain item already has preset settings the moment i place it?
help 2022-06-09 17:48:11 what does restitution and speed do for ropes?
general 2022-06-10 02:05:44 why is this community so harsh
general 2022-06-10 02:05:57 genuine question cause half the things in the posts are mass downvoted

help 2022-06-10 04:11:41 how can i fix a limb being too heavy for a motor 2?
help 2022-06-10 04:12:01 wym
help 2022-06-10 04:13:24 like putting weight on the other side of the motor?
help 2022-06-10 04:19:14 vague
help 2022-06-10 04:19:46 could counter the weight with helium or counterweight by putting stuff on the other side
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 04:23:26 why is it that my railgun aimed by motor 2s goes to my mouse perfectly fine but when it has the disconnected explosive inside of it it just sags and my motor 2s do nothing
help 2022-06-10 07:40:56 how do i stop a motorized limb from wobbling?
help 2022-06-10 07:49:41 yeah i gave up on it
help 2022-06-10 07:49:54 it wasnt weight it was the wonky physics of disconnected objects inside the chamber
help 2022-06-10 07:50:52 how can i keep a motor 1 completely stable when turning tho
help 2022-06-13 13:34:17 how do i counterweight
help 2022-06-13 20:48:18 anyone know why this happens and how to fix it? https://gyazo.com/dff38b4d2160b2ce28c9a8d4cdf549b5
help 2022-06-13 22:13:52 so it cant be fixed with our current mechanics? rip
help 2022-06-13 22:15:01 i wonder if we'll be able to bring our pc1 creations to pc2
help 2022-06-13 22:15:05 probably not but just a thought
help 2022-06-13 22:15:46 oh nice
help 2022-06-13 22:15:52 gotta wait for pc2 then
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:55:50 hey how do i make a piston conveyor drive? i put them in a vehicle of mine for a turning system but they dont work at all.
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:56:33 because its the best thing i can think of, rockets arent good for turning and im not using wheels
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:59:22 anyone?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:59:55 i tried, i did exactly as it says and it just doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:00:10 yes i dont think theres anything else powerful enough to turn my 2k block vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:00:23 😩
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:00:51 what you recommend then
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:06 they kinda suck
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:36 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:39 its a thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:43 idk what it is im just making it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:51 this is the movement system
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:01:55 on god
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:02:14 at least this is the movement system that im trying but is not working
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:02:33 facing away from the piston correct
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:03:26 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:03:34 the picture is what my build currently looks like
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:03:52 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:04:04 its supposed to touch something?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:04:27 i see
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:04:51 oh i have to extend the piston?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:05:17 oh ok no R word then
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:05:30 thats what i tried to say
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:05:36 no reason to be toxic tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:06:31 i see, so the piston has to push the conveyor onto the thing it needs to touch?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:07:18 for both sides?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:08:11 i see
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:08:11 oh my goodness gracious
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:08:37 does the piston need keybinds and settings? if so what are they
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:09:37 ik but like what should the distance and MaxForce stats for it be
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:10:31 ok thanks i think thisll be the last question, should the conveyor be on toggle mode or not
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:11:13 ok thanks a bunch
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:13:12 <@693249246157340713> i see what you mean by 6 being too much, in fact i think 1 full power is too much https://gyazo.com/81e93e7847b48c4bd709e1f9627eb444
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:13:23 just a hunch
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 14:57:53 is there anything that fits here?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 14:58:38 rip
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 14:59:20 real
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:29:06 very helpful
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:43:13 theres a lot of wedge types that are missing
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:43:19 hopefully they'll be added in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:45:46 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:54:31 also half triangle wedge 1x2, 1x3, and 1x4
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:54:40 theres a few more but i cant remember them off the top of my head
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:56:23 anyone know why trails arent working tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:57:08 they were working before, now they refuse to work on any of my builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:57:27 idk what the configs need to be ive always had them default and theyve worked
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:57:33 oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:57:35 is it unfixable
general 2022-06-15 01:04:03 that plane is just like me fr
general 2022-06-15 01:04:04 a felon
general 2022-06-16 00:15:49 my lord that guy was so full of himself
