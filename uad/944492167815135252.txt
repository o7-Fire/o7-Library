general 2023-01-26 02:41:15 i make huge ships but i usually dont make them move if theyre over 150 blocks long, so basically i make them purely for looks
general 2023-01-26 02:41:36 usually i add guns and things tho for pvp
general 2023-01-26 02:42:15 im making a p8 poseidon bc the p3k2 just retired and are being replaced by the p8s
general 2023-01-26 02:42:40 me when im bored
general 2023-01-26 02:42:48 usually i use jets tho
general 2023-01-26 02:43:05 bc all the jets kill you as soon as you're spawned in
