The Tale of Jack The Ripper (650205110747529226)
general 2022-03-03 02:49:01 like many people i use tnt to press a button to make my motor locks actually lock, but i find it annoying that because its tnt i can only use my builds in pvp, please in plane crazy 2 add a block that can just dissapear with the touch of a keybind, when it dissapears it will literally physically dissapear, as in, it will not connect to anything after it dissapears, i want this so i can have togglable motor locks, but not be stuck to pvp, please add this 
(Suggested by my friend)
