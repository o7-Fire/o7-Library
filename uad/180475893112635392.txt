plane-crazy 2020-03-13 23:14:32 You could probably program it to print a pixel art
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 05:29:08 did anyone just now get disconnected or like save got to 0
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:33:51 just now, like this guy, I lost my save slot because it's now 0
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:42:37 My original/primary save is literally the autosave and I did not have autosave disabled. I went to a normal save to experiment with something (because the original one takes ages to load).  Why do I use the autosave to save? because I disconnect from ROBLOX games a lot and that save will save if I Dc, the save single-handedly takes up more than half of the alloted amount ROBLOX gives so I can't use **double-save backup strat** anymore, and I'm paranoid I will lose everything which just happened now. So I'm not surprised...

When I was done, I loaded the original save (which was literally the autosave slot) and nothing happened (maybe because the normal save saved to the autosave). The amount of blocks on the original save was still the same amount when I tried to load, in additon. I tried loading it again and again but nothing changed.

 So I impulsively clicked "undo" and it went to the amount of blocks my experiment (normal) save had, so I clicked again and it went to **0**. I clicked undo even more and nothing happened. 
Then, the "Server has disconnected" message with the blur in the back appeared and so I rejoined, but it was all gone.
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:43:42 help I worked 5 months on it
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:44:00 and over 100 in-game hours on literally that one creation
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:45:54 that is the server I was using. why do i use this server? because people (even in other VIP servers) keep ramming my stuff. and it's distracting and I don't to lag people cuz I know lag affects the server
bug-reports 2020-03-23 05:47:28 if I don't get it back it's okay I was sick of working on it
