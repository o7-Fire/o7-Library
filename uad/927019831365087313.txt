help 2022-04-12 16:29:41 making a pvp plane but decided to make a weapons bay, should i keep it?
bot-central 2022-04-12 16:31:30 !rank
help 2022-04-12 16:32:54 i agree, but i have 2 rockets in each weapons bay, one tracking and one untracking, not planning to use bombs since id have to respawn to reload the bombs
help 2022-04-12 16:33:23 may i ask why?
help 2022-04-12 16:33:32 i use them as normal missiles
help 2022-04-12 16:34:13 i dont recall my own rockets hitting my own blocks and exploding, im pretty sure it goes through my blocks
help 2022-04-12 16:34:25 unless i shoot it with my own gun, then it'd be game over
help 2022-04-12 16:35:06 i started playing plane crazy like a month ago
help 2022-04-12 16:35:10 i dont have it yet
help 2022-04-12 16:35:28 ill make sure of that
help 2022-04-12 16:35:38 it looks pretty but it costs me extra weight
help 2022-04-12 16:36:49 in my rather unreliable experience of pvp games, i never had my rockets explode on me
help 2022-04-12 16:37:31 ill take your word for it and place it under
help 2022-04-12 16:37:38 its lethal if it explodes there anyway
help 2022-04-13 09:30:47 ive basically made a eurofighter on steorids, should i remove the rods on the tip of the wings and nose?
help 2022-04-13 10:39:00 i motorlocked wing panels into the control panels
help 2022-04-13 10:39:20 its mouse-controlled, its pretty stable at 1300~ sps
help 2022-04-13 16:16:18 sorry for late reply. you mean the rudders?
help 2022-04-13 16:16:27 i used f-22-style rudders for the plane
help 2022-04-13 16:37:13 dont think i can fix that without any complications, its the best one i can come up without having to make another motorlock tower
help 2022-04-13 16:37:18 its for pvp, afterall
help 2022-04-13 16:38:11 it has a conveyor drive in it that i use to make the plane unstable with the click of a button, enhancing its turning for a second
help 2022-04-13 16:38:33 i will for the one that ill post in <#384025409945337856>

help 2022-04-18 17:35:24 yaw makes the plane point downwards, ive tried installing propellers to counter the spin or propellers to lift the plane's nose upwards, but none of it seems to work, let alone efficiently
help 2022-04-18 17:36:47 very helpful
help 2022-04-18 17:37:49 seriously though, i need some help
help 2022-04-18 17:38:04 first time putting drift in my plane
help 2022-04-18 17:54:50 right below the rudders
help 2022-04-18 17:55:22 i wanted as much yaw as possible at low speeds so i put lots of propellers for the yaw
help 2022-04-18 17:56:53 i found out that putting the rudders below the plane reduces the twist that points my plane downwards, but it looks strange when i put the rudder below the plane
help 2022-04-18 18:05:46 doesnt change things too much
help 2022-04-18 18:06:37 then itll spin because of the wing panels i have in front of the planes
help 2022-04-18 18:06:41 but ill try it anyway
help 2022-04-18 18:07:46 <@698587744842022983> very helpful, but now i cant drift the plane
help 2022-04-18 18:08:10 but i think putting some wing panels below the plane will fix the spin without having to get rid of my rudder

plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:20:34 i think i can modify it for the pic
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:21:07 you can use half wedge down, angle it, and motorlock it down to the wings
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:21:15 theres no easy way for it

creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:13:40 yea i pretty much based the plane off of this but i couldnt figure out how to make the 2d exhaust so i used jet engines instead, didnt really know that the j-20 existed until now

is there anything i should fix on the plane?
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:16:34 i wasnt aiming towards a pvp plane, but since it was more maneuverable than i expected, i decided to strap on some rockets under the wings

creations-chat 2022-05-14 19:22:12 feedback on crystal thing
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 20:38:22 literally all of them, but i only use the conveyor engine to make my plane unstable so i can pull off crazy sliding maneuvers
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 20:38:57 i use the hover engines to achieve a high top speed, while the rocket engines are there to prevent the aircraft from bleeding too much speed when doing tight turns
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 20:39:27 putting a conveyor engine in a motorlock plane is hard, but it is doable, hope this helps
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 11:15:32 probably a chain under the build with magnets attached, hence why the build is considerably thick
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 11:16:12 its also possible he used text since text blocks can weld but has no collision
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 19:13:30 i just use untracking rockets even on planes because of how shitty the tracking rockets are

plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:50:42 no
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:54:57 design
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 18:40:59 as long as youre using them for hover drives and not using them to make your plane float
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 18:41:38 theyre engines
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 18:42:08 they push back on motors to propel themselves forwards
general 2022-06-13 21:22:56 these are probably stolen accounts that have fallen victim of this scam, it reminds me of the opera boss from nier automata
the-dump 2022-06-20 20:24:35 an ai generated this image
the-dump 2022-06-20 20:24:55 you put some words into the textbar thingy and out comes an image
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:31:54 make it pink and name it the yamete
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:46:11 extra fps (feet per second) to your running speed

the-dump 2022-06-20 20:49:36 what did you put in?
the-dump 2022-06-20 20:49:49 im gonna try rickje
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:33:22 make a hollow tube, fill it with tnt balls, put magnets on one end and disconnectors on the other
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:33:48 the tube can be as big as you want, but i like mine 5x5
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:34:21 very effective against shredders and planes if you aim it very well
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:34:44 and as someone who mainly uses planes, these tnt shotgun cannons are challenging to take down, but possible
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:34:55 theyre deadly, too
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 16:42:50 I'd do the same
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 18:16:16 simple
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 18:16:18 don't
bot-central 2022-06-30 20:08:36 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:24:02 you probably have too much wing panels in the back, it lifts the back too much during flight (more speed = more lift), making the illusion of the nose being heavier
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:24:48 as for the tail heavy when slow, its probably weight, you should counter it with helium instead of with wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:25:11 i agree
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:26:57 try helium
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:27:04 maybe a lot of them will be required
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:27:46 the back
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 18:28:19 not with heliums if i remember correctly

plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:30:49 it apparently counts as modifying the game
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:40:01 a path to a new journey, for him, at least
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:41:00 all that matters is that he's enjoying it
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:41:07 everybody's gotta start somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:43:22 probably a new player
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 16:43:30 everyone has to start somewhere, my guy
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 16:23:58 on the dock near the water
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:47:49 can you fly inbetween them, though?
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:48:02 too much ace combat
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:48:16 and more optimized
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:48:36 i havent watch maverick, yet
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:48:56 fixed rockets?
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:49:16 how much, though?
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:49:26 if its more than 1 then people can cycle them
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:50:06 cannon should be as heavy as 5 ballast blocks, though
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:50:13 you dont wanna see them on planes
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:50:22 but people will find a way to anyway
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:51:12 ah yes, fix guns, too
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 07:51:24 just remove the yellow part and make it only fire the red part
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:35:54 rejoin
