plane-crazy 2022-04-06 01:03:18 far more effective if youre playing as a plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 01:03:33 fireworks as well but then youd have to pay for them

creations-chat 2022-04-11 22:41:19 that would be me being trash at flying not the plane being shit lmao
help 2022-04-12 03:41:07 motor 2
help 2022-04-12 13:28:26 I need some opinion should I change my harrier cockpit to this?
help 2022-04-12 13:28:35 or stick with this?
help 2022-04-12 14:46:54 damn everyone be saying the second one huh
help 2022-04-12 14:47:54 I mean it is how I intended it to be since its the harrier
help 2022-04-12 14:52:54 alright alright
help 2022-04-12 17:07:42 as someone who play pvp oftenly yes they do go explody
help 2022-04-12 17:08:38 perhaps use the weapons bay for tnt balls so you can kill ground vics
creations-chat 2022-04-14 20:30:45 I was just reading the feedback on the tank boutta say that it would be dumb that having cylinders as cannon guess I dont need to anymore
creations-chat 2022-04-14 20:36:45 tbh I feel like the tank is fine from pics Im finding online the only problem is that the turret seems shorter than it actually is
help 2022-05-01 00:15:31 any suggestions as to making the propellers closer to the wings without having a motor lock there
help 2022-05-01 00:17:16 yeah but then wing no pretty ;-;
help 2022-05-01 00:18:19 I mean Ik i have exposed motor locks but having one on the wings just feels odd
help 2022-05-01 01:00:59 welp I managed to hide the propellers instead by sacrificing rolling speed
help 2022-05-01 01:39:23 yeah Ill show you tmr but the wings are angled not as easy
help 2022-05-01 09:04:05 done it before you even said so
help 2022-05-01 14:57:33 I mean I already added propellers for pitch and roll and yaw before I even posted the pics
creations-chat 2022-05-22 23:01:32 cause I was copying this camera angle
creations-chat 2022-05-22 23:03:38 whatever you wanna say lol its the same jet ought to be similarities, if you hate it tell me where you hate it
creations-chat 2022-07-28 14:25:57 lol tbh Id change it to wing panels but already posted so people have to endure
creations-chat 2022-07-28 17:11:35 propellers and control panels
its a shit way to control yes
