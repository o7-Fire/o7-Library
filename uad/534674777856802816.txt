plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:11:46 Honestly I think they should bump the Max Save Data for some bigger builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:14:44 This may be going way to far but I think he should add different sizes.
Like modes of building.
We have  the regular size one, the ship size which is pretty wide but really long so we don’t have to add motors and some others or so
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:30 Plot sizes
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:45 I know
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:56 That’s why I said it may be going to far
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:20 He could also do like allow people to help you with ur build
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:34 Just giving some ideas
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:20 They are literally just called propellers
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:41 It’s been cancelled
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 12:19:57 Seriously that’ll be to op
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 12:20:16 The precise aim of it to
creations-chat 2020-04-26 00:51:34 Btw it’s IJN, not INJ
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 13:56:15 Has anybody built a working hovership that doesn’t require thrusters but only helium to make it hover?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 13:58:05 Well if you manage to balance the weight of the aircraft with the helium blocks then you’ll be able to make it hover without it going up or down
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:00:21 <@422221846491168812> well that’s why I also still used thrusters but the base hovering is just from the balancing weight of the hovership and the helium
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:02:16 That’s already done with thrusters and motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:03:43 Just a heads up I made the thing before the hover thruster update
There is no huge engine involved, only thrusters and super thrusters <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:03:59 With motors turning it
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:04:56 You need it to be balance on the 4 sides
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:05:11 Then put thrusters at a certain power to just make it hover
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:05:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:06:36 It isn’t always a rectangle it’s the weight distribution against the helium with symmetry of the said aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:07:03 Even hover thrusters can’t make it hover in one spot
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:07:31 ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:08:03 Yes?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:09:04 You might also need wings for added hovering as they are both can be huge and are light
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:09:58 That’s how I made my 2nd iteration of the hovercraft, using both engine / thrusters and wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:11:10 Well not really
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:11:27 Sometimes you may have to go outside that area in order to balance it
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:12:31 Since that plane of yours was only symmetrical on the longer side, it’ll leave it tipping backwards due to the weight on the back, leaving you to put more on the back than the front
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:13:23 I think that’s a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:13:29 It happened to me many times
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:16:48 It’d be actually pretty good if they added something like a hover rank where they have to create a hover ship that aren’t allowed hover thrusters and must be in perfect balance when not moving and hovering
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:17:16 Like not tipping forward or backwards
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:18:27 Well i guess
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:19:03 But still technically hovering
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:21:32 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:22:42 Aight gtg to sleep cya
general 2020-12-18 11:01:15 How do you get into the suggestion's chat?
general 2020-12-18 11:01:28 oof

Absolutely insanely amazing
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:25:13 Honestly to me I think the gun maybe a bit too long
