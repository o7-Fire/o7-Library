general 2023-06-02 06:49:14 i mean rickje is prob working on pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:50:45 i dont get what kind of godly pc do some people have to run a 500 part motorlocked build with like 20 anglelocks and piston locks at 200 fps
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:51:26 tbh its good but i think both of the angles are a little too steep for a perfect recreation
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:51:48 nah i get 20 fps with my motorlocked f-14
general 2023-06-02 06:52:47 i wish

plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:55:55 i think angle lock the top one in da picture until it reaches the end and it should be fine i think
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:56:16 its a nice wing tho
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:56:39 it is if the wing doesnt flatten out
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:56:55 oh yeah i cant send pictures
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:57:24 basically on the edge where the delta stops
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:58:31 lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 07:00:06 tbh im just waiting for image perms so i can post my creation in <#384025409945337856>

plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:10:36 i thought you were talkingabout the picture above

plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:11:01 its a toyota is all i know
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:11:08 or nissan
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:11:11 i forgor
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:19:17 look ok, i dont know how to make it smaller
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:22:58 how do you make the cockpit smaller without comprimising on looks and functionality, my plane is a WIP, so no intakes yet
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:25:31 yeah, that is true, it does look skinny, this is what the plane is supposed to look like, a very big cockpit, yes, i will make the intakes an actual part of the plane.
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:28:12 this is a google image but its about there(the wings fold in and the tails fold down)
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:30:25 it has those in the picture i sent above, but its 2d so you cant see the angle also i will prob angle lock the intakes üíÄ
angle locks make everything look better
general 2023-06-02 08:32:10 bro that t-2 looks more like a b-1 bomber ngl
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:35:19 that is true, cam lock does look better
but you see, i still need to figure out how to camlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:58:41 my an 225 legit spawns in, motors get locked back into original positions, then my ping infinitely climbs
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:58:49 no idea why
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 08:59:11 i managed to get to 500k ping before i got bored and left
help 2023-06-02 09:00:19 motors 2 wobble is just caused by wings being on a motor2 or an excessive force being exerted on it, or too much motors connected
