creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:37:47 How the fuck do I get image perms in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:39:49 To be honest that looks very cool though
general 2022-05-05 15:45:57 How do I get the images roles
general 2022-05-05 15:46:21 So I'm not supposed to embed?
general 2022-05-05 15:46:29 What
general 2022-05-05 15:47:03 Ah, thanks fam.
general 2022-05-05 15:49:01 Uh
general 2022-05-05 15:49:12 By the way
general 2022-05-05 15:51:56 Hey, can someone help me report someone in <#623337136267067393>
general 2022-05-05 15:52:08 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 02:35:02 What is this?
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:11:59 Guys
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:12:05 I have a pretty cool discovery
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:12:31 I call it "thrust vectoring"
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:12:42 I've never really seen it be done anywhere else
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:12:53 So I believe I'm the first to discover it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:13:13 The main pilot seat is disconnected from the rest of the craft
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:13:18 No, but not just that
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:13:31 It's mounted on a servo motor2
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:13:40 Which is anchored to the ground
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:14:09 No it has nothing to do with the engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:14:12 That's called gimbal
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:14:41 It really just tilts the main pilot seat to left or right
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:14:56 Because the main pilot seat has built in auto-stability
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:15:12 It will trick the game into thinking the plane is 90-degrees to the left or right
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:15:33 So it will take over the control surfaces and tilt it back to the original position of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:16:22 So you can have a  mouse-guided plane, whilst still having manual roll and auto rolling
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 03:18:47 It doesn't affect the plane's performance, but it affects the ease of use
general 2022-05-06 03:30:12 ADFX-01?
general 2022-05-06 03:30:34 Oof
general 2022-05-06 03:30:40 I forgot it didnt have the big engines
general 2022-05-06 03:30:48 Anyway
general 2022-05-06 03:31:06 Hypermanueverable Boeing 747
general 2022-05-06 03:31:52 That's not an ADFX-01?
general 2022-05-06 03:31:59 It doesnt have foldable wings
general 2022-05-06 03:33:09 Because they do
general 2022-05-06 03:36:25 bishop
general 2022-05-06 03:36:35 What's wrong with it
general 2022-05-06 04:01:43 So kill the gunner?
general 2022-05-06 04:01:50 Idk I dont play War Thunder
general 2022-05-06 04:05:34 Hello? Imposter? Is this the imposter from Amon Gus?
general 2022-05-07 16:47:56 Large builds are actually pretty busted if done well
general 2022-05-07 16:48:59 What's a "roscale"
general 2022-05-15 16:28:08 Guys this person decided to say that my ADFX-01 is an su-47
general 2022-05-15 16:28:13 And when I said it's not an su-47
general 2022-05-15 16:28:18 he just said "no"
general 2022-05-15 16:28:37 And when I told him the Su-47 doesnt have thick engines
general 2022-05-15 16:28:45 He said I built my "su-47" wrong
general 2022-05-15 16:29:38 He said that my "su-47" was built incorrectly because it has a giant laser on it
general 2022-05-15 16:30:19 Can I send it to you in DMS
general 2022-05-15 16:30:23 Then you send it here
general 2022-05-15 16:30:27 I dont have image perms yet
general 2022-05-15 16:31:32 <@411104247766056960> can you send it here now
general 2022-05-15 16:32:08 uhhh
general 2022-05-15 16:33:13 So this guy said my ADFX-01 was an "su-47", and I built it incorrectly
general 2022-05-15 16:33:26 He said it must be an su-47 because of the swept wings
general 2022-05-15 16:33:33 and the swept wings only
general 2022-05-15 16:34:15 "ooooh jet has swewpt winsg, must be su-47"
general 2022-05-15 16:34:39 Look I know it's not that good in the looks department.
general 2022-05-15 16:34:48 but at least I tried
general 2022-05-15 16:34:54 Just send it in dms
general 2022-05-15 16:35:18 I'd like to hear feedback, even if it's criticism
general 2022-05-15 16:36:06 I understand
general 2022-05-15 16:36:13 It's pretty good at PVP tho
general 2022-05-15 16:36:28 I agree
general 2022-05-15 16:36:39 I did jam 10 guns in the laser tho
general 2022-05-15 16:36:58 Im gonna send you proof he did in dms
general 2022-05-15 16:37:15 shoot
general 2022-05-15 16:37:20 I lost the screenshot
general 2022-05-15 16:37:27 That looks really good
general 2022-05-15 16:37:36 Im not the best at plane building tho
general 2022-05-15 16:38:14 But at least I'm not delusional enough to think that a plane that just has swept wings is an su-47
general 2022-05-15 16:38:44 And if it has any features that differs from an actual su-47 I'll just call it built incorrectly
general 2022-05-15 16:39:10 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-05-15 16:39:45 no

X-02S
general 2022-05-15 16:40:50 tbh I know nothing about ace combat, my bro just told me to build the ADFX-01 because it looked cool
general 2022-05-15 16:41:00 Zamn
general 2022-05-15 16:41:28 Yeah I know
general 2022-05-15 16:41:38 I know nothing about the plot, is what I'm tryna say
general 2022-05-15 16:42:24 How do ppl make things look so detailed tho? I'm impressed
general 2022-05-15 16:44:26 I personally think that builds just need to have passion to be good
general 2022-05-15 16:44:35 And some form of effort
general 2022-05-15 16:45:16 2 words. Motor-lock hell.
general 2022-05-15 16:45:44 By the way, how do you make test signs stick directly onto wings?
general 2022-05-15 16:46:25 Also, was anyone wondering what that seat was in this pic
general 2022-05-15 16:46:27 I can explain
general 2022-05-15 16:47:04 Murica

Frig yeah
general 2022-05-15 16:48:00 Are shaders considered hacks?
general 2022-05-15 16:48:06 I dont know, never used one before.
general 2022-05-15 16:48:32 Is he a mod?
general 2022-05-15 16:48:56 Damn
general 2022-05-15 16:49:20 That looks like a plane built out of 100% motor1s.
general 2022-05-15 16:50:24 o my godd he make amror pieccing discardeng sabow at home!!!1111!!!!1! he muss be arestted!111!!1 😱
general 2022-05-15 16:50:36 Jokes aside they look really cool
general 2022-05-15 17:28:28 What if people made battlebot contests where you are limited to certain amounts of blocks(and limited specific blocks like 5 motors max) and people just send these bots to battle each other
general 2022-05-30 02:45:19 Hi
general 2022-05-30 02:47:42 Go ahead, build a racecar
general 2022-06-10 15:15:18 Any suggestions on how to make motors stabler?
general 2022-06-10 15:15:33 Tryna make MG Excelsus blades that don't wobble around
general 2022-06-10 15:16:39 Haven't built anything yet
general 2022-06-10 15:17:31 Holy shit it worked
general 2022-06-10 15:17:51 They stopped wobbling
general 2022-06-10 15:18:04 I didn't know motorlock had that function too
general 2022-08-28 07:31:59 Do firework projectiles destroy rockets?
general 2022-09-05 06:48:50 Hi
general 2022-09-10 01:20:51 I'm not good at making thick wings
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:23:03 I'm not exactly the most professional builder
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:24:59 But is it possible for fixed-wing aircraft to achieve movement similar to noclipping
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:34 Hey
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:38 Quick question
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:50 Do you have a good understanding of propulsion mechanisms in this game
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:53 Because I don't
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:58 And I want to ask questions
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:33:32 okay that should be good enough
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:33:47 give me a moment
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:35:43 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Voda3FJHqyQ
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:35:58 Can you tell me if this is actually possible or just noclipping
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:36:22 Because as far as I can tell some guy just used noclip on a cube
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:37:02 <@953042156984086588>
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:37:45 two people kept claiming that "they gave him the tech to do that" or something
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:38:10 And then when I asked them to prove it they just gave an excuse like "nope im on mobile"
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:39:38 Also the same person was using a jet earlier
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:40:01 Except the plane had snappy movement, and when it moved the speed was constant
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:40:13 (just like no clipping!1!!!1!)
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:40:31 okay okay
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:40:57 Can you even propel a craft with pistons
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:41:09 And have it function like that cube
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:41:38 Because shit tells me that he just pulled out Synapse X
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:42:15 Also if this "tEcH" was a thing then why haven't I seen it documented ANYWHERE
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:42:51 I'd honestly be VERY delighted to see it in action if it wasn't just noclip
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:42:57 But he just pulled an excuse
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:43:09 So I doubt it's real
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:44:41 But I'm pretty sure it cant do a 180 while staying COMPLETELY stationary
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:45:13 Honestly the only way I can see this working is with an anchor block and some motor 2's
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:45:34 but the mechanism would probably be way too big to fit in a sukhoi
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:46:11 And it probably won't be very responsive moment either
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:46:23 Considering how the rotation was completely stiff
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:46:34 (Just like noclipping while sitting on a vehicle!!!!!)
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:43:50 You tell me, chief
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:44:16 I'm eager to know
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:47:50 Any ideas how it can be done?
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:48:26 But the craft was still like it's been anchored with an anchor block
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:48:45 And somehow rotated
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:49:09 Also i don't see any propeller engines here
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:49:28 No it turns while completely stationary
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:49:34 It pivoted in place
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:50:56 Movement would have been way to sudden to be those options
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:51:17 And yes he constantly went from 0 speed to 500, then back to 0
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:51:59 I don't remember seeing conveyors on the box
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:52:46 Also the crafts appear to be completely immovable by other people
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:52:55 Even when the craft was moving
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:53:29 If it used like helium there would still be some form of knockback if you tried to push it
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:53:44 And you can't use anchored blocks while moving
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:55:47 Honestly most logical answer would just be no clip
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:56:08 I understand that there's many shenanigans that can be performed in a game as weird as Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:56:12 But there are limits
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:58:19 Good to know
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:59:54 Go on, I'm interested
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:00:59 That's a good hypothesis
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:01:17 But it doesn't touch on the fact that it clearly doesn't budge when it was moving
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:01:55 Plus unlike in this one, the rotation was extremely sudden
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:02:29 And there's no real mechanism in that box that would even create any propulsion to begin with
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:03:28 Yet the box had the potential to drag a craft with 10-ish super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:03:35 With no real problem
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:04:15 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:04:18 That's interesting
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:05:19 How many are there?
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:08:57 I'm not exactly the most experienced person
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:09:20 But I don't think that engine is significant in any way
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:10:22 How so?
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:11:00 Mhm, but there's only one
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:11:20 Meaning that it can't exactly orient itself properly without some other mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:11:48 Also that would mean that the craft would just start spinning in circles if there was a slight imbalance
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:12:32 It doesn't have wings so it couldn't stabilize itself
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:13:53 It still had the potential to push an object even if the object wasn't in the centre
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:15:45 Because realistically it would have just deflected off my plane in an awkward manner
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:16:35 **U n l e s s   H e   U s e d   N o c l i p!**
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:30:01 I meant fly hack
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:30:04 Or something
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:30:11 Idk I'm not very familiar with those terms
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:30:35 Mhm
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:31:18 It's not exactly small
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:31:35 What are you making? Personally I think it looks very good
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:31:53 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:34:26 Now that's you mentioned it
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:34:36 If you slow down the playback speed to 0.25
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:34:48 There's a very distinct jittery movement
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:35:09 In comparison to the constant movement of my plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:36:13 The jittery movement can probably be two things but idj
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:36:24 1: the tp movement you mentioned earlier
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:36:44 2: macro-ing the shit out of an anchored block
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:37:52 I honestly doubt it's 2
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:38:46 If you can't make up your mind just motorlock it in between lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:40:35 Back is better
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:45:22 Nah can't join rn
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:46:50 Fair
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:46:58 I understand that it's possible
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:47:10 With what is basically a Reaction Control System
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:47:32 But I don't see any thrusters or gyroscopes on the cube
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:47:45 That help adjust the cube
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:48:23 How does one make a motorlocked gyroscope without the gyroscope completely breaking down
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:49:20 Also when I walked up to the craft when it was in build mode
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:49:28 I saw no thrusters either
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 03:07:56 It's possible to make chaff countermeasures but they're just way too bulky and inconsistent
creations-chat 2023-02-15 07:09:15 Really?
creations-chat 2023-02-15 07:11:43 This is how I got the camera angles lol
creations-chat 2023-02-15 07:18:58 I agree, no point having such a long cooldown in the CHAT channel

10 seconds is more than enough ngl
creations-chat 2023-02-15 08:00:32 Ok lol
creations-chat 2023-02-15 10:14:42 Vertical slabs???
creations-chat 2023-02-15 10:20:26 I dont remember placing slabs vertically on my ship
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 10:57:31 What do you guys think
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 10:58:32 I used motorlock to achieve this
creations-chat 2023-02-15 13:55:01 I honestly don't see any real problem with asking for help here
creations-chat 2023-02-15 13:58:16 Ima be very honest, just because you're not interested, doesn't mean you can go around and shush people that seek help
creations-chat 2023-02-15 14:06:27 Let's just all discuss in a more civil manner.
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:52:15 Have you tried making Reaction Control Systems?
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 03:52:43 <@779903334215450626> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system
general 2023-03-06 18:08:40 Roblox?
general 2023-03-06 18:08:52 Yeah fair enough
general 2023-03-06 18:09:43 Roblox cares more about me spamming "Hehehehaw" instead of someone wearing a shirt with the P###H## logo on it
general 2023-03-06 18:10:03 I kid you not
general 2023-03-06 18:10:11 That actually happened
general 2023-03-06 18:10:50 I got banned for 7 days for calling out a hacker named "Nickgeurslxave"
general 2023-03-06 18:11:10 Roblox moderation at its finest
general 2023-03-06 18:11:43 Not only did I get locked out, that kid noclipped my battleship into the void in WFYB
general 2023-03-06 18:12:03 Whatever Floats Your Boat
general 2023-03-06 18:12:06 By the way
general 2023-03-06 18:13:20 Imo Roblox should only reserve that kind of moderation where the games average less than like 200 active players
general 2023-03-06 18:13:52 Bigger games should implement some degree of anti-cheat
general 2023-03-06 18:14:58 And also maybe game developers recruit a moderation team that is tailored for said game
general 2023-03-06 18:15:29 Maybe once every month they send someone to check the game
general 2023-03-06 18:15:38 To see if it fits Boblos guideline
general 2023-03-06 18:16:13 Actually
general 2023-03-06 18:17:20 That's true
general 2023-03-06 18:17:35 Kinda sad not gonna lie
general 2023-03-06 18:17:57 Roblox has servers that run completely free
general 2023-03-06 18:18:18 And they have to make up for that
general 2023-03-06 18:19:26 Basically, "get told to fuck yourself" but with more steps
general 2023-03-06 18:19:55 And also add a bit of a 6-day wait time
general 2023-03-06 18:20:47 By the way
general 2023-03-06 18:21:12 The 7-day ban because of me calling out the hacker?
general 2023-03-06 18:21:22 Had to wait 6 days for a response
general 2023-03-06 18:21:45 "nope you're in the wrong"
general 2023-03-06 18:22:34 "our community does not allow slurring and I don't give a fuck that you were referring to a hacker's name"
general 2023-03-06 18:22:57 (slightly exaggerated)
general 2023-03-06 18:24:41 18+ Roblox accounts that MUST be verified with IDs and can only communicate with other 18+ users
general 2023-03-06 18:24:50 Okay this is stupid
general 2023-03-06 18:25:00 What the fuck did my brain just think of
general 2023-03-06 18:25:19 I am a peabrain
general 2023-03-06 18:25:53 Okay forget what I said
general 2023-03-06 18:26:44 I think the problem with Roblox is that you can't stop dirty-minded people
general 2023-03-06 18:27:04 No matter what you do they won't stop
general 2023-03-06 18:27:35 If you try and automate moderation with AI, it will cause unwanted collateral damage
general 2023-03-06 18:37:29 On second thought this may get me banned
general 2023-03-06 18:37:57 Screenshitted

plane-crazy 2023-03-13 08:30:00 I agree
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 08:30:02 It's mid
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 08:30:24 But to be honest I built it a long time ago
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 08:30:33 Still suck at building
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 08:31:52 Here's what I built recently. Still mid

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:58:26 So many pea brains walk up to my ADFX and use every remaining braincell they have and yell about how I made the Su-47 wrong
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 18:58:53 They will argue that it's an SU-47 until they fuckin die
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:00:22 Plane crazy air to air combat is stoobid
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:00:46 It's like cranking 90's in Fortnite

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:34:11 How are you using them
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:04:35 I should make a Chinese rocket because nobody does it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:04:40 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:04:57 I'm 14.
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:05:11 Well Starship is overrated
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:06:00 I'm literally making some rocket from the Long March rocket family because nobody did it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:06:05 *I hope*
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:09:07 Fair enough.
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:09:12 I suck at this game anyways
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:09:53 My really mid spaceship somehow got a positive upvote/downvote ratio
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:11:16 
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:12:04 But first I need to understand how the hell camlock works
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:14:18 I dont fucking understand
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:15:02 Thankfully I'm not the only one that's mentally disabled
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:25:39 Sure
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:26:11 Isnt that shit like dabbling with dark arts or something
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:26:58 Hmmm I wonder if I can crash Plane Crazy server by going so fast the speedometer gets integer overflow
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:27:24 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:35:32 lag machines are boring and obvious
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 06:40:22 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 07:07:17 Help
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 13:22:27 Why is thrust vectoring so shiddy in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 13:23:11 my thrust vector rig pulls down no matter which way I vector the engine
general 2023-03-17 13:59:48 Thrust vectoring in Plane Crazy is dog water
general 2023-03-17 14:03:44 It has the tendency to move the rocket instead of rotate
general 2023-04-01 10:54:13 I'm high on crack
general 2023-04-01 11:16:07 My brother in Christ you are a whitename too
general 2023-04-15 10:06:55 I doubt you can trust the numbers
general 2023-04-15 10:08:08 Hold on guys, let's use some braincelss
general 2023-04-15 10:08:24 Let's think of real sources
general 2023-04-15 10:08:41 Ok
general 2023-04-15 10:08:46 I'm just gonna like
general 2023-04-15 10:08:47 Leave
general 2023-04-25 01:59:39 Trying to learn camlock is giving me a brain aneurysm
general 2023-04-25 02:02:46 Who is even capable of comprehending such black magic
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 16:45:33 Why
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 16:45:44 Good
general 2023-05-06 10:07:50 Why are we just casually discussing politics here
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 08:00:45 Probably a large jet engine but the centre had some rendering problems
general 2023-05-19 17:19:38 Dann that is some serious BP editing
general 2023-05-19 17:19:55 How many did it take
general 2023-05-19 17:20:24 I'm incredibly impressed
general 2023-05-23 07:57:20 Build something cool I guess
general 2023-05-23 07:57:37 Build something big and hope people think there's enough motorlock in it
the-dump 2023-05-25 08:37:01 
the-dump 2023-05-25 08:41:44 i have like 275 hours in btw
the-dump 2023-05-25 08:41:54 Still can't wrap my brain around the concept of camlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:44:29 Apparently this is an Airbus Beluga chassis
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:45:02 looks a bit like a turd
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:45:57 It *kinda* does
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:46:49 Does this look bad in your opinion
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:48:27 I mean, he got the spirit
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:50:28 So what's angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:50:37 275 hours in and I still only use motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:51:35 Oh that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:00:34 By the way, what would you suggest if I need a strong, but low-lag thruster
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:00:41 (Doesn't need to be small)
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:15:24 idk
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:16:34 that's not mine btw
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:16:49 forger to tell you
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 09:17:45 yea it looks like it does
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:17:50 problem?
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:19:24 Here's a suggestion
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:19:34 If you cant find your math homework
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:19:40 You should probably get your shit together
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:19:45 And hop off discord for a while
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:23:22 Because age is a pretty decent way to prove someone's maturity
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:23:29 I rest my case
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:23:32 or dont idk
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:24:43 You do realise you cant find your math homework? maybe you should get your shit together
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:25:17 ok
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:25:37 cope
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:26:07 "Pretty decent"
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:26:30 Understood?
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:27:14 Try not to die
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:27:33 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:27:51 just dont die lmao
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:27:56 Im not sending a death threat
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:28:05 just dont get yourself in any danger
the-dump 2023-05-25 10:29:48 Interesting tactic
the-dump 2023-05-25 10:29:51 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2023-05-25 10:32:14 Im literally just not bothered enough to apply for ranks
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:35:05 Based on your current behavior we have a reason to suspect you are under
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:35:41 BAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:35:54 nothing really I just find it funny
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:38:32 how did the mods know tho
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:38:35 Did it work
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:40:07 Interesting
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:41:34 It's common for underaged people to ask that question
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:43:09 You've been pretty reluctant to send any real proof of you not being underaged
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:43:12 but I digress
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:48:13 Dead honest here
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:48:16 I have no idea what that means
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 10:49:25 But just for good measure
the-dump 2023-05-25 22:21:58 
general 2023-05-25 22:30:32 What the fuck
general 2023-05-25 22:31:06 Man feels like waiting for TWW building update
general 2023-05-25 22:32:08 Then why the fuck did you say you want to give it away here
general 2023-05-25 22:32:48 Then don't fucking talk about giving it away here
general 2023-05-25 22:33:49 So that person from the Forza server is named "no one"?
general 2023-05-25 22:34:49 So wdym no one claimed it
general 2023-05-25 22:36:01 Understandable have a nice day
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:02:05 You have spawn protection for some time when you start a build
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:02:41 Also, anchor blocks are kinda funny
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:02:56 They will anchor the blocks that are attached to them
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:03:08 Until you turn off the anchor
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:03:37 So if you use a disconnector to disconnect a block and an anchor block
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:03:58 The block will still be anchored even though it's technically not connected to the anchor block
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 06:04:12 Only way you can stop this is to turn off the anchor
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:17:09 Im goig to ptu a pip bom into rivkjes mailbox if he dosent tell me when playne crezy two come out
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:17:12 😡😡😡
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:19:13 Nooooooo
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:19:17 😭😭😭
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:19:56 It sucks that so far I've only learnt how to use motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:20:04 275 hours into the game
the-dump 2023-05-27 00:23:27 
general 2023-05-27 00:24:09 275 hours in and I still suck at plane Crazy
general 2023-05-27 00:27:52 Read
general 2023-05-27 00:28:31 The info channel
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:37:39 No idea
general 2023-05-27 00:38:38 That's not even CGI
general 2023-05-27 00:38:55 That's just 4 images slapped on a video
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:40:22 **I'm working on a ship that would sink dynamically instead of just disintegrating while staying afloat**
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:41:44 I think a combination of helium blocks and ballast blocks will work
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:42:40 Basically the Ballast tanks are so heavy that the only way it's staying afloat is because of the helium blocks located right above them in the hull
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:43:15 So all it takes is some damage to the hull and the helium blocks can be deleted, so the ship would sink
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 00:44:57 Kinda like how breaching the hull below the waterline of a real ship would make it sink
the-dump 2023-05-27 02:27:16

plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:03:03 You're better off entering a 30-G turn instead of doing funny maneuvres
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:03:46 I just gave up my hope that it will even exist
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:04:39 I have an F-14 I'm too lazy to colour properly
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:05:09 And the funny thing is
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:05:13 It's dog water
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:06:01 Honestly it sucks how nobody has made torpedoes yet
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:09:19 But they just often steer off-course
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 02:09:40 That's why it was so hard to perfect torpedoes IRL

plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:15:34 It happens to us sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:30:00 They kinda do
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:01 My brain too smol
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:06 Cannot comprehend
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:37 So what's this
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:41:03 The tail fins look like they gon snap off from just cruising
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:42:13 If it's in space why is there an air intake on top
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:43:08 Mhm
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:43:35 Gotta let that nothing into the rocket engine to combust the fuel with
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:44:55 What
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:47:13 
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:47:20 Nitrogen would be a liquid at that temperature
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:47:35 Actually let me check
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:47:44 I'm not done
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:47:50 I think I screwed something up
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:49:27 Okay but we were talking about how realistic it was
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:49:52 Also I'm pretty sure that space is a near-empty vacuum
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:50:17 If it wasn't I don't understand why people need to use rocket engines instead of electric props
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:50:57 Okay whatever you do you
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:51:15 Probably not
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:51:36 I'm working on making a funny yacht that can sink when you break the hulls
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:52:09 Because it's boring when ships stay afloat even though they're in a million pieces
general 2023-05-28 05:53:50 I don't think that's a rant, more of you slamming the keyboard recommendations
general 2023-05-28 05:53:59 Because as far as I know that makes no sense
general 2023-05-28 05:55:52 It started off with being hungry, then the Fr#nch, iJose???? Then hungry again, then iOS
