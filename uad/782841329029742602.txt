bug-reports 2022-03-18 04:16:40 ok, thanks
creations-chat 2022-03-22 06:36:20 wonder why is there guns on the side of the plane (wait which one are you talking about?)
creations-chat 2022-03-22 06:39:42 ok but why is on the side, can't you put it inside of the plane instead?z ovuxozyv9pewyq49wrsaoidzxv
creations-chat 2022-03-22 06:45:09 don't all trains have them?? --Have they blacklisted you?
creations-chat 2022-03-22 06:59:28 i think it is intentional, not a glitch
general 2022-03-25 15:05:46 to bad the report system is not here anymore
general 2022-03-25 15:06:23 i just saw mosaic p_ in plane crazy pvp
general 2022-03-25 15:12:58 oh, i never knew you would reply to it. Uh I think there is nothing we could do lol
creations-chat 2022-03-26 08:58:39 how do I post images? (rip i'm not lol)
creations-chat 2022-03-26 09:11:14 the only way to gain levels is to be more active in this server? k
general 2022-03-26 09:47:32 shredders have no shame lol
general 2022-03-26 09:48:15 i mean shameless?
general 2022-03-26 09:48:21 eh
general 2022-03-26 09:48:51 i remember a shredder user who does not give a f about opinions about shredders
general 2022-03-26 09:50:06 I also remember a person who says they use shredders when they are targeted??? I think that person is just a kid
general 2022-03-26 09:50:58 ngl, it feels like the new meta are shredder jets
general 2022-03-26 09:51:07 not those classic shredders
general 2022-03-26 09:51:14 idk??
general 2022-03-26 09:51:45 For some reason, I thought they go in 1 in modern times
general 2022-03-26 09:52:01 like I often see shredders that go so slow
general 2022-03-26 09:52:37 and used by children
general 2022-03-26 09:53:30 I think shredders are not the only meta, any kind of flying machine that is super maneuverable and fast are meta
general 2022-03-26 09:53:58 I remember a helicopter that has those pros, all of the people in the server can't chase him
general 2022-03-26 09:54:29 does not work for pvp planes
general 2022-03-26 09:54:44 no shit
general 2022-03-26 09:55:27 damn
general 2022-03-26 09:56:49 i met a shredder user who also used a lag machine, an annoyance
general 2022-03-26 09:57:25 did you see me with the checker patterned plane?
general 2022-03-26 09:57:43 of what?
general 2022-03-26 09:58:02 mine can go 1300?
general 2022-03-26 10:01:11 super rocket engines are better than rocket engines and jet engines. However, use a hover engine instead since it does not have  any drag
general 2022-03-26 10:09:22 why are you always trying to come up with excuses from your ass
general 2022-03-26 10:10:26 Let me say again, why are you always trying to come up with excuses from your ass?
general 2022-03-26 10:11:10 You can but excuses aren't bulletproof
general 2022-03-26 10:11:22 i think of the same thing
events-chat 2022-03-26 10:16:32 fr im mutted for creating a pointless argument while this pointless argument is still going in general ðŸ’€
events-chat 2022-03-26 10:17:06 idk
events-chat 2022-03-26 10:17:31 im lucky lol. can you tell the other people in general to come here?
events-chat 2022-03-26 10:21:50 <@!849557593046777886> You still think I'm a goner, I am still back
creations-chat 2022-03-26 10:31:19 they could have used the wing space to make bombs... They have enough room right?
general 2022-03-26 10:32:12 cool im back
general 2022-03-26 10:32:21 I was muted for a pointless argument lol
general 2022-03-26 10:32:48 even though the whole argument was pointless lol
general 2022-03-26 10:33:43 I made this account when I was 10 ðŸ’€
general 2022-03-26 10:33:50 of course I made this
general 2022-03-26 10:33:56 like thaat iouvopzxucv
creations-chat 2022-03-26 10:36:50 now lets compare it with a real image
general 2022-03-26 10:41:10 funny enough, the only medthod for using motor lock is understanding patterns
general 2022-03-26 10:42:57 for bending motors, you make a motor tower perpendicular to other one?
general 2022-03-26 11:05:17 so people are in the creations channel are unsmart, neat
the-dump 2022-03-26 12:34:34 I win
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 12:36:32 you could try to use super rockets
general 2022-03-26 12:37:58 it feels like they are two different things
bot-central 2022-03-26 12:38:14 !rank
general 2022-03-26 12:39:11 but they are the same thing, like a non-euclidean world
the-dump 2022-03-28 01:30:23 im sorry what
