plane-crazy 2018-11-02 13:48:27 I made the mistake of making my first plane a vtol
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 13:49:14 But it goes 416 at top speed so I guess its was worth the hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 13:50:36 Sort of
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 13:52:11 I'll get photos later if requested
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:49:30 So uhh

creations-chat 2018-11-03 18:28:07 
creations-chat 2018-11-03 18:34:24 forgot to mention, both variants have a different style of bumper and gun
creations-chat 2018-11-03 18:38:21 
creations-chat 2018-11-03 18:38:30 
creations-chat 2018-11-03 18:38:52 the  military variant's gun can go up or down via piston
bug-reports 2018-11-03 21:08:36 saving any vehicle using the color value 200,200,200 will result in any block with that value turning a lavender purple when loaded again

help 2018-11-06 23:06:43 I need help making a folding runway
help 2018-11-07 12:54:39 <@233666698715070465> your heli isn't countering rotation
help 2018-11-07 12:55:16 Use a second blade that rotates in the opposite direction
help 2018-11-07 12:55:31 Or a prop engine  on the back
help 2018-11-08 22:19:03 Rockets are broken
help 2018-11-08 22:19:30 They disappear when fired
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:04:52 Rockets are broken and my saves are corrupted
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:05:07 Rockets just disappear
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:08:30 Joined the game and tried to load them
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:08:38 So I built a plane
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:08:44 And added rockets
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:08:52 And went to the arena
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:09:15 Then realized the rockets disappear when fired
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 14:26:40 In going to wait for the patch
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 14:27:30 Hopefully I get my contest project back from corrupted save hell
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:29:25 A bunch of people probably lost a ton of time from corrupted saves
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:29:38 And some contest submissions
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:31:32 The anchor block freezes the entire creation
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:31:54 <@305738900427505664>
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 14:35:40 <@260534086400081920>  i thought the other pilot seat does that though (in relation to your submission)
creations-chat 2018-11-09 14:44:49 I  want to make a spider mech later
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:59:25 Uhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:00:01 You know
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:00:09 It freezes itself
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:00:25 So any blocks connected stay in place too
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:01:30 Yeah everything still moves, but the anchor block keeps it in place when activated
bug-reports 2018-11-09 23:09:53 That may explain why all my saves are corrupted
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:48:55 can any rank that states any means necessary allow for helium?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:14 yeah the suspension started to slow me down at high speeds so now im using pure helium blocks
general 2018-11-11 21:29:06 the most recent was about people joining and saying they don't like it within five minutes
general 2018-11-11 21:34:19 lol this game sucks (snort) they can't even update it every second lol
creations-chat 2018-11-11 22:07:36 Help
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 22:09:22 im now at 1.7 + speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 22:12:20 at the speed i'm accelerating at it'll take me three years to get to the speed of light...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 22:13:24 lol how do i accelerate stupidly fast
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:25:57 somebody give me a link to a new server
creations-chat 2018-11-12 01:13:06 Lightspeed, please

plane-crazy 2018-11-12 13:09:33 I wonder what's the largest vehicle that hit lightspeed was
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:14:09 Oh you mean a lag fest
help 2018-11-12 19:15:37 <@243490235265056769> use a half wedge
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:25:54 I'll pass on this contest
general 2018-11-12 19:33:30 RIP stan lee
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:40:42 There only needs to be one magnet
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:41:03 As they work on blocks directly
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:41:43 There you go
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:42:35 Fore warning it gets laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:43:53 Though use ice blocks on the bottom or wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:44:52 Ice blocks have reduced friction letting you move easier
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:45:21 Normal wedges share the same friction value as normal blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:57:21 Orange its already happened
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 20:53:31 oh damn
bug-reports 2018-11-13 19:28:09 Laggy server
the-dump 2018-11-13 20:32:36 suck

general 2018-11-14 01:06:37 <@456226577798135808>
general 2018-11-14 01:07:20 yes
general 2018-11-14 01:11:32 oh i have the rank already
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 01:45:08 im still playing the game lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 01:45:25 also the trucks made by a company
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 01:45:41 and owned by said company
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:18:50 Every day there's always one dude who goes afk in front of my creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:19:11 Weirds me out
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:19:38 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:22:01 The Boeing 777 has folding wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:36:11 Yeah their servers are having issues
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:43:55 Ram blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:57:13 What'd be nice is wheels with suspension in it already, for smaller wheel based creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:05:21 Cease your stop-ing
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:10:04 Yeah roblox said on Twitter that they are looking into it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:12:58 Seriously though, some form of melee block/blocks would be cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:16:26 Gamer we get it you cant connect
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:40:16 If melee blocks are added i could make missiles
general 2018-11-14 18:40:53 Stop
general 2018-11-14 18:40:59 Just stop
general 2018-11-14 18:41:05 No d
general 2018-11-14 18:41:14 I hate this bot
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:41:38 Or a saw
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:42:04 Yeah but it dies actual damage
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:22:29 discord -90% asmr,
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:22:44 -10% underage kids kids
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:26:24 AHA
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:26:46 YOU CAN GET AROUND THE CONNECTION ISSUES BY JOINING A SERVER DIRECTLY
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:27:36 because they are having issues starting, and picking servers to join currently
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:28:01 but by joining online servers directly you can get in
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:28:18 the servers tab
bug-reports 2018-11-14 20:38:29 it seems that if you try to start flying a vehicle for a second time once in a server it won't let you
bug-reports 2018-11-14 20:43:38 nvm it just my vtol it won't let my fly
bug-reports 2018-11-14 20:49:18 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZdgdJiKIh8
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:01:52 does anyone know how to get vehicles to spawn?

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:07:09 i just got back on to build and then "game shutdwon in 122 seconds"
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:56:02 I've been using ad block
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:56:14 It works on roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:57:36 Idk why
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:57:54 But when I was younger I thought adblock was illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:58:26 You assume I age now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:59:04 I'm immortal
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:59:21 For it's me, Dio
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 17:59:01 uhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:25:58 No me no dumb
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:29:20 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:29:39 But color is not a rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:29:50 Therefore you have 2
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:30:44 All ranks that apply as a proper rank are grey
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:31:47 I might apply for mod later
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:32:07 <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:32:29 Lol jk it's a question
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:33:03 Use half slopes
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:34:35 They dont block placement at the end of the cover
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 14:35:47 <@118113664636157953> put them at the edge of the wheel arch
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 22:38:18 Its called <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:39:26 so what does finding all the parts do?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:57:39 OwO killed my mother board
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:53:17 it is fun, but not for weak computers
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:53:53 semi open world
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:54:18 it has 4 maps but you can go anywhere on them
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:54:51 and they are like 100km-100km to 25km -29km
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:55:26 and you can get workshops maps that are 500km x 500km
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:56:29 and bohemia  has a decent dlc system
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:57:57 you can ride in vehicles but not crew them if they are dlc, you can use weapons and other equipable's but you'll get a 10 second advert about what you used before you leave if they are dlc, the only thing you can't do is play on dlc maps.
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 17:24:06 oh
