plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:24:05 o noes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:25:44 I say it looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:26:31 I got a super fortress
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:26:38 Meant to overkill any shredder or omni
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:27:08 You should add that
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:27:29 Also 1x7 beams are somewhat good as an alternative if needed
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:27:57 I do all the time
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:28:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:28:18 It can't
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:28:33 I'll give a list of what I know tnt is invincible to
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:28:53 Rockets, guns, fireworks, cutters [good]
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:29:26 Never knew it was good against fireworks too
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:29:36 Fireworks are quite op air to air
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:29:53 Depends how good you are
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:29:59 I had it on an old CF-5
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:30:19 True
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:30:28 I got a better flak cannon though
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:30:40 Just a tnt cannon works just as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:31:04 Thats why I just get all 150
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:31:06 and send em
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:32:16 Depends on the target
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:32:27 I've ended quite a few planes with fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:32:59 I use a hybrid of both
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:33:17 But I lean more toward the mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:33:53 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:34:59 It's true
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:35:14 In what kind?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:35:26 I just got a good ol nuclear bomber
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:35:52 How do you guys get to send images lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:36:03 I want to show my super fortress and ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:36:40 ***l u c k y***
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:37:09 Oh the original ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:37:15 Those do next to no damage
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:37:48 My super fortress could easily completely smack all dem shredders but its rare to see one
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:48:21 Theres a lot of ships around
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:48:39 They use emojipedia
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:48:56 I got a 6 fold zeppelin carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:49:04 But it looks odd from the outside
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:49:18 xD
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:50:20 Ima have to wait till I can send images before I can get ranks prob
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:51:42 Thats gotta suck
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:53:38 I got a 3.1K block uncompleted battleship
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:53:46 And some other ships
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:56:32 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:56:54 Legacy glass*** cursed***
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:57:56 Guess you wanna see out of it without all the glitch from regular glass?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:59:09 I suggest using regular glass for a more clean look then but your choice
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:02:25 Thats why I use pictures and sketchfab lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:06:26 Use sketchfab if you wanna build anything with real accuracy or at least some other website with good 3D models
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:06:55 Ok

creations-chat 2021-08-29 22:36:49 But its meant to look like the irl one like the other tuts and showcases so can't really be saying much here
creations-chat 2021-08-29 22:42:14 Ever heard of anger therapy?

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:49:42 I wish I could build even 1% like that lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:50:03 My brain would implode and turn into a black hole trying to make that
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:50:24 STEALTH
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:50:37 What is it for?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:50:43 I love the stealth to it
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:50:59 Get slapped shredder users

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:54:00 I’ll also likely name it HMCS Centrusion, the weird name is for historical reasons
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:54:28 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:54:39 Hehe boi
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:56:22 My friend dislikes French guns I guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:57:45 Fling them.
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:58:49 Meme.
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:59:05 French would probably put 5 if they could
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:59:10 But yeah they do 4

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 05:59:40 That ship is an absolute unit
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:00:44 The colour for the wing kinda looks oddly mixed with the paint but it’s pretty cool

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:14:23 My front turret got blown to bits
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:14:35 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:14:49 That can be even deadlier with motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:15:16 Yeah lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:15:23 That could be a mobile fortress
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:15:43 Or stealth kamakazie
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:17:44 Suicide but hidden
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:18:04 You can just make a motor lock bomb and boom
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:18:10 You use a tank
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:18:13 Or a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:18:28 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:18:49 Just *hidden*
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:19:22 It could be if it goes fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:19:44 Or your fps is just dog water
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:19:50 Are you sure?

the-dump 2021-11-14 06:22:10 E
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:23:50 Maybe make the submarine metal so it can dive easier
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:30:38 Well you ain’t gonna learn how to make a car without making one lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:30:47 Show me a picture of one of your cars
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:30:53 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:31:04 But you gotta make more then one quote obviously
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:31:16 Should’ve constructed that sentence better
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:31:28 I love my 1:34am brain

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:31:49 Now I see why
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:32:05 Yeah stick to subs please
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:32:29 I would like a submarine protecting my ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:33:34 That’s kinda better
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:34:03 I would use some sparkler and put a gun in front of it, use a 1x2 text block to connect and bam it looks cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:34:35 Looks like a cargo jet but vtol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:34:40 Cool though
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:34:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:34:52 What does it carry?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:35:16 Jeez that’s a lot of cameras good for durability though
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:35:41 This is my destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:35:51 Not fully detailed yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:36:02 Working torpedos too though
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:36:35 Yes it’s based off an irl ship
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:37:01 That looked like my destroyer at first glance
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:37:33 The smoke stacks are quite weird but cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:37:36 Yep

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:41:41 WaR cRiMeS
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:41:59 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:42:25 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:42:32 People think plane crazy is irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:42:42 Probably because they think plane crazy is irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:42:48 Likely flat earthers
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:43:07 Sick
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:43:33 I would maybe add some bombs that come out of the side as maybe a mine layer or somethin
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:43:49 Yes.

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:47:14 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:47:22 I do motor locking and a bit of angle locking
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:47:37 It is quite painful at times with small builds mostly
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:48:11 Gl
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:48:54 I hope you don’t have a life then because you’ll be devoting it to learning motor locking for the next month
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:48:58 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:49:20 JEEZ that’s gonna take a trillion angle locks
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:50:00 Pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:50:37 I need to find one of my motor locked builds rq

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:30:53 Because of a gun glitch
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:31:09 Happened to me when I was slapping shredders with my tank

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:54:28 Otherwise it’s rare
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:54:57 Motor lock is annoying but worth it

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:12:15 The standards is motor locking pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:12:41 At the very least you should be able to motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 16:12:54 Yeah but I am just trying to say for most

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:21:02 Why does the ships tower look like an Iowa for some odd reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:21:18 Well practically all American bridges are like that anyways

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:43:28 I’ll post
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:43:38 F
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:43:50 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:43:54 Could this manage?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:43:59 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:44:00 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:44:00 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:44:25 I modified them a bit for more durability
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:45:02 I won’t have enough sparklers
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:45:11 Since I used them on the aa guns too
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:45:38 No
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:45:53 I’d consider it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:46:09 Lemme get me next to one of the guns rq
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:46:30 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:46:34 This might be ro scale
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:46:54 Uh oh I forgot some bits on it lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:47:21 I could use something else I guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:47:28 Like the black circle emoji
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:47:41 That works well for my ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:48:01 I normally use sparklers for aa since they mix well with a gun in front
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:48:25 Just connect them with a 1x2 text block then your good
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:51:10 4x bigger from what I know of
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:51:20 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:51:54 54x54x39
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:52:32 Big.
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:52:43 Hopefully it’ll all be 216
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:52:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:53:06 The Richelieu tower is very tall so I gotta hope it’s 216 tall
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:53:12 Same
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:53:21 It’s cancer making good battleships with the plot size
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:53:30 Always gotta scale them down
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:54:00 At least motor lock helps with stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:54:07 And folding
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:54:21 I chain locked the tower of one of my batttleships
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:54:40 Though it was a failed project due to ugliness
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:55:37 Uhh I don’t really think so but since the game will be soft coded, so maybe? Thing is people will love to troll others via deleting their builds but there’s ways to avoid extreme damage
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:56:09 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:56:21 But reports will be filled to the brim with people mad at trolls
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:56:28 Won’t end out well
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:56:32 HELL YEE
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:57:05 Plot size carriers?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:57:49 There’s ways to get around the build limit by having people build segments and combine them together but gl moving an inch without going to the next millennia
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:58:01 Yes.
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:58:11 Eject into the propellor blades
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:58:51 Oh jeez
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 23:59:15 That’s good be absolutely mind numbing to make the tower fit without it being tiny
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:00:56 I can already tell that scale might be too big unless your a motor locking god
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:01:16 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:01:20 Plot size can go OOF
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:01:51 You’ll be 80 when you finish, I’ll buy you a wheelchair though
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:02:22 That gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 00:02:37 Time to build a huge damn wheelchair in plane crazy-

plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:26:55 I would show how I folded mine but I can’t rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:27:18 That’s good
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:27:39 But care to explain why the waterline uses diamond plating?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:27:43 I would use slate
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:27:58 With some cobble
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:28:07 It’d add good texture
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:30:35 the controls for control panels get inverted when you spawn at water and airport too(I think)
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:30:52 But I know control surfaces are flipped when spawned in the water
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:31:07 Uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:31:25 
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:31:35 Give that man 8 15” high explosive shells
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:32:02 Nope.
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:32:17 Gotta get lucky with laggy servers
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:33:09 That’s a feature
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:33:17 I think
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:33:40 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 20:33:55 No that’s normal for me

plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:50:41 Richelieu Class "Fast-Battleship"
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:50:45 
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:55:40 Its a battleship
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:55:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:56:01 Without decor at the moment
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:57:53 They are cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:57:58 I love the quad barrels
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:58:36 Though they are pretty much 2 double barrels in one housing
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:58:40 As you can see the spacing
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:58:52 
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:58:59 They are legit 2 double barrels combined
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:59:02 15"
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:59:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:59:30 Pretty good i'd say for a ship that goes 31 knots
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:00:27 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:02:32 Also all I did was just made it at a smaller scale lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:02:44 Due to plot size
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:03:08 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:03:18 I am adding details once the hull is done
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:03:31 So I don't lose motivation detailing for an eternity
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:03:57 ***Blow them up***
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:22 Hm.
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:30 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:57 I don't think you can really tnt armour wings tbh
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:02 Which are quite important
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:22 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:39 Only good on large bombers or any large plane in general
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:50 Then goes turtle pace
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:06:14 I use speed and agility as my jets armour
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:06:41 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:06:55 My jet would turn into a motor locked messed if hit prob
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:18 I use it for tanks and some parts of ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:26 Including what you said
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:41 yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:45 Ima show my jet rq
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:08:01 I'm pretty bad at jets btw lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:08:09 What is it with people and french ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:08:30 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:08:55 Also so did britian, and russia, maybe germany and america too
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:09:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:09:12 Because they are good
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:09:24 Without being as long and slow
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:09:47 It goes 32 knots
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:10:23 
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:10:47 And lemme tell you why quad barrel guns are actually not b a d

A warship that I’ve made to combine looks with functionality (PVP)

(Zacattack got the footage of my warship btw)
creations-chat 2022-08-25 06:17:07 Very accurate
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 17:49:30 Hm
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 17:51:10 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 17:51:27 Is the helicopter just meant to be eye candy?
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 17:51:34 Or would it be used for proper pvp
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:34:59 Hello there
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:35:17 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:35:20 Indeed
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:35:37 Any ideas on how to improve this? (I got a trailer, not in this photo)
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:35:48 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:35:51 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:36:20 Aight
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:36:42 The missile tubes kinda look ugly too
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:36:49 The truck is meant for PVP warfare
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:37:02 It carries two extremely deadly anti ship missiles
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:37:15 A singular hit can do this
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:38:33 Hello there
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:38:55 Congrats
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:39:09 Welcome to the half dead place called Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:39:28 The truck is capable of firing missiles across the map
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:39:35 And you won’t be able to spot the missile in time
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:39:41 No no
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:03 I’m not the best at spotting jokes
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:05 Mb
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:25 Mhm
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:40 Sometimes you’ll find people who help
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:42 It isn’t often
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:40:57 I despise those people
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:41:20 Damn < / 3
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:41:24 It didn’t even stand a chance
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:41:29 There goes my poor truck
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:42:08 I don’t think new people can post pictures immediately
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:42:20 Gotta get to level 3 in chatting first
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:42:55 Just chat for a while
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:42:57 Do !rank
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:02 Check your level
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:09 Or not
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:15 Should be <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:39 Just send it in our DMs then
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:43:43 Or chat
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:45:09 real
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:45:26 Sure
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:46:14 A picture of one of my PvP ships
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:46:29 It's beefy
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:46:45 It has that below deck that I enter during battle
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:04 I can't move or everything moves in slow motion
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:08 It's 5.1k blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:20 Of course!
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:25 It's a naval standard
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:40 I'd say it looks good since you're new
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:47:46 It could use some better paint
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:48:09 Gotta do them cobra maneuvers in modernized battleships

plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:49:29 y e s
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:50:02 Add decals to the wings, maybe invasion stripes for epic trolling?
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:50:24 Any aircraft?
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:50:34 True
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:50:45 Yeah, Mirage is quite simple
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:50:57 Mirage would be a good starter
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:51:13 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:51:14 Here
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:51:20 Use blueprints for more accurate designs
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:51:24 Or 3D models
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:51:55 I have a supersonic bomber
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:52:18 The bomb it carriers can cover the entire plains in explosives
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:52:23 It's amazing to watch ngl
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:52:28 Then find another
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:53:08 Bi planes are relatively simplistic
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:53:28 Let me find a picture
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:53:49 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:53:52 True
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:04 Requires angle locking to make the wires and all
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:13 But it doesn't need to be perfect for a first aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:27 Go for it, then
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:38 Then do the Mirage F1 next
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:41 So on and so forth
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:54:57 WW2 fighters are a mehhh
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:55:34 Everyone makes that-
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:55:57 Good luck on that
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:56:09 Imma go work on detailing my missile truck some more
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:56:15 Maybe toss some pictures around here and there
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:56:33 the youtube tutorials :agony:
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:56:54 Show me a picture of what you intend to improve
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 15:57:39 Uhh
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:37:27 It’s a PVP warship, those are like that for a reason
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:40:31 Take into consideration that motor lock makes weak points for durability, and durability is needed for it to survive in PVP. Plus, the weaponry will stay the same because that’s how it fights back, but I might fix some of the radar areas. Also, the stern has large cruise missiles, so it does look quite bland there
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:50:43 If you don’t care, I don’t see why you’ve given other reasons
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:52:59 And my warships are built to be combat capable against other warships, not just mope around looking pretty
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:55:07 So… your saying balancing functionality (pvp wise) and looks isn’t some form of creative challenge? If so… I’m not too sure what you’re on about so imma just let you say what you want since you won’t be very helpful
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:17:33 It seems as if they’re mocking you for being a furry, if that wasn’t obvious enough as is. People just tend to look at the questionable furries and go “all bad”
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:22:50 Sounds about right
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:25:34 Uncanny how he asks for compassion when he completely dissed somebody earlier and complained how they got more upvotes than him
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:34:10 So… because something has some similarities to your build means it should have the same upvotes? Huh?
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:36:36 You’re clearly implying said thing but sure
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:09:39 ship
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:12:12 y e s
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:12:21 I might post another ship in creations
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:12:26 But idk which ship to choose
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:12:43 This?
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:13:09 Imma need to get better pics of it
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:13:24 Prob add some more detail too
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 18:13:46 wait
