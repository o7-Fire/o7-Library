creations-chat 2021-07-12 01:57:06 Ik but it looks to big to even do folding and still have it fit

help 2021-07-12 02:06:23 I looked and I couldn't find it
help 2021-07-12 02:07:00 Wait I meant inventor
general 2021-07-17 16:36:02 Did you guys know if you use hover thrusters on your build at 0g that it will hover perfectly anywhere
general 2021-07-17 16:36:52 I found it by accident when I was building something
help 2021-07-17 16:39:59 Hey for anyone who is building a hover craft or a space shit and you have the gravity slider gamepass this too will help you alot to make something hovering and how you do it is you put hover thrusters on your creation the more the faster you stop and then when you launch set the gravity slider to 0 and you fly up on the sky and wait for you to come to a complete stop and you have got the easiest way to make a hovering creation
general 2021-07-17 16:41:31 How to get imagine role
general 2021-07-17 16:42:48 You half to be a nitro person or get it from a mod if they give it
general 2021-07-17 16:44:08 Tbh idk
help 2021-07-17 16:53:21 If it doesn't make since there your stupid
general 2021-07-18 02:55:45 I just realized they don't really care if you swear anymore
general 2021-07-18 02:56:01 I remember when they didint allow it at all
general 2021-07-18 02:56:23 Not that I recall
general 2021-07-18 02:57:15 Oh you talking about chicken nuggets
general 2021-07-18 02:57:19 I see
general 2021-07-18 02:58:47 But who would of known my first ever pixel art would almost get me a expert designer rank
general 2021-07-18 02:59:02 See
general 2021-07-18 02:59:02 
general 2021-07-18 02:59:15 If I of got 7 more I would of got it
general 2021-07-18 02:59:48 But that was like a week ago I bet no body will see it anymore
general 2021-07-18 03:00:53 No it only says 90 upvotes they just don't count the person who uploaded it or the bots
general 2021-07-18 03:02:25 You got the whole chat laughing
general 2021-07-18 03:04:14 Your stupid right that is referring to up and down votes it's not saying down votes subtract the total of upvotes
general 2021-07-18 03:04:55 Alot of people use that to refer to multiple things
general 2021-07-18 03:05:25 But I guess you wouldn't understand because you don't listen to rules that's why your banned from suggestions making
general 2021-07-18 03:06:02 I can read just fine
general 2021-07-18 03:06:11 You just need a brain
general 2021-07-18 03:06:54 So your saying even the mods don't know about that
general 2021-07-18 03:07:34 Because I got designer IV and if you subtracted the the down votes from the other picture I would of had under 70
general 2021-07-18 03:08:17 No the - means it's referring to up and down votes
general 2021-07-18 03:08:43 Even ask a mod I bet he will say same thing I am
general 2021-07-18 03:09:16 Bruh it's to show who don't like your creation
general 2021-07-18 03:09:38 Plus it's mainly to show if it belongs in the hall of fame
general 2021-07-18 03:11:09 1 trillion
general 2021-07-18 03:11:49 How the hell was that spamming
general 2021-07-18 03:12:00 All I did was make a large number
general 2021-07-18 03:12:30 Nah it's 21
general 2021-07-18 03:12:34 Lol
general 2021-07-18 03:12:49 You missed the joke
general 2021-07-18 03:13:49 At least I don't live in my parents basement on a computer 24/7 and the only time you see them is when you eat 20 pounds of candy
general 2021-07-18 03:14:21 Nah
general 2021-07-18 03:14:54 Lol I find this funny I love making toxic 9 year olds mad because they don't understand things
general 2021-07-18 03:16:13 Ik I've been wrong multiple times but ik I'm right since if I wasnt the mods wouldn't of gave me designer IV with the screen shot I took when I requested it
general 2021-07-18 03:16:35 Because I had 72 upvotes with 10 down votes
general 2021-07-18 03:16:45 And for proof I'll send the picture
general 2021-07-18 03:16:49 
general 2021-07-18 03:16:50 See
general 2021-07-18 03:16:57 Wait wrong one
general 2021-07-18 03:17:04 
general 2021-07-18 03:17:09 Wait
general 2021-07-18 03:17:17 I got my album mixed uo
general 2021-07-18 03:17:18 Up
general 2021-07-18 03:17:24 
general 2021-07-18 03:17:26 There we go
general 2021-07-18 03:18:17 Are you color blind
general 2021-07-18 03:18:47 Because if you could see color you would see it's a donut
general 2021-07-18 03:19:29 Your probably support LGBTQ with the way you act when you know your wrong
general 2021-07-18 03:20:26 Your wrong because if down votes did subtract the upvotes you would of seen that I wouldn't of got designer IV
general 2021-07-18 03:20:49 I will when he admits he's wrong
general 2021-07-18 03:22:24 It's not just a minuse sign it's used for multiple different things and if you read the sentence right you would see if it meant subtraction that it would of made no since
general 2021-07-18 03:23:23 Bruh how am I crying over down votes when I'm simply explaining that down votes don't subtract upvotes
general 2021-07-18 03:24:23 Btw the correct term for this symbol - is called a dash not a minus sign
general 2021-07-18 03:24:53 It's used as a minuse sign in math ways but it's called a dash
general 2021-07-18 03:25:03 I'll prove it even
general 2021-07-18 03:26:37 Wow I wonder why this minuse symbol looks like a dash
general 2021-07-18 03:28:05 Its saying upvotes and down votes since <@707133341454958604> thinks a dash symbol is a minus symbol when it's not unless if your doing something with marh
general 2021-07-18 03:28:41 I'm sorry but I don't like to swallow my red white and blue American flag
general 2021-07-18 03:29:52 So then explain how I got designer IV if it takes 70 upvotes but I also got 10 down votes so it wouldn't of counted
general 2021-07-18 03:30:29 Ive been standing this whole time talking to my family
general 2021-07-18 03:31:18 Nice photo shop
general 2021-07-18 03:31:53 Since if you got to <#609442446249820211> you don't see the upvotes and down votes arrows
general 2021-07-18 03:32:35 But brb I'ma get a mod to prove the kids wrong
general 2021-07-18 03:33:37 You realize they don't use that for ranks right
general 2021-07-18 03:34:23 Explain how I got designer IV from my Pixel art if down votes subtract it
general 2021-07-18 03:35:10 Lol so your saying all the mods do errors because I've had other accounts that were done with the same way
general 2021-07-18 03:35:39 Nah they were old accounts
general 2021-07-18 03:35:48 There not in the server no more
general 2021-07-18 03:36:44 They were old accounts that are now alts but they no longer are in the server I only use them for testing with servers I design
general 2021-07-18 03:37:25 You must be stupid if you didint understand that
general 2021-07-18 03:38:18 But since the kid who started it left I rest my case cya I'll let you guys at rest
general 2021-07-18 03:38:39 Oh fuck he's back
general 2021-07-18 03:39:57 And it takes 70 to get designer IV
general 2021-07-18 03:40:42 I never said I was pro there's others who are way better then me I'm only a beginner
general 2021-07-18 03:41:20 Wow your really removing a rank I earned
general 2021-07-18 03:41:38 So Mature
general 2021-07-18 03:42:22 Who gonna tell him it's not 2020
general 2021-07-18 03:42:42 Your stupid
general 2021-07-18 03:43:35 Why are you stupid
general 2021-07-18 03:44:32 Why because it's the truth
general 2021-07-18 03:44:56 This one
general 2021-07-18 03:45:27 Designer IV that water removed
general 2021-07-18 03:46:00 This was one I first applied
general 2021-07-18 03:46:10 The other one was most recent
general 2021-07-18 03:47:35 It's 70
general 2021-07-18 03:47:54 Look in ranks and see it's 70
general 2021-07-18 03:49:17 They never said it couldn't be pixel art they only said it needs at least 70 upvotes and has had effort in build it
general 2021-07-18 03:50:26 Pixel art*
general 2021-07-18 03:51:00 And I designed the pixel art soo
general 2021-07-18 03:51:22 I designed it in game
general 2021-07-18 03:51:34 How would you know
general 2021-07-18 03:52:14 But also with every 1x1 block placed
general 2021-07-18 03:52:41 It took my a while to place every single 1x1 block
general 2021-07-18 03:53:17 I put alot of effort in it because as again I've never designed a pixel art
general 2021-07-18 03:54:02 So I'm not a master at pixel art
general 2021-07-18 03:54:51 Wow I got warn for being toxic when I'm speaking facts but I'ma go go because these mods rn suck
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:00:23 Hi
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:01:17 Are you really trying to talk with a bot
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:14:08 Type $new in this channel
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:14:49 Now you present proof to them and you say what rank you want
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:15:17 But it can take up to minutes or hours depending how busy the mods are rn
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:15:51 Oh
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:16:10 Then wait till someone responds then send it to them in a dm

bot-central 2021-07-18 07:16:48 !rank

bot-central 2021-07-18 07:18:16 No I was looking to see what my rank was
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:18:22 I never checked it till now
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:18:40 Oh
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:19:02 Oh ok
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:19:51 But now just keep an eye on discord for someone to respond like I said it could take minutes or hours depending on what the 2 online mods are doing
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:20:54 Her expired how did you get inventor role
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:21:32 Oh neat
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:22:02 I don't really make huge complex systems I mainly like building
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:22:42 Soon I'll be building a custom made jaeger base off of pacific rim
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:23:15 I forgot what bipedal walker was
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:23:40 Oh I remember now
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:23:53 I haven't messed with walkers in a while a while
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:24:03 I was mainly working on things that fly
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:24:23 Lol the black glass behind white glass
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:24:32 It's not 100% one way
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:24:33 Doe
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:24:56 You can still see the sky and and a shadow of the person on the other side
bot-central 2021-07-18 07:25:19 I've tried all the designs and if you look close enough you can
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:26:50 Nice
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:27:18 Oh you designed a land creation
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:27:24 Oof ikr
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:27:45 Thankful they don't force you not use helium for mechs
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:27:59 Other wise they be near impossible to make
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:28:15 Well to get the 2000k block goal
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:28:25 I mean 2k
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:28:36 I'm tired I'm not thinking straight
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:28:49 Yea but for my mech I'm making rn it isn't
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:28:55 
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:29:00 That's over 2k
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:29:17 And no I did not make it on mobile
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:29:23 I would be dead if I did
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:29:50 Because it takes me forever to make heavily detailed things on mobile
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:29:56 Since I'm use to computer
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:30:15 But tbh I'ma delete the mech and remake it
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:30:29 It's torture
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:30:37 Don't ever play Roblox mobile
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:30:51 Well I will when I get a new hard drive for my pc
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:30:59 My mom killed my old one
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:31:35 She unplugged it when I was doing software management on it
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:31:38 And it dked
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:31:40 Died
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:31:48 So it a killed the hard drive
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:32:11 That's why you never turn it off or let it die when it says not to
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:32:43 It might not happen all the time but of you do it one to many times it will reck your hard drive
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:33:03 Plus i needed a new one anyways
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:33:21 Either that or Google made Roblox run slow
bot-central 2021-07-18 08:33:46 Since a bad hard drive can cause a computer to run slower if it's bad
creations-chat 2021-07-18 08:37:47 Why the hell not
creations-chat 2021-07-18 08:39:48 It says it should not that it has to
creations-chat 2021-07-18 08:43:13 It only says should not that it has to
creations-chat 2021-07-18 08:45:14 Yes should. But I'm not gonna make a big deal about it so I won't do it again
general 2021-07-20 20:49:20 Hi
creations-chat 2021-07-20 20:50:50 What do you think of my mech it's not finished but I'ma redesign most of it and I wanted other options on it

general 2021-08-19 11:40:13 So if you scream I am a banana at the top of your lungs about 25 times at 3:25 am that a weird shadow figure called a parent will most likely kill you
general 2021-08-19 11:40:50 So moral of the story idk how TF I'm alive
general 2021-08-19 11:41:16 Sometimes 30
general 2021-08-19 11:41:42 Depends how many neighbors and real parents ya got and how loud it was
general 2021-08-19 11:42:53 But imagine no mods being on rn
general 2021-08-19 11:43:44 Well then you should get a mega phone that will make the whole world hear it and you possibly get a free space ride to the sun
general 2021-08-19 11:47:34 https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRNSEy5X/
general 2021-08-19 11:48:01 Bruh the stuff is creepy

general 2021-12-17 00:07:27 Eh what do you expect though since all work is on pc 2
general 2021-12-17 00:07:56 Can't wait for it but I still want updates
general 2021-12-17 00:09:29 Hopefully with the soft coded version he will make a while listening script and also let the maximum player count higher
general 2021-12-17 00:10:13 Yeah
general 2021-12-17 00:11:22 This so called infinite map would be nice
general 2021-12-17 00:11:52 Depends on how it works
general 2021-12-17 00:12:21 Maybe they will make it only load depending on where you are at
general 2021-12-17 00:13:10 But look at scrap mechanics infinite map
general 2021-12-17 00:13:33 It only loads if you're close enough
general 2021-12-17 00:14:30 Hopefully by fourth of July
general 2021-12-17 00:15:15 What would be awesome if they released it on December 25th as a Christmas gift
general 2021-12-17 00:16:13 Just make a new account with New email
