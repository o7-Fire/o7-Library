creations-chat 2021-11-09 14:10:05 also shld i keep the wings straight or slanted?
help 2021-11-25 07:18:11 how do i get this to work its yawing way too much
help 2021-11-25 07:19:18 aight wait a sec
help 2021-11-25 07:23:16 https://streamable.com/ne7x87
help 2021-11-25 07:23:28 im not using anything to yaw
help 2021-11-25 07:23:51 im heading up and down but using the loose motor i can see the yaw
help 2021-11-25 07:25:20 but the blades are actually 1x4 wingpanels to allow it to sortof not collide
help 2021-11-25 07:25:49 so i cant technically use ctrl surfaces
help 2021-11-25 07:26:04 ill try anyway
help 2021-11-25 07:28:32 yeah
help 2021-11-25 07:29:40 ill replace the 1x4 with ctrl surfaces ig
help 2021-11-25 07:32:37 ok it seems the yaw problem is fixed
help 2021-11-25 07:32:41 probably...
help 2021-11-25 07:47:15 nvrm i guess its just gonna be unstable
creations-chat 2022-01-13 14:41:28 thx
creations-chat 2022-01-13 14:47:46 Also yeah I couldnt think of a good colour scheme for the plane it self so erm... I went with chrome white a nice shade of blu and dark grey XD
creations-chat 2022-01-13 14:52:25 It's fine its, its definately fine
creations-chat 2022-01-13 22:50:09 <@401476384947568640>  yes I used pistons for 2 reasons no 1 I used it for suspension dont judge me and no 2 I had limited space and thus could not make the gear full length and still fit inside the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:25:23 tru dont rly have good colour palate choices never have and probably never will and yeah the railings are a good idea leme see
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:31:02 <@!720751430595772418> looks good
creations-chat 2022-01-22 05:28:39 working on a new ship (battleship) whats your opinion on this main gun mount so far? (replace cylinders with disconnector barrel)
creations-chat 2022-01-22 05:31:10 initially it was based loosely on the yamatos prototype gun mount so the triple 410 mount on the izumo class battleship it instead looks like the yamatos gun now sigh* gun also keeps getting stuck or just slowly depresses its angle very problematic ah this gun
creations-chat 2022-01-22 05:35:30 actually now that i think about it shld i create the hull first?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 05:42:59 in regards to my last image in this chat about a battleship tripple mount turret forget that imma just do a cruiser easier
help 2022-01-22 06:00:00 ok need some help which design for the hull of my cruiser should i use the tnt is for use against torpedoes there is a gap between lower deck floor and hull bottom for higher survivability againt mines ig i dont know what im doing anymore (this is lierally because i dont know which hull design to use the left one is easier to angle lock at the bow and stern but the right one provides someextra protection on the hull bottom bc there is a tnt blk nearer to the center
help 2022-01-22 06:17:08 aight then thx
help 2022-01-22 06:18:06 hallelujah i now have a purpose time to see where this project goes

help 2022-01-22 06:25:53 mein gott verdammt
help 2022-01-22 06:26:32 clear evidence that i am in fact brain dead
help 2022-01-22 06:28:18 also how long should the bow be?
help 2022-01-22 06:29:25 i think 33(+-1) is fine right?
help 2022-01-22 06:55:46 ok <@!744591826891046943> ive made this(to my standards) way too complicated
help 2022-01-22 06:56:44 
help 2022-01-22 06:59:22 yes
help 2022-01-22 06:59:30 i just made a few changes
help 2022-01-22 06:59:51 the motor lock there shouldnt be exposed now wait a sec
help 2022-01-22 07:01:23 also ignore the exposed lock near the centre back of the hull
help 2022-01-22 07:33:58 krist i this is your carrier correct?
help 2022-01-22 07:34:24 nice
help 2022-01-22 07:35:19 i didnt finish this carrer so i never posted it
help 2022-01-22 07:35:33 but its one of my best designs so far
help 2022-01-22 07:36:32 any advice for the superstructure?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 14:40:53 aight
creations-chat 2022-02-25 05:01:16 Aight got it yeah was gonna use the base norfolken colours (look at my previous builds my SST) and yeah abt the gun elevation I have no way to really limit it bc I'm using motor 1 so if I'll switch to motor 2 also the elevation was for a meme I forgot to undo it
help 2022-03-06 14:00:36 sry can someone help idk where to place the blue
creations-chat 2022-07-03 02:04:12 This is a carrier I'm working on right now anything I can do to improve the silhouette or even the angled flight deck? Apart from filling in the deck
3 plots long
Almost a plot wide
1 folding ramp for stol aircraft
2 planned catapult
No elevator since the hull height is actually quite small
3 platforms for small weapons
1 planned arresting wire
1 planned folding barricade
<@779482180924997682> aight I'll try that out I'll get back to you later
creations-chat 2022-07-03 02:37:10 Aight I'll try to fit one in

creations-chat 2022-12-13 10:02:48 Sorry ik only replying now but yes I agree with that, the name was derived from nur funken which in english I'm told is translated to just sparks and I just changed it from nurfunken to norfolken
creations-chat 2023-01-15 14:33:12 Feedback? Ignore the trap doors they got caught turning mid picture
<@678279674782285824> can you elaborate? What can I do to add more detail?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 14:37:49 Not in particular no it's a custom
creations-chat 2023-01-15 14:40:23 Mind dming an example? This slow mode is annoying man
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:42:41 Aight thx
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:42:46 I'll give it a try
creations-chat 2023-01-24 13:57:32 sry yeah the camo positioning was changed as well but on the other side so yeah I guess the update wasnt rly necessary
creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:23:09 XD ah i see what youre trying to do there
Nice one
creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:27:23 yeah some shit i cant rly hide
creations-chat 2023-02-13 14:54:01 this is meant to be a carrier section but I'm stuck on where the Drones should launch from? the sides? below the craft? or above it with a hangar on the top deck of it
creations-chat 2023-03-13 04:19:02 agreed
creations-chat 2023-03-13 06:43:19 i mean that with how people in public servers do it, they have 4 motors turning each wing individually and that results in a not very x like formation of the wings the way i have it set up, i have only 2 motors tuning the wings on the same axis so it forms an x leme see if i can find an example rq gove me a sec
creations-chat 2023-03-13 06:49:08 1st image 2 motors to pivot
2nd image 4 motors to pivot
If im right this is what the show means by the s foil aka the way the wings are articulated or moved rather
creations-chat 2023-03-13 07:29:42 yeah ik the t85 has a different canon rotating style
and also if we use 4 motors to move the wings on the same axis, its kinda just redundant innit?
creations-chat 2023-03-13 07:32:27 wdym?
creations-chat 2023-03-13 07:37:42 ah ok
creations-chat 2023-03-13 07:39:54 the way i did it was have hover engines farther forward in the fuselage
i basically decided screw simplicity, whats a couple more lost braincells?
creations-chat 2023-03-13 07:43:03 yeah
creations-chat 2023-03-20 23:02:33 Use 1x1 delta wings instead of 1x2 deltas for the leading edge of the wing, its a lot more accurate although it's what most people would use, the wings you have right now look goofy ahh and dont fit the f15 at all
creations-chat 2023-03-26 23:24:16 <@439659689610051585> decent build although could be better. Or maybe I'm top used to 1 block wide fuselages
help 2023-05-26 14:50:59 hey what do yall suggest i do for my helicopter's blades?
i cant use signs because they seem to still result is some drifting
help 2023-05-26 14:52:04 wing panels will cause even more drag and forces it to drift even more
help 2023-05-27 02:37:03 Thx
help 2023-05-27 04:44:12 As of right now I havent been able to fit propulsion in yet I'm currently using max drag hiver thrusters to reduce the drifting
help 2023-05-27 04:44:27 But now I also have the issue when flying for some reason it rly lives to bank to one side
