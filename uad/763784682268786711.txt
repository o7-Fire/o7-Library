plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:52:47 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:55:19 they are easy really,somewhat
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:56:14 is it weird I though that was a harrier?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:04:08 1 by 2 or 1 by 4?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:04:33 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:04:50 Let me check my new republic bomber......
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:07:17 68
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:07:23 mine has 68 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:04:18 I want to see this work now
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:06:03 Does it work right now?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:10:01 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:17:05 New compitition,rubik's cube
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:18:53 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:19:04 Who knows the stud size?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:19:18 Is the stud size half a foot?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:20:02 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:20:34 Reak life
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:20:42 And0.05 meters is
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:21:34 R/technicalythetruth
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:21:50 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:22:11 I was about to say 5 centimeters
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:22:39 I used a unit converter
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:22:51 How did you get ~2 inches?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:23:26 okay...
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:24:52 Trying to find how fast in plane crazy you have to go to reach super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:25:16 So I think I divide 1126 by 12
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:25:24 Is that right?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:25:39 SPS
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:25:59 right
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:26:54 I was going to get the wrong answer then
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:27:16 Cause FPS for super sonic is 1126
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:27:22 and I was going to divide by 12
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:27:27 then multiply by 2
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:28:12 What is the divide symbol?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:28:27 is divide ~ ?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:28:38 mk so I was thinking
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:28:58 (1126/12)2
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:29:06 That seems way to high
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:29:59 No not that
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:30:09 Let me do the math
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:30:19 Aka caculator
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:31:13 I think you are correct
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:31:21 Time to try and reach that speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:31:28 Want to also try?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:31:46 How many people have gone super sonic in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:32:09 I am then going to do my damn best the become the first
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:32:44 @ him
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:32:59 So two projecs
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:33:04 rubics cube
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:33:11 and super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:33:22 I will record if I reach super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:37:15 Well
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:37:22 one is the actual round
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:37:41 and the other is either another round or a train
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:37:43 trail
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:37:54 I am trying to super sonic however
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:38:02 So I cant debate this
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:38:47 Question
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:38:59 What is the fastest speed ever recorded in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:39:37 I have reached 10,000 speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:39:55 And I have to reach 8,000,000
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:40:16 And I have entered the glitch zone
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:41:30 In lamen terms
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:41:59 And what is that
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:42:06 150,000
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:42:13 No the actual number
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:43:09 this is where I am at in the warp zone
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:43:17 So people have gone super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:44:43 This is at low 100,000 speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:48:12 This is just low 200,000
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:48:22 I cant even see my player model at this point
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:49:02 so super sonic is possible
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:49:16 But I might have to restart to add more **sped***
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:50:32 My roblox avatar (Top down view)
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:50:39 this is only at 270,000
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:54:22 Got to 400,000 sps then my game crashed
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:57:09 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:57:13 Make what I couldnt
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 01:57:17 A super sonic rig
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:06:38 What fasted reported speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:06:41 the rig?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:20:20 What is the fastest someone has went from 0 to 1000 sps?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:20:54 Im going to stream my attempt to go super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:22:05 How fast are they?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:22:59 Watch the stream
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:46:38 So...
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:47:15 I am gonna make a cannon system

plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:57:54 How is this me?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:58:52 Very big words for a very stupid person
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:58:55 sus
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 02:59:11 Steps to a supersonic cannon
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:00:09 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:00:15 Where did all those messages go
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:00:44 ***yes***
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:01:35 steps to a supersonic cannon:
.Cannon
.Cannon firing mechanism
.Way to measure the speed of the projectile
.Magic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:12:41 My cannon fires but is not super sonic
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:12:55 Nor does the magazine work yet
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:26:56 Finally
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:27:09 Should I make the cannon shoot explosives?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:27:28 Especially if its small
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:27:37 Smaller shrapnel
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:27:43 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:14 A block is...
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:36 Going by previous math
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:45 A block is 4 inches
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:30:18 I dont know what these do
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:32:10 And what does ***Besh*** mean?

plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:16:47 I made a cannon with a magazine
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:21:01 It is very slow
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:21:08 Like me when I am doing a math test
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:35:14 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:35:16 Winter?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:40:13 Should I make the cannon shoot explosions?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 01:40:19 *Explosives
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:23:35 Is it not used for planes?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:28:19 like in real life

plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:51:06 I just used the reg blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:52:05 Im going to test weight
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:56:30 Hold up
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:56:43 Each block dosent have a weight of .28
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:56:49 It has a density of .28
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:57:40 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:57:46 I have it figured out now
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:57:59 Each block should weigh about 1.86 pounds
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:58:32 I am not talking about material conversions
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 00:00:35 Hold up

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:42 36 studs per second is 25 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:02 in human scale,for 1 stud is 1 foot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:11 the roblox character,unchanged,is 5 feet tall
