general 2020-06-30 12:12:57 Guys what does 2k pilot seats do
general 2020-06-30 12:13:17 So u have one with red seat right
general 2020-06-30 12:13:21 Thats the main
general 2020-06-30 12:13:32 Im talking about the ones that you can get
general 2020-06-30 12:13:35 The blue sits one
general 2020-06-30 12:13:36 Yes
general 2020-06-30 12:13:56 No i mean what do they do
general 2020-06-30 12:14:05 Do they function the same as the main pilot seat
general 2020-06-30 12:15:19 Tank plane
general 2020-06-30 12:16:22 I build tanks instead of planes
general 2020-06-30 12:16:27 I cant build a massive plane
general 2020-06-30 12:17:33 Whenever i made a plane bigger then 120 blocks it’ll function like gmod ragdolls
general 2020-06-30 12:17:38 If you get what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:18:20 The carpet
general 2020-06-30 12:18:40 *i have a lot of ideas but every idea leads to failure*
general 2020-06-30 12:18:52 Like a massive blimp
general 2020-06-30 12:19:13 I cant even build a crane
general 2020-06-30 12:20:12 I cant even make a plane like that
general 2020-06-30 12:20:24 The only thing consider successful is an atv
general 2020-06-30 12:20:45 Even so it controls like crap
general 2020-06-30 12:21:32 Joe
general 2020-06-30 12:21:35 Joe swanson
general 2020-06-30 12:21:41 Bruh

general 2020-06-30 12:24:00 A wheelchair isn’t a wheelchair when it dont have **a dozen of super rocket boosters**
general 2020-06-30 12:25:05 > I CANT READ SHT

general 2020-06-30 12:28:07 Since i can make a very small plane i hope i can land it on a aircraft carrier that random people own
general 2020-06-30 12:28:59 Beanos

general 2020-06-30 12:32:08 But ok
general 2020-06-30 12:32:59 Furry is people trying to be like animals
general 2020-06-30 12:33:17 You put cat like feature on a tank doesnt mean you are one
general 2020-06-30 12:33:19 I know
general 2020-06-30 12:33:42 Hybrid
general 2020-06-30 12:33:56 Furries are idiots wearing fur suit
general 2020-06-30 12:34:01 2 different things
general 2020-06-30 12:36:46 Same
general 2020-06-30 12:36:49 They are so weird
general 2020-06-30 12:37:24 Sad
general 2020-06-30 12:37:42 Well some furries are chill but i still do not like them
general 2020-06-30 12:38:41 If they want to become an animal, let them be
general 2020-06-30 12:39:01 Just tell them to beware of hunting season tho
general 2020-06-30 12:39:32 The furry community is weird as heck
general 2020-06-30 12:40:21 No you dont run
general 2020-06-30 12:40:30 Grab the nearest ar 15 and start shootin
general 2020-06-30 12:40:44 Weeb community is fine
general 2020-06-30 12:40:49 Most dont do harm anyways
general 2020-06-30 12:41:24 Ah frick what did they do
general 2020-06-30 12:41:45 I dont want idiots grab a massive box and cover my base

general 2020-06-30 12:45:49 Doesnt matter
general 2020-06-30 12:45:54 **i am flexible**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:47:00 Wait so the black list thing is useless now
general 2020-06-30 12:47:07 Hi
general 2020-06-30 12:47:55 Taste like stone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:48:49 Why make the black list box collidable? Just make it a massive kill block that kills the certain blacklist user once he touched it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:49:49 I know
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:50:15 The spinning cutter kinda ruined the fun for others
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:50:45 Imagine spawning and all your wheels are gone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:50:57 True
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:51:26 But what if they make the black list box a kill part that would destroy the part of the certain users build
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:51:37 Once their plane touched it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:52:44 Yeah
general 2020-06-30 12:53:19 Yes because they are efficient
general 2020-06-30 12:53:38 Some mangas have like 100 pages
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 12:54:07 But pvp is a way of flexing your build in power
the-dump 2020-06-30 12:55:14

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:27:52 Unless your motor is inside the build

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:29 If that gone your build go bye bye
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:08 I like plane crazy as a designing game other then pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:52 Base on yourself is much easier since you would know the structure of your build
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:30:09 If you base on something thats hard

creations-chat 2020-09-05 15:43:49 Its not a 3 wheeler when you have 2 tiny landing gear on each side

creations-chat 2020-09-05 17:24:19 It does better at balancing n stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-05 17:24:47 Then make gaps between the body and the wheel
creations-chat 2020-09-05 17:25:06 Also you can make one side of the back wheel roll faster then the other so itll turn
creations-chat 2020-09-05 17:25:20 And can u not cap spam you make yourself look like an idiot

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:07:11 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:10:44 It looks ok but the leg is too long from your angle
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:11:26 Honestly a tank does better then a mech
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:04 They are smaller, can equip flexible weaponary, and looks badass
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:14 Ok what about hover tank
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:20 Now mech dont have an advantage
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:41 Honestly mech irl could be very energy comsuming
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:50 But yea titanfall mech are good
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:40 Tanks have a fixed turret
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:51 But mech expensive tho
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:06 The price just dont worth it
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:40 Ok thats actually very long
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:15:17 Honestly ill just imagine the mech will have a short body and long arms and legs

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:16:48 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:17:04 I mean mech looks badass when doing poses
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:17:16 But they have no other tactical advantages
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:17:33 Yes multirole
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:17:51 Anime mechs are good
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:04 Its just if you try to build one irl most likely its not worth it
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:26 I mean if you want to destroy half of the district yea
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:28 Its good
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:50 Just look at transformers
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:55 They have mech like bodies
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:19:05 And they destroy half of the city everywhere they go
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:19:28 So yea imo mechs are a big waste of money
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:19:46 Dont build one in real life unless you complain about having too much money
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:20:06 Elon build rockets

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:25:44 If you destroy the turret the tread can help it run away
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:25:50 Unless you destroy it entirely
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:26:28 Rocket gun
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:29:03 Short mech have smol hitbox
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:29:23 Big mech most likely implodes when try to do anything
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:29:58 Exo skeleton are cool mech

creations-chat 2020-10-08 09:07:15 Fold a rocket/ firework inside the barrel would do
creations-chat 2020-10-08 09:07:33 But thatll make it a tank instead

creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:37:58 Meh
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:51:16 Its pretty nice already, i would suggest to smooth the bottom of the boat using wedges
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:56:43 Ok now thats great

For me i would put wedges horizontally because thats the angle most people would see, but this is also fine, i like it
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:59:25 I agree, but if you making side angle screenshots its best it use horizontal wedge

Im not saying vertical is bad, both placements have its pros and cons
creations-chat 2020-10-31 16:24:45 Wait what does your ship looks like

I mean he could mistake it as a uss texas

Your builds are not determined by how well they were built its determined by rng
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:30:35 Random Number Generator

I would suggest doing heckler and koch guns like the mp5
creations-chat 2021-01-15 08:01:45 The zebra texture feels unnecessary

creations-chat 2021-01-15 08:26:47 That thing looks like what most player build in every public servers
creations-chat 2021-01-18 12:03:22 1143 blocks for a shredder would kinda be death for it, consider its size

I know it since i have the same layout on one of my early plane

I suggest make the alleyway wider so you could actually walk on it
creations-chat 2021-01-30 14:40:30 I would rather just make the general train wider, like 7 blocks instead of 5
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:55:46 <@!701408431856418866> it looks too pale for an actual cruise ship

If you decided to make a big plane do u start from the nose or the body
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:15:17 pcc is well known for the 2 brain cells combined when it comes to criticising builds
creations-chat 2021-04-11 08:10:12 I dont see whats so funny about downvote being upvote and upvote remains as upvote

Its feels dumb and cring
creations-chat 2021-04-11 08:13:32 bruh its just bricks with proper shadows
creations-chat 2021-04-11 08:26:53 Its still bricks with oiled surface

The colour and shape literally looks the same without shaders
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:21:31 What do u use to move it?

I would suggest replacing your current engine with a simple conveyor engine

I try using a single conveyor on my 2.2k block landship on water and it moves like 70 or something
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:42:40 I remember i have trouble trying to synchronise the thrust and the balance because the balancing would tilt the sub when the main thrust is off

I would suggest u to put some wing panel and tilt them to a angle, im not sure it would work properly but in theory itll remain the sub perfectly horizontal even when moving
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:45:53 We dont need more ppl to play plane crazy, it is fine what it is. Also it is impossible to turn a ingame build into a studio plugin
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:48:55 No, it sounds extremely dumb and impractical. Tutorials exist you dont even need to sell builds

Even if it works i highly doubt anyone would sell something reasonable and in a fair price, because literally all the public servers are filled with children
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:51:44 No shit, i read your damn old

Its just sounds extremely useless and would turn the entire game into a adopt me like scam place

Also most of the playerbase are literally children who makes block builds, if anything, they just looks at tutorials on youtube

The fuck u even thinking
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:54:17 What hes trying to suggest is literally impossible and impractical in pc and roblox studio
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:56:34 From what i understand, hes trying to suggest that people can make their own builds, send it to roblox studio and make it as a plugin, so others can buy it with bobux and use it again on plane crazy

Like a steam marketplace or something idk anymore

Agree
creations-chat 2021-04-11 10:59:46 No, we dont fucking care about how it could be implemented. The whole fucking idea itself already sounds dumb, impractical and impossible

If anything about using other’s build, just fucking copy them or watch tutors on youtube
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:12:22 That is literally 90% of the pc public chat
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:12:53 You dont even need to put the if sharing gamepass is a thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:13:02 People in public would still do that regardless
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:12:57 What its oversized? The way of how he takes it feels like its straight up from the tutorial and nothing else
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:18:13 Bruh
creations-chat 2021-04-11 23:18:13 Oh cool someone actually sending death threats to people who dislike his build

Guess he couldnt take the pcc style
creations-chat 2021-04-12 03:51:07 When you
creations-chat 2021-04-12 15:57:34 Yo yo yo what the fuck happened here
creations-chat 2021-04-13 12:59:46 Funny looking bridge section
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:15:13 Eh pretty sure all amogus crewmates are basically walking beans with goggles on

Cool mechanics tho, so its not really a low effort
creations-chat 2021-04-14 11:12:05 Amogus isnt funny its just annoying now

No one even says sus in the actual game its just random voting with 0 discussion
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:44:38 Actually uhh

You do actually need work on your painted blocky Dorito thing tho

Imagine trying to reason with pcc lol you wont stand a fucking chance alone
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:47:04 Bruh u arent suppose to post someone else’s build dumbass

Apparently it was u who didnt read rules first
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:49:41 Bruh their names are too similar, this id give an apology 

You do however, need to explain why it looks similar to the tutorial tho
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:53:03 I already did, why do u even bother to scroll at me now
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:59:34 This reminds me that one time where there are 2 groups of dogs seperated by a fence and barking each other until the fence open, then both groups left

I mean its kinda accurate
creations-chat 2021-04-14 17:04:33 It is very cool
creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:29:10 That moment when

That moment when pcc argue about a photoshopped build
creations-chat 2021-04-16 14:22:45 Get lighter head colour, full black isnt really that good, especially when you have the whitest teeth in the entire universe
creations-chat 2021-04-18 04:55:45 Pcc being pcc again
creations-chat 2021-04-18 05:10:12 Holy fuck

Its just blocks wth
creations-chat 2021-04-18 10:57:07 That paintjob looks like what the majority of public server players would apply on their builds
creations-chat 2021-04-19 15:43:26 This one is too relatable for me

creations-chat 2021-04-21 12:02:56 I mean its not really that bad

Still have work to do tho
creations-chat 2021-04-21 12:58:47 Every day we got at least 2 of these arguements

Pcc moment
creations-chat 2021-04-26 11:38:07 Wheres the sus
creations-chat 2021-04-28 10:46:56 Motor cylinder wheels slow?

Just use more motors <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-04-28 10:51:23 Make it bigger then <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Or dont use motor to power wheels at all, just use thrusters and shit
creations-chat 2021-04-28 10:54:16 Default wheel rim pattern looks like sink filters, its actually pretty ugly
creations-chat 2021-04-28 10:56:55 My landship dont have a suspension

It’s technically a massive car <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-04-28 11:01:42 The base is literally flat

Unless you car is like unbalance and flips around i highly doubt it isnt smooth ride

creations-chat 2021-04-28 11:54:47 You gonna respect the guy who have the courage to post the shit into <#384025409945337856> tho

I know, its actually look pretty terrible, reminds me of the public server builds
creations-chat 2021-05-01 04:43:55 Imagine almost putting your bread into the toaster but then some kid with tutor plane crash into the bread and sent it into the shadow realm
creations-chat 2021-05-01 13:52:44 I mean your plane looks really decent, but its not necessary to post reference images

Imo the peeps who downvoted really just have high standards
creations-chat 2021-05-01 13:56:11 I mean to be fair you ask for a tutorial first (which was unacceptable to the pcc discord), they said no, you say shut up whitename

While itll end quickly in other communities, do not forget this is pcc
creations-chat 2021-05-05 00:34:45 He have a gamer minceraft texture pack
creations-chat 2021-05-06 14:21:30 Ngl that mech reminds me of the japanese mechs from Red alert
creations-chat 2021-05-07 06:10:06 His ship is kinda thick and blocky, honestly if he use wedges to smooth it out it would look way better

He’s also not getting downvoted to hell, so why the fuck is he so butthurt about this?
creations-chat 2021-05-09 03:49:39 My mans tell them to stfu

creations-chat 2021-05-09 07:14:21 Yes.
creations-chat 2021-05-09 10:38:38 A bit cruel ngl but ok

<@!739369649971527720> i would suggest replace the cheese grinder control panels with motor controlled wings

<@!767079066997620767> which kid stole your build, im interested

Ok thx guys, imma check on his channel and see if i can possibly shit on him
creations-chat 2021-05-22 14:54:38 Nvm its already shitted multiple times by yall

Feel bad about you bro, having your build copied and posted on youtube as tutorial, then get creation blacklisted
creations-chat 2021-05-22 15:16:34 Neat, bit tall tho

Nose can be a bit longer, but that really depends on what you’re referring to
creations-chat 2021-05-23 09:51:45 ^

That and some decorations on the deck
creations-chat 2021-05-23 14:51:08 Match pretty well

creations-chat 2021-05-25 04:28:52 Kinda good
creations-chat 2021-05-25 05:59:18 But

I asked
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:22:18 Small custom jet, kinda based on the f14 and f15, spend an hour and a half in this so it’s extremely rushed and the quality is shit af

What do u guys think
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:28:33 Same for me, altho the angled stabilizers would hinder the back wings movement, might consider rebuilding the back tho so the angled stable can adapt

Yea it also kinda look like the F-4.
I should actually try to build a F4 using the same front
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:32:48 Well i mean i did say its rushed

Cool feedback anyways not everyone here would explain whats wrong in details
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:40:33 Understandable

Thanks
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:43:43 German churchill as he said
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:59:03 Theres motorlocked tutorial builds

Its just the kids would always fuck it up due to no knowledge of motorlocking

Dont really see any spitfire tutor without motorlock tho so i think this fine
creations-chat 2021-05-26 06:02:08 gamering
creations-chat 2021-05-26 06:05:18 My ass hurts watching this shit
creations-chat 2021-05-26 11:52:33 Some dudes would probably come and say “exposed motorlock”

But other then that id say its pretty decent, nice job op
creations-chat 2021-05-26 15:40:29 Why does the middle controller looks like a radio
creations-chat 2021-05-27 05:48:05 Salt farm

creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:08:38 To be fair every creation that prefers looks>function only claims to be it but never shows how well it functions

If these things came crashing to the ground uncontrollably im laughing my ass off
creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:14:26 Ngl this thing hurts me physically and mentally i am crying and shaking as well as having a literal seizure

The mag collides with the barrel, the trigger is gone, the stock is too short.

I remember i once made a p90 back then, aint detailed enough but the proportions are ok id say
creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:31:33 Shit

He pro
creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:37:20 😔
creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:43:23 He mean the cases (shells)

P90 eject shells from the bottom instead of the side
creations-chat 2021-06-01 13:06:05 Last time i checked the wright flyer doesnt look like a wooden popsicle stick

True its not even the first plane, its the first functional plane i think
creations-chat 2021-06-01 13:09:53 Or just straight up going down a cliff and kills the pilot

Still dont remember the wright flyer look like a popsicle tho, mans get everything wrong there

600 speed really is nothing
creations-chat 2021-06-04 06:50:44 The plane design itself is pretty meh, kinda look like a low quality submarine with wings

At least its better then the Y wing, whose main selling point is “cant fly”
creations-chat 2021-06-04 06:53:01 Referring to this guy
creations-chat 2021-06-04 11:07:14 What that russian guy talking about

And tbh he doesnt know the rules if he really can’t understand english
creations-chat 2021-06-04 12:44:42 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145> why
creations-chat 2021-06-06 10:02:45 He made a 10x10 cube, and carved it into that shape <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-06-07 00:14:40 they use it in the most basic way possible, they are placed at the bottom
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:43:56 new day, new drama

i love this community
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:46:00 ok seriously tho, what missile we are talking about

no damn, whose missiles we're talking about
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:51:33 this is pcc

its pure drama

seriously tho someone explain to me who exploited to make his missiles goes brr
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:53:41 isnt that rule breaking? for inviting ppl here to another server
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:56:08 Ah, ok, i am being dumb

So this man end up not giving ppl how to build epic tracking missiles and harassing ppl everywhere he goes?
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:59:56 Ok i really need to step out of this, i did not understand a single shit going on here

As usual, new day new drama, pcc moment
creations-chat 2021-06-08 14:51:44 Yes

I just find reference pic on google, so its not the exact detail

Nah, mine isnt made for combat, its quite big and fast so it pushes everything not anchored tho
creations-chat 2021-06-09 02:05:13 This is why

you dont let women

take the wheel
creations-chat 2021-06-09 04:41:18 Fix what

Just, that? Really?
I would just ignore it, take a better camera angle without the exposed lock and show that to the homies
creations-chat 2021-06-09 04:43:57 Or if possible, make a custom angle involving more motorlocking

So that it covers that one corner of exposed motor
creations-chat 2021-06-09 05:10:05 Disliked😡😡 !!1!you claimed that its 100% motor locked yet the seat isn’t locked !1!

creations-chat 2021-06-09 11:34:04 It looks really good tho

All he needs is just a railgun and a good paint job and it’ll become the latest top build
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:05:00 I mean pcc standards are extremely high to them your build looks like a cluster fuck of random blocks
creations-chat 2021-06-11 10:53:02 Uh,

Did he just show his id card to a bunch of people online

Makes sense but still, who knows the risk you might get
creations-chat 2021-06-11 11:51:14 Ok before he says “bUt i ModIfY iT” or some shit i have to clarify that modifications of a tutorial build is still not allowed
creations-chat 2021-06-11 12:02:34 Im dying

creations-chat 2021-06-16 03:45:08 Can we see the locked version
creations-chat 2021-06-16 03:49:08 Canopy could be a bit smoother, if possible tilt the front wings down by a bit with powered motorlock. Other then these 2 im fine with it
creations-chat 2021-06-16 10:42:56 Democracy moment
creations-chat 2021-06-16 11:56:45 Man this image reminds me of the good ol time where motorlock doesnt exist yet
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:11:46 *Ok since when does 2 emoji count as emoji spam*

Anyways, copied build, disliked, i fucking hate it
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:17:04 Its the same fucking scale and shape get ######
creations-chat 2021-06-17 01:28:15 Or use a fake rotor

That takes off by using probably 20 propellers
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:38:04 Ok that just looks too weird

The colours tho
creations-chat 2021-06-17 14:34:29 Dont remember the last S being F35 but ok
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:18:46 Well to be fair your shit is way better then 90% of public server builds
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:20:56 “Need detail, add colour”

“Exposed lock <:trollface:775024642104229898>”
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:23:23 Just do the locking inside the plane and use camera to connect it to the part u wanna lock
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:26:12 Hide the lock inside of that me262 engine

Or just paint the exposed lock so it doesnt look obvious on first glance
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:33:20 Holy fuck, calm down, its just a wip in <#384025409945337856>, let him learn his lesson the hard way when the mods warn him
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:35:33 Just let him learn it the hard way, or just ignore him if he start talking trash
creations-chat 2021-06-18 08:39:48 Literally no one died

They have moments when they stand 1 inch to the front they be crushed to death, yet no one actually had died from it
creations-chat 2021-06-18 13:29:19 Should i make Lao gan ma (chilli sauce)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 05:48:45 Maybe not include any flag at all helps with the general score <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-06-22 09:42:35 Damn cool, fronts bit weird tho

creations-chat 2021-06-24 06:46:20 Here we are having a furry thinking hes the centre of the world by having a rocket science V role

👌😎
creations-chat 2021-06-24 06:48:22 ^

You also posted a image, how are we suppose to judge how well it works thru a picture
creations-chat 2021-06-24 06:51:22 Here in creation we judge how good your creation is thru the looks, not the function.

Besides, making it work is easy, but make it look good is extremely difficult
I really just bet all it does is hover around the base and use its flamethrower
creations-chat 2021-06-24 06:54:50 Very based
creations-chat 2021-06-24 07:29:43 Agreed, the rocket launchers looks lazily placed, needs revamp

As for the wheels motorlocked 2x2 cylinders would be more suitable
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:09:19 To be fair, kidnap van had gone from funny to overused to annoying
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:12:42 Thats still just annoying

Its not like hes actually ruining your game,
But your unfunny van did ruined his game
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:17:04 Ok, firstly the homophobe argument is invalid, i feel like no one cares if ones homophobe, there is zero evidence anyways you just claimed to said so. Secondly, just black list them, nabbing people off with seats seems more annoying then big builds
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:19:22 Because we like to do a little trolling <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Ok whatever, ill continue on my day

creations-chat 2021-07-21 08:08:42 I mean anything is way better then whatever the fuck we have to go against in pvp public
-default tutorial plane with pvp weapons on them
-shredder
-shredder shaped like my #####
-box on wheels
-actually good build but functionally look like they high on crac

How tf does the starter plane have 550 speed is he high
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:32:33 I mean no matter how good your build is theres always some guy who downvoted because “not detailed enough”
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:36:09 Good enough, would make the landing gear a different color tho
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:39:48 Plane crazy pvp isnt about skill anymore it doesnt matter when someone gets a shredder bug into your ass while at mach 4

Literally anything but plane combat is unfun ngl
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:44:38 Plane combat is still alright since you could run away at high velocity (what they gonna do? Chase you over with their 600 speed garbage? I outrun a shredder bug with an ac130 literally). But anything other then plane combat, like ground or water, you’re getting fucked multiple times in a row

I love that one creation where a guy and his homies shoot each other with a spaceship, now thats feels more like pvp instead of a tut plane with 10 guns flying towards you
creations-chat 2021-07-31 15:24:57 God damn it i mean ground/water warfare since when did you see a tank go like 800 speed without it flying

Still its kinda unfun trying to beat a ball and a white lightsaber
creations-chat 2021-07-31 15:33:54 It just feels unsatisfying to fight against a build that used like 2 mins to construct, and that’s exactly what public pvp looks like everyday to me

You can easily counter them yeah but thats no fun, and if you let them come and get you then you’re like screwed 1 second in
creations-chat 2021-08-01 08:54:39 I absolutely cannot build a proper ship, this is pretty epic
creations-chat 2021-08-01 08:58:41 No fucking shit
creations-chat 2021-08-01 09:06:23 Floats too tall, have the red part underwater or just remove it, the chimney literally blocked the bridge (how tf do u even see in that), cannons can be bigger and  putting guns aren’t necessary, make the thing more greyish. The destroyer on the top of the chat is a good reference

creations-chat 2021-08-04 09:27:46 Bruh just rejoin or walk to respective plots

Do we seriously need 8 people for this shit
creations-chat 2021-08-04 09:29:48 <:nooo:787097964946259978> 

Ok seriously tho walking up to each other seems more simple then asking 9 randoms to join
creations-chat 2021-08-04 09:36:36 I would suggest to spawn the plant and physically move it next to his plot, all while keeping any motorlock not locked (change them back to powered), so he have a easier time copying

Asking 9 people to join is really the last resort since anyone of them can fuck up everything and view this as a free private server to do their shit

The build for copying will be spawned and moved next to the copier’s plot, any motorlock will be set to powered to stop the locking
creations-chat 2021-08-04 10:26:29 Pretty sure thats from the man from high castle
creations-chat 2021-08-04 11:42:58 My guy made a public vehicle and call it a german tank
creations-chat 2021-08-04 11:54:27 Very detailed not bad

Whats with that red square tho
creations-chat 2021-08-04 11:57:25 Id say leaving a space there would do better but besides that one small detail the entire build isnt bad, in fact very well done and detailed
creations-chat 2021-08-04 15:54:54 Are you trying to remake Chernobyl scene on plane crazy or use it for rp? For the former i would suggest make a tall car that look like the mi 8 once the camera on it is activated, so you have better control over the thing
creations-chat 2021-08-04 15:57:08 Basically a tall car for filming, at the very top of the car the same mi 8 would be placed

So all the controls you have to do is the car & not the heli

Np good luck
creations-chat 2021-08-05 05:00:44 Id say its also pretty alright, but why the guy’s ass facing the front tho really look at how he sit
creations-chat 2021-08-05 14:03:43 Necessary unnecessary
creations-chat 2021-08-08 18:26:13 The system had found you to be the real shit among all those harassments to people who have exposed locks in their build

I copy blacklisted him
He end up making it into a car
Absolutely funny
creations-chat 2021-08-10 08:18:11 I dont really get why people would try to copy other peoples build. They could just left the game/copy blacklist/spawn another build and cause the copier to waste their own time since they now cant copy

Also apparently a lot of them cant comprehend with angle lock so whenever i put a build with angle lock they just use wedge to replace that area
creations-chat 2021-08-10 08:25:46 This is what brain smol does to a mf

Seriously dont copy guys its just a waste of your own time

Then half a second later they are best buddies what the fuck is the logic in public server
creations-chat 2021-08-10 08:41:16 These mf really think reporting do shit with their boo hoo bulshit

Anyways, someone called my m2 bradley a tank
creations-chat 2021-08-10 08:56:23 Yea the bradley is a infantry fighting vehicle, but i think i know why they call it a tank since the visual difference is rather close
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:00:04 I mean the majority of public servers are just kids who apparently have the same amount of IQ as their age

Just fly faster lol, they’ll cry and call you a coward for not fighting them

His terrible design in the spiny thing cause him to fall into the void along with the machine, then he start complaining to me. Absolutely funny

creations-chat 2021-08-13 13:28:39 final product

Is there anything else before i put it in creations?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 13:37:53 too late
Alright imma actually change the length to apropriate level
creations-chat 2021-08-13 13:41:37 alright gonna put this in creations now
creations-chat 2021-08-13 13:50:30 I am at max sprinkler limit
creations-chat 2021-08-13 14:00:55 I guess they really dont like abrams <:empty:794431705070174238> 

Whatever, its a good learning experience regardless
creations-chat 2021-08-13 15:31:06 Extending the length is completely possible, i once think about doing so but apparently i decided to make the wheel count accurate

And the turret is just skill issue <:empty:794431705070174238>

Thank, h
creations-chat 2021-08-13 15:51:37 God damn it they do look alike

Tall turret, the backer part of the turret becomes verticle
Only thing my tank lacks is a radar thing sticking near back

Thanks for your feedback anyways
creations-chat 2021-08-14 07:41:45 To be fair pvp is never centred to planes/tanks/boats but instead shredder #### and #####

creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:15:01 As a guy who made builds that use more motors then proper blocks i approve
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:17:04 Bro this ain’t politics you dont need to say you’re anti motorlock

Also i dont think a gun at the side helps a lot with accuracy in pvp
creations-chat 2021-08-20 07:45:59 cool
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:02:25 Trippin propellers

What plane is that suppose to be btw
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:06:17 Ok i am no plane engineer but  realistically i think if the propellers are slightly leaned to the plane its probably gonna tear itself apart
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:08:22 ok but what is your plane base on is it custom or what
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:11:46 k

creations-chat 2021-08-22 06:19:25 Also harsh criticism would actually make some people want to improve

Just pure compliments would make everyone’s ego as high as mount Everest
creations-chat 2021-08-22 06:37:47 You know if you split one fries into 2 and eat them you technically ate 2 fries

creations-chat 2021-08-25 11:58:06 How bout a easier way

step 1. Dont expose your locks
creations-chat 2021-08-28 04:29:49 *bruhhh*
creations-chat 2021-08-28 05:08:00 Could be less transparent, the colour is good tho

Is that a su57? Pretty good i must say
creations-chat 2021-08-28 05:36:25 Much better
creations-chat 2021-08-28 05:38:27 Good
Now put 4 more similar engines side by side

Sadge
creations-chat 2021-08-28 10:48:22 I mean its not bad compare to most shit in public server but still why calling others build shit when you build like that
creations-chat 2021-08-28 10:54:45 Still better, although its far from good in our standards

Besides i think all that designer V comes from pixel arts, which is very easy to make if you have a colour picking software
creations-chat 2021-08-28 10:57:24 Ikr
creations-chat 2021-08-28 14:28:11 *what the fuck is the difference i am dumb*

creations-chat 2021-09-01 04:57:58 I think it pog, i like the blue used in the ship
creations-chat 2021-09-01 11:45:59 I dont know, im going to die from saying motorl*** anyways
creations-chat 2021-09-02 03:51:22 Wait theres weight in different materials?

All i know is ice reduce some weight and lag while glass being transparent
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:00:16 I think he meant best brick but still i can produce higher quality bricks then this shit
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:02:58 Also train wheels as landing gear

Truly the best fucking plane <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:29:32 Stop using pvp as a excuse

Need rotating? Make the thing be able to turn 360 smoothly
Cant aim? Get good or improve the mechanism 
Aint suppose to move? Then dont, be stationary
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:31:53 I am just giving out criticism, theres a reason why people downvote your builds.
You cant expect people to suddenly like your builds just because its for pvp

creations-chat 2021-09-05 13:41:38 This one?
Im kinda surprised how he havent deleted it yet
creations-chat 2021-09-05 13:46:27 All the tuts and he decided to use the oldest one where you can still see block outlines
creations-chat 2021-09-05 13:50:29 People like you already exist, we dont need the same type of people over and over again

Also why the hell did you say this when we are accusing someone of tut build
creations-chat 2021-09-05 13:53:44 You mean theres no point of copying a tut over and over again?

I am genuinely confused on your choice of words
creations-chat 2021-09-05 13:57:17 Ah i see, alright

Sorry for kinda being a a hole for a moment
creations-chat 2021-09-05 14:19:07 It looks fucking fire tho
creations-chat 2021-09-05 14:41:12 Also the turret feels blocky

||To be fair i have no right to say that due to my experience with tank turret<:trollface:775024642104229898> ||

creations-chat 2021-09-06 02:55:20 you know i should also try to build myself a gun in pcc, the last time i do that is kinda long time ago and to be fair it looks like something from a crappy boblox gaem
creations-chat 2021-09-06 02:58:26 its... not bad
Personally i would make the mag more brownish or a similar tone as the barrel and scope

creations-chat 2021-09-08 11:20:02 Idk? Signs maybe? The ladders magbe? Perhaps that fucking **motorlock** on the front
creations-chat 2021-09-08 11:22:21 Guess im wrong about the feature part

But then it wont be just a coincidence that both builds look the same

Just because you think of the painting doesnt mean its yours
If that logic actually applies i could just grab a HoF build, recolor it, and claim it as mine
creations-chat 2021-09-13 00:07:20 ok but its pretty stupid that you just post a build that isnt even yours seriously the guy just suggest the paint and the paint is basic as fuck

He also provoked a gang war in the process

creations-chat 2021-09-19 11:33:16 And then the last one spits out a block
creations-chat 2021-09-19 11:38:56 Fr tho with that you can basically do a lot with it

It can be a tank carrier, a inland aircraft carrier, a inland cargo carrier, and what everyone above suggests

The versatility is real on this one
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 13:13:23 ZSU 23 4 hull
Ignore the dream building pls
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 13:15:12 Its intentional

My design is that theres a vent in that area, couldnt figure it out how to do so (tried ballistic tank/ ladder, dont look well) so i shove in a sign that looks fair enough as a placeholder
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 13:15:18 yea, im fucking lazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 13:15:25 the back
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 13:16:40 probably a bot

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:37 0 gun = morer armor <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:06:48 I can just imagine a tank with the tank barrel replaced with a absurd amount of armour plate
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:07:23 And then it just get its track blew off by a mine
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:08:11 Tank with no armour, but the hatch will open revealing a guy with a rocket launcher
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:11:38 A rocket launcher acting as a tank armor? 
Sounds cool, i sure hope no one will shoot at the launcher causing it and the entire tank to explode due to chain affects

plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:12:24 Also build a boat is kinda grindy
Sure the tools are extremely good for building detailed builds

But before that you’re stuck with glitch builds or blocky builds that have the sole purpose of getting money
creations-chat 2021-09-20 05:16:12 I know, i just find it awkwardly similar

creations-chat 2021-09-21 14:03:38 Even if you actually made a tornado i dont think a lot of people here would like it

But you could always try, i guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:45:55 Perfect
Probably one of the most detailed-ass build ive made
Now all i had to do is to apply color
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:19:09 Some final adjustments related to the turret top

Hopefully i am able to do the paintjob properly
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:19:36 it is a fat ass turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:20:20 the width is directly the  same width as the hull like the actual thing wdym
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:22:23 
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:22:33 if anything the turret is too tall
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:22:37 not wide
creations-chat 2021-09-24 14:27:01 Add more boost to make submarine turn

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:09:45 Is this green alright for my shilka? The green make it look like its from something like red alert tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:10:13 i will have more shades of green for other parts this is just the general body color
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:15:56 Soo, you think i should take the RA approach instead?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:17:44 Im thinking more lean to the afghan soviet war color
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:17:57 Pog
creations-chat 2021-09-24 15:20:18 Yo that guy do be doing some intense motor locking tho
creations-chat 2021-09-24 15:24:27 <:nooo:787097964946259978> it just look like locking when the guy spawns it

But ngl that do be some impressive scripting tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:25:51 Your camera could be fucked at some angle leading your seat to be in brazil
creations-chat 2021-09-24 15:26:55 Rather then using the most generic boring flying kiddie script these dudes took the extra time to script the parts together and animate them

I give props to that
creations-chat 2021-09-24 15:29:51 Ok fuck anyways they actually took some effort for scripting parts or idk

Im stupid i guess
creations-chat 2021-09-24 15:41:16 minceraft

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:41:26 cant really get any larger <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:41:41 its either smol or comically oversized
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:42:24 not much difference
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:42:38 plus it would just make the barrel part more complicated
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:42:45 making the elevation looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:45:30 To be honest i know i can make it thicker with 2 extra trails but it'll just make the entire lock more complicated making the elevation this weird
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:46:56 i get it
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 03:47:04 oh my lord

<@!580430817550139442> behind the canopy where the body is
creations-chat 2021-09-26 03:57:33 the paint makes it look burnt, perhaps make the black lighter and greener
Shape wise its good tho

<@!699460165707235338> i do notice some brownish tone, but thats still to dark, making it look like black if ones not looking closely
creations-chat 2021-09-26 04:00:08 middle or right
creations-chat 2021-09-26 04:03:40 definitely

Btw didnt you have another one with a cylinder canopy?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 14:35:05 You are very unfunny
Also most of the time kamikaze pilots dont get fuel for 1 way trip, the japs at that time are short of valuable men, they wont casually waste people just because their plane have technical issues that dont allow them to hit targets
creations-chat 2021-09-27 14:37:38 plane crazyn’t

creations-chat 2021-10-07 04:47:34 Mans desperate in trying to get a positive upvote/ downvote ratio
creations-chat 2021-10-07 04:51:37 Why
Theres like 100 builds to screenshot from and he just choose the shit ones
creations-chat 2021-10-07 04:54:15 All the builds to choose to steal and he steals the shittest one out of all
creations-chat 2021-10-07 11:21:37 Depends, most likely yes
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:55:15 It appears that sir, i understand your concern over my build quality, but the ratio i receive in my creation is insanely bad, therefore i wish my regards to your mother and would proceed to not elaborate further
creations-chat 2021-10-08 11:14:28 Very cool
creations-chat 2021-10-08 12:15:41 Actually very cool
creations-chat 2021-10-09 09:10:26 Nice

The prop kinda need work tjo
creations-chat 2021-10-09 11:38:29 Looks very good generally

Would be cooler if the + is directly on top of the 104
creations-chat 2021-10-09 11:47:33 Use 1x1 signs and make the text big so the second + will get out of the text box

Or just have a bunch of space between the two + so that the second one will leave the box
creations-chat 2021-10-10 03:11:59 I can really tell man tried to make a b52 due to the similar shape of it but fail miserably 

Also who cares how many bombs you have you didnt even show them

<@723940197456281640> agree
creations-chat 2021-10-10 03:14:59 Good looking builds can be also used for pvp so using pvp purpose on a shit build is kind of a excuse
creations-chat 2021-10-10 04:26:14 So uhh
How well can it turn
creations-chat 2021-10-10 04:29:17 So would u orbit the entire platform when u turn it

A handful of modern games are cool but the rest are just unoriginal and repetitive
creations-chat 2021-11-01 12:00:53 The front page be like
**drop me, jailbroke, anime bulshit simulator 526, eat shit, tower defense simulator, yeet city**

Fr tho its always these games they should call the genre “best games” instead of “discover”

Fair enough

Its not anything significant statically unless your build is really fucking shit
creations-chat 2021-11-17 11:15:45 I mean if u want to you can

plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:37:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:38:29 Idk why but most of the builds in hof takes up half of the entire plot even when its spawned
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:38:38 Small builds have practically no chance
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:38:55 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:38:57 Still tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:40:02 Some of the small builds in creations had higher score then some in hof tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:40:16 But i guess at the end its based on the mod decision
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 12:40:46 Isnt there a score requirement before requesting for hof

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 14:15:49 Then post proof you get (certain amount of score)
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 14:16:06 But first you need a build in #creation that have high enough score for that requirement

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 07:59:50 But we can use heli rotors for the propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:00:17 Run away
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:00:49 Speed is key if your thing needs ramming
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:03:44 Im thinking about just make a long spear
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:04:04 And poke the guy in his vulnerable spot
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:06:02 Stab them on the top
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:06:12 Actually i feel like scissors might do
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:06:44 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:07:31 Im thinking about just making a roomba in knight armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:07:40 If you cant beat em in a fight you can beat em in style
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:08:18 
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:08:42 Heli blades are for proplusion
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:08:55 Not for flying
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:09:06 Propellers as in default propellors
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:10:18 Imagine if it shits out multiple smaller drones lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:10:48 Magnets arent allowed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:10:54 So do suspensions and springs
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:11:05 So you pretty much can only catapult it with motors
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:00 Can we fight on water
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:32 Water wheels yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:49 Shouldnt we just make uhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:52 A bulldozer
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:56 And push people off
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:14:38 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:24:51 no its Among sus octopus activity tycoon simulator 2 [pets!]
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:25:19 They could just turn off particles tbh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:25:26 It would be useless
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:25:43 They fucking brought the arsenal bird
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:26:53 Maus real

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:42:28 They cant do shit
creations-chat 2021-12-07 08:43:49 Helikopta helikopta
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:48:12 Pretty sure only build mode cannot go over length limit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:48:20 If you fold or lock and it goes over its alright
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:49:07 Drones come out
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:49:11 Everyone shits their pants
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:50:55 Idk if the locking process would go over build limit but ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:03:07 Man imagine instead of cutters we are allowed using explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:03:27 And the winner is the one who has the most intact build
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:06:54 ‘Who has a intact build’ still applies to 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:14:08 Helikopta Helikopta

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 10:22:37 should i go with a chainsaw or a spear
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 10:28:49 ya
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 10:29:08 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 10:30:24 my idea of the battlebot is a chainsaw/ spear with 4 shields around the thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 10:30:40 2 at the front could become 1 giant 1shield and charge at the opponent
creations-chat 2021-12-07 12:23:28 try yellow <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-08 01:29:44 the colour contrast is too big

plane-crazy 2021-12-08 11:03:42 Fake af
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 01:13:52 i think it would be better to make it in a way so that using the weapon affects your build performances
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 01:14:00 more weapons less speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 01:14:18 using the weapons will sacrifice mobility
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:24:39 yea you are not taking a vid of it taking off just take a shot of motor rotors and switch back to the engine ones
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 02:00:06 by affecting mobility, i mean something like recoil or decrease general maneuverability when using it
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 02:13:07 does zebra have black body and white strip, or does it have white body and black strip?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:57:39 idk man the build looks large enough to hide the locks effectively
creations-chat 2021-12-09 03:01:30 the motorlocks can fit into the plane due to its size but its still exposed
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 03:04:49 Michael P

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 03:42:47 they're just small scale and can't really have any proper interior
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 03:46:34 he is literally right

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 04:53:43 or just make it slower 800-900 wasnt necessary
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 04:53:56 public pvp wise
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 04:55:12 does it not shake
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 04:55:27 yea than it kinda works

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:08:00 Them jets go at a minimum of 1000 speed and can turn faster then me making decisions and regret
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:08:29 And then theres the guy who slap 10 guns at a default tut plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:29:37 Unless the plane was really fucking small
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:29:47 And then the rockets on your jet become woman
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:30:05 And basically ignored the small plane even when you shoot them at point blank

creations-chat 2021-12-11 13:06:37 Wow he
creations-chat 2021-12-11 13:10:40 Honestly, there is no point of defending your build since it mostly likely wont convince others to undownvote it

Once the bad ratings start rolling in, just accept defeat and learn how to improve

Us “ayo you need to fix x and y and z”

Whitenames “fuck you i cant do that”

Us “chill out bro”

Whitenames “i fucking hate you your community sucks you’re all piece of shit”

creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:38:48 Generally, the thing barely looks like a f35
-have a giant gun like an a10
-fat as fuck
-2 seater
-have missiles stuck out
creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:43:53 -the thing is made to be stealthy, a giant gun and missiles would literally fuck up the stealthiness and would get exposed by radar
-its also fat in width, yours just fat in height
-yea f35 is a 1 seater 🗿

If anything, it should be a custom jet instead

plane-crazy 2021-12-20 15:27:25 I thought its called spitfire because if u shot it down it does multiple barrel rolles and burst in flames when it crashes
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 15:31:44 So the only thing that can go super sonic are super sonic engines

plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:56:30 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:56:38 It would fuck up the build even more honestly
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:58:08 If that the recover distance when spawned then yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 09:58:18 But if its distance is build mode then no

-cheese grater
-legit similar colour
-the wing fold is exactly the same
-multiple feature around the plane that replicates vulpen’s tut
-the bombs are also in a chess pattern
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:45:17 Jesus christ why does b17 tut “modifications” looks way worse then the original <:m_:778994206948589638> 

Also the motorlock bombs dont hide the fact that you literally inherited several features from the tut
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 04:45:59 Uh

creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:51:08 Not upvotes but score, which is basically upvotes-downvotes, u need 150 score i think

That and mod approval which is harder
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:54:09 Nah first u need 150 score at minimum, then summit it to a mod, if the mod approve it it goes to hof, if the mod ignores you then its basically a “go fuck yourself” said by the mod 

Mod approval situations mostly ends with the later
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 04:55:00 Vulpen’s b17 tut but way worse
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 04:55:37 “Yea they mistake it for a tut”

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:25:24 Very cheap indeed!
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:25:33 Aerodynamic insane
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:26:20 But since our builds get transferred to pc2 would they work there
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:26:26 Since theres a alternative
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:26:50 You probably use it incorrectly
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:27:00 Like making a huge fucking tower but slapped a few engines only
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:27:25 Hmm hopefully
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:27:36 Also hope that the alternative is togglable
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:27:51 So that we can just to the angle locking without external blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:27:55 Just the tower itself
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:28:43 Like aircraft carrier big?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:28:55 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:29:29 Honestly satisfied with that size if its actually
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:29:41 But if the plots are bigger people can make bigger lag machines
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:29:46 They need to do something about it
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:30:06 No need to be extremely cramped tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:30:44 A 100^(3) size plot is enough to make a 4 fold build into a 2 fold
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:31:36 what.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:31:44 You mean lock motor

plane-crazy 2022-01-08 10:59:31 9 guns lo
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:00:03 Naval war nowaday is just a big boat and multiple self die bomb boats
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:00:29 Guns are very effective yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:00:47 But i am a bomb user, typically self made torpedo
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:01:05 Because its so fucking big
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:01:18 Also if u just shoot the fold motor the entire thing commits epic fail
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:02:09 I am also today years old when i realise guns cannot shoot thru water
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:02:15 When u are on the surface
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:02:32 I tried attacking a “sub” with guns
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:02:35 Doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:03:05 I look down to see the bullet tracers
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:03:14 No yellow lines visible
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:03:24 Therefore im pretty sure the bullets dont work
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:03:43 Good target practice tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:04:10 Unfortunately once beaten these guys would unleash the most generic fucking shredder
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:02 I have this one guy with a shitty fold boat
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:10 I killed it with a tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:17 He unleash the shredder
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:49 Dont die
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:53 Real
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:05:59 Youll fuel the ego of those kids
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:06:25 Then dont spawn lo
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:06:53 Or spawn it in the airport
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:07:08 So even if they spot u lacking u still have some time to angle your build
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:07:55 Workable
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:08:07 Imagine if your motorlock tower cant fly unless locked lo
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:09:30 Most shredders are pretty shit
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:09:35 Did they blacklisted u tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:12:38 Give it a better platform duh
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:13:03 Oh

Shredder users who blacklisted you is the nightmare for tank users
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:13:19 One fly thru u and there u goes
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:14:06 tbh the only good shredder builds are not building shredders
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:14:31 When i play pvp i want to have an actual campaign against other players with similar good builds
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:14:37 Not just some kid flying with his balls

events-chat 2022-01-09 13:59:41 ok im pretty done here
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:00:28 honestly with limited motorlocking (because pvp) thats all i could do
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:18:48 Because they want your thing to actually float by itself
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:30:37 No rockets
I fucking hate rockets their tracking is extremely woman
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:32:13 eh
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:32:53 still dont wanna do rockets tbh
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:36:29 test it on a public pvp
the torpedos work so well
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:48:14 
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:49:03 oh fuck i forgot the propeller behind the motorlock

anyways the propeller and the disconnector uses the same keybind, while the tnt detonation is another keybind

The half ball is pure decorational
events-chat 2022-01-09 14:52:17 They are deadly
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:01:25 Np

Just bear in mind that this design moves kinda slow (my boat can move faster then it 💀) so u might have to do some extra modifications
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:01:58 Guns at long range can easily kill that thing
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:02:38 Plus it have a tall profile so if it tries to turn violently it flips

Damn mine only moves around 95
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:03:22 Massive target, easy kill
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:04:16 Ok good luck slapping like 3000 water props and watch it die within seconds because the fold motor got destroyed
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:05:14 400 br <:empty:794431705070174238> 

Literally average plane speed
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:06:00 Ah yes the **lowest** profile possible

Well we would probably just shoot your character so the entire thing die
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:06:46 Dont need a turn if your thing moves so fast it transverse back and forth of the water in like 2 secodns
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:07:27 I use water prop

Because with the amount of wings it have it probably can fly
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:08:12 Hmm idk you do have a point
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:09:22 Well when they see the seat is empty they probably would try shooting somewhere else but there
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:13:02 Isnt a anti ship missile a flying creation?
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:13:56 Damn i guess ill build a aircraft carrier with small planes and watch the group harass the opponents while the carrier sit in the corner lacking
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:14:41 Ill just turn the carrier on the ground spot then
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:15:30 No thats fucking lazy altho effective
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:20:26 Hmm yes tank boat
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:27:57 No because they get obliterated easily
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:28:15 **wider**
events-chat 2022-01-09 15:31:21 Hmm
Generally i would say make it wide
And for the turning part just slap propellers left and right for turning

No motor 2 is needed

events-chat 2022-01-09 15:34:34 Water pvp is kinda easy on its own

events-chat 2022-01-10 08:01:35 “main pilot seat must still be on the boat”

Step 1: put pilot seat on plane

Step 4: defend your boat with the plane while harassing the opponents

creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:37:36 Hi did you put your f15 into a hydraulic press
creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:43:21 Your f15 doesnt really resemble a actual f15, i get you’re trying to make a japanese camo f15, but the blue is too dark you might as well just use black

The canopy is too low, thats why it look like it had been hard pressed

A lot of random blocks looks very unnecessary, they might be useful aerodynamic wise, but if you’re trying to take a good photo, might as well just remove them

plane-crazy 2022-02-05 11:30:37 And crash
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 11:31:30 Nah bro they probably would just use ‘AI computer’ if they actually want the thing to fly

events-chat 2022-02-08 13:04:29 I fucking killed a 2 fold battleship with 2 torpedos

Each have 1 bombs
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:04:56 Hits the side and the entire thing flips
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:05:41 Unless the carrier is anchored, i dont think they are too hard to sink given the plane crazy physics
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:09:08 To be fair, no boats in pc actually sinks unless u give them ballistic tanks
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:09:28 The parts just floats/ disappears when they got blew up too much
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:10:18 I think the job of the bomber is too immobilise the carrier with the bombs
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:10:43 Either bombing the main seat or the fold

So itll be easier for the other planes to finish it off
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:12:00 The yousuf is really weak tho

Its sluggish, have 4 bombs that look like they cant be dropped seperately, have a single turret in such a big plane
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:13:08 I think you’re not allowed to respawn because its technically downed/ on the ground
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:15:22 That but land on the carrier deck
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:15:44 Im not sure if the carrier is wide enough to land the bomber tho
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:16:15 Actually could we just kamikaze the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:16:38 Its sluggish and near defenceless killing yourself might do more damage
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:17:21 Wish pc actually have a refilling bomb like rockets
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:21:48 You are allowed modifications, i think as long as your plane resembles one of the aircraft and have the armaments/ engines correct then you’re fine
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:22:20 And you cant even use motorlock might as well just follow the thing step by step instead of making something new
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 13:46:09 **meet the sniper**

events-chat 2022-02-08 14:02:44 lets do it then <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:03:28 it is very unlikely a whole squad of yousuf are selected and in the same team

but its possible
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:04:23 you can make all 4 planes but u can only use 1 during the event
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:06:58 defensive bomber how
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:08:32 well it is chonky and intimidating so i think its used more of a distraction
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:08:52 pcc players see easy kill and immediately go for them
often forgot to defend/ attack the real target
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:10:18 bruh the weapons on tin can actually regenerate its gonna do more ten 2-3x damage given the right condition
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:11:00 and it have a **singular** turret to defend itself
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:11:32 a single fucking turret on a specific spot of a chonky ass plane
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:11:54 make a gunship <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:13:37 it even have a guided rocket for assist when attacking
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:13:54 its definitely the meta
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:15:24 are the control surfaces mouse guided or key guided
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:16:24 the bomber definitely needs help

its too sluggish and defenceless that even the default tut plane with 1 gun can overwhelm it
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:21:55 Kamikaze yes

The distraction only works if the enemy is dumb enough
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:24:21 the goal is to destroy the carrier tho

if i were one of the guys i would just rush near the carrier and do serious blows, what can the drones on the carrier even do anyways
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:25:28 stuka but anti ship lo
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:42:41 i dont think the mods will make the carrier have drones
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:42:59 anyways did some analysis on the 4 planes provided
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:45:06 only the bomber can
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:45:25 but y use the tnt when they cannot be rearmed once drop/ detonated
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:46:44 to prevent people from slapping tnt all over their plane and just kamikaze the carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:47:48 or maybe use rockets that are unguided and aim downwards to mimic bombs
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:48:23 thats what we fucking did, we limited every tnt placement per plane to 0 other then the bomber, which is 4
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:49:07 aerodynamic insane
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:58:48 The guy suggested why not allow us to use tnt as normal blocks 💀
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:59:10 B52 attacking a carrier <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:00:22 The bomber might work irl but since this is plane crazy rockets guns and firework are infinite
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:00:39 So they automatically do shit more damage then the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:01:06 It doesnt even have motorlock how do u fail<:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:01:24 It might work on a higher altitudes
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:01:49 But the bombs in pc are so shit
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:02:25 The fuck you mean “no <:trollface:775024642104229898>”
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:03:08 It is suppose to be a interceptor so its more like a defender
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:01 It can help kill the defending planes tho allowing your teammates to go straight to the carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:55 Actually
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:05:20 1 random explosion would tear planes these sizes apart (besides the bomber) so i dont think it really matters
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:05:46 But since the bi plane have a guided rocket, its more likely to hit
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:10 Yes
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:27 And they recharge infinity
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:07:13 Give it 16 layers of sign armour <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:08:27 Fuck it imma clutch with the bomber by dropping bombs on a moving plane
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:10:25 I dont think u can kil anyone by dropping it on the carrier anyways

Better then 1 death/0 kill
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:11:56 Could they just uhh

Record the build footage like youtube tutorials
creations-chat 2022-02-08 15:56:42 Wonder whats the most violent day in <#504436696021204992>

events-chat 2022-02-09 03:09:32 well i did it but uh one small issue tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:09:50 6 engines, goes around 200 spd instead of 130-150
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:18:38 no
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:22:31 are your planes mouse controlled or key controlled
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:24:35 right ok
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:26:09 no
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:26:29 fuck it, b52
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:27:47 nothing on the rules said that u cant add fake engines lmao <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:31:51 i got this no worries
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:35:19 see
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:35:35 told u im a expert at cutting corners
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:36:32 actually might as well just remove the b52 engines it took too much block counts i need some for details

<@!715148402022678608> just saw that and already equip it
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:40:45 agree, go back to the airport and refuel would be a total waste of time
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:41:06 im planning on just using the mouse, it seems more controllable for bombing
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:41:27 rockets do sustainable damage tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:42:47 high altitude bombing
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:44:13 guys can we just use the "gun" and not the "turret" for the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:46:51 can i do this <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:48:59 screw it im abandoning the whole gun turret thing im sticking with the rockets
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:49:48 its not like it can defend itself with a single gun on a specific spot anyways
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:50:25 yea

thats why im staying with just rocket
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:55:06 the big one? 1x4
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:57:06 wait can we use smoke pipes
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:57:26 i know the majority of dudes turned the particle effect off but itll still be a nice addition
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:02:46 
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:23:38 ok, im good now
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:30:10 Pretty sure its illegal and should be disqualified
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:30:40 -motor 2 turret
-1 propeller despite basing on the doof
-the rocket
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:31:44 The hell is that design anyways looks like a van with propeller and wings
events-chat 2022-02-09 07:08:14 I run a test on public server and im safe to say the bomber is the toughest shit out of all 4
events-chat 2022-02-09 07:08:36 I think its difficult to not lose the bomber if the pilot knows what hes doing
events-chat 2022-02-09 07:25:12 like thats gonna happen everyone's gonna do the objective their own way the moment it begins
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:28:39 Moment
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:40:34 Imagine a event match where one side just blew themselves up without hitting anything leaving the carrier to defend itself lol
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:44:00 No i mean the kamikazes just detonate the bomb too early they hit literally nothing
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:46:44 Wait really couldnt u just do that from a far with non guided missiles
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:47:01 So do mine, basically mods can’t calculate speed
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:47:33 Just leave it be lmao i actually prefer it to be this way

We fulfill the requirements by having 6 engines and 4 rockets/tnt anyways
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:48:37 Why

No.
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:48:57 That thing is a weapon of mass destruction to the enemy’s emotions

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:52:28 Oh ok
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:52:49 Blew yourself up, if it doesnt hit, your team basically loses a teammate for nothing
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:53:26 If you really wanna trollege just detonate the bombs on the yousuf bomber without dropping them
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:53:57 I dont think you can even guide in this game one hit in the wings and your thing burst down in parts rapidly
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:55:22 I dont think your props die faster then the wing unless the props are installed at the rear of the plane

But fly hard yes
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:56:31 Then u basically flop like a fish

k
events-chat 2022-02-09 23:48:58 bru why aren't we allow to keep the normal size propellers it's already lacking in multiple aspects
events-chat 2022-02-10 00:01:38 Bruh literally everyone’s BG runs at around 200 something speed why can’t we keep that
events-chat 2022-02-10 00:03:31 But its chonky as fuck and will most likely die without the speed element
events-chat 2022-02-10 00:03:56 At least allow us to partially use normal sized propellers so that it goes at a reasonable speed
events-chat 2022-02-10 00:08:59 Right.

Damn, if u put a lot of time and the outcome is still shit, consider using that time in a more efficient way instead of complaining here, which does nothing to change people’s opinions of your build
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:03:29 Guess we will all shit and cry because no matter what there’s always one guy who dislike all of our builds
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:07:24 Real bro the dislikes either come from annoyingly jealous low ranks who does not even make a good build or actual experts who builds hyper realistic shit on a daily basis
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:10:52 They are indeed supportive, they just finds your build lacking in multiple aspects so they downvoted it and give u honest feedbacks

When i look back in my creations history about who downvoted my build its always these 2 types of people, not really complaining but yea
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:13:07 Good for you then i believe

creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:04:23 you can put 100k blocks in a plot if every block is 1x1x1

because lets say, 1x7, its 7 blocks in length, but considered as 1 block in the save file

plane-crazy 2022-02-23 10:06:20 That are actually really detailed

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 12:33:15 Hi
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 12:33:33 Then just accept that a 1000+ speed rocket isnt a viable option
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 12:33:47 Honestly for me a moderate speed rocket is enough for pretty much anything
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 12:35:16 Just **be the rocket**

plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:41:46 Both takes around 10 mins to make and its generally low effort as shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:42:12 Just fly fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:42:35 Then the shredder user will be mad that he cant keep up with his 400 spd ball and calls u a coward

plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:45:53 Those shit cannot turn well honestly
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:46:26 No matter how much u put on a plane its going to be less effective then a custom 1
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:47:00 No i mean mouse control with main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:47:05 No other fancy things
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:48:05 What the fuck no
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:48:17 I mean like wing panels with motor 2 as the controls
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:48:38 To control the elevation turning yadada idk aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:48:59 undes who thinks they’re funny
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:49:32 Honestly with the soft-coded pc2 theres no need for pc3 since u can make new updates more easier

plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:51:11 Which funny British car
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:52:47 I suggest making a trapezoid first
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:52:56 Then add in the sharp parts as details
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:15 Also the back is kinda long
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:50 Well then i suggest u either go with it or just remake
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:54:30 Remove the suspensions
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:54:32 Real
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:55:16 They make the car bounce around and make motorlock a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:56:26 But it would make motorlocking hard since u need to make it so the lock does not collide or interfere with the suspension
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:57:33 Eh its my personal opinions anyways
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:58:52 Its not a public build if it havent fell of the edge unintentionally <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:56:22 I swear pvp invis glitch is insanely annoying
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:56:45 Like the guy looks like hes stationary, but in fact he’s constantly moving, invisible and his build is still god damn intact
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:57:17 Still tho the majority of invis comes from glitches
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:57:27 You either have to wait til the guy respawn his build
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:57:32 Or blew him up with explosives
creations-chat 2022-03-13 13:59:03 I’d say work on the wheels, the tracks are too dark and the disk emoji does not fit well with the wheels

The rest is good
creations-chat 2022-03-13 14:05:51 Id say use circle text since they are more customisable in terms of colour and look less messier

Im not sure if roblox accept this one, but i think this will work great

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:53:05 On one side, most of my builds gain basic flight by hover drives
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:53:39 On the other side, i dislike fighting against some players who have a normal ass looking plane but can outrun a irl sr71

plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:21:01 Colours are fine but
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:21:09 The red lines in the cockpit looks weird
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:23:34 About the intakes
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:23:40 I would suggest either make the black lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:23:50 Or have ⬛ instead
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:24:02 35,35,35
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:24:30 Or use text blocks labelled with ⬛
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:24:54 I prefer doing this as there’s some outer lines surrounding the intake
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 12:24:56 Smoother

creations-chat 2022-03-22 04:07:04 “I put 4 hours in it” seems like a terrible counter arguement
creations-chat 2022-03-22 04:30:46 clearly

creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:18:50 I can make a way better image when i was like 5 heck even my underaged dumbass cousin could do better then whatever the fuck this shit is

creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:50:38 its not even expos moto anymore its literally a moto jet

mashing a shit ton of motors to each other does make the build look neat it just barely resembles the jet
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:54:38 i mean whats even the point the majority of the motors shown on the jets looks very unnecessary i can replicate it even without motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 01:55:53 fuckers stole the phantom
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:57:03 motorlock is just a assist tool to make your builds more detailed

i dont give a fat shit if u use all the motors available if it looks shit then its shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-28 01:57:41 ive made 3 phantoms

What does nam’s su look like when spawned
creations-chat 2022-03-30 13:49:34 Ok i see the issue now, they are in fact look extremely similar

The general design and the propeller & rocket placement are almost identical
creations-chat 2022-03-30 13:52:53 Fully agree on that, the wing placements, the rocket placements, heck even the motor on the vertical stabiliser is identical to ones on Nam’s

He definitely modified the tutorial and made it look worse

creations-chat 2022-03-30 16:36:32 So basically a group of kids trying to act all mighty and shit i see

Pretty boring ngl
creations-chat 2022-03-30 16:43:58 Bruh the planes arent even flying in proper formations they just flying on their own in a general direction

Plus his destroyer looks like its burnt or something 

Honestly if this is actually the “full might” of the group then im rather dissatisfied
creations-chat 2022-03-30 16:48:45 This is really just peak disappointment, i wont be surprised if one of them in the picture is actually just a random who unfortunately got his build into the pic
creations-chat 2022-03-30 16:51:33 I never get into roblox rp because its just insanely awkward lmao

plane-crazy 2022-04-10 09:38:55 How do u even ran out of motors
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 09:39:21 Just cut corners i think take out the unnecessary ones
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 09:40:32 I dont think even a detailed 4 fold aircraft carrier can use all the motors but ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 09:41:07 Just remove the unnecessary motorlocks that serves little purpose and repurpose them into something else
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:43:02 probably use the void to take off

If u actually use 35 hours on these then i must say thats a poor use of time
creations-chat 2022-04-12 17:36:44 Yea but unlike u this only takes around 5 minutes and after that I’ll generally forget about your existence

Idk alot about maths but 35 hours is definitely more then 5 minutes

creations-chat 2022-04-14 04:24:57 dude with enough propulsion i can get my whole house to fly in plane crazy under 10 minutes theres no fucking way you spend 5 days alone on this shit
creations-chat 2022-04-14 04:28:43 maybe use ballistic block? plus if your weight is very off on either side of the plane than you're doing something very incorrectly
creations-chat 2022-04-16 11:30:26 Honestly at that point just build the whole plane with motors

Overlocking isnt worth it
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 11:36:09 boy photos lmao

plane-crazy 2022-04-16 11:39:34 Impossible due to the average roblox players are insanely unwilling to cooperate and work together

plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:43:56 Sometimes these kids just sits on your main pilot seat thinking by doing that they have full control of your build in build mode
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:44:06 And then when they realise it doesnt fucking work
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:44:10 They spam the parachute
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:44:37 Its really annoying tbh
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:45:03 Well sometimes if theyll lucky enough your build will fuck itself up and glitch out
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:45:51 I dont play pvp because god its just filled with low effort shit with basic pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:46:03 Its not fun to shoot them down

plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:46:49 You should show his name so we can do a comparison and laugh at him
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:47:26 Most of the times its either shredders, default tut plane with guns or the same vulpen mig 29 tut
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:48:06 Congo

plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:49:50 Very inaccurate
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:50:00 I never build a singular shredder
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:50:15 And motorlock doesnt instantly turn your ok builds into good builds
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:50:20 They are there as a assist tool
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:50:35 If youre a doo doo fard the assist tool would fuck your build up
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:51:51 Normal glass yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:51:55 Legacy doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:52:54 If its not then its your cilent that have issues
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:53:05 Does it have those ugly gaps between blocks? Then its legacy
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:54:02 Probably cilent than
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:54:48 STNEFS
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:55:14 Plane crazy undes are build different
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:56:31 A plate with wheels and a singular turret
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:56:42 Bright neons are optional
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 06:56:57 But usually their “camo” are the default colours and looks hella shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:04:09 Dudes cutting his plane like a sausage
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:04:26 Really terrible idea
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:05:00 No fucking way thats a angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:05:03 Its just a motor
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:05:13 **A** motor
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:05:48 Imagine a break action shotgun that can fly
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:05:51 Yea, that
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:06:46 Yea and he mostly likely crashed and die
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:07:53 Use motorlock to do it
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:08:10 No he mean a cone
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 07:09:11 Round wedge in & out?

creations-chat 2022-04-21 10:58:53 Well it is in fact less harsh because the majority of builds there are a piece of shit making the standards very low
creations-chat 2022-04-21 11:50:26 ~~Its the engine~~

Its the default suspension, change some settings on it or remove it entirely
creations-chat 2022-04-21 11:52:14 No it fucking wont, just replace the suspension with 2 blocks

The suspension will handicap your ass if you’re trying to do something complex with the build


Dampling stiffness idk just mess with it i dont use suspensions
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 11:53:19 Why not just use the control surfaces i mean they do the job as well
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 11:54:16 Ok fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 11:54:35 I never use the vertical stabilisers on my planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 12:04:04 Roblox chat are build different

plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:00:00 warships for flexing
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:00:35 So its not all warships
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:00:44 Strap a gun on a dolphin and call it a submarine
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:01:44 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:03:06 Ok but some boats in plan craz are made only for flexing

plane-crazy 2022-04-23 05:08:45 Sounds like every kid playing landwarfare in plane crazy public pvp
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:04:22 Putin when children on roblos applied the colors blue and yellow on their plane forcing him to withdraw all forces from Ukraine
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:06:00 And the Ukrainian Civilians <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:08:16 Well this whole Russian Ukraine thing wasnt gaining any progress
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:08:39 It was concerning weeks ago but now its not
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:09:16 Lowkey expect them to steamroll the entirety of europe
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:09:37 Because all the propaganda
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:09:49 They dont even know where to go
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:10:15 Their logistics had issues despite their mothercountry being next to the country their invading
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:11:07 When a plane load of vdv troopers fly towards a uncontrolled airspace
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:11:31 Bouta hit the biggest collat in the century
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:12:51 Yea since they arent gaining much progress id say we should temporarily forget about this
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:13:37 Slapping blue and yellow on your build doesnt help shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:14:58 Putin shat his pants seeing all the twerks

creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:08:42 The wings shape arent too much of an issue when the main frame and colours doesnt look ideal
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:10:02 Holy crap among us 😐
creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:13:46 Slightly better than the basic planes the actual basic planes you see looks more like a block then an actual plane

At least u can figure out the shape on this one
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:30:04 Now cover the cheese grater up with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:30:11 That way it looks more smoother
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:31:33 Wing creates way too many drag

trapdoors gets annoying fast when some dumbass walk up to your plane and somehow manage to keep flipping them over
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:32:06 You got a bar of cameras set up already
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:33:13 Put some disconnectors on top of them, adjust if necessary so that the disconnectors and control surface touches together directly once locked
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:34:22 Adjust with a single motorlock block
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:38:12 Do something like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:38:18 And youll get this
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:38:28 Fuck im terrible with words
creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:42:12 “[Music]”

This shits fucking fire
creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:43:55 Idk im not deaf i cant really distinguish whether its trash or masterpiece

The only thing i know is that its fire
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:45:18 The disconnector heads?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:45:59 Can u show build mode
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:46:07 Maybe you connect them with some invis blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:46:18 If they dont stick to anything its probably due to server lag
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:47:57 But its annoying sometimes especially when you have like 20 different locks all across the build
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:48:03 good
creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:49:32 what a nice community.
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:51:18 Cameras are great when u wanna fold small bits but dont wanna waste a lot of space
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:51:29 Helium
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:51:40 You past christmas
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:51:58 In the front
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:52:14 Wdym bad solution i do that with all of my plane builds and they work fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:54:43 Oh right its for the ranking thing
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 15:57:09 Very relatable
creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:57:54 Back then when being a new player is more forgiving
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:01:07 Straight probably
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:01:09 Custom?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:02:02 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:02:10 Straight would be good
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:02:18 You gonna put the engines there right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:02:30 If not then pointy
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:02:52 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:03:30 I know this plane should give futuristic vibes but
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:03:47 What if you put a turret there like the one on a b17
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:04:33 Just a mere suggestion
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:05:43 the j
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:06:25 I have similar issues with my assault aircraft before
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:06:35 The back just looks hella flat and bland
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:08:16 You know what pointy tail should look fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:08:43 As long as it doesnt look like a sharp spike
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:08:48 He mean a 3 engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:08:54 Terrible idea
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:09:46 Looks fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:10:08 Doesnt have a sharp pointy wedge thing like how i expected it
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:10:21 Thatll work
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:10:41 Also decals
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:10:52 Maybe add some small letters on that flat part
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:11:18 He “edited” it in
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:11:53 It still questionable why u gonna add music into a picture
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:13:56 Some of the locking part probably got welded into irrelevant parts
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:14:23 ok?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:15:15 Maybe wait a little to lock it after you angle the part
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:15:31 Sometimes itll not lock itself properly and bounce back
creations-chat 2022-05-15 16:16:28 Not all whitenames are nice and not all coloured names are assholes
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:23:01 i dont know how to feel about this
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:27:02 I though escape pods in submarine are just pods that floats up to the surface when released
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:27:07 Not a mini submarine
creations-chat 2022-05-15 16:29:41 Guys
I aint no expert here but i think yall are being too cruel at this point
creations-chat 2022-05-15 16:33:55 Alright but, hes just asking how to improve it while yall keep calling him dogshit

I mean the build IS actually dogshit, but at least give some criticism on how to improve instead of asking him to delete it and delete roblox
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 16:59:32 People find things that barely resembles a a10 is a a10
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:03:14 Is this an A10 to you?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:04:11 This thing resembles that more then an a10
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:04:41 I hate this platform.
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:05:27 Slap a huge gun on the front and theres the commercial a10
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:06:46 Thats clearly not an a10
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:10:18 Did they really expect a single propeller on the back would replace the thing with 2 jet engines
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:10:36 Ngl most of these vids are kinda clickbait-y
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:12:33 Dont need to worry about heat seaking missiles when that thing so immobile a well placed portable anti air launcher can blow it up
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:13:40 Alright fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 17:13:52 But can it reach the infantry before they all get killed tho?

plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:15:27 making a Type 10, hows the front so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:22:32 can u elaborate more
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:23:37 very wide? i feel like it isnt wide enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:23:44 it looks too tall for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:23:47 thanks anyways
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:25:45 yea i really dont know how to hide them motor wheels without them jaming
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:26:44 ah yea they phase thru the blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:26:57 i think theres not much underneath
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:27:04 can be easily dealt with
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:27:07 i think
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:27:40 ill see what i can do
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:27:43 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 07:28:01 wrong guy
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 07:09:26 Fixed some parts regarding to the height, its now half a block lower but no more motor powered wheels, how this for a type 10 now?

(replied message for comparison)
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 07:10:39 fuck is a irobot
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 07:11:07 so u assume all tank hulls is a massive roomba
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 07:11:08 ok.
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 08:06:28 m looks great so far

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:38:55 no fr the fuck is happening help
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:39:35 i cant build like this i dont feel tres bon
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:40:08 imma switch servers
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:40:56 and its still the same
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:41:08 maybe its a bug im gonna do something with it
bug-reports 2022-06-03 07:42:26 any graphic higher than 2 and this happens, no other things are installed and activate atm, i assume it is a bug
bug-reports 2022-06-03 07:42:41 can't really build like this it really fuck up my vision
bug-reports 2022-06-03 09:06:59 other games have no such problem
bug-reports 2022-06-03 09:07:06 plus im not using microsoft
bug-reports 2022-06-03 09:07:17 but ight
bug-reports 2022-06-03 09:17:10 Huh so it probably isnt my computer issue if it happens to more then 1 guy
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 09:42:36 Love how we call it namnam jets like he put a patent on that design
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:40:00 Are u american
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:40:06 If yes, then cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:40:16 If no, then im here to declare that youre fucked
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:40:43 Ight fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:41:12 It flew at low altitude?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:42:23 Both
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:42:28 Vanilla for stability
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:42:33 Glitch for extra speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 15:57:13 Looks fine, the head looks great but the main body feels lacking
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:35:50 Those 2 parts are welded to the main part because of the camera
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:36:08 You need to separate them even more
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:37:39 The average kid toys
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:37:56 The hull looks pretty good but the comical missile placement completely ruined it
creations-chat 2022-06-04 03:38:40 Lambogini Van
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:39:30 Why even adding unshootable missiles anyways
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 03:39:56 Add a proper barrel, remove the silly colourful buttons on top of the turret and you got a pretty good toy
creations-chat 2022-06-05 23:49:39 No way he came back (real)
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:05:50 God i wish he enable the comments
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:07:28 Thats why i wish he would
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:07:34 I wanna see hell itself
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:09:28 He made only one pc vid and that is that
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:10:22 I envy yall for your large amount of spare time
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:12:59 Ill be waiting for you to come up on the news
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 05:17:15 Looks quite clean overall, the proportions are also well done
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 05:17:38 The engines need some fixing tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 05:33:03 I highly doubt we have millions of players to annoy
creations-chat 2022-06-10 01:32:18 Wait real?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 09:51:48 Average roblox discussions
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 04:09:19 Man i wish i have that sort of smooth graphics
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 04:09:47 Everytime i open pc now its filled with bright red and green light all over the map
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 04:09:54 Literally unplayable
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 05:07:52 downbad but tbh it seems better than the "facilities with a massive core" found in public
creations-chat 2022-06-15 10:57:26 There’s humour?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:50:05 alright im back from whatever the fuck i was doing and nearly finished my Type 10 hull, how it is looking so far?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:51:50 should the turret be 2 blocks tall? i fear it would look too tall from the side but the type 10 blueprints said so
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:55:06 
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:55:14 
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:55:33 damn the colours look bad when i lower the graphics
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:55:38 thats subjected to change anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:28:51 yea i think this could do
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:29:00 god the sides are fucking nasty
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:29:11 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:29:13 type 10
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:29:59 should look less than a russian slope turret on the final product
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:30:40 if i dont make the turret turnable the sides would be way better
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:31:02 no brick armour needed
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:31:24 you know what fuck all im not going to make the turret turn
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:31:30 better looks than functionality
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:32:24 maybe he got his rank when motorlock isnt a thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:32:26 come back
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:32:29 and is impressed
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:33:13 yea but u need to reset camera angles everytime u unload your build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:33:57 yea no
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:02 motorlock is more reliable
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:38 well if the piston dont bounce back it is
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:22 it sometimes will bounce back depending on how lag your computer is
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:27 just like normal angle locks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:50 i think theyre gonna implement a completely new method of doing this sort of thing in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:29 just remember 1 locked motor will decrease the length in 2 parts by 0.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:36 its originally a glitch
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:49 they just keep it because it seem useful
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:31 well thats good
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:00 motorlock is optional jesus
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:23 if you can make your things well then it might not be necessary to use it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:33 they are just there to add in extra details and accuracy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:02 i mean yea its handy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:12 babft needs to grind to make better build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:24 by the time i have rescaling i already grow tired of it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:19 he'll understand how this shit works eventually
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:42 i just use 1 or 2 towers and have a few branch extending
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:47 most of the times
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:12 i mean you could
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:20 i just do it that way
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:47 good luck on pursuing your dream
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:44 massive fucking tank is indeed kinda boring
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:50 well depends
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:03 sometimes they take 2 minutes and sometimes 20 weeks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:22 gl
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:03 better not be exposed
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:43 motor 2 itself will work, its just the block (usually the wing) wouldnt, causing the motor 2 to fuck itself
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:03 thats why u hide the motor 2 inside the body and expose the wings
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:22 for the bigger wings, i usually use control panels for that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:28 since turning is much easier
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:36 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:47:27 i build the nose first and a motorlock tower at the back of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:47:42 i dont really build biplanes so im not sure
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:48:18 maybe build the main frame and then put the tower in the body behind the pilot seats
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:52:22 Well than dont make it roscale
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:52:30 Make it the size you feel comfortable with
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:54:29 Well it doesnt have to be TOO large
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:55:00 2 block wide biplane would do the trick
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:55:25 1 block at mid 1 half block on both sides
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:55:29 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:55:47 Good luck
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:57:53 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:58:00 Either use trails or use signs
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:58:18 Alright
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:58:24 It looks ugly
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:00 Guns are literally a full block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:06 Treat them like a full block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:38 They weld against all sides
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:42 For some god damn reason
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:15:37 I have one or two insights
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:15:57 Either use hoverthrusters painted to look like wheels or emoji

plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:16:34 With a \ and a /
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:16:48 Idk i dont really produce a lot of bring ideas
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:21:22 My guess is you want to put these 2 parts together?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:22:15 Well by planes usually its jet fighters
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:22:34 Theyre more structurally easier to do
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:22:35 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:23:11 For bi planes you need to be concerned about how to work with the supporting beams
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:23:43 But thats not a problem on modern planes since they have no exterior support beams
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:24:13 Good old classic
creations-chat 2022-07-01 14:24:54 Tom kruse
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:31:39 I mean yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:31:54 The only part the needs to be concerned is the propeller
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 07:31:49 m looks great so far
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 07:32:12 too bad turret cant rotate but eh

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:45:57 Yea its a type 10 Hitomaru
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:46:11 finally finished the main body
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:46:28 now all i have to do is to add paint on the turret and some extra details
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:46:34 then we balling
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:58:43 magnificent.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 11:57:31 A ungodly amount of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:01:02 Alright, this is the final product of my Type 10, but i dont want to just post it on creations, what Cinematic shots do yall recommend me to make with this thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:01:34 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:01:59 The turret cant turn btw
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:10:06 Chess havent been updates for a few hundred years
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:10:20 So probably wait for yea 400 years
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:10:44 I will wait for Tf2 heavy update

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:16:52 Can the turret rotate
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:18:55 Exposed motor lock

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:19:18 The garage kinda look like it but idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:20:12 Dope
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:20:37 The game is kinda fun but since im using a mac im playing it seconds per frame
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:21:32 I remember some dude slapped a kv2 turret on a really small hull
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:21:46 Somehow its the hardest thing to kill on the server i was playing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:22:08 Me and 2 of my teammates just constantly shoot at it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:22:16 It doesnt fucking die
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:22:40 Yea i do that as well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:22:48 Then they shoot once and i instantly exploded
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:24:47 I mean i find it hard to spot someone because i literally had to set my graphics to 1 to stop having google slideshow gameplay
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 12:26:12 Fuck is a lorer

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:34:28 ok lesson learn today dont bring my heavily motorlocked tank into pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:34:45 because some guy is going to blew it up fuck up all the motors and froze my macbook
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:45:33 well yea but the thing is so aesthetic purposed i didnt bother to add more engines to increase speed and agility
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:51:14 well i tried to slap motors but god damn the wheels always get stucked
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:51:18 hello
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:51:21 nice shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 13:54:32 yea he build one on the pvp server i was in

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:24:33 Wish pvp is a lot more interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:24:49 Its either dogfight for 20 mins straight or get blown into submission instantly
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:25:50 It sounds cool, but it would be practically useless on pc1’s pvp system
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:10 Or hard to move ground builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:13 Real
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:28:30 Motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:28:37 Allows you to fit all 10
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:29:33 I kinda want PvE
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:00 Players combined to defeat a wave of enemies
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:13 Or attack a target with npcs protecting it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:50 Yea definitely better then fuck around wait for some worthwhile opponent to dogfight for 5 mins
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:31:49 PvE boss fight tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:09 Imagine fighting against a Arsenal bird like mothership
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:26 People in pubs are too dumb to know what to votekick
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:38 If they find you annoying theyll kick u and there goes your current progress
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:33:18 Yea but youre panicking can it really save you?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:33:39 I think something like a ignore button would do
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:33:54 If you turn it on said player cannot damage you and you cannot damage them as well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:34:48 Thats why greatest fun in current pvp system is going against your friends
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:34:57 Because the people in pubs are just total assholes
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:35:26 I think pc2’s physic would stop your dreams from going wild give up lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:18 Inaccurate they will memorise nothing but exactly the vk command
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:25 Good luck then
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:33 Maybe it wont look like a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:38:11 While it doesnt solve the issue on pvp i do hope pc2 would reduce lag
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:38:25 Its so annoying when my plane fucking wobbles because of slightly higher ping
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:39:12 I run on a 2012 macbook
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:39:15 Its hell on earth
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:39:18 Literally
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:40:54 I mean like holy shit everytime i make something thats >600 blocks large i can feel my macbook wanting to explode on my face
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:40:58 It’s terrifying
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:41:46 It doesnt matter for others my mac can still handle
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:41:59 But for some reason it always just hates my own build’s size
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:26 Block spam is hella inefficient
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:40 One time theres this kid on pub who make a block spam lag machine
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:46 He thought it work because he is lagging
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:54 No one else on the server feel anything
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:43:19 I mean their block shits everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:43:30 One block on your plot and they instantly goes to build mode
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:44:28 Cream 😳
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:44:47 I scream
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:45:01 lmao no
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:45:51 Literally the whole summary of public server pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:46:41 Vulpen tut f14
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:46:43 A classic
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:47:27 I mean its a tut f14 their handling is not good to begin with
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:49:04 But eh at least those tut defined the standard of public server builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:49:10 You can always expect to see them
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:50:17 They look like they cant really fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:50:27 I swear those guys are just this unintelligent
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:21 Greyish
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:26 Like good old panzers
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:52:18 Run
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:52:28 He will maul your gunship to bits
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:54:37 Least chaotic public pvp server
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:43:45 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:43:47 hello.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:04 <@513635883069734932> my game got frozen.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:15 this is why i dont go to pvp ffs
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:38 welp fun games, time for me to go i guess
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:41 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:47 but youll be a even easier target
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:51:45 btw.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:51:53 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLnKvQdppvY the nannoc im talking about
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:52:06 in fact i think the guy chasing u literally took the same design
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:20 yea pvp literally no fun
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:48 yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:54:34 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:10 yea thats the 10%
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:16 its always some extremely crazy shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:00 i mean since vulpen's c130 went out i keep seeing multiple in game
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:22 kids.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:33 self explanatory
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:57:30 it doesnt look to complicated to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:06 feel like vulpens tut is more complicated because u need to take time looking in step by step
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:09 cant even do the controls right u just crash the plane when attempting to take off
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:26 glad i never did a tutorial (i only look in simple guides)
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:00:00 look um
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:00:20 go to youtube, search 'motorlock plane crazy'
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:19 nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:51 press 1 twice
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:02:15 it should lead u back to the default 360 degree camera
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:02:55 well that, or manually press c x times (x being how many camera u installed)
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:30 well plane crazy literally make everything very agile

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:11:17 the bot cant handle too many nooos
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:11:39 i simply do not care if u somehow flood this chat with nooos
creations-chat 2022-07-03 06:51:27 I swear these kids dont know how to read the rules

<@809781295500099584> We already have a fucking age limit of 13+ they just keep coming
creations-chat 2022-07-03 06:54:30 They already ignored the 13+ limit i dont think increasing the limit would prevent them from coming in
creations-chat 2022-07-07 11:22:48 Pcc try not to be an asshole (unpossible)
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:42:26 5 minute F18 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:42:44 you know, maybe i should actually properly build a f18
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:42:49 i dont really have one
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:43:01 looks great lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:46:06 yea i should actually properly build one
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 14:46:14 make a ea18g growler of something
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:06:03 is this a decent single seat f18 cockpit?
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:06:13 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:06:47 ill see if i can raise the nose up a bit
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:15:47 
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:15:56 hmm.
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 08:16:04 yea, a bit better now i think
creations-chat 2022-07-09 08:51:50 Oil
creations-chat 2022-07-09 08:57:03 Pc2 leak when i patched the holes:
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 09:00:54 Make it look like a dice
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 09:01:10 Engrish
creations-chat 2022-07-09 09:07:08 Honestly that shit jet would look way better without oil all over the place despite it still looks crap
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:26:45 alright, this should do for the time being
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:27:22 obviously more work still has to be done but im satisfied with its progression
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:35:13 Are they suppose to? I know the sides should be tilted for a bit but i assume its detail that can be easily overlooked on the final product
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:35:47 Son of a
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:35:53 Alright, ill see what i can do
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:36:26 Some basic angle locking on the sides should work like a charm
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:53:21 Yea i think my intakes are fine almost everyone who build a f18 on that scale dont angle the sides anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:53:57 When most of the shit are build it would be easily overlooked
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:54:46 When the whole damn plane is build that small detail would be overlooked
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:54:53 Is this english enough for you
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:56:35 Yea but would anyone really look that hard to find that issue when the final image is taken
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:57:02 yea someone maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:58:28 Every build can be accurate as long as you try
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:58:32 I just didnt bother
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:59:18 The main wings are going to cover a fat majority of the intakes anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 15:59:33 I prefer putting focus on that instead
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:00:10 Fair enough, no builds are going to satisfy everyone
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:01:20 Or get kicked
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:02:07 He couldnt deal with everyone’s shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:02:43 Well its still kind of is
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:02:47 Feels indifferent to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:03:08 Sick
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:03:58 Half block wedge thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:04:00 I think
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:04:04 He flipped it over
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:04:24 Well, gonna flex whenever you can
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:05:15 Do that and ill call the fucking mods
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:05:57 That is sarcasm
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:15:39 Public player activity
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:17:09 Well
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:17:12 There he goes
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:21:36 The katyusha reminds me of those large toy cars that a small kid can fit in and “drive”
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:23:45 Smallest truck
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:24:44 Smallest truck in plane crazy is probably just a few cubes that barely resembles one
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:24:52 Ive seen kids in pubs do that
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:30:37 Wrong, his kayusha is up to scale

For toddlers
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:35:00 
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 16:35:10 Yea ok it makes some sense now
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:03:49 all that locking for such small amount of details
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:04:44 i really need to learn how to use space effectively
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:14:23 Im going to fix that when i start building the back
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:14:44 Wait til you see the bottom of my plan lol 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:17:02 What u highlighted are details that can easily be overlooked
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:17:16 Therefore, your opinions are simply wrong <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:17:51 I dont.

plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:21:19 Fuck no, just ignore everything
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:21:33 Ignore the minor details
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:21:52 Actually fuck it pretend the image is non existent
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:22:04 I apilosize

plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:25:27 Plane craz reddit 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:26:20 Fr plane crazy reddit is one of the shit ive ever seen
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:26:31 Simply put its filled with undes and public builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:27:17 Yea but PCC on reddit is a bloody shit stain
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:27:24 Its way worse
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:27:33 Wtf fr 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:27:57 Good for u, your people are protected
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:28:59 Pcc reddit is just filled with shitty builds trying to be funny
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:30:14 Some guy just take a google image, make caption that barely relates to plane crazy, post it on reddit and get highly praised
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:30:22 Its fucking dumb
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:30:55 Said guy proceeds to call my builds “too detailed” and said its “just a joke” when some other guy called it out
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:32:03 Like bruh no one is laughing you single celled poop sock get smart or come back when you are matured enough to use reddit
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:35:35 Creations arguement
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 08:19:43 structure finally done, details later
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 08:22:07 i think i need to make a better pair of engines
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:20:58 alright, its done
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:21:36 looks great to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:22:05 probably one of the most clustered ahh build ive ever made
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:24:06 its 3 blocks high
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:24:11 i think its enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:24:44 i think the correct size is around 3.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:24:50 4 seems too high to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:46:07 birds eye by top view?
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:46:22 my engines kinda nasty looking tho 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:48:44 yea this angle isnt going to fool a lot of audience 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:48:55 i really need to fix the back a bit
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:49:12 ops mb
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:49:44 idk how to transition the  3 block wide front into the 2 block engine
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:50:01 no shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:50:21 fr tho the layout i use is kind of an eyesore so i just said fuck it
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:50:54 yea i will
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:51:31 im thinking about just laying a block between the 2 engines
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:51:40 like a su
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:52:02 hmm ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:52:16 so i have to fix the engines, and maybe make the tail rudder 4 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:52:32 and yea i took the raaf design
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:53:33 workable, i still got plenty of space to fix those
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:54:26 oh yea right that seems like a good idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:54:39 remove the half blocks at the side, piston lock the 2 engines
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:55:24 i feel lazy thats why i made it
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:55:42 1 block + half blocks on both sides
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:55:44 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:56:20 did u really expect us to mash 2 cubes together 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:57:04 1 block planes feel nice to me because they seem small enough so my computer dont overload and explode on me
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:58:54 3 wide looks like those abomination those public players make
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:58:59 i prefer not.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 10:59:58 i have no idea why kids still copy vulpen's tut
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:00:02 its insanely outdated
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:00:22 can kids on public servers make those shit? absolutely not
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:00:26 stop flexing
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:01:13 well at least they are appropriately scaled
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:01:27 when u said 3 wide i expect you just slap a 1x4 wedge on each side and call it a day
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:02:04 fat

plane-crazy 2022-07-11 11:08:46 You need to unachor those things so they can clip inside

plane-crazy 2022-07-13 08:36:00 Yea couldnt do a 3.5 high rudder  without exposing all the locks
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 08:36:31 3 blocks rudder is too short and 4 blocks rudder is too long

plane-crazy 2022-07-14 01:26:34 Looks like the typical tutorial tanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:53:01 1. Find image of a plane blueprint 
2. Snap a pic of your plane that have the same angle of the image in the blueprint
3. Go to some photoshop apps idk
4. Slap them together make one of them semi transparent so you can see both at the same time
5. Align both image of the plane to see if you do your planes accurately
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:54:12 Yea honestly this place is one of the worst place to ask a genuine question go to <#478584971670454284> if you are in desperate need of help
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:57:00 Military groups are cringe
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:57:36 Most of the times they just show off a bunch of mediocre builds (depends on builders honestly) and blast some overused music
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:59:00 “Military groups” when i tell them a formal military is supposed to be a bunch of organised mature people and not a bunch of loose cringy kids
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:59:32 Eh just search some on youtube and youll see what i mean
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:59:36 Some are actually really good
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 06:59:44 But the rest are just garbage
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:02:07 https://youtu.be/LaoghodE2HA a example
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:02:16 No offence if you actually know these guys
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:02:30 Actually fuck no full offence fuck you for making this dumb sh-
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:04:27 Well some are actually pretty well made
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:04:36 But usually they dont call themselves military groups
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:06:00 As a example or the actual video?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:08:05 Kinemaster
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:23:14 Any build is fun for you to ruin anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:23:27 I suppose their reaction would be louder tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:23:29 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:28:07 Just make a entrance point and a singular convincing room
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:28:21 The plot size basically discourage you to make a infinite looking dimension
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:28:57 Im sure his goal is to make it interactive in game
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:29:51 So a backroom which changes the layout
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:30:16 Reminds me of the moving maze (or something like that idk) movie
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:34:24 Wait, since theres a group with a primary goal of destroying shredder

Do they list you as one of the most threatening guy or something
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:34:49 Damn
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:34:58 Whose the first tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:35:00 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:35:34 Must be a honour to be targeted by these guys then
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:36:00 Well arent surprised
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:36:10 Its fucking roblox afterall
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:36:22 The self righteous ones are often the shitty looking ones
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:37:34 “Meet the spy”
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:42:48 Disconnectors (the thinner part), motors (also the thinner part), texts
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 07:43:38 Thinner part by width not height
creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:56:25 Average roblox discussions
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 08:58:45 Didnt they say they have new locking mechanisms for pc2 tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 08:59:30 Wouldnt that mean traditional motorlocking would not work?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:02:42 Didnt they said building blocks can phase thru each other in build mode making motorlock unnecessary?
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:02:49 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:03:34 Fuck
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:03:38 Guess im kinda stupid
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:04:24 motor 8
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:06:30 I just want a bigger nicer looking map
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:06:50 Current one is small and the terrain is ass
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:07:07 Last time they said the start of 2022, then March, then Summer
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:07:11 Its July now btw
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:08:01 I know, but we just dont know the exact details of how it looks like
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:08:14 Other than infinite ocean and flowing lava
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:08:40 I want a small town
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:08:46 Would be great to make some shots
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:25:21 A sizeable modern town would be better imo
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 09:25:27 Skyscrapers are too far fetched
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 00:47:26 Do not forget the basic default plane with all the pvp weapons strapped on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 00:47:37 Also the vulpen tuts
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 00:47:51 Sometimes the namnam wannabe tuts
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 00:48:32 Occasionally a fat fucking ground vehicle that gets obliterated within seconds and lags the server
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 04:46:52 j20
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:03:14 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:03:27 Looks like someone cram a bunch of shit into it and it look like a abomination
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:03:43 Pretty balls
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:04:33 What are u even making that needs 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:05:33 What
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:05:46 What part even need 2000 blocks here
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:06:55 Angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:07:16 Use the normal square blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:07:37 Use the normal square blocks for angle locking oml
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:09:20 Actually just make it smaller
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:09:33 Big builds like that tend to not run well
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:10:05 Redesign <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:10:41 Seriously it looks chonky as hell
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:11:01 I can probably kick one of the legs and the whole thing falls
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:12:15 I lost 24 out of 25 engines on my plane and it still moves
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:13:29 1 on each side
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:13:32 It looks like a cube
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:13:37 Probably
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:14:21 Yea thats why you should go with smaller lesser amount of legs
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:14:34 Because even when 1 is left as long as the motors are attach it still moves
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:15:03 chunky= fat target= dies faster
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:15:34 Your logic may apply to other games but in pc smaller the size the more better it is
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:15:40 Also performance but thats another thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 06:06:51 Inaccurate wheres the guy with the gun
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 05:02:10 Large amount of thrust
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 11:20:29 Accurate like the actual game
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 11:31:01 Back too wide
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 11:32:44 Me when i got launch straight into the air because i walk too fast towards a fence in roblos
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 11:38:34 He did a free fall
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:00:58 I remember i tried to do that once when i was still an amateur
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:01:12 The engines do not move tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:01:24 Vtol a10
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:01:30 Exactly the a10
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:02:19 Honestly better than most of the “modifications” done by a10 tut followers
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:02:40 Most just lazily apply new paint/ extra bombs and shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:03:54 Some thrust at the front that goes up when you rotate the propellers should do
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:04:08 A14 vtol
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:04:21 Actually looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:07 Use motor 2, motor 1 hella unreliable for those kind of stuff
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:07:36 What those actually exist
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:07:59 Usually if you slap hydrofoil the part would just sink into the water
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:08:31 Ik what are hydrofoil boats im just surprise that people actually make them
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:09:00 Because usually it doesnt matter if you have hydrofoil or not the boat just goes the same speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:11:51 I dont think hydrofoil works
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:12:23 Either your boat trips over because it become taller or it went too fast and become a jumpy boat
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:13:06 Persistent mf
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:13:25 If i were him id just give up the first minute
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:15:38 Thats a even slower shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:15:57 Most of the time yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:16:05 Its usually faster because it have more engines
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:16:32 (They love the brrt)
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:16:49 Dumb fools cant use space properly be remembered
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:17:08 Most of the time they just use more cutters instead and add even more weight
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:17:48 “too small” is not a excuse
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:18:03 Ive seen guys who have heli with similar size
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:18:07 And have perfect functions
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:18:48 hi
creations-chat 2022-07-19 14:28:45 For a guy named double wide, his planes sure isnt double blocks wide
creations-chat 2022-07-20 05:17:09 Hof worthy
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 05:23:03 Balling
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 11:35:06 I mean dont need to be ranged when the whole thing is the projectile
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 12:36:41 Should i build the 2fart intel room <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 12:36:55 Suddenly have the urge to do some interior builds
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:41:45 Also you say its not 100% finish meaning its a wip build
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:47:18 I hate this platform as a whole.

creations-chat 2022-07-24 13:58:27 I mean, someone once saw my slightly complicated motorlock build in build mode and call it “motor spam” because their tiny brain can’t comprehend
creations-chat 2022-07-25 04:36:16 Why is your roblox character so fucking dark
creations-chat 2022-07-25 04:38:38 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 10:36:52 Quite inefficient use of motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-27 14:30:01 Not everyone, some make a deflected small squashed B2
