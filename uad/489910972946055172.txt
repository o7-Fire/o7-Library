the-dump 2020-05-18 03:27:44 For a while i couldnt figure out which direction the pilot would face
creations-chat 2020-05-21 19:01:39 <@!583801306871758848> heres me criticism for your su-57: the shape is quite off, the leading edge should be more angled, the nose is too long relative to the rest of the body which also makes it seem as if the wings are too small, the all moving vertical stablizers are too small as well and they should merge with the wings, the engines should be connected on the sides, the radar is way too small and doesnt have the correct shape, the shape of the vertical stablizers are incorrect for both the angle and dimensions are off, the cockpit rises too abruptly and the shape of the canopy is off, so is the nose. Yes, i have built a t-50 pak fa before. My rating would be 6/10, not too bad

creations-chat 2020-05-24 02:01:11 <@!583801306871758848> uh so u asked for f-22 feed back so uh here it is :/     the shape of the intakes are way off, on the real f-22, they're parallel to the direction the nose is pointing, not slanted towards the nose, this mistake messed up the rest of the plane, causing the wings to look as if theyre distorted. the proportion of the nose and wings are kinda weird, the wings look as if theyre dilated or something. The shape of the horizontal stablizers is wrong, the side closer to the front of the aircraft should be parallel to the side farther away. the shape of the vertical stablizers are off, in dimensions and angles. The canopy is cut off too early by the raised neck and the shape of the canopy in general needs fixing... your f-22 has similar problems as your su-57

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 17:13:19 <@!435817391113371668> the looks of the cannon should be simple, so it's more versatile and we can fit it into all types of builds, not just medieval looking things

the-dump 2020-06-26 16:36:59 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"

creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:40:17 thats not cartoony

creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:46:36 the cartoon-like style aims to exaggerate features that makes the plane more unique
creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:47:18 that one doesnt, its basically a mig-29 squished to an extent where its barely recognizable
creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:48:35 if he painted it a different color, i would have guessed that its a f-15 with one frame

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:52 dude im referring to real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:40 i think thats why coaxial is unlopular cus they need almost three times the fuel to run that stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:56 even if theyre rotating at much slower speeds
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:35 Wait what u mean going down when forward
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:50 Thats what its supposed to do??
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:55 O
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:07 well not duh
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:20 theres a special configuration where it doesnt have to do that
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:47 Crap nvm that
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:07 why motor 2 shaky boi tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:42 aerodynamics in this game kinda trash too
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:16:08 I dont think rick has ever thrown a paper airplane
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:16 I always set to 1000 befause that was peast deviaion
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:45 Jeez my typing
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:52 its how powerful the rotor is
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:55 or motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:18:19 Its best to set it to max tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:18:35 Change speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:10 Why do people mess with torque, its a variable that canbe removed so easily
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:23 Its best to have one variable at once
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:58 weirdo
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:20:44 :)
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:21:56 Yo whats wrong with the video?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:22:22 i dont see the problem rlly
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:22:29 Unless its lift offset
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:22:56 its heli boi
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:23:45 by pull up do u mean increase collective or pitch backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:07 dude thats iust ricks supid aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:22 so pitch backwards
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:25:42 If u want the flight characteristic to be inherently stable, pitch the blades up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:27:36 <@!404539659440488468>try to make a single main rotor helicopter in the future lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:28:17 u could but...
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:28:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:28:37 I only do that for guns
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:28:48 Aiming with rocket is pretty ez
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:29:28 *show me*
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:29:38 :(
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:30:04 i made a smol cobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:30:45 The cgi tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:33:43 ppanes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:12 no it wasnt lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:16 it was the a12
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:20 Dnjskamenf
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:23 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:34 Wait did the yf12 come before
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:36:57 The engines were revolutionary
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:37:12 Turbojet and ramjet hybrid
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:37:30 Isnt that every airplane basically
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:37:52 dude we’re saying the same things but worded differently
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:38:21 the real rocket plane is the x15
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:38:56 A rocket that had wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:39:21 no the fastest air breathing MANNED airplane was the a12
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:39:40 the x43 was the tastest
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:40:53 depends on the engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:41:11 what if the rocket engine used nitrogen
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:41:18 and air is mostly nitrogen
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:42:18 yeah rockets eat fuel like mad
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:42:34 That would only be possible in the us
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:42:49 Cheap af oil
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:43:34 EmDrive engines bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:43:44 how it wurk
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:44:02 But it provides thrust?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:44:56 is 2000nm enough to go from us to china
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:46:27 
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:47:24 to nddd
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:47:54 dont use missiles, out run the missile, like a chad
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:48:01 a12
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:48:13 imagine being japanese
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:48:37 cheap labor 100
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:49:29 How da fok
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:49:34 Im already in highschool
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:49:57 a
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:50:33 mym
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:50:36 mymtmymh
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:50:44 russian planes chad
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:51:09 P-42, designed to beat the f15, beat every record ever broken by the f15
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:51:31 P42 is a su27 demo
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:52:34 P 42 had a thrust to weight ratio of 2, basically a plane crazy plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:52:52 kbra
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:53:03 j-10tvc can do it
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:53:12 but f22 cant br
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:53:55 No, its not a cobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:54:05 u accelerate too wuickly in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:54:14 So ur not in post stall
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:54:33 tomperform the cobra u have to stall your wings yet maintain aerodynamic shmmetry
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:55:33 Russian planes go up when doing cobra because of their impressive thrust to weight ratio
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:55:57 it usually beyond 90, like 120
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:56:25 no, thats basically everycobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:56:38 Watch the migs, watch the j-10 tvc
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:57:12 it doesnt have to be a su27
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:57:20 but notice how it says angle of attack
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:57:42 youre accelerating so fast that your antle of attack deminishes so quickly
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:58:11 90 to 120 aoa is a deep stall
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:58:39 plane crazy physics doesnt rlly allow that with those super powerful engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:59:16 wot
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:59:47 yeah do vid
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 03:02:43 ive done cobra with tvc
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 03:02:56 pretty crap thanks to rick physics
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 03:33:12 Do u have ur cobra video yet

creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:20:27 unde plane
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:23:18 so youre telling him to get good?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:25:15 i dont get why people ask this type of question, its kinda dumb
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:26:16 yeah but asking other people doesnt help and you know it
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:27:41 so basically u just need someone to name a commercial jet? why cant you do that for yourself? unless you cant remember any, which is unlikely
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:31:58 i dont see how any of the answers were helpful, u just named two of the most well known commercial jets and thats pretty much it
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:33:06 > because its a suggestion?
<@!244238834852823041> so youre basically implying that suggestions arent supposed to be helpful?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:35:57 but i dont see why that suggestion was particularly helpful because if i were that guy asking for a suggestion, i would have suggested your suggestions to myself many times before i asked for the suggestion, and im sure that goes same for him too <@!244238834852823041>
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:38:27 im not focusing on the end result, i dont understand what made your suggestion helpful, and i truly doubt that it was at all
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:39:43 no, again, i dont understand what made it helpful therefore i doubt
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:41:12 its not like he doesnt know his options, so i dont understand why you providing an option that he most likely already know of is helpful
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:44:57 first, its not between, not a dilema, second, you hesitate when deciding because you dont know which icecream would taste better, so telling someone which icecream to get without stating why its better than the other optionsisnt particularly helpful, not to me at least and thats why i dont get it
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:48:00 we werent really arguing, i was trying to describe my inability to understand this weird social phenomenom of “what plane should i make?”
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:49:34 > maybe a custom plane or a plane that transforms in to something

<@!317833859603496971> the cqnopy is supposed to be pointy and so is the nose
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:07:57 but its not whether or not it looks good, its whether or not it looks like the dassault rafale c, the original plane is ugly not my problem im replicating an ugly thing
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:09:42 > <@!489910972946055172> make it rounder, the cockpit on the plane is round and you have a triangular prism as a canopy
<@!317833859603496971> the canopy is literally one block wide, how do i make it rounder?
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:10:51 > by making it bigger smooth brain
<@!317833859603496971> but that would ruin theproportion, i made it so that its exactly ro-scale, i converted studs to ft and built the plane based on the size of the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:11:55 i find disproportionate things ugly
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:49:05 > <@!489910972946055172> that planes canopy is a traingle, in what fucking way is it proportional to an aerodynamic and round canopy
<@!317833859603496971> proportional as in proportionate size to the real aircraft, not shape, i try to give it the best shape while maintaining the proportionate size
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:50:17 dude the canopy is basically a triangle, do u want me to put some flat block on the vertex??

creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:42:57 > wow i dont see why u hurt
<@!718006867808485447> im assuming thats directed at me.... im just surprised that this is getting quite the upvote to downvote ratio even tho i would normally expect it to do much worse
creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:45:39 > that looks like a nighthawk nose
<@!456137975894507521> sr 71 l ;-;

creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:53:35 > and what relevance does your ”pillar of autism” have to my pfp, you litteraly talked about it wtf??????
<@!685909594932773033> your pfp is a picture of a *third reich* soldier yet you find”pillar of autism “offensive
creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:54:51 > <@!718006867808485447> thats the best SU-27M ive seen tbh
<@!280020722431295488> bruuh BRUHH
creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:58:36 no??:   Theyre the same thing
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:02:29 the su 35S has thrust vectoring
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:05:30 you guys are kina.... ok *just stop* su33 is carrier variant of su27, su27m is an upgraded su27, the su35 and the su27m ar the same thing, the su35*s* is the newest flanker model with thrust vectoring, the su35*s* has multiple names too, like su35bm and su35-1
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:06:39 i suppose thats why i have that as my pfp
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:09:12 > And so are the 29 30 33?
<@!719168864705052802> the su29 doesnt exist, the su30 is the multirole and has many variants of its own and are all twoseaters, the su33 is the carrier variant, not necessarily an upgrade, just optimized for a different role
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:11:39 su37 terminator:
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:15:14 > Yup 37
> I red so many names i cant remember them all
<@!719168864705052802> su27, su 30, su30mki, su30mkk, su30mkm, su30m, su33 (su27k), su34 fullback, su 37, su 27m (su35), su35s/su35bm/su35-1
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:21:14 should i repost in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:27:19 me
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:30:32 > <@!489910972946055172> posting reference pictures distract the build. If it is "necessary" to include a reference picture within the picture, that obviously means that you didnt put enough time and effort into it. Secondly, you started to post the same message and picture over again which is annoying
<@!456137975894507521> a lot of people say that the nose and canopy is too pointy when in fact thats what the real rafale looks like, and reposting l... i dont have anything new to post so i repost
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:32:25 i thought the issue with reference pictures was that it had upvotes and downvotes too lol, and i dont see how it makes the creation harder to see
creations-chat 2020-11-03 18:11:28 how long is the cool down jesus christ

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:43:20 <@!217336009455566848> apparently motor lock is broken
bug-reports 2020-11-03 19:43:54 the broken feature is now broken

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 22:34:09 thx rick
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 23:39:23 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 23:39:25 yed
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 23:39:26 s
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 23:39:34 broken feature broke so its fixed
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 23:40:39 so in a nutshell, roblox fixed the motor lock glitch but nobody wanted it fixed
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:11:12 > more lag for the potato computers
<@!746383586755870821> no, steam games actually have reduced lag because roblox is shit, my laptop can run csgo at like 140 fps but can only run plane crazy at 100 fps
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:12:21 > plane crazy should be a gae on steam
yesss
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:13:03 no

plane-crazy 2020-11-04 01:34:32 beneficial bugs, thats something u can only find in roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 04:10:54 o_o
general 2020-11-04 22:30:17 how did rick fix mootor lock, did it just start working again or did rick actually code for such mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 22:31:29 how did rick fix motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:32:13 how did rick fix motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:38:37 how is that shitty f-14 getting 54 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:40:20 scroll up a bit, youll find it
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:41:51 Shitty f-14 made by <@!719112686612512819> , also that rocket tank thing is good, u can make the paint less bland and it will be so much better
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:44:11 wdym its not bad its literally cnemalkdne wnand the frames are almost fully emerged into the cqnopy, the intakes ew, the canopy is too fat, the canopy shape wrong, wings cant even fold back to 68 degrees, those vertical stabs ugh no
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:45:46 i prefer the tutorial f-14 over this even though the tutorial doesnt use motorlock it gets more details correct
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:49:29 yeah i can tell its supposed to be an f14, but that doesnt make it not trash, i think it can go down the toilet
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:52:35 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tL5mbCIGMy8 This one isnt perfect but <@!294980570885390346> i dont understand why you would upvote the shitty f-14 even though yours is far better,
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:54:20 > even if its bad you have to consider the guy is probably new and dont like destroy him cause his builds arent realistic
<@!447221768520859659> he might be new, so what? it doesnt deserve 54 upvotes, its still poobi
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:56:32 just because hes new doesnt make a bad looking build automatically look okay, ugh i really wish i had a photo of my f-14 from like half a year ago
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:58:34 you guys can probably go to the search bar and find my f-14, type in platinum strikesz f-14 or something
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:00:09 > I cant find it, send me a picture
<@456226577798135808> dont have one lol lemme go to my older device

<@456226577798135808>  i only found this but i guess its fine
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:10:15 i think im gonna remake my f-14 this time with ultra detail like i put on my sr-71, after i finish the sr-71
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:13:00 no >:), only after im done

creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:47:51 still looks quite different but i think ik what to change
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:50:09 > grrr exposed motor lock poob 🤬
<@!410455661814480896> yeah thats a big problem and gonna cost a lot of votes, but its only 3 blocks tall and i have to shift the windows position relative to the angling motor so... thats the best i can do
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:52:27 if i separate the angled pieces i might be able to hide those motors
creations-chat 2020-11-05 02:55:08 and also fix the problems with it not looking like the actual 🅱️lack 🅱️ird

creations-chat 2020-11-07 03:16:58 this guy’s build is probably more difficult to make than any other f-15, it doesnt necessarily look the best but when it comes to function its definitely the best
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:22:39 the front lacks detail, same goes for the wings, they look too discrete
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:27:01 too much exposed stuff, not smooth, generally unpleasant to look at, paint sucks too
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:28:34 > Can anyone join me and tell me what i can improve?

<@!557015565374455808> 👍👌if u could add frames on the glass canopy that would be super nice but its probably super difficjlt too
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:35:37 <@!683105477000822875> skinnier and smoother fuselage, longer canopy, larger and more swept wings, have one large vertical stablizer, not a bunch of small ones, redo paint, *in a nutshell: start over*

creations-chat 2020-11-08 05:07:03 no, simply looking is and building is building in approximate value, it’s not nearly as precise <@!712066592854245486>

creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:28:28 <@!572411935669354528> if this was a court case, you wouldnt need all that, he said that he “will never admit,” thus declaring that he will not tell the truth, so anything he said in his defence is not credible

agreed, building in this game, especially with motor lock, is like figuring out a puzzle, you dont learn how to solve puzzels from looking at the answer keys

creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:58:16 <@!312206191575171083> i usually prefer somewhat roscale builds, but no big deal... if u could motor lock those things on the wings why not motor lock the frames on the canopy too, also the control surfaces, especially in the back arent very pleasant to look at
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:00:48 wip ig
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:03:10 i have a lot of crticism for my own blackbird thats why im still building the front after ive started for a month now
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:04:52 > So can u help me with the frame like how to tilt the front part
<@!479305807674998804> which mig is it lol idk my migs very well ill pull up a photo doe
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:07:28 im looking at the blueprints and it appears that the canopy looks more slanted, i would just use 1x2 wedge and half wedges instead of a wedge and 1x2 half wedge actaully no scratch that
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:09:14 i would still use a 1x2 wedge tho, its approximately a 1x2 triangle, 30, 60, 90 triangle <@!458012038594166795> im talking about the canopy
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:13:45 <@!312206191575171083> i was thinking of a very tall motor stack that would be able to hide the motor two and hide caps for the control surfaces too... but yes better
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:16:59 you can get very precise, the fuselage of my sr71 (excluding the slightly raised cockpit) is 2.76 blocks tall.. thats actually an estimate
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:19:35 Lock delta wings into the glass and angle trails with locked motors, requires building an enormous motor stack thats also toggleable
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:21:14 np, but i suggest that you at least give it a try
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:26:46 um, i think it looks better with 1x2 wedge for the glass, not the regular wedge
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:29:55 <@!479305807674998804>
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:34:26 tbh i would do a very different nose design if i were to make a mig25, much better but the frame
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:36:23 older design of my sr71 but i think the 1x4 triangle wedges could be used for the mig25
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:39:34 <@!479305807674998804> u can make this black nose cone a 2x4 pyramid with 1x4 triangular wedges, but dont do it if u dont like it ig
creations-chat 2020-11-11 01:02:09 not hate
creations-chat 2020-11-11 01:05:56 <@!566765848354750514> smooth it out first, the nose doesnt look right, the canopy doesnt look right, its missing frames too, the wings arent angled down, those ailerons have gaps, motor 2 visible

<@!195253906333368320> how about revamp how engines work, they should accelerate slower but allow for a much higher max speed

plane-crazy 2020-11-13 00:49:37 revamp aerodynamics, the current mechanisms are evidence that rickje has never thrown a paper airplane in his life
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 00:52:29 for a plane to fly straight without changing direction in this game, the center of mass and the center of pressure have to be ontop of each other, but thats not the case for planes in real life
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 00:53:05 the center of pressure for most fighter jets are well in the front of the center of mass
general 2020-11-13 00:55:48 > Like studying it’s stealth stuff or something
<@!673397945764151336> bro the f-117 stealth techniques are so outdated, all the new stealth planes have completely different designs, theyre much rounder.. thats because we have super computers now
general 2020-11-13 00:55:57 and the f117 paint was terrible too
general 2020-11-13 00:56:27 even the chinese j-20 has like way better stealth coating than the f117
general 2020-11-13 00:57:07 yeah, f22 and f35
general 2020-11-13 00:57:15 way more maneuverable and way more stealthy
general 2020-11-13 00:57:42 the predecessor of the f117 had a very difficult time flying, its designers doubted that it could fly at all
general 2020-11-13 00:59:22 super rocket
general 2020-11-13 01:00:28 believe it or not, the j-20 has better stealth coating than the f22, its way easier to maintain and doesnt require a complete repaint just for a single scratch, which was the case for the f22
general 2020-11-13 01:00:59 yeah

<@!720891502108344360> chonker? u mean like big boi?
general 2020-11-13 01:02:21 well thats actually a good thing that its big

<@!539537860215439360> the fuselage is too large relative to the rest of the aircraft, extending it will fix the proportion of the planes fuselage relative to the one in real life, but it doesnt fix everything else wrong with it... you either have to make everything else larger relative to the fuselage or make the fuselage smaller, entirely, which requires a complete revamp of the fuselage
