plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:22:36 I present to you:

The mayhem tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:25:22 Those tires have suspension on all of them
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:25:31 That's the mayhem
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:25:58 It kinda was an accidental game crasher for alot people
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 04:01:37 I know how much you guys love the name "plane crazy", but alot of people build machines, and not just planes, so the name doesn't fit very well.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:01:47 Can we please get rid of the winter theme?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:02:25 the ice is really bad for land vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:32 Man for real, the ice is impossible to drive on
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:47 winter wheel?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:53 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:56 not found
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:09:38 look, I'm not gonna replace 120 wheels just because the devs refuse to remove the winter theme
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:15 dude
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:25 I can't drive my vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:27 at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:33 it drifts so hard
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:47 all because of that dum ice
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:07 what do you mean by winter wheels?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:15 I seen no winter wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:24 when scrolling through the building tabs
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:29 ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:52 that just means AGAIN, that you expect me to replace 120 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:06 for something that will be removed in a few months
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:14 what's the point
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:20 it should
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:40 winter officialy ends on march 21st
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:13:00 if it is not removed around that time, it's stupid.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:14:21 now tell me, would you like to spend hours to replace all of this, and repaint?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:34 plus the paint job
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:38 you forget that
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:51 the paint job would take extra time
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:04 do you see how I did it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:31 I colored the whole thing black, and then did the paint job
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:36 because that is quicker
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:44 but still
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:58 on each side
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:31 which roughly adds up to replacing about 120 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:54 man
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:57 nix that
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:20:05 it's probably 240 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:03 I don't care about the lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:08 I can handle it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:24 the design flaw in that machine is lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:22:46 ahhh, good old classism, runs in the  family of the engineering type games, such as bym for example
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:23:06 I see this game is no different in terms of community
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:23:29 Simple terms
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:23:40 I'm calling you judgemental
