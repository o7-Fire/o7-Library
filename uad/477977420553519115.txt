bot-central 2020-10-17 02:16:40 oh wait it was a question mark
bot-central 2020-10-17 02:17:26 the moment i said that discord crashed for me

bot-central 2020-10-17 02:17:52 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:37:35 planes look nice
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:38:58 also darmagon i dont know what you mean by this, maybe youre saying that youre angry at people because of the angle and arold talked about the drone in the photo and i see it now
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:40:00 why is the drone there also damn this slowmode is long
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:41:37 yeah thats a fair point, i feel like this is a place where people would argue
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:44:25 anyways continuing with what i was gonna say, darmagon, maybe youre saying that youre angry at people because they dont fill in the hole (why did i say circle earlier), in that case fair enough, everyone has their own opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:45:50 if you want something that can fill the hole triangle wedge would be perfect, its in the wedges section, specifically the one without any numbers
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:46:51 oh wait, lemme check
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:47:54 lite ray its a drone

creations-chat 2020-11-03 02:55:28 hey guys i need help, what do you guys hate the most, also that bridge is dope and i like it
creations-chat 2020-11-03 02:58:56 i have no idea im just some dude who usually builds things without atleast looking at reference photos and who once got shredded for making an awful tombstone
creations-chat 2020-11-03 03:04:22 what are your opinions on shredder bugs, i personally dont really like them but i think theyre kinda fine as long as they dont use blacklist, also yeah this is also pretty random and this question should probably go somewhere else

also where is motorlock?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 03:58:26 yeah i was kinda expecting it to do awful
but i spent time on it so i might as well just post it
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:01:05 ill try
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:03:54 bottom part of the canopy is done

creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:12:21 ok then, i know how to get the glass material so that wasnt helpful at all, guess ill just do the glass without help

creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:34:40 i didnt even see that edit you made to your message, but if i did see it i wouldve done it faster, also yes legacy glass is horrendous, i just did it for the lols
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:39:23 war crimes i like the ship, dont like the colors though

creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:42:29 yeah me neither

creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:44:28 also im pretty sure everyone in here has me blocked nobody is responding, also those ships are nice
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:45:30 me ALSO DAMMIT THIS SLOW MODE SUCKS AND ALTHOUGH IT IS NEEDED I HATE IT, E
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:46:39 yeah man why you like this?

i didnt even do nothing

also i was talking to 0balance, you guys have a fair point, that canopy was horrendous
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:48:24 i do respect him for that, or her i have no clue honestly

is crinjge a boi or a gril

you know what hes probably a boi, he used man
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:49:33 the hell is an unde
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:54:32 only used legacy glass to make <@!720751430595772418> have big anger

and also mightve used it before that but even then i think that was before we got the new glass in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:55:58 people use legacy glass either because their dumb or they want to make people have big anger

is reason why <@!720751430595772418> has blocked me
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:57:00 no idea
creations-chat 2020-11-03 04:58:54 also a good way to make people have big anger is make a build with default colors, low effort, and it doesnt look like what its supposed to at all, i learned this when i made tombstone from battlebots, which you can see in this picture i took when i posted it, i eventually just removed it and then cleared the save

AW HELL FORGOT THE PHOTO
creations-chat 2020-11-03 05:00:17 alrighty im done waiting for one minute, heres the picture

creations-chat 2020-11-03 05:01:31 also hey atleast i didnt use blacklist

shredders can shred easier

they dont just bounce off

blacklist is fine to use, just not in a way to exploit cutters
creations-chat 2020-11-03 05:03:47 bye ill post more legacy glass lol
creations-chat 2020-11-03 18:39:10 someone needs to try that
bug-reports 2020-11-04 05:41:05 why do i have twice of every block?
bug-reports 2020-11-04 05:42:21 fixed now
bug-reports 2020-11-04 05:42:23 thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:44:03 okay atleast when i created that one shredder that got hated so much i deleted it, it was trying to look like something, THAT THING YOU MADE IS JUST A SHREDDER

what even is the shredder supposed to look like calmity?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:46:26 the closest thing i can think looks like that shredder is a sword fish but even then it doesnt even look like it, the only similarity is the sword
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:48:55 unless you have sharp nails
introducing weapon concept one, sharp nail
deals as much damage as cutter, but it just breaks in one hit
its basically just cutter but you cant cut anymore blocks with it after you use it
after you cut something the nails break and your masterpiece of a build is in pain and sadness
moral of the story, cut your nails, you might break them
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:51:42 sounds like zeppelin wars
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:53:39 also ima go and remake the bt-100's semi itself, not the trailer, thats gonna stay.  im talking about the part of the semi that pulls the trailer

also i agree with ravi we need both
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:56:33 OH I HAVE AN IDEA, give the mech an ak47 made out of ak47s
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:58:33 finished deleting the part of the semi which moves it, all thats left is the trailer

im gonna start from scratch now (not the programming thingy)
creations-chat 2020-11-04 06:18:04 dont worry i downvoted it as well
creations-chat 2020-11-05 20:33:41 im learning
creations-chat 2020-11-05 20:51:41 it was deleted because of spamming

god dammit why

im just tryna learn how to motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-05 23:03:41 i have no clue at all
creations-chat 2020-11-05 23:11:25 yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-05 23:13:35 the man behind the thing which caused people to cease vital functions
creations-chat 2020-11-05 23:15:08 i agree with <@!221487880487436288>

(also purified water is nice name)
creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:20:18 SPEED!!!!!!!
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:50:36 also what happened to crinjge?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:52:26 do i have any logs?

bot-central 2020-11-11 21:33:16 ?shelp
creations-chat 2020-11-14 21:48:19 i like this kayak
creations-chat 2020-11-17 06:26:22 if you like it and you want to build it, then build it.  thats my opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-17 06:39:20 great now i wanna make ice box
creations-chat 2020-11-17 07:42:10 oh shoot yeah forgot about that

ima do it tommorow

and also probably weaponize it like i did with my semi

also while editting this a second time this dude below me said this and even though i probably will never be in the voice chat i agree, stop with the music
creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:42:27 ima switch to light theme just to see what light users see, time for my eyes to be tortured

nevermind thank you
creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:44:47 what the unholy hell

i like and dont like that at the same time
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:00:23 same reason as the person above me
creations-chat 2020-12-02 18:36:57 m60 looks dope
