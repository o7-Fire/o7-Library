general 2021-03-25 05:04:03 yeah first black astronaut
general 2021-03-25 05:04:11 
general 2021-03-25 05:04:34 i remembered it from his color because of the first black astronaut
general 2021-03-25 05:04:37 not because i'm racist
general 2021-03-25 05:04:42 it's just immediately what popped up in my head
general 2021-03-25 05:04:52 some correlation with first black person to do something
general 2021-03-25 05:04:55 so i searched it up
general 2021-03-25 05:04:57 bro
general 2021-03-25 05:05:00 are you kidding me
general 2021-03-25 05:05:05 you sound like a fucking snowflake
general 2021-03-25 05:05:20 you're telling me i should use african american
general 2021-03-25 05:05:26 it's the same thing man
general 2021-03-25 05:05:30 what?
general 2021-03-25 05:05:32 what do you mean
general 2021-03-25 05:05:38 it's not even like i implied it in an offensive way
general 2021-03-25 05:05:42 i even mentioned why i said black
general 2021-03-25 05:06:05 how is this in any way offensive?
general 2021-03-25 05:06:17 that's how i remembered, i was looking for it
general 2021-03-25 05:06:26 plus with all the blm stuff
general 2021-03-25 05:06:32 black lives matter, not african american lives matter
general 2021-03-25 05:06:33 it's teh same thing
general 2021-03-25 05:06:42 i don't understand why you're getting so offended at me saying black
general 2021-03-25 05:06:51 exactly, it's the same thing
general 2021-03-25 05:07:07 oH nO tHat'S ofFenSive
general 2021-03-25 05:07:09 that's your mind process
general 2021-03-25 05:07:19 i wasn't talking to you i was talking to jxfilid
general 2021-03-25 05:07:32 he was saying why i said black since it was "too offensive"
general 2021-03-25 05:07:55 it really doesn't make a difference
general 2021-03-25 05:08:03 unless you're using it offensively, of ocurse
general 2021-03-25 05:08:08 i replied to you
general 2021-03-25 05:08:17 i literally mentioned he was the first black astronaut
general 2021-03-25 05:08:23 <@!546223347025969164>
general 2021-03-25 05:08:26 you^
general 2021-03-25 05:08:58 this is getting verbatim
general 2021-03-25 05:09:02 i explained why i said it
general 2021-03-25 05:09:05 i explained it wasn't offensive
general 2021-03-25 05:09:08 you keep saying the same tihng
general 2021-03-25 05:09:11 im not going any further
general 2021-03-25 05:09:13 new topic
general 2021-03-25 05:09:30 okay well i'm not because i didn't use it in an offensive way
general 2021-03-25 05:09:46 plus me mentioning that he was the first black astronaut, wouldn't that be something complimenting
general 2021-03-25 05:09:53 i didn't even need to bother saying that
general 2021-03-25 05:10:11 i've said black a handful of times ,nobody's gotten offended
general 2021-03-25 05:10:20 i don't know where you'er from but where i'm at nobody's gotten offended
general 2021-03-25 05:10:31 some including you, like the 1%
general 2021-03-25 05:10:52 you're literally the only one being entitled and complaining about me saying black
general 2021-03-25 05:11:00 are you instigate something
general 2021-03-25 05:11:10 i wasn't implying that you were black
general 2021-03-25 05:11:26 bro
general 2021-03-25 05:11:33 you literally complained
general 2021-03-25 05:11:35 about me saying black
general 2021-03-25 05:11:40 what do you mean you didn't get offended
general 2021-03-25 05:11:45 you could have completely disregarded it
general 2021-03-25 05:11:51 instead of instigating
general 2021-03-25 05:12:14 well man i don't know if you live under a rock but god knows where you are, because where i'm from as i said nobody's gotten offended at me saying black
general 2021-03-25 05:12:20 that's like some snowflake shit
general 2021-03-25 05:12:35 you have to be entitled as fuck to get mad at saying black in a non-offensive way
general 2021-03-25 05:12:43 then waht's the point of saying it?
general 2021-03-25 05:13:19 just no point of mentioning it in the first placec but okay
