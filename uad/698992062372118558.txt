creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:08:50 becoming good in pvp is kinda easy, but now you're good in pvp be good in LOOKS
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:11:05 You get more satisfaction playing something good-looking and being good at pvp than being good at pvp with a weird-looking build

creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:28:04 Like the hell, everything is worng with his A-10, wings, bombs are touching the ground, landing gear is hella small, the cockpit is way too small, and the hell is this mutant fuselage
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:30:21 I also forgot to mention the Avenger canon's ridiculous size
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:34:31 Yes 'cause A-10 is a ground attack aircraft so yes <:PewPew:532303441293344778>

creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:47:20 Does carrying 5 crew members still count? Or did I just do it for it to be massively downvoted in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:49:24 Guess it's option 2 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:27:13 If you don't want to argue then don't
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:29:27 Ah, I see you don't want to argue, after I told you that if you didn't want go, then stop

creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:33:27 Didn't know saying "if you don't want to argue then don't" was pouring fuel on the fire that much
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:35:20 Ok, if you want. Let's continue, here, I violently provocated you by replying.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:37:19 I don't care if it doesn't have motorlock, there's an enormous lack of detail, that's all. And it can be fixed without motorlock
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:39:02 Do you have brain damage ? I just told you I did not care if there wasn't any motorlock in your build, there's just a lack of detail
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:41:48 I didn't but sure

creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:32:40 hella small landing gears, nose not really detailed and not really smooth, color kinda ew and not really detailed interior, too thin wings
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:34:43 worser (real)
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:39:14 Tbh it isn't that bad it's just the back feels disproportionate, like fix the engines and possibly rudder, also nice bringing up old ass build of mine.
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:42:22 Thanks, I appreciate it, now, instead of bringing old ass builds of mine, can you actually more recent builds? Instead of my many months old Felon
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:46:22 It not fish (nerd), also, don't do like you didn't notice the other build, you began trashtalking to me because I said "worser"

creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:57:29 Z axis, change the color to something like blue-ish grey, and try to make the entire thing smoother

creations-chat 2022-07-03 13:11:38 Change glass color to another one and fr make it smoother
