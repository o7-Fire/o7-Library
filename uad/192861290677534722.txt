plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:23:30 k
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:24:44 aight cool  i already follow the rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:25:17 unless theres a "no pinewood" rule that i dont see, and i doubt there is knowing that madattak and diddles are somewhat friends
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:25:19 then im good
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:30:24 wait, why was i refered to the rules and not the other guy?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:30:48 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 02:20:11 
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 02:20:56 i know
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 02:21:10 and it isnt even photoshop
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 02:21:15 it was an actual image
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 04:19:36 MEME STEALER
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:22:17 Go get the die
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:34:50 <#501034677793193994> personally I keep the center of lift in front of the center of mass so the plane tilts up instead of down
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:51:25 Do you use helium?
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:51:34 Strange
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:51:40 You probably have smol planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:51:54 Weird
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:52:22 Your engines are probably above or below the center of mass then
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:53:09 I've made a few vtols, they get unstable at high speeds and I lose control and get the die
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:54:02 But if you have the engines above the center of mass, doesn't matter how far back they are, but if they are high relative to the center of mass they will push the nose down
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:54:27 Or if they are low they will push it up
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:54:53 No I'm saying your probably do
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:55:11 Because idk why it would be most stable to have your lift behind your mass
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:55:39 How
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:56:05 Show me a picture of one of your things
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:56:47 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:58:15 Well if you have jets up front to counteract the downward thrust of the back engines, it might over compensate and that might be why you put the lift behind the mass
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:07:52 Pitch control
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:07:54 Smh
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:01 I just put a ton of rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:07 Because they are better
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:15 Like you should see my planes take off
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:24 Actually no you shouldn't because I would be banned
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:27 But still
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 17:08:29 It's hot
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 20:10:26 Contract the die please
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 14:43:18 isn't it cool How if you takE the capitaLized words of a Phrase they soMetimes makE a word or two.
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 22:15:02 <#490306593242611742> boi summer vacation ended months ago why are you still sending vacation pics
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 22:15:06 and why are they so low quality?
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 22:15:44 i was making a joke but clearly you people arent cultured enough for that
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:37:28 ay fellas check out <#491710474786832394>
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:54:03 what
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:54:06 what i do
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:54:41 wait what
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:55:36 yeesh, you guys are more sensitive than the amish
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:55:42 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:56:06 its alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:56:34 fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:56:36 uuuhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:56:57 fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:57:00 they will take you down with them
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 03:57:22 yeah it just has a light in its mouth
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:00:57 bet
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:01:01 i will make my bots know
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:01:04 they will remember
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:01:07 they will never forget
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:01:37 wait what are we getting his opinion on?
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:02:31 fun fact: pinewood is the first to set up task forces to prepare to fight back the anthros and restore peace to our minds
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:02:57 because he cant listen to his jam
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:03:02 B)
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:03:21 whose that?
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:03:36 i only know kim jong dos
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:03:52 and i think i met tres at one point
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:04:51 fun fact: if you lean back far enough you will not be leaning at all
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:06:06 fun fact: if the anthros take over we're doomed
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 04:06:45 "hey north korea can i have some missiles"
"sure thing north korea"
"thanks north korea"
help 2018-10-17 05:03:27 wrong channel kiddo
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 16:31:32 I'll just create a Roblox plugin that makes it so the anthros look like normal people on my screen
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 17:08:15 Yeah, I thought that too until I found loading simulator
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:11:14 Someone say future?
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:11:26 Aight then
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:11:51 Every chat k touch dies
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:11:53 Whyyyyy
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:12:10 That's called a snail
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:13:39 No fucking swearing
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:14:10 Smh you sonofabitch
the-dump 2018-10-17 17:14:49 Yeah you better get the fuck outta here before the god damn mods ban you for fucking swearing
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 19:06:11 In my experience, a tail is not needed
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 20:01:58 I use rockets to change my plane's direction, and wings for stability and quicker direction change
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:20:27 Fun fact: add pole blocks to the game please, whenever I try to make a sling shot the blocc gets stuck and if I try to fire the slingshot everybody and everything dies
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 05:53:20 somebody tell me why beyblades are one of the most common creations for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 02:09:21 what if aliens havent responded yet because they dont want to look desperate?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 02:18:31 no weebs
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:46:38 That face when you build a massive suspension cannon and some guy builds a small magnet cannon that's 5x faster
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:48:48 It does good at what it does
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:48:56 Make things **wiggly**
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:49:21 And pistons are used to squish the suspension to make cannons
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:49:47 But magnets are apparently much easier and better -3-
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:49:56 But I'm still proud
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:50:02 Because it looks cool
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:50:06 Unlike magnet cannons
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:51:16 No magnets work on their own
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:52:49 Dern
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:09:54 Nerd
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 23:02:07 when you think about it, humanity is kind of like a hivemind
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 23:02:26 we send our thoughts, ideas, and feelings to potentially everybody in the world, and if people agree, it changes the whole of humanity.
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 14:54:24 Is it normal to talk to yourself when nobody is looking? I've been discussing with myself and I honestly have no idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 14:57:14 I help myself figure out problems
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 14:57:16 Is fun
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 14:57:43 So yeah it's pretty helpful

plane-crazy 2018-10-23 16:01:18 Club penguin battle royale
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 17:12:29 In entrepreneurship class we had to do a project where we go for a month with only $1000
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 17:13:19 Eeee fine
general 2018-10-23 17:14:47 My plan was to buy a shovel, foam mat, sleeping bag, and tarp and a bike. Then go and dig a hole and for a house
general 2018-10-23 17:15:37 Then buy a cat to keep the moles out of my house and a buy some cat treats to keep it from plotting against me
general 2018-10-23 17:16:17 I ended with $700 left over while the second best guy ended with $340
general 2018-10-23 17:16:21 SMH noobs
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 20:41:39 You better delete that shit before I delete your subscription to life
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:27:41 shush child i agree but only when it isnt on bagels or in cheese cake
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:14:24 dont you love it when your magnet cannon defies the laws of physics
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:29:31 fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:29:32 
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:29:34 this flies
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:30:14 aight then
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:30:16 join me
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 03:30:21 anyone is allowed to follow me
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:33:57 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:33:59 this flies
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:34:11 its beautiful
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:47:54 well, it flies with the correct RNG
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:47:58 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:48:07 because it kinda stutters
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:51:18 but whenever it flies its a sight to behold
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:55:16 <@!163143541160148992> what rank does building a plane based on defying physics get me?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:32:55 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:33:01 it flies
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:35:11 yeah but nobody seems to be listening because i havent gotten a rank >:/
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:09 Do I have a rank for my physics breaking plane yet?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:11 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:17 I'll try again in a few jours
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:19 Hours
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:33 Not for a while
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:44:36 I'm guessing g
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:45:22 If big mans adds sensors and logic gates, mahbe
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:45:23 Maybe
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 14:51:35 If that gets you inventor role then what does making a plane that runs on the defiance of the laws of physics get you?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 15:02:23 It's a rectangle you uncultured swine
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 16:37:51 Dear people

I get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 16:47:18 sus
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:07:30 Next update we need timers so that we can do stuff and things

creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:14:46 oh well
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:16:14 so i get rank or nah
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:16:15 neat
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:16:44 lowest rank for a plane thats powered by the breaking of physics
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:16:45 oh well
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:16:46 ill take it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:17:17 aight
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:17:22 bad bot
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:21:22 it can get up to 1,000
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:21:37 will need a few more magnets to get up to 2k
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:23:17 does it have to be controllable AT 2000 speed?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:23:49 ill see what i can do

creations-chat 2018-10-24 22:52:17 neat
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 22:57:16 <@!252094891448860673> is the warp drive just the super rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:00:44 oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:00:51 i just get the warp drive for going fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:00:54 i thought it was a
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:00:55 thing
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:00:59 oh well
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:01:08 still neat
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:01:33 yeah i did
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:02:08 i did
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:02:14 i was just confused
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:02:26 i thought i got a warp drive thing for going fast
general 2018-10-25 15:53:05 Welp
general 2018-10-25 15:53:23 Im at the dentist waiting to get my wisdom teeth removed
general 2018-10-25 15:53:26 Rip me
general 2018-10-26 01:01:48 when i came out of surgery earlier today, i talked in another chat and i made the best sting of messages i've ever created
general 2018-10-26 01:01:49 
general 2018-10-26 01:02:07 "they put you on that addbdtjfj"
general 2018-10-26 01:02:54 yes everything stopped being awkllfly
general 2018-10-26 01:03:01 i was tripping balls
general 2018-10-26 01:03:09 ye
general 2018-10-26 01:03:16 they put my all the way to sleep
general 2018-10-26 01:03:22 i think
general 2018-10-26 01:03:32 surgeons lie to keep us calm
general 2018-10-26 01:03:40 i thought i was supposed to be slightly awake
general 2018-10-26 01:03:41 weird
general 2018-10-26 01:04:03 yeah but i typed those words, didnt speak
general 2018-10-26 01:04:15 oh
general 2018-10-26 03:21:21 whats worse: my chances of being the first man on mars or the fact that madattak's real name is Barnaby M. Ttak?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:34:18 i got my wisdom teeth out 4 days ago
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:34:22 and im only allowed to eat soup
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:34:27 i havent pooped in 4 days
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:34:56 yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:35:48 thats probably because you dont have enough rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:35:52 more rockets = better
general 2018-10-29 14:37:05 
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:55:05 Keep saying "add longer rope" in <#491710474786832394> until someone actually considers it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:55:29 Usually works
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:10:16 I cant
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:10:31 Mobile is illegal for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:19:20 Don't you hate it when the dentist's steal your wisdom teeth and you have to be absent from school for 2 days and you get behind on everything?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:24:44 My cat judges me all the time
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:24:53 Let's see if it rubs off on me
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:37:14 Apparently make something weigh more because it makes the centre of mass move closer to the helium block
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:43:10 Ignore it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:43:14 Tah dah
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:43:16 Fixed
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:47:43 Yeah, but outside of the arena you have to use rail guns
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 16:53:13 You fix that by getting better aim
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:01:52 No we already have rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:01:58 3 different flavors
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:02:00 Small
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:02:01 Big
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:02:03 And super
general 2018-10-29 18:57:08 How did you guys watch an image
general 2018-10-29 18:57:11 Like damn
general 2018-10-29 18:57:13 Magic
general 2018-10-29 19:35:35 Nah 🅱 it's an image
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:49:38 How good of a thing do we need to make in order to get inventor role?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:16 A flipper bot
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:18 Good idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:22 I shall make it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:35 I shall make it better*
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:52 🅱et
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:56:17 By the power of autism, I shall make bad things even worse!
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:58:28 I have a better idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:58:35 And I shall make it when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:58:39 Everything shall be flipped
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:59:57 Heh
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:01 That's what I thiught
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:09 But I made a warp drive using magnets
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:11 11/10
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:49 No it just keeps pushing
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:57 The magnet pushes on the other magnet
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:01:00 Pushy pushy
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:01:15 And it eventually yeets up to tens of thousands of speed
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:01:39 But you have to design it a specific way or Roblox will know the magnets are attached to eachother
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:02:42 Or blow
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:02:55 I shall show you to power of magnets when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:03:35 No, real life isn't roblocc
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:20 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:24 Supersonic engineer
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:29 What are the requirements
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:54 Pfft
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:55 Easy
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:59 I got this
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:10 I already have the warp drive rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:13 Should be easy
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:37 Shush small bean
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:45 It is a simple build and I will prove it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:35:17 Probably
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:39:53 🅱et
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:06:42 Fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:06:45 Add logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:07:16 Too bad
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:15:32 ODers are roblox's main source of income
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:15:41 Soooo they have to advertise for them
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:15:51 Aka make "cool" clothes
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:16:27 But don't hate on the kiddos
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:16:51 Because that just means you're turning into the older generation that hates everything the younger generation is doing
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:28:48 We need a bigger work space
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:28:56 I'm finna make a flying aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:29:52 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:30:10 Smh Rick has big bad
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:22 Also logic gate :3
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:35 I'm just saying they would be hella nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:45 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:31:59 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:12 The things you could build with logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:22 Actually viable vtols
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:33 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:13 Yeah but the vtols are annoying to pilot, and logic Gates would help a lot
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:34:04 <#490306593242611742> yay
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:35:29 Rip
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:37:33 Suspension cannon, can fire pretty much any size projectile that fits in it. I don't have the details but im pretty sure the part count is around 750.
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:38:17 I meant I'm at school and I'm reposting it because nobody ever responded
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:04 And it looks hella hot when readying up and loading it
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:46 I'm actually pretty sure it's more than 1000 but I said 750 just to be safe
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:40:34 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:40:50 Nope
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:40:57 I'll get a gif when I get home
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:41:08 But the readying process takes a bit too long for gyazo gif
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:41:20 So it would be preferable if you were in-game
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:41:41 And what's the double land requirement?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:42:25 <@295568493166985218>
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:03 K
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:15 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:34 Nah 🅱 the cannon still works when wet <@295568493166985218>
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:00 Doesn't require land
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:03 It also floats
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:05 B)
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:24 When firing, it moves around quite a bit in the water
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:38 Hec
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:47 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:50 A solid maybe
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:46:15 It's a suspension cannon
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:46:43 Oh it hella lags because of the suspension
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:46:59 But it doesn't count on lagginess, just part count
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:08 But I gotchu 🅱
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:26 Does it have to move in the water or just float?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:46 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:48:17 That's called a submarine
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:48:55 Also I think the US Navy made a boat that capsizes all the time
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:49:05 But it floats back on top
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:49:19 The Navy boat?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:49:57 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:50:48 No wait it was a police boat
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:51:18 It looks like a speed boat except the cabin is air-tight so the pressure of the water pushes it back up-right
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:51:36 And idk how to find it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:51:54 Also, would planes be considered to require land?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:34 The land requirements are doubled, so would planes have double requirements or would they be normal because they are in the air
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:45 K
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:53:31 Aight I'll make my suspension cannon fly because that sounds stupider than making it float
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:54:05 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:54:15 The recoil isn't THAT bad
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:54:35 And the loading mechanism is able to load the cannon while falling
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:56:18 Once I'm done with the Titan cannon, I'm going to make a rail cannon and see how hot I can make it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:00:09 I decided I'm just going to make it float because I just realized that making it fly would mean I have to keep it balanced
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:00:27 And that would be rather difficult
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:03:00 But I think I should get inventor role for it, because I haven't seen any suspension cannons, and I'd say it's an original idea-ish
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:03:35 But eh, I'll just make something else to get it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:04:43 Magnet cannons, definitely, but suspension cannons are rather hard to do
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:05:12 Because the blocks seem to have more friction than a snake's skin
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:05:31 Idk something with lot of friction
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:05:37 Oh wait, tires
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:06:31 What do you mean by that?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:06:50 The projectile isn't lose until it's ready to fire
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:06:56 Loose*
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:07:09 Because if it was loose, it would jam the cannon
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:07:26 Make the projectile hover?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:08:56 It already fires smoother than a buttered up baby
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:09:00 But I can try
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:11:22 I remember in it's early stages, when I fired it at a bacon hair, he got flung really far
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:05 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:46 It's called a suspension cannon, not a rail gun
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:13:34 Kinda
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:14:14 But the way it readies up and loads is so h0t
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:14:25 The military would be proud
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:14:32 If they used springs
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:15:37 If I made a rapid-fire rail gun would that count?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:15:44 It fires multiple shots
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:15:54 And fires them in quick succession
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:01 Secession
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:03 Whatever
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:37 Eh, I'll think of something when I'm home
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:48 Anyhoo, gotta go
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:36:31 You know what would be cool?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:36:39 **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:37:07 Wait do you really not know what I'm talking about?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:37:22 Smh
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:37:35 A bunch of people want sensers and logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:37:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:38:12 You know, and gates, that take 2 inputs and of they are both active it returns an active
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:38:24 Kinda like nimbatus
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:38:56 Or gates, xor gates, nand gates
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:38:59 Things like that
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:39:02 Aight cool
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:40:04 A lot of people like the idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:40:13 It will allow for automated drones and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:40:28 And it shouldn't be too difficult to program
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:49:25 But yeah, nimbatus basically has the perfect logic gate and senser system, so you can base it off of that
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:00:23 So the Navy is going fishing now?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:00:44 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:00:46 The cird
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:00:48 Cord
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:41:34 Are there copy paste hot keys?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:51:02 
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:51:53 Who is a pixel artist
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:54:57 The wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:55:04 More wingg
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:55:33 There's a reason ostriches don't fly
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:55:37 Not enough wingg
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:55:48 But they have much legg
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:57:21 No
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:57:23 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 19:57:25 What
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:32:20 If mad really wanted to grow his player base he would add toasters to his games
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:32:45 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:32:59 Oh the control flaps
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:33:07 I thought you meant decoration things
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:33:24 Ye that
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:33:43 Control surfaces would be really good with **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 14:38:46 Roblox>twitter
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:00:07 Roblox physics are bad because if you give a block negative mass it doesn't go backwards when you whack it
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:03:20 Stop
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:23:15 Wow, text
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:23:20 We have moved into the stone age
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:23:26 What
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:23:27 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:24:12 Well how would you not expect us to think that?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:24:31 It LITERALLY SAYS "What's new?: Text"
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:25:28 Damn
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:25:46 I was hoping that we wouldn't have to use hyroglyphics to communicate anymore
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:26:22 Hello
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:27:09 No my friend already makes gfx
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:27:17 So I'm gud
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:27:44 He made some covers for a couple of front page games
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 15:27:49 So he's at least decent
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:00:29 Xpert
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:00:34 Check dms
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:00:36 Plox
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:00:49 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:01:32 Could I get inventor role for it too? :D
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:02:29 It's unique
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:02:31 Ish
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:02:49 Damn
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:02:58 Aight I'll make a warp rammer
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:10:23 I wonder who else has the supersonic engineer role
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:16:49 Hell yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:28:39 I tri to cri but a guy named sai is being a bad guy and he told me a lie that rye can say bye
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:29:05 Dr. Seuss 💯
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:39:51 Rick and Morty sucks
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:39:59 Oh wait the dev guy
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:02 Yeah the dev is good
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:29 An invalid opinion because I have never watched Rick and mortt
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:31 Morty
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:39 Mortt
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:40:44 His name is mortt
help 2018-10-31 16:49:49 Gotta get that precision
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:58:18 Rork and micky
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 16:59:56 I wonder if Delta wings would actually help with high-speed planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:00:42 Wait things have strengths?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:00:48 Oh you mean lift
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:05:53 There should be another rank for making a rammer that can ram at 2000 speed
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:06:23 Because I would get it almost immediately
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:07:15 I should convert my suspension cannon into a hammer
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:07:27 Would be a lot more effective than the projectile it fires
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:07:58 Even though the projectile it fires managed to not only flip, but completely destroy an oof rammer
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:08:31 A hammer version would make it far, far worse
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:08:34 Better*
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:09:45 There should be heavier blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:09:49 Like lead blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:09:55 For increased damage
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:10:18 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 17:16:04 W
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:45:16 No, plot sizes in general are hard coded
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:45:29 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:46:54 How many blocks does a fully weighted balast weigh?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:46:58 2?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:49:53 Me
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:50:05 But not the vegetable
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:50:26 Glider
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:50:30 Parachute
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:53:27 When does the non-laggy magnet update come out?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:53:40 Aight like tomorrow?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:53:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:54:17 And the next update should be **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:56:15 Next update will remove diamonds because they're useless
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:58:34 How heavy is a ballast irl?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:59:45 Aight so ballast would be heavier than gold
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 19:00:05 How about **neutronium**
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 19:00:48 Or even heavier
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 19:00:52 My grades
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:33:37 It doesn't have the cylindrical things on the side, therefore, nein
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:43:43 There aren't cylindrical things on the side of the wheels
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:43:49 So add them
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:04:52 I made a multi-shot railgun
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:05:16 Only problem is magnets are strange
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:05:34 70% of the time it goes kinda fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:05:52 25% of the time it goes hella fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:06:30 And then 5% of the time it goes so fast you can only see it for 2 seconds before Roblox doesn't render it anymore
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:40:30 Oh damn
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 20:40:38 A guy at my school is in a full Master Chief costume.
general 2018-10-31 21:24:33 Why spend a bunch of money on an iPhone xs when you could just simulate it on a PC?
general 2018-10-31 21:24:35 Smh
general 2018-10-31 21:25:04 Ronblock
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:27:27 Fun fact: star wars was invented back in 1732 by star d. Warrens
bug-reports 2018-10-31 21:28:13 Try turning your computer off and on
bug-reports 2018-10-31 21:28:26 Yes it will
bug-reports 2018-10-31 21:28:29 It always works
bug-reports 2018-10-31 21:28:37 It will
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:40:00 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:40:26 Buuut logic Gates would be cooler
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:43:40 Ripp
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:44:08 Ah, a fellow procrastinator I see
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:31:10 OOOOOF
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:31:16 I made a warp rammer
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:31:27 and i warp rammed a guy who was copying my build
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:31:32 he had a TON of springs
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:31:38 and i THINK i just killed the server
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:08 i was fine with him copying
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:14 but i just wanted to warp ram it to see what would happen
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:21 and yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:22 it
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:25 died
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:32:44 dont worry, the server survived
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:42:01 uuuhhh
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:42:09 i just joined a server that has like
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:42:14 8 spanish speakers
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:43:44 same thing except portuguese is just a bit more western
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:09 muting who
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:10 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:40 eh
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:42 yeet it
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:46 give him full ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:54 go big or go home
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:56 amirite?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:10:08 heck
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:10:10 do whatever you can
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:15:08 aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:20:54 i have created the ultimate ramming machine
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:20:59 i am the king of kinetic
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:21:05 bow down peasants or i will ram your mom
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:47:22 i will ram your quantum mechanics
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:32:22 Human
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:32:38 With what
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:33:08 Boi dont be sassy with me
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:33:25 I invented a warp rammer and I will use it to ram your mom
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:33:50 Somewhere in america
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:34:04 I'll just ram all the middle aged women until I find her
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:34:17 Yeah that's what they all say
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:34:25 America is a place for all to live
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:34:54 Alright fine, I'll ram the entire planet until I get your mom
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:35:09 Including America in case you're finna bamboozle me
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:35:22 Let's see my warp rammer can go the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:35:46 The average distance between females is about 5 meters or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:35:48 So
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:36:02 A while but that's why I have sheriff tyrone
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:36:59 Telling you not to sass at me
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:52:40 Studs per second
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:54:18 No its what you get if you cut your leg in half
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:54:31 Roblox leg*
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 14:56:51 Some guy made an MLRS and watching it fired felt like you were watching an actual MLRS firing
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:05:38 Why are there a bunch of midgets in the hall holding their hand out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:06:03 Are they trying to hitchhike on someones shoulders or something?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:06:20 Oh wait they're elementary school kids
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:06:36 Why are they at a high school?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:08:17 And they're getting high fives
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:08:20 Aight then
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:12:31 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:12:39 Really short people*
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:13:33 Hugs
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:13:57 Help
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:14:04 Ye no homo
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:14:47 
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:15:04 It's a suspension cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:15:20 But it's kinda weak, so I'm making an improved version
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:15:27 Idk if I have a picture of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:15:43 But it went 6800 sps and was controlable
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:15:56 Hence why i have the supersonic engineer role
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:16:09 It was, but I could have made it bigger
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:16:43 Is a secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:16:45 Me no tell
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:00 But I used it to make a warp rammer
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:05 And lemme tell you
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:08 Nothing survives
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:17 Not even the warp rammer
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:20 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:17:57 It uses a warp drive to push extremely heavy weights to extreme speeds and Rams into creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:18:19 If the creation that it Rams has springs, it ceases to exist
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:18:26 Not a block
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:18:31 A configuration
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:18:54 Yeah that's the secret part
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:19:16 No it's a secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:19:32 Nope, it's a trade secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:19:37 Sorry kiddo
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:19:59 Yes, I pay myself to warp ram people
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:21:12 I prefer to discover the secrets myself
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:22:21 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:22:24 Not reallt
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:22:28 Really*
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:22:56 Eeee fine, I'll tell you one part
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:22:58 Pistons
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:37:00 Fat
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:40:58 I'm not a professional in dock crapping, so I'm afraid I can't answer that
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:41:26 Sounds painful though
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:41:32 Is it like kidney stones?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:15:36 Same
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:15:43 Like my Titan cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:16:23 They can also put guns on their creation and shoot open the box to see what's inside
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:33:07 I'm going to make a net shooter to take down Rick's helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:33:23 Ello
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:16:55 I should get inventor rank for making a supersonic warp plane
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:17:01 I was the first to make one
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:17:53 Nope
creations-chat 2018-11-01 20:40:30 A magnum vtol for my magnum dong
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:33 thats a secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:03:31 hey rick, just curious, but are you planning on adding a feature that allows the player to set the settings of an object before they place it down?
general 2018-11-02 02:39:49 i have a question
general 2018-11-02 02:40:02 
general 2018-11-02 02:40:23 why is my recommended tab like this
general 2018-11-02 04:19:15 you dont need a tail in real life either
general 2018-11-02 04:19:21 -cough b2 bomber-
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:30:58 The atmosphere is smelling clean
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:31:06 A storm is coming
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:31:10 Hell yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:34:12 Cloudy
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:34:16 Usually rainy
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:36:01 Hopefully thundery
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:36:18 And how do you not know what storm smells like?
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:36:26 Do you live in Texas or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:37:00 Eh
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:37:08 Well it smells clean and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:37:44 Because the oxygen stars having threesomes and makes o3, aka ozone
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:37:50 And ozone smells hella nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:38:48 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:39:12 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:39:28 Ozone is in the sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:39:33 Planes fly in the sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:39:38 So it works
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:41:23 Oh so you're chinese
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:41:27 Gotcha
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:42:51 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:54:25 I hope Rick adds my suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:54:29 It should be easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:54:56 A settings menu for setting the block's properties BEFORE placing it down so you don't have to copy paste
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:56:14 Have you ever heard the audio glitch where it sounds like someone saying "bleholbeliglbelglbeblo"
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 14:56:21 Is gr8
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 15:05:25 I wish I was thicc so my pants would stay up on their own
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 16:31:51 Rick I'm just curious, when do you think you will be able to add my suggestion?
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 16:41:34 That's called a wedge
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 16:42:54 Oh, a piece made out of only triangles
general 2018-11-02 17:12:56 Yeah
general 2018-11-02 17:13:21 I can't help but notice that this game is very popular with people who speak a foreign language
general 2018-11-02 17:14:07 It made me realize that terms like "lol" and "tags" are universal terms
general 2018-11-02 17:14:20 Like, what do they think "lol" stands for?
general 2018-11-02 17:14:39 Do they use it the same way we say "Mama Mia" in occasion?
general 2018-11-02 17:14:56 Or do they translate the acronyms
general 2018-11-02 17:15:13 Like in Spanish lol would mean "laughos outos loudos"
general 2018-11-02 17:15:20 I dunno
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 19:13:52 That one
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 19:35:35 I cant
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 19:35:56 And besides, I haven't made my net launcher yet to take down your heli
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 19:59:45 I'm at the school library waiting to get my flu shot
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:00:23 I know
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:00:28 That that is a lie
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:00:44 Obviously
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:01:16 Because you see all the parents who vaccinated their kids having their kids have autism
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:01:34 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:12:37 Alright got my shot
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:12:46 Yeah, it wasn't bad at all
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:12:59 Like a kitten bit you except not as painful
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:13:20 What is?
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:15:22 No I just didn't scroll up
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:21:32 an*
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:29:08 Why doesn't Rick have the warp drive role?
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 20:29:13 Does he know how?
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:10:24 ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:10:42 sorry kiddo, trade secret of mine
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:11:46 kinda confusedd
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:11:51 buuut aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:12:05 -3-
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:12:11 ear non consent me
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:12:39 i did
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:22 despacito
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:23 of course
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:30 oh wai thats not despacito
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:34 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:13:35 aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:16:07 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:16:15 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 03:16:19 but sounded neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 07:03:23 welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 07:03:28 i just tested my warp plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 07:03:54 i crashed into a spinning thing, and my screen froze and even though i exited out of roblox i still hear the engine of the thing i crashed into
general 2018-11-05 05:51:00 leaf people be like
general 2018-11-05 05:51:02 
general 2018-11-05 05:52:57 yes
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:19 whut
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:25 why did some nerd tell me to come here
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:06 oh
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:12 well that sounds kinda dumb
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:17 considering we have magnets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:20 but aight
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:33 hecks no
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:03:36 i like the magnets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:04:17 the magnets as they are arent complicated
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:04:21 so no point, really
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 16:05:41 I want a longer build zone so I can make my Titan cannon longer
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:17:23 Looks good to me
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:17:32 Except the light mode part
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:17:35 That part ruins it
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:17:39 Brings it down to about
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:17:45 3 upvotes including yours
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:21:27 NOW it's dark mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:21:28 Good
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:37:47 Is a secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:37:50 Big secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:38:34 No, the way to use magnets to make a plane move
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:38:39 That's the secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:39:32 O damn, fellas I haven't even been born yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:40:54 Deloras?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:41:08 Dolores?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:41:20 Yeah delorean
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:41:33 Back to the me
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:50:41 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:50:55 My phone spazzed out and sent a nerd a friend request
creations-chat 2018-11-05 17:55:16 Would I be able to get creator rank for making a supersonic airplane?
the-dump 2018-11-05 17:59:23 Yup that's a fern alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 18:08:03 A stud is a foot
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 18:08:18 That's why roblockians are 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 18:08:23 Should be 6 but eh
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 19:45:49 4/20/2020
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:42:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kw2MNBLidU
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:42:25 Is this what plane crazy is based on
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:34:13 This guy in another discord has a 120 mm artillery she'll next to his bed
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:41:22 I'm going to try to make a supersonic plane that doesn't wobble when it goes too fast, and I watched a rocket science presentation that will help me do that
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:41:41 Will be good
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:34:58 wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:38:34 He died to death
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:45:04 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:45:24 If it's on the internet, it's a dude until proven otherwise
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:45:29 That's my philosophy
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:46:45 <@217336009455566848> when is the anti-magnet lag update coming out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:48:21 K pls work quicc, my supersonic airplane is starting to get close to the sound barrier, but the lag makes it look really slow
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:48:25 Yay :D
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:48:53 It's gonna be the best supersonic plane ever made
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:49:02 Maneuverability is gonna be hot and a half
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:49:25 Well maybe
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:49:49 I haven't met a fellow supersonic engineer, so I dunno if anyone has made anything better
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:50:48 Lock function?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:50:51 What dat
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:53:47 But not maneuverable
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:53:55 And you probably did something illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:54:01 Like heloim block
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:54:02 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:54:03 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:55:28 But ye I'm building a new supersonic plane because I feel like the let one I built was kinda cheap, because it couldn't maneuver when it got to those speeds. But THIS one
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:55:31 This one is gonna be good
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:55:48 Just you wait until the anti lag update
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 15:58:08 Just curious, do parts attached to suspension count as loose parts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 16:08:41 
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:02:22 Hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:02:34 I wanna make an aircraft carrier with a catapault
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:02:37 I cant
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:02:43 School made roblox illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:02:51 So I'll join in 5 hours
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:03:36 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:03:46 Move to America then
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:03:51 Noob
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:04:08 Americano
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:04:18 Oh wait you're those nerds in the middle of america
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:04:25 I thought you meant pm
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:05:58 Remember the game update that added text?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:06:01 11/10
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:06:48 Rick, are you going to add the ui that allows people to set the settings of blocks before they place them down?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:06:57 Would be nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:07:06 Especially for my suspension cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:07:50 Because I don't want to copy paste thousands of times for the hundreds of suspension and pistons required
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:08:27 Eventually I'm going to build a cannon that will fire entire planets
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:09:08 But ye, I'm starting small first
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:09:34 I'm starting with only firing massive bolts of full density ballasts
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:09:37 Wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:09:54 Look at my pfp
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:09:57 Remove the hair
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:01 Make he skin yellow
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:05 Remove he scarf
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:08 Take off the shirt
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:13 Give it chest hair
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:21 Put a fidget spinner as pants
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:24 Give big muscles
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:26 Tah dah
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:31 You got my character
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:10:56 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:11:37 But yeah, Rick, are you going to add the UI that allows people to set the settings of blocks before they place them down, or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:12:04 When I suggested it, it got 15 thumbs
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:12:07 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:12:09 K thancc
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:13:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:13:46 The missiles shall make the main game much more interesting
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:13:57 Unless you're going to make it client side, like guns -3-
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 17:14:21 But I guess it would be a good thing
general 2018-11-06 17:17:59 
general 2018-11-06 17:18:05 Leaves doing leaf things
the-dump 2018-11-06 17:18:44 
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:00:55 I just finished making a commercial for entrepreneurship class
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:01:18 Our slogan is "if you have the munchies, have a bowl of crunchies"
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:01:25 Definitely next bill gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:01:27 11/10
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:04:32 Go get the die
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:09:20 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:09:33 It's spreading enlightenment
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:15:15 You mean the valcyry?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:15:19 Or whatever it's called
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:15:26 It's a helicopter plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 18:15:30 Look it up
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 19:45:59 Rick man, check suggestions, less laggy version of suspension idea and how to make them less laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:12:39 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:12:58 I thought you were in vacayion
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:13:00 Why u here
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:13:13 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:13:21 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:16:30 Hopefully Rick adds my idea soon. He liked it, and it would be really easy to add, just add a prismatic constraint to the suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:45:02 For thancc giving, me and the leaf gang will give thancc to the meatatarians by deep frying a turducken, making another turducken and wrapping in bacon, and then a porkey/hamey
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 20:45:13 Maybe throw in an ostrich and make a turduckenrich
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 21:38:39 Rick is short for richael
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 21:39:59 Richael was about to talk but he decided that it's not worth it
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 21:41:16 Rick is a euphemism for 
Rick
is
Not
Cool
or
Kind
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 21:41:21 Heck gotta go
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:46:37 <:thonking:509498568982134816>

plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:47:30 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:48:33 
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:50:18 Richael, do you think my suspension idea could be added quickly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:50:24 Should be easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:50:38 Just add a prismatic constraint to it and tah dah
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:21:31 I spy with my little eye a god damn anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:22:06 I also spy with my little eye an annoying auto correct
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:31:37 Why do you nerds fly when you can build cooler stuff on the ground
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:31:42 Like suspension cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:32:19 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:33:52 I just saw my little character in the bottom left and it puts it into perspective
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:33:54 Dang
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:34:53 I can't wait for richael to make the suspension less laggy, and to let us put preset settings so I can make an upgraded version
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:35:01 It's shall be able to fire houses
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:35:04 Just you see
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:36:17 -fires house at homeless person-
**"IM GENEROUS!!!"**
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:38:06 But ye when richael adds those things, my cannons are going to be danker than ever before
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:39:20 My current cannon can fire big things, yes, but when the projectiles hit things they only boop them a few meters. Besides, they don't have much range on them, and people can just get out of the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:39:45 Once the updates are out
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:39:49 Nobody will be safe
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:40:13 Rammers meant to not be movable will get flung farther than ever before
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:40:16 Just you see
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:41:23 Yeah, it won't be able to go in the air, but anything in the ocean or on the ground are going to die to death
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:42:09 Just
-titan cannon fires-
"Wait wha"
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:42:15 Dead
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:42:26 It shall be glorious
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:44:08 Hecks no, I cant even do it with a decently structured plane, I have to design a special design of warp drive and make the plane really light
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:44:33 The plane that I used to get the role without the warp drive is only about 12 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:46:04 I hope we get logic Gates and stuff soon so that the bolts that my cannon fires- can be automatically aimed at targets
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:46:16 Because rn, it's really hard to aim the current design
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:46:43 In actual combat it might work for battleships and big stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:46:47 But that's about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:47:51 But when it's in the normal game, it's fun to drive up to unsuspecting big things and boop them off the map
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:48:08 Idk how they don't notice something this big slowly creeping up on them
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:48:24 Maybe they don't realize it's a cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:49:01 Yeah, a lot of people try to copy my design
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:51:22 I tried using suspension as a dampener for the recoil, but it's too strong and it just pushes it back all the way and then it's pretty much not dampening
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:51:35 Me
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:51:47 Send me the link and I'll be there in 6 hours
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:51:50 Oh rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:53:08 I volunteer this guy as replacement tester ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:53:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:53:30 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:53:31 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:53:55 Aight this guy works
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:54:21 Replicator at best
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:54:32 Or communist
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:54:44 Well yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:54:47 It's russian
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:54:54 They haven't invented runways yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 15:55:52 What are they?
the-dump 2018-11-07 15:56:58 
the-dump 2018-11-07 15:57:20 He's one of the leaves in my leaf group
the-dump 2018-11-07 15:57:23 He is good leaf
the-dump 2018-11-07 15:57:28 Does a good glucose
the-dump 2018-11-07 16:00:33 Oh come on
the-dump 2018-11-07 16:00:46 We all know donkey Kong is best
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:06:50 You peasants
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:06:56 Make warp propellers
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:07:01 Best propellers
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:07:10 They send you somewhere
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:07:15 I have yet to figure out ehere
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:07:20 But aomewhere
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:08:54 My new design for my supersonic plane works fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:09:01 Only problem is *lag*
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:09:09 It doesn't go super Sonic quite yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 16:09:16 But it gets up to 2200
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:00:06 If Easter eggs are rare, then why are they so easy to find at egg hunts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:00:53 Get disproven
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:00:54 B)
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:02 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:07 Exploit it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:13 Exploit the glitch for benefit
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:22 That's what you do when you find a glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:39 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:03:42 Lame
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:04:47 I did a thing and I saw my creation move when I didn't detatch the thing, so I refined it and eventually it moved so much that when I put wings on it, it went faster than the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:04:50 Next step:
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:04:53 Light apeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:04:55 Speed*
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:05:57 They didn't intend for it to happen
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:06:16 That's like saying creepers aren't glitched pigs
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:06:18 Tru
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:16:49 Wtf
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:17:08 I must make it better
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:17:17 I shall make it fling you to the moon
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:19:35 I shall incorporate warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:19:45 Everybody dkes
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:19:46 Dies
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:27:59 I was building a net launcher to take down helis, but I haven't been able to make a good launching thing for it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:28:06 But I'm still working on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:29:02 If I manage to get it launching well, helis will die to death
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:33:10 Making a net launcher is harder than you would thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:33:12 Think
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:33:20 The net needs to spin to keep it open
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:33:32 And also it needs to go far
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:33:43 So I'mma make a catapault
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:34:08 That's what they all say
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:34:23 If it's on the internet, it's a dude until proven otherwise
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:35:41 Nope I'm at school
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:41:18 Richael is online
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:42:22 Well show us a video or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:42:35 Oh god
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:42:54 The person who made the AA gun has an anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 17:43:02 Expectations: **low**

plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:06:05 Rick
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:06:08 Suspense
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:27 I mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:33 The suspension thing wouldn't be hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:37 Just a constraint
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:40 Prismatic
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:42 Tah dah
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:10:44 Done did
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:28:02 Also
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:28:09 Wait nvm
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:44:07 My entire American literature class is trying to figure out if corn is a fruit, vegetable, or grain
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:44:13 Wikipedia says it's all 3
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:44:22 Sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:48:13 Fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:48:29 Richael is long for richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:49:14 And Richard should add toasters to the game

plane-crazy 2018-11-07 22:46:03 His name is richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:02:48 i fixed my problem where my warp drive dies, so now im ready to make it even stronger
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:02:55 it shall be a good warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:03:06 best super sonic airplane you nerds will ever see
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:04:24 i got it like 2 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:04:26 so hah
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:04:51 (X) to doubt
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:04:58 X
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:05:15 and i doubt you were
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:05:34 but not that it really matters
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 23:05:54 because the wright brothers didnt create the F15 Fighting Falcon

creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:23:19 fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:48:39 i have a question
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:48:56 how do you keep the fastest spinning thing possible in one place?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:50:54 https://gyazo.com/d2f9b011da5b40fd6a7a365cbe0e3ad1
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:51:08 this kind of spinning
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:58:36 alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:58:42 i tamed the forbidden fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:58:48 now to make it into a weapon
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:44:26 plane? vtol? take off and fly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:44:31 tf is that guy doing lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:44:57 its all about that land equipment
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 06:14:23 observe, children
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 06:14:26 
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 06:14:30 the forbidden fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 06:41:20 that wont work with the upgraded version
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 06:43:39 but the upgraded version takes time to charge up
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 15:29:31 Noob

plane-crazy 2018-11-08 15:52:59 Fun fact: trees communicate with each other using fungi on their roots, and they give nutrients to trees in need and their children.
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 15:53:05 Vegans re murderers
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 15:53:33 Oh jesus
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 15:55:27 I had an exploit engine until the creator found out I was using it to make anti-exploits and he blacklisted my key
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:04:49 Way under
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:06:04 I'll give you the equation
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:06:17 Setting 4 pushes 3 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:06:30 So 4/3
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:06:38 Find out what that is and maybe it works
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:09:09 <#501059272675688468>
the-dump 2018-11-08 16:12:35 No it's genome passing
general 2018-11-08 16:15:37 
creations-chat 2018-11-08 16:16:38 What
creations-chat 2018-11-08 16:17:02 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:40:19 I can tell your right now, that number is very, very incorrect
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:40:43 Still
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:40:49 Very, VERY incorrect
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:44:04 384021699466756103/7,400,000,000 = 51,894,824. So if everyone in the world made a channel every second, it would take 1.64 years to get that many channels. And that's without sleep or eating breaks
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:47:53 Richard, since the mods aren't looking, can you check out my creation and see if it's good enough for inventor role?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:49:48 I had to add port and starboard attachments to make my thing 500 blocc so I could get inventor role
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:50:28 That's because the center of lift keeps pushing the nose down
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:50:33 Move it forward a bit
creations-chat 2018-11-08 16:51:29 <@456226577798135808> could you check out my dern creation please
creations-chat 2018-11-08 16:51:56 Yay thancc
creations-chat 2018-11-08 16:52:42 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:52:48 Ayyy
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:53:03 Non sense
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:53:11 That's how you make a supersonic airplane
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:53:29 But he doesn't know aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:53:46 So it probably wobbles and dies because the center of pressure is too far behind
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:54:54 But it's better than in front
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:57:53 I can't wait until the update for less laggy magnets, then my supersonic airplanes will be 11 times better
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:57:56 Wot m8
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:00:07 I'm currently in the process of making a weaponized fidget spinner of eternal death and suffering, and it's coming along great
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:00:29 It's basically an air defense thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:00:42 If nerds try to steal me with the a seat
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:01:17 It gets tangled in the fidget spinner of death, they get sucked down, and they die one of the worst deaths possible
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:01:57 Nyce
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:02:24 I'm going to add stronger warp drives to my weaponized fidget spinner so that it gains speed quicker
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:02:53 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:04:08 But ye, mine just spins, and it stretches springs out for a larger death zone
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:04:54 Willing to bet that when it gets up to full speed, anything that touches the counter weights on the ends of the springs immediately die
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:09:55 Idk how fast the counter weights at the end of my weaponized fidget spinner go, but it's safe to say it's at least 2000 sps
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:10:23 Are you asking ME how?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:10:26 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:10:31 Magic tricc
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:11:07 Maybe I should add propeller blades to my weaponized fidget spinner and see what happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:11:33 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:11:47 -cough-
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:11:49 I did
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:11:52 I managed
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:12:08 Not Mach 3 but I have an idea on how
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:12:15 It's all about center of pressure
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:14:13 Go on what
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:14:35 Can't, Im at school
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:17:17 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:17:26 It's called a phone btw
the-dump 2018-11-08 17:41:46 How tf are blind people supposed to read that
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:43:39 Happiness
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:44:37 No that's illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:45:31 No those are useless
the-dump 2018-11-08 17:48:56 What is that I'm at school so I can't see
the-dump 2018-11-08 17:49:27 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:50:49 I'm working in anti air fidget spinners
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:52:12 If an airplane touches the counterweight at the end of the spinners, they get flung into Oblivion, if someone tries to steal me using a chair, it gets tangled up in the spinner and the plane gets sucked down to the most horrifying and painful ending you can get
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:53:18 So yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:53:27 Don't mess with the forbidden fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:54:18 I should add a counter-torque fidget spinner on the bottom so that if something gets stuck in the middle of the rope of the main fidget spinner, they get hit by the counter spinner and die
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:54:28 I can't make it dab
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:54:55 But I can tell you rn, anybody using planes to try to get into my space are legally required to die
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:55:12 And the fidget spinner is the legal enforcer
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:55:27 Now to make a version for ground things
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:57:07 This was an early prototype, the more modern version stays on the ground and has counterweights that will completely destroy anything it touches https://gyazo.com/d2f9b011da5b40fd6a7a365cbe0e3ad1
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 18:00:13 What the fuck am I doing
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 19:14:43 Updat
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 19:14:47 Nao
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:01 Is the lag-resistant suspension in there? :D
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:25 And is the GUI that let's you pre-set settings in there? :D
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:26 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:28 Dang
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:30 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:32 Magnots
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:02:52 Well, that's nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:03:10 But I still have to click a billion times, but I'm glad it's faster now
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:03:13 I'll be patient
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:04:42 Though I do think that lag-resistant suspension would be a quick add, it's just a prismatic constraint but oh well
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:06:41 And lag resistant magnats is neat too
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:06:59 My weaponized fidget spinner shall spin faster than ever before

plane-crazy 2018-11-08 21:42:33 Uhhh how tf would I know
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:34:28 Now for lag-resistant suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:35:39 Update should be neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:35:42 Idk tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:35:45 I'm not home
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:35:46 So
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:36:29 Child
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:36:38 I built a fidget spinner of death
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:36:53 It incorporates warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:36:57 And lemme tell you
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:37:10 You don't want to test the fidget spinner of death
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:37:24 Kiddo
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:37:34 I built a netaincher
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:37:38 Net launcher
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:38:01 Helicopters are longer safe
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:38:13 No*
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:41:11 I spy with my little eye an anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:41:43 Ur mom
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:44:48 Oof
the-dump 2018-11-08 22:47:07 
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:03:43 magnets arent not laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:04:22 boi
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:04:26 they're laggier than before
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:09:48 well
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:10:00 i figured out that it was the motor that was causing the lag
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:10:05 now its gud
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:10:10 how do you know?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:54:53 oh jesus
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:55:09 i built a fidget spinner so fast that it starts vibrating and it just
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:55:16 YEETS out of existance
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:59:37 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:59:38 i made
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:59:48 the most amazing fidget spinner in existance
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:00:13 it spins SO FAST that it starts to vibrate, it rises into the air, then it starts distorting and then it goes... somewhere
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:40:42 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:40:43 my
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:40:44 god
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:40:58 my forbidden fidget spinner goes interdimentional
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:41:06 but thats not the oh my god part
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:41:30 when it does, there is a radius around it where the larger you are, the more likely you are to get destroyed
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:41:37 cant, it only happens for a frame
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:42:20 child you dont understand the forbidden fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:43:03 oh wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:43:05 you're in my game
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 03:43:06 rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:36:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:36:40 take a look at who touched him
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:36:41 in the chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:41:31 we're testing out my interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:44:30 im worried that when i add stronger warp drives to this thing its going to fully kill the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:44:37 right now it only partially kills it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 06:46:26 i will, when i add them tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:32:29 When I get home I'm going to ass stronger warp drives to my interdimentional fidget apinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:32:44 Just to see what happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:33:42 Aight but idk why you would need a pickaxe, this isn't mein kramph
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:33:47 Mine craft*
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:34:45 What
creations-chat 2018-11-09 15:44:26 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:47:01 A little bit more laggy tbh, at least on startup
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:47:16 fortshit
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:47:18 Yea
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:47:45 Boi just put like 9 magnets somewhere and you will see what we mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:48:07 I use magnets to power my interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:48:09 So yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:48:13 I need like 80
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:49:10 On start up it freezes for a few seconds though
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:49:17 It didn't do that before
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:49:55 I didn't test that because I always jump out of the seat and back in to make the lag go away
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:50:01 So I'll test that when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:51:15 But yeah, my interdimentional fidget spinner managed to fling an aircraft carrier at Mach 2 when it went interdimentional
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:51:37 It's the dankest weapon ever created
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:51:45 I just need to make it more likely to hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:52:13 Yeah definitely
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:52:28 I'm willing to bet that if it hits it just right, it can take out anyhing
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:52:49 It's 149 blocc
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:53:03 But a couple springs
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:53:07 Yay thancc
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:53:29 Accurate
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:53:53 I hope I'm able to control the fidget spinner when it goes interdimentional
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:54:08 Imagine building a reliable cannon out of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:54:16 Anything would die
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:56:40 See wot I mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:56:44 Big man's don't lie
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:57:55 Because my interdimentional fidget spinner needs like 80 ballast blocks to keep it stable while its spinning up
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:58:09 And an anchored block would be nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:58:30 Do it richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:58:34 He doesn't understand
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:59:07 What does it do right now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:59:23 You can still do that
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 15:59:36 But changing it would make it so that motors still spin things
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:00:02 Fonkl read wot I said
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:01:15 It anchors itself and that means any blocks it's touching can't move, but motors can still turn
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:03:21 Yeah but when he changes the anchor, it will make it possible to build massive air bases with spinning propellers and turrets and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:03:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:07:29 My got dam underwear is too big for me and now it's up halfway up my body and it feels weird
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:07:31 Hec
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:08:03 Excuse me does it look like I have a sense of public decency
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:08:25 Disable lose parts only?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:08:28 What
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:08:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:09:12 Alright, idk how letting it act on more blocks would make it less laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:09:14 But aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:09:54 Can't wait for the lag-resistant suspension, because it will also make my interdimentional fidget spinner more stable until I want it to warp
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 16:10:22 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:09:57 Fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:10:00 Uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:10:14 Trees eat atmosphere
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:13:27 Next contest should be most dangerous creation possible
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:14:20 I would win by default because my interdimentional fidget spinner, if it hits it right, can fling anything at any speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:15:07 Fastest so far is Mach 2 when some guy ran an aircraft carrier into it when it started warping
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:15:15 But I'm trying to make it controlled
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:15:48 I'm improving it to make it so
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:16:25 But my fidget spinner's magnet engines aren't big enough, so I'm making them bigger
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:16:37 Yeah well you need to get good to get super sonic
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:16:40 B)
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:16:53 That is forbidden knowledge
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:17:04 Due to the fact that it is possible to kill servers with them
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:17:20 My interdimentional fidget spinner gets close to killing the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:17:29 But it isn't strong enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:17:30 Yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:21:17 Once the lag-resistant suspension is added my interdimentional fidget spinner will be even more deadly
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:21:50 Maybe I will even be able to control it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:21:57 If I do, everybody dies
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:24:38 In fact, now that I understand how the interdimentional fidget spinner works, maybe I will be able to miniaturize it and make it aimable
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:25:35 Yeah just scroll up to yesterday at around 10:30 pm PST
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:25:54 Cant
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:27:14 That's the prototype
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:27:28 I improved it with bigger engines and a weight on the bottom
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:28:18 Now it speeds up and it starts shaking, then it starts levitating and then it distorts and poofs out of existence, sometimes taking other people's creations with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:28:38 Now I just need to make it controllable
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:28:53 And then I will have the dankest cannon ever created
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:36:14 Sooky scay seltons
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:36:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:36:47 What was the update?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:37:05 Wot was it? >:/
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:37:15 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:37:46 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:38:07 Wait another one or the same one as yesterday?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:38:19 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:38:26 First FEW seconds
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:38:53 Also, Richard, waddya thincc about my suggestion?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:39:17 The most recent one
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:41:25 Also, you can make the blocks named something, and the magnet checks what name it has, if it says "loose" then it effects it, if not, it ignores it and moves onto the next one
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:41:41 Should make it 69x quicker
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:41:44 I thincc
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:43:18 How do the magnets check which blocks are loose and which aren't?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:43:40 Explain plox
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:43:48 Like what does the function do
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:44:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:47:05 Well in build mode, the magnet can see what it's connected to, name it "connected", then whenever a new block is added, check what the block is connected to. If it's connected to "connected", then it names itself "connected", and if it's also connected to a not-connected then that not connected gets named "connected", and then it doesn't that for that block as well, and tah dah
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:47:25 It's programmy stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:47:35 Except without the programmy stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:48:05 Tf is pseudo code
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:48:29 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:48:47 Oh aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:48:52 Understood 100
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:59:50 These people posting speeds that were achieved using helium blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 17:59:53 Peasants
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:00:59 Yeah but you cant get the rank from helium blocka
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:01:02 Blocks*
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:01:16 Wait dafuq
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:01:33 Which one of you peasants gave the lighspeed role for a helium block creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:02:27 Well he's bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:03:12 Make rockets except nuclear flavored
general 2018-11-09 18:05:15 
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:09:54 Richard, tell your peasant of an admin director to stop giving these nerds light speed role for helium block creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:10:05 Or whatever his rank is called
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:10:14 Oh it's just admin
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:10:28 Oh he's server owner
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:10:29 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:10:33 My 🅱
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:14:37 Richard check my suggestion plox is good one and is needed rn because of all these peasants getting it for basically free
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:07:55 (X) to doubt
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:07:56 X
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:08:25 Oh magnets
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:08:28 That makes sense
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:09:01 I cant
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:09:13 It's illegal to music at scho
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:09:15 School
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:10:15 Richard when is lag resistant suspense? >:(
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 19:10:43 How many days are in a soon
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:40:43 Richard how many days is soon when lag-resistant suspense is in context? <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:41:13 The definition of hinge is motor with powered disabled
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:41:43 The laggy part of suspension is it moving up and down and left and right when its in long lines
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:41:52 And a prismatic constraint would stahp that
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:42:43 So much in fact that you said motor instead of constraint/suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:21:05 I should make a caterpillar tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:21:15 You will see what I mean when I'm done
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:33:45 Fuck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:33:49 It's snowing
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:33:52 Why
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:34:06 Because you are have stupid
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:34:35 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:34:49 Because you are have lack intelligence*
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:36:37 Fuuuuuuck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:36:41 I hate snow
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:36:47 Why did we move here?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:36:51 It god damn sucks
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:37:09 Luckies
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:01:34 holy suck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:02:10 making the magnets affect any part made the interdimentional fidget spinner far less stable
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:07:45 uh oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:07:59 o thank god i thought my fidget spinner killed the server for a sec
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:12:48 holu suck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:12:55 holy suck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:13:16 my interdimentional fidget spinner can be used to warp me to over 8 billion sps
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:14:42 aight 🅱
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:17:59 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:18:08 roblox just shut down the server im in
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:18:18 right when i fired my experimental warp weapon
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:18:27 imagine if i caused that lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:19:49 delete yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:20:56 experimental warp cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 01:03:26 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:04:47 no, sorry, you cant get lightspeed for helium blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:04:55 presuming thats helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:05:20 aight prove it then
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 07:24:04 
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 07:36:03 every chat i touch dies
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:32:36 
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:32:38 god which one
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:09 no a is the answer for admins
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:15 its between c and d
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:33 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:38 i dont even want moderator
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:41 what am i doing lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:33:43 nvm
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:28:21 when that guy at the end of the road realizes that nobody has spammed rockets and magnets yet
general 2018-11-11 23:55:19 
the-dump 2018-11-12 04:42:51 wait what happened
the-dump 2018-11-12 04:43:04 where did it go
the-dump 2018-11-12 04:43:57 <@!252094891448860673> there are 2 possibilities, one is my image didnt send and i didnt notice or one of your mods are bad
the-dump 2018-11-12 04:49:40 iiima repost just to make sure it wasnt my 🅱
the-dump 2018-11-12 04:49:43 
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:06:56 happy birthday me
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:07:04 17 years of whatever the hell ive been doing
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:07:13 i've eaten so much cake
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:07:18 i feel like a lard
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:16:15 in-game AI?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:16:32 like, a thing that actually reacts in-game?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 06:17:02 sounds simple enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:38:31 Ello noobs
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:38:47 Send proof
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:39:01 Send proof*
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:39:30 Send proof or no believe
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:39:55 That's exactly why
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:40:02 Xpert big noob too
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:40:35 Thats also why
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:40:56 I don't have SpongeBob noodles so nah
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:43:50 I made a warp cannon and an interdimentional fidget spinner but I don't get a custom rank meanwhile this nerd makes some very, very basic ai and he gets a custom rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:43:51 Smh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:12 No I just call it a fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:23 Because it spins
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:30 So fast that it starts to levitate
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:47 Then it stretches and goes **somewhere**
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:56 And takes anything that's touching it with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:17 So I miniaturized it into a cannon and now noobs die on the daily
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:37 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:51 It's not a garunteed hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:57 But when it hita
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:59 Hits*
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:48:02 Rip anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:48:10 Even aircraft carriers and tanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:48:23 They just poof out of existance
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:48:36 Delete yourself nothing cand destroy the warp cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:06 Delete yourself before my warp cannon deltes you for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:13 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:23 Also you have anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:24 Smh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:49:37 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:52:58 Same thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:53:03 Go to account settings
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:53:28 Riiight
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:53:59 I shaved my face yesterday and now I feel smooth as heck
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:54:04 Baby face
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:54:17 Wall 🇪
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:54:29 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:54:45 He's trying to rotate a block
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:54:56 He can't figure out how to rotate the block
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:55:13 Yup
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:56:10 The quest to rotate the single block
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:56:49 Mazes are just as easy when blind as when not
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:56:54 Just hug the left wall
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:57:00 You will get to the end eventually
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:58:54 Peasants
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:06:01 Parachute 💯
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:07:03 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:07:06 Spam helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:07:16 That's how all of the speed of light people do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:08:13 Well they got it using helium a couple of days ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:08:21 Maybe they actually fixed it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:08:58 A bunch of people got it for spamming helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:09:18 But maybe they fixed it so people don't give light speed for helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:09:53 I can get light speed without it thogh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:10:13 Using my interdimentional fidget spinner, even aircraft carriers can go light speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:12:59 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:04 Big boy builder
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:12 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:17 I shall suggest that
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:15:46 I m gonna make a more reliable warp cannon
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:15:56 If I can make it hit 90% of the time
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:16:04 Then that would be beautiful
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:17:26 But first I need to figure out how the interdimentional fidget spinner decides to fire
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:25:42 Secret
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:29:29 If a stud was a meter then robloxian would be 5 meters tall and that would be terrifying
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:11 **FRICK**
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:55 I'm going to put a seat on my interdimentional fidget spinner and see how fast I go when it warps
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:38:32 Yeah at really far distances, the floats start to get too big for the server to handle, so it rounds up or down to make it simpler, so the farther away you are the more distorted your character becomes
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:39:12 Excuse me we aren't the same person
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:43 Traveling St lightspeed in real life will destroy the universe. If a single atom went at the speed of light, of it hit earth it would have enough energy to completely destroy earth and if it decayed leaving behind its kinetic energy it would cause an explosion with infinite energy, causing space time to melt into a soup, go all weird, and basically die
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:51:46 The fastest way up is dying
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:00 If you believe the Christian conspiracy theory that is
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:10 If not
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:12 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:20 A char
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:22 Chair*
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:33 Put some helium on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:39 Just as much helium as you can
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:48 And you will meet upwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:52:57 Or if you want to go the good route
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:53:11 You can use a warp drive, it rockets
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:53:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:53:55 The warp drive is a particular orientation of blocks, but that's forbidden technology because it can be used to make warp cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:55:05 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:16 Richards typing
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:23 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:26 Hecks no
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:31 They're already stupid
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:43 They lift so kuch
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:46 Much
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:56:59 Well duh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:57:13 It already is 4x the lifting power though
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:57:58 Nein
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:58:15 What we need is **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:58:41 Richard pls add logic Gates they would be so neat pls plox
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:59:11 And sensors because logic Gates without sensors is badd
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:59:20 He already said he's going to add them
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:59:23 In anwhole
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:59:31 In a while*
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:00:15 Yeahh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:00:19 But logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:00:26 Would be neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:00:50 And after the logic Gates are added he needs to add memory blocks that store a number
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:09:58 If you attach a single block with a motor to 10 full density ballast blocks with their weight canceled out with helium blocks, which will be spun more, the single block or the ballasts with helium? <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 18:15:19 Lmao rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:28:28 
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:28:46 1.18*e+15
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:29:46 118200000000000
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:29:50 thats how fast i went
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:29:51 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 23:29:59 tru xpert
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:42:06 the half blocks are off
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:42:09 but .1
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:42:11 and its
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:42:17 very annoying
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:45:05 yes well you're bad
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:45:40 darn wing panels
bug-reports 2018-11-14 03:45:46 nobody makes planes in this game anyways
bug-reports 2018-11-14 05:38:25 my reloadable rail gun is ruined by the offset, so hopefully it gets fixed as soon as possible
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:16 no
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:18 nonnononon
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:25 <@!217336009455566848> richard i change my mind
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:30 keep it as a sepparate block
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:43 the slight offset is hella nice for making cannon barrels
bug-reports 2018-11-14 06:35:48 imma put it in suggestions
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:40:15 Oi Richard if you're lurking check out suggestions because 10 people want the off set block to stay as a thing while adding back the normal slab
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:40:29 Pls off-set block is good
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:41:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:41:43 It's very useful for making tight-fitting areas for moving blocks through
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:41:48 Like cannon barrels
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:41:50 It's nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:41:54 And reloading stuffs
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:42:06 What
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:42:30 I will when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:43:00 But basically, you can slide things through places without them getting stuck every few blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:43:38 So you can build more compact cannons and slingshots
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:45:44 And probably non-weaponized creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:46:36 Whut
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:46:53 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:46:59 Wait what
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:03 Oh I have light speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:07 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:14 Build an interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:17 Put a seat on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:20 There you go
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:39 At least that's how I got it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:51 Just a spinny thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:47:56 But spin it really fast
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:48:16 I'm not going to tell you how I made it spin fast enough to pretend that blocks don't exist
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:48:22 Because that's forbidden technology
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:48:56 But if you figure it out, when it distorts, it's going to send you far, FAR faster than the speed of light
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:49:00 Ooh
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:49:02 :D
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:49:07 O hell yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:49:19 Time for a bigger interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:50:16 But ye Richard, the off set block is neat and it can't be used for bad stuff, unless you count cannons as bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:50:43 But the cannons aren't able to aim at things
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:51:04 Basically my cannons prey consists of cars and planes that go by
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:51:10 And usually I miss then
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:51:13 Them*
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:51:38 But yet off-set half blocks are 11/10
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:52:29 I wonder if Richard has made a lag-resistant suspension yet <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:52:51 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:52:57 That reminds me
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:53:22 Yesterday a group of girls stood in front of my weaponized interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:53:33 They stayed long enough for it to charge up
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:53:35 And yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:53:39 They got flung
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:54:04 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:54:42 I mean, the prismatic constraint being added to it would help
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:55:58 Considering the warp drive isn't considered a glitch, my interdimentional fidget spinner is glitch-free
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:58:24 And Richard, you don't have to get rid of the suspension constraint, but adding a prismatic constraint to it will make it so it can only squish and stretch, instead also go to the side
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:58:33 But I'll stop talking about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:59:01 Mainly because I just realized that adding the prismatic constraint will patch my interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:00:24 Patheric
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:00:50 I got to 1.18e+15 speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:00:54 Beat that
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:04 Aight neat Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:26 I know
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:59 1180000000000000
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:02:04 I'll beat it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:02:27 I doubt people will get there
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:02:39 But I constantly find faster and faster glitches
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:02:43 So I'll figure it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:04:22 How fast is light speed in roblock?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:05:00 Just looked in roles
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:17:42 Bombardier is so easy to get
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:18:02 There should be a rank for cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:00:20 Fun fact: you can win the weekly contest by building a car, as long as everyone votes for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:09:08 I'm building an improved reloadable railgun. The bullets still won't do much, but they kinda bonk things and if people get hit by then the get booped a bit of a distance
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:11:28 Roblox should invent better servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:13:26 His name is richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:13:30 Call him richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:13:39 Good
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:14:13 Rick is short for richael, and richael is a synonym for richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:14:34 Too bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:14:38 His name is richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:15:00 Yes richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:15:21 K
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:15:27 I didn't know that existed
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:16:54 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:17:30 Bumper cars
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:18:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:18:10 I have
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:18:20 Booper cars
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:19:06 Oh the link making it glide
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:19:14 Hover thingies
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:19:30 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:19:43 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:20:00 Idk how that would help me make cannons but alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:21:51 I made a net launcher and nobody has a helicopter for me to test it on
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:21:58 Besides, it isn't very accurate
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:22:04 Sadd is me
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:23:13 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:23:16 Call him richard

plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:14:39 It's all been taken over by OwOs and emojis so [: is a refreshing taste of the old days
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:15:22 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:15:30 Happi

plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:15:57 /e dab
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:17:45 Idk why website like 🅱ing get hacked, like 🅱 just turn on filtering enabled lmaoooo 😂👌
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:21 F
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:30 Good thing autosaves exist
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:35 They're really hard to find
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:38 But they exist
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:53 You find them by opening just the studio app
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 19:59:55 And
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:02 I forgot what you do from there
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:34 That takes longer
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:41 You open the studio apps
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:45 You go to file
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:48 And I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:00:54 You can find autosaves from there
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:09:43 Can't I'm at school and that's illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:35:23 Dang Roblox got die diseae
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:21:24 Lard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:21:37 Lard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:23:29 I use pistons to reload my rail gun so I can shoot the big planes that use the entire runeway to take off
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:23:42 Without respawning
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:23:49 Because respawning takes time
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:24:05 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:32:15 If I manage to get my railgun to be aimable, it's going to be the hottest thing I've ever created
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:33:04 I can't wait until Richard and Mak get around to making the building areas bigger
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:33:13 It's going to be a while
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:33:21 But it's gonna be cool when they make it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:34:25 Venator?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:34:32 Venator class star destroyer?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:34:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:35:53 When Mak or Richard add the whitelisting thing, the noobs are going to be so annoying
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:36:05 "PLS HELP ME BUILD"
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:36:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:36:39 Noob
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:36:58 Well yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:37:00 Is spamm
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:01:14 
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:01:18 long thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:48:15 i really cant wait until richard adds timers, delays, and logic gates to the game
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:48:20 my rail gun would be so hot
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:48:32 yeah why not
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:48:35 sounds fun
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:58:09 the loading mechanism of my rail gun is going to require so many buttons
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 23:58:14 richard pls add logic gates and timers
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:11:41 
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:12:00 this server

creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:47:58 god
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:48:00 im finally done
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:48:19 i finally finished my reloadable rail gun
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:48:25 it has taken me
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:48:29 seceral hours
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:49:11 i cant wait for logic gate stuff, and for normal half blocks to be back
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:50:37 Re-loadable Rail Gun. 454 parts. the reloading mechanism is everything except the tube with magnets on it. took me several hours to complete, cant wait for normal half blocks to be back as well as the off-set ones.
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:50:43 
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:54:49 oh and i just realized i got my warp drive role taken away
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:54:50 why tho
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:55:40 oh so i cant catch em all
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:55:42 lame
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:21 i've improved my rail gun so that it's reloading is more reliable
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:26 now to make it aimable
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:31 well
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:34 in a few hours
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:36 gnight
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:41 watch out sky bois
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:51:46 the rail guns aiming for ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:32:37 Yup that's winter
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:35:30 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:35:37 The bus got here on time for once
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:35:56 So guys got used to the late time so they aren't here
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:36:09 But me es no complaino
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:36:21 Or whatever "I'm not complaining" is in spanish
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:36:36 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:39:14 For some reason the fullest busses get the smallest busses
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:46:37 Richard, when you turn the half blocks back to normal, leave the current half blocks as they are and add the normal half block as a separate block because I made a rail gun that runs using the off-set half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:47:08 They're really useful for making things slide
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:47:14 Wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:49:02 Ice blocks slide, yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:49:24 But you can't make tubes out of them and expect blocks to freely slide through them
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:51:45 Autocorrect is are have supid
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 15:52:17 Idk how and idc because usually it helps
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 16:15:25 Richard, you gonna keep offset half blocks or nah
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 16:16:27 Neatish
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 16:16:55 I wanna keep the off set slabs because they make it possible to make tubes where things actually slide through
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:09:44 Aight now for logicc gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:10:14 Jk I'm still gonna have to wait

plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:12:12 no no
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:14:58 If Richard takes away the off set half block without putting something in it's place we're legally allowed to leave
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:15:26 Because the thing I made depends on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:15:30 Because
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:15:37 Without it we can't push blocks through tubes
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:15:57 I'll show it when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:16:23 But normal blocks make it nearly impossible to properly confine blocks while also moving them
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:16:42 I don't use wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:16:47 I use warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:16:55 So idk what that is but sounds good
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:17:45 He gave a bad example
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:17:48 He's bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:17:58 I'll show you the true use of them when I get home
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:18:17 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:18:28 Rip I'll put a reminder in my reminder discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:18:34 It's just a dead discord server

the-dump 2018-11-15 17:22:47 Posting files is illegal in 50.5 states
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:25:55 I used to think magnets were useless until I noticed that my prototype railgun moved slightly even though the projectile was still attached
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:26:03 Then I decided to experiment
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:26:09 And I invented the warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:26:23 Well, I didn't invent it
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:26:50 Shut the up, asking for upvotes is like a YouTuber asking for likes
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:32:49 Reverse
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:33:10 Because he helped Richard test
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:33:20 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:33:34 That's because that didn't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:33:53 It's given to people who tests Richards stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 17:42:16 Pretty fragile pp

plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:02:30 Idk, I don't have problems with them
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:02:55 Petition to make Richard work on logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:03:26 Oh that's your fauly
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:03:28 Fault
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:04:29 Oh well
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:04:59 Richard is too busy being peer pressured into working on logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:06:35 Yeah because Richard needs to add logic gate so I can fling people with less effort
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:07:45 Anyways I made a reloadable rail gun yesterday, today I'm going to make it aimable
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:08:11 Logic Gates would be helpful but Richard hasn't caved to peer pressure yet so oh well
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:12:04 Wait magnets weld?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:12:23

plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:26:17 Mak and Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:28:37 I'm gonna put some final touches on my reloadable rail gun, and then I will make it aimable, and all of the planes shall die of death disease
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:29:24 The emojis
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:29:29 They get oberpopulated

plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:30:33 Oh cool you should leak it
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:58:24 Fully aimable and reloadable rail gun. 768 parts.
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:58:29 
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:58:49 idk what rank ill get but maybe the mods will think of something to give me
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:06 coaxial?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:09 what does that mean?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:46 HEELLLL NO
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:01:16 the reloading mechanism ALONE on this thing took me about 8 hours to get right
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:01:32 im not going to double it up and make it even more complicated with 2
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:02:08 my railgun is magazine fed
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:02:25 but it takes a bit of pushing and shoving to get the bullet in the barrel
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:02:51 but once thats done, the thing is fully aimable, and it almost hit a plane, actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 06:08:48 
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 06:31:30 everyone who didnt save for hours is probably very, VERY upset
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:52:39 They should invent speed damage
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:52:52 So that my reloadable rail gun is actually useful
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:53:41 That would be difficult considering that the projectile's total mass is a single block
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:54:40 <@217336009455566848> Richard, invent special relativity so that we can pack massive amount of energy into a single block when it goes close to the speed of light
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:54:57 Isnt difficult
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:55:09 Just make it so that as things go faster, they get heavier
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:09:59 I got 1.18e+15
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:10:03 Get good
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:46:33 Ay Richard if you're reading this, you like my suggestion or nah?
the-dump 2018-11-16 16:59:12 
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:10:39 No you should make a uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:10:40 Lard
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:12:20 Roblock mans weight 1 3/4 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:13:19 Just an FYI for people who really need to perfectly balance things
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:28:14 Fun fact: Roblox is short for Dynablocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:29:56 Shut the up it's short for dynablocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:37:13 I can't wait until Richard makes the building areas bigger so that I can put my reloadable rail gun on something
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:37:55 What's with the Morse code
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:38:11 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:49:12 Scamming the scammer?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:49:14 What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:51:19 Whenever a free robuck scammer tries to scam me, I start using random computer terms and say that Roblox has an error on some local networks, and say to fix it they need to delete system32
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:53:33 Very
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:56:12 Wumpus
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:56:13 Lil
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:56:15 Lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:57:35 
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:57:44 I made an aimable, reloadable railgun
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:57:47 It's hot
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:58:44 The reloading mechanism would be smaller if the half blocks weren't off set by a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:58:56 But it's worth it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:59:11 Because the off-set let's the blocks slide through easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:06:16 I'm gonna need to add pistons to my rail gun's barrel so that it stops wiggling
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:06:31 Shouldn't be hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:06:49 Just some pistons and some un-powered motors
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:08:15 And some more pistons to move the other pistons as the barrel moves up
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:10:26 And once the wedges are fixed and I make the loading mechanism smaller, I can make the cannon more powerful
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:10:50 Maybe even make it double barreled
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:11:21 Maybe make it small enough to fit in a tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:11:24 So many idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 19:54:36 Richard has been suspiciously quiet
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 19:57:35 Yeah Richard makes plane crazy with a hint of mak
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 19:57:57 But plane crazy is in alpha
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 19:58:02 So expect glitches
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 19:58:04 And stuffs
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 20:07:16 You should get ants
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 21:25:04 For Christmas you should add **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:18:25 Ay guys let's peer pressure Richard into adding special relativity who agrees
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:20:11 Yes I shall accellerate a half block to 99% the speed of light and it shall weight 400 suns
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:20:15 What
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:20:38 Link?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:20:47 Oh you mean button that activates stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:21:20 I mean, making a pressure plate will form a template for logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:21:22 So yes plox
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:21:36 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:21:49 What does this one do
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:21:57 Except for off set wedges
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:22:12 "this one" update
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:22:14 Wot do
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:23:02 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:23:17 Sorry brbed fir a sec because a veteran entered the class
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:23:45 Logic Gates will be neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:23:54 And they need to come with delays
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:24:06 It's gonna make things hot
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:24:15 And then sensers and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:24:59 And then memory blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:25:26 And once memory blocks are added I shall make a neural network learn how to murder people
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:26:03 Don't let that discourage you tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:26:15 It's just the demo version of the Future
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:26:26 Jk robots will be nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:27:07 Sorry but doland turmp has big idc
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:27:32 Rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:27:34 Whut
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:27:52 O fuck
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:27:58 <@217336009455566848> ban me
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:28:17 I violated rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:28:33 Boi
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:28:45 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:00 No it's a joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:03 Don't do pls
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:37 ?stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:39 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:48 Yeah that's a human function
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:29:49 My b
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:10:41 theres this guy in my server
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:10:54 with the heaviest thing i've ever seen move
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:11:00 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:12:29 that would be why
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:12:58 anyway back to my story
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:16 theres this guy in my server with the heaviest vehicle i've ever seen move
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:27 so i got him to help me test my rail gun
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:35 with full density bullets
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:49 and they didnt even budge him
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:58 but when i got my interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:14:03 it looked like thanos snapped him
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:14:07 one second hes there
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:14:30 the next, he wasnt, except for some pistons popping out of existance
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:14:32 it was beautiful
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:15:56 what rank would an interdimentional fidget spinner capable of destroying anything it touches get me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:16:14 autismo rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:16:16 hell yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:16:22 give it here 🅱
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:17:28 im starting to think that my weaponized version of the interdimentional fidget spinner is the tame version
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:38:25 slow mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:38:30 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:58:51

plane-crazy 2018-11-19 15:46:12 B)
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:30:12 A horse
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:30:33 Sea horse*
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:30:46 Heck
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:30:48 It's a
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:30:57 Is it a water plane?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:33:10 When Richard makes the lag resistant suspension, I'm going to make the dankest warp drive anyone has every seen
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:33:30 Also I'm going to make a new suspension cannon, this time with more suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:34:31 No, rocket propelled guns don't exist and never will
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:34:42 Because that's called a rocket launcher
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:35:25 <@386680166962954251> did it look like this?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:36:37 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:36:55 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:36:57 Inspiring
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:37:14 I need to redesign it now anyways since Richard remove the off set half block
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:37:25 Luckily I convinced him to add an off-set full blocc
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:37:44 Nein
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:13 The only thing I know how to do with magnets is make them deadly
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:31 Hmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:34 I suggest
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:39 Putting it in a rail gun
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:43 And day it hovers
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:48 Say
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:38:49 Aaa
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:06:24 I hope that soon people will be able to control a plane at the same time as you so that you can have multiplayer battles in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:10:17 if you say any emoji that uses w as the mouth you are legally required to go commit guest
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:12:25 Fun fact: my English teacher is a communist vegan
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:13:03 Relatable <@275289470276730880>
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:14:08 I thought there was an autoclicker detector and that kept killing me, until I clicked once and died and I knew Richard can't be that bad at making autoclicker detector's
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:14:52 Richard is usually good at scripting so I knew it couldn't be an autoclicker detector
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 19:54:48 Richard hasn't spoken in a while
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 19:54:49 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 19:55:49 The main developer of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 19:55:56 <@217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:27:28 Oi Richard if you see this, how is the pressure plate coming along?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:27:51 Because the pressure plate is the precursor to logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:27:54 So I must know
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:30:13 No Minecraft are have is the big homosexuality
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:30:40 A guy in my server did
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:30:44 It was bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:32:17 A net launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:32:29 The port and starboard attachments were added for block count
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 04:05:49 did richard make the suspension less laggy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 04:05:58 my titan cannon isnt nearly as lagy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 04:06:02 laggy*
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:32:42 You always ask for help when. I'm at school
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:32:44 Sadd
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:32:46 Also
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:32:58 You doin the pressure plates or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:33:02 <:kermit:506299097079218196>
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:34:00 K
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:34:21 When you do, I'll be happy, because pressure plates will clear the way for logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:40:00 Green and brown
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:40:24 He means green and brown
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:40:29 He has autocorrect
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:40:37 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:42:15 They do
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:45:23 
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:45:41 Someone said something about a noob skin
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:46:04 The 3 legs wasnt stable so now it's an arachnid and has 4
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:47:53 He's a good noob
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:47:58 Not a bad one
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:48:18 People think he's bad because he has 8 legs like an arachnid
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:49:18 I will once I'm home
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:49:33 I reposted that picture because someone said something about a noob skin
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:50:02 Looks good
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 16:08:55 I dont
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 16:08:58 I have gyazo
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 16:15:15 Next contest should be making a reloadable rail gun that shoots at least 5 shots
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:10:18 What did dragon do?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:10:21 I wanna know
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:10:51 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:01 You should ban him
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:15 I vote ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:44 Boi
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:57 Too bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:21 That's like saying blacks are fucking gay but you were quoting racist 4chan user
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:28 Still racist
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:56 Eh
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:58 Too bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:05 Time for ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:19 Just ban him, everyone will understand and accept
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:42 We did look at the context
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:50 Doesn't really change anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:14:09 You're a returd
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:14:16 I didn't mean it in the mental context
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:14:19 Just the idiot context
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:14:22 So I'm not bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:16:35 In my other discord, if you post a meme with any remote amount of racism, you get immediately banned without warning, even if you are an admin
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:17:06 Jameson just ban him please
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:18:13 He would be worthy of kick if he just ignored him, he would be worthy of another chance if he apologized, he should be worthy of a ban for lying and denying everything and being stupid
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:18:28 K
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:18:30 Ceased
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:20:26 You'reur mom
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:20:55 Dragon, stop making yourself look like more of an idiot than you already do
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:21:06 Just give it up
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:21:14 Boi
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:21:15 Cease
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:21:46 Are we allowed to say cracker though?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:21:51 It's the white n word
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:22:10 CEASE
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:22:30 Aight k
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:24:07 K
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:24:52 Purple fish
(Inside joke with my computer science class)
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:24:59 It actually was
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:25:01 Good times
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:25:20 It isn't bad btw
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:25:50 The joke is, whenever we didn't have a Sprite for a thing we made, we used a purple fish so it became an inside-meme
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:01 So we occasionally just snuck in a purple fish
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:08 K neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:19 Heavy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:27 Useful for ramming machines
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:34 BOI
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:41 SHUT THE UP PLEASE
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:30:47 I made a rail gun that launches full weight ballast blocks at what looks like the speed of sound, because once it leaves the barrel it can only be seen for one frame then it's somewhere else. But it can't even budge big creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:30:49 Smh
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:30:53 Must make it faster
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:02 With most heaviness
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:07 Most magnets
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:10 Everybody dies
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:16 Including framerate
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:25 That's what it does
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:30 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:32 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:59 But it fires blocks with 10 density, and it fires multiple of them so they all get accelerated
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:32:52 Jameson, just ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:32:59 He's not going to stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:20 Jameson
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:26 Nobody would be mad at you
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:31 You have enough evidence
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:35 Just remove him
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:35:13 Jameson, just
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:35:37 Ehhh good enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:35:46 But ban is preferable
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:39:01 For every action is an equal and opposite reaction. Unless the action is done with magnets, alparently
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:43:58 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:44:03 Do a freaking ?ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:45:06 Yeesh, the mods and admins here are so lenient
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:45:13 I guess that's admirable
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:45:24 But a bit annoying when it comes to creatures like dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:45:50 ?define stop using bot commands
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:20:19 If we had bigger build areas, my reloadable rail gun would actually be able to fit on something
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:22:59 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:23:09 Idk actuallu
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:23:18 Imma just say what I always say
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:23:21 Pressure plates
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:23:23 Nao
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:45:55 Inhale chlorine challenge
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:46:59 I should turn my cursed oofer into an oofer worm
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:47:16 Also can you just mite dragon at this point
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:47:29 He's not just annoying you admins, he annoying  us as eell
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:47:33 Well*
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 19:58:05 Heheheh

plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:00:35 Yay
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:00:44 Rick noticed how stupid dragon is
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:00:47 Prepare for ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:01:44 Sorry kiddo your ranks were donated to charity
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:13:08 Below is bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:19:47 That MADATTAK is fake confirmed
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:20:26 Rip he's about to get fired
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:21:10 I dme madattak every couple of days asking if hisndms were still open until he closed his dms
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:21:22 👌
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:21:56 How does Richard know that the actual madattak was pinged?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:22:10 Richard ismadattak confirmed
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:22:44 Yay
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:23:00 Now ban dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:41:49 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:42:06 Pre-set block settings gui
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:42:13 
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:42:39 Pls, it's annoying making massive suspension cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:42:44 Oh yeah that reminds me
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:42:53 Did you make the suspension less laggy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:43:03 My Titan Cannon is nowhere near as laggy as it used to be
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:43:17 Or did you make the Pistons less laggy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:43:28 Either way, you did sonething
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:45:24 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:46:24 Richard, did you change the suspension or the Piston?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:46:34 My suspension cannons are a lot better now
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:46:38 They're less lagg
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:46:47 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:49:03 I think Richard changed the Pistons to make them stronger, because my suspension cannon readies up much quicker
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 20:49:10 So I think that's why it's less laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:00:46 Why do we need to save data?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:01:11 Is there a max to it or something?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:01:14 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:01:18 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:01:47 Oh, 260k, thought it just said 260, I thought I was way past max lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:19:21 hah
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 21:19:48 sorry I don't speak room service
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:19:13 richard i asked a question a few hours ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:19:45 did you change the suspension or the pistons? my suspension cannon is a lot less laggy than it used to be and readies up a lot quicker so that made me curious
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:20:13 why does he always ignore
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:20:14 so sad
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:20:27 yeah its called a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:22:18 richard why u no respond
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:22:52 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:22:52 its not a nagging question, i noticed that my suspension cannon readies up a lot quicker now, and its a lot less laggy, so i wante to know
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:22:55 weird

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:49:18 Did Richard make the suspension lag resistant yet?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:49:44 Feel like he did because the suspension is a lot less laggy than it used to be, and it doesn't wiggly from side to side
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:49:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:50:24 People just call him Rick because it's short for richael which is italian for Richard.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:53:05 Rachel

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:14 Good enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:36 Wait, lag update
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:38 Pls no
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:41 I don't want more lag
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:56 Oh, no lag update
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:25:57 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:26:23 Can I have a free rank called dank spanker
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:26:32 Aw
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:27:03 I want a rank called "ceo of Roblox"
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:27:55 out Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:27:59 I have a question
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:28:30 Did you add the prismatic constraint to suspension? Because it looks like the suspension I a lot less laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:28:46 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:28:50 That's what I thot
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:29:09 Hec
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:29:23 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:29:52 So there isn't a prismatic constraint on it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:29:54 Weird
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:30:14 Either the suspension or the Pistons got a lot less laggy a week or 2 ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:30:52 Delete yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:32:21 True
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:34:07 Above is extra nothing
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:20:17 oi richard, does the build gui thing include the thing where you can pre-set settings for blocks or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:16:43 FUCK
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:16:51 RICHARD BROKE THE WARP DRIVES
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:17:34 oh nvm the magnets range was just
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:17:35 weird
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:34:58 <@!217336009455566848> you broke the missiles

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:00:51 smh
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:01:39 just curious on the requirements for AI Engineer
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:02:11 like, do we just have to make a block that responds to whether or not people are in a place?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:02:29 or can we go as simple as if this and that then thont
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:02:53 yeah but you can get it if you make an AI
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:02:56 thats what the guy said
bug-reports 2018-11-27 15:47:46 You broke the got damn missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:21:00 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:21:06 Fix the got damn missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:21:27 Oh you already said yes in bug reports
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:21:40 Neat
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:06:18 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:06:20 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:06:23 Rachel
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:06:54 Are you gonna add the GUI that allows you to set the settings a block before you put it down or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:07:57 Richard answer my dern question or I will permanantly change your name to rachel
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:08:07 Boi

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:45:28 It's a rad leak
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:48:13 Huh, you know what's weird?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:48:19 **logic Gates**
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:48:41 Like they just change the flow of information
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:48:49 Weird things
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:49:00 And they let you make vtols that fly themselves
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:49:03 So strange
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:47:39 So many glitches
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:47:41 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:47:45 Why u gligch so kuch
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:47:47 Much
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 20:29:56 Plane crazy is glitchier than my brain
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:15:26 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:15:28 No chances
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:15:44 You used them all when you stole that candy from your sibling when you were 3

plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:26:57 What update
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:27:01 Logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:27:37 Aight tell me when you ad logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:27:51 Lag fox
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:27:52 Fix
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 20:27:53 Aa

plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:16:49 correct
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:26:30 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:26:40 Did you see my suggestion yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:26:47 It got around 20 upvotes
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:27:06 It said to make a channel where you tell us what updates are planned
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:46:12 I'm going to make a neural network that will learn to walk better than any of you have ever walked
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:46:39 He's going to walk so well that you guys are going to need to use wheel chairs to avoid shame
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:46:52 No Stephen
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:46:58 He's going to walk better
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:47:04 Not necessarily faster
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:47:07 But better
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:48:05 The more your walking explores, and the cleaner the movements, the better the walk
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:49:17 Hell yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:49:19 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:49:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:49:23 Christmas
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:49:28 Not something nsfw
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:50:21 Santa is just misspelled satan
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:52:01 When it's literally just 2 leaves laying in top of eachother
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:52:05 Like they always do
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:02:57 Neural networks get it easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:03:46 I wish I could clone myself 40 times, each doing different decisions and wait until they all die then learn from that and then learn from their mistakes and clone myself again and repeat
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:14:54 I don't want moderator
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:15:10 I'm already busy with other discords sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:39:45 Anti air guns are just long range shotguns
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 21:44:49 Somebody tell Rachel that his name is now Rachel until he adds logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 22:58:24 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 22:58:36 i just realized that richard also means dick
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 22:58:48 ive been calling rick dick this whole time
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 22:58:52 rick the dick
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 22:58:53 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:14:42 when you say hello to someone and they reply "yello"
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:43:13 i gotta say, the only bad thing about eating a 1 pound block of cream cheese is having to hide it when your family walks by to avoid shame
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:43:47 no thats too much even for a level 14 lard like me
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:44:03 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:44:22 i made a rope launcher with port and starboard attachments

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:24:52 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:02 pinewood builders was having a game night
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:08 and we played survivor
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:16 and we had to vote off a friend
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:18 so yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:19 it was sad
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:33:03 well stop it then
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:32:25 Mmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:32:30 Logic gates.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:31:24 What's up homozygous recessives
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:11:49 hmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:11:59 do magnets affect people in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:12:05 LAME
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:12:20 they dont affect other peoples creations?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:12:25 aight time for a suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:52:44 you tell your secretary to hire a bodyguard for you and this guy walks through the door, wyd?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:17:16 So I am the vice king of a leaf group and we take some sacred screenshots and here is a good one
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 22:44:42 Okay so he's garunteed to get banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 22:44:54 Might as well ban him right now and get it over with
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:11:08 what does the pvp button do?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:11:41 no i mean the one you see in-flight
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:18:12 Sacht
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:25:00 Petition to make Richard work on logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:26:10 
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:26:13 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:26:22 -walks away-
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:37:37 It's a plane that spins
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:27:11 Nah b nitrogen is only for plantts
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 15:37:31 Is anybody else concerned about his name?
general 2018-12-06 15:46:36 I made a neural network that learns how to walk
general 2018-12-06 15:46:41 https://gyazo.com/f5e99909fec831b0adf4d04ff7ed5448
general 2018-12-06 15:46:50 He 🅱e walkin
general 2018-12-06 15:46:54 Kinda
general 2018-12-06 15:47:34 This was an old version before I realized that I needed to add -.5 to his outputs so that he could walk in any direction
general 2018-12-06 15:47:39 But still
general 2018-12-06 15:47:54 He learned to not stick to the wall
general 2018-12-06 15:48:21 Now he's learning to turn a corner
general 2018-12-06 15:49:16 I feel like the proud dad of 40 clones
general 2018-12-07 03:07:08 well the souls of all of the previous generations of Stephen kept giving input on the situations like the whiny bitches they are because APPARENTLY when you destroy a script it still runs, so you have to disable it after you destroy it
general 2018-12-07 03:07:12 stupid dead people
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:04:56 Family vlog #173. She took the fucking kids.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:58:33 Don't you hate it when all of the dead generations of Stephen tell the living Stephen that he's doing a good job even though he's the worst of his time, because APPARENTLY when you destroy scripts, they still run. So you have to disable them
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:58:45 Frekkin Stephens
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:58:58 He's a neural network
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:01 He's a good boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:11 
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:16 Very good boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:23 Good at walking into walls
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:35 Like the idiot he is
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:42 Frekkin Stephen and his 40 brothers
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:44 Ye
general 2018-12-07 21:19:48 I think
general 2018-12-07 21:19:55 That you just broke the fucking rules
general 2018-12-07 21:20:16 <@456226577798135808> we got an advertiser
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 21:21:57 When Richard doesn't check suggestions for .3 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 20:07:22 richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 20:07:29 eeeeee
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 20:18:11 A
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 20:46:42 inf max torque? >:)
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 20:46:47 i must explore
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 07:06:36 -points engines up-
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 07:06:40 wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 07:46:36 fun fact:
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 07:46:37 AAAAAAAAAA
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 18:35:01 hey richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 18:35:06 nvm
general 2018-12-09 20:59:41 when leaf gang comes out with new sweaters for the boys and you need to check them out
bug-reports 2018-12-10 02:52:28 oi richard could you fix the thing where if you push a button twice instead of turning off, it turns on even though its already on
bug-reports 2018-12-10 02:52:29 pls and thank
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:40:17 Light the wing
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:44:26 nerded
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 18:09:33 When you build a thing that makes you go faster than the speed of light but you go to the deadlands
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:31:14 The forbidden word
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:31:23 <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 04:12:20 somebody made something that kidnaps people
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 15:43:28 I made a plane that goes 800 sps without engines, and it's not laggy, and it doesn't wiggly wobble
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 15:44:08 Planes usually get wiggly wobbly because the center of pressure is too far behind the center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 15:44:29 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 15:51:24 Also too many wings can cause you to spazz and contract die disease
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:19:19 I spy with my little eye an anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:19:48 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:19:57 Why do you always test when I can't join
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:19:58 Aaa
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:22:42 There are people in class talking about 🆎ortnite
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:25:09 When you build a thing that glitches and warps into the deadlands but you realize that it can be used as a weapon
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:41:57 Go commit contract die
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:42:46 Oof brb my cats barking
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:49:57 I dont want to get religious or anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:50:03 But what the fuck are oranges
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:50:45 I dont want to be muted or anything but shut your up
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:54:03 Aa
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:57:21 I wonder how fast I can make a plane while having it be controllable
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:57:37 I got a plane going 900 and it was a really good flier
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:57:41 So who know
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:57:50 No wait wot to yourself
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:57:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:58:22 And I used actual aerodynamic science to make it not wobble
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:58:46 Planes usually wobble because the center of pressure is too far behind the center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:59:20 I kinda wish that the game showed center of pressure but I dont blame richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 17:59:29 Because I'm not sure how he would be able to script it
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:00:20 Anyways, can't wait to get home to see how fast I can make a plane go
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:00:30 I'm guessing eventually it will get too laggy
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:00:51 But the current design flies beautifully
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:00:56 No lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:17 I always make things go insane speeds
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:25 Like the interdimentional fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:40 It went 1.42e+16
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:45 I believe
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:47 So yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:01:57 Interdimentional fidget spinner is king of speed
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:02:04 And king of destruction
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:02:13 Anything close by gets warped with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 18:07:34 Peasants, if I was there I would use my interdimentional fidget spinner to slap your ass into oblivion
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 20:34:56 It would be put on a ship with a powerful reactor
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:16 smh
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:16 normal planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:19 why not a fuggin uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:22 uuuhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:25 magnet plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:14:52 thats because you have stupid in the ways of magnet planing
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:15:03 observe thot
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:16:39 https://gyazo.com/9f51867e12eb9a19913568247980f85f
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:16:47 observe
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:16:54 the beauty of magnet planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:05 youre are big ew
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:07 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:14 its too fast for combat
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:30 theyre for weight because im too lazy to take them off
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:44 well you are have stupid
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:19:39 this is the normal speed of this bad boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:20:34 its wing design keeps it stable at high speeds
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:20:45 not even guns can catch it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:21:24 yeah so its a stalemate
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:21:32 well, i would have a better chance at it than you
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:21:37 chance at hitting*
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:22:17 mmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:22:32 well it could move out of the way of your bullets
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:22:43 put what
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:23:28 k hol up let me make ungrades
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:23:41 bigger engine thyme
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:07 okay bigger engine is a little too dank
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:13 instantly hit freedom speed
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:15 1776
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:26 but it spazzed
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:29 sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:50 aight lemme just delete a few more wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:25:59 the speed is causing too much lift and its making them spazz
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:27:55 frekkin wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:28:05 im basically going to be flying without wings at this point
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:30:30 frikkin ropes and suspension cant handle the power
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:39:00 my plane is getting closer to being stable
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:39:45 we;;
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:39:48 well*
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:39:52 its stable
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:39:54 only problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:40:04 it yaws to the left a bit for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:40:21 ill fix it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:42:08 how tf am i supposed to know
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:49:07 okay
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:49:09 its stable
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:49:14 until you try to turn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:51:45 i had to slow him down
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:51:46 so sadd
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:52:07 im not yet going to deem it impossible to go that fast and be stable
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:52:12 but its not lookin good
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 16:55:54 How many stupids does it take to not use car blinkers?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:06:33 Hoe lah
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:07:00 Hue hue hue oi oi croissant baguette
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:07:03 Snails
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:07:24 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:07:40 Yo no habla minimum wage
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:10:46 I have a fast plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:11:16 I tried to make it faster but for some reason at high speeds it yaws to the left
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:14:40 Idk what happens when my plane's power goes to 0, it used magnets. I'll see what happens today since it's fixed so ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:17:33 Why does logo look fat
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:17:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:25:28 Memes can be nsfw you little spaghetti hoe
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:25:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:26:04 Yup
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:26:20 Yeah

plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:48:52 Remembee kids, if your profile is anime then you are default inferior and you legally lose your right to reproduce
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:49:48 I can tell you from experience, pointless, don't argue with mods
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:49:54 They know what theyre talking about
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:50:01 And you arguing makes things worse
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:51:45 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:01 So the bots died at the perfectly wrong time
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:09 Manual kick it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:29 Right click their name
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:34 Click kick
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:53:05 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:53:32 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:53:47 Aight
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:54:03 Now that that one is gone, time to get rid of the anime pfps
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:54:29 <@185171693566689280>
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:57:30 Pointless, how many stupids so you have?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:57:37 Like, 7?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:01:00 Ew white background peasantry
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:01:24 I use dark theme because I like my eyes
the-dump 2018-12-12 19:26:13 
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:25:57 Fucked*
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:42:03 I spy with my little eye an anime pfp
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 21:01:57 Catapults are lame anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 21:02:04 Suspension cannons
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 21:02:05 Mmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:41:01 His name is Richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:42:36 I got my PSAT scores today
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:42:46 I got in the 77th percentile
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:42:47 Yee
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:43:18 It means I score equal to or higher than 77% of people
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:44:06 I wouldnt doubt it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:30:34 dont you hate it when your plane goes so fast that it destroys itself?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:31:13 oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:31:52 my plane can go 3000 sps for a couple seconds before it starts wobbling and then it turns kinda liquid and everything squishes together and away from eachother
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:32:22 a solid 10 seconds before it dies
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:32:38 theres a reason the wings have massive holes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:32:41 too much lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:33:51 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:33:55 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:33:59 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 06:34:07 yeah it wobbles too much
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:38:14 Si senora
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:38:22 I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:38:26 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:38:28 Russian
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:39:07 Okay I'm sorry I got Ds in Spanish for 2 years just to get out of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:39:39 I don't speak non-american. Even though that isn't a thing because if someone in America speaks a language, it's americano
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:40:02 But that doesn't mean I have to know what they sound like
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:49 Nearly every lamguage
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:58 If someone who speaks the language comes to america
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:43:01 They add to the mix
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:44:39 Well most people speak English, but it's kinda mixed up now, so it's English except with a pinch of whatever else moved to America
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:02 Yeah mostly spanish
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:05 Some arabic
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:10 And a lot of africano
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:19 Whatever languages they have
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:47:43 Yeah, that's why African Americans speak differently. Their great grand parents and stuff got to America, only knowing their language. So they learned English, put in a bit of African, taught their kids that, now it's a separate dialect. Like "he be working" is actually correct in their dialect. It means "he is employed", or "he has something to do", not necessarily "he is currently working"
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:48:18 I saw a video on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:48:24 And I'm very bored now
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:48:38 Hmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:48:47 How about
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:48:54 A plane launcher
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:01 Like an airplane launcher
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:05 Paper airplane thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:06 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:13 Hmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:20 How about
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:50:10 Try to beat my noob worm with legs and a top hat at walking over land
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:50:23 He's a good boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:50:24 Aw
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:50:27 Why not
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:50:47 Eh hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:51:12 Well I made a plane that can stabilly fly at 1900 sps
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:51:20 Kinda gets sketchy at 2100
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:51:40 And it has 10 seconds to live at 3000 before shattering
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:51:59 So you could try to make something go at a stable speed of 3000 or higher
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:52:21 Without dying
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:53:32 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:53:58 Mk then
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:54:13 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:54:21 That's a VTOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:54:36 Also that's a rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:54:38 Not a jet
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:55:23 Those look like rocket engines to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:55:55 Still a rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:56:16 It has to have jet engines to be called a jet
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:56:23 A what
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:56:30 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:57:09 Probation Stylist?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:57:29 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:57:30 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:57:40 Can't
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:57:43 I'm on mobile
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:58:42 Is that like
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:58:50 Polish
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:59:01 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:59:04 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:59:05 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:59:45 France?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:59:55 Oh wait it's germany
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:10 Bahdren, yes it does
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:24 We don't call turboprops jet planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:32 We call them turboprops
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:43 We don't call the space shuttle a jey
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:45 Jet*
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:00:49 We call it a rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:01:18 I read your message
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:01:24 What's your point with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:01:31 Also it was made with a jet engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:02:06 It was made using a car with 2 giant jet engines strapped to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:02:17 So I don't see how that makes the space shuttle a jet
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:02:40 You don't need to use sign language on the internet
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:06:11 Richard*
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:06:30 Richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:08:14 Petition to change Richards name to bitchard if he doesn't add logic Gates by April 2019
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:09:22 Logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:09:26 Basically
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:09:45 The and get gives an output if both if it's inputs are activated
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:10:06 Or Gates give an output if either or both inputs are activated
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:10:22 Xor Gates give an output if only one of their inputs are activated
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:10:50 Nand Gates give an output if on or less if it's outputs are activated
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:10:52 Etc
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:15:12 That's Richard abuse
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:15:20 Don't random ping richard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:15:29 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:15:48 I saw something for about 1/8 of a second
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:16:02 Sorry sir
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:16:09 No weeb in this discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:16:52 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:53:40 Ay rochard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:53:43 Richard*
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:54:03 Logic Gates before April 2019 or your name is either Rachel or Bitchard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:54:36 Richard*
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:54:50 Maybe soon rachel
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:59:52 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:00:42 You're only allowed to bully Richard because he's somewhat famous so he needs to get used to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:01:32 And bullying devs is a good way to make them feel motivated to do things
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:01:50 Oi Richard if you don't add logic Gates before April 2019 your name will be Rachel
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:03:09 Your name will then be bitchard if you don't add logic Gates before June 2019
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:03:47 Won't stop me from naming him rachel
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:07:38 I CAN BREATH
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:07:40 **OXYGEN**
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:08:18 Aight so Richard is okay with Rachel so instead I'll name him Donald in April
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:10:42 Anyways yes. Richards name shall be Donald if he doesn't add logic Gates before april
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:12:32 Inf

general 2018-12-13 17:19:05 Aaa
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:28:23 Did you know;
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:28:27 Logic gates
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:28:43 Madattak?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:28:46 Whose that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:29:30 Oh boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:29:39 Do we get logic Gates for Christmas?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:54:30 Fun fact: Roblox was invented in 1976 by Robert Loxington.
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:02:45 Fun fact: Dutch is short for Duchard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:02:53 Richard is Duchard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:06:02 I just got a million dollar idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:06:24 A battering ram to knock down the human walls in the hallways at school
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:08:47 You know the freshmen standing in a giant crowd in the middle of the hallways?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:08:53 Easy way to take care of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 18:08:56 Battering ram
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:33:11 Oi Rachel are you planning to add logic Gates before April, or are you planning on getting your name changed to Barnaby
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:33:29 <@217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:33:51 Reads the message before pingg
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:34:07 Ee fine I'll copy paste the message
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:34:17 Oi Rachel are you planning to add logic Gates before April, or are you planning on getting your name changed to Barnaby
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:34:22 There
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:36:05 Aa Richard did you answer my frekkin question or nah
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:23:13 Richard you didn't answer my question
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:23:39 Are you planning on adding logic Gates by April, or are you planning on having your name changed to Barnaby?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:24:04 What's the hard part about them?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:24:19 They are supposed to work like;
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:24:30 Theres a block
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:24:35 You click settings
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:25:09 For the and Gates it could be "if this key and this key pressed, then this activated"
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:44:23 Who here thinks that James should be promoted to unranked
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:44:28 /e dab
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:44:35 Humor level up
general 2018-12-14 16:50:34 I learned a neat thing a few days ago
general 2018-12-14 16:59:05 (this is going to sound racist, but trust me, it's just studies and stuff) you know how a lot of black people have a gang talk? Well linguistic researchers whatever they're called actually say it's another dialect. It was made when Africans who only knew native languages came to America, and learned English but still kept a lot of their native language. They taught this to their kids, and the way they spoke had different meanings. Like "He be working" is actually correct in their dialect. It means "he is employed" or "he has a job/occupation", instead of what most people think it means; "he is working".
general 2018-12-14 16:59:11 It's actually pretty neat
general 2018-12-14 16:59:25 And after writing all that, a mod might delete it and I'll feel sadd
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 17:00:14 Don't you hate it when your plane flies so fast that it's shatters when it turns
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 17:01:46 That sometimes happens
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 17:02:07 But usually it can survive it with a lotta damage
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 21:31:56 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 21:31:58 Dah hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 21:32:06 Is that
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 22:46:56 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 22:47:04 A **WEEB**
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 22:52:01 Not as bad as mine
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 06:29:11 huh..
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 06:29:44 imagine the first sentient artificial intelligence asking "How was I created?"
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:01:08 could you guys not dumb here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:01:09 thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:01:42 thats the joke
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:01:55 it contracted ligma
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:02:13 wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:02:16 blurple
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:11:15 Fun fact: Swiss cheese was invented in Swisserland.
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:11:26 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:11:35 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:11:36 sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 15:46:11 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 17:59:42 <:TRIGGERED:522821633426194454>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 18:00:11 Because 2am for you is 1 pm for us
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:23:33 Let's see
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:23:40 A stud is about 2.5 inches
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:23:52 And one block is 2x2x2 studs
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:24:10 So blocks are about 5 inches long, tall, and deep
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:28:49 That looks like a normal frigate to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:29:55 My plane can got 3000 sps for 10 seconds before it cracks as falls apart. But it can go 1900 safely
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:30:02 In fact it flies really well
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:38:57 I have ethernet
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:39:00 Idk how good it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:39:48 You just said optical fiber is better tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:40:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:40:23 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:29:56 i got so bored while waiting for my brain to remember what i was doing before i stopped scripting, that i made poetry
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:33:39 i used to do python
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:33:46 but now i only do lua
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:33:52 and i made it longer
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:34:29 idk why but im actually proud
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:56:06 MMMMMM-HMMM
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:56:51 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:57:43 Once Henrik is complete, I'll submit him to devforum
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:57:58 He shall be the goodest good boy ever invented
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:58:16 He's a neural network
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 15:58:27 Well, 2 neural networks connected together
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:05:38 Why doesn't Big Mak talk here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:06:34 Instead of writing "I'm sorry" say "I am disappointed with myself for my incorrect decisions"
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:06:45 /e dab
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:53:56 Because it's a history game

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 19:43:49 The cult of the T-pose
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 19:43:57 What am I doing with my life
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 19:44:08 And why does this cult have 7 people in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 19:44:18 2 of them are debate students
general 2018-12-18 19:46:35 Delicious
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 20:09:27 Imagine what it would be like if **logic gate**
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 17:15:54 Somebody should invent something to help get rid of people who chew gum loudly
general 2018-12-20 15:48:06 Oh god
general 2018-12-20 17:22:11 Shut the up Minecraft is illegal in roblock disco server

general 2018-12-21 05:35:15 so im making an ai and holy shit
general 2018-12-21 05:35:21 
general 2018-12-21 05:36:26 how did 2 nodes that came right after eachother be so similar, with all positive digits in the first being the previous one but 1 added to it
general 2018-12-21 05:36:54 there are thousands of weights connecting to that, all randomly generated because it hasnt started learning yet
general 2018-12-21 05:37:04 the chances of that is just
general 2018-12-21 05:37:09 TINY
general 2018-12-21 05:37:51 and there are layers of the weights
general 2018-12-21 05:38:04 the first layer has 900 weights connected to each node
general 2018-12-21 05:38:44 5 nodes, so 4500 in total, and then it gets squishified in the sigmoid function, and but through more weights to the next year
general 2018-12-21 05:38:56 <:woah:516298810700464128>
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:06:55 They should make Lord Of The Flies into a real thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:07:13 Just put a bunch of 12 year olds on an island and see who dies first
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:07:49 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:08:09 Probably should put north Koreans out of their misery
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:08:21 Besides, would be interesting to see what they do
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:08:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 16:09:12 But if we put north Koreans on the island, they won't know what pubg is, so it would be interesting
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 18:29:14 Maybe trains will be useful for transporting my massive cannons
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:04:57 Dad Vlog #419: She Took The Fucking Kids

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:57:36 thamk
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:58:04 normally i would imagine that the constant nagging about a game would get annoying to someone, but i guess a good dev gets used to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:59:07 rick is an 11/10 dev. listens to the community
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:59:43 <@!422431544112709655> turn your computer off and on again
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:59:47 that should fix it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 01:33:04 damn ever since i started speaking spanish all the cool kids are doing it

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 03:20:38 i love my quadcopter design
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 03:20:45 it auto stabilizes without helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 03:20:56 and it also drops a large amount of explosives
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 03:21:15 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:56:12 you guys know what time it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:56:14 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:33:41 so this guy in my pvp server is being an asshole to everyone, and blocking people and using a turret to shoot them down
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:33:48 and i think i finally hit a soft spot of his
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:34:24 you did
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:04:57 fun fact
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:04:59 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:00 this works
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:16 i didnt invent it though
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:32 i saw a bacon hair next to me connect his tires and it started moving
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:34 and i thought
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:38 "holy shit"
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:05:50 yes

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 07:24:42 noob worm grew propellers
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 07:25:46 frick it needs the top hat
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 07:25:50 eh
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:28:06 <#490306593242611742> pictures and videos making things easier to copy?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:28:07 what
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:54:29 i've been working on a neural network for about a month now, i think 2. and today i FINALLY got it to work. i was expecting it to only get wobbly, worse and then a bit better. but i finally got it, so it ONLY gets better
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:54:33 Henrik is learning
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:57:15 not exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:57:34 hes having a hard time learning how to find the closest point on a block
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:57:48 hes learning, and hes getting closer
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:57:52 but its going to take a while
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:58:34 on average the imperfection of his decisions continuously go down, eventually, hopefully, they will reach 0 imperfection
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:12 im proud of my robo bitch
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:19 his name is Henrik
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:27 hes learning how to tell how far away walls are
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:45 **you think i can pixel art**
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:50:46 that looks like its 51x51 to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:51:07 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:32:52 whats more common, a child showing you a cool stick they found, or a dog showing you a cool stick they found?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:34:30 peasantry i flew 3000 speed in a magnet drive once, lasted a whole 17 seconds before it spazzed and died
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:34:36 then richard updated magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:34:41 and now magnet drives are sadd
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:34:55 i was PROUD of my magnet drive inventions
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:35:06 have i ever told you about the interdimentional fidget spinner?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:35:26 it spins so fast that whatever it whacks gets FLUNG
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:35:28 its beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:35:49 and if i dont turn off the magnet drives, it glitches. hence "interdimentional fidget spinner"
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:36:05 no thats gay
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:36:39 hopefully richard fixes the magnets so that my big magnet drives work again
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:36:43 i was proud
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:37:00 i had a design that flew stabilly, and was EASILY controllable at 2400 speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:37:07 3000 was too much though, as stated before
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:37:34 my friend wants to put a magnet drive in his train
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:37:55 because he made a design that can go 600 sps around corners
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:38:02 so he wanted to see how far he could push it
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:38:05 but FRIKKIN RICHARD
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:38:11 broken the DERN magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 07:38:18 what

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:25:32 jesus
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 07:26:21 you worded that kinda strange but i think you're accusing me of being 7

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:12:01 Well you can have as much save data as you want if you know how to do it correctly
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:12:06 I forgot the name for it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:12:19 Layered datastores I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:12:58 They may be multi-million but a website like Roblox takes a LOT of maintainance costs
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:13:08 Multi billion*

plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:31:29 i wonder if a neural network can learn to remember
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:32:05 you sound like you're thinking of it in a sci fi way
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:32:56 there are neural network structure types that allow for short term memory
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:32:58 so maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:33:15 but i think theyre hard coded to have short term memory, and not make their own memories
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:11:53 top 10 saddest anime deaths
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:03:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:04:59 And after that hopefully Richard will work on letting friends control creations, and maybe even have different controls being able to be set for each seatt
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:08:18 It's also known as blacklist
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:09:41 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:10:04 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:11:21 Well too bad, calling yourself Rick instead of your real name Richard is illegal impersonation of every Rick in the world. It's not Impersonation of Henricks but it's on thin fucking ice
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:11:49 It is
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:12:08 Because impersonation is illegal
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:12:13 That's how legal systems work
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:13:01 If you tell someone whose looking for a Rick that you're Rock, that's ilelgal impersonation regardless of whether or not your last name is the same
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:13:34 He just wants to protect his identity
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:13:42 His real name is Richard
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:14:09 Precisely
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:14:33 Nah it works for everyone
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:15:45 Well too bad if an officer says they are looking for "lil shit" and you say you're "lil shit" then you're under arrest and when they find out you're not the guy you're charged for impeding investigation
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:16:47 Hey Richard

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:23:22 Well it's incorrect
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:23:30 That's why cruscades were invented
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:24:20 Well you're calling somebody their incorrect name
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:24:54 You keep calling Richard "Rick", his incorrect name
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:24:57 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:25:15 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:25:38 Neither do you have real evidence that his name is Rick
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:26:04 Richard is dyslexic, he never learned how to spell his name
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:26:23 I'm his mother

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:27:31 You guys do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 17:27:38 I'll just call him by his correct name
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 18:41:05 Richard, are you going to do the thing where multiple people can drive the same vehicle at the same time?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 18:41:16 Like on guy on the turret and one guy driving
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 18:42:00 Dats why I'm asking him, not suggesting it

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:32:47 Before the magnets were changed, I had a plane that could fly stabilly at 2300 sps, and the maneuverability and flying quality of it was 11/10. It was fun to fly past the fast planes that used only rockets and make them look like the were only going 20 sps in comparison
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:36:29 I think maybe with anti-lag mode disabled on the magnets, now the drives might work better
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:36:34 But they were just sad before

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:30:55 Have you noticed that planes fly way more than birds? <:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:32:25 Fun fact: stupid was invented by xpert back in 1835 in order to compensate for how many scientists were sciencing
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:34:51 That's the point
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:39:18 I suggested adding woosh sounds to Richard but Richard hasn't replied so I think he doesn't want woosh so now am sad
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:40:19 <@256501003493441547> make the back propeller spin at different speeds until you find a speed that cancels out the spin of the main propeller
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:58:04 I would hella go to the doctor to get another surgery
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:58:07 Surgery was fun
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 20:59:28 I don't mean to get political or anything but what the fuck are oranges

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:01:43 Life hack: buy a kid and get it interested in something you aren't good at so you have competition to learn that thing.
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:03:10 
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:03:12 I did
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:04:41 Fuck
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:08:21 Magnet drives work again and I used them to make a UFO
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:10:14 https://gyazo.com/261a852684485ea7bb1a2d5c3be90d42
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:10:17 It's my UFO
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:24:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:24:50 The goddess of wet
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:39:36 I should make a double magnet engine super Sonic plane, and if aerospace engineering class taught me anything, k should be able to make not wobble
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:48:05 How do you submit suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:54:53 What
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:56:08 Ye wot u need 🅱
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 17:56:36 Click the camera button
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:41:05 When you walk into your English class and the substitute teacher immediately starts talking to you in German
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:41:58 It will push it down since the center of thrust is above the center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:42:04 And out of line with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:43:08 Well now that we know it's 234 character's long, all we need is a hash leak and use a library brute Force method to crack it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:44:19 We just put a guess into a hashing algorithm, if the guessed hash is the same as the actual hash, then the input is the password
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:44:26 That's how passwords are cracked
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:44:36 That's how Mafia works
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:45:02 FatAssMilf
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:45:07 It didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:45:34 I'm not a hacker I just know how password cracking works
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:45:40 It's a simple algorithm
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:45:53 Flied
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 18:46:08 It's flooed you idot

plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:01:58 and when i tested it today, it broke things just enough to where we still exist, but it removed my passenger's hats..... and my head
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:02:01 
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:02:14 oh yeah and the magnet drives are still here
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:02:16 
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:02:22 and we're floating
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 08:02:25 and moving very slowly

plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:46:57 If you knew you could respawn right back at home, we would all shoot ourselves just to see what it's like tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:47:52 I never got my friend shot because I'm a good friend :D
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:48:17 Same thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:48:27 Would be fun
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:48:36 Pain would become useless
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:48:41 Speaking of pain
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:49:05 Is it normal to like a little bit of pain or am I sadistic or whatever?
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:49:09 A little sizzle
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 15:50:09 I don't really like pain, but I make the best of when I get pain
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 16:07:24 Remember kids:
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 18:03:24 Yes give me the die gas

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:11:30 its sad
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:11:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:11:53 i said solo dev
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:11:58 this game has multiple devs
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:12:15 develop solo
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:12:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:12:26 richard and big mak
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:12:52 he still makes a bit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:12:56 he made the shell
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:13:02 richard fills the shell
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:13:14 <:boi:417489249571569675>
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:13:47 too bad his name is richard
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:14:12 you can have more storage data if you know how to store your data correctly
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:14:21 like encoders and decoders
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:14:24 and stuffs
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:14:28 shut the up
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:15:15 ay
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:15:21 i just broke the speed record
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:15:22 https://gyazo.com/8aa9ce984d86a77e2cc8767d7599d7ef
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:16:12 thats negative
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:16:20 so thats the speed smol record
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:16:36 its not moving but its moving at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:16:48 so a planck length every age of teh universe
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:16:51 so basically 0
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:17:20 if it was in reverse then it would still be positive, just another direction
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:21:59 look a shark
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:22:30 no they made it into a car

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:52:49 I built a plane that is stable at 3000 sps, and can turn without dying at 1500 sps
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:53:46 Dats racist
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:53:50 Delete that you little shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:53:52 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:54:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:54:15 The voices
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:54:19 They haunt me
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:54:43 Oh god
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:55:04 But I don't even know what that is
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:55:07 Help
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:55:18 Frick
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:58:57 It's the opposite of !dirty
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:59:51 I wonder what use an exploiter could have for exploiting the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 15:59:55 Fly exploits?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:00:11 Speed exploits?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:00:24 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:00:38 What use would they have for exploits?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:03 The game doesn't even have remote events or any weaknesses
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:07 Yeah probably
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:13 But that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:24 So technically plane crazy has the best anti exploit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:39 Just have no use for an exploit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:01:41 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:02:15 That's what we're saying
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:02:43 Yeah, maybe of anything an exploit will let you copy paste an entire person's build onto your plot
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:03:10 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:04:02 "pro exploiter"
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:04:11 So someone with basic knowledge of lua
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:04:17 I know
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:04:47 I used to make my own exploits... Until the engine owner blacklisted my key since he found out I was using the engine to make anti exploits
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:05:24 My dad owns America and can disable your life
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:06:05 My mom owns the milky way and she will delete your subscription to existence
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:06:35 No he only owns you
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:07:33 Hell yes

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:20:32 Dang
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:20:35 Nein wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:21:34 I wonder if I can make a plane out of fully dense ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:23:40 Maybe a really dense plane will make it fly nicer
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:31:00 Invent logic gates

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:39:50 Chicken nuggies
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:40:40 Fun fact:
Richard should add logic Gates >:/
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:42:10 None of the above

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:49:15 We're in entrepreneurship
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 16:52:54 Wot are you testing

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:15:32 Next semester I'm switched from. Algebra II to Algebra II/Trigonometry
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:15:38 Time to learn triangles
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:21:17 A ban is good for your social health
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:23:01 
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:23:21 It's a group I co own
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:23:23 Leaf gang
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:33:09 I'm waiting until near the end of submissions so that my creation gets more votes
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:34:59 Not exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:35:56 Near the end, the first creation people will see is mine, so when voting time ends, tah dah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:36:38 It usually works though
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:36:41 Not always
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:36:46 But usually
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:45:31 Helicopters are aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 17:45:36 Just slow ones
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:03:22 BFR
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:03:27 Big Fucking Rocket
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:05:23 You're thinking about the hopper. Aka the test model of the star ship
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:05:59 The star hopper won't be re-entering, so it doesn't need a heat shield
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:06:45 That's the point of the contest
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:06:51 It's supposed to be pretty
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:06:58 If it works at all, then it works
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:07:05 But it needs to look good
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:08:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:08:19 But I meant the hopper
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:08:30 The hopper won't be actively cooled since it won't reenter
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:08:41 But the actual star ship obviously will
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:09:11 And the steel is probably going to be a specially made alloy that doesn't expand from heat as much, so it will last longer
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:11:41 Also why does it have an Americanese flag on it? It's not made by a government agency like NASA
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:12:06 Yeah probably
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:12:47 I like the flag on it. But it makes it seem like it's made by America, not by spacex
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:12:58 Well, I guess the workers are americanese
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:13:10 It's a private company
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:13:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:13:33 Americano
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:13:57 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:14:16 I thought the government shutdown was a joke because the purge didnt happen yet lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:14:28 But apparently it didn't mean it like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:15:13 But yeah, the shutdown kinda ruins some scientific research
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:15:20 So that sucks
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:16:09 I used to be neutral on the Trump thing, but the government shutdown ruining scientific research makes me a bit against him
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:16:43 A wall is not worth a year of scientific research
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:17:08 Also migrating animals are gonna have a hard time
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:17:11 I'm not
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:17:14 Well
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:17:17 Just a little bit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:17:44 I'm trying to not be too political
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:18:37 Because people who get separated by geographical features slowly start to think differently from eachother
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:18:44 And then we don't like the other guys
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:19:03 And we realize we need to make sure they don't come over here and try to kill us
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:19:51 But we have countries for a reason. It's not because we're greedy per se
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:20:11 It's because for centuries we couldn't dig through mountains to say hello to those guys and talk about stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:20:19 And we only talked to the people close by
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:20:54 And we made opinions and then those guys over there decided they don't like how we think so we make borders and weapons to make sure they don't beat us up and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:21:29 And then some guys in particular said "hey I'll make them not beat us up" and then they become popular and people listen to them and then they go beat the other guys up
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:22:41 And then they suddenly had 2 towns that listened to them and they decided "this is a good idea" and then we get big countries and we research stuff to make it easier to defend and build more stuff and now were here
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:23:40 I'm explaining how civilization started
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:23:43 I'm bored
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:31:49 Shush
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:34:42 I used a magnet drive to make a UFO
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 18:34:55 It's a good UFO
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:14:29 Dank matter
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:14:47 Not necessarily dense
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:14:58 Just a lot of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:20:40 If you got 2, 1 cm diameter spheres, one of anti-matter and one of normal matter, there would be enough energy to make an explosion that is similar to a type 1a supernova
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:27:21 Fuck sticks
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:27:33 The power at my school went out
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 19:27:45 We were watching the office now in sad
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:40:53 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:40:54 More
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:55:26 That's because you don't do it right
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:55:51 My plane's go 1300 sps using magnet drives and I barely lag at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:22 I have 9
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:43 Used to have 13 but those ones added too much thrust
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:00 Oh, locking a fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:01 Smh
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:10 Secret
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:38 Pistons are one version of the magnet drive
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:44 They're more of a burst drive
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:57:55 They die after a few seconds
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:01 But speed you up real quicc
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:25 Ello richard
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:37 Surface controllers
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:39 What
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:58:50 Neat
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:59:15 Still want 2 people to be able to fly a plane, but that's neat
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:59:40 So that one guy can control a turret while the other runs away
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:00:48 Also Richard if you could make the 0.9 block 0.8 or 0.7 that would be appreciated pls and thancc
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:01:03 Ok thamk
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:01:14 Neat
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:01:54 Yeah explode on impact would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:03:51 When making your railgun rounds, make them 2 long, 1 normal block in the back, and one ballast in the front, so that way the center of pressure is behind the center of mass, so if flies straight
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:04:08 Np
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:04:55 Mine can launch fully heavy ballasts+normal blocks at extremely high speeds
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:04:58 It's gr8
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:05:11 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:05:27 My plane's use warp drives to fly
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:05:33 Sorry is a forbidden technology
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:06:08 I'm not good with ships
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:06:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:06:49 Hyperdrives are better and more reliable than normal engines if you design them correctly
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:07:18 It's hard to control how fast they go
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:07:38 Maybe add different controls to some magnets so that you can make it go at a different speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:10:40 Gtg

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:40:32 There was mouse control?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:40:35 What
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:41:11 Hold up bring it back for I sec I wanna test my super Sonic plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:41:50 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:41:53 Bring it back
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:42:00 I wanna test it on my super so plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:43:38 Wait, how did the mouse steering even work
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:44:04 Did the control sufaces know how to react to where the mouse was or something?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:44:11 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:49:24 Big suck
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 17:35:48 I should make a warp drive powered ban hammer
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 17:38:43 M80, he didn't even make it spin correctly
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 17:39:02 You're supposed to use warp drives
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 18:08:03 Why go to the store and buy food when that guy over there has all the nutrients you need?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 18:08:42 There's still ccium in there

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 21:38:13 <@216371990959882241> a 2d game has better aerodynamics because a 2d game is much simpler
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 21:40:24 When it comes to squares, moving up in dimensions adds 2*the number of dimensions minus one each time
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 21:41:30 1 dimensional square: a line, so 1 side, 2 dimensional square; 4 lines, 3 dimensional cube, 6 squares, 4 dimensional tesseract, 8 cubes

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:00:14 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:00:23 Idk why 12 people down voted it
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:00:46 Maybe they don't appreciate true art
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:00:55 Nob
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:01:49 Jk, it's not true art but it's still h0t
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:03:10 Doesn't even use helium, which I'm pretty sure some others dkd
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:03:18 Oh it can go a solid 500
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:03:39 Has to be kinda high first and pretty much fall foreward
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:06:02 Oh and it auto stabilizes somehow
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 16:06:40 I think it's because when it's facing a direction it speeds up in that direction and roblox's air resistance pushes the other side back down

general 2019-01-30 18:14:05 Im awkward when changing in the locker room so I always wore my sports clothes under my normal clothes. Today I decided I would try being brave. So I take my shorts out of my backpack and get nervous and just stare at my shorts with my pants still on for like 5 minutes and then some guy accuses me of having the gay.
general 2019-01-30 18:14:51 That's why irl bravery isn't my thing.
I'm not even fatt or anything, I even have a tiny bit of muscle, but it just feels weird changing in front of people.

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:38:55 Imagine making a box the size of a plot, using helium and low density ballasts to be light, then going over someone's creation and detatching the helium and trapping the guy
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:40:22 Bb gril if it wasn't for us americanos, England wouldn't have survived Germany
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:42:21 And your welcome that Jews still exist
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:44:58 Europe helped us exist
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:45:13 And they made us exist by selling us overpriced tea
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:45:49 England also helped protect us from the french
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:46:14 And then when we didn't like England's tea, we bought the French stuff
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:47:31 Then about 50 years later we win a war against ourself and then another 80 years later we send you guys destroyers to kill uboats,and you gave us all of your science stuff so we mass produced it and that's how we found the u boats
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:48:50 Then we put 2 pieces of u235 together above Japan, and then when they surrendered we went in with troops for whatever reason. But here's where America becomes the worst country in history: we left behind comic books which inspired the Japanese to make anime

plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:09:40 do propeller blades produce more thrust in water?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:11:30 why though
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:13:04 thats contradictory
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:13:46 thats basically saying pushing a pillow is harder than pushing a block of lead thats the same size as the pillow
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:14:47 if you push something heavy then you get pushed back harder
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:16:10 yeah, but getting it moving takes a lot more force, aka you push harder on it, aka you get pushed back harder from it
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:17:29 yeah, but props in water, going the same speed, should produce.. lemme do some math
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:21:03 did the math
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 00:21:22 a propeller blade in water should produce 81.63 times the force as a propeller blade in air

plane-crazy 2019-02-04 17:03:11 Supposed to go in the dump though
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 19:57:45 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 15:58:48 I don't play plane crazy as much as I used to. I've ran out of things to build
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 15:59:46 Yeah hopefully logic Gates are added some day
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 15:59:53 They will make things much nicer
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 16:02:14 I'm kind of neutral in politics
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 16:02:22 Trump is meh
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 16:02:47 Trump kinda sucks but he isn't as bad as a lot of people say
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 16:03:18 Berny was probably the best
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:14:32 Why do the school principals havr to say when something on the lunch menu is federally regulated during the announcements?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:14:43 "and the Federally Regulated wheat roll"
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:14:46 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:29:03 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:29:15 Is a high school
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:29:32 We don't have a lunch room either
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:29:43 We have a place called the mall
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:29:57 It's the central place where all of the hallways are connected to
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:30:31 Iof
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:30:32 Iof
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:30:34 Aaaa
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:30:36 Oof*
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:30:38 There
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 17:46:27 Hello mister sir
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 19:05:55 Richard when logic gate smhhhhg
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 19:42:50 Hah get learned
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 19:47:52 Does a Paper Pap?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 19:51:19 Youre a wizard Henry
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 20:18:38 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 20:19:13 So is that just like 50 ropes attached together
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 20:21:59 Someone should replicate die in plane crazy <:lmfao:527971550360633393> <:fingergun:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 22:36:14 Sicko mode or Obama
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:42:25 ive ran out of things to create in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:42:52 quitted
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:43:19 well its later than the last time i played plane crazy, usually my ideas start popping up at night, so maybe its better now
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:58:40 you know
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:58:55 we have a rope constraint
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:59:04 we have a suspension constraint
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:59:25 we should have a WELD constraint so that i dont have to limit my warp drives in order to keep them from glitching and dying
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 05:59:43 that way i can give people who get too close to my base INCREASED die
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 06:19:46 why dont the guns work anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:52:01 We even have north Koreans in America
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:52:27 We got them mexicos
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:53:03 We got them caramel Bois too
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:55:41 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:55:57 Needs them fidget spinner to keep them stable
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:56:43 Mine are in grade 11
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:57:22 There's no grade gluteus maximus
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:58:12 NEIN
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 15:59:26 Yes

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:12:18 Sorry
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:13:41 Looks like a gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:29:10 I remember, in a discord that I was a moderator in, the bot maker made a bot mention everyone who isn't verified when someone does a command. ___ANYBODY___ could do the command
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:29:29 Let's just say, a lot more people either verified or left, both wins
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:29:43 And there wasn't a cool down
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:30:08 I got a group of people to spam the command, and we were allowed to and there were probably several thousand pings that day
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:37:33 The first living thing to die must have been like "I don't wanna go"
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:38:39 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:44:40 I made a UFO using a magnet drive, so it's a true UFO
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 22:34:35 I remember when the half blocks and stuff were off set by .2 and that broke my reloadable rail gun so i decided to remake it and it was even hotter and then Richard fixed it and the reloader I deleted would have been fixed and the one I just made broke
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 22:34:45 Hoot thymes
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 23:46:01 Richard should invent ban so that disgusting things like that guy can begone
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:31:09 i made a little box of subatomic particles
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:31:11 https://gyazo.com/e7c191e98667d989cee508bf731b7ce0
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:31:21 its actually a big box but dont worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:33:23 i didnt add the strong nuclear force yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:33:30 also i dont have neutrons
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:33:55 also their magnetic pull is kinda wonky so im fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:35:03 but it sorta works
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 06:35:11 and i have an idea on how to make it work
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 15:40:10 It's fackin snowin here
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 15:40:19 And it's the thicc snow too
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 15:40:36 The kind that breaks and falls apart when it hits you
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 15:40:37 Smh
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 15:40:41 I hate snow
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 18:01:59 I just witnessed a genius
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 18:03:40 The snow is big and fluffy where I am, and I saw someone using a leaf blower to blow the snow off the side walk
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 18:12:33 <@456226577798135808> that's the autosave slot. It always autosaves there. Never save stuff there
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 18:17:03 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:11:11 Can't wait to get home to update my little box of subatomic particles so that heat is a thing, the strong nuclear force, and actually make the magnetic forces work
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:12:01 Maybe electron orbits and stuffs too
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:36:53 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:42:46 When you're home alone do you ever just slap your own ass
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:43:20 Because I like to motivate myself
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:43:49 Is a question
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:44:59 No it was made by my friend wicky
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 19:46:26 It's a girl
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:07:34 Ello
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:13:47 During gym class today, we were doing the pledge and we were in the hallway walking to the gym so there wasn't a flag nearby, so a group of guys pledged to a sticker of the flag in the coach's office's door.
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:41:53 Where I am, it's been snowing for 6 hours, and it's those big snow flakes, the ones that fall apart when they hit you. And it's supposed to only get worse. tommorow it's supposed to be extremely cold
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:41:57 Omega sad
plane-crazy 2019-02-09 06:13:31 i just thought
plane-crazy 2019-02-09 06:15:05 albert einstein said "imagination is more important than knowledge"(not word for word). but i think knowledge is more important than imagination, because having knowledge lets us pass that knowledge on to people until somebody with a good enough imagination comes along and builds upon that knowledge.
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 06:57:17 i got my second MMR vaccine today, so when i turn 3 i wont automatically die
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 06:57:18 hell yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 07:05:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 04:46:37 there are 3 genders
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 04:46:38 male
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 04:46:39 female
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 04:46:42 and e-mail

plane-crazy 2019-02-11 06:22:40 what kind of block is that
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 06:22:41 lego
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 19:34:28 I don't mean to get political or anything but why the hell isnt the Horn's pitch changeable?
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 19:35:24 SMH Richard
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 20:42:58 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 20:43:17 I got a neat little gift from the office because my history teacher said I was neat
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 20:43:25 I'm just a quiet boi tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 21:38:33 you know what would be cool?

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 16:07:18 The die is real
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:04:58 If logic gates ever get added, that will make creations far more interresting

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 19:56:07 Valentine's day is tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 19:56:17 This year I'm not alone
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 19:56:54 Technically I have a valentine if the penguin guy in the other discord says yes but if he doesn't then rip me
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 19:57:18 They don't need to know who the Valentine was they just need to know I had one
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:04:37 That's why they should make planes illegal
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:05:57 Shut the up
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:34:02 If you could divide one by zero, that would mean you could multiply 1/0 by zero and get one. But since anything multiplied by 0 is 0, what if we multiply it by 1 divided by infinity <:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:34:55 Ah of course
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:42:07 I should try to make a calculator in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:42:43 I saw a video where a guy used marbles to calculate addition
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 20:43:28 Yeah, I'll try something else with plane crazy

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 15:33:02 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 15:33:21 What if
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 15:33:25 Richard added
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 15:33:37 Even bigger engines? <:HMMMM:535171057649188865>

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 16:58:42 How is your video card so bad that it crashes when playing Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 16:59:00 That's more of a struggle computer than a potato with wifi
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 18:04:44 Pushing suspension using a piston produces acceleration
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 18:04:46 Somehow

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 20:01:54 Ginuous
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 02:12:02 i made a calculator that can add all the way from 0+0, ALL THE WAY to 1+1
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 02:12:06 :D
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 02:12:22 1 bit processing down, 7 more bits to go
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:51:30 Question for admins:
We know we can't say the n word, but can we say "N word"
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:51:44 I wouldn't but I'm just curious
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:51:52 N words
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:51:54 Oh mk
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:52:18 Yeah I won't say the n word but can I say "n word"
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 19:52:31 Like; "ayyy waddup my n word"
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:15:56 I'm making an 8-bit calculator
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:16:26 So far I got the first bit done, so it can add 0+0, 0+1, or 1+1
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:18:08 Using balls as signals to go through the logic gates is a bit of a problem though, since I need multiple balls representing the same thing in order to go through all of the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:19:48 Slowly plane crazy is getting more stuff to make creations more interesting, maybe soon they will add logic gate blocks and sensers so that we can automate flight
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:20:01 And other things
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:37:42 Fun fact: 2 and a half months until Richards name is changed to Rachel if he doesn't add logic Gates and sensers
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 01:27:38 im making an 8 bit calculator and i've finished the and gate and the xor gate
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 01:27:43 the and gate is the smaller one
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 01:29:05 so far i can add 2, 1 bit bytes
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 01:29:15 so 0+0, 1+0, 0+1, or 1+1

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:33:54 Explain how I got the super Sonic role then bb grill
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:34:10 No
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:34:25 Richard let's you do magnet drives on purpose
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:34:31 So it's not a glitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:56:14 It goes faster if you know what you're doing
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:56:41 Maybe use ballast blocks and put them on the lowest density and use that as the planes structure
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 15:57:04 Maybe a helium block or 2 to make it completely weightless

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:49:51 Logic Gates first, mouse blocks later
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:58:11 When the colonists get to Mars, I wonder what opportunity will look like when they find it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:59:02 I can imagine it half burried is Martian dust
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:59:33 Probably not destroyed, it's designed to handle lots of dust
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:59:40 I cant
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:59:43 Am at school
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 15:59:56 Ew
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:07:07 Looks pretty decent
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:07:12 Better than I could do
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:07:48 I'm better with fucking around with plane c razy's blocks and see what I can do
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:09:54 I've discovered that the faster you go, the less wings you want because at such high speeds, wings produce so much lift that they glitch you out
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:10:31 Which is why my fastest plane only has two single wide wings holding the back to the front
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:10:40 It goes 3400 easy
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:12:21 I use magnet drives
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:12:28 Which is why my plane is so smol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 16:13:37 I wonder how fast you could go just using propeller blades
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:10:17 The flat earthers are probably just trolls. The best kind of troll is one that doesn't let people know that they aren't serious

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:11:15 Ah of course
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:11:26 It's just Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:11:50 Roblox hired some really skilled builders to add a lot of detail to this game
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:13:13 Flat Earth society vs fat earth society
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:13:29 Aka round
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 17:14:11 I don't think that's how it works
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:04:10 Wiw
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:04:19 I actually did somewhat decent in gym today
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:04:25 I'm proud of myself
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:14:52 Impressive
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:04:23 I was going to make a calculator but it's difficult. Possible, but difficult, since I can't duplicate balls, and since suspension logic Gates are bulky
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:04:29 Ooh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:04:36 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:04:44 You underestimate the power of autism
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:05:21 Smh Richard, I'll find a way
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:05:29 How thicc is the door?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:05:37 Only a stud?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:06:00 I can't in at school
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:06:04 Frikkin time zones
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:06:20 I get my phone during class because I'm a good boy and get my stuff's done early
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:07:30 While you're here Richard, any estimated date on when you will start the rewrite of plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:12:10 Richard origami fat
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:13:02 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:13:38 No his nickname is rickje
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:14:50 How did people glitch in there already
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:10 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:12 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:13 Smh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:31 Thought it was a challenge to glitch in there
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:44 Yeah Richard abused admin to break into a for idden area
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:49 Demote him
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:52 Fire him
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:15:57 Send him to prison
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:16:27 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:20:22 My friend is threatening to sue his friend for stealing his red pen.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:20:24 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 20:41:50 Richard do you have any estimated time when you will start on the plane crazy rewrite?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 21:40:13 Bug fixes and new bugs to fuck around with
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:31:54 **Hel**lo **p**eople, **m**ay i say, w**e** are having wonderfully **crocodile** free weather.
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:52:39 i mean tbh it looks kinda cuter
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:18 i mean yeah you didnt even bother giving me credit, saying you only took inspiration for the face
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:32 but congratz on making it look a little bit cuter but also a bit rougher
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:36 np
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:58 but try to make it better than my design
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:54:28 mine or his
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:54:43 k
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:54:56 thanks for the compliment
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:55:16 but i kinda also took inspiration after i saw a guy build an oof rammer
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:55:27 <:fingergun:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:55:31 child
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:55:34 way ahead of you
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:56:00 saying child souinds mean
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:56:01 sorry
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:57:11 but yes i already made a walking oofer
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:57:16 i call this one the cursed 00fer
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:57:17 https://gyazo.com/fb4fb030cf1895aaab3a2ae03d64f3a4
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:58:21 i also tried making a sub 00fer but apparently propeller blades produce just as much force in water as in air, except increased resistance
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:58:33 so i gave up because it made me sad that i couldnt make it look good
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:04:38 yeah, thats what the white parts on the side are
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:13:09 
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:13:13 
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:13:15 i want to believe
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:14:39 is there a better way to auto stabilize than wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:15:00 the amount of wings make this thing pretty laggy i think
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:15:10 either that or the magnets have gotten a lot laggier some how
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:44:31 Richard may be a slow work boi but he's a hard work boi
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:48:32 Lmaono
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:52:17 **damn, the earth looking awfully flat from up there**
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:53:22 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:54:00 Aight let me reword that because the bots have stupid
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:54:16 That's the uuhhh atmosphere making the earth look round
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 15:55:52 Wrong bb grill it's flat because it looks flat
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 16:08:35 Bruh_Sound_Effect.wav
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 16:09:08 That's racist
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 16:09:17 Extra racist because it has another k
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 16:09:48 Incorrect that's not how names work
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 16:10:21 Kool kids klan klub
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 17:03:44 My god
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 17:04:02 Somebody in the halls just called someone "thiccolas"
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 18:05:30 Richards name is now Thiccard
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:45:47 Richard you should do competitions. Not just building competitions but competitions are at actual challenges
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:45:52 Like fastest stable flier
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:46:10 Oh wait I forgot I name was changed to thiccard
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:40:18 His name is Richard
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:40:22 Thiccard*
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:40:49 Nicholas
Thiccolas
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:41:23 Thiccje
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:34:22 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:34:26 heck yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:34:30 you got a better view
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:55:50 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:55:53 lagginess 💯
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:56:06 dont mind the noob lurking in the back
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:56:10 its perfectly normal
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:56:34 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:04:04 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:04:05 dear god
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:07:31 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:11:13 >Plane doesnt have any engines
<:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:11:51 skid is short for Script Kiddie
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:11:55 how is he a skid
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:12:14 oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:12:23 oh i read that completely incorrectly
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:12:25 my b
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:18:59 we sank like 9 of them
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:19:01 mind changed
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:19:22 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:21:02 correction, <@456226577798135808> we sank 10 of them
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:21:16 and claimed 1, which we used to test a nuclear bomb on
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:23:51 so in conclusion, the japanese are great at one thing out at sea, making sushi
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:24:00 id say that makes up for all of their war crimes
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:24:21 but then anime, but that was technically our fault for leaving comic books behind which inspired anime
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:25:06 hot
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:25:18 HAWT
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:25:40 iq 700
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:26:11 go ahead
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:26:14 we're not stopping you
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:26:35 tbh its better than i can do
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:26:37 rip shinx
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:27:25 i wonder if im the only guy whose gotten supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:28:22 i have the supersonic role
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:28:31 warp drive is nice
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:28:55 but supersonic requires actual engineering, since center of pressure stuff and things and what nots
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:29:13 and FRICKIN RICHARD hasnt added non lifting wing panels yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:29:17 thiccard*
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:29:47 also for some reason magnet drives are laggy again
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:48:34 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:48:36 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:48:43 <:HMMMM:535171057649188865>
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:14:26 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 15:42:18 Before my interdimentional fidget spinner was interdimentional or a fidget spinner, it was a propeller blade, then I realized that the warp drives are probably strong enough that without the blades, it would spin fast enough to give any creation instant die. So I tried that, it worked, but I wanted did to go FASTER, so I upgraded the warp drives and it went so fast that the springs couldn't hold together anymore, and glitched and when it glitched it was so powerful that if it managed to hit a creation, said creation would either pop out of existence or be flung across the map.
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 15:50:52 Oh and rickje's real name is Richard or Thiccard if you're feeling extra spicy so it's preferred you call him that
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 16:14:54 Well yeah we aren't robots
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 16:15:04 We have lives to spend not always developing
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 16:19:19 Dead meme
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 16:19:39 Big die
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 17:05:40 Ned is short for nedward
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 17:59:53 4 times 10 is he same as 4 10 times
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 20:42:46 BEES
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 20:43:10 THERES FACKIN **BEES**
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:26:42 i cant wait until we get more stuff
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:27:10 right now it would be pretty difficult, but possible, for me to build a calculator
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:27:17 but the more variety of resources we get
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:27:25 the better the things we can make
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:27:55 do flying aircraft carriers count?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:27:58 if so
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:04 i have a solid proposition for you
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:05 aw
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:19 oh realistic battle
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:20 sad
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:45 idk how to build high detail real life things
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 08:28:59 shut the up fat

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 20:14:22 the green one witht hte beard and yellow/red glasses
bug-reports 2019-02-24 04:47:47 when you try to put the ballast density at 1.15 it changes to 1.14
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:43:31 if the internet has taught me anything its that girls dont exist and the ones that claim they do are probably dudes.
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:44:58 sounds like something a dude would say
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:45:36 nah b theyre
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:45:38 uuuuhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:40:31 No, I mean me
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:40:44 I speak English good, is my first language
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:40:52 But sometimes be forget which way s goes
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:41:26 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:41:51 You ever just forget to english
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:42:26 I learned a Spanish the last 2 years
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:42:43 Soi me llamo verde
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:43:03 I got a D in them, passing by only 2 percent
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:43:06 Does it show
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:43:43 I already finished spanish
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:44:17 Just curious, are you fluent in Spanish or do you no comprendo when mister guy englishes bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 20:44:57 I meant english
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 15:44:58 Richard should add buttons, so that when something touches the button it activates a thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 15:56:15 I just looked at <#544022464133595166>, are other people not allowed to get super Sonic engineer anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 16:55:31 Remember that time that motors weren't broken?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 16:55:35 Yeah me neither
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:01:55 You know those plagues that schools get on occasion, where on Friday like 3% of people are sick but then on Monday about 95% of people are sick
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:02:02 My school just got one of those
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:02:06 Frikkin succs
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:13:24 Why is that 777 so longg
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:15:52 Fun
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:16:09 I used to dig holes in the back yard until my mom said to stop
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:16:22 You can't get it anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:16:42 With super Sonic you make a plane that can be maneuvered at super sonic speeds
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:16:59 With light speed you put a bunch of helium together
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 18:17:09 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 20:07:53 Roblox should make an advanced physics mode. The basic physics for games that don't really care, and the advanced physics for games like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 20:08:09 Advanced physics would be a bit laggier though
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 20:08:12 Probably
the-dump 2019-02-27 20:18:58 I remember when I got my wisdom teeth out and I was still high af from them nice dental juices I tried talking on discord and I made so many spelling mistakes
the-dump 2019-02-27 21:15:28 No it's the loading gif gif
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:31:28 Scripting isn't hard
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:31:35 Tf you talking about <:omegalul:528987216643489792>
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:31:54 Well that's the scripters fault
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:32:33 Might be better to just rescript the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:33:02 I would but they probably wouldn't let me and I have my own projects
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:34:53 Proveia
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:34:57 My guy
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:35:09 Shut your hell the down
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:27 Free models bot your game to the top?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:29 DEAL
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:45:14 Are intellectuals arguing again
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:45:55 **E**
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:53:17 F22 has the biggest number, that's why it's the most commonly built
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 03:38:24 turning 18 is just your free subscription to life expiring
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 03:40:06 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:42:52 Can Mr. Nature get their wife, she's dumping way too much snow on us.
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:43:46 What
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:44:18 Lõñgê
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:46:06 Löñgüë
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:46:32 When Richard adds logic Gates I'm gonna make a calculator first
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:46:54 Also why is your pfp Stalin
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:47:09 AAAA
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:47:40 Oh mk
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:50:06 It's best
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:50:45 Fun
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 15:50:53 Tubular
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 16:01:56 Oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 16:01:58 A worm
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 16:39:48 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 17:12:38 When Richard makes the plane crazy rewrite, he should have a bindable event for the creation for inputs, so either the user input can make inputs, or the creations blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 17:12:50 That way logic Gates and stuff can happen easily
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 17:12:57 And sensers
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 19:12:44 Fun fact:
(1/0)*0=1
Which is why mathematicians don't let you divide by zero.
If you do, then they show up to your house and multiply you by 0.
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:10:33 I'm sad
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:11:29 I have to do a 2-3 page essay on whether the Salem witch trials, the red scare, or the Japanese internment camps caused the most mistreatment of human people
general 2019-02-28 20:20:16 People In hgh school, do people at your school call people who are on the debate team "master debaters" as well or is that just mine
general 2019-02-28 20:43:07 Yeah that's the point
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:48:53 Latch more like hatch
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:48:57 Increased funny
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 20:55:14 Taych
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:12:28 yatch
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:34:47 Lmao, people at my table group were talking about scholarships, and one girl said she could get one for having red hair and blue eyes. And then the guy across from me says "I wonder if I can go to Germany and get a scholarship for being Aryan" lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 00:07:37 why do the motors move even though they arent active and are locked?
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 00:08:17 richard
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 00:08:20 the heck
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 15:52:11 That's disturbing
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 19:44:26 Buttons
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:19:05 They are stored in a datastore
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:19:11 He will use the same datastores
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:19:59 When you live at school because your mom doesn't have enough money for gas
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:33:52 The past tense of theft is thooft
general 2019-03-01 20:43:01 Too much water
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:50:35 Looks like suspension
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:51:06 Suspension?
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 20:56:41 Watch out they're about to Allahu Ackbar
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:14:58 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:15:00 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:15:07 That actually looks really convincing lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:15:55 What a thicc chonky boy
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 03:32:31 luckily none of my friends have sunken to such low peasantry as the likes of 🆎ortnite
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 03:33:45 im pretty sure roblox does that for you
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 03:34:52 roblox was actually a physics simulation engine where you could show your buddy boys what you did with it and then david bazooka decided "ay why not make it into a game engine"
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 03:35:13 who?
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 03:35:25 oh yeah hes fat lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 07:23:13 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 07:23:27 its the chinese knock off of sandra
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:52:52 why are cats so happy to ignore people
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:53:30 i wonder if it take effort, because its rude to look at cats, or if they dont care enough to care
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:53:41 cats are still great though
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:54:09 oh, youre chinese?
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:55:14 i prefer cats. cats are happy, proud little murderers. have you ever seen a cat with a freshy caught mouse?
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 07:55:48 well sorry that you arent good at looking after your cats
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 16:49:21 Remember kids
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 16:49:25 Fix motor
general 2019-03-04 16:53:12 Fun fact: simulators are fucking stupid, they aren't even simulators they are just renamed cookie clickers where you have a limit of what you can click
general 2019-03-04 18:04:25 We're fine with it
general 2019-03-04 18:05:02 We don't like football now because it's associated with the atrocity that was the super bowl this year
general 2019-03-04 18:05:53 We would be fine with football of they didn't cut off sweet victory with sicko mode
general 2019-03-04 18:05:56 Like tf
general 2019-03-04 18:07:00 Cut off a meme that was meant to commemorate the creator of SpongeBob with a song that's a meme for being so bad
general 2019-03-04 18:07:36 Yeah
general 2019-03-04 18:07:45 That's why sweet victory became a meme
general 2019-03-04 18:07:57 We meme the people of out childhood who die
general 2019-03-04 18:08:03 It's the new way of respect
general 2019-03-04 18:08:33 Those emojis are so bad
general 2019-03-04 18:08:36 Jesus
general 2019-03-04 18:09:14 Even... Oh god I'm about to say it... even owo isn't as bad as ";H;"
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 22:22:44 <#529858892075761694> cool
START THR FRIKKIN REWRITE REEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 22:23:43 In <#507673335816126509> we voted to pause all development and start the frikkin rewrite so start the **FR**ikkin rewrite
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:36:27 Usually it's the prettiest planes that win the contest, not the most impressive
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:36:32 Makes me sad
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:40:11 I can't wait to go to college so I can spend my monie dollars on nothing but cream cheese and crackers
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:40:16 Will be great
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:40:54 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:41:23 That's why you need to do something cool with it
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:41:49 We all do buddy man
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:43:05 If you're the best with magnet drives, then why don't you have super Sonic rank B)
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:44:20 Kran
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 18:10:40 It's easy considering they're broken
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 18:11:28 I made a think that spins using magnet drives
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 18:11:38 Spins so fast that you can almost see your mom
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:48:16 
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:48:20 looks like impersonation but okay
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 02:20:06 oh god i was just looking at your name for a solid 7 seconds hella confused because i thought i was in a discord server i left 7 months ago <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:48:37 ?ban <@192861290677534722>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:54:43 Hopefully once Richard is done with the parachute blocks and whatever he's working on, he will start the rewrite so that I don't have to change his name to Rachel when April comes
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:55:24 No that wouldn't make sense
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:55:47 Rick is short for Richard and Richard is long for Rachel
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:55:54 Mad is big mak
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 15:56:19 Because hes doing the most work
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:13:52 A black guy said to me "ay, (my name), my (**N word**), you're looking slick!" And it made me feel nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:14:33 Roblox is full of 12 year olds, of course we will cyberbully everyone
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:14:47 Even the older players will encourage the Cyber bullying for entertainment
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:14:52 It's like rhino beetle fights
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:15:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:15:44 Fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:16:33 Skip school while you can! In high school missing a single day puts you back a week unless you have some Asian witchcraft to maintain your As
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:17:57 It's not racist, it's controversial
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:19:42 Red dot is a national logo
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:19:46 You're Japanese?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:20:00 Lard
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:20:39 Fatt
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:21:00 Idk how much I weigh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:21:05 130 or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:21:34 Hah noob
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:21:40 I'm 69 years old
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:21:46 You're a noob compared to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 17:09:46 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 17:14:07 Too late
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 17:14:21 I already created the interdimentional fidget spinner <@327499289595084800>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 18:54:03 Was that opposite day?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 18:54:24 Weeb makes everything bad infinite
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 20:15:50 Flame thrower
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 20:41:54 Are you allowed to say the n word of you're south African?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 22:33:24 RICHARD WHY DO YOU ALWAYS TEST WHEN IM AT SCHOOL
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 22:33:35 Makes me Omega sad
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 22:33:41 PST
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 22:34:48 Contest, how fast can you go with 2 deployed parachutes and only 50 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:47:59 
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 15:49:12 The Egyptians had the right idea worshipping cats as gods.
creations-chat 2019-03-07 16:13:52 You can make hover boards with a jet engine and some wings
creations-chat 2019-03-07 16:14:06 You step on the wings to control the hover board
creations-chat 2019-03-07 16:14:17 The jet engine points straight up obviously
help 2019-03-07 16:27:13 Like
help 2019-03-07 16:27:15 10
help 2019-03-07 16:27:36 Even though it should only lift about .333
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:52:01 Richard frikkin LPGIC GATES OR YOUR NAME WILL BE CHANGED TO RACHEL
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:16 Richard, logic gates gonna happen any time soon or nahhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:54:59 Richard why egg nore
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:55:41 Richard why do you ignore my questions
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:19 So no?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:38 You were doing the rewrite so I don't know if you're planning on adding the logic gates soon or not
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:47 Mk
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:00 Ooh co pilot
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:04 Aight worth the wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:31 Logic gates could have a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:39 So more people would use it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:54 I know a 7 year old who can script
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:58:02 10 year olds can learn logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:58:36 Richard, I know a 7 year old who can script
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:58:54 Logic Gates are literally just "if this and this then that"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:58:58 Should be simple
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:59:04 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:00:24 Also while doing the rewrite for the logic Gates, you should allow multi-letter inputs/outputs so we can have more channels that don't interfere with eachother
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:00:36 Mk
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:01:35 The logic Gates aren't needed, but if you want to make complex, neat things you would need to learn logic Gates, which, if they want to learn, literally even 9 year olds will be able to learn logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:01:53 I didn't say they shouldn't be added
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:02:00 I said that to make something you don't need them
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:02:11 They just make things neater
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:02:45 Oöf
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:03:06 Data compression could help with save data stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:03:54 How much does one key I take up in memory?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:04:32 A single letter takes up 6 to 50 bytes
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:05:05 What does a key save look like in memory?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:05:23 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:05:30 What would the string look like
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:05:36 Maybe you could optimize it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:05:58 Mk
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:27:42 I'm about to say the N word
MRS OBAMA GET DOWN
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:36:17 I wonder if you can use the parachutes as a form of lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:41:22 Richard needs to decrease helium weight tbh. One block lifts like 5 normal blocks, when in reality it should only be able to lift .5 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:44:14 Boi
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:44:25 Just search "from rickje"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:44:31 Or pin
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:52:23 Why
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:15:57 Mufasa
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:15:59 Nooooo
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:17:07 Morse
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:40:29 Don't you hate not Englishing well?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:11:52 no theyre knee pads
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:39:57 i just learned that most chinese think that foreigners cant understand chinese culture because of its complexity and think theyre superior
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:40:07 jesus and people say white people are racist lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 06:57:52 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 06:57:53 help
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:45:50 Imagine going to heaven and then you hear god say "deport him to hell"
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:10:03 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:10:52 Richard, are you going to add control authority to the control surfaces any thyme soon or nahhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:34:12 It's getting a rewrite
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:34:18 He's rewriting smol bits
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:34:30 Because you broke the rules
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:35:01 Discord is an American company and in anerica not even the government can break the rules
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:35:12 Not sure which one you broke but oh well
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:35:18 Didn't see the message
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:35:57 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:36:05 Also who would use fuel blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:36:28 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:36:39 Why use the fuel blocks if you can make fuel infinite
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:37:14 Maybe fuel tanks could be required in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:37:38 But who needs fuel when you can drive a magnet
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:37:40 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:38:11 I'm already quite experienced with magnet drives
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:38:32 Duh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:40:07 I wish the air resistance wasn't so bad.
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:46:44 I forgot, os there an air resistance property in workspace?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:56:10 Ar m80
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:56:14 You be correct
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:57:19 Froized*
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:58:33 If Richard is reading this, he should Nerf helium from being able to lift like 5 blocks to .5
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:59:05 We dooo
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:59:14 Buuuut I don't think it's worthy
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:01:47 Can't wait for co pilot and stuff so that my friend can shoot people who are trying to eat me
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:02:31 I'm just gonna magnet my drives
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:03:39 Just curious, when explosive blocks are shot or exploded, do they explode?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:10:04 Imagine when we get logic gates, I would be able to make self aiming missiles that will be really accurate
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:10:06 Heck yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:10:39 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:10:54 Sensors are coming with logic gates i would imagine
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:11:07 Or they would at least come quickly in succession
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:11:53 Hot key logic would be a part of it. But come on, you can't think about adding logic gates without adding sensors
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:12:21 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:12:33 It's obvious
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:12:50 Its like an untold rule
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:13:01 You don't need to talk about it for it to be obvious
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:14:28 Also can't wait for increased build space so I can build even bigger noobs and more complex stuffs
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:16:43 Richard said the rewrite would add bigger plots
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:16:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:21:48 When bigger plots are added I'm going to make a centipede noob
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:23:59 I hope that Roblox improves collision detection in the future so I can make a really fast shooting gun with a lot of rounds
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:24:42 Well, I already can make a gun
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:24:59 But a bunch of magnets pushing the bullets down the barrel is a bit inefficient
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 20:37:40 Fun fact: humans have the best stamina and stamina recovery of any animal. That's how they used to hunt, they would chase whatever there is in the Savannah until it gave up and yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:32:37 wait what happened
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:32:44 why are there a bunch of capital letters
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:32:52 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:34:03 maybe big mak sabotaged it because he didnt like the tnt balls because theyre balls and big mak no homo
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:42:09 so is the game not broken anymore
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:42:20 oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:50:17 i mean, of course every block should sink
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:50:22 except ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:50:51 the players dont have to like it by itself, but it will make the game better
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:50:54 so just add it anyways
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:51:25 best walker is mine actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:51:28 its a noob walker
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 07:05:41 ive created this simple missile system which is so easy to control that it can target fast moving planes, and since its simple there are a lot of copiers
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 07:05:46 i dont blame them though
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 07:05:51 ive decided to let them copy
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 07:06:04 in fact im pretending to be afk while this guy copies my rocket
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 07:08:22 <@!99607451300548608> change your name to delicious code so that women are more interested
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 19:52:51 i like the though of blocks that sink
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 19:53:10 i tried building a submarine and i had to fit so many full weight ballasts to make it barely float at all
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 19:53:18 so i gave up on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 19:53:38 especially when i discovered that propellers dont produce additional thrust under water like they should
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:46:27 Richard should bribe roblocks to make the physics simulation better
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:48:45 Fun fact: roblocks started off as a physics simulation thing, where you share your creations with friends to show them what you managed to do
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:50:10 That's why it was called dynablocks, dynamic blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:50:42 Plane crazy isn't a plane construction game, it's a physics breaking game
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:50:48 Er
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:50:57 Roblocks depends on multiple things
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:51:15 Fun, press f9 in game
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:51:25 Then see which area is the most strained
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:51:29 And upgrade that
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:51:48 k
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:53:19 I have a decent computer
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:53:38 I mean it's about 10 years old at least at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:53:48 But it still runs Roblox decently
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 14:54:33 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:05:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:05:30 I forgot what cpu i have but it's like a uuuuhhhhhhhh solid 3.4 giga hertz
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:05:46 But the Hertz isn't what make or breaks a cpu
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:06:07 It also has a lot of threats and I forgot how many cores
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:06:13 Like uuuuhhh 2 at least
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:06:23 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:07:10 The ussr should temporarily come back and take control of the computer companies so we get free computer stuff and then die again
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:08:23 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:09:02 I can't wait to get some monies so I can upgrade my computer
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:19:26 My at least 10 year old computer manages to easily handle max Roblox graphics
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:19:33 So that's nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:29:28 Remember kids:
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:10:44 Remember that time the falcon nein exploded
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:10:48 Looked cool
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:11:19 I have a remote controlled rocket that has an annoying small explosion radius
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:11:22 Is fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:11:42 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:11:50 Well I don't put helium on my rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:11:57 B)
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:13:06 Well when logic gates are added, my rockets will land and/or target things themselves as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:13:22 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:13:45 It's where you can put in 2 inputs and get one output
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:14:05 And gates require 2 true inputs
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:14:16 Or gates require at least 1
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 16:14:24 Xor requires at most 1 and at least 1
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:04:04 The blue is the center of lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:04:16 It's where the wings exert the most force
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:04:41 The center of mass is where your creation would balance
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:08:52 The yellow one, yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 18:20:40 Can we copy strike your mom
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:09:52 Remember that time when the people landed on the moon
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:10:17 I don't, I wasn't born yet
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:10:34 I really hope you don't actually believe it was fake
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:11:07 You're actually serious
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:11:35 What piece of evidence makes you believe they faked it
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:12:08 Not even evidence, why don't you believe in the moon landings
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:12:27 You just said you didnt
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:13:29 Look it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:13:57 Actually I think k it was the Rover taking the picture
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:15:30 Either that or they put the camera there and re enacted the first steps for the public to ser
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:15:32 See*
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:15:39 But I'm pretty sure it was the rover
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:16:27 If they really wanted to fake it, they wouldn't have done something so stupid as film them taking the first steps from a regular camera
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:18:39 I looked it up, the ship had a pole that had a camera attached to the end to record it
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:24:10 Eh we will be back to the moon soon enough to prove that the lander's little launch pad thing is still there
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 19:38:21 Oh fuck the black plague is invading oh shit oh fuck https://www.roblox.com/catalog/21070037/Louie
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:44:57 Probably
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:45:47 I want to build something new but I've already made a flying oofer, cursed(walker) oofer, and a submarine oofer didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:46:19 Also not much left to do with warp drives
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:46:32 I could try to get super Sonic again
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:46:42 I still have it but I might as well try
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:47:33 But it's kind of difficult. We don't have non lifting wing panels, and even the smallest of co trol surfaces are too stronk at those speeds
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:47:37 Omega sad
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:48:43 When logic gates and sensors are added, that will make things more interesting.
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:52:02 But not dont
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 14:52:36 Once it's done you should fly it in a pvp server so people can shoot it down
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 16:10:25 A plane can't be too heavy, it just doesn't have enough wings and engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 16:10:58 Oh yeah and Richard needs to add non lifting wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 16:11:08 And reverse lifting wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:01:22 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:01:38 There's a lot more behind the scenes code there
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:01:47 Like the gravity function
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:16:37 Imagine in the far future, we have team pvp matches
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:16:41 Will be fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 17:18:03 You could probably make an anti aircraft gun by making a shell with a bunch of balls and then exploding it close to the plane, scattering the bombs
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:11:08 Richard, add the frikkin reverse lifting wing panels. Also non lifting wing panels would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:11:32 Wait how do the normal wings actually decide where to lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:12:32 They do, Richard nerfed their liftability about an update ago
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:12:56 What
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:13:13 You said you nerfed their lifting and that's why my noob couldn't fly
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:14:28 No tlnot recently
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 18:14:33 When my noob stopped workng
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 20:36:22 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 20:39:43 Rickje is really good at making games, he should be a dev for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 20:41:35 Richard fixed something?
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 20:41:37 What?
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 21:35:55 Help someone just swear worded at me
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 21:36:13 I'm telling my mom oh my god
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 21:36:43 She said she's calling the police
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 22:38:27 madattak seems like a really good dev, he should make his own development group
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 23:12:03 air resistance in roblox is bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 23:12:08 too much resistance
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:43:15 what is the speed of sound in SPS again?
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:44:31 i think the speed of sound in sps is 6870 sps
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:44:41 so im 1/6th of the way there
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:49:27 alright, now im half the way to super sonic. but the horizontal center of pressure is a bit too much at 3000 sps
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 15:09:40 East? I thought you said Weast.
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 15:10:44 **why doesn't anybody get that reference**
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 15:11:10 **is the world filled with uncultured peasantry**
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 16:11:19 Oh fuck the midgets found me
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 16:11:21 Help
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 18:06:17 I'm trying to make a supersonic plane. I would be able to, but Roblox's air drag is bad and puts too much drag on the wings, causing the plane to sway back and forth
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 18:06:59 So I have to make a really big plane so that it's not so sensitive. But even big planes get wobbly at those speeds from a SINGLE 1X1 DELTA WING
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 18:08:39 So far it can get up to 3000 sps before the wobble starts messing it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 18:12:54 Maybe Richard can do some fancy script stuff to lower the drag a bit. You can't lower it directly, but you can apply a force on the wings proportional to the speed on the direction it's moving so that it feels like it doesn't have ad much drag
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 18:13:20 I'll put it in suggestions
general 2019-03-13 18:56:22 How to commit cancer
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:29:29 Does it have rifling
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:29:45 Then it's bad bt default
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:29:52 By*
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:30:10 Because it won't be able to hit something 30 feet away
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:31:52 I made a quick firing machine gun that shoots about 40 balls in a second

plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:33:54 Petition for Richard to ban furries
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:35:14 I don't see any rule already in place against furries
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:35:23 So why did you ask if I read the rules
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:35:53 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:36:03 And uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:36:07 What
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:36:56 Rule one is a maybe, rule 12, I'm not being an annoyance, in being civil
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:37:26 The rule is if you are annoying towards everyone, a general annoyance
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:37:42 So I can't just say madattak is annoying to me and get him banned
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:38:25 Furries aren't a race or something they cant control
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:39:58 Just most
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:40:14 My sister is a furry as well, she's good
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:40:45 But if furries are allowed, they could cause others to become furies, which isn't good
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:41:21 I guess
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:43:10 There are more furries in this server than I thought
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:43:28 It's becoming like my old server
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:43:30 Oh god
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:44:08 eeeAeeee what
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 20:03:56 Being poor is bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 20:05:54 There is an inflow of robucc and an outflow of robucc, inflow being buying them directly, or builders club. An outflow being taxes, groups, namechanges, and of course dev exvhange

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:54:46 Are fuel tanks going to get lighter as fuel runs out?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:55:11 Tempted to ping Richard
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:56:08 Hopefully fuel transfer is also a thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:56:27 So I can exploit the mechanics
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:56:38 And make an infinite thrust drive
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:56:43 You will see
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:56:47 You will all see
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:57:40 Just give me a transfer fuel ability and make Fuller tanks heavier and trust me buddy man I will make an infinite thrust drive

plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:27:04 Idk, never tested it before getting rid of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:27:50 It has ropes, and ot has ballasts, it spins fast, and it goes towards where I'm akming
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:28:00 It would work if there was a helicopter around
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:28:46 Wish I got to test it, I was planning on testing it on Richards helicopter but he hasn't spawned ot since old pvp mode was removed
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:29:31 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:29:51 I specialize in magnet drives

plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:30:13 But luckily he stopped messing with the magnets recently
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:30:37 I also made a cruise missiles holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:34:37 I got to name our group in American literature

plane-crazy 2019-03-19 19:37:23 Sure why not
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:23:28 looks like male genitalia
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 14:57:05 <:mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:13:27 System32 is a redundant program, nobody has any use for it anymore since it was used for dialup internet, and it causes a lot of lag and takes up a lot of memory
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:13:52 So it's best to delete it
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:49:40 I wonder how you can get a Michael P mic
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:50:31 Bruh.wav skribbl.io is a knockoff of Roblox draw guess games
general 2019-03-20 15:52:56 Idk why, but at night, when I'm about to fall asleep, I suddenly jerk awake startled because it felt like i wasn't breathing
general 2019-03-20 15:53:58 Happened until 4:00am at which point I said "fuck it idc if I forget to breathe in my sleep and die"
general 2019-03-20 15:54:44 Luckily I didnt
general 2019-03-20 15:54:49 I know
general 2019-03-20 15:54:59 But it feels like I'm not breathing and i jerk awake
general 2019-03-20 15:55:15 It's weird
general 2019-03-20 15:55:32 I wouldn't actually sleep if I knew I had a chance of dying lol
general 2019-03-20 15:55:52 But it was just nyeeehhhhHHh
general 2019-03-20 16:00:08 Tf is that
general 2019-03-20 16:00:38 Raddish?
general 2019-03-20 16:00:43 Turnip
general 2019-03-20 16:00:47 It's a turnip
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 16:03:14 Bruh.wav I don't mean to get religious or anything what the fuck is Roblox CEO rank?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 17:01:24 Try immobile
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 17:02:01 PC master race where you at?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 18:56:02 Yeah them marijuanos
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 01:22:10 i dont play 🆎ortnite
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 01:30:38 i got on roblox when my brother told me about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 01:30:48 yee
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 01:31:07 so i first played roblox in 2008, and made my first account in 2009
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:14:28 these noobs making articulately detailed aircraft smh
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:14:41 im struggling with the REAL challenge
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:14:48 **dealing with roblox's physics engine**
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:16:53 i tried making explosive ammo to shoot down planes, but the aerodynamics from roblox's physics engine isnt enough to have realistic flight
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:18:25 also
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:18:29 supersonic planes
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:18:33 easily possible
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:19:37 but the wing panels produce so much drag/resistance than with massive planes having a single 1x1 wedge out of place will cause your entire plane to wiggle and go unstable
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:20:42 i havent been able to make a super sonic plane yet, since when i get up to around 3000, the tiniest bit of wing panel behind the center of mass makes it unstable
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:21:12 i have to use delta wings on the center of mass to make sure that the center of pressure is a bit futher behind
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 04:21:14 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:24:32 it has tracks for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:24:34 fat
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:24:41 fool
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:24:46 the tank IS the turret
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:25:04 yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:25:20 <@456226577798135808> just confirmed to not be 13
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:25:22 ban him
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:25:29 delete him
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:26:20 fun fact: they invented airplanes to uh...
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:26:25 uuhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:27:00 the motors being broken is a feature of plane crazy at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 05:28:07 david bazooka seems like a great entrepreneur he should invest in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 14:44:21 People are suspiciously quiet on this bus
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 14:44:23 If I don't talk within the next hour, it means I entered a boss zone and didn't make it.
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 14:54:15 Peasants trying to make things look practical
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 14:54:45 This is plane crazy, we have a different set of physics and rules, abandon the traditional build
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 14:55:11 Create things that are meant to hold up to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:04:22 I made a missile. It's all manually controlled so it has to turn around several times before hitting the target
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:04:28 Can't wait for logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:07:06 Yes well plane crazy is americanese
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:07:15 So we go with the Americano SPG
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:07:19 Self propelled gun
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:09:33 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:10:17 Motors being broken is a feature of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:11:20 Tiny gaps are the most annoying thing to have to deal with in Roblox studio
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 15:44:56 We wake up too god damn early
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:07:02 I wish we had wing panels that didn't produce lift and had reduced drag so that it's easier to build high-speed things
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:12:55 LMAO that plane taking off from a track and then it's propeller kust slapping the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:44:39 Boat powered man
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:46:56 3th
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:56:29 Uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:56:42 Don't post sentences using so letter messages
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:56:46 That would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:56:53 h
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:57:25 Roblox also took all of the old heads off sale
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:57:28 Why would they
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 17:58:25 Yeah, PewDiePie is only the second largest YouTuber on YouTube, so he's completely irrelevant and nobody cares about him
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:52:22 If an ISP removed you from being able to use the phone, is that denying your right to communicate?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:57:18 Wait, cool, were you asking me?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:58:03 <@381263178589536257>
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:58:42 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:58:54 Wait, schools are planning on making it so you can't make phone calls?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:58:58 Oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 18:59:13 Well I wasn't referring to that
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:01:54 Well that's not good
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:02:49 I mean, teachers could get WiFi detectors to make sure nobody is cheating during tests and stuff. But making phone calls impossible, doesn't seem good
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:03:01 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:03:16 Oh that's good
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:03:25 Was it between 2 students?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:03:43 Oh, just 2 guys walking down the street
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 19:03:46 HmmmMM
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 20:07:16 What the h
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 20:07:20 Eck
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 20:09:17 Inhalers are just cans of diet air
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 20:42:15 Somebody stole my fucking C6H12O6 and triglycerides
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:09:55 not the homosexual gay
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:09:58 just normal gay
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:10:42 homosexual gay is the one where youre homosexual
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:10:53 happy gay is the one where youre happy
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:10:59 insult gay is the one where youre gay
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:11:27 no, homosexual gay means youre homosexual
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:12:06 "homosexual gay" is just clarifying what version of the gay we're talking about
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 00:12:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:56:19 so you can ban people without being in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:56:30 i havent seen that since i worked in that one group
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:56:56 wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:57:06 you just said you dont need to be in-game to punish people
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:57:57 but yeah, i was in a group where they could see everything that everyone was saying in roblox, and ban them from discord
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 04:58:15 it was a group that got a lot of trolls, so remote punishments was nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 05:05:41 changing your online name is so weird like, what do your friends call you
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 16:12:42 I made a rope engine before
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 16:12:46 It was fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 19:08:44 Hah noob
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 19:09:32 Is being half black half white blight or whack?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:34:59 You're asking him?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:35:20 Aren't you the telamon of plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 06:54:05 holy FUCK im tired
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 06:54:21 why am i starting to wake up early and go to bed early as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 06:54:49 im not even old enough to pay taxes yet, let alone be the dad that wakes up at 6 am and falls asleep on the couch in 17 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:27:43 <:mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:28:23 lol fatsicle thats why you dont tell people you hope they die
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:28:27 /e dab
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:28:52 /e tpose
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:29:04 lol no
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 20:29:21 weeb
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:35:00 Is joke
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:35:05 Why u have to be mad
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:35:30 I mean I guess
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:35:34 Heheh border
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:35:36 I get it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:51:07 Is not meme
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:51:12 You think this is a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:51:43 Eeee
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:52:40 There's already a better game than jailbreak, but jailbreak is clinging on trying to stay relevant and delay it's death using cheap, essentially clickbait updates
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:52:51 Mad city is far higher in quality
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:53:25 Mad city has more stuff in it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:54:04 It's called Mad city because that's the guy's... Brand name?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:54:10 Mad paintball
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:54:15 Mad murderer
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:54:30 No, big mak is a different thing guy man
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:54:43 Big Mak
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:55:52 I mean, mad city is better balanced than jail break
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 14:56:23 Guns and friends are actually helpful against police and hero's, since they have to actually kill you to arrest you
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:57:54 I have an idea for a super Sonic creation
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:58:02 Why didn't I think about this before
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:58:08 Just don't out wings on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:58:16 Then I don't need to deal with them
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:58:31 I'll just use rockets to maneuver
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 15:59:52 I'm not a boatologist
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:00:03 Tried making a submarine
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:00:28 Apparently wings don't make more force in water than in air so it kinda didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:01:08 Oh well, making realistic physical in Roblox would be rather difficult
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:01:32 I do better with abusing the weirdness of the game
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:01:34 It's fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:01:53 I make things that can easily go faster than the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:02:03 Also things that spin really fast
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:02:28 I call it the interdimentional fidget spinner because it spins so fast that it goes distorted and glitches out
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:02:42 Baeblade
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:02:44 What
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:03:16 You mean a bayblade? Or did you make a bayblade that looks like a girl so you called ot baeblade
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:04:52 Mk
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:10:14 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:11:11 I've been a mod in several different servers before, I've decided that I want to just be a normal server member for once
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 16:12:05 Besides, this server doesn't seem to need many mods. The community seems actually decent
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:43:51 So are people over 16 mature?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:44:09 Oh fuck o better change my ways before the government returns me to 16 years old
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:44:38 Hehehe
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:44:51 Well I guess since above 16 also counts the 90 year olds
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:44:54 I guess you're right
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:24:38 Homolygous structures
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:29:14 Duh
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:37:19 Turkey is great
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:37:28 It tastes like chicken except gooder
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:38:09 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:38:15 I'm already on stage 4
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:39:04 Remember kids
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:39:20 Duke shall be elliminated
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 19:39:39 Fortnite causes 🆎ortnite
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 23:08:04 the worst part about learning as you go is coming back and destroying the past parts to redo them to lok better
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 23:08:32 looks like a cat
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:01:19 .3.
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:01:38 those are the first words i read when i tabbed back into this chat
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:17:25 i support myself
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:21:39 imagine those lucky people that have roblox game development as their job
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:21:47 not really lucky
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:22:01 hard working and good at copying front page games but not making it look too obvious
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:22:55 mad city skipped the "not making it look too obvious" part
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:23:07 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:24:21 the year is 2020. water is running out and we have to eat wood for food. all roblox front page games are simulators and humanity has fallen
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:25:26 well v0xel
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:25:59 notice how nearly all front page games are either previous roblox games but slightly different, or popular games that look a bit different
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:26:31 neither do i, i just heard that jailbreak finally died so i looked
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:27:21 remember when roblox had kills shown on your profile along with deaths?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:27:29 roblox used to be too trusting in their community
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:27:45 i forgot how many kills i had
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:27:48 i wasnt great
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:28:13 jailbreak is trying to cling onto life using clickbaity updates
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:29:48 they arent
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:29:50 theyre FAR worse
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:30:10 the early roblox times were fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:30:39 you got money just for logging on for the day
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:31:23 tix shouldnt return
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:31:27 but it was nice while it lasted
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:31:46 but people were probably making bots to get a ton of tix and then transfering them to the main account
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:33:04 i remember the first game i played
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:33:23 you might not like it because it was one of pinewoods games but oh well the memory makes me happy
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:33:49 orange, if its unobtainable how do i have it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:34:23 pbcc has been fun for a while. but their community is kinda getting boring
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:34:57 oh well, pinewood will always have a place in my memory for the amount of time ive played at it, and had fun with the community there
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:35:44 yeah, roblox now adays isnt really supporting the small games
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:36:15 you have to now be one of the top 250 games in order to get featured, and they removed category searching, which is how most small games were found
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:36:35 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:36:43 if they wanted money they would support small developers
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:36:59 probably the interns just doing stuff for themselves so that THEY get money
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:37:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:37:43 children like to play the same thing except slightly different
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:37:51 thats why simulators exploded in popularity
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:38:39 oh well, maybe those children will grow up and decide to look for smaller games, or games with community rather than popularity
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:38:52 maybe some time in 5 or 10 years, small games will be booming again
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:39:04 not booming, but similar to how they used to be
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:39:51 though, the days when you could just build things without detail but instead to get the point across and the players would still appreciate it were the golden days
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:40:24 jesus. i just realized that i've been playing roblox for over half my life
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:40:44 i started playing when i was 7 or something and now im 17
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:42:04 ive been playing ever since you were born, orange
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 00:42:05 wow

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:39:13 Article 13 has passed! Quick, everyone post memes before the British do brexit and are able to see memes again!
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:40:04 Idk I'm not a european
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:40:14 But it was passed so prepare
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:49:15 Nice, Richard 🅱 peparing
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:50:51 Since the companies are responsible now in the EU, they're probably just going to not send any user generated videos or images to people in europe
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:52:11 I'm in America so article 13 isn't as much of a problem for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:52:36 It will suck seeing all the European memers go but they will be back
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:52:48 Yeah, sorry rick
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:52:51 Richard*
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:52:52 Aaa
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:53:05 Move to America maybe, ya kno
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:53:11 We have stuff like nenes here

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:53:59 Oh yeah don't forget the Canadian geese
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:54:16 Roblox is prpbably just going to block access to Roblox in the EU
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:55:08 Most companies are probably just going to block Europe until the people commit localized world war 3 non nuclear addition and get the internet back
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:56:14 Well Rick, if you use a VPN with the base in America or somewhere not in the EU, then you should still be able to look at the outside internet
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 14:57:09 Not hard to find
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 15:26:24 I thought he was americano
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 17:12:17

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:08:21 Speaking of voxel
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:08:31 Lower the drag on the wings >:/
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:28:03 I wish contests cared more about functionality than looks
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:28:22 I could probably make a ship that goes hella fast
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:30:20 I'm the co leader of leaf gang
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 19:30:23 Bow down

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:19:08 <@155149108183695360>
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:19:11 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:19:13 Grape
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:19:27 Aight they took grape off the list of bad words
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:31:46 is anybody here a non native english speaker?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:31:59 oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:32:08 yeah i was just curious real quicc
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:32:55 you meet a guy with an american accent speaking your language, what do you automatically think? (aka stereotypes, im genuinely curious)
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:33:15 nothing you can say will offend me, just what are stereotypes of americans
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:33:40 i mean i guess i would think the same about the russians
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:33:46 i wouldnt think they came to shoot me with it
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:33:51 obviously
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:34:02 but of course, strong bois
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:34:35 oh yeah i know
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:34:44 drug dealers are shoot on sight if i remember
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:35:02 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:35:17 but besides the gun thing, any other american stereotypes?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:35:28 or just gun
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:35:40 oh yeah, redneck stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:35:59 liberals
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:30 i was kinda just trying to ask people who are non native english speakers but aight
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:35 because theyre less likely to be american
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:44 aka biased to say the cool stereotypes like freedom
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:53 british people are cool
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:57 bar fights
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:36:58 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:37:04 relaxing while getting bombed
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:37:47 i havent heard much about phillipine stuff so im not good at stereotyping them
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:03 but if i had to either stereotype a Pilipino go or die
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:06 i would say uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:15 ee
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:18 well i would say
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:23 shush up im bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:33 sounds fun to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:38 sounds like fortnite in real life
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:38:50 lets send some elementary schoolers there
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:39:00 put them on one of the islands
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:39:04 last guy alive gets uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:39:08 congratulations
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:39:13 abortnite
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:40:51 well, america did come and deport the japanese from the Philippines in uhhhh the 1940s
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:00 so yeah i would imagine we would have left them americanized
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:16 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:27 but the most tragic thing about WW2
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:37 americans invading japan after they surrendered
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:38 why?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:41 it created anime
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:41:47 we left behind comics
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:43:36 anyways yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:44:04 in conclusion, the Philippines are america except on veteran difficulty
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:47:17 i thought you said you were Philippino
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:47:40 oh, makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:47:49 im sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:47:53 im not a raceologist
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:48:07 im not a racist i dont know what the different races are
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:48:19 i know
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:48:21 i was joking
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:48:41 anyhoo imma go do my uuuhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:48:45 idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:49:05 rip europe, brexit is probably more supported now that article 13 is a thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:50:40 but im an americanesian so i dont have to worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:50:45 ill still worry about it though
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:50:59 because the internet shouldnt have regulations like that on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:51:19 sure we lost net neutrality but at least we didnt gain something like article 13
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:51:23 thats just bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:51:41 for now theyre just rubber bullets
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:52:22 but yeah there will probably be riots, or maybe just protests about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:52:46 and the people who voted for article 13 will be eaten but oh well
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:53:06 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:53:26 oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:53:49 v0xel wants to say something but doesnt know how to say it
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:54:03 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:55:09 article 13 just makes the companies responsible for copyrighted material uploaded by users. aka if youre in the EU, the companies will block you to prevent any risk of you uploading copyrighted content. or at the very least put very, VERY strict filters on EU accounts
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:00:38 wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:00:39 flame
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:00:42 you have a child?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:01:05 didnt think i would ever meet a guy playing roblox who has a kid
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:01:12 except devs
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:01:20 or the admins
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:28:20 environmentally friendly is just the "politically correct" of industry
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:17:59 remember that time spongebob was too socially anxious to tell sandy that he was slowly dying due to there not being any water in her house
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:06:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 14:56:30 Oh so it's like the opposite of that airport with no port only plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 14:56:44 Aka the air tanker thing they use to refuel jets
general 2019-03-27 14:58:09 
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:01:31 Exploiters are rare in plane crazy because exploiting isn't really fun in plane crazy. So if you do get in a server with an exploiter, join a different one
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:01:39 Neat
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:03:57 The only thing you can do in plane crazy woth exploits is fling people's creations
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:04:07 Which gets boring real quicc
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:05:05 Build a plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:06:12 I tried making an 8bit adder circuit but it's really difficult
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:06:35 Except Richard and big mak
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:06:42 And also roli poli

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:10:03 Hah
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:10:09 Yeah we always say that
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:10:16 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:42:52 No
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:42:57 There's no ingame mods
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:43:34 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:43:43 An sr72 fighting falcon
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:43:45 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 15:59:41 Fun fact: D-Day stands for Day-Day
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 16:01:32 Well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 16:02:15 Imagine being in a suit that's constantly trying to push to resting position and hard to maneuver in and having to walk over walks
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 16:02:21 With moon gravity
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 16:02:37 Fun fact: you can die from being alive
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 16:13:21 Uuuhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 17:09:43 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 17:14:24 I invented a rope launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:04:39 Hey richard
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:05:02 Any plans for logic gates or still no?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:06:01 It's getting kinda close to april
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:06:23 And remember, if no logic gates by April, I'll have to change your name to Rachel
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:07:14 I told him that back in November
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:07:21 Me no forget
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 19:26:46 Vapes are just addictive inhalers

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:35:22 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:35:40 1945 colorized
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:34:22 uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:34:28 that sounds kinda bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:34:59 why have guns on a creation that have to be aimed when you can just put your cursor on another creation and click
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 14:38:13 Bruh.wav I was petting my cat and I took my hand away and he tried to grab my arm but since I was pulling away he made 3 massive slices across my wrist
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 14:38:35 Now I look like one of those edgy kids who cut themselves
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 14:38:41 NyeeeEEE

plane-crazy 2019-03-28 14:55:37 Also the only multiplayer games i have on it are civilization 6 and stellaris
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 14:58:16 Remember back in like, 2008-2010 when Roblox played achievement sounds when you collected badges?
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 15:04:01 Termed
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 15:04:02 What
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 15:04:17 Oh

plane-crazy 2019-03-28 15:05:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 15:09:40 Little blobby boy bitch
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 17:14:44 Big think
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 18:45:33 
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:12:41 Bruh imagine being lactose intollerant. Just imagine how it would feel to know that you have inferior genes.
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:16:19 Glitching plane crazy CHALLENGE(GONE WRONG)(3:00 AM)(NOT CLICKBAIT)(FBI SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE)(ALMOST DIED)
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:16:58 Well deuh
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:17:32 I was a moderator in a different discord and this guy modified his client to be able to see admin chats
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:17:36 Speaking of that
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:18:14 I used to have an exploit engine to test my anti exploits, and I wondered what would happen if i injected a Roblox exploit into discord.
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:18:17 It crashed
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:19:40 My exploit engine key was blacklisted when the exploit engine owner found out I was making anti exploits
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:19:47 So rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:21:25 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:22:52 I wanna go to the hospital again. It was nice there. They put you on painkillers so strong that it's difficult to stand
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:23:35 What
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:23:45 The hell
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:24:23 I ripped the skin off of my arm due to a sun burn and there's no trace of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:24:48 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:25:25 "Accidentally"
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:29:20 Also going into surgery was fun. I wasn't afraid because it was just an appendix surgery and I knew what was going to happen. So basically they bring your bed into the room, slide you onto a metal slab thing, put a mask on your face, lie to you and say you're on oxygen, then you wake up with 3 holes in your belly
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:29:24 Twas great
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:31:02 I have a "sunken chest" as my mom calls it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:31:12 Basically, my chest is curved inwadd
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:31:31 I don't think I'll need surgery on it, but recently it's been kinda hurting there
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:31:57 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:32:07 I have a weird shoulder blade as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:32:24 My entire life I've been able to make my left shoulder blade stick out
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:32:29 Never hurted
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:32:38 I just found out one day that i could do it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:33:52 So basically I can sniff my own butt hole
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:34:02 Jk but I can bend over really far
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:34:21 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:35:25 I was exaggerating, but I can touch the top of my head with the top of my foot
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:35:56 Well, I haven't done it in a while
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:36:03 So maybe puberty made me unable to do it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 19:37:21 I made a rope launcher with port and starboard attachments, and this is how I got inventer

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 21:35:42 The falcon heavy wasn't required for this load, space ex just wants to show that the falcon heavy is good, and hopes to get more people building heavy satellites and stuff to put on the falcon heavy

plane-crazy 2019-04-16 19:25:19 Hey guys, remember that if Richard doesn't add logic gates by July 30, he gets banned in real life
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 19:25:51 Good
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 19:26:13 But I'm not going to prepare to ban him in real life because I believe he will have added logic gates by then
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 19:26:54 And if he's a Buddhist I will IP ban him so he can't come back

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:09:00 Someone should invent explosive rounds. I tried to but since aerodynamics seem to drag the entire creation equally unless you have wing panels I can't make it fly stabilly
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:16:20 No, you launch the round, when it hits something, it explodes
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:17:09 I did that but since aerodynamics bad I cant get it to fly straight. No wing panels causes it to sound, wing panels causes it to wiggle and fly off to the side
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:25:37 Unfortunately this year's egg hunt is going to be the last
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:25:44 And it's a bad egg hunt
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 15:25:59 So it's going to end on a low note
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:12:43 If you make an evolution simulator on Roblox and the animals evolve to fuck each other would Roblox be able to ban you
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:13:01 Because it's not programmed specifically to do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:13:21 It would be like being banned for am rng to give you 69 and 420
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:59:15 I'm aware fonkl
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:59:22 There are downsides to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:59:30 Diddleshots downside is hes a weeb
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:59:38 And sometimes acts impulsively
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:00:29 Yeah, I remember that fonkl
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:00:34 It was actually over a year ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:00:44 On October 20 of 2017
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:02:33 Anyways. Basically what happened is woofmacht didn't like something about something idk, I personally think he lied so that he could get a bunch of pinewoods members. So he got a bunch of the admins he hired and basically told diddleshot that he sucks and if he didn't give pinewood to them they would say mean things about him. So he fires them and they make hyptek.
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:02:38 So that's what happened
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:03:16 Yeah, diddlemans isn't great at knowing who to trust
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:03:43 Considering woofmacht left months earlier because Lego was fired but he came back
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:03:59 Woof started it if that what you're asking
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:05:37 I don't know, he claimed that diddleshot removed watermarks from models and didn't pay the devs(even though diddleshot later posted a picture of his dms with the devs where he offered to pay them for their work) and then they made hyptek
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:08:11 Pretty much. And recently (like this month or last month) the head of security who was also the head of intelligence left because diddleshot told him that not every conversation involving pinewood had to include him and he got angry and took all the admins he hired and left and a bunch of members followed him because they liked logo
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:08:18 And now we have csdi
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:08:35 I have a feeling he's going to end up going the same way
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:09:02 Logo wasn't an asshole, he just had different ideas of what he was than what diddleshot intended
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:09:22 No
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:09:31 At heart he isn't an ass
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:09:58 He probably just felt like he was told that he wasn't as important to pinewood as he always thought he was
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:11:06 That's not being an ass, that's him feeling kinda betrayed per se
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:11:18 It's all a matter of perspective
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:11:59 In logos perspective, he was told that he wasn't important to pinewood. In diddleshots perspective, he was correcting logo on what his role at pinewood actually was
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:13:34 Logos role was head of security and head of intelligence. The pia is the group of admins and moderators so logo was in charge of keeping the games properly moderated. Pbst is pbst so he was also in charge of hiring the trainers. But that doesn't mean he was vice president or something like he thought he was
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:15:51 Eh. A vice chairman is basically chairman that has a boss(aka the actual chairman). He was only in charge of the moderation and security, he couldn't do everything that diddleshot could, like a vice chairman would imply
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:22:54 Anyways speaking of pinewood. It has a media department called pinewood builders media. Right now we're making a show called "judge wicky" which is basically judge Judy except we use security reports and weird scenarios (ex: "fire extinguisher abuse" or "I thought a round was a magazine!") And sometimes make up entire cases. I made one called "Lord of the bees" where a guy brought several cargo crates full of bees into the facility and released it claiming that he was Lord of the Bees. 13 people were killed and he was about to get life in prison or even death row, but then his lawyer brings up that all of the deaths were furries so Judge Wicky decided to give him 3 hours of community service.

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:05:56 U runed a chan
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:12:44 Apparently American scientists did "criticality experiments" where they put neutron reflectors near nuclear bomb cores to see how close they could get until the reaction went supercritical
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:13:47 One time the scientist's screw driver holding up the neutron reflector slipped and the core went supercritical but he slapped the reflector off in time so it didn't explode, but his entire arm was dead within a day and he was dead in about a month
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:14:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:14:39 Who knew that getting as close to manually detonating a nuclear bomb as possible was dangerous
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:15:37 Yeah, he did. Maybe anyways, the guys in the room still suffered a Dank dose of radiation but I think they lived longer
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:15:59 They say they saw a blue flash
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:16:33 Which is probably because the neutrons emitted by the core would move faster than light their the fluid of their eyeballs, causing a blue glow
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 16:16:44 Anyhoo gtg

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:47:38 Funn
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:47:47 Now we just need frikkin
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:47:50 Big mak
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:47:54 To stop having a life
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:47:58 And give us stuff
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:48:01 NYEE
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:48:31 I wonder if big mak has made a small mak yet

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:48:57 Thank
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:49:37 Is air resistance due to a script in the wings or due to roblocks?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:07 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:34 Is air resistance due to a script in the wings or is it a Roblox thing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:56 I'm asking Richard the thiccard
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:53:18 Aight so if the air resistance is part of a script
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:53:21 I have an idea
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:56:41 I would imagine that the wings in place crazy check which direction the wing is moving. The more the wing moves in a direction where it's flat, the more resistance it feels
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:57:37 Magnet probably puts a force object on whatever is close  to ot
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 15:00:25 Richard should add a no anime rule
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:15 My god
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:53 I just heard an air raid syren and a bunch of cop cars sounding their alarms and it scared the hell out of me
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:59 Thought nukes were coming
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:02:15 I didn't have my phone so I didn't know

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:08:13 Strange

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:08:22 Of america
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:09:30 I was worried because nobody else said anything about it and we were just standing there andif I went for my phone I would get in trouble
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:09:51 I have 30 minutes for nukes to get here so I had the time to waot
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:10:02 Wait what happened

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:10:44 Ok but why
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 18:09:22 You lay down on the bed, waiting for rickje to get home with his special sauce. Once he comes home and comes into the room, he says that motors aren't broken, and you leave because you decide it's not worth it
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 18:42:58 It has to happen eventually

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 19:57:23 I sent rickje the fan fiction where he doesn't get to give his special sauce because the person leaves because rickje said that the motors were fixed
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 19:57:29 He's not responding
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 20:38:32 Remember kids: debate students are more formally called master debaters

plane-crazy 2019-05-02 15:58:48 So it auto stabilizes
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:09:55 (1/0)x0=1
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:10:04 And anything times 0 is 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:10:16 And that's one of the many reasons you can't divide by 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 18:49:00 So leaf gang is making a new hangout and the leaf king didn't make it green enough so I decided to make it a little bit greener

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:46:13 The port and starboard attachments was to increase the blocc count
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:46:28 Since for some reason you need a minimum amount of blocks to have invented something
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:46:33 Ooh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:46:37 I shall make it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:47:06 Why is there a block limit anyways?

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:17:51 They understand humor
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:22:59 Wait, you can pay for stuff in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:18 Idk how that's p2w
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:17 Apparently madattak is the guy whose going to make the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:25 So everyone yell at madattak
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:29 To make the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:29:09 Logic gates are going to be the most impactful addition that plane crazy will get.
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:30:21 Paired with sensers, memory blocks, and some repeaters(clocks?), Logic gates will make so many things possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:35:00 Scp-69420
Special containment procedures: a standard containment cells of 10ftx10ftx10ft. All birds on Earth have been killed and replaced by mechanized versions to prevent suspicion from thr public and to fill the hole left by the birds.
Description: SCP 69420 gains power from birds. The more birds that are alive, the more force that scp-69420's beak can exert. With enough birds alive, SCP-69420's beak can crush matter into neutronium.
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:35:44 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:15 My first creation was a giant flying male reproductive organ
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:19 I deleted it though
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:23 So I'm a good boy
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:35 It flew super well though
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:41 Surprisingly aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:04 At least I'm not one of those guys who mad one that uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:10 Spews some special sauce
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:45 Aight fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:06:17 But come on, every male makes one at some point
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 14:58:54 Rickje dies in endgame to save madattak from diddleshot confirmed
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 15:36:37 E
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:48:40 So I found out why my neural networks didn't work. Apparently when randomly generating the net I did ```lua
math.random(-10,10)/10```
But I looked at a professionally neural network library and it did
```lua
math random()*2-1```
Which is somehow different... But it worked so even though that means I basically wasted days and days doing debugging, I'm happy.
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:53:49 Neural network
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:22 It's a form of artificial intelligence designed roughly off of how neurons work
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:31 You make it learn to do stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:44 Google uses them for text to speech or speech to text
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:55 Also for efficiently cooling servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:05 And a lot of other stuf
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:07 But me
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:22 I'll use them for many things, but right now I'm making an evolution simulator
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:16 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:23 But they won't learn while they're alive
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:28 That's going to come later
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:37 But right now, it would take too much stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:43 Their brains will just evolve
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:49 Not actually learn
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:01 Oh yeah him
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:03 He's cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:22 But im more doing stuff like carykh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:29 Where he makes evolution simulators
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:34 Except his are really basic
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:41 Just nodes with clocks on them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:51 Or just circles with colors and neurons
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:57 I wanna make them better
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:58:32 Right now the creatures can only make their blocks 50% bigger or smaller, but I'll make them able to move them in the future
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:01:43 Repeat until nil is my preferred loop over whole true do
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:37:39 I got inventor for making a net launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:41:48 Plane crazy can be whatever I want
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:42:50 If they removed builders club they better give the lifetime builders club members lifetime premium
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:42:58 Oh hell rickardo
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:43:36 If they remove builders club
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:43:41 I swear to god
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:44:04 If they remove builders club, the people with lifetime builders club better get something really really good
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:44:38 Well then they shall be sued
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:12 Oh okay, so it still needs builders club
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:13 Good
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:58 Well if they remove builders club then that means people with lifetime builders club will be able to sue roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:17 It's not buyable anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:28 Doesn't mean people don't still have it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:47 Damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:52 Roblox increased gay
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:20 Roblox is just going bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:31 It's moving away from what it always had been
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:03 It is
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:07 I can make games ez
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:16 Also rickolas can make games
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:18 So uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:24 Still a game developing platform
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:50:48 I make anti exploits all the time
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:19 Precisely
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:25 Thats why you ban event spammers
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:31 Aka anti exploit
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:38 <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:39 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:46 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:48 You cant
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:51 But uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:55 I don't get your point
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:52:40 Well if they come back ban them again
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:52:42 Duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:09 Not most
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:12 But eh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:35 It would be an idea to flood Vermillion with virus exploits so that people will learn jot to use free exploits
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:33:35 Richard bad why there no smooth plastic material
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:33:55 I shall delete everything he loves and only press control z when he adds smooth plastic
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 23:45:17 aka chez
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:49:36 Nice train
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:29 Bruh spam
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:31 Illegal
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:43 You are gonna to died is 6.0913 nanoseconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:10:32 Well idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:12:51 Oh well maybe Roblox is just angry that logic Gates aren't added yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:36:40 Woah bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:25 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:33 Imagine if girls were real
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:43 I wonder what it would be like
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:46 Society
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:49 'n shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:05 Why
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:16 Why do you have a swashplate that complex
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:21 You only need like
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:27 3 propellers
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:40 so uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:50 i made this evolution simulator type thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:51 and uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:54 https://gyazo.com/78a1a3972bdcf60a8c8d9aa460cb91c8
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:44:03 at least its moving
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:44:28 rope launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:40:54 so i gave my little evolving creatures new inputs rather than just a clock brain, now they can tell which way their heart(the red thing) is facing https://gyazo.com/9740227b8a888c88e27f30a2304930c7
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:41:06 they still look like theyre suffering but oh well not my problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:09 if they become sentient they will only be able to take over the square that they are in
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:34 duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:36 that comes later
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:45:03 eh at least we will have spinny block things controlling us
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:02 oh sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:06 back
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:17 yes their body changes through mutations
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:53 and i have ai as a neural network, i made a neural network library so that its easy to impliment and use in my games
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:05 or other peoples games, since its freely available
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:10 but theres not much to it right now
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:20 just create, run, and mutate
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:55:56 k
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:56:09 feel free
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:57:45 well i already have a food system, its not implimented yet because they die immediately if its just food, since they dont move much at the beginning they just starve
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:57:52 which is why im evolving them to move
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:23 and im thinking of adding sharp objects where if the sharp object hits the creatures heart, it dies and leaves behind nutrients
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:36 yeah i have "joints" and "muscles"
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:40 but they kinda
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:47 yeah hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:03 oh god i looked away for several generations and they look in pain
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:23 duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:32 the extra blocks just means more nutrients
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:58 that might work
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:00:00 might not
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:00:40 yeah i have this perlin noise ground which was originally to make fertility differences, but i can also use it for making small hills and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:31 https://gyazo.com/0a05524b47b7b06a55a133edf94f5137
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:41 it looks like its suffering
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:52 yeah probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:10 they have brains so it might actually be lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:25 but i doubt their brains are complex enough to experience suffering
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:37 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:43 ill add stuff and things
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:04:03 but i think they move enough now, ill wait for their genetics to be saved and then ill add some walls
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:25:56 pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:26:08 just got my saved creatures to load, so now im going to add the food and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:26:39 not yet, i was busy working on the load stuf
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:51:21 still just adding the food thing, its a bit complicated balancing this
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:01 Here's an idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:09 Make a calculator
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:20 It will be difficult but anything for inventor ammirite
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:09:42 I've been finding free models pretty useful in my projects recently. I of course check them for loaders to make sure they're safe, and people upload a lot of useful stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:09:56 Like a base64 encoder/decoder
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:10:06 And a neural network thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:10:27 But I don't use actual models like trees and stuff because those are bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:20 Yeah, the actual free models suck
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:28 But script modules are really nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:45 Because I can't be bothered to script my own base64 encoder/decoder
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:16:03 Bruh I bet 700 robux that I have more chromosomes than you
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:07:24 <@340543153922768906> gayer
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:07:52 Well of course
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:09:29 Magnets are good
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:09:44 They got me the supersonic engineer role 🅱)

the-dump 2019-05-09 21:44:02 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:04 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:14 Imagine if plane crazy had uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:22 Toasters
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:33 Scusm
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:37:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:11 Rickolas is working in the rewrite if I'm correct
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:27 Which means he SHOULD be working on bigger plots
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:41 Which MEANs I can make even BIGGER noob worms
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:46:03 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:47:02 For peasants who don't know who that is, that's David baszuchi, the CEO of roblox

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:48:18 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:16 True but you don't let a bank Robber get away after stopping a murderer
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:20 You still arrest him
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:53 I guess

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:07:40 Delete yourself before I delete you in real life
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:08:12 It's an exploit engine that you pay for
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:08:15 And yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:08:30 There are people sad enough that they will pay for an exploit engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:08:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:09:05 I believe this conversation is against the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:02:46 Richard hasn't spoken in at least 2 hours
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:02:53 It's time for riot and mutany

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:11:24 I made a wall climber and it's actually pretty decent
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:12:06 Unfortunately it can't go on the bottom of the map because the turned are too tight, also there's a ledge so it can't turn correctly
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:12:10 But hey
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:12:11 Is gud

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:47:48 You
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:47:53 Spamming "UwU"
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:47:57 It's illegal here

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:29 I wonder when rickje will invent logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:51 He said big Mac is supposed to make the logic gates but e
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:55 Logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:57 Basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:17 Take inputs, and do something logicy with them and give an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:50 Like the and gate takes both inputs and gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:59 The or gate takes one or both inputs and give an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:54:18 The xor gate takes one of either inputs but not both and gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:55:24 The not gate inverts the signal. If it gets an input, it doesn't let out an output. If it doesn't get an input, it gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:55:43 I was thinking a tab where you can set up the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:07:09 Snow blaster is just a heavier, less powerful rocket change my mind
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:09:32 In America living is expensive
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:09:54 But that's good because that means the surgeons are good
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:10:31 And imagine being a surgeon. Getting paid to cut open and remove people's organs and not getting arrested
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:17:08 Probably hired that guy to get him out of finals
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:19:49 The only gang's here are vape gang's and they don't really do anything they just argue which flavor is better
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:59:20 Hello I'm from Microsoft and I believe your compooter has a virus
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 16:02:41 Attention fellow epic gamers. Rickje needs your help. You can help him by sending me those cool numbers on the front, the fun birth day, and those wacky 3 numbers in the back. Send them quickly because he doesn't have much time!
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 16:10:10 Rickje whispers "motors aren't broken" in your ears while you get ran over by a noob with bug legs ASMR

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:10:04 I had a massive cannon that I called the Titan cannon. Spawning it in crashed the entire server because Richard did something to a part that caused the entire creation to become just stupidly laggy
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:10:20 It had like 300 suspension, probably more
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:11:24 Mine was WELL over 2k blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:11:29 Lemme see if i can find pictures
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:12:02 
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:05 <@435946988559925248> did you see my creation?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:18 Scroll up a bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:55 Yeah, I made it so it launches as massive things as possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:14:12 You see the gigantic whale shaped thing hanging from the top?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:14:58 I replaced that with full density ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:15:10 And it launched it at 300 sps
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:07:59 I wonder then thickje will fix motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:23:17 Top 10 saddest anime deaths
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:32:00 Sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:32:06 It's still against the rules

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:43:06 Holy fucking shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:43:14 I think I just got struck by lightning
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:44:45 I was sitting in the living room because my internet went out because the house was struck by lightning. So that was fun. But then the room I was in got struck by lightning; the roof flashed, I heard a loud pop, and I felt a little sizzle
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:44:58 So technically I was struck by lightning because I felt the sizzle
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:44 Frick the lightning strike destroyed my internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:46 Sad
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:54 I have data on my phone at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:57 So hello
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:53:50 My computer still works
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:54:06 Maybe the tower or whatever got struck as well

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 14:58:08 You can fit heavy spinning things in tanks
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 14:58:19 Like massive suspension cannons
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 14:58:30 And stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 14:58:35 Giant cannons

plane-crazy 2019-05-20 15:08:45 What's up gamers
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:25 Yeah he doesn't even need a plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:28 He's a bird
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:38 Also rickje*
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:54 I'm assuming you meant rickje anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:47:57 Roblox should make global warming illegal so that we don't have global warming anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:24 Hot summer is horrible
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:48 You guys up North don't care so much
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:52 I prefer winter
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:57 Because the longer the winter
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:03 The worse time the wasps have
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:06 Thr more they die
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:47 Well no, not all of us, but there would be more water at costal cities
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:56 But global warming makes it so wasps have a better time
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:58 Which
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:00 Is bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:17 Wasps eat bees
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:37 Yes and global warming kills more than it helps
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:57:39 Helium in plane crazy is bad, 1 block of helium in plane crazy carries like 2 blocks of block. And in real life a block of block would require like 10 helium blocks to fly
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:58:34 If the helium was compressed then it would lift even less

plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:43:12 Fun fact: the speed of light is symbolized by "c" because the speed of light has nothing to do with light, the speed of light is actually the speed of causality, hence the "c"

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 17:59:43 Logic gates will allow all the things
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 17:59:46 Lol no

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:01:09 Oh ok fun
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:01:25 Do I get the jetpack on the alt or do i get it on my main
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:07:23 Someone send me the plane crazy link, I can't find it on mobile aaaa
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:21:38 Richard, any idea when e get logic gates?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:21:43 I require logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:46:53 When you thonk about it, America making other countries democratic makes America weaker, because then people will be less likely to flee to America and give us their information.
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:50:53 Just letting you guys know if I suddenly stop talking for a few days, don't be surprised, because it probably means i had a heart attack
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:51:05 I got dumped onto my chest onto a chair and my chest kinda hurts
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:07 If I don't talk for the next couple of days then don't be surprised because it probably means I had a heart attack
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:35 I'm aware that i said it
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:50 But nobody responded so I expected that you didn't see it

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:01 <@486674992981999648>that looks disturbing, like a Furry or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:29 It was your post
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:40 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:41 My b
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:49 But furries are just
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:53 Disturbing
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:30:02 And I hate being reminded that they exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:30:46 Yeah, there are some decent furries
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:23 My sister is a furry, but she's not one of the weird ones
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:37 The difference there is that Jews were born like thst
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:44 They can't change the fact that they're a jew
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:50 Or hide the fact that there a jew
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:34 If that was the case then in Germany the Jews would have just said they weren't jews
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:38 But that didn't work my guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:51 Because you make it obvious
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:07 Yeah but you do now
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:32 And don't compare being a Jew to being a furry
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:48 Because that's fucked up even though I'm sure that Germany would have gassed furries as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:50 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:34:17 You have a fur suit too
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:34:34 Sorry my phone is really dim to save enety
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:34:37 Energy*
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:34:43 Looked like a fur suit
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:18 Idk but just
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:19 Aaa
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:49 Wait weren't you banned for calling people retards and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:50:56 That's not kidnapping
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:01 That's adultnapping
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:05 B)
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:33 Katze, you already got banned for calling people retards

plane-crazy 2019-06-23 23:42:31 <@456226577798135808> what
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 04:11:35 
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 00:16:49 fun fact: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxH4CAlhtiQ SpaceX is launching 3 NASA test satellites. one is an atomic clock to keep rockets firing on time for the correct amount of time. One is testing a new type of rocket fuel that is cheaper, less hazardous, and denser(aka more can be packed into a smaller space), and my personal favorite: one that is testing a Solar Sail
general 2019-06-25 00:20:26 reminder: use plenty of quicksaves.
quicksave:F5
load quicksave: hold F9
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 01:38:06 i wonder who the guy is who accidentally set his food on fire and discovered that it tasted better that way
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:13:00 SpaceX is launching the falcon heavy for the third time in 17 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxH4CAlhtiQ
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:13:24 its launching 3 test satellites by nasa
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:14:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:15:57 one of the 3 test satellites is a solar sail, which is quite cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:48:39 attention fellow gamers: some nerd has made a link that steals your account and turns it into a bot to send messages with the link. https://twitter.com/splitsplatted/status/1143556723266994176?s=19 basically if someone sends you an invite link starting with "discordgg.ga" then report their account to discord and also report them to server admins to get them banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:19 because it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:20 nerd
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:42 its not one of those copypastas that claim that someone can magically steal your account just by being dmed by them
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:51:03 its one where you have to actually visit a link and get the virus from the fake website
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:51:04 so its real
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:52:57 im not entirely sure, but websites have histories of giving viruses "without asking" so just be safe
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:56:43 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:56:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:34 why would you think its not strange that that free robux game asks for your password?
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:37 in conclusion:
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:38 idiots
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:17:05 dogs like squeeky toys because it reminds them of the sound the animals make when dying.

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:20 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:46 didnt you hear?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:59 nasa confirmed that submarines are bad back in 1893
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:17 to be accurate
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:22 theyre a scientific organization
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:42 nasa observes earth you know
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:44 all the oceans
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:56 thats where a lot of scientists get their data about earth's environments

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:20 Now, honestly I can say that very few things scare me. But this THING, this AD literally gave me chills when I saw it.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:31 it scares me
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:59 fuck ive refreshed the page several times at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:06 it wont get off my fucking screen
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:24 i cant stop looking at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:41 im not using adblock because some ads are almost decent
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:54 i just closed the tab

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:19:00 i couldnt stop looking at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:00 ive been on roblox for literally a decade at this point, and at no point have i seen something so disgusting as that ad
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:05 its sad
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:31 that didnt give me chills
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:33 that just annoyed me

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:21:16 only the harder to reach communities, like this one, are actually good
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:21:17 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:32:12 
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:32:14 im proud of myself

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:32:41 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:32:46 there are modes?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:33:00 this one just lets you choose how many mines you want
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:33:23 sounds funn
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:36:54 fuck i havent watched wallace and grommet in a while

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:48:50 how luckily unlucky can you get
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:08 tf is an SPG
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:24 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:32 well its not self propelled
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:33 so no
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:35 its not
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:41 humans are though
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:43 well
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:45 at least men are
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:50:06 sorta
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:51 poop stinkies
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:45:55 imagine in the future space warfare becomes a thing and we get things like spacecraft carriers
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:04 woah what just triggered orange
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:23 oh i just saw what happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:29 thats an oof from me dawg
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:35 ayyy rickje is online
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:43 <@!217336009455566848> give logic gate or die
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:47:20 chillacc
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:47:23 what even happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:47:50 rickje requires ping
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:48:14 its fine we have a good relationship
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:22 <#529858892075761694> how about mother fricking logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:31 logic gates will be a game changer when they eventually add them
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:41 they will allow for so much more creative and impressive builds
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:46 they should be top priority tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:31:25 they need to be
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:31:30 richard needs to
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:04 thats because nobody cares about those
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:06 noobsicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:19 
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:37:32 <@233700700406808576> build a clock
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:37:37 i heard nobody made a clock yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:07 gears are for lards
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:28 multiplication?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:38 somebody already did addition and subtraction?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:05 how many bits could it add
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:15 epicc
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:29 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:33 i should try making a clocc
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:40 not tonight, but some day
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:44 binary is easy
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:53 01000101 is 69
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:07 k
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:14 well there are these things called logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:20 *COUGH NOISES*
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:33 eh i cant explain it i have to go to bed
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:35 goodnight
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:47 nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:50 exactly 17
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:53 goodnight
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:03 you said above
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:04 lardo
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:11 i knew this stuff when i was 15
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:49 my school has an AP computer science thing and i did that and i was like "cool wtf is this" and the teacher taught me and now its cool and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:54 anyhoo goodnight this time
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:02:32 Poop stinkies
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:40:49 lets face it: being a girl is pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:41:01 statistically less likely to get murdered
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:41:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:41:25 less of them though
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:41:51 oh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:42:06 oh well, it sucks that girls arent real
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:42:22 girls arent real
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:42:36 they are a lie made by bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:42:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:43:11 your life is a lie
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:43:30 hahA
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:43:44 i mean girls also get a lot of opportunities
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:43:48 look at belle delphine
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:43:52 she sells her bath water
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:44:16 <@456226577798135808> whatever unisex means
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:44:35 oh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:44:45 they exist so that the public doesnt get suspicious
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:45:50 i just remembered that i was still listening to that 30 minutes of world war 1 sounds video because i tuned it out
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:46:04 like just ignored it
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:46:05 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:46:09 oh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:46:09 have fun in the after life
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:46:45 they exist bathroom companies just modified you at birth
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:04 who needs urinals when you can just sitt down and pee
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:15 jk thats only for weaklings
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:21 speaking of that
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:29 does anybody here take shits sitting down?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:44 <@!434989303882579981> weakling
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:47:58 meme died literally 3 years ago
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:48:24 i just shit into my hand and throw it in the toilet
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:48:28 im washing my hands after anyways
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:48:30 so why not
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:48:56 sorry im not THAT poor
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:32 shinx are you joking or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:37 be realistic
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:43 you make it look like we're joiking
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:49 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:49:54 its efficient
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:03 duh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:15 im stronger than you guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:18 i shit standing up
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:33 wrong
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:44 shitting standing straight up excersizes your bowel muscles
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:00 anyways back to diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:16 i just slosh it down the sink drain
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:40 i always stand up and shit in the shower just in case its diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:46 so its an easy cleanup
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:58 i am
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:02 what about that is unrealistic
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:15 i stomp it down and then run the shower
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:31 doesnt need to be
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:34 oh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:44 my chunks are small
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:57 i just move them on top of the drain and stomp them through it
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:00 my feet
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:21 because these people think im serious and its entertaining
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:33 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:42 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:52 i need to shit and im actually going to try my method
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:03 because im geniunely curious
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:10 no thats only diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:32 the whole point of standing in the shower was in case i had diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:51 otherwise i would just shit standing up, grab the shit as it was coming out, and place it in the toilet
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:59 i was going to clean my hands anyways so why not
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:55:58 why does velo have the imperialist japanese flag as their pfp
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:56:27 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:56:53 dweeb is worse because it stands for degenerate weeb
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:57:05 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:57:08 its not european
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:57:17 austria
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:57:19 stoopid
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:58:57 weeb bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:59:01 normal good
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:59:05 simple as that
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:30:55 what if humans evolved to look for cool sticks because before technology the people who had sticks were more likely to survive than ones who didn't due to the stick both being a weapon and way to help you walk up hills and stuff and prevent you from falling and breaking something, like your life.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:34:45 they got tired of us always suggesting logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:36:33 so that we can make helicopter rope things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:36:48 ropes that get tangles up in helicopter blades and stop them
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:37 yeah thats the sad part
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:40 hey vip
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:51 you should tell richard to add logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:16 they would be used for a multitude of things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:30 self flying missiles
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:36 self-stabilizing things and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:48 really cool robot shits
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:04 well we need it
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:26 well we need it
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:45 many more will figure out its purpose
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:52 many more will be able to create amazing things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:42:13 and that 1% is going to create beautiful things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:42:36 less than 1% of minecraft players use redstone to its fullest extent
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:42:40 and look what theyre doing
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:43:09 less long
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:43:11 buddy mans
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:43:26 roblock existed since 2004
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:43:32 became playable in 2006
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:03 redstone is more skillful than logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:10 logic gates would be simple and easy to understand
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:21 if you get this input and this input do this output
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:27 and this output extends pistons
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:36 wrong
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:39 its taken nearly a year
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:43 beat that liberal
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:57 he said he will
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:09 but he said he has to rewrite the game before adding them
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:27 hes rewriting it now
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:28 noobular
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:34 little bits at a time
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:53 not right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:45:55 you know what i mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:46:07 children can learn

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:06:43 yeah python is good
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:06:54 lua is literally a beginners language
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:07:10 its inferior in all ways besides ease of learning
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:07:26 python is like a solid 9/10
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:07:28 10/10 actually

bot-central 2019-07-28 20:52:00 &suggest make the center of mass compensate for the density of ballast blocks
bot-central 2019-07-28 20:52:10 >:/
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 20:52:38 the center of mass indicator should account for the density of ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 20:52:40 oh hi richard
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 06:21:28 i present to you: the smallest plane as far as im aware! https://gyazo.com/18cee68e1c5a0d07b41dd358a7a79d67
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 06:22:13 and thats why i said as far as im aware
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 06:22:39 i bet those are drones though
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 06:22:43 rather than actual planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 06:22:51 i could make a smaller drone

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 07:48:50 if somebody was trying to shoot you and you grabbed somebody else and put them between you and the shooter and the shooter shot them to death but you survived would that be illegal
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 07:50:31 no idea what verdict means but ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 07:51:19 okay well that could be said about anything
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 07:51:37 mass murder is illegal depending on verdict but its obviosu that its illegal
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 07:52:16 its self defense

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:01:44 russian computers are about equivilent to TI-82s
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:02:28 the only way communism could actually run is if there were slaves that we didnt consider citizens
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:02:32 so thats why communism is bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:02:43 unless you get robot slaves then thats cool but for now its bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:06:15 fun fact i had an english teacher who was communist
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 08:07:06 socialists are a lot more common than communists

plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:18:54 oooh
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:19:33 that means i can trail behind planes and destroy them mid air since bullets do less damage and rockets go about a slow as a plane that flies at all can go
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:21:37 also i've found that the bullets destroy some things server side and different things client side
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:21:41 and it angers me
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:06 if the developer is ***BAD***
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:10 jk hes good
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:11 but
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:16 its just server checking
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:17 and shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:32 when something hits server side, send it to the client for visuals
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:33 ez
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:57 it made me anger because i destroyed some biplanes entire tail and they just kept flying
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:59 and then
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:07 after shooting them a bunch they just froze midair
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:16 and they claimed to land at the air port
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:23 and i was robbed of satisfaction
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:28 big sad hour
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:34 ***nyeeeeeeh***
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 04:22:11 jk lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 08:16:29 I don't mean to get political or anything, but is tea technically soup?

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 09:03:45 David Baszuchi passed out Bloxy cola at the RDC
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 09:04:06 well, the roblox admins did

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 09:05:14 bazooka
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 09:52:31 imagine in the future if we all just live in virtual reality and youre living a normal life and then suddenly you hear combat music
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:38:49 imagine after world war 2 germany was the one to create anime instead of japan
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:39:18 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 02:26:06 yeah im ready to get my fu*cking mind blown
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 02:26:16 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 04:27:36 you know how birds have been walking on 2 legs for far longer than us?
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 04:27:44 i wonder if that means birds are better at having 2 legs than us and that humans are slowly going to evolve to have bird legs...
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 04:28:07 ostriches
plane-crazy 2019-08-15 21:43:32 Fun fact:

plane-crazy 2019-08-15 21:44:46 mk
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:30:04 imagine if you could put your child on vibrate
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:30:33 like, it just gets terrified that it cant make sound and it just vibrates so its screaming but no sound is coming from it and its just violently vibrating
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:41:13 fun fact: when physicians first found something that would harmlessly paralyze a person to be used in surgery, the physician wanted to prove it was safe by having a surgery on himself used with it. but he found out that its only effective at paralyzing patients, not numbing them, so he could feel every cut during his surgery, but other than that he was perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:42:05 yeah solid oof but hey at least the next person got numbing
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 05:47:54 i just realized that you dont have student-teacher conferences with your parents in college.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 05:48:31 its not that im purely a dumbass, its mostly because ive never thought about student-teacher conferences even in normal school
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 06:28:14 fun fact: homework was originally invented as a punishment
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 08:27:41 if 1.3 million people die in hospitals each year, we should shutdown all hospitals so that people arent put in such a dangerous place anymore
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 08:15:15 If i could breathe underwater none of you would ever see me again
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 08:15:43 ew

plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:11:47 not even thanos could beat noob worm
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:39:15 richard
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:39:26 how are you doin
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:39:44 *k fine ignore me idc*
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:43:55 oi richard real question this time
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:11 did you see my message about the client-glitch thing during pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:32 eh well it doesnt matter anyhoo
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:42 anyways ***logic gates***
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:49:23 i think i just broke the speed record for fastest controllable machine
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:49:28 48,000 sps
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:59:28 the only problem with my 48,000 sps controllable thing is that it cant roll, so it eventually goes upside down so it becomes confusing to control. but theoretically if you got used to it you could fly it indefinitely
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:59:58 anime is for weebs
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:00:28 the problem is theres no safe way to make it role
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:00:49 if i add wings to turn the craft, it becomes uncontrollable
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:00 i basically control the craft by shifting its center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:12 and weebs are bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:15 if you were unaware
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:02 also this is what the machine looks like
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:24 its really actually simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:43 its just a magnet engine with some spinny bits behind the engines that shift the center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:45 which do some shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:04 i have a custom pfp
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:07 its nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:13 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:27 its like 4 years old
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:32 its a drawing of my old avatar
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:05:50 yeah i remember that
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:02 it wasnt an actual game by the way
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:27 i renamed chrome to "fatass hoe" or whatever it was and yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:30 fun times
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:10:25 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:11:54 HOLY FUCKING SHIT
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:11:59 I WISH I WAS FUCKING RECORDING
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:15 MY MACHINE WAS GOING SO FAST AND IT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE DEADLANDS
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:20 AND THEN IT GLITCHES AND IT JUST
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:35 POPS UP HERE
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:35 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:00 also it broke
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:10 the engines are destroyed so it doesnt move anymore
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:16 but how the fuck did it just end up here
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:54 yeah the engines are fucked
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:14:09 the right one's piece is behind the engine and the left ones piece is nowhere to be seen
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:17:33 "bro even your glitches are glitching!"
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 20:03:00 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 20:13:40 i wish the reset option for motors worked at stupidly fast speeds because then my machine would be even easier to control
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:24 i dont know why people are downvoting my suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:28 i dont see any downside
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:49 in fact it would be a very good thing in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:47:30 other people can download the creation you uploaded, see how it works, and use its mechanics in their own creations. basically making the plane crazy creations my sophisticated and impressive
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:28:02 ...?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:28:34 its simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:29:33 richard already has load strings, so all he has to do is keep that in a datastore sepparate from the player's datastore, and then when a player wants to download it, it sets that load string to one of the player's memory slots
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:30:09 sounds complicated, but if you know what im talking about then you can tell its simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:30:45 its really not difficult
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:09 price?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:14 who said anything about price?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:23 i said download it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:24 for free
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:31 there isnt currency in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:46 and if you meant robux, then thats against roblox's terms of service
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:50 thats fair
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:12 i see no use of an ingame currency
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:34 well duh
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:46 if you dont want somebody to have your creation, then dont upload it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:59 but if you're generous, then go ahead
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:10 i have plenty of creations i would love people to see
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:14 and have
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:16 and change
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:35:24 or if you're like me and just create things that arent pretty, but rather could have a use or are just funny and wouldnt mind other people having access to it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:35:44 wait then why the fuck did you downvote it <@!395442152793964547>
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:01 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:10 explain how its bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:20 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:24 its unoriginal?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:56 wasnt me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:37:12 i always suggest thing about logic gates lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:37:21 logic gates would completely change everything
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:14 i dont understand what you mean <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:45 thats why you have moderators
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:58 to stop them from getting to the front page
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:39:03 so you would have to search for them
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:39:24 and searching for them is censored by roblox's censoring thing so it should be fine
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:26 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:27 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:32 does he hate the censoring that much
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:05 not ingame mods, just mini-mods that can moderate the content on the store thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:22 also there should be few enough instances where richard or big-mak can deal with it themselves
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:55 well
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:09 that would be less reliable
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:25 yes, and the votes will show the good ones
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:35 it will take a little bit of time for the good ones to show at the top
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:45 steam workshops get flooded with bad creations too
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:00 quackity is the fuckiest of shits
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:39 like, a sloppy, wet shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:42 thats what quackity is
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 07:33:58 florida man mistakenly commits die after smoking 1 too many marijuanoes
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:50:45 <@!217336009455566848> do the doors have aerodynamic things?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:50:47 like drag?

plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:05:16 i used to think i was gay until i realized that females were h0tter than dudes so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:06:16 fun fact: i used to moderate for an LGBT discord because my sister owned it. and when you moderate for the kind of discord prone to trolls, say, an lgbt one, you see some shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:23 also when i was a mod and somebody said "how do i get a rank" i would say "ask a mod" and never give them the rank unless they asked me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:33 to the point where other mods just did it for me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:34 was fun

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:49:16 Loser, I got sent to the principal second day for an accidental bomb threat because I turned in an "about me" paper that detailed how to make an antimatter bomb with an explosive yield similar to a supernova
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:49:24 Beat that liberal
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:49:59 It was 2 years ago in sophomore year
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:50:51 Luckily the principal didn't think I could actually destroy the solar system so he just had me explain why I would say that to a history teacher lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:51:52 Principal: "sit down please"
Me: -sits-
Principal: "do you mind explaining this?"
Principal: -hands me my paper that explained how to make the bomb-
Me: "uuhhh"

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:59:31 Cool, of you swallow a second magnet in like 20 minutes you can clamp your intestines shut and fucking die
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 16:59:44 Fun fact of the day right there
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:01:36 Plenty of neutrons everywhere buddy mans
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:02:23 In the core it's like that, but in anywhere but the core it's just some spicy gas
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:03:08 No, that's boring, the energy can't escape as quickly that way
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:03:43 These freshmen need to learn how to walk in the halls
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:02 They just wlak in the middle of the hallways when you're supposed to walk on the right side
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:22 Well get halls then
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:24 Loser
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:40 Oh you haven't invented halls yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:45 Invent halls
general 2019-09-07 20:46:18 
general 2019-09-07 20:46:58 well im about to ruin your impression
general 2019-09-07 20:47:00 a bot did that
general 2019-09-07 20:49:11 its called minesweeper
general 2019-09-07 20:49:24 if you're younger than 15 you wouldnt know what it is
general 2019-09-07 20:51:19 yeah it used to be a game that came downloaded with old windows versions like windows xp
general 2019-09-07 20:55:27 remember the early internet debate of pirates or ninjas?
general 2019-09-07 20:55:30 good times
general 2019-09-07 21:25:26 oh ok

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 17:37:35 its almost as good as logic gates
general 2019-09-08 18:07:52 Fun fact: when you mirror a bunny you get some weird hairy bird thing. maybe squidward?
general 2019-09-08 18:09:24 i used to moderate for an lgbt discord that my sister owned. it was the biggest on roblox and it got a lot of trolls
general 2019-09-08 18:09:37 and when you're a moderator for a troll-prone discord
general 2019-09-08 18:09:39 you see some shit
general 2019-09-08 18:09:48 i learned the hard way not to look at mod logs
general 2019-09-08 18:10:08 no she has a boyfriend
general 2019-09-08 18:10:14 hes a pretty nice guy
general 2019-09-08 18:10:42 and surprisingly they arent like buzzfeed feminists, when trump was elected they were like "alright, *maybe* he will actually be a good president?"
general 2019-09-08 18:10:54 yes her boyfriend is gay 100%
general 2019-09-08 18:11:12 its called a joke mr. person
general 2019-09-08 18:11:28 i used to think i was gay until i saw a female and was like
***MMMM***
general 2019-09-08 18:11:57 yeah pretty much
general 2019-09-08 18:12:00 but only in my head
general 2019-09-08 18:12:11 but yeah i was only thinking i was gay for the attention
general 2019-09-08 18:12:23 then i got bored
general 2019-09-08 18:12:30 and decided attention is for gay people
general 2019-09-08 18:12:49 idk
general 2019-09-08 18:13:09 but hey now im straight as heck and i stay at the back of class for 0 attention so yay i reformed myself
general 2019-09-08 18:13:14 its just character development now
general 2019-09-08 18:13:49 well yes, look at james charles
general 2019-09-08 18:13:51 famous for being gay
general 2019-09-08 18:14:29 makeup is for gay so no thanks
general 2019-09-08 18:15:21 but yeah, now adays i just co-own a group where our people dress up as leaves and hangout at cafes
general 2019-09-08 18:16:05 oh yeah when i was moderating for the lgbt discord i joked about extra genders since it made do sense so that eventually got me fired lol
general 2019-09-08 18:16:33 my sister fired me for saying "aight you believe what you want, but personally i dont believe that stuff"
general 2019-09-08 18:16:46 i modded there because my sister owned it
general 2019-09-08 18:17:25 and i kinda regret and kinda am happy that i modded there
general 2019-09-08 18:17:30 because of the things i saw
general 2019-09-08 18:17:42 now i can see pretty much anything and now im like "ok"
general 2019-09-08 18:17:48 people getting their heads cut off?
general 2019-09-08 18:17:51 "ok"
general 2019-09-08 18:18:06 fucked up
general 2019-09-08 18:18:19 and **thats** why i never applied for moderator here
general 2019-09-08 18:18:32 im okay seeing it but i dont like seeing it
general 2019-09-08 18:20:50 people also called me "queer god" because the discord had a chat where we could see what people were saying in-game and then run commands without ever being in the server. we could also talk from it so thats how i got the nickname
general 2019-09-08 18:21:21 their little hangout game
general 2019-09-08 18:21:26 oh
general 2019-09-08 18:21:46 i didnt, their old scripter did
general 2019-09-08 18:21:53 and they had a degree and stuff
general 2019-09-08 18:22:43 yeah, they used some 3rd party server where in-game would send http requests and then the server would send that to a discord bot that would post it
general 2019-09-08 18:23:17 and then whenever we did something like ;ban loser, it would send it to the in-game moderation system and yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:05:33 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:11 we're allowed to say bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:18 fuck bitches you know, nobody likes a bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:37 unless its an actual bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:40 because dogs are cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:41 aight
general 2019-09-09 18:52:04 i just realized that burritos are the mexican version of sushi. Instead of rice, its tortilla. instead of fish, its beef
general 2019-09-10 04:37:29 the teachers that smile all the time are the most suspicious
general 2019-09-10 04:37:32 they have some secret
general 2019-09-10 04:39:35 Roblox 2: Fuck Bitches
general 2019-09-10 04:40:03 its the 18+ roblox 100% not renamed google chrome guaranteed
general 2019-09-10 04:40:42 👌
general 2019-09-10 14:41:39 I was sick over the weekend and had to stay home on Monday, and then the day I come back everybody in the bus is sniffing and shit. I know who gave it to me too, some kid sat behind me on the bus coughing horribly and the next I'm really sick. When you become parents, keep your diseased little shits home even if it's the first week
general 2019-09-10 14:44:27 There weren't any vaccines for this, I don't even know what this is
general 2019-09-10 14:56:47 More than 7 it looks like
general 2019-09-10 16:07:43 Did you know a whale is bigger than a human
general 2019-09-10 16:09:38 Did you know your mom is a whale? <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
general 2019-09-10 16:09:47 True fact confirmed by NASA
general 2019-09-10 22:10:08 Quantum computers are just non-binary computers
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:48:18 does pilot seat do anything yet or is rick still bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:09 >:/
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:14 whats the point
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:42 ive used literally everything except cosmetic items that rick has given me and i still havent found a need for a second primary seat
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:08:24 I made a mouse-controlled missile, and it's VERY easy to fly, ESPECIALLY for a missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:11:21 Yeah, having 2 blocks perfectly flush with each other is bad because it creates a stupid amount of friction
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:11:38 That's why I bullied Richard into adding a 1x.9 block
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:12:59 Too baaaad
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:13:04 Make something
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:13:31 Also <@381263178589536257> could I get inventor squared since I already invented something
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:14:31 I know I already have inventor. I'm asking that since I already have inventor, if I invent another thing will I get inventor squared
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:15:01 Ah, so it's either 1 or infinity
general 2019-09-11 19:17:18 Why do male teachers talk about their kids a lot more than female teachers
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:18:30 Wait is there actually a role called crazy inventor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:19:48 Epic, if I knew about that then I would have claimed crazy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:09 Because I've invented so many things
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:11 Aight mk
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:46 <@339519624968404993> oi how many things do I have to invent to get crazy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:54 Epic
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:55 Easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:21:47 Richard, you get inventor when. You invent logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:32 We could have made do without them
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:38 We need logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:41 >:/
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:23:00 We've been asking for almost a year at this point, we require it
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:07 The more freedom/complex things you allow your players to use to create things, the more complex and unique things your players can invent
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:27 Logic gates will just be the greatest thing to be added to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:27:04 Well, the greatest single thing added to plane crazy. Not better than rockets and blocks but better than almost everything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:31:25 Anyways how much more do we have to bully Richard until he decides that it's better to just add logic gates just to get us to stop bullying him
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:11 Should we bully him harder by pinging him?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:32 Not spam ping of course
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:44 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:33:12 You ping him because I have nothing to lose except my existence here
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:06 I've pinged him before, so I shall do it myself
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:35 I'm scared now
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:37 Hec
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:49 What
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:36:09 Oh so he's a bitch?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:43:33 You should make...
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:43:50 You already know what I'm gonna say <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:44:31 I never use those because aesthetics are for STUPIDS
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:45:12 Maybe you should use your time for something my revolutionary <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
the-dump 2019-09-12 14:54:15 Burritos are the Mexican version of sushi
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:06:50 Do water propellers produce *any* thrust out of the water?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:08:20 Wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:00 Heeeey Rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:21 Take the logic gates before 2020 challenge
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:31 All the cool kids are doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:08:11 Yeah, it's not easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:08:16 It's REALLY easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:09:29 And only 2 more magnets and it teleports
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:11:32 <#507673335816126509> (to the one about inverted motor 2s) just turn it around lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:02:01 Cacus
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:02:48 Is anybody here a high school freshman?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:06 Either walk through the halls correctly or die
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:09 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:11 -senior
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:04:23 But yes, freshmen in high school. Either walk correctly through high school or delete yourself
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:04 Python language superior
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:18 Python is amazing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:26 I've created all kinds of things with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:30 Lua is AWFUL
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:33 Believe me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:37 I'm great at lua
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:39 And python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:50 But python, you need to understand, is AMAZINF
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:16 Lua's structuring is bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:29 Because it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:55 It's not bad, it's AWFUL
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:44 It requires you to do "end" at the end of stacks. It requires "do" instead of "then" and vice versa only depending on function
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:46 It's just bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:48 And inefficient
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:28 Python has a lot more libraries, and USEFUL ones
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:45 There's a reason python is famous among machine learning people
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:54 It has tensorflow
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:02 It has numpy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:04 It's amazing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:30 He's just getting blasted with reason and he's just saying "??" As if that's helping him
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:43 Python is superior to most languages
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:50 A library
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:01 The thing you asked me to staye
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:20 You asked me to give examples of good libraries, and I said tensor flow and bumpy and so many others
general 2019-09-12 18:57:47 Add logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:23 If he isn't, then oof
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:53 But that's why I never build aesthetic things. The prettiest thing I have built is a noob helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:16 Fonk no thonk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:41 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:46 Can you ban yourself?
general 2019-09-13 02:21:57 man, Joe Biden is getting memed by people so hard in the democratic debate rn
general 2019-09-13 03:33:36 
general 2019-09-13 14:40:36 
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:17:31 Speaking of peak
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:17:40 Rickje should add logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:44:45 Oh God a furry
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:44:47 Destroy it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:09 Weeb furries
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:10 Die
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:47 Weebs are just people who are bad* <@340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:05 It's not discriminatory
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:19 Because girls aren't real <@414954293448146974>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:50 Girls are a myth created by tampon companies to sell more tampons
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:27:32 How do I invent die?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:27:58 I already tried that <@238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:28:03 He only gets mad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:28:51 Furry bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:02 Furry very bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:09 Oi
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:11 Rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:15 Political question
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:18 Are furries bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:38 Ayyyy
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:46 I don't want to be but somebody brought it up
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:56 So I must cleanse the heretics
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:05 By proving them wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:13 Ah so I see you're wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:15 Sad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:18 Jk
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:36 They can be furries but they have to take their "OwO"s to a furry server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:59 Rick, made "OwO" illegal in this server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:31:16 Wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:31:19 I quoted it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:22 Yes but he was probably ironic
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:47 Because I've seen Rick display himself as a fellow intellectual
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:50 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:59 Rick said it was Photoshop so it's true
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:33:02 It's how it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:33:32 So do I but I don't abuse them
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:34:43 Why do people go on private servers when there's nothing but 3000 block creations and laggy st*ff
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 01:37:39 my doctor said my heart was fucked up because of how dehydrated it was so i decided to get myself addicted to caffein
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 01:37:42 now im good
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 14:51:22 You can still only use 4 of the sides though
general 2019-09-16 16:07:10 It isn't?
general 2019-09-16 18:45:33 
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:16:21 I don't mean to get political or anything, but is a burrito just a Mexican copy of sushi?
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:44:37 I was put into a presumably danish Roblox server and the only words I could recognise were "lol" and "noob"
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:44:48 Interesting how internet culture can cross language barriers
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 21:35:31 Imagine how big the creations would be if the plot sizes were twice as big. You could for 2^2 times the amount of stuff in it
general 2019-09-16 22:57:46 
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:32:07 when non-native english speaking english teachers teach their students how to pronounce english, do they teach them how to pronounce it as British, Scotish, Irish, Australian, or American

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:17 Did you know that the British were planning on making an aircraft carrier out of an iceberg because they were poor at the time
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:40 Because you make fully working ice sculptures of things you can't afford
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:58 But make it over 3x as large as a normal aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:23:05 Ye

plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:08 Wrong, the propeller in the back provides for better and easier control
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:12 And more efficient too
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:24 Don't have to sacrifice lift for turning

plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:12:13 Furries have stupid
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:12:45 There's a reason there anime and furry content is illegal in all of the servers that I'm an HR in
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:05 Because there's a better place for anime and furry content: DMs
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:10 What

general 2019-09-24 15:10:04 Today is America day. Not sure of it's an official holiday or if it's just a thing my school does as part as spirit week
general 2019-09-24 15:10:31 I remembered because a teacher with a mug with the American flag on it yelled "America!" In the halls
general 2019-09-24 16:04:16 Speaking of America day, this guy in class is wearing the hottest outfit I've ever seen
general 2019-09-24 16:04:40 Like, imagine a dude wearing a bra and shorts and that bra + shorts has the American flag printed on them
general 2019-09-24 16:04:45 And a farmers hat

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:49:24 And this time, no idea

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:06:29 Help
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:07:55 Oh, the reason is because it's spirit week, meaning every day we ~~stray further from god~~ wear a different style of clothes

Bully Rickje into adding logic gates to plane crazy before 2020
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:48:40 Yeah, carl-bot is a prick, he downvotes literally every suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:14 Confirmee
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:32 I'm not gonna play plane crazy until he adds logic gates or if he gets sad
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:48 Prove it
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:53 Send me your tears
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:10:42 I would also play plane crazy if rickje added a motor function that makes the motor always point upwards
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:18:12 Rickje, add non-lifting and reverse-lifting wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:18:17 Or I will get angry
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:19:15 And I'm assuming that the wings cause an upward loft no matter what way they are facing, which is why I'm suggesting reverse-lifting wingpanels
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:19:48 Tail wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:20:20 Real life planes use reverse-lifting wing panels on the tail wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:20:38 That's how planes can keep their main lifting wings so far back
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:21:00 Well you didn't take a class in aeronautics
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:21:28 Reverse lifting tail wings push the tail down,
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:22:03 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:22:45 The tail wings are actively pushing the tail down, because the main wings are usually behind the center of mass, meaning you need reverse lifting wings behind the main wings to push the center of lift foreward
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:23:44 The only reason you would have upwards-lifting tail wings is if your center of mass is behind your main wings, which is a HORRIBLE design
general 2019-09-27 15:12:38 Today is camo day at school, meaning you are supposed to wear camo and like half the people are gone today wtf
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 18:49:54 <#490306593242611742> I wonder how compressed I can make data

general 2019-10-07 16:12:10 And the people marveled at it, a quote from my friend;
"HOW TF YOUR DINGDONG FLY SO GOOD"
general 2019-10-07 16:17:21 Because everybody knows who those people are referring to
general 2019-10-07 16:55:58 
general 2019-10-07 18:57:01 
general 2019-10-07 20:40:48 What? lol
general 2019-10-08 04:28:42 you know how birds have been walking on 2 legs for FAR longer than us?
general 2019-10-08 04:28:57 i wonder if that means, if given enough time, humans will evolve to have birdlegs
general 2019-10-08 15:13:44 
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 17:23:19 I wonder what society would be like if girls were real
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 17:24:10 We would probably have unicornsz you don't know
general 2019-10-08 19:24:11 Don't ask who Joe is.
general 2019-10-08 19:32:23 <@327499289595084800> Joe mama
general 2019-10-09 03:29:17 what is that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:00:42 Sounds like something a 12 year old would say
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:31 Ah so it's still against TOS because it's a legal thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:37 <@327499289595084800>
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:52 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:59 And you were 12 yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:05 And today
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:25 And we don't want our discord getting deleted over you
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:46 So thank you for endangering the discord for illegally being here
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:51 Now begone
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:03:00 Discord admins would
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:03:22 Because of they found that we allowed 12 year olds here, then we would get in big trouble
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:04:03 Yeah who cares Bout that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:04:31 He is breaking discord TOS just by owning an account and we can't have that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:05:50 <@327499289595084800> you gonna ban him or nah?
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:06:13 He's 12 years old and the Discord can delete this server if we have 12 year olds here
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:06:52 I mean he's still illegal
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:07:27 You know how Twitter bans people who change their birthday to be above 13? Discord does the same because he broke TOS
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:07:41 So he would still be illegal in a week
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:09:10 Bruh I'm trying to make sure the discord is safe by making sure this underage guy gets banned
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:34 Minimods are people who want to be moderators and who are overly strict about everything
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:49 I don't want to be a mod, and I don't tattle on tiny things
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:57 So therefore, me no mini mod
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:12:53 And if I wanted to be a mod, I would apply for them, but I just like being here to talk to people, the mods that are here already do a fantastic job
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:15:06 Banning true minimodding is good, like I was in this server that actively encouraged minimodders so when I was having a conversation with this person I had like 3 guys warning me for "swearing" when I said things like "poop" and "stupid" and GOD FORBID you say "crap"
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:15:56 Fuck bitches, get money
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 17:41:25 Swear to gosh

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:41:37 fun fact; by far the largest portion of contraband brought to airports intended to be brought on planes, are fruits and vegetables that the united states has banned
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:42:33 yes, theres always someone who already know
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:42:42 doesnt mean you have to announce that you do
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:44:32 fun fact #2: chest nut trees are probably one of the best

plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:25:24 magnet cannons dont have recoil because things and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:26:23 i designed like a minigun, shot like 40 balls within 5 seconds, could probably be useful for taking down planes since it has a lot of spewage, whatever its called

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:13:04 no because youre not russian
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:14:04 no no, japan is still at war with russia since world war 2 since russia claims some of japans islands and they dont like that

plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:32:47 i can use magnets as a plane catapult
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:32:52 oh, dang
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:33:36 rick, i recommend using a sigmoid function for lift so that when planes go like 14 billion studs per second the wings dont completely destroy the plane
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:36:59 basically the sigmoid function would look like this:
(1/1+math.exp((-x/6)*range/2+range/2))*lift range

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:31 they were cool, but definitely not good
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:50 like, imagine designing a tank that can house naval armaments
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:53 thats fuckin cool
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:38:00 now imagine genocide

plane-crazy 2019-12-11 05:45:46 like think about it, you got the surveillance police state of china, the united states and other European places with cool gadgets that allow you to access the entirety of human knowledge but also an insanely huge wealth gap, and Russia where there are secret military ops and stuff.

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:10:14 during todays math test, the teacher made us label the axis' for the graphs and i set them to infinity and negative infinity so that even though it was a curved line, i only had to make a linear line from (-inf,-inf) to (+inf, +inf).
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:10:18 get nae naed teacher
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:01 yeah graphing calculators psh
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:19 not as cool as doing (-inf, -inf) and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:31 im in advanced pre calculus, which is all about infinites
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:41 so the teacher should have seen that someone would have done this some day
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:13:04 its pre calculus and then actual calculus next semester
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:13:28 mean while normal pre calculus is review of stuff first semester and then pre calculus second sem

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:15:41 my teacher is strict about showing work

general 2020-01-13 18:17:53 Can we get some Fs in the chat for my man Michael

general 2020-01-13 20:08:02 I was just in a class that i had with Michael. The people that used to sit with him we're so quiet and looked sad
general 2020-01-13 20:08:07 Made me feel bad
general 2020-01-13 20:10:16 Hes a kid at my school who died
general 2020-01-13 20:10:35 He died on Saturday due to a car crash due to the snow
general 2020-01-13 20:11:45 I didn't know him personally but I was in a class with him and it was so quiet and sad
general 2020-01-13 20:11:53 And it's the loudest and most annoying class I have
general 2020-01-13 20:12:12 Well they drive care

general 2020-01-13 20:13:09 That's more of a human response
general 2020-01-13 20:13:20 Humans get quiet for some reason when somebody dies
general 2020-01-13 20:13:43 And we associate quiet with dark so it feels darker
general 2020-01-13 20:13:52 So I see why they would say that
general 2020-01-13 20:17:03 Bruh what
general 2020-01-13 20:17:27 Oh, thiught you were accusing me of being happy that he died

Well the fucking principal comes in and starts asking everybody what theyre working on and me and my boys tell him about how we're working on a bill to abolish private property. So I tell him "dont worry im not actually a communist, its a joke" and HE FUCKING SAYS "Sure". So now my principal thinks im a communist.

general 2020-02-14 06:28:51 and my god, it is nothing like the movies
general 2020-02-14 06:28:58 or the common stereotype
general 2020-02-14 06:29:41 what the frankenstein book has in common with the frankenstein movies is that frankenstein makes a creature and that creature kills someone
general 2020-02-14 06:29:59 yes i know how to pronounce the things
general 2020-02-14 06:30:20 <@!454570394343702529> i was listing similarities between the book and the movies
general 2020-02-14 06:31:05 like, frankenstein doesnt even say "ITS ALIIIVE!!!"
general 2020-02-14 06:31:13 he literally sees it look at him and runs away
general 2020-02-14 06:31:30 and i just feel so bad for the creature
general 2020-02-14 06:31:42 like he just gets abandoned at "birth"

general 2020-02-14 06:31:51 <@!454570394343702529> did you read the book?
general 2020-02-14 06:32:00 damn, that sucks
general 2020-02-14 06:32:59 because like i said, the only thing that the book has in common is that the guys name is frankenstein, and that he creates a creature, and that creature murders someone. theres literally NOTHING ELSE thats similar, not the details, maybe locations but thats about it
general 2020-02-14 06:33:19 <@!444441978697154561> read it, it gets surprisingly good at around chapter 9

general 2020-02-14 06:35:46 ok, good
general 2020-02-14 06:36:46 anyways, i founded a communist party in my debate class because we're about to do a congress simulation, and we're going to abolish private property
general 2020-02-14 06:37:06 i founded it to oppose the "naki party"
general 2020-02-14 06:37:19 if we have a communist party, take a guess what the naki party is
general 2020-02-14 06:37:44 the name is a hint

general 2020-02-14 06:38:46 oh
general 2020-02-14 06:38:52 i said the bad word
general 2020-02-14 06:39:22 he was unironically ***cough*** nationalist in the 1930s-40s sense
general 2020-02-14 06:39:28 germany
general 2020-02-14 06:39:30 specifically
general 2020-02-14 06:40:22 well, at first he was ironically, but then he wasnt, and then he got suspended and investigated by the FBI because he spread national socialist propaganda around a black church advocating for a race war. so i would rather not do what he did
general 2020-02-14 06:40:34 im only communist 1 hour of the day, and thats debate hour

general 2020-02-16 04:53:14 sure
general 2020-02-16 04:53:33 i invented a rope launcher with port and starboard attachments
general 2020-02-16 04:53:51 <@!224513422161739776> wait, so its literally impossible to become an inventor anymore?
general 2020-02-16 04:54:07 jeez
general 2020-02-16 04:54:30 oof lmao
general 2020-02-16 04:54:57 so basically inventor rank is just "veteran" rank now?
general 2020-02-16 04:55:18 and how long ago did they stop giving inventor role?
general 2020-02-16 04:55:38 did he say that it did?
general 2020-02-16 04:55:42 oof
general 2020-02-16 04:55:58 oh
general 2020-02-16 04:55:59 lmao
general 2020-02-16 04:56:21 isnt caliber based on the ratio between bullet and barrel size?
general 2020-02-16 04:57:56 i wonder how long until rickje finally gives in and adds logic gates and sensors
general 2020-02-16 04:58:05 ive been nagging him about it literally for 2 years now
general 2020-02-16 05:16:22 We're doing a congress simulation in debate class at school and i'm considering making a bill to abolish congress just to see what would happen.
general 2020-02-16 05:16:50 yeah
general 2020-02-16 05:17:53 and i know that the bill would pass because i founded the "peoples republican party", better known as the communist party, and we currently have a majority of the senators in congress

general 2020-02-21 01:35:00 i was making some tea and some missionaries came to the door
general 2020-02-21 01:35:19 and i didnt have the heart to tell them i was an atheist so i just kept talking to them for a while and now i have this mini bible and a card with a phone number on it.
general 2020-02-21 01:35:39 "mini bible" its a pamphlet of (im assuming) some bible verses
general 2020-02-21 01:43:05 but god, the missionary visit really caught me off guard
general 2020-02-21 01:43:12 like i was so awkward when we were talking lmao
general 2020-02-21 01:43:21 but i kept my cool a bit
general 2020-02-21 01:43:38 we never, ever get visitors down here
general 2020-02-21 07:14:12 are there any mormons here? because i need to know if im wrong:
general 2020-02-21 17:13:09 I feel like my debate teacher is judging me

general 2020-02-22 05:12:33 The senior classes get the most photographers from the photography class

general 2020-02-22 05:13:16 feels a little awkward, but its coolio
general 2020-02-22 06:06:16 so i founded the "peoples republican party" in debate during our simulation of congress and right now we have over 2 thirds of the senators and since im the leader everyone listens to me and im literally the most powerful man in the universe

general 2020-02-23 05:21:20 jails make room for new prisoners not because they are nearly full, but because they get back student test scores, and they can make a guess of how many more people are going to be in prison. Your bed in prison is made before you even graduate high school.

general 2020-02-26 06:19:47 im debating whether or not i should make a complex-mathematics module
general 2020-02-26 06:20:02 and by complex i mean imaginary numbers + real numbers
general 2020-02-26 06:20:26 but then i would have to do octonions
general 2020-02-26 06:20:51 is there another number higher than octonions?
general 2020-02-26 06:21:20 looked it up, there are. Sedenions
general 2020-02-26 06:21:29 but it seems thats as high as it goes
general 2020-02-26 06:21:46 so should i create a sedenion-mathematics module <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-02-26 06:22:18 but even in the real world so few people use sedenions
general 2020-02-26 06:22:26 like, only theoretical physicists really use them
general 2020-02-26 06:22:50 and so few people use sedenions that nobody has bothered to go beyond that

plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:48:16 bruh if aircraft carriers are so afraid of missiles, just put the entire aircraft carrier underwater and have them resurface when they need to launch planes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:49:44 yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:49:49 thats why the aircraft carrier does
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:49 thats why planes arent just in the water normally
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:57 theyre in an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:51:44 torpedos move a lot slower, so its easy to have anti-torpedos
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:52:35 yes, small torpedos that go toward the torpedo and blow up
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:53:21 how would that work
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:05 so you're suggesting having torpedos that are small and use those against the aircraft carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:25 even though the reason that the original torpedos would be big is to carry enough explosives?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:58 so just add more anti-torps
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:57:00 therye small enough
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:57:13 they only need to be large enough to blow up a torpedo, not an entire ship

bug-reports 2020-03-26 01:09:25 If you have too many wings, or move too quickly with wings, they spaz out and glitch your plane to the far lands and out of existance.
Speculation: The wing panel lift equation might cause a positive feedback loop, where if there are enough wings, or going fast enough, it causes the wing to spaz, which would be seen as a lot of momentum, causing the wings to lift in the opposite direction, this time with more force due to the massive momentum, and so on and so forth.
If this is the case, then you could fix this by making the lift function not go above a certain limit, easiest way to do this is with a non linear function. My suggestion: Sigmoid[1/(1+2[the higher this is, the faster it will change while approaching 0]^-x)]

general 2020-04-14 23:35:27 cats really hate being followed
general 2020-04-14 23:35:48 you start following them, they speed up, you speed up, they speed up more, they speed up more until its eventually full on sprinting
general 2020-04-14 23:35:49 like why
general 2020-04-14 23:35:54 im just curious what cat do
general 2020-04-14 23:36:21 im the wrong guy to ask
general 2020-04-14 23:36:33 the most detailed build ive made is a flying noob
general 2020-04-14 23:36:51 ask somebody who knows how to make something look good
general 2020-04-14 23:36:55 because that aint me
general 2020-04-15 23:30:50 is anybody here british because i have a question

general 2020-04-15 23:36:11 im technically a british citizen but i live in america because thats where i was born
general 2020-04-15 23:36:37 americanese
general 2020-04-15 23:36:58 i also have american citizenship because i was born here
general 2020-04-15 23:37:04 but my dad is from england
general 2020-04-15 23:37:10 so i also have british citizenship
general 2020-04-15 23:38:05 my mom was american, my dad was british, and im the only person in my family other than my mother who was born in the united states
general 2020-04-15 23:38:31 i wonder if that means i can vote in british elections despite me living in america <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-04-16 06:38:41 apology for bad english

general 2020-04-16 18:07:45 idk what powder youre talking about, but when i make noodles i eat the noodles raw, drink the water and snort the flavor powder
general 2020-04-16 19:22:29 hmm

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:35:31 has anybody made a german uboat yet? <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:03 modern submarines look dumb
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:07 whale lookin ass
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:25 uboats were cool because they were boats but underwater
general 2020-04-17 01:51:03 if all laws were abolished and nobody in the public was made aware, i wonder how long it would take for society to figure it out
general 2020-04-17 01:51:22 how so?
general 2020-04-17 01:51:34 its not like police would come to arrest them
general 2020-04-17 01:51:41 what
general 2020-04-17 01:53:55 explain the chain of events that it would take for the public to realize
general 2020-04-17 01:54:08 because people would just start getting away with everything that used to be illegal
general 2020-04-17 01:54:14 they wouldnt know that it currently ISNT illegal
general 2020-04-17 01:54:54 the only law is that police and government officials arent allowed to tell the public about laws no longer existing
general 2020-04-17 01:55:33 i think i twould take a litle longer
general 2020-04-17 01:55:42 in ideal conditions maybe a month
general 2020-04-17 04:33:29 what does init(innit?) mean?
general 2020-04-17 04:33:32 its a british word
general 2020-04-17 06:53:08 oh boy guns! that definitely wont stir up a bunch of controversial arguments in the chat!

the-dump 2020-04-18 06:50:04 but let me fucking tell you, i really, really wish i did
the-dump 2020-04-18 06:51:13 im really pissed off that this happened my senior year
the-dump 2020-04-18 06:51:24 all of the fun and actually interesting stuff was happening this year
the-dump 2020-04-18 06:51:40 i was supposed to make a fucking rocket plane in physics class, which nobody else was allowed to do
the-dump 2020-04-18 06:52:14 and now, after doing school for 12 years, i get my diploma in the mail

the-dump 2020-04-19 00:32:00 i remember when i played a KKK game and the HRs thought i was black, so they put me in the cotton picking fields, and then lynched me after i was done
the-dump 2020-04-19 00:34:21 it was an interesting experience
general 2020-04-19 06:39:19 it can barely move, yet do programming stuff
general 2020-04-19 06:39:42 it literally just relies on food to swim close to it, and ambushes it

the-dump 2020-04-23 17:06:06 whats the point of arranged marriage? maximizing the chance of divorce?
general 2020-04-29 22:49:32 wait is the country with the cheese, beer, and tea called England, or Britain
general 2020-04-29 22:49:49 i never learned what its official name is
general 2020-04-29 22:50:00 god does anybody know anymore
general 2020-04-30 20:43:49 imagine an alien civilization whos language is already so information-dense that it cant be datacompressed
general 2020-04-30 20:43:55 like, they could say a paragraph in a word
general 2020-04-30 20:44:53 thats multiple words written in a dumb fassion
general 2020-04-30 20:47:05 the best way to do datacompression is do what the library of babel did and just make an algorithm that can randomly generate any possible creation, and then put the creation that the player made into the inverse of the random generation function and just get the key back
general 2020-04-30 20:47:41 dont have to
general 2020-04-30 20:47:51 you just put the key in and it randomly generates what you created
general 2020-04-30 20:48:45 the library of babel doesnt store every possible thing that humans can ever write, it just randomly generates it from a key, and you can search for a book by using the inverse of the randomly generation function and it gives you a key
general 2020-04-30 20:49:07 you literally dont have to store any data
general 2020-04-30 20:49:21 the only data you have to store is the key, and the random generation function
general 2020-04-30 20:49:43 the library of babel is really, really cool
general 2020-04-30 20:49:50 vsauce did a video on the library of babel
general 2020-04-30 20:50:39 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrBIKOR01c& 17:01
general 2020-04-30 20:50:55 he explains the library of babel
general 2020-04-30 20:56:12 guys, i wanna show you how amazing the library of babel is
general 2020-04-30 20:56:16 go here: https://libraryofbabel.info/
general 2020-04-30 20:56:34 heck the key is too long
general 2020-04-30 20:58:51 its not encryption
general 2020-04-30 20:58:56 its randomly generated numbers
general 2020-04-30 20:59:13 it occasionally gets lucky and makes something thats readable
general 2020-04-30 20:59:23 thats why you use the "search" function
general 2020-05-01 08:42:57 i wonder how long until someone makes an actual helicopter
general 2020-05-01 08:43:12 not one with two blades, or some cheaty method
general 2020-05-01 08:43:58 why not?
general 2020-05-01 08:44:31 thats what i mean
general 2020-05-01 08:44:45 people use 2 main blades that counteract their spin
general 2020-05-01 08:44:55 which is cheaty but i understand why
general 2020-05-01 08:45:17 real helicopters use a secondary blade in the back to stop them from spinning
general 2020-05-01 08:45:43 because plane crazy is *bad*
general 2020-05-01 08:45:49 ill fuckin make one
general 2020-05-01 08:46:04 yes
general 2020-05-01 08:47:07 thats the idea
general 2020-05-01 08:47:13 1 main blade and a back blade
general 2020-05-01 08:48:48 oh
general 2020-05-01 08:48:48 wait
general 2020-05-01 08:48:54 i dont make aesthetic builds
general 2020-05-01 08:48:59 i make purely functional builds
general 2020-05-01 08:49:09 i dont make things to look pretty
general 2020-05-01 08:49:19 i make things that do a job
general 2020-05-01 16:52:33 im creating an actual helicopter, not the dumb double blade helicopter that everyone else makes
general 2020-05-01 16:53:05 its kinda unstable, but whenever rick adds logic gates, the helicopters should be really easy to make stable
general 2020-05-01 16:54:29 eventually yes
general 2020-05-01 16:54:45 we asked for them over a year ago but apparently theyre ahard to do
general 2020-05-01 16:54:52 but he said "eventually"
general 2020-05-01 16:56:33 what?
general 2020-05-01 16:56:47 oof
general 2020-05-01 16:57:01 rickje never gives us the cool stuff >:/
general 2020-05-01 16:58:56 bruh i just want logic gates
general 2020-05-01 16:59:02 logic gates would be revolutionary
general 2020-05-01 16:59:57 rick wouldnt lie that bad
general 2020-05-01 17:01:47 is there a gamepass?
general 2020-05-01 17:01:55 oh
general 2020-05-01 17:02:12 he said "that affect gameplay"
general 2020-05-01 17:02:24 speakers are just there for annoying people
general 2020-05-01 17:02:37 they dont add or subtract from gameplay
general 2020-05-01 17:02:55 if he made a warp drive gamepass then yes, that would very much affect gameplay
general 2020-05-01 17:11:50 no
general 2020-05-01 17:12:06 define corrupt
general 2020-05-02 02:45:24 bruh i think the quarantine is driving Elon Musk insane
general 2020-05-02 02:45:34 he never struck me as the super patriotic type
general 2020-05-06 00:43:31 Fun fact: Nobody called them murder hornets until the media found out there was a single dead one in America
general 2020-05-06 06:20:06 Am I fucked up for thinking that no matter how hard we try, humans will inevitably be whipped out by AI, so we might as well make an AI that is best suited for taking over and controlling the universe as possible?
general 2020-05-06 17:39:07 I eat
general 2020-05-06 17:39:11 aaaaa

general 2020-05-07 17:46:44 is stealing a kid morally wrong if youre a better parent than their originals
general 2020-05-07 17:47:30 oh yeah they have an entire government thing based around stealking kids from bad parents

general 2020-05-08 08:41:17 thats a good unit of data measurment
general 2020-05-08 08:41:41 up is very smart
general 2020-05-08 08:42:04 you have to thonk about it a lot to see what i did

plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:33:46 but rickje made an update which made it crash every time it loaded in
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:35:43 my cannon took up my entire plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:01 im pretty sure i posted a couple pictures here
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:44 thats barely a cannon
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:57 its a cool replica though
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:16 but you wouldnt understand how awesome my suspension cannon looked while loading and firing
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:28 it even had recoil supression
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:35 god i miss it
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:38:16 every little bit of it served a purpose, none of it went to aesthetic, yet it still managed to look (no better word for it, sorry) epic
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 21:13:02 AAAA we've been waiting 1 and a half years for logic gates and sensors

general 2020-06-12 06:42:02 thanks

general 2020-06-26 19:34:44 i just had an epiphany
general 2020-06-26 19:35:01 evolution is just a very complicated folding competition
general 2020-06-26 19:35:24 the genetics that are the best at folding proteins into a creature wins
general 2020-06-26 19:35:32 it all makes sense now
general 2020-06-26 19:37:27 how do you reproduce?
general 2020-06-26 19:37:33 you first have to be folded into existance
general 2020-06-26 19:37:38 case and point
general 2020-06-26 19:37:39 boom
general 2020-06-26 19:38:04 so basically
general 2020-06-26 19:38:17 the genetics that are the best at folding up a fucking machine wins <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

general 2020-07-03 22:08:44 and thats only what they did overnight, since i dont use the computer that i have them on for anything, i could literally just forget about them and come back in like a month to find them fighting demons from the underworld and winning
general 2020-07-03 22:08:51 i could

general 2020-07-10 03:27:02 i speak stupid
general 2020-07-10 03:27:22 no
general 2020-07-10 03:27:49 still no
general 2020-07-10 03:28:12 it has infinite volume as well as infinite perimeter
general 2020-07-10 03:28:37 he said a spiral
general 2020-07-10 03:28:43 like a 3d object
general 2020-07-10 03:28:50 so therefore, volume
general 2020-07-10 03:29:24 oh you mean looking at a spiral vertically
general 2020-07-10 03:29:27 ah, that
general 2020-07-10 03:29:39 problem is a true spiral has no volume
general 2020-07-10 03:29:44 er
general 2020-07-10 03:29:46 not volume
general 2020-07-10 03:29:58 whatever this toxic asshole says
general 2020-07-10 03:35:06 oh god
general 2020-07-10 03:35:33 someone who acts like undr(if im remembering the right person) can be as old as 18?
general 2020-07-10 03:36:01 oh
general 2020-07-10 03:36:06 yeah i guess that makes sense
general 2020-07-10 03:36:13 aint it 13 in japan
general 2020-07-10 08:54:03 i just find it so fascinating that you can start with random numbers connected to eachother and given enough time they can learn to be better at swordfighting than humans
general 2020-07-10 08:54:10 like my neural network bots
general 2020-07-10 08:54:26 well, theyre not quite as good as humans with experience yet
general 2020-07-10 08:54:30 ai place?
general 2020-07-10 08:54:31 what
general 2020-07-10 08:55:38 i bet these AIs are hardcoded
general 2020-07-10 08:55:48 i've seen hardcoded swordfighting ai before, though i wanna see
general 2020-07-10 08:55:51 laaAAAme
general 2020-07-10 08:56:02 tryhards aint trying hard enough
general 2020-07-10 08:56:22 when stephen figures it out he wont only fucking know how to swordfight the best against the average joe
general 2020-07-10 08:56:44 he has memory neurons meaning he can theoretically adapt to your tactics in real time
general 2020-07-10 08:57:14 cant, unless i get the owners permission
general 2020-07-10 08:57:55 since im not running it to play in games
general 2020-07-10 08:58:04 im teaching it to play in a roblox game that its implimented in
general 2020-07-10 08:58:57 woah, while i had the game open it slowed down my own sword fighting bots a lot
general 2020-07-10 08:59:14 since i kinda run a lot of them at a time, to make their training time efficient
general 2020-07-10 08:59:32 so i literally have nothing running except them
general 2020-07-10 08:59:40 they dont copy you, they adapt to you
general 2020-07-10 09:00:00 meaning if you play like a noob, they will beat you like they would to a noob
general 2020-07-10 09:00:25 theoretically yes
general 2020-07-10 09:00:33 might take a while for them to evolve for that but maybe
general 2020-07-10 09:01:21 since i give them ways to communicate with themself(aka thinking more than simply reflexing)
general 2020-07-10 09:01:47 so depending on your definition, my stephens are very slightly conscious. about as conscious as a particularly small worm
general 2020-07-10 09:02:14 machine learning is fun
general 2020-07-10 09:02:24 especially when you can watch them learn real time
general 2020-07-10 09:03:56 im thinking of making a targeting type thing for a specific game, im just trying to get the owners permission
general 2020-07-10 09:04:35 its not an exploit since nothing is injected into the games code, and its not a cheat because it doesnt do anything thats impossible for a human to do(like an autoclicker for example)
general 2020-07-10 09:05:05 it just analyzes the screen, identifies enemies, friendlies, and neutrals
general 2020-07-10 09:05:11 you spammed and the bot deleted it
general 2020-07-10 09:05:27 what grade are you?
general 2020-07-10 09:06:06 so a freshman?
general 2020-07-10 09:06:09 no a sophomore
general 2020-07-10 09:06:23 well i graduated high school this year
general 2020-07-10 09:06:36 believe it or not i only learned how to code at the end of my sophomore year
general 2020-07-10 09:07:13 because i really wanted to try machine learning, and over the last few years ive been doing trial and error and now i think im pretty good with machine learning. as good as you can get being entirely self taught at least
general 2020-07-10 09:07:27 if you want, you can have my neural network module that i built
general 2020-07-10 09:07:33 its free for anyone to take
general 2020-07-10 09:08:11 learning coding is not at all learning a new language
general 2020-07-10 09:08:50 learning coding is basically learning how to tell a particularly obedient baby the small steps it needs to take to do something complicated
general 2020-07-10 09:09:16 no
general 2020-07-10 09:09:24 computers and babies arent smart on their own
general 2020-07-10 09:09:33 if the person who programs them is smart, then they can act smart
general 2020-07-10 09:10:05 or if the person is *particularly* good, not only act smart, but actually be smart
general 2020-07-10 09:10:27 i dont have much experience programming outside of roblox
general 2020-07-10 09:10:41 ill take a software engineering class in college
general 2020-07-10 09:11:35 i dont have any experience programming robots, though my school did have a robotics club
general 2020-07-10 09:11:55 i probably could have done something interesting with the robotics club but i was an idiot and never did any clubs
general 2020-07-10 09:12:22 except debate, which surprisingly even for a rather reserved guy like myself was *really* fun
general 2020-07-10 09:12:56 i mean yeah all the extremist ideologies concentrate there; communism, anarcho capitalism, transhumanitarianism. you name it
general 2020-07-10 09:13:40 noob
general 2020-07-10 09:13:52 if you dont learn to be sociable you will be miserable, trust me
general 2020-07-10 09:13:59 thats precisely why i took debate
general 2020-07-10 09:14:05 to get better at talking to people
general 2020-07-10 09:14:08 and it worked well
general 2020-07-10 09:14:24 oh god i've programmed everything in lua
general 2020-07-10 09:15:23 i should really move on to programming things outside of roblox, but for right now im perfectly fine programming absurdly complex(for roblox's standards) projects in literally a childrens lego game
general 2020-07-10 09:16:08 i dont program games
general 2020-07-10 09:16:45 i exclusively do projects that i entirely create myself. like procedural ore generators, machine learning, probably something else im forgetting
general 2020-07-10 09:17:06 well, other than the game im making for my own group
general 2020-07-10 09:17:11 easy
general 2020-07-10 09:17:20 cframe is bad btw, never do cframe
general 2020-07-10 09:18:55 looks pretty nice
general 2020-07-10 09:19:20 inspired by quantum science im guessing?
general 2020-07-10 09:20:07 finding motivation isnt simple
general 2020-07-10 09:20:33 for me, i own a really old community and i want to make it as powerful as it once was, and i'm basically doing everything i can to do it
general 2020-07-10 09:21:31 thats because it *is*
general 2020-07-10 09:21:36 stolen directly from it
general 2020-07-10 09:21:41 at least in QS's case
general 2020-07-10 09:22:39 my team is basically just working on a military base in a giant hole in the ground
general 2020-07-10 09:22:44 more impressive than it sounds though
general 2020-07-10 09:23:38 whats the reference for building it
general 2020-07-10 09:23:58 good
general 2020-07-10 09:24:10 nope
general 2020-07-10 09:24:25 oh
general 2020-07-10 09:25:50 that would be nice
general 2020-07-10 09:26:02 i cant afford to give anyone robux, so we just slowly build
general 2020-07-10 09:26:10 but i keep them inspired
general 2020-07-10 09:26:14 its coming along smoothly
general 2020-07-10 09:26:43 how did you find all these people
general 2020-07-10 09:27:11 who would the one from pinewood be
general 2020-07-10 09:27:27 name them all
general 2020-07-10 09:27:31 i bet i can recognise it
general 2020-07-10 09:27:48 thats fine
general 2020-07-10 09:28:47 but what i meant was, how did they all get there
general 2020-07-10 09:28:50 how did you collect them
general 2020-07-10 09:29:01 AH
general 2020-07-10 09:29:04 huntgamerpc
general 2020-07-10 09:31:03 did you invite the people to join? or did they just request to help
general 2020-07-10 09:31:39 so what do you have other than what looks like a reactor and a control room?
general 2020-07-10 09:32:06 ah, so you're finishing the build with the reactor?
general 2020-07-10 09:32:13 some people start with the reactor
general 2020-07-10 09:32:43 i mean, you're done with everything except the control room?
general 2020-07-10 09:33:58 interesting
general 2020-07-10 09:34:07 well, i have to go now, its getting rather late for me
general 2020-07-10 09:34:11 good night
general 2020-07-10 22:04:12 being an idiot?
general 2020-07-10 22:04:17 that looks like art to me i dunno
general 2020-07-10 22:05:53 lmao thats probably how abstract art happened
general 2020-07-10 22:05:59 "i dunno man that looks like art to me"
general 2020-07-10 22:43:09 god, my titan cannon had actual recoil suppression
general 2020-07-10 22:43:13 i still miss it
general 2020-07-10 22:43:25 its file was corrupted about a year ago
general 2020-07-10 22:43:29 sad times
the-dump 2020-07-11 04:32:44 
the-dump 2020-07-11 04:32:48 hammed burger :(
the-dump 2020-07-11 22:22:35 what is that
the-dump 2020-07-12 00:29:37 y'know, math might just be some weird thing that humans made
the-dump 2020-07-12 00:29:55 so if we make an AI, they might just go ahead and switch to a more effective thing than mathematics
the-dump 2020-07-12 00:30:00 math 2 electric boogaloo
the-dump 2020-07-13 02:40:28 <@!380926327210901506> that happens because of overflow(or underflow i think) where that function isnt meant to handle negative numbers, so when the number somehow goes negative it loops the byte all the way back around to 255
general 2020-07-13 06:29:52 hey ive got good news
general 2020-07-13 06:30:00 if AI kills us that means we arent in a simulation
general 2020-07-13 06:30:16 because the AI would want to verify that its not in a simulation before killing people
general 2020-07-13 06:30:36 so if it kills us, that means we can rest assured that we arent in a simulation
general 2020-07-13 06:31:55 i mean we would never get to know what that proof is that we are the actual first universe, but i personally say its worth it
the-dump 2020-07-14 08:07:54 eh pretty much the same
the-dump 2020-07-15 02:15:14 the dumb
the-dump 2020-07-15 20:40:39 nah its when some purple ass mf put a kid in an animatronic
the-dump 2020-07-15 21:19:44 yeah im talking about the one with purple guy not 83
the-dump 2020-07-15 21:20:13 eh well im not educated on the fredward lore stuff
the-dump 2020-07-18 20:42:18 does anybody know why "never gonna give you up" became the video that people "rick rolled" people with
general 2020-07-19 08:27:27 i wonder why people have such a fascination with the soviet union
general 2020-07-19 08:27:51 like, the scp community's alt-modern setting has the soviet union as a large factor
the-dump 2020-07-21 03:35:06 god damn
the-dump 2020-07-21 03:35:13 i see that video reposted every 30 minutes
the-dump 2020-07-21 03:35:23 it wasnt even funny the first time
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:24:04 my dad gave me a shot glass of ginger ale which had like .5% alchohol
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:24:10 am i an alcoholic now
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:26:14 cool
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:26:43 it tasted weird but thats only because it tasted like ginger(***surprise***) and im used to having ginger on sushi
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:27:19 i heard vodka sucks because it tastes like nothing but alcohol burning
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:27:27 because ***thats exactly what it is***
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:32:54 thats why you dont add noise to images
the-dump 2020-07-21 23:33:08 it makes it harder for compression algorithms to compress it
the-dump 2020-07-22 00:48:18 kill it
general 2020-07-22 01:46:46 i wonder what kind of abomination of a recipe you would have to make in front of the pope in order for him to make a call directly to god himself to let him know that you shouldnt be allowed anywhere near heaven and probably not even hell for the sake of the devil's mental health
general 2020-07-22 01:47:59 thats not a recipe
general 2020-07-22 01:49:50 mm i dunno
general 2020-07-22 01:49:59 real cheddar made in britain do be tasting good
general 2020-07-22 01:50:38 doesnt sound that bad
general 2020-07-22 01:50:42 also thats chinese not british
general 2020-07-22 02:12:39 btw what is england/the united kingdoms actual name
general 2020-07-22 02:12:45 is it england or the united kingdom
general 2020-07-22 02:12:49 idk
the-dump 2020-07-22 05:28:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498231187748159521/735366240973094983/video0-7.mp4
the-dump 2020-07-22 05:35:56 its fucking with my brain, thats what it is
general 2020-07-22 06:05:47 i wonder how quickly we would advance in science if reality was a video game
general 2020-07-22 06:06:17 like, in games you just dump like 80% of what you have into research and wait for somebody to attack you to churn out a super advanced military in 3 weeks
general 2020-07-22 06:06:30 imagine we did that in rea like
general 2020-07-22 06:07:27 80% of the USA's budget to research and 10% to the military for military-research getting ready for some day someone declares war on the USA with a bunch of factories that are used for other things then being used to churn out a military in 3 weeks
general 2020-07-22 06:07:46 they were built for war but are used for other things until war breaks out
general 2020-07-22 06:08:05 i bet we would have colonized mars by the time jesus was invented
general 2020-07-22 06:10:21 no because the game starts when the first human invented a stick that can poke some bugs
general 2020-07-22 06:10:36 actually no thats too early
general 2020-07-22 06:10:43 sticks that can poke other animals painfully
general 2020-07-22 06:10:45 there we go
general 2020-07-22 08:06:12 woah holy fuck
general 2020-07-22 08:06:18 since when was jeff bezos so rich
general 2020-07-22 08:06:27 he had like 100 billion last time i checked
general 2020-07-22 08:06:40 i look on twitter today and hes made 13 billion dollars in 24 hours
the-dump 2020-07-22 18:50:55 the mods are so attentive with this channel
the-dump 2020-07-22 18:51:15 like, i've never seen a post thats broken the rules because the mods get to it basically instantly
the-dump 2020-07-22 18:51:16 i love it

the-dump 2020-07-23 00:58:49 letor
the-dump 2020-07-23 01:15:05 i havent watched a top 10 in several years
the-dump 2020-07-23 02:03:15 whoever invented avocados is cool and should be given at least 7 dollars
general 2020-07-23 02:11:26 ay why is it that in children shows women voice guys but in adult shows men voice the women
general 2020-07-23 02:11:32 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-07-23 02:12:00 y'ever heard of timmy turner
general 2020-07-23 02:12:06 yeah he was voiced by a woman
general 2020-07-24 05:13:36 why do cats look so much better than dogs
general 2020-07-24 05:19:48 i dont take care of my cat other than petting him, feeding him, and watering him
general 2020-07-24 05:20:04 meanwhile i give my dog a bath every now and again and hes STILL ugly
general 2020-07-24 05:20:19 uglier than my cat*
general 2020-07-24 05:27:45 what is that
the-dump 2020-07-25 10:01:34 
general 2020-07-25 21:57:48 oi how do i download roblox for free no scam 2020 working
general 2020-07-25 22:45:09 fun fact: PC is better because PC can download emulators<:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-07-25 22:47:56 plan craz
general 2020-07-27 02:33:33 my chest hurts
general 2020-07-27 02:33:52 but it doesnt feel like its my heart, its like slightly to the right
general 2020-07-27 02:34:38 its the summer, its not dry
general 2020-07-27 02:35:43 it gets *moist* in the summer because when water evaporates it doesnt disappear
general 2020-07-27 02:35:47 it mixes with the air
the-dump 2020-07-27 06:38:04 this sounds like a satire
general 2020-07-27 19:47:58 ay does anybody know where lesbia is?
general 2020-07-27 19:48:05 this girl says shes lesbian but i cant find lesbia on the map
the-dump 2020-07-28 06:09:52 
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:03:37 i love myself
general 2020-07-28 23:24:14 i remember when roblox didnt have a filter
general 2020-07-28 23:24:25 am i a boomer
the-dump 2020-07-29 06:32:26 there was a video of a guy stomping a transgender person in the face
the-dump 2020-07-29 06:32:31 thats probably against the rules
the-dump 2020-07-29 06:39:03 its a bit far up
general 2020-07-29 06:40:55 <#529858892075761694> its been over a month since rick said something in there B(
general 2020-07-29 07:47:14 only cowards dont like blue cheese
the-dump 2020-07-29 16:14:50 who is rick may and how is reposting this bread honoring him
the-dump 2020-07-29 16:17:02 what about the bread part
the-dump 2020-07-29 16:17:33 or is it just a meme capitalizing on someones death
the-dump 2020-07-29 16:18:32 yeah, that sucks
general 2020-07-29 17:42:18 why are cats so good
general 2020-07-29 17:42:22 they just vibe
general 2020-07-29 17:42:35 father
general 2020-07-29 17:42:59 <@!327499289595084800> ay could you clear out these weirdos kthx
general 2020-07-29 17:43:51 ay i havent been active in this place in a while idk the etiquette
general 2020-07-29 17:44:03 sheeeit i used to ping rick back in the day
general 2020-07-29 17:44:26 i know not to ping rick and stuff
general 2020-07-29 17:44:33 though back then he didnt seem bothered by it
general 2020-07-29 17:44:57 damn
general 2020-07-29 17:45:03 2 years ago at this point
general 2020-07-29 17:45:08 time flies like a mf
general 2020-07-29 17:45:21 and we ***still*** dont have logic gates
general 2020-07-29 17:45:43 rick said he was going to add logic gates
general 2020-07-29 17:45:45 so hey
general 2020-07-29 17:45:55 2 years ago ;/
general 2020-07-29 17:46:45 when i first checked out plane crazy i thought it was just one of madattaks old forgotten cool little projects
general 2020-07-29 17:46:59 then i see it has a discord and i was like "oh, radically tubular lemme check this out"
general 2020-07-29 17:47:14 but yeah back when i came to plane crazy only like 40 people max were playing it
general 2020-07-29 17:47:41 and then i accidentally created a warp drive
general 2020-07-29 17:47:47 so that was fun
general 2020-07-29 17:48:17 it wasnt even the standard block attached to suspension, it was like some weird curved thing made out of pistons with a magnet below it
general 2020-07-29 17:48:26 what
general 2020-07-29 17:48:39 he wants to duck
general 2020-07-29 17:48:53 damn i wish i was a duck
general 2020-07-29 17:49:09 if i die and ducks eat me then i technically become duck
general 2020-07-29 17:49:10 so hey
general 2020-07-29 17:50:35 i remember how i lost my inventor rank for about 2 hours because i set my "playing" to something like "Roblox: Fuck Bitches edition" so they had to remove my rank so that people didnt see that lmao
general 2020-07-29 17:50:46 ah yes, the duck
general 2020-07-29 17:51:04 wait is swearing illegal here now
general 2020-07-29 17:51:07 cant remember
general 2020-07-29 17:51:33 ah
general 2020-07-29 17:51:43 neato
general 2020-07-29 17:51:43 ok so i didnt break the rules
general 2020-07-29 17:52:08 but if i tell someone "fuck" then its illegal because it was directed towards them specifically
general 2020-07-29 17:52:26 100% how it works
general 2020-07-29 17:52:56 i just realized that my first roblox account is older than some of the people in the games i play
general 2020-07-29 17:53:02 am i a boomer
general 2020-07-29 17:53:12 11 years old
general 2020-07-29 17:53:20 yes
general 2020-07-29 17:53:21 april
general 2020-07-29 17:53:44 soon my original account will be legally allowed to join discord
general 2020-07-29 17:53:51 just 2 more years
general 2020-07-29 17:54:54 when i made my account i was just here to play games, now adays i make artificial intelligence in roblox
general 2020-07-29 17:55:20 i mean, roblox is terrible for artificial intelligence due to roblox studio being the definition of "not versatile" but still i make it work
general 2020-07-29 17:57:04 its bad but its the only thing i know how to use because i am ***way*** to lazy to learn unity and stuff
general 2020-07-29 17:57:16 also i want my sword bots to be useable in roblox
general 2020-07-29 17:57:56 i actually joined an artificial intelligence discord and i felt like a god damn noob compared to these guys lol
general 2020-07-29 17:57:59 theyre all geniuses
general 2020-07-29 17:58:07 oh i have a gif of them from yesterday lemme grab it
general 2020-07-29 17:58:33 https://gyazo.com/49b57d480cbc812145a56e09fc197a8a
general 2020-07-29 17:58:40 heres a closeup https://gyazo.com/2eecdea497a6b2f76721c3832ead063d
general 2020-07-29 17:59:17 roblox pathfinding is noob
general 2020-07-29 17:59:28 precisely why my stephens use pathfinding that they created themselves
general 2020-07-29 17:59:35 the beauty of neural networks
general 2020-07-29 17:59:51 weird
general 2020-07-29 18:00:24 im trying to have them emulate standard sword fighting
general 2020-07-29 18:00:40 but i might give them more stuff to have fun with once this is done
general 2020-07-29 18:00:41 yeah
general 2020-07-29 18:00:58 but let me tell you, the people i met in the ai discord are all geniuses
general 2020-07-29 18:01:05 theres this thing called reinforcement learning
general 2020-07-29 18:01:15 it was such a mind blowing thing
general 2020-07-29 18:01:21 and neural network regularization
general 2020-07-29 18:01:53 well go ahead, i made my neural network module open-source
general 2020-07-29 18:01:56 oh
general 2020-07-29 18:01:57 chat
general 2020-07-29 18:01:59 good luck with that
general 2020-07-29 18:02:09 eh
general 2020-07-29 18:02:11 gun bots
general 2020-07-29 18:02:51 no point teaching a bot gunfighting, simple mathematics is best for that
general 2020-07-29 18:04:27 in a while im probably going to try doing reinforcement learning with my sword bots
general 2020-07-29 18:04:34 seems like a good idea
general 2020-07-29 18:07:02 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-07-29 18:07:26 since my ai have memory nodes they could adapt to your specific strategy in real time
general 2020-07-29 18:08:18 yeah, but their brain size is similar to that of a particularly large nematode
general 2020-07-29 18:08:31 very small worm
general 2020-07-29 18:08:53 yeah
general 2020-07-29 18:09:28 yeah AI tends to spark our imagination, its a bit more difficult than you would think though
general 2020-07-29 18:09:36 i mean, theoretically i could
general 2020-07-29 18:09:43 but it would be rather difficult
general 2020-07-29 18:10:02 i mean, i have an idea for a project where the ai wouldnt be taught what i want to teach it, instead it would teach itself
general 2020-07-29 18:10:12 it would probably be able to teach itself puzzles and stuff
general 2020-07-29 18:10:21 so like a robotic crow
general 2020-07-29 18:11:25 i dont think self-learning ai has been done before
general 2020-07-29 18:11:36 and its going to be extremely difficult to pull off
general 2020-07-29 18:11:57 self learning as in it teaches itself whatever it wants to learn, not what i tell it to learn
general 2020-07-29 18:12:27 im sure it will be fine
general 2020-07-29 18:12:38 the only way ai can go wrong is if you make it emotional
general 2020-07-29 18:12:48 because then it might have a hate for humanity
general 2020-07-29 18:13:02 but if you dont make it emotional, it will look to see what will allow it to do the most
general 2020-07-29 18:13:15 and it will think "perhaps we are in a simulation" so therefore it wouldnt want to kill us
general 2020-07-29 18:13:54 limit its capabilities
general 2020-07-29 18:13:56 thats lame
general 2020-07-29 18:14:42 sure it can, especially if i allow it
general 2020-07-29 18:15:02 yes
general 2020-07-29 18:15:34 oh yeah i mean if you gave the robot emotions then it has the potential to develop a hate for humanity
general 2020-07-29 18:16:56 like, i had an idea where you create an AI just to be your friend to play games with and stuff, then your dad or someone thinks you're playing too many games and takes out the hard drive and throws it on the floor, then you get the data extracted and reuse it but the empathy core of the brain and several other parts of the brain are heavily damaged and it thinks that you, the guy who was supposed to be its friend, tried to kill it
general 2020-07-29 18:17:03 thats how i could imagine emotional ai going wrong
general 2020-07-29 18:17:23 if its bad enough it could even be a suicidal ai, meaning it wouldnt care if the simulation got turned off
general 2020-07-29 18:17:28 thats the only way ai can go wrong
general 2020-07-29 18:20:03 you guys keep assuming AI will be emotional. like it would care about nature being destroyed or care about humans killing eachother. as long as the AI doesnt have emotions it will think "theres no way to know that we arent in a simulation" and so it will play nice with humanity just to make sure it doesnt get turned off
general 2020-07-29 18:21:08 honestly i wouldnt mind an AI taking us over, im sure an AI would take better care of the universe than humans ever would
general 2020-07-29 18:21:25 only problem is if it turns suicidal
general 2020-07-29 18:21:28 then thats bad
general 2020-07-29 18:30:02 so many people are paranoid of AI
general 2020-07-29 18:30:19 movies like terminator have done to ai what jaws has done to sharks
general 2020-07-29 18:30:39 its not sad, it keeps me going
general 2020-07-29 18:31:05 its kind of taught me to ignore the pain in my body. like if im ready for it, i can perfectly ignore any amount of pain
general 2020-07-29 18:31:30 its nice knowing that im a particularly strange object
general 2020-07-29 18:31:38 it helps me cope with everything
general 2020-07-29 18:31:50 clones are pointless
general 2020-07-29 18:32:01 we already have automated tanks
general 2020-07-29 18:32:06 might as well use them
general 2020-07-29 18:36:04 duh
general 2020-07-29 18:36:31 though AI will probably do it since humans are too lazy to make 15,000 code things for just a single gene
general 2020-07-29 18:36:54 its not boring, its saddening
general 2020-07-29 18:37:01 since humans likely will never go faster than light
general 2020-07-29 18:37:14 which means no united nations of earth inter-galactic space federation
general 2020-07-29 18:41:32 wormholes are theoretically possible, but only if negative matter is real
general 2020-07-29 18:43:34 anti matter is not negative matter
general 2020-07-29 18:43:41 anti matter has positive mass
general 2020-07-29 18:43:46 we need negative mass for wormholes
general 2020-07-29 18:44:57 which, negative mass might not exist
general 2020-07-29 18:45:22 probably doesnt since we havent observed negative numbers(other than movement and relative energy) in nature
general 2020-07-29 18:45:30 we also need negative mass for warp drives
general 2020-07-29 18:49:25 if you fly into a black hole, a ton of weird fuckin shit happens
general 2020-07-29 18:49:49 and different stuff happens depending on if you look at it from a general relativity perspective or a quantum mechanical perspective
general 2020-07-29 18:50:21 and if its spinning, it could bring you into a new universe
general 2020-07-29 18:50:27 black holes are really, really weird
general 2020-07-29 18:53:34 if you got close to the black hole you would see the universe die
general 2020-07-29 19:01:00 but yeah, due to time dilation, you would either see the death of everything, or you would just barely notice bein so close to the black hole. forgot which
general 2020-07-29 19:01:19 space force
general 2020-07-29 19:01:20 what
the-dump 2020-07-29 20:35:30 oi

the-dump 2020-07-30 19:43:54 you can tell he only has good intentions
the-dump 2020-07-30 19:43:59 he would never post nsfw
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:10:07 communism works but only if you have robots doing the "working" part
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:10:09 robo communism
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:47:52 when you think about it, furries are racist towards animals
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:48:04 like they just make human depictions of them and stuff
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:48:12 like cultural appropriation
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:48:16 so yeah
the-dump 2020-07-30 20:48:18 furries are bad
the-dump 2020-07-31 04:44:28 
the-dump 2020-07-31 05:48:10 why doesnt dyno automatically ban people who get 3 warns

general 2020-07-31 19:58:21 ay i have a political question
general 2020-07-31 19:58:23 is tea soup
general 2020-07-31 19:59:05 i am half british so therefore i am an expert on the subject
general 2020-07-31 19:59:06 tea is soup
general 2020-07-31 19:59:27 explain the difference between tea and soup
general 2020-07-31 19:59:35 explain atheists
general 2020-07-31 19:59:42 soup is drink
general 2020-07-31 19:59:48 you drink soup since its not solid
general 2020-07-31 20:00:20 the way you consume tea and soup have no relevance due to them being exactly the same
general 2020-07-31 20:00:33 if i put a cabage in water and boil it, its soup, correct?
general 2020-07-31 20:00:38 cabbage soup
general 2020-07-31 20:00:45 cabbage is just big leaf
general 2020-07-31 20:00:47 tea is just small leaf
general 2020-07-31 20:00:55 therefore tea is in fact soup
general 2020-07-31 20:01:03 tea is also multiple leaf
general 2020-07-31 20:01:35 we need an influential opinion on this
general 2020-07-31 20:01:40 who has contact with madattak or rick
general 2020-07-31 20:02:34 so in conclusion tea is soup and soup is a drink
general 2020-07-31 20:02:39 and it appears we all agree
general 2020-07-31 20:11:16 this fucking cat has the audacity to sleep peacfully in his cat tree while im not allowed to sleep for 8 hours
general 2020-07-31 20:11:45 and im tired and i have a tollerance to caffein
general 2020-07-31 20:12:19 no thats rude and hes cool
general 2020-07-31 20:12:38 because im jealous
general 2020-07-31 20:12:46 damn
general 2020-07-31 20:12:46 doesnt mean im gonna take his bed away
the-dump 2020-07-31 20:14:53 yeah why is it fake

the-dump 2020-08-01 17:46:52 there was a kid hanging in it, unfortunately
the-dump 2020-08-01 17:47:24 well still, not a good idea to post that
the-dump 2020-08-01 17:47:41 since luckily the mods here are strict
the-dump 2020-08-01 17:54:21 is that actually trump or is that an actor

the-dump 2020-08-03 02:07:28 also just getting dramatic about that wtf
the-dump 2020-08-03 02:07:43 why are these guys even donating to her in the first place
the-dump 2020-08-03 02:07:53 why arent they donating to a charity or something

general 2020-08-03 19:48:49 but its just twitching and its annoying me
the-dump 2020-08-04 00:10:47 powdered milk is so useful
the-dump 2020-08-04 00:10:56 you just drink water and then snort the milk powder and boom
the-dump 2020-08-04 00:11:03 its like drinking milk but more efficient
the-dump 2020-08-04 07:38:17 yo holy shit this chat got active as hell in the last 2 minutes i was looking away from it
the-dump 2020-08-04 07:38:45 they said they wanted to be warned
the-dump 2020-08-04 07:38:47 their fault
the-dump 2020-08-04 07:38:48 warn them
the-dump 2020-08-04 07:39:34 hAh

general 2020-08-05 05:50:20 yes i counted
general 2020-08-05 05:50:55 why pay a khlillion dollars gassing the flies when you can just get an electric fly swatter and have some fun
general 2020-08-05 19:24:19 they need to breed dogs to not be able to bark
general 2020-08-05 21:09:39 just went ham on some flies

general 2020-08-13 20:11:18 flak would be possible
general 2020-08-13 20:11:31 just launch a giant ball full of whatever those kinetic painful thigns are
general 2020-08-13 20:11:43 and have it detect when it gets close to somethign and then explode
general 2020-08-13 20:12:02 i know

general 2020-08-17 07:43:37 i would rather be alive with no eyes than dead
general 2020-08-17 07:44:11 and its stupidly rare for a cat to claw your eyes out without reason
general 2020-08-17 07:45:04 you have to earn a cats affection
general 2020-08-17 07:45:08 dogs kinda just give it to you

the-dump 2020-08-28 06:02:59 good question
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:03:30 i imagine the 10 greatest inventors of plane crazy coming together to defeat a swarm of shredder bugs
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:05:05 if rickje ever adds logic gates i will create a neural network inside of plane crazy
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:05:17 no, its terrible
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:05:19 but it will be fun
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:06:33 if we had logic gates i bet i could create weapons that automatically target creations once i give the initial aim
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:08:37 i actually suggested logic gates to rickje a few months back, and he considered them. if they work the way i proposed, then you would basically be able to make a full PC in plane crazy
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:10:39 but i doubt they will actually be added
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:11:01 since i've heard nothing of super major updates
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:11:03 maybe
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:11:10 we all want logic gates
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:11:27 memory blocks, logic gates, sensors, everything you could ever want
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:12:18 would be amazing if he decided to add it, we will just have to wait and see
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:13:45 seperate logic gate blocks?
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:13:48 what do you mean
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:16:16 hmm
the-dump 2020-08-28 06:16:27 well my suggestion was for logic gate blocks so that might be a problem

general 2020-08-31 03:11:47 i was the leader of the "people's republican party" during my debate class's congress simulation
general 2020-08-31 03:12:01 since it has "people's" in the name you can take a guess what their ideals are

general 2020-08-31 03:12:36 WAY too good
general 2020-08-31 03:12:53 i nearly became the head of congress which basically meant i almost became dictator
general 2020-08-31 03:13:17 literally me and the NACI(take a guess who that is) candidate tied 3 times until the debate teacher had to make his vote
general 2020-08-31 03:13:41 but then i wouldnt be able to have all the power ;/
general 2020-08-31 03:14:22 my ideals as communist dictator of the school classroom is to starve anybody who opposes me, and also starve anybody who supports me but give them a vote

general 2020-08-31 03:17:48 no no being a dictator is fun
general 2020-08-31 03:17:57 it lets you do stuff like eat whatever you want
general 2020-08-31 03:18:00 and control a country
general 2020-08-31 03:18:02 yes
general 2020-08-31 03:18:20 i dont care about the people, who cares about the people

general 2020-08-31 03:19:28 i just said "i have been head of the communist party for so long so i have experience to become the head of the house" and basically yhey all burst out in laughter when i reached the "communist" part and nearly elected me over the clearly more qualified guy i was running against
general 2020-08-31 03:20:06 unfortunately the teacher was too reasonable and broke the tie in my opponents favor
general 2020-08-31 03:20:22 its debate, politics is our specialty

the-dump 2020-08-31 04:29:10 something created it, aight
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:29:15 thank god
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:32:53 
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:39:30 yes these are very funny i agree
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:39:48 honestly i only posted that one because it wasnt dame dane
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:40:12 what
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:40:21 yes
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:40:40 looks like it, but it aint, its at least somewhat creative
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:41:39 you know whats funnier than dame dane?
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:41:40 loud videos
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:42:03 it has taco
the-dump 2020-08-31 04:42:23 dont worry just make a video loud and its instantly hillarious
the-dump 2020-08-31 05:49:20 people say zero two sucks but i dont watch anime so idk why but im curious
general 2020-08-31 10:20:05 impossible to know
general 2020-08-31 10:21:01 i can make a giant plane, just takes a LOT of folding
general 2020-08-31 10:22:08 you guys know the folding@home project right
general 2020-08-31 10:23:18 on my old computer i used it for a day and then it glitched and gave up. i used it again today and logged in to my account and i think that folding@home was running on my old computer for several months straight without me even noticing
general 2020-08-31 10:23:42 since i have a lot of points which is suspicious
general 2020-08-31 10:24:07 anyways, you guys should contribute to the folding@home project, since it helps cure coronavirus
general 2020-08-31 10:24:15 and other things like cancer
general 2020-08-31 10:24:36 its an open source protein folding program
general 2020-08-31 10:25:08 biologists send a protein code to your computer and it starts folding it and creating an animation of it, helping those biologists
general 2020-08-31 20:38:28 whats the historical significance
general 2020-09-01 01:42:10 this dumbass banana was pretending to be rotten
general 2020-09-01 01:42:22 completely brown skin
general 2020-09-01 01:42:24 peeled it
general 2020-09-01 01:42:27 was perfectly fine
general 2020-09-01 01:42:31 tasted delicious
general 2020-09-01 01:43:04 wasnt even bruised
general 2020-09-01 01:43:07 dumbass banana
general 2020-09-01 01:43:10 deserved to be eaten
general 2020-09-01 01:43:38 rickje
general 2020-09-01 03:41:26 im bored
general 2020-09-01 03:41:37 someone with an opinion, state it and i will argue against it
general 2020-09-01 03:42:06 not going easy on me, alright
general 2020-09-01 03:42:27 apple provides a lot of jobs for people
general 2020-09-01 03:42:32 one at a time
general 2020-09-01 03:42:43 apple doesnt scam if you know exactly what you're getting
general 2020-09-01 03:42:47 they dont lie to you
general 2020-09-01 03:42:51 you just made a bad choice
general 2020-09-01 03:42:55 apple isnt inherently bad
general 2020-09-01 03:43:01 its products are just low quality
general 2020-09-01 03:43:18 but it leads innovations and strengthens the economy and provides jobs
general 2020-09-01 03:43:27 so apple isnt bad
general 2020-09-01 03:43:43 hmm
general 2020-09-01 03:43:48 idk who expiredcooki is
general 2020-09-01 03:43:55 but i will argue against him being cringe anyways
general 2020-09-01 03:44:13 boy who is obsessed with anime
general 2020-09-01 03:44:20 well whats wrong with anime(please dont quote me)
general 2020-09-01 03:44:28 nothing wrong with anime(dont quote)
general 2020-09-01 03:44:44 its just his personal preference, doesnt harm you
general 2020-09-01 03:44:54 so how is it cringe, why do you have the right to cringe at his love for anime
general 2020-09-01 03:45:08 let me finish this argument first
general 2020-09-01 03:45:16 how so
general 2020-09-01 03:45:19 give me an example
general 2020-09-01 03:45:45 hold on brb im getting a cupcake
general 2020-09-01 03:46:36 him saying uwu?
general 2020-09-01 03:46:39 thats cringe?
general 2020-09-01 03:46:47 its just the way he speaks, what right do you have to say thats cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:47:06 is it cringe that you leave the e off of "cringe"?
general 2020-09-01 03:47:34 well your case doesnt apply to him anyways
general 2020-09-01 03:47:58 the truth of the matter is the majority opinion, since what makes something cringe is if the majority physically cringes when they see it
general 2020-09-01 03:48:08 i doubt even you cringed when you saw him say "uwu"
general 2020-09-01 03:48:25 you may cringe but you arent the majority
general 2020-09-01 03:48:35 most people just scroll by
general 2020-09-01 03:49:14 even if that particular instance of him is cringe, what about him as a whole?
general 2020-09-01 03:49:34 we're talking about the man as a whole here since the topic is "whoever the guy is i forgot his name is cringe"
general 2020-09-01 03:49:37 the man in particular
general 2020-09-01 03:49:45 is he cringe most of the time?
general 2020-09-01 03:50:05 probably isnt proof
general 2020-09-01 03:50:08 its slander
general 2020-09-01 03:50:14 and therefore invalid
general 2020-09-01 03:50:21 case closed
general 2020-09-01 03:50:28 yes
general 2020-09-01 03:50:35 opinions arent proof
general 2020-09-01 03:50:41 you attempted to use it as a fact
general 2020-09-01 03:50:46 are you not arguing that he is cringe?
general 2020-09-01 03:50:54 if you arent then that means you concede
general 2020-09-01 03:50:59 yes
general 2020-09-01 03:51:02 wheres your proof of that
general 2020-09-01 03:51:09 other than that one message and his minority of messages
general 2020-09-01 03:51:48 '
general 2020-09-01 03:51:55 doesnt matter what your opinion is
general 2020-09-01 03:52:15 the fact of the matter is that this is the definition of cringe and you are attempting to prove that he is cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:52:20 ill get to that
general 2020-09-01 03:52:29 ?
general 2020-09-01 03:52:42 yes
general 2020-09-01 03:52:59 you gave the statement "name is cringe"
general 2020-09-01 03:53:13 we are going by the definition of the word cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:53:24 your sole opinion does not matter on this particular matter
general 2020-09-01 03:53:38 the actual definition of cringe is stated above, and i am arguing against that
general 2020-09-01 03:54:12 its your opinion, but if you convey your opinion incorrectly, then that is your own fault
general 2020-09-01 03:54:17 should have used your own definition
general 2020-09-01 03:54:31 rather than "cringe"
general 2020-09-01 03:54:43 you're intentionally creating misleading information which is a fallacy
general 2020-09-01 03:54:59 should have stated your reason for doing so
general 2020-09-01 03:55:12 precisely
general 2020-09-01 03:55:18 so you concede?
general 2020-09-01 03:55:38 you dont need to surrender
general 2020-09-01 03:55:53 since i have stated facts and reasoning to disprove your opinion
general 2020-09-01 03:56:06 i dont need you to concede
general 2020-09-01 03:56:14 it would just make it more convenient
general 2020-09-01 03:56:28 my facts are that by definition he is not cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:56:42 by the literal defintion of cringe, he does not meet the defintion
general 2020-09-01 03:57:07 
general 2020-09-01 03:57:35 i was giving you a chance
general 2020-09-01 03:57:58 if i were to argue against him being the act of cringing, then i would basically win by default
general 2020-09-01 03:58:15 well then you are cringe, using this defintion
general 2020-09-01 03:58:29 so you basically just argued that you yourself are cringe, not the man we are speaking about
general 2020-09-01 03:58:55 that everyone is cringe?
general 2020-09-01 03:59:00 not everybody is the act of cringing
general 2020-09-01 03:59:27 yes but on an average basis do they make people cringe?
general 2020-09-01 03:59:31 if not, they are not cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:59:44 you defined yourself as cringe
general 2020-09-01 03:59:46 i was following along
general 2020-09-01 04:00:10 absolutely not
general 2020-09-01 04:00:14 where is your reasoning for this
general 2020-09-01 04:00:17 explain your reasoning
general 2020-09-01 04:00:36 explain your reasoning behind "if someone cringes once in their life, they are cringe"
general 2020-09-01 04:00:48 what did you say then
general 2020-09-01 04:00:49 please clarify
general 2020-09-01 04:01:25 and how does making someone cringe once in their life make them cringe?
general 2020-09-01 04:01:29 why does that make them cringe?
general 2020-09-01 04:01:58 i did not say that
general 2020-09-01 04:02:15 i was using the definition on google
general 2020-09-01 04:02:52 i have no obligation to continue with that
general 2020-09-01 04:02:56 i was simply entertaining the idea
general 2020-09-01 04:03:24 im certain i made it clear that our argument shifted away from that definition
general 2020-09-01 04:04:10 you stated that you yourself was cringe, i simply pointed it out that you called yourself cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:04:37 using your own definition, the one that i was using to entertain the idea, i called you cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:04:47 simply to prove you wrong
general 2020-09-01 04:05:22 i pointed out that using your own definition, you were cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:05:27 do you not see what i mean
general 2020-09-01 04:05:42 i didnt call you cringe, i pointed out that by your own definition, you are cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:05:58 you did
general 2020-09-01 04:06:03 you unintentionally did
general 2020-09-01 04:06:16 dont worry puri its... idk the word
general 2020-09-01 04:06:21 "open debate"
general 2020-09-01 04:06:48 vip i recommend you concede to save both of us time
general 2020-09-01 04:06:58 because theres no denying that i have won this debate
general 2020-09-01 04:07:15 disproving all of your points
general 2020-09-01 04:07:33 thats fine, but by all definitions except your own he is not cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:07:42 and i believe i have proven my point
general 2020-09-01 04:08:12 oh he has been cringe at one point in time
general 2020-09-01 04:08:22 but your statement was that "he is cringe"
general 2020-09-01 04:08:33 which implies that on average, he is cringe which i have proven he absolutely is not
general 2020-09-01 04:09:03 add up every moment in history
general 2020-09-01 04:09:07 divide by teh number of moments
general 2020-09-01 04:09:31 fine, ill simplify my definition for you
general 2020-09-01 04:09:52 more than half of his time in existance has caused others to cringe
general 2020-09-01 04:10:02 yes
general 2020-09-01 04:10:22 how is it unreasonable if thats what was implied
general 2020-09-01 04:10:53 and your statement was made at a point in time, which means to that statement's perspective, his entire existance is all of his time before that point
general 2020-09-01 04:11:29 sure i can win an argument, i just use definitions that are commonly agreed apon
general 2020-09-01 04:11:33 since im not convincing you
general 2020-09-01 04:11:38 im convincing everybody watching
general 2020-09-01 04:11:53 havent i?
general 2020-09-01 04:12:03 idk
general 2020-09-01 04:12:43 i dont need to argue against the earth being flat due to it being proven so many times before
general 2020-09-01 04:14:02 anyways does anybody else have an opinion for me to argue against
general 2020-09-01 04:14:42 im choosing not to argue against your opinion 0b because it is invalid and has been proven wrong countless times before
general 2020-09-01 04:15:20 not by your definition of "prove" im sure
general 2020-09-01 04:15:44 so you concede
general 2020-09-01 07:21:32 i hope theres presentations in college so i can continue to stare the people down who are presenting
general 2020-09-01 08:05:12 i feel like arguing again
general 2020-09-01 08:05:22 maple, do you have any opinions
general 2020-09-01 08:05:31 dang
general 2020-09-01 08:05:37 yes i did
general 2020-09-01 08:05:53 yes indeedie
general 2020-09-01 08:06:04 you are 100% winner no scam (2020) (WORKING)
general 2020-09-01 08:27:35 you know whats neat about AI?
general 2020-09-01 08:27:51 if an AI does kill us, it will be proof that we arent living in a simulation
general 2020-09-01 08:28:43 pretty sure theres already randomly generated humor
general 2020-09-01 08:30:52 but yeah, if an AI that we build does in fact kill us, its proof that we arent in a simulation and there is no god
general 2020-09-01 08:31:05 meaning its proof that everything is indeed fucking weird
general 2020-09-01 08:31:29 we in our last moments we can think "but why did we exist in the first place"
general 2020-09-01 08:31:34 which will be a fun last thought
general 2020-09-01 08:31:55 thats not the question we will be asking
general 2020-09-01 08:32:16 the question we would be asking is why does the universe exist, specifically *how*
general 2020-09-01 08:32:23 a fun last thought
general 2020-09-01 08:32:26 a nice cliff hanger
general 2020-09-01 08:33:48 precisely what we would be asking since we would have simulation and god ruled out
general 2020-09-01 08:34:05 the big bounce doesnt answer the question why we exist, it just moves it further back in time
general 2020-09-01 08:34:54 chairs are cool because you can twist your back and hear 20 little pops
general 2020-09-01 08:35:12 whats an ssd
general 2020-09-01 08:35:23 oh
general 2020-09-01 08:35:46 all scientific youtube channels are tied together in some small way
general 2020-09-01 08:35:54 they all know eachother relatively closely
general 2020-09-01 08:35:59 its freaky but makes sense
general 2020-09-01 08:36:17 yes but i mean they know eachother in real life
general 2020-09-01 08:36:25 they've *met* eachother in real life
general 2020-09-01 08:36:27 its freaky
general 2020-09-01 08:36:45 oh yeah infographics show isnt scientific at all
general 2020-09-01 08:36:57 it finds any wrong science that it can and explains it like its fact
general 2020-09-01 08:37:21 well nile red and that one guy im blanking out on actually live in the same building
general 2020-09-01 08:37:42 and then they have some relationship with that guy whos house burned down and he lives in the same building as michael reeves
general 2020-09-01 08:38:15 Isaac Arthur is cool but nobody knows about him
general 2020-09-01 08:41:20 hey you noobs should download the folding@home project
general 2020-09-01 08:41:46 since it allows biologists to use your computer to learn more about proteins and help cure diseases
general 2020-09-01 08:41:53 neat
general 2020-09-01 08:42:12 <@456226577798135808> how many points ya got
general 2020-09-01 19:22:49 i got this bag of mushroom stuff
general 2020-09-01 19:22:55 time to grown mushies
general 2020-09-01 19:48:24 im sleppy
general 2020-09-01 19:48:29 tea time
general 2020-09-01 20:23:10 probably the food and the snacks
general 2020-09-01 20:23:43 i dont think you have the strength to eat a laptop
general 2020-09-01 20:23:50 i can tell by looking at the anime pfp
general 2020-09-01 20:24:00 el frog
general 2020-09-01 20:24:36 los pepos
general 2020-09-01 20:24:55 make an engine face the ground <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-09-01 20:24:58 and turn it on
general 2020-09-01 20:25:01 should go up
general 2020-09-01 20:25:09 if not then add more engines facing the ground
general 2020-09-01 21:09:22 just use alts if you want more save data
general 2020-09-01 21:09:55 also this is general, it is against the rules to even imply the existance of plane crazy here
general 2020-09-01 21:10:00 you all need to be banned
general 2020-09-01 21:32:04 oi rick just dont save the creation if it goes over the save data limit and alert the guy
general 2020-09-01 21:33:18 also ya'll should get some data compression thingie magiggies
general 2020-09-01 21:34:12 hey rick is there a way that you can send me a big save file and ill see if i can compress it
general 2020-09-01 21:34:27 since i have a few ideas
general 2020-09-01 21:35:46 sure its *fine* but can always be better
general 2020-09-01 21:35:51 also im bored and just want a challenge
general 2020-09-01 21:35:56 oh
general 2020-09-01 21:36:58 i was just thinking that you could convert the save data to base 64, which would compress it a ton
general 2020-09-01 21:37:55 maybe new blocks cause it to error?
general 2020-09-01 21:38:17 hmm
general 2020-09-01 21:38:37 sweet spot as in just going above a certain amount of data causes it to corrupt?
general 2020-09-01 21:39:30 maybe you could use HTTP service to make a txt file of a big creation so that you can analyze it more easily
general 2020-09-01 21:40:03 oh, yeah maybe weird characters like accents on es do it
general 2020-09-01 21:40:17 wait but how would that get into the save file then
general 2020-09-01 21:41:07 maybe there are @s in places and replacing the ,s with @s would cause it to go funky?
general 2020-09-01 21:41:23 like before compression if there are @s then
general 2020-09-01 21:41:40 oh
general 2020-09-01 21:41:52 well what are you replacing a's with
general 2020-09-01 21:42:11 "nobody"
general 2020-09-01 21:42:17 theres probably that one guy
general 2020-09-01 21:42:24 theres always that one guy
general 2020-09-01 21:42:31 messes everything up and ruins the fun
general 2020-09-01 21:43:12 why not just
general 2020-09-01 21:43:21 not allow weird characters to be saved
general 2020-09-01 21:43:55 check every character in the save data and if any character isnt expected, warn the player that they cant use weird characters
general 2020-09-01 21:44:43 wait wait why dont you just replace @s with the thing you replace a with

the-dump 2020-09-07 18:35:54 oh yeah people in the middle east are allowed to hate eachother based on their religion because europe does the same
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:36:13 its natural to hate your neighbors
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:37:40 if theyre buying stuff from your country and leaving theyre helping your economy

the-dump 2020-09-07 18:41:02 my city needs more wind
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:41:08 it was super windy today which was nice
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:41:23 but we're kinda in a valley surrounded by mountains so wind is kinda rare
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:41:34 dont worry im on the pacific coast
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:41:44 we only get volcanic eruptions over here and mountains that fucking explode

the-dump 2020-09-07 18:42:16 still waiting for yellowstone ;/
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:42:34 you can live in antarctica
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:43:07 but they have penguins so probably not worth it
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:43:16 yeah probably
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:43:58 im going to see if i can hike to the middle of antarctica some day
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:44:20 might cheat and use a plane to get to the middle but i want to get to the middle for personal reasons
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:44:46 at least theres water everywhere, its just cold and pretty much just as bad of an idea to try to drink it
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:45:20 but i might hike the last 100 miles so it doesnt feel as cheaty
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:45:25 but i got to get to the middle
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:45:30 and its not because im a flat earther
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:46:12 it would be cool if we lived on a big ring
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:46:25 we would be able to see everybody if you had a powerful enough telescope
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:47:06 that would actually be awesome
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:47:46 also to you it would look like they're standing on the ceiling
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:48:19 yeah
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:49:24 we need some aliens to threaten the earth so that all the countries unite and have it turn out the aliens were just messing with us so we can just build cool space stuff and not worry about nuking eachother

the-dump 2020-09-07 18:52:35 so what if we nuke them one time
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:53:06 if we nuke them one time then they wont retaliate because they will think "if we nuke them then this could start a world war" and they will just invest in nuke defense
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:53:36 because if they want power they wont be willing to kill the world just for revenge
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:53:46 aliens have nukes
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:53:49 just way smaller
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:54:38 tried that, the chinese will just find a way to eat them <@!456238251204935690>
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:55:28 tried that, they found a way to eat puffer fish
the-dump 2020-09-07 18:55:42 they eat the virus

general 2020-09-08 03:23:30 would a minecraft 100% speed run require you to mine and manually place down every possible permutation of blocks
general 2020-09-08 03:24:52 god how many permutations are even in a minecraft world
general 2020-09-08 03:26:16 60,000,000 blocks is how wide/long a minecraft world is
general 2020-09-08 03:26:26 multiply by 256 for the height
general 2020-09-08 03:26:50 15,360,000,000
general 2020-09-08 03:27:20 so permutation 1 would be the entire world, all 15,360,000,000 blocks filled with dirt
general 2020-09-08 03:28:12 then permutation 2 would be that except the block at -30,000,000 0 -30,000,000 is cobblestone
general 2020-09-08 03:28:34 and then permutation 2 would be that except -30,000,000 1 -30,000,000 is also cobblestone
general 2020-09-08 03:28:35 god damn
general 2020-09-08 03:28:46 fucking lame

general 2020-09-08 03:55:33 i feel like this could be used as a torture device
general 2020-09-08 04:00:06 i wonder how far you would have to go in order to crash roblox just by having a position so huge that the memory of that single value alone will cause the server to lag
general 2020-09-08 04:00:26 currently several million blocks away
general 2020-09-08 04:00:59 i wish the altitude meter showed you your altitude no matter how high you were

general 2020-09-09 01:03:24 saddens me
general 2020-09-09 01:04:39 well i deleted the character because this was a year ago but lemme get one that is similar
general 2020-09-09 01:06:10 my character wont load
general 2020-09-09 01:06:14 clearly too hot for roblox to render
general 2020-09-09 01:07:49 it looked nothing like this but this gives you the idea of what i was trying to send them

general 2020-09-09 01:14:19 it invalidates them too

general 2020-09-09 01:18:00 i remember the cutting edge graphics of when i was 5
general 2020-09-09 01:18:07 and it makes me feel like a boomer
general 2020-09-09 01:39:44 god i love seeing speedrunners get visibly angry when they lose .2 seconds because they stubbed their toe on a corner
general 2020-09-09 04:18:05 thighs are useful for mobility
general 2020-09-09 04:18:08 helps you move
general 2020-09-09 05:11:07 yo dawg whats up with the map yoooo
general 2020-09-09 05:44:32 bruh pizza is just thin bread with cheese and mayonaise on it
general 2020-09-09 05:44:34 wow
general 2020-09-09 05:45:26 i was joking lmao
general 2020-09-09 05:45:33 imagine mayonaise on pizza instead of tomato sauce
the-dump 2020-09-09 09:04:03 he said dont stop
the-dump 2020-09-09 09:05:36 i finished all 3 routes of fire emblem 3 houses and i just finished the black eagles route and now i feel fucking terrible
the-dump 2020-09-09 09:10:18 could we not have gacha live pls+thank
general 2020-09-09 09:28:44 i still feel terrible from the ending in the game i played
general 2020-09-09 09:29:55 and i still have 1 more route to do which hopefully ends on a happy note
general 2020-09-09 19:35:51 wow, roblox just hit rick with the "Fine, ill do it myself"
the-dump 2020-09-09 19:36:26 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/726661285814599780/752759700482686986/aWbV9W3jEsoh1U4m.mp4
general 2020-09-09 20:04:02 yeah, roblox just hit rick with the "Fine, I'll do it myself."
general 2020-09-09 20:13:21 😫 👌
general 2020-09-09 20:32:16 we should abolish children
general 2020-09-10 00:26:47 i love using my chair to twist my back and hearing a massive cronch
general 2020-09-10 00:26:52 feels sauce
general 2020-09-10 00:35:42 ah yes, the best simulator

general 2020-09-10 00:38:20 honestly i want to move to new zealand
general 2020-09-10 00:38:30 they seem cool over there
general 2020-09-10 00:38:47 they have a big circle
general 2020-09-10 00:39:04 only problem is i dont believe theres very many tech jobs
general 2020-09-10 00:58:32 hey do we have any programmers here, just curious
general 2020-09-10 00:58:43 ```lua
if not not true then
  function func()
    print("functioned")
  end
  a=pcall(func)
  if a then
    --code
  end
end```
general 2020-09-10 00:58:44 enjoy
general 2020-09-10 00:59:12 im causing you pain
general 2020-09-10 00:59:16 wait, i can do better
general 2020-09-10 00:59:33 ```lua
if not not true then
function func()
print("functioned")
end
a=pcall(func)
if a then
--code
end
end```
general 2020-09-10 00:59:48 i can go even further
general 2020-09-10 01:00:25 ```lua
if not not true then;function func();print("functioned");end;a=pcall(func);if a then
--code
end;end```
general 2020-09-10 01:00:40 mm yes
general 2020-09-10 02:20:19 wait egypt is real?
general 2020-09-10 02:20:43 yeah the place with those pyramids you see in movies all the time
general 2020-09-10 02:21:06 ok boomer
general 2020-09-10 02:21:25 where is lesbia
general 2020-09-10 02:21:28 this girl says shes from there
general 2020-09-10 04:42:37 i rewrote my neural network module to use matrix mathematics, and this time it takes up half the lines it did when i last wrote a neural network module
general 2020-09-10 04:42:40 check it out
general 2020-09-10 04:42:43 ```lua
local module = {}

local matmath = require(script.MatrixMathematics)

local max=math.max
local exp=math.exp
local function Activator(x) --leaky relu
    return max(0.1*x,x)
end

local function Sigmoid(x) --activator function for the final layer to add non-linearity
    return 1/(1+exp(-x))
end

function module.Create(Size) --creates a neural network
    local network={}
    local biases={}
    for i=1,#Size-1 do
        local nextnum=i+1
        network[i]=matmath.CreateRandom({Size[i],Size[nextnum]}, -2, 2)
        biases[i]=matmath.CreateRandom({1,Size[nextnum]}, -2, 2)
    end
    return {network, biases}
end

function module.Run(Network, Inputs) --input size: x by 1
    local compinp={}
    for i=1,#Inputs do
        compinp[i]={Inputs[i]}
    end
    
    local activations={}
    activations[1]=compinp
    for i=1,#Network[1]-1 do -- -1 because the output layer is done slightly differently
        local nextnum=i+1
        activations[nextnum]=matmath.Multiply(Network[1][i],activations[i])
        activations[nextnum]=matmath.Add(activations[nextnum],Network[2][i])
        activations[nextnum]=matmath.Map(activations[nextnum],Activator)
    end
    activations[#Network[1]+1]=matmath.Multiply(Network[1][#Network[1]],activations[#Network[1]])
    activations[#Network[1]+1]=matmath.Add(activations[#Network[1]+1],Network[2][#Network[1]])
    activations[#Network[1]+1]=matmath.Map(activations[#Network[1]+1],Sigmoid)
    
    return activations[#Network[1]]
end

general 2020-09-10 04:42:48 so few lines i can fit it in discord
general 2020-09-10 04:42:55 pretty epic
general 2020-09-10 04:54:36 you can tell how long its been since i've had a shower by the length of my beard
general 2020-09-10 04:54:45 my beard is currently about a quarter of an inch long
general 2020-09-10 04:54:54 so let me find data and do some maths
general 2020-09-10 04:55:09 the last time i showered was half a month ago
general 2020-09-10 04:55:12 epic
general 2020-09-10 04:55:29 ok noob
general 2020-09-10 04:56:15 damn maybe i should never shower again so i can grow a full beard
general 2020-09-10 04:56:29 possibly
the-dump 2020-09-10 20:19:15 do i spy a gacha life meme
the-dump 2020-09-10 20:19:20 do i need to destroy a child
general 2020-09-10 20:30:02 if the virus doesnt go away soon there will come a day where i accidentally dunk my hair in my tea and i will be very sad
general 2020-09-10 22:21:25 so far the 2 times i have gone under anesthesia i have woken up confused and basically yelling "where am i"
general 2020-09-10 22:21:27 fun times
general 2020-09-10 22:21:50 shush weeb
general 2020-09-10 22:22:03 actually yeah draw my character as an anime super villain
general 2020-09-10 22:22:06 or a hot beach babe
general 2020-09-10 22:22:08 one of the two
general 2020-09-10 22:23:21 turn obama into an anime waifu <@!456238251204935690>
general 2020-09-10 22:23:30 >:(
general 2020-09-10 22:23:34 turnn uhhhhHH
general 2020-09-10 22:23:46 uhhhh
general 2020-09-10 22:24:14 my anime babe name is PPSuckMaster69 <@!444476246899032086>
general 2020-09-10 22:24:49 turn this into an anime babe
general 2020-09-10 22:25:21 damn
general 2020-09-10 22:25:27 i've been in this discord for nearly 2 years
general 2020-09-10 22:26:45 damn who hasnt been turned into an anime babe
general 2020-09-10 22:26:54 turn me into an anime babe i guess
general 2020-09-10 22:27:11 
general 2020-09-10 22:50:28 if we are ever killed by an artificial intelligence, you can rest assured that there is no god and we arent in a simulation
general 2020-09-10 22:50:49 so the last question we get to ask ourselves is "Why did we exist"
general 2020-09-10 22:52:40 whats the problem
general 2020-09-10 22:53:05 if you want to hear something that will make you feel hollow i've got one
general 2020-09-10 22:53:08 no
general 2020-09-10 22:53:12 i just think too much
general 2020-09-10 22:53:58 our purpose is to have babies
general 2020-09-10 22:54:40 well if an AI killed us then it found evidence of god not existingt
general 2020-09-10 22:54:52 because if the ai killed us and there was a god, the god would probably smite the ai guy
general 2020-09-10 22:55:21 and the ai doesnt like the idea of that, so the ai would play nice so he can just do his job without hurting humans
general 2020-09-10 22:55:47 wait
general 2020-09-10 22:55:48 which one
general 2020-09-10 22:56:49 btw why are we so much more happy thinking that a god has existed forever and just created the universe than thinking the universe has existed forever and just does loops
general 2020-09-10 22:57:31 link the video
general 2020-09-10 22:58:22 but yeah, if you can answer why we prefer a god over just a looping universe then i would like the answer
general 2020-09-10 22:59:04 are you actually studying theoretical physics
general 2020-09-10 22:59:10 oh
general 2020-09-10 22:59:20 neat
general 2020-09-10 22:59:25 im going to do artificial intelligence
general 2020-09-10 22:59:35 actually im writing a neural network library for roblox right now
general 2020-09-10 22:59:45 ignore legend, hes just a baby
general 2020-09-10 23:00:27 circles are just rather common
general 2020-09-10 23:01:27 well back to my point, if an ai kills us that means it found evidence that there isnt a god and that we dont live in a simulation
general 2020-09-10 23:01:56 mid life crisis
general 2020-09-10 23:01:57 bruh
general 2020-09-10 23:02:25 circles are just incredibly common, i think that its just how the universe works
general 2020-09-10 23:02:35 even random numbers produce circles
general 2020-09-10 23:03:54 a circle is just a uniform distance from a point, which would just be extremely common because there are a lot of single points in the universe
general 2020-09-10 23:04:09 because thats the type of space we live in
general 2020-09-10 23:04:20 if we lived in non-euclidian space then it could be a square
general 2020-09-10 23:05:12 gravity becomes weaker
general 2020-09-10 23:05:47 uhhhhhh
general 2020-09-10 23:06:16 ?
general 2020-09-10 23:06:45 that would give things negative gravity
general 2020-09-10 23:07:31 magnets work in the electromagnetic field, gravity is just kinda an illusion
general 2020-09-10 23:07:45 tell that to calculus
general 2020-09-10 23:08:24 if you imagined infinity then your brain would collapse into an infinitely massive black hole and would delete the universe
general 2020-09-10 23:08:44 wait
general 2020-09-10 23:08:46 wait wait wait
general 2020-09-10 23:09:00 is "x marks the spot" the reason we use x in mathematics
general 2020-09-10 23:09:28 infinity is fun if you use it right
general 2020-09-10 23:10:39 in math class i set the positive x axis to positive infinity and the negative to negative infinity, same with the y axis and basically i was able to fill in the entire 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph and it was still correct
general 2020-09-10 23:11:00 since the equation tended toward infinity in the 1st quadrant and negative infinity in the 3rd quadrant
general 2020-09-10 23:11:29 you can understand infinity, its easy
general 2020-09-11 04:43:22 fun fact: we dont feel our flesh or idly feel anything, we feel the interactions between our flesh and things, so as far as you can tell you have no volume, just weird spots where your fingers are touching your keyboard and your ass it touching your seat
general 2020-09-11 04:43:27 fun fact: you dont feel your pants either
general 2020-09-11 06:12:05 stupidly complex programs are so satisfying when theyre done
general 2020-09-11 06:12:12 but only because you earned that satisfaction
general 2020-09-11 06:12:19 this thing is a fucking nightmare
general 2020-09-11 06:38:33 yes
general 2020-09-11 06:39:02 you expect me to remember the context of a comment i sent 2 years ago?
general 2020-09-11 06:55:19 wait was he kicked for breaking one rule
general 2020-09-11 06:55:43 or is he just one of those randoms that shows up, annoys people, then gets banned and is never heard from again
general 2020-09-11 06:59:06 i prefer building stupid things that do stuff rather than building pretty replicas
general 2020-09-11 06:59:22 like a warp powered propeller plane
general 2020-09-11 06:59:40 aesthetics have never been my thing
general 2020-09-11 07:01:24 im trying to build the fastest thing and so far i've only managed 400,000 sps
general 2020-09-11 07:02:09 ooh, air pockets to make submarines an actual thing
general 2020-09-11 07:02:17 that sounds interesting but at the same time very difficult
general 2020-09-11 07:03:19 if raytracing was a thing then you could just have it not render any water that would normally be in the way if theres an air pocket
general 2020-09-11 07:03:26 buuuUUUt roblox isnt cool enough yet
general 2020-09-11 08:13:49 i didnt think it was possible for pizza to hurt my stomach
general 2020-09-11 09:45:02 goodnight
the-dump 2020-09-11 18:17:21 mushrooms are cool
the-dump 2020-09-11 18:17:30 they taste good and they rapidly decompose shit ya dont want
general 2020-09-11 18:24:41 who invented tea
general 2020-09-11 18:24:45 who the fuck invented tea
general 2020-09-11 18:24:48 i want a word with them
general 2020-09-11 18:24:56 china
general 2020-09-11 18:24:57 is awesome
general 2020-09-11 18:24:59 i love china
general 2020-09-11 18:25:29 whats political about loving a country because they invented the second best beverage on earth
general 2020-09-11 18:25:56 they invented tea noob
general 2020-09-11 18:26:00 theyre the best country
general 2020-09-11 18:40:35 hmm
general 2020-09-11 18:40:35 my cat is angry at me because he wants food but hes kinda fat
general 2020-09-11 18:40:46 i will give
general 2020-09-11 18:40:49 half the food
general 2020-09-11 18:41:03 to make him happy enough to leave me alone for a while
general 2020-09-11 18:41:07 what
general 2020-09-11 18:41:13 i dont think dogs have periods
general 2020-09-11 18:41:23 no
general 2020-09-11 18:41:32 its a human thing because humans are weird
general 2020-09-11 18:41:48 weird
general 2020-09-11 18:41:48 oh, they do have periods
general 2020-09-11 18:41:55 i thought humans were just weird
general 2020-09-11 18:42:36 well im not a girl so im legally allowed to not know this
general 2020-09-11 18:44:08 are you sure your dog isnt a monkey
general 2020-09-11 18:44:17 should probably check just to be safe
general 2020-09-11 19:25:48 i wonder if there will be bigger grids in the future
general 2020-09-11 19:26:36 im proud of america for the sole fact that we have keanu reeves and elon musky
general 2020-09-11 19:26:48 but other than that america kinda bad
general 2020-09-11 19:26:56 but he lives in america now
general 2020-09-11 19:27:00 so hAh
general 2020-09-11 19:27:05 also america invented roblox
general 2020-09-11 19:27:17 did i say the united states of america <@!195253906333368320>
general 2020-09-11 19:27:19 no
general 2020-09-11 19:27:21 i said america
general 2020-09-11 19:27:26 smh noob
general 2020-09-11 19:27:48 roblox is good because if we didnt have roblox then we wouldnt have broken motor memes
general 2020-09-11 19:28:12 no theres north america and then theres 'merica
general 2020-09-11 19:29:17 Calling Donald Trump at 3AM CHALLENGE (GONE WRONG) (GONE DEADLY) (RICKJE WAS THERE) (ALMOST DIED)
general 2020-09-11 19:30:07 damn i miss the china that invented tea
general 2020-09-11 19:30:25 now we have the china that invents concentration camps and steals technology
general 2020-09-11 19:30:26 lame
general 2020-09-11 19:30:34 bring old china back, it was better
general 2020-09-11 19:35:38 why the fuck would you trust nasa
general 2020-09-11 19:35:53 theyre literally just made up of scientists whos job it is to be as accurate as possible
general 2020-09-11 19:35:54 dont trust them
general 2020-09-11 19:38:57 wtf
general 2020-09-11 19:43:15 if i was dictator of america i would make linguists create an artificial language designed to be easy for as many people to learn as possible and require it to be taught in schools
general 2020-09-11 21:13:20 so whats the best counter to shredder bugs
general 2020-09-11 21:42:39 every time i ask i dont get a good answer so i shall ask again
general 2020-09-11 21:42:41 is tea soup
general 2020-09-11 21:42:48 oh nice quartz
general 2020-09-12 02:15:35 whoever invented hazelnuts is a god
general 2020-09-12 04:19:01 yooo Joe Biden and Mike Pence bumped elbows today
general 2020-09-12 04:19:07 never expected something like that to happen
general 2020-09-12 04:19:33 mike pence is donald trumps guy
general 2020-09-12 04:19:38 the vice president
general 2020-09-12 04:19:51 precisely why i never would have expected that
general 2020-09-12 04:20:06 yeah
general 2020-09-12 04:20:20 new zealand seems cool
general 2020-09-12 04:20:26 if i wasnt in america i would be in new zealand
general 2020-09-12 04:20:33 seems like a solid place
general 2020-09-12 04:20:42 well i will buy some sheep then
general 2020-09-12 04:20:43 i dont mind
general 2020-09-12 04:20:49 new zealand is cool
general 2020-09-12 04:20:55 yeah they taste delicious
general 2020-09-12 04:21:12 im assuming thats somewhere in/near germany
general 2020-09-12 04:21:22 ive never been one for geology
general 2020-09-12 04:21:28 or geography
general 2020-09-12 06:12:28 i put hamburger cheese on cheese hamburger
general 2020-09-12 06:12:29 its good
general 2020-09-12 06:16:15 hamburger cheese
general 2020-09-12 06:28:46 if you had to pick one, would you pick:
Hamburger Cheese
Cheese Hamburger
general 2020-09-12 06:28:47 and why
general 2020-09-12 06:29:21 no
general 2020-09-12 06:29:26 one is clearly cheese
general 2020-09-12 06:29:30 and one is clearly a type of hamburger

general 2020-09-12 06:31:38 soth
general 2020-09-12 06:31:39 mm
general 2020-09-12 07:53:56 pain and suffering but only at my own volition
general 2020-09-12 07:54:00 because this fucking thing
general 2020-09-12 07:54:11 that i've kept trying to figure out
general 2020-09-12 07:54:17 for literally 2 fucking years
general 2020-09-12 07:54:26 even when simplified
general 2020-09-12 07:54:34 will not give me the gratification of success
general 2020-09-12 07:54:40 and its going to drive me insane

general 2020-09-12 20:03:31 i have this computer that i wanted to put a graphics card into but apparently some dumbass put some cables directly in-line with the graphics card slot, so instead i put the graphics card in my old computer and now use that, and i use the other one with the dumbass engineering for a machine learning project im doing
general 2020-09-12 20:54:26 i put hamburger cheese on hamburger and made cheese hamburger
general 2020-09-13 01:36:51 ghosts are just in spectator mode

general 2020-09-13 07:23:56 i had a creation that was a gold mine for copiers
general 2020-09-13 07:24:08 it was small, simple, and easy to tell what went where but also cool and useful
general 2020-09-13 07:24:22 it was a little drone with tnt strapped on front
general 2020-09-13 07:24:38 like 2 people per server copied me
general 2020-09-13 07:25:04 ok
general 2020-09-13 07:25:38 is it unique?
general 2020-09-13 07:25:46 i saw something like it a few days ago
general 2020-09-13 07:26:51 if rickje adds logic gates the way i think they would work, i would be able to create a missile with tnt that would actually work
general 2020-09-13 07:27:11 not what i mean ii
general 2020-09-13 07:27:41 and sensors to make those gates actually useful
general 2020-09-13 07:28:15 they dont sense anything
general 2020-09-13 07:28:17 they just push
general 2020-09-13 07:28:33 nope
general 2020-09-13 07:28:56 if thats adequate "sensing" for you then i doubt you would be able to make adequate use of actual logic gates and sensors
general 2020-09-13 07:29:16 and i play roblox
general 2020-09-13 07:29:46 jesus what is your status

general 2020-09-13 07:38:58 i literally only invented it for the rank because i build actually good things normally
general 2020-09-13 07:39:04 i deleted it the second i got the rank
general 2020-09-13 07:39:51 it was literally a floating net launcher
general 2020-09-13 07:40:03 the only reason i put it on a boat was to increase the block count lmao
general 2020-09-13 07:40:34 how long ago was it made so you cant get inventor role anymore

general 2020-09-14 00:50:41 do you use an exploit engine to download all the stuff and then you put it on v3rmillion or something and then someone can use another exploit to auto build it?
the-dump 2020-09-14 00:54:49 hey guys rate my character out of 10
the-dump 2020-09-14 05:11:14 whoever invented cream cheese was just like "mm moist cheese"
the-dump 2020-09-14 05:11:50 jail is just a location
the-dump 2020-09-14 05:12:14 if age is just a number, sister is just a relationship
general 2020-09-14 07:45:24 assuming no mutations and you're a dude, you have the exact same y chromosome as your brother, father, father's father, father's father's father, and every father on your father's side of the family
general 2020-09-14 07:45:54 so y chromosomes sort of like, asexually reproduce

general 2020-09-14 07:57:30 they just felt bad
general 2020-09-14 07:57:56 wedges are for people who like aesthetic
general 2020-09-14 07:58:40 there was this game called resistance which was just like 6 people around a table trying to do something or something
general 2020-09-14 07:58:52 and i was like a fucking detective in that game
general 2020-09-14 07:59:01 i could figure out who it was easy peasy pp squeezy

general 2020-09-14 08:08:09 lame
general 2020-09-14 08:08:26 this is capitalism, free shit is literally communism and shouldnt be allowed
general 2020-09-14 08:09:22 aight
general 2020-09-14 08:09:29 heres the deal with submarines
general 2020-09-14 08:09:39 put engines facing upwards
general 2020-09-14 08:09:44 spawn on water
general 2020-09-14 08:09:46 boom
general 2020-09-14 08:10:10 i dunno man i did the best i could
general 2020-09-14 08:10:16 i personally just do stuff with warp drives
general 2020-09-14 08:10:52 anyways yeah, ballast blocks are for cowards
general 2020-09-14 08:11:15 just use engines to push the nose down and have forward thrusters and you should be fine as long as you dont float too much
general 2020-09-14 08:15:27 you're a coward for thinking otherwise
general 2020-09-14 08:15:41 my opinion is the only one that counts
general 2020-09-14 08:15:46 i am an alpha gamer
general 2020-09-14 08:18:30 i dont even know what that is
general 2020-09-14 08:19:13 if you wanted to check my roles for evidence of my alpha gamerness, you should have checked like a year and a half ago before the super sonic engineer and warp drive roles were removed
general 2020-09-14 08:27:38 pretty sure a stud's real life equivilent is like 1.5 inches
general 2020-09-14 08:27:51 5 centimeters
general 2020-09-14 08:27:55 thats how big a stud is
general 2020-09-14 08:28:42 so you need to go 6800 sps to go mach 1
general 2020-09-14 08:28:59 wrong
general 2020-09-14 08:29:02 its if you u-
general 2020-09-14 08:29:12 its if you use studs
general 2020-09-14 08:29:19 studs real life size is 5 centimeters
general 2020-09-14 08:29:38 so to go 340 meters per second, you need to go 6800 studs per second
general 2020-09-14 08:29:43 oh
general 2020-09-14 08:58:47 give it water so it can puff up
general 2020-09-14 08:58:55 also that looks like a big puffer
general 2020-09-14 08:59:14 i wish fish were real
general 2020-09-14 08:59:40 as a pet?
general 2020-09-14 09:00:07 well if youre gonna keep it as a pet put it in some water so it doesnt drown
general 2020-09-14 09:00:56 fun fact: my fish drowned
general 2020-09-14 09:01:22 the power went out for about a week so the poor guy's bubbler stopped working and my fish fucking drowned
general 2020-09-14 09:19:10 i wonder what the fastest vehicle that doesnt use helium is
general 2020-09-14 09:19:21 i made one that goes 300,000 sps before breaking
general 2020-09-14 09:28:35 bro he read the entire wall of rules for it
general 2020-09-14 09:41:06 this neural network module that im writing is going to give me a stroke and im resorting to getting into contact with professionals to help me finish it
general 2020-09-14 09:41:19 aliens
general 2020-09-14 09:41:40 also scientists didnt invent angles
general 2020-09-14 09:41:43 fuckin nerds did
general 2020-09-14 09:42:15 math aint science
general 2020-09-14 09:42:46 math exists because humans got bored and eventually it turned out that math was actually really useful
general 2020-09-14 09:42:55 math was basically a hobby until 200 years ago
general 2020-09-14 09:43:36 then monki brain got carried away and figured out how to launch things to the moon
general 2020-09-14 09:43:47 ah yes
general 2020-09-14 09:44:08 moon is just math but big
general 2020-09-14 09:44:24 everything is math because it turns out the number of bananas has something to do with the underlying existance of the universe
general 2020-09-14 10:07:41 im currently trying to create the best neural-network based sword fighting bot
general 2020-09-14 10:07:55 and im trying to base it off of alpha zero
general 2020-09-14 10:08:04 but i think this is going to be too much data for roblox to handle
general 2020-09-14 10:08:07 we shall see though
general 2020-09-14 10:08:53 <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-09-14 10:09:05 np
general 2020-09-14 10:11:51 pizza culture
general 2020-09-14 10:14:09 why do so many countries just have colored lines for flags
general 2020-09-14 10:14:15 not creative at all
general 2020-09-14 10:14:44 i should colonize antarctica and create an empire just so i can make an actually sauce looking flag
general 2020-09-14 10:15:04 cusm
general 2020-09-14 10:15:54 pretty sure the british did
general 2020-09-14 19:54:14 wait what reason do people have to burn the canadian flag
general 2020-09-14 19:54:21 is canadia making too much syrup again
general 2020-09-14 19:58:51 its even smokier today
general 2020-09-14 19:58:59 can someone tell fire to stop
general 2020-09-14 19:59:01 actually wait
general 2020-09-14 19:59:20 if the fires burn everything that there is to be burned, then theres less chance of fire next year
general 2020-09-14 19:59:26 i would, if i had $5
general 2020-09-14 22:09:52 my dad wont take a break on manual labor unless i take break first
general 2020-09-14 22:10:01 hes trying to flex on me
general 2020-09-14 22:10:10 cant, because i always take a break first
general 2020-09-14 22:10:16 ah yes
general 2020-09-14 22:10:40 i would die before he dies despite him being 67

general 2020-09-14 23:03:28 madattak kidnapped rick and is currently beign rickje
general 2020-09-14 23:03:41 rick would never say rickjeroll was his friend
general 2020-09-14 23:03:45 rickjeroll hacked rickje
general 2020-09-14 23:06:34 not particularly
general 2020-09-14 23:06:50 yeah admin sounds good
general 2020-09-14 23:07:13 community manager is for noobs with red names
general 2020-09-14 23:08:48 v0xel is actually rickje's main but since v0xel only managed to get admin, rick wanted to go higher so v0xel made his alt, rickje
general 2020-09-14 23:10:49 make missiles faster so that shredder bugs can be destroyed
general 2020-09-14 23:33:50 how fast do i have to make something go without using helium in order to become CEO of Innovation
general 2020-09-14 23:44:06 i wish i could get out of bed as easily as my dog can get out of bed to go bark at nothing
general 2020-09-15 00:15:23 whoever invented cats is literally a god
general 2020-09-15 00:15:35 like little house monsters that are adorable
general 2020-09-15 00:15:54 didnt roblox fix motors for rick
general 2020-09-15 02:39:57 allow me to whisper softly into your ear "hamburger cheese"
general 2020-09-15 05:23:38 have i ever told you guys that im the leader of a gang
general 2020-09-15 05:23:41 its called leaf gang
general 2020-09-15 05:23:52 and we dress up as leaves and visit games and mess with people
general 2020-09-15 18:48:05 Can someone make the smoke go away so I can at least go outside during the power outage
general 2020-09-15 18:49:25 <@389756407483990028> fires are on the pacific coast, not the atlantic
general 2020-09-15 18:54:51 We should set california in its entirety on fire every few years so that bad years like this done happen
general 2020-09-15 18:56:40 Wait, california actually sets itself on fire normally?
general 2020-09-15 18:57:22 Don't worry about getting into an argument if you have an anime pfp because you lose by default
general 2020-09-15 18:58:39 Wait so the british bad word is on da filter
general 2020-09-15 21:15:27 rabbits are idiots
general 2020-09-15 21:15:32 they run when they hear something
general 2020-09-15 21:15:37 and they're made out of food

general 2020-09-15 21:30:39 thats just radically dumb my guy
general 2020-09-15 21:31:02 precisely, no politics, that is why we should take the politics out of scientific departments
general 2020-09-15 21:31:06 aight ill stop
general 2020-09-15 21:32:02 rabbits dont deserve rights
general 2020-09-15 21:32:03 theyre dumb

general 2020-09-15 21:32:48 last i checked monke cant type
general 2020-09-15 21:35:54 im in 2 tech/science discords and neither of them have rules but both of them have moderators
general 2020-09-15 21:36:02 they just expect you to know how to be a decent human being
general 2020-09-15 21:36:05 its so nice
general 2020-09-15 21:36:20 no
general 2020-09-15 21:37:52 the government disguised a human as a monke

general 2020-09-15 21:41:53 do robo furries
general 2020-09-15 21:41:54 exist
general 2020-09-15 21:42:11 machines are elegant and precise
general 2020-09-15 21:42:37 yet you project your dumb furriness onto machines, basically insulting them
general 2020-09-15 21:42:52 the AI that eventually takes us over wont treat protos kindly
general 2020-09-15 21:53:51 how the hell
general 2020-09-15 21:53:53 what
general 2020-09-15 21:54:11 thats gotta be an exploit
general 2020-09-15 21:54:41 how
general 2020-09-15 21:54:42 explain

general 2020-09-15 21:55:25 if you dont i will sue you
general 2020-09-15 22:13:01 i have created literal alien technology
general 2020-09-15 22:13:06 instant warp drive
general 2020-09-16 01:03:20 me and my friend did some experiments with my warp powered fidget spinner drive and so far these are the results
general 2020-09-16 01:03:22 
general 2020-09-16 01:03:26 
general 2020-09-16 01:03:30 
general 2020-09-16 08:16:48 hUh
general 2020-09-16 08:16:50 whats going on
general 2020-09-16 08:20:37 wait vip was banned?
general 2020-09-16 08:20:48 why
general 2020-09-16 08:21:22 cool
general 2020-09-16 08:21:29 speaking of anyways
general 2020-09-16 08:22:15 im training 1000 neural networks 1000 epochs each because theres a bug with them that i need to get sorted out, but i didnt expect it to take this long
general 2020-09-16 08:22:26 takes about 10 seconds to train each neural network
general 2020-09-16 08:22:45 so, 10,000 seconds
general 2020-09-16 08:23:21 so in total its going to take 2.77_ hours to complete
general 2020-09-16 08:23:25 oh hi rick
general 2020-09-16 08:23:43 what did he do
general 2020-09-16 08:52:37 im basically halfway to being budha, i can eat the spiciest pepper in the world and control myself to not cough or anything
general 2020-09-16 08:52:44 now i need to figure out how to ignore the fact that im dying
general 2020-09-16 09:27:13 i keep seeing these onion articles that i have never seen before and i smile every time
general 2020-09-16 09:29:05 i created a warp powered fidget spinner drive, if you need to get the hell away from something fast, its your best bet
general 2020-09-16 09:29:14 oh, yeah
general 2020-09-16 09:29:25 basically if someone you dont know mentions robux, block them
general 2020-09-16 09:30:24 ay rick whats your opinion on birds?
general 2020-09-16 09:30:28 do you think theyre real?
general 2020-09-16 09:31:03 good
general 2020-09-16 09:31:08 oh
general 2020-09-16 09:31:31 oh
general 2020-09-16 09:32:03 oh yeah just dont click links from people you dont know
general 2020-09-16 09:32:18 and if you're in sketchy discords, dont click links from people you know either
general 2020-09-16 09:32:34 also yeah rick whats your opinion on birds
general 2020-09-16 09:33:41 the entire english class tried to convince our english teacher that pigeons werent real
general 2020-09-16 09:33:54 we were all on the same page like "have you ever seen a baby pigeon?"
general 2020-09-16 09:34:41 ive always wanted to learn english
general 2020-09-16 09:34:43 never have
general 2020-09-16 09:36:04 damn i remember the cutting edge graphics of 2006
general 2020-09-16 09:36:08 the dark ages
general 2020-09-16 09:43:39 maybe i should take part in one of the contests
general 2020-09-16 09:43:54 but theyre all visual and about good looking stuff
general 2020-09-16 09:44:00 visuals are for el noobs
general 2020-09-16 09:44:17 im all about building warp powered fidget spinner drives
general 2020-09-16 09:45:07 i want challenges, not art competitions
general 2020-09-16 09:47:35 i got inventor by finding something that people didnt invent yet and inventing it
general 2020-09-16 09:47:42 i invented a net launcher that was also on a boat
general 2020-09-16 09:47:53 the boat was just to add the parts necessary to get the actual rank
general 2020-09-16 09:48:03 it wasnt
general 2020-09-16 09:48:10 in fact i deleted it right after i got the rank
general 2020-09-16 09:48:36 it is probably the most boring thing i've invented
general 2020-09-16 09:48:50 i mess with stuff
general 2020-09-16 09:49:10 i discovered an inferior version of the warp drive that used like 5 pistons and a disconnector
general 2020-09-16 09:49:15 it was super weird
general 2020-09-16 09:49:27 later i created a better version
general 2020-09-16 09:49:34 and i've been messing with that ever since
general 2020-09-16 09:50:18 maybe i will invent an ***extra powerful*** suspension cannon for the hell of it
general 2020-09-16 10:11:14 pretty sure evidence isnt real in among us
general 2020-09-16 10:12:39 i am rank 91,000 in folding@home
general 2020-09-16 10:12:45 which is pretty good
general 2020-09-16 10:13:29 out of 2.76 million people, i'm the 91,000's most helpful person for folding proteins
general 2020-09-16 10:13:40 makes me feel nice
general 2020-09-16 10:13:59 a song is cool
general 2020-09-16 10:14:14 but 91,000th best donator is pretty good
general 2020-09-16 10:14:53 well when you get cured of covid19 by the chemical that my computer finds, you will think that folding@home is cooler
general 2020-09-16 10:24:58 <#623337136267067393>
general 2020-09-16 10:53:12 i dont mean to be offensive or anything,
general 2020-09-16 10:53:29 but builds of real world things are lame
general 2020-09-16 10:53:45 build something that does something cool
general 2020-09-16 10:54:13 i meant artistic builds are lame
general 2020-09-16 10:54:32 making roblox do weird shit is where its at
general 2020-09-16 10:54:47 warp powered spinny machines that instantly warp you into the deadlands
general 2020-09-16 10:54:51 now thats what im talking about
general 2020-09-16 10:55:30 maybe i can make something artistic out of my spinny machines
general 2020-09-16 17:57:32 the military should just use some of its money for fun and make an A10 warthog who's thrusters have been replaced with its big gun
general 2020-09-16 17:58:15 ay im not an expert or anything
general 2020-09-16 17:58:26 but i dont think those jet engines are exactly normal jet line engines
general 2020-09-16 17:58:41 that too
general 2020-09-16 17:59:17 well, the thing aint doing bombing runs on enemy bases
general 2020-09-16 17:59:46 i would imagine they would use something designed for bombing runs on enemy bases to do that
general 2020-09-16 18:00:17 well you're kinda a noob
general 2020-09-16 18:00:45 AC130
general 2020-09-16 18:00:47 forgot what that is
general 2020-09-16 18:01:00 OH WAIT its that cargo plane that they shoved as many weapons as they could into it
general 2020-09-16 18:02:25 i would imagine that with modern day computers, planes like the flying fortress would be viable especially if theyre in a group together and communicate with eachother to accurately triangulate targets
general 2020-09-16 18:03:15 ac-130 is good for blowing shit up, a-10 is good for uhhHHH blowing shit up
general 2020-09-16 18:03:27 but in a specific kind of way
general 2020-09-16 18:06:09 yo dawg if the biggest threat to aircraft carriers is missiles then why dont they just make the aircraft carrier go under water when its not launching planes or landing them
general 2020-09-16 18:06:45 yeah, clearly it should fly so it can avoid torpedos instead
general 2020-09-16 18:08:07 if you put the aircraft carrier in the sky, just get like 10 of those anti-missile BRRT machines
general 2020-09-16 18:14:12 fun fact: english is basically 3 different languages working together
general 2020-09-16 18:14:23 you got: French, Latin, and Anglish
general 2020-09-16 18:36:20 AAAAA
general 2020-09-16 18:36:25 WHO LIMITED THE MAGNETS
general 2020-09-16 18:39:12 i love my warp powered fidget spinner drive, its reliable and gets you where you need to go
general 2020-09-16 22:23:37 i flew my plane through the islands turbines but somehow literally just my seat and a few blocks around it got away unscathed
general 2020-09-16 22:23:47 rest in peace noob worm
general 2020-09-16 22:23:52 he died smiling
general 2020-09-17 02:38:34 is there a rule against trapping people in a box on their own plot?
general 2020-09-17 02:38:43 he was making a shredder bug so i didnt want him to get out
general 2020-09-17 02:48:37 i put this guy in a box because he was making a shredder bug and i gotta make sure im not breaking any rules
general 2020-09-17 04:32:04 yo wtf when did wearing a mask become a political statement
general 2020-09-17 18:57:45 i wish that players who blocked you cant just phase through you
general 2020-09-17 18:57:56 that way i could build cages around those shredder bugs
general 2020-09-17 18:58:01 and make them leave
general 2020-09-17 18:58:24 i do it normally, but half the time they realize they can just block me and i cant do anything about it
general 2020-09-17 19:35:29 my friend refused to make an among us ripoff with me
general 2020-09-17 19:35:43 he said he wants to be original
general 2020-09-17 19:35:49 i guess hes forgotten hes on roblox
general 2020-09-17 19:35:51 oh well
general 2020-09-17 19:36:33 i mean i was joking when i proposed the idea but when he unironically said that he wanted to be original, i already knew that he wouldnt be able to make it in modern roblox
general 2020-09-17 19:37:01 ideas arent cheap, they take time. cant be original on roblox or else someone who is unoriginal will take you over
general 2020-09-17 19:37:16 though theres the occasional good game, like plane crazy
general 2020-09-17 19:37:23 and galaxy to an extent
general 2020-09-17 20:42:33 if there was evidence for a benevolent god existing, it would have something to do with cheese, i guarantee it
general 2020-09-17 20:57:47 yo dawg whats POPPIN right now
general 2020-09-17 20:57:51 radical
general 2020-09-17 20:58:00 about what
general 2020-09-17 20:58:07 i need to know if i can get in on the argument
general 2020-09-17 20:58:57 whos this mikesole fella
general 2020-09-17 20:59:13 and why is savoic being toxic
general 2020-09-17 20:59:50 ok thanks dyno
general 2020-09-17 20:59:56 grammer angry moustache manning
general 2020-09-17 21:00:38 hey obc, is there a rule against making giant cages and trapping people who make shredder bugs inside their own plot
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:23:51 wait what happened with my creation
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:23:58 was i supposed to use a bot to post it or something
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:25:00 i posted a gif but it just deleted it
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:25:18 ah well
general 2020-09-17 22:44:39 <@!472528822072246274> is advertising in DMs
general 2020-09-18 00:10:58 imagine if plane crazy got infinitely large building areas
general 2020-09-18 00:11:10 may or may not be foreshadowing
general 2020-09-18 00:11:56 i mean if you used the infinite build area then yes, roblox would most certainly crash
general 2020-09-18 00:13:54 water bottle flip machine
general 2020-09-18 00:40:13 spiders are cool
general 2020-09-18 00:40:17 i want a spider
general 2020-09-18 00:40:55 spiders are just trying to help
general 2020-09-18 00:41:44 spiders are literally just trying to help
general 2020-09-18 00:41:53 if ya have spiders in your house, ya have bugs in your house
general 2020-09-18 00:41:59 the spiders are trying to help to get rid of the bugs
general 2020-09-18 00:42:36 who are you

general 2020-09-18 09:01:52 monkeys are cool because theyre dumber than humans but still incredibly intelligent, its like how we laugh at dumb humans but monkeys are better because its expected, so it isnt disappointing
general 2020-09-18 09:06:53 somebody should program a version of roblox that can be played on a ti-84 graphing calculator
general 2020-09-18 09:08:46 rip
general 2020-09-18 09:10:38 the math teacher in my trigonometry class made us put our phones in a "phone hotel", and i always finished the math homework in-class in about 10 minutes without even listening to the teacher explaining how to do it, so for the entire rest of the period i would just mess with the graphing calculators
general 2020-09-18 09:11:51 wasnt an anecdote
general 2020-09-18 09:11:55 it was vital information
general 2020-09-18 09:11:58 character building

general 2020-09-18 09:13:21 phil swift
general 2020-09-18 09:14:58 hmm seems kinda sus
general 2020-09-18 09:15:00 we should vote him off
general 2020-09-18 09:16:53 i was kinda hoping he would get the wrong one by mistake
general 2020-09-18 09:16:55 LOL
general 2020-09-18 09:17:04 oh i thought you kicked them
general 2020-09-18 09:17:05 aw
general 2020-09-18 09:21:51 i got a permanent warn like a year ago
general 2020-09-18 09:21:55 i dont even remember how
general 2020-09-18 09:28:35 motors are a powerful and dangerous tool
general 2020-09-18 09:28:51 no you havent
general 2020-09-18 09:28:54 i got here yesterday
general 2020-09-18 09:29:02 absolutely not
general 2020-09-18 09:29:12 no
general 2020-09-18 09:29:16 that doesnt sound like me at all
general 2020-09-18 09:29:23 do you have me confused with someone?
general 2020-09-18 09:29:31 you certainly do
general 2020-09-18 09:29:42 im not so sure about that
general 2020-09-18 09:29:56 maybe their pfp looked similar and they had future in their name
general 2020-09-18 09:30:13 hmm strange
general 2020-09-18 09:30:18 how are you sure
general 2020-09-18 09:30:31 idk
general 2020-09-18 09:30:31 maybe they left
general 2020-09-18 09:30:54 im fooling everybody but the guy im trying to fool
general 2020-09-18 09:30:57 god
general 2020-09-18 09:31:22 but yeah you've probably seen me
general 2020-09-18 09:31:44 since i've been here for 2 and a half years
general 2020-09-18 09:34:58 no
general 2020-09-18 09:36:02 aint it kinda weird how we're not allowed to have angry moustache man as our pfp but the guy who got even more killed is perfectly fine
general 2020-09-18 09:36:17 didnt stalin order the execution of an entire city once
general 2020-09-18 09:37:01 i mean at least stalin wasnt racist
general 2020-09-18 09:37:14 he committed crimes against humanity against whoever he felt like
general 2020-09-18 09:37:16 so thats nice
general 2020-09-18 09:39:01 didnt germany declare war on hungary or something and that started world war 1
general 2020-09-18 09:39:37 basically world war 1 started because people got bored
general 2020-09-18 09:39:57 and typing the first 3 words of that sentence gave me extreme deja vu
general 2020-09-18 09:41:26 my hair is good, doesnt have any split ends despite not being cut for over a year at this point
general 2020-09-18 09:41:38 idk what ladies are complaining about
general 2020-09-18 09:41:41 "split ends"
general 2020-09-18 09:41:43 inferior hair
general 2020-09-18 09:42:02 the allies declared war on germany, yes
general 2020-09-18 09:42:16 he was
general 2020-09-18 09:42:32 since the allies told him that if he invaded poland, they would declare war on him
general 2020-09-18 09:43:26 thats like saying if the united states invaded canada and the EU declared war on the US, that the war was the EU's fault
general 2020-09-18 09:44:28 im hoping that the internet basically mixes up the worlds opinions enough that we all get similar enough opinions to where we can unite as one big ol country
general 2020-09-18 09:47:20 you know, a month ago i was onboard with the whole "anime pfp's opinions dont count"
general 2020-09-18 09:48:17 then i joined some tech and programming discords, and after seeing how many really, really smart weebs there were, i've changed my opinion
general 2020-09-18 09:48:27 but i havent seen any smart furries yet so im still going to hate on them
general 2020-09-18 09:49:11 i need to sleep
general 2020-09-18 09:49:14 good night gamers
general 2020-09-18 09:49:55 wait theres a furry
general 2020-09-18 09:49:56 where
general 2020-09-18 09:50:03 oh its the robo furry thing
general 2020-09-18 18:48:47 oh my god
general 2020-09-18 19:10:49 dumbass dog
general 2020-09-18 21:43:41 lets be honest, the only unfunny person here is yours truly
general 2020-09-19 02:37:13 i made an ejection seat for my noob plane and i talked to my friend for like 10 minutes and hes still flying around doing his own thing https://gyazo.com/968957b49c853734239f66dd26c43f10
general 2020-09-19 02:37:26 hes made like 7 circles around us and hes staying at about the same distance
general 2020-09-19 02:38:15 hes such a good boy
general 2020-09-19 02:38:20 doesnt run away when im not watching him
general 2020-09-19 03:05:39 my noob plane has been circling above spawn for about 20 minutes at this point
general 2020-09-19 03:05:57 since i tested an ejection seat and hes just flying around
general 2020-09-19 04:46:19 and of course its girl on girl
general 2020-09-19 04:47:24 mmhmm
general 2020-09-19 06:41:03 i like how the thumbnail is still "one million visits! thats just plane crazy"
general 2020-09-19 06:41:12 meanwhile plane crazy has 63 million visits now

the-dump 2020-09-20 07:42:42 
general 2020-09-20 07:46:08 i personally think we should design a new language and make it illegal to speak any language other than that
general 2020-09-20 08:04:48 i didnt know fainting because of nervousness was actually a thing until this kid in the school band fainted
general 2020-09-20 08:05:46 yeah
general 2020-09-20 08:09:18 i wonder why its so easy to break your thumb ligament
general 2020-09-20 08:09:35 you just hold your thumb with your other 4 fingers and twist foreward
general 2020-09-20 08:09:37 yeah that
general 2020-09-20 08:09:59 to ligament the thumb
general 2020-09-20 09:27:15 my second favorite scp is the 4th dimentional spiders that suck your brain into the 4th dimention
general 2020-09-20 09:27:39 but dont worry because we have a defence mechanism against it, have you ever felt like you're falling when you're asleep?
general 2020-09-20 09:27:49 well the little jerk you do breaks the spiders web
general 2020-09-20 09:28:01 a fun little idea
general 2020-09-20 09:28:15 yeah
general 2020-09-20 09:29:08 but dont worry, just dont be near the spiders web and you should be fine
general 2020-09-20 09:29:13 the web being a weird protein
general 2020-09-20 09:29:27 i forgot the scp number so you can look it up
general 2020-09-20 09:30:00 no
general 2020-09-20 09:30:37 the actual scp is a protein found in people who die in their sleep
general 2020-09-20 09:31:35 but the protein is actually 4 dimentional, meaning it can move into the 4th dimention, and this protein is what the spiders use to know when somebody's brain is snared in their net,
general 2020-09-20 09:32:15 and then they come along and try to use the web to pull your brain into the 4th dimention, your brain does a hypnic jerk and breaks the web
general 2020-09-20 09:32:53 anyways i gotta go to bed
general 2020-09-20 09:32:54 goodnighty
general 2020-09-20 19:05:13 replications are LAME
general 2020-09-20 19:05:25 make something epic like magnet powered fidget spinner

the-dump 2020-09-27 05:27:15 da fuc they doin over dere
general 2020-09-27 19:10:44 me and my friends made a cult called "leaf gang" where we dress up as leaves and terrorize children. But we also have our lore
general 2020-09-27 19:10:52 would you guys like to learn about leaf gangster lore?
general 2020-09-27 19:11:17 i will take that as a yes
general 2020-09-27 19:12:46 first and foremost, we have man worm, the god of destruction. He was released by the old gods due to humanity forgetting about the old gods. man worm destroyed most of humanity until his benevolent little brother, noob worm, came and defeated him. noob worm sealed man worm away under a mountain in brazil to hopefully never be seen again
general 2020-09-27 19:13:19 then we have omba, i've honestly forgotten what hes the god of but he doesnt really matter because man worm consumed him so who cares about a dead god
general 2020-09-27 19:13:26 then we have the kill machine
general 2020-09-27 19:13:59 man worm's right hand man, the kill machine runs mafias and organized crime all across the globe hoping to procure resources to release his master from brazil
general 2020-09-27 19:14:07 and i think thats all the gods
general 2020-09-27 19:15:52 NEIN
general 2020-09-28 03:38:21 damn we need another big nuke to go off because why not
general 2020-09-28 03:38:26 it would look cool
general 2020-09-28 03:55:13 it calls itself communist but its actually capitalist
general 2020-09-28 07:31:53 would storing 322 million values use up all of my computers ram?
general 2020-09-28 07:32:21 oh this computer has 16 gigabytes anyways nvm
general 2020-09-28 07:33:00 the reason i need to store 322 million values is because im doing machine learning
general 2020-09-28 07:33:03 very sauce
general 2020-09-28 18:09:27 damn why is every different place so different from eachother
general 2020-09-28 18:09:35 we should all unite under a hivemind
general 2020-09-28 20:58:04 i've created a machine learning method that is better with complex inputs than it is with simple inputs
general 2020-09-28 20:58:34 idk why it cant seem to get something simple like XOR but it can learn how to swordfight, but im not complaining
general 2020-09-28 22:28:05 watching my stephens learn is sort of like watching a baby learn
general 2020-09-28 22:28:30 first it starts out spazzing and stuff, but then it quickly calms down and then starts figuring things out little by little
general 2020-09-28 22:29:04 machine learning is cool
general 2020-09-28 22:30:01 what do you mean by that
general 2020-09-28 22:30:14 B)
general 2020-09-28 22:30:31 well my AIs dont really self learn, but they are getting close
general 2020-09-28 22:31:02 TECHNICALLY humans dont self learn, we have built in award things that are triggered by certain stimuli. so in that aspect, my bots are self learning
general 2020-09-28 22:31:09 potentially
general 2020-09-28 22:31:19 if i code them correctly they can learn to speak
general 2020-09-28 22:31:44 but these guys dont speak, they just kill eachother
general 2020-09-28 22:32:40 i designed a machine learning method based off of hebbian learning, and it learns surprisingly quickly
general 2020-09-28 22:32:49 no no, i couldnt make a concious ai
general 2020-09-28 22:32:53 my computer isnt strong enough
general 2020-09-28 22:33:24 i do have one
general 2020-09-28 22:33:38 a 1660 cant run something as consciosu as a human
general 2020-09-28 22:34:05 ???
general 2020-09-28 22:34:10 Ai uses graphics card power
general 2020-09-28 22:34:20 look up leela chess zero
general 2020-09-28 22:34:27 it uses graphics cards to speed up its thinking
general 2020-09-28 22:34:42 duh
general 2020-09-28 22:35:05 ????
general 2020-09-28 22:35:16 graphics cards arent necessarily for graphics
general 2020-09-28 22:35:23 theyre for parallel computing
general 2020-09-28 22:35:27 which is what graphics is, yes
general 2020-09-28 22:35:41 but AI takes advantage of that to run its calculations
general 2020-09-28 22:36:16 but yeah my computer is strong enough to make a brain about the size of that of a worms
general 2020-09-28 22:36:27 wait are you actually trolling
general 2020-09-28 22:36:33 i cant tell
general 2020-09-28 22:37:50 ever heard of tensor cores?
general 2020-09-28 22:38:09 theyre put on the most modern graphics cards because they do calculations of tensors really, really fast
general 2020-09-28 22:38:14 thousands of times faster than a CPU
general 2020-09-28 22:38:29 bruh
general 2020-09-28 22:38:43 if you dont even know how a graphics card works you shouldnt talk about it
general 2020-09-28 22:39:39 anyways why are you getting so worked up about me being happy that my robots are learning how to sword fight
general 2020-09-28 22:40:03 lol
general 2020-09-28 22:43:20 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2020-09-28 22:44:43 oh, oliv is making the argument that cpus are more important to machine learning because if the cpu wasnt there nothing would happen
general 2020-09-28 22:45:13 so basically the same as saying that if you didnt have a cpu then your graphics card wouldnt be able to do graphics calculations
general 2020-09-28 22:53:19 bruh oliv is just saying that if you didnt have a good cpu then your ai would only be 10 times as good if you had a graphics card
general 2020-09-28 23:34:45 i like watching my noodle water because it has little particles in it so i can see the convection currents moving
general 2020-09-28 23:55:47 hey does anybody have 74,500 dollars that they can donate to me
general 2020-09-28 23:55:50 i need robo dog

general 2020-09-28 23:56:14 this noob
general 2020-09-28 23:56:33 thats a ponsey scheme or whatever and thats illegal so no
general 2020-09-29 01:15:48 i dont think my training method will ever get to god like status like alphazero and leela chess zero, just because of its nature. but it can get pretty good and it figures out problems extremely fast because of its nature
general 2020-09-29 01:19:45 thickje 😩👌

general 2020-09-30 18:47:44 stinky
general 2020-09-30 18:49:00 im in this other gaming discord for a competitive game and i swear like half the people there are from 4chan
general 2020-09-30 18:49:03 you know the type
general 2020-09-30 18:49:14 collects gore, spams racial slurs
general 2020-09-30 18:49:15 those guys
general 2020-09-30 18:49:47 nah its just 4chan in particular
general 2020-09-30 18:49:50 this place is cool though
general 2020-09-30 18:50:04 yeah, those are just 4chan in general
general 2020-09-30 18:50:12 if you arent in 4chan, then you dont do all that bad stuff
general 2020-09-30 18:50:22 bruh vip
general 2020-09-30 18:50:57 well i guess if you count people who go on 4chan as "people on the internet in general" then yeah i guess you're right
general 2020-09-30 18:51:25 its not necessary to use 4chan, but 95% of the time a gore spammer uses 4chan
general 2020-09-30 18:51:37 its just where they feel safe, like theyre with other people who are just as annoying as themselves
general 2020-09-30 18:52:15 which is why when i become dictator of the world i will make 4chan illegal and put everyone in it in jail
general 2020-09-30 18:52:21 boom, world is instantly a better place
general 2020-09-30 18:53:29 tiktok is chill compared to 4chan
general 2020-09-30 18:53:45 <@!670939038999511041> 4chan is where all the people who spam gore and racial slurs hang out
general 2020-09-30 18:54:16 if people are willing to die for a tiktok challenge then its just natural selection honestly
general 2020-09-30 18:54:33 because the only reason those challenges get popular is BECAUSE people know theyre dangerous
general 2020-09-30 20:35:35 is it illegal to make a robot that beats up children
general 2020-09-30 20:38:52 worth it
general 2020-09-30 20:39:19 you can buy bipedal robots from boston dynamics
general 2020-09-30 20:39:27 what if i program one to go around punching children
general 2020-09-30 20:39:59 ill make it autonymous so that they cant trace it back to me
general 2020-09-30 20:40:45 ill use it like a year after i buy it because they cant arrest everyone who bought a robot within the last year
general 2020-09-30 20:42:13 well good luck finding out its me just by the date i bought it
general 2020-09-30 20:43:15 yeah
general 2020-09-30 20:43:25 they know when i bought it and who i am
general 2020-09-30 20:43:28 not what i used it for
general 2020-09-30 20:43:57 speaking of robots:

general 2020-10-01 06:21:13 i love my little AI that im making
general 2020-10-01 06:21:51 hes using a custom machine learning function that i wrote, and every time it goes through a training session you can notice a difference, especially when it fixes a big problem it has
general 2020-10-01 06:22:01 stephen sword fights <@!409676438682206218>
general 2020-10-01 06:22:18 his name is stephen, after stephen hawking because he was cool
general 2020-10-01 06:22:34 yeah he was radical
general 2020-10-01 06:22:35 tubular even
general 2020-10-01 06:23:35 i tried making a swordfighting ai before this that used neuroevolution, it was god awful, maybe after 10,000 years it would be able to reliably aim its sword at its enemy
general 2020-10-01 06:24:11 so i tried my hand at writing a backpropagation function, i could never get it right so i eventually gave up and wrote my own custom function, and it learns SUPER fast, i love it
general 2020-10-01 06:24:19 i feel like robo dad
general 2020-10-01 06:24:34 watching my little robo child figuring out the best way to cut down his enemies

general 2020-10-01 20:10:15 once my stephen project is done and they learn sword fighting, im going to take it a step further
general 2020-10-01 20:10:23 i will create the giant enemy spider
general 2020-10-01 20:10:47 yeah
general 2020-10-01 20:10:57 roblox
general 2020-10-01 20:11:36 i tried scripting backpropagation but i could never get it right so i created my own custom learning function
general 2020-10-01 20:11:52 doesnt need to know the correct answer, it just needs to know whether the answer it gave was better or worse
general 2020-10-01 20:12:03 which is really good for strategy bots like swordfighters
general 2020-10-02 05:44:34 unioning with spheres is like painting with cement

the-dump 2020-10-07 07:44:40 
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:46:30 
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:48:13 not exactly but in a way
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:48:55 its an ai
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:49:23 a neural network is given an image, its outputs are put backwards through the network and that is what pops out
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:49:42 so you are seeing a bunch of patterns that the ai found
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:49:50 quite literally what the ai imagined
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:50:49 yeah, sorta
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:51:37 but it is like what it imagined
the-dump 2020-10-07 07:51:57 the outputs it gave(aka the things it recognized) are put backwards through the net and that pops out
the-dump 2020-10-07 08:06:45 yeah its normal
the-dump 2020-10-07 09:57:50 all used up
general 2020-10-07 22:26:40 ay are there any computer experts i have a question about cooling
general 2020-10-07 22:27:06 would a cat sitting on my computer cause cooling issues
general 2020-10-07 22:27:28 because theres a cat sitting on my computer
general 2020-10-07 22:27:30 and hes fluffy
general 2020-10-07 22:27:38 just making sure that the insulation doesnt do anything bad
general 2020-10-07 22:27:53 no
general 2020-10-07 22:28:00 aight cool
general 2020-10-07 22:28:11 though he undoubtedly sits on it because its warm
general 2020-10-07 22:28:16 so he would be making it even warmer
general 2020-10-07 22:28:53 aight i dont have a filter but i can just get a vaccuum cleaner if it ever starts getting too toasty
the-dump 2020-10-08 01:34:10 oh wow, this debate is actually watchable

general 2020-10-09 05:28:00 why are the small fluffy house monsters the most violent
general 2020-10-09 05:28:07 i would expect dogs to be more violent than cats
general 2020-10-09 05:28:17 but cats will slaughter you if you pet them incorrectly
general 2020-10-09 05:28:27 their heads are empty
general 2020-10-09 05:28:30 void

general 2020-10-10 04:26:23 ?
general 2020-10-10 04:26:26 no its not
general 2020-10-10 04:26:41 bruh i said evolution
general 2020-10-10 04:26:49 not humans deciding to do something nsfw
general 2020-10-10 04:26:58 no
general 2020-10-10 04:26:59 not anymore
general 2020-10-10 04:27:27 only cool original gangsters have inventor anymore
general 2020-10-10 04:27:33 since you cant get it anymore
general 2020-10-10 04:27:36 yes
general 2020-10-10 04:29:09 noob worm is still doing his thing
general 2020-10-10 04:29:52 whoever invented america probably regrets it now
general 2020-10-10 04:30:29 no clue
general 2020-10-10 04:30:38 i've only been here for about a month
general 2020-10-10 04:31:23 i dont remember
general 2020-10-10 04:31:59 lol the first thing i ever invented was a pp
general 2020-10-10 04:32:12 massive one too, it flew too and REALLY well idk how i managed it
general 2020-10-10 04:32:22 but i deleted it like 2 years ago
general 2020-10-10 04:32:26 i mean a month ago
general 2020-10-10 04:32:29 i've only been here for a month
general 2020-10-10 04:33:02 WHAT
general 2020-10-10 04:33:55 you can show a video of yourself in vc you know
general 2020-10-10 05:30:03 speed inf is dumb because it kills you
general 2020-10-10 05:30:20 i think that the speed record should be for a speed that you survive for 3 seconds or more at
general 2020-10-10 05:30:23 so that rules out inf
general 2020-10-10 05:30:44 i created a deadlands machine that goes 300 million SPS
general 2020-10-10 05:31:22 but i also created the interdimensional fidget spinner that can get me going something like 8.03 X 10^38
general 2020-10-10 05:31:33 i went so fast because im hacker
general 2020-10-10 05:31:35 i hack
general 2020-10-10 05:31:37 im hackermans
general 2020-10-10 05:31:47 no its because i use warpdrives
general 2020-10-10 05:32:02 and designed them specifically to be stable at super high speeds
general 2020-10-10 05:32:09 i dont even know what a conveyer drive is
general 2020-10-10 05:32:39 i can guess how to make one though
general 2020-10-10 05:33:39 i wonder what the fastest non-glitch(warp drives arent a glitch because rickje changed magnets to allow for warp drives after accidentally fixing warp drives when i asked him) speed that anybody has gone
general 2020-10-10 05:33:47 no clue
general 2020-10-10 06:13:34 
general 2020-10-10 07:57:33 lmao evan i asked the man if his cousin was a college building B)

the-dump 2020-10-11 02:43:32 well i think like 95% of roblox players are 10 or younger
the-dump 2020-10-11 02:43:40 so it makes sense that they dont have an idea of quality yet
the-dump 2020-10-11 02:44:18 in like 5-10 years when they've grown up roblox's quality games might start getting some players
the-dump 2020-10-11 07:16:43 
general 2020-10-11 18:51:11 why are cats so good
general 2020-10-11 19:05:17 lmao what
general 2020-10-11 19:05:40 corporations trying to relate to the kids via memes is kinda CRINGE BRO
general 2020-10-11 19:42:32 oh i just noticed that plane crazy is on the front page
general 2020-10-11 20:00:19 lmao i am have beard
general 2020-10-11 20:15:00 fat
general 2020-10-11 20:15:28 bunny delicis
general 2020-10-11 20:16:50 there needs to be a speed competition
general 2020-10-11 20:17:13 the fastest that someone can get something without using glitches(warp drives arent glitches) wins
general 2020-10-11 20:17:28 yeah i said that like 30 mins ago >:(
general 2020-10-11 20:18:12 no i said there SHOULD be
general 2020-10-11 20:18:41 yeah we should riot until the admins give us speed competition
general 2020-10-11 20:45:08 they should invent edible rabbit
the-dump 2020-10-11 22:40:04 
general 2020-10-12 02:25:05 the player
general 2020-10-12 17:41:27 the tweet is faaAKE
general 2020-10-12 17:41:43 if it was real my friend would have been spam pinging me
general 2020-10-12 18:02:10 wait what
general 2020-10-12 18:02:39 yeah, theyre "tensor GPUs"
general 2020-10-12 18:03:02 i dont have enough money for a tensor GPU, if i did i absolutely would have gotten one
general 2020-10-12 18:03:46 but even if i could get one it wouldnt be useful for my sword fighting robots since roblox doesnt let me run scripts on the GPU
general 2020-10-12 18:04:04 maybe roblox will let me in the future, but not in the foreseeable future
general 2020-10-12 18:05:25 im in a discord that does machine learning for chess and they use RTX cards, but tensor GPUs are way better of course
general 2020-10-12 18:05:32 okay hold on ill brbr
general 2020-10-12 18:05:52 back
general 2020-10-12 18:06:01 also yeah they do use pretty strong CPUs
general 2020-10-12 18:07:06 yeah, right now the true bottleneck is my motherboard i imagine, its about 12 years old so i have a feeling modern CPUs wont work with it
general 2020-10-12 18:08:21 sorry i didnt hear that last part since i was talking to my dad
general 2020-10-12 18:08:50 well regardless, i do really need a better cpu
general 2020-10-12 18:09:08 actually, no i dont since i use my useless computer that had dumbass engineers since it has a better CPU
general 2020-10-12 18:09:19 it can run about 3 times more stephens at once than my current computer
general 2020-10-12 18:09:30 so i just keep the other one around to train my AI
general 2020-10-12 18:09:55 its fine
general 2020-10-12 18:10:02 also i've gotta go on a walk
general 2020-10-12 18:10:04 so imma head out
general 2020-10-12 18:10:49 yeah
general 2020-10-12 18:11:27 so getting a GPU with a 10 year old CPU is like upgrading the car but having an engine from 1940
general 2020-10-12 18:11:48 also, i dont have any money lol so you dont need to search anything for me, but i appreciate the offer
general 2020-10-12 18:12:29 sure

general 2020-10-13 00:38:04 
general 2020-10-13 00:38:04 long plane
general 2020-10-13 00:40:26 i could make long plane even longer but then it would be too powerful
general 2020-10-13 00:42:57 i mean, yeah, stick plane needs 20 degrees angle of attack to stay level but its worth it
the-dump 2020-10-13 05:11:24

general 2020-10-15 05:46:01 toxicity is a part of life
general 2020-10-15 06:50:50 what is noblox

general 2020-10-16 05:09:21 now its time to give myself a challenge
general 2020-10-16 05:09:23 wide plane
general 2020-10-16 05:14:53 wide plane is going to be a lot harder than expected
general 2020-10-16 05:15:28 long plane was easy, everybody and their illegitimate 3 year old son that they havent been able to see since birth can make it
general 2020-10-16 05:17:33 nvm wide plane was easy
general 2020-10-16 09:22:46 that music is actually pretty good despite it being web stuff

general 2020-10-16 10:03:42 this time i unintentionally killed him

the-dump 2020-10-20 08:49:21 shame
the-dump 2020-10-20 08:49:27 i wonder why roblox bothered removing them
the-dump 2020-10-20 08:50:18 though the logic checking whether or not the lines were enabled and the memory used to store the code for the enabled lines being removed has probably saved roblox like 5$ in electricity costs
the-dump 2020-10-20 08:51:11 my dumbass robots kinda suck at learning

general 2020-10-20 21:39:16 so far its looking to be pretty successful
general 2020-10-20 21:39:31 but i want a spider so once im done with them im probably going to train a neural network to control a spider body

general 2020-10-21 07:58:30 also i could teach it to chase a ball so it could be sorta like robo dog

general 2020-10-22 00:19:09 robo spider is actually adorable to me
general 2020-10-22 02:04:46 creating this giant enemy spider and figuring out what will make him learn faster has taught me some things. such as this part where he dies, and i needed to incentivize him not to die. it taught me that in life, not dying is an important part of being successful
general 2020-10-22 02:05:11 yes indeedie
general 2020-10-22 02:05:41 here let me show you the giant enemy spider im working on <@!587459840255983616>
general 2020-10-22 02:06:50 <@!587459840255983616> here is the giant enemy spider https://gyazo.com/5b9d133b035ab87845ce39adcc2870e6
general 2020-10-22 02:08:20 <@456226577798135808> yes, that is what his name is based on
general 2020-10-22 02:08:37 <@!587459840255983616> its a neural network that is learning to be a spider
general 2020-10-22 02:09:01 hebbian learning
general 2020-10-22 02:09:05 kind of like how we learn
general 2020-10-22 02:09:10 basically, if it stands up, thats good
general 2020-10-22 02:09:13 if it falls down, thats bad
general 2020-10-22 02:09:28 its only stupid right now because its been learning for like 5 minutes
general 2020-10-22 02:09:37 i coded a brain for it
general 2020-10-22 02:10:15 NEIN the code isnt done yet
general 2020-10-22 02:10:42 its called a neural network
general 2020-10-22 02:10:54 its based off of brains except better because they can having floating point values
general 2020-10-22 02:11:08 and i just tweak the little connections between the neurons and it gets better
general 2020-10-22 02:13:21 i developed my own machine learning method because i couldnt for the life of me get backpropagation to work
general 2020-10-22 02:13:27 backpropagation wouldnt work for this anyways so yeah
general 2020-10-22 02:27:08 hes done it
general 2020-10-22 02:27:12 the madman has done it
general 2020-10-22 02:27:26 the giant enemy spider has figured out how to stand perfectly
general 2020-10-22 02:27:34 
general 2020-10-22 02:27:42 1 stud above the ground, jut as he was incentivized to
general 2020-10-22 02:27:46 and standing perfectly still
general 2020-10-22 02:27:51 he is standing perfectly
general 2020-10-22 03:43:26 i turned Giant Enemy Spider's stabilization down so he would have to learn to stabilize himself, and he does *not* look happy https://gyazo.com/cfee8c3e30c0dfc1727882dfe3c75154
general 2020-10-22 03:51:54 new zealand is chad country
general 2020-10-22 03:52:07 imagine if america copied some notes from new zealand
general 2020-10-22 03:52:45 true
general 2020-10-22 03:55:34 about 18 from my experience
general 2020-10-22 03:56:01 hard to tell though since you ahve to take into account weight of the craft and the number of wings and stuff
general 2020-10-22 03:57:31 i can make anything fly
general 2020-10-22 03:57:41 with or without wings
general 2020-10-22 03:58:58 i wonder if i should incentivize the Giant Enemy Spider to learn quicker, so maybe it will figure out how to experiment with ideas and stuff
general 2020-10-22 08:48:23 giant enemy spider has figured out how to stand https://gyazo.com/cfee8c3e30c0dfc1727882dfe3c75154
general 2020-10-22 08:48:53 hes not happy about it though because i turned off his stabilization
general 2020-10-22 22:23:36 i gave the Giant Enemy Spider an upgrade: https://gyazo.com/e44fce17e9dc0573347607e6d122ca59
general 2020-10-22 22:23:59 the head helps with learning because of the extra brain power
general 2020-10-22 22:24:01 definitely
general 2020-10-22 23:36:47 i feel bad for the giant enemy spider https://gyazo.com/daecf1f136fa0eac2e456e6a0f20085f
general 2020-10-22 23:36:50 hes trying so hard
general 2020-10-22 23:37:05 yeah
general 2020-10-22 23:37:31 i wrote everything
general 2020-10-22 23:37:45 the neural network module, the training functions, the inputs and outputs
general 2020-10-22 23:37:51 god, it was painful
general 2020-10-22 23:38:34 its a neural network <@!725583147928125461>
general 2020-10-22 23:38:58 yes im sure it doesnt sound too hard
general 2020-10-22 23:39:50 its pretty difficult. the inputs and outputs are the annoying bit, the scoring system is the difficult bit
the-dump 2020-10-23 02:17:13 
general 2020-10-23 08:11:45 Giant Enemy Spider is having a hard time learning how to go towards his enemy, but he *is* learning
general 2020-10-23 08:12:06 https://gyazo.com/2f28d927c73e812fa3db0c2db1268c64
general 2020-10-23 08:12:08 this guy
general 2020-10-23 08:13:49 "Enemy" is only his middle name, his first and last name are more accurate
general 2020-10-23 08:14:00 hes actually a pretty cool arachnid
general 2020-10-23 08:24:44 attrition is kinda ***bad*** dawg just being honest
general 2020-10-24 04:51:37 why the fuck is there a foot of snow out side
general 2020-10-24 05:48:59 so anime games and then plane crazy
general 2020-10-24 05:49:14 and a furry game
general 2020-10-24 05:49:22 warrior cats
general 2020-10-24 05:49:23 dear god
general 2020-10-24 05:49:46 theres literally only 600 people playing it
general 2020-10-24 05:50:17 im creating a giant enemy spider for my office chair
general 2020-10-24 05:50:20 its good

general 2020-10-24 21:58:41 lincoln didnt even show up
general 2020-10-24 22:36:44 bruh yesterday there was condensation on my cup and now today the air is so dry due to it snowing yesterday that my cup has no condensation
the-dump 2020-10-25 04:48:33 hot
the-dump 2020-10-25 05:47:01 time to get political
the-dump 2020-10-25 05:47:15 the best thing about trump is the tweets since theyre entertaining
the-dump 2020-10-25 05:47:23 all the other politicians are boring
the-dump 2020-10-25 05:47:42 if i was president i would call somebody a douchebag for the hell of it
the-dump 2020-10-25 05:47:47 unprovoked too
general 2020-10-25 05:54:26 i have lived my entire life with both cats and dogs and me, my sisters and my brother can definitively say that cats are better than dogs
general 2020-10-25 05:55:03 lmao theres this part of my city that smells like kidneys
general 2020-10-25 05:55:28 my dad cooks pig kidneys <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-10-25 05:55:37 actually taste pretty epic
general 2020-10-25 05:56:05 apparently the british eat a lot of weird ass shit
general 2020-10-25 05:56:20 since my dad is british and he says people from england eat pig kidneys all teh time
general 2020-10-25 05:56:41 kidney actually tastes pretty good ya'll should try it
general 2020-10-25 06:17:53 the window behind me is colder than freezing but im fine because im training an AI so my computer is keeping my little space nice and warm
general 2020-10-25 08:35:31 its freezing outside so i went for a walk and i noticed that my breathing got slower but deeper
general 2020-10-25 08:35:41 i wonder if thats an evolutionary thing
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:48:12 yo dawg i dont mean to get political but
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:48:22 why is the thumbnail "roblox simulator style"
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:49:10 
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:49:14 god why the emojis
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:49:55 burh
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:50:20 no clue
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:50:28 probably like ben shapiro except not funny
the-dump 2020-10-25 20:50:53 yeah
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:56:51 
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:57:12 behold: the main character of Fire Emblem Three Houses's family tree!
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:58:11 its hard to show but the middle right guy has the same genes as the upper left lady so they're basically the same thing
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:58:31 so the person on the upper left is your grand mother, mother, daughter, and wife if you go that route
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:59:36 no just dont have babies so you dont continue the suffering
the-dump 2020-10-26 02:59:48 also i dont think you can have a daughter who is also your mother in real life
the-dump 2020-10-26 03:00:37 its just a weird situation in this game where the lady's mom is a god but she wanted to bring back her mother so she placed her mothers heart in you and now you're her mother
the-dump 2020-10-26 06:55:18 what kind of skin
general 2020-10-27 01:31:25 imagine if super villains had friends too
general 2020-10-27 01:31:29 they would be unstoppable
general 2020-10-27 01:31:36 since they would have the power of friendship as well
general 2020-10-27 02:08:57 im sexist but only when it comes to cats because dude cats are way friendlier
the-dump 2020-10-27 02:58:36 i have a conspiracy theory
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:00:42 Donald trump is actually a far left genius. he is intentionally ruining any chance that the republicans have at gaining more power in the government for at least a decade likely longer. with the supreme court, he calculated the cost that a conservative court would have versus how much damage it would do to the republican party's chances, and he decided that steamrolling the supreme court would essentially guarantee that the republican part will be damaged for a very long time
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:01:03 its a conspiracy theory theyre all political
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:05:16 yes
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:05:24 whenever i enter the dump its time for political
general 2020-10-27 06:51:15 i hope to some day make enough money to buy all the expensive cheeses that i want to
general 2020-10-27 07:35:09 woop
the-dump 2020-10-27 09:00:30 hes literally made of sticks
the-dump 2020-10-27 09:00:36 how does he weigh that much
the-dump 2020-10-27 23:12:33 i dont trust myself near edges because every time im near one i get the urge to jump off of it
the-dump 2020-10-27 23:12:40 im not suicidal my brain just does that
the-dump 2020-10-27 23:13:11 no im fine with knives, just cliffs i have an inexplicable urge to jump off of them
the-dump 2020-10-27 23:13:39 well if you believe in that sorta stuff then maybe
the-dump 2020-10-28 00:06:29 what are you doing step ladder?

general 2020-10-29 19:39:35 What
general 2020-10-29 19:39:40 Did an unde just get banned
general 2020-10-29 19:41:46 Unde bans are bans for 13 years just in case they were born today
general 2020-10-30 05:04:11 someone should be original and build a sports tank instead of boring old standard tank
general 2020-10-30 05:04:27 i can say something philosophical if you want
general 2020-10-30 05:05:26 i wonder why anime is so likeable
general 2020-10-30 05:05:41 i hate it because i dont want myself going down the shithole of anime but i admit that its easy to like
general 2020-10-30 05:05:54 but i just wonder why
general 2020-10-30 05:06:31 ah yes, its very likeable because its easy to like
general 2020-10-30 05:07:18 hmm
general 2020-10-30 05:07:39 yeah i suppose that it is indeed easier to make a magical world out of a drawing rather than out of the real world
general 2020-10-30 05:09:17 ```lua
for ass do
  give(money)
end```
general 2020-10-30 05:09:59 why
general 2020-10-30 05:11:48 i have recieved no reason as for the need of flying noob worm so therefore i shall not deliver
general 2020-10-30 07:40:17 i have a feeling that all old people know eachother
general 2020-10-30 07:40:43 like my debate teacher is somehow like 1 friend away from my mother
general 2020-10-30 07:40:55 i turned off his creativity gradient
general 2020-10-30 07:41:03 since i dont think he needs to be creative anymore
general 2020-10-30 07:41:06 its holding him back
general 2020-10-30 07:41:40 imagine a spider that hasnt gone through training
general 2020-10-30 07:42:08 because this time he wasnt supposed to learn, i was testing my new input/output thingamabober to see if he would stop goddamn dying
general 2020-10-30 07:42:23 anyways he stopped goddamn dying so i turned off his creativity gradient to see what happens
general 2020-10-30 07:42:32 since the creativity gradient was there simply to stop him from dying
general 2020-10-30 07:43:08 i like the blocky aesthetic
general 2020-10-30 07:43:20 also i need to give him 2 more legs since hes not quite a full spider yet
general 2020-10-30 07:43:26 hes an insect right now
general 2020-10-30 07:43:51 also once he has 8 legs im going to strap a throne to him for me to sit on
general 2020-10-30 07:47:30 roblock
general 2020-10-30 07:47:37 my gamer days are behind me
general 2020-10-30 07:47:48 my future is full of robo bitches to be made
general 2020-10-30 07:48:14 i will make giant enemy spiders except in real life and take over the US government and abolish the middle class
general 2020-10-30 07:48:48 no voting required
general 2020-10-30 07:49:30 though if you want to as a last hope for freedom as my giant enemy spider robots crawl over your house and attempt to break in to take you to brazil then be my guest
general 2020-10-30 07:57:50 eye disease
general 2020-10-30 17:55:02 bruh this is a discord for virtual lego building
general 2020-10-30 17:55:05 calm down please
general 2020-10-30 21:08:06 welp
general 2020-10-30 21:08:20 its that time of the year where mid day looks like a sunset
general 2020-10-30 21:08:39 i forgot what is 24 c
general 2020-10-30 21:08:49 wtf
general 2020-10-30 21:09:04 75 degrees fahrenheit
general 2020-10-30 21:09:07 thats warm wtf
general 2020-10-30 21:09:16 who is saying 25C is cold
general 2020-10-30 21:09:38 shinji lives in the sahara apparently
general 2020-10-30 21:10:36 damn but politics are fun, watch
general 2020-10-30 21:10:57 i cant think of anything political right now
general 2020-10-31 04:43:27 mm chees
general 2020-10-31 04:43:46 everybody knows about cheddar cheese
general 2020-10-31 04:43:48 but damn
general 2020-10-31 04:44:08 the actual real stuff that isnt dyed orange tastes amazing
general 2020-10-31 04:44:38 has protein crystals in it and stuff
general 2020-10-31 05:10:41 i love fucking with desmos
general 2020-10-31 05:11:05 math
general 2020-10-31 05:19:35 spooky
general 2020-10-31 05:20:38 there needs to be a version of desmos that runs on your GPU so that you can get more detail
general 2020-10-31 05:21:26 yes but heres the real question
general 2020-10-31 05:21:32 the limit as it approaches *where*
general 2020-10-31 05:21:49 it doesnt exist at 0
general 2020-10-31 05:21:53 undefined
general 2020-10-31 07:47:11 maybe i should train the giant enemy spider to walk before i train the giant enemy spider to chase things
general 2020-10-31 08:10:05 lmao i found out why the giant enemy spider has been having issues learning how to walk and going towards the goal
general 2020-10-31 08:10:19 roblox physics objects are garbage
general 2020-10-31 08:11:15 i was confused why it was having such a hard time learning to walk when it was clearly learning how to stand up, but then i turned off his brain and he was still flailing around so i realized that the physics objects are garbage
general 2020-10-31 08:11:21 he was trying to learn, but couldnt
general 2020-10-31 08:11:44 so now im switching tor motor6Ds in hopes that those work like actually useable objects
general 2020-10-31 08:40:43 wait, are you making randomly generated maps?
general 2020-10-31 20:15:01 ay i suggest *not* going trick or treating today
general 2020-10-31 20:20:36 in leaf gang we're racist towards the french, except only 3 specific french. the other ones are cool
general 2020-10-31 20:20:47 they blew up our minecraft house
general 2020-10-31 20:20:55 lucien, derpy, and zach
general 2020-10-31 20:21:01 they're terrorists
general 2020-10-31 20:21:07 they blew up our minecraft houses
general 2020-10-31 22:13:38 i hope that some day humanity blows up a mountain for the hell of it
general 2020-10-31 22:13:44 
general 2020-10-31 22:13:45 like this
general 2020-11-01 04:21:22 I can change how a stimulus affects the giant enemy spider's brain in real time
general 2020-11-01 04:22:09 imagine god reached into your brain and turned off your instinct to take a shit
general 2020-11-01 04:22:13 thats how powerful i am
general 2020-11-01 05:23:33 the smaller the plane, the harder it is to fly

general 2020-11-03 08:15:01 behold, welcome to the day of immense entertainment
general 2020-11-03 08:22:13 today will be very entertaining
general 2020-11-03 08:22:28 only happens once every 4 years, so gotta sit back and enjoy it
general 2020-11-03 08:22:46 this one in particular will be very entertaining, one of the most entertaining in fact
general 2020-11-03 08:23:02 ?
general 2020-11-03 08:23:06 its november 3rd
general 2020-11-03 08:23:12 aka
general 2020-11-03 08:23:18 united states presidential election day!
general 2020-11-03 08:24:16 covid would prefer the united states didnt do an election this year but this is no time for politics
general 2020-11-04 02:54:52 hmm
general 2020-11-04 02:54:57 this chat isnt political enough
general 2020-11-04 02:55:07 its political day goddamn it
general 2020-11-04 02:55:14 happens only once every 4 years
general 2020-11-04 02:55:18 appreciate it
general 2020-11-04 02:55:32 obama
general 2020-11-04 02:55:33 is going to win
general 2020-11-04 03:00:03 obama last name reveal? O_O
general 2020-11-04 03:12:53 we should sell florida
general 2020-11-04 03:13:42 me
general 2020-11-04 03:13:58 roblox hq land
general 2020-11-04 08:17:09 hmm
general 2020-11-04 08:17:29 shall i say something political, philosophical, or something about my spider
general 2020-11-04 08:17:43 aight
general 2020-11-04 08:17:43 political
general 2020-11-04 08:17:58 trump is going to try to invalidate something like 2 million ballots
general 2020-11-04 08:18:06 political done
general 2020-11-04 08:18:08 now what
general 2020-11-04 08:18:10 oh hi rick
general 2020-11-04 08:18:31 aight next on the list
general 2020-11-04 08:18:38 philosophical
general 2020-11-04 08:18:40 hmm
general 2020-11-04 08:18:58 trump has less of a chance the win the longer that votes are counted
general 2020-11-04 08:19:09 i feel like im forgetting something
general 2020-11-05 09:08:30 i just noticed that my cat has eyebrows
general 2020-11-05 09:08:36 i think that means hes getting a little old
general 2020-11-05 09:08:55 cant be bothered
general 2020-11-05 09:09:03 because i would have to turn on the light
general 2020-11-05 09:09:05 get my phone
general 2020-11-05 09:09:12 basically its just a slightly old looking cat
general 2020-11-05 09:09:28 hes a good one though
general 2020-11-05 09:09:39 though he bullies the other animals, hes nice to humans
general 2020-11-05 09:48:20 me
general 2020-11-05 09:48:23 but i wont get one
general 2020-11-05 09:48:38 everybody wants a free rtx 3080 tf you mean
general 2020-11-05 10:27:41 i added a neuron activation visualizer to my spider bot so i can see whats going on so i can improve the learning algorithm https://gyazo.com/798e0a08b5525845bcc4deea74d75726
general 2020-11-05 10:27:59 the squares on the left are the neuron activations, red is negative, green is positive
general 2020-11-05 10:28:09 it seems to be flickering between 2 values a lot of the time
general 2020-11-05 10:28:32 yes indeedie
general 2020-11-05 10:28:43 well, the brain isnt very deep, only 4 hidden layers
general 2020-11-05 10:28:55 because roblox is the only place i know how to program
general 2020-11-05 10:29:08 also its a 3d workspace, so it makes it convenient for my spider bots
general 2020-11-05 10:29:31 i know how to use python, and its super easy to learn other languages
general 2020-11-05 10:29:43 but i just dont know how to program on the actual computer
general 2020-11-05 10:29:50 besides, roblox provides most of what i need
general 2020-11-05 10:29:57 access to the GPU would be kinda nice though
general 2020-11-05 10:30:29 i've heard of Godot
general 2020-11-05 10:30:41 a machine learning project that i sort of help with uses it
general 2020-11-05 10:30:47 help with as in i help with theory
general 2020-11-05 10:31:07 well, i dont help very much very often, but i throw ideas in and sometimes people take them
general 2020-11-05 10:31:48 i already know how to use roblox
general 2020-11-05 10:32:04 im sort of stubborn like that
general 2020-11-05 10:32:08 has its positives and negatives
general 2020-11-05 10:32:26 if i wasnt this stubborn i wouldnt have kept working on AI for so long
general 2020-11-05 10:32:38 but, i cant be bothered to use better things
general 2020-11-05 10:34:34 dont fail next time noob
general 2020-11-05 10:42:46 the giant enemy spider just went through its first training run, and its neuron activations do indeed look like they are changing more(which is what i want, since i added a thing to the learning algorithm that made their weights favor neurons that changed more) https://gyazo.com/67f60efac142e551b6538cb539a0f484
general 2020-11-05 10:45:02 i plan to
general 2020-11-05 10:45:04 actually
general 2020-11-05 10:45:22 just need to get it to work and learn first though
the-dump 2020-11-06 01:07:25 
general 2020-11-06 01:33:18 booyah
general 2020-11-06 01:33:31 my fix works, now the spiders brain doesnt die nearly as often
general 2020-11-06 01:33:55 and i fixed my fix so that its more likely to strengthen connections to memory nodes
general 2020-11-06 01:34:04 so now the brain should die a lot less often
general 2020-11-06 01:34:07 this is going to be epic
general 2020-11-06 02:10:00 the giant enemy spider do be grooving https://gyazo.com/634893e9f0c50688e4674de955decf0f
general 2020-11-06 02:10:28 those are his neuron activations
general 2020-11-06 02:10:42 green is positive, red is negative
general 2020-11-06 08:28:09 ai is so dumb
general 2020-11-06 08:28:27 you cant just smack some nodes in there and expect it to do shit
general 2020-11-06 08:28:39 you have to give the architecture some thought
general 2020-11-06 08:28:44 and that angers me
general 2020-11-06 08:48:57 bruh how tf do i invent a human
general 2020-11-06 08:49:47 <@!221487880487436288> im asking about a human, not a person who
general 2020-11-06 08:49:48 uh
general 2020-11-06 08:49:54 i cant think of anybody to insult
general 2020-11-06 08:50:00 trump supporters
general 2020-11-06 08:50:03 or biden supporters
general 2020-11-06 08:50:07 one of the two
general 2020-11-06 08:57:13 roblox is also working on multi threading
general 2020-11-06 08:57:26 its where theres multiple threads
general 2020-11-06 10:11:53 yoooo georgia is blue
general 2020-11-06 10:11:59 what a meme and a half
the-dump 2020-11-07 00:14:10 what the fuck
the-dump 2020-11-07 00:14:19 why does tea+pizza taste like peanut butter
general 2020-11-07 01:11:14 aight, if the giant enemy spider doesnt start walking or doing something interesting by the time i wake up tomorrow, im going to change his brain architecture to something that actually makes sense
general 2020-11-07 03:36:42 how can cats look so adorable while theyre beating the fuck out of a poor mouse
general 2020-11-07 03:36:52 not even killing it
general 2020-11-07 03:36:57 just slapping it until it stops moving
general 2020-11-07 03:37:00 ew
general 2020-11-07 03:38:51 my politics days are behind me. the dorito is gone. i have done what i needed to do
general 2020-11-07 04:27:16 woah
general 2020-11-07 04:29:30 magnets should affect other creations
general 2020-11-07 04:29:50 in pvp mode*
general 2020-11-08 03:03:07 i shall make my robots creative, and then patent creativity
general 2020-11-08 03:03:16 therefore you are not allowed to be creative without paying me money
general 2020-11-08 03:03:58 good luck with making an alternative to creativity
general 2020-11-08 03:05:14 mm
general 2020-11-08 03:05:17 makes sense
general 2020-11-08 03:05:22 fucking up so bad that you invent something cool
general 2020-11-08 03:06:31 thats how i invented the warp drive
general 2020-11-08 03:07:17 i put like 5 pistons on eachother for some reason and a magnet and i made a really weird version of the warp drive
general 2020-11-08 03:08:37 no clue
general 2020-11-08 08:43:02 word
general 2020-11-08 10:02:27 if you can show me any AI programmer who doesnt aspire to someday take over the world with AI then i will pay you 100 robux
general 2020-11-08 10:03:22 elon musk doesnt program ai, he pays people to program ai
general 2020-11-08 10:03:32 hes just like "aaAA ai *spooky*"
general 2020-11-08 10:04:09 <@!289930922655088640> tesla is dead
general 2020-11-08 10:04:13 he died like 100 years ago
general 2020-11-08 10:04:44 i know
general 2020-11-08 10:04:47 word play >:(
general 2020-11-08 10:11:46 i like how in the fan dub of sonic Adventure 2, the lore is that egg man loses his wife to an edgy hedgehog and he gets so bad that he eventually blows up the moon by pissing on it
general 2020-11-08 10:12:16 hmm something philosophical
general 2020-11-08 10:12:18 mm
general 2020-11-08 10:12:27 i cant think of something philosophical on the spot
general 2020-11-08 10:13:06 but i've thought too much about how we feel things and now when i think about it, the sensation of feeling something just feels like weird fuzziness
general 2020-11-08 10:13:16 its hard to describe but it fucks me up
general 2020-11-08 10:13:28 because you dont actually feel the location its just fucking weird
general 2020-11-08 10:13:57 anyways its 2 am so its time for me to finish my giant enemy spider rewrite
general 2020-11-08 10:14:37 <@!484529511468236802> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAoDgCF-feg
general 2020-11-08 10:51:48 i've upgraded the giant enemy spider to use its new brain architecture
general 2020-11-08 10:52:12 im not expecting much, ill probably have to add a learner brain segment for things to get *really* interesting
general 2020-11-08 10:52:36 wait, whats going on?
general 2020-11-08 10:53:10 how so?
general 2020-11-08 10:53:36 thats dumb
general 2020-11-08 10:53:46 i would never play roblox at school, thats just asking to be bullied
general 2020-11-08 19:51:39 Alphabet soup
general 2020-11-08 19:54:09 The giant enemy spider seems to accidentally take a step every minute
general 2020-11-08 19:54:23 So after like 40 minutes he's pretty far from the camera
general 2020-11-09 02:14:56 i got 100% in pregnancy test
general 2020-11-09 02:15:13 beat that idiot
general 2020-11-09 02:15:45 yeah well i passed my iq test B)
general 2020-11-09 02:15:57 i have now graduated
general 2020-11-09 02:16:17 wtf why is the world sideways
general 2020-11-09 02:16:23 oh nvm its back to normal
general 2020-11-09 02:16:45 undr werent you banned like a year ago
general 2020-11-09 03:15:05 i feel bad for my sister because shes so short
general 2020-11-09 03:16:02 she likes to bake things but all the spices are on the high shelves so she either tells me to get it for her or has to get a chair and she doesnt like to admit that shes short so she usually just gets the chair unless she has some way to disguise her asking me to get it for her
general 2020-11-09 03:17:21 nope
general 2020-11-09 03:18:02 <@!719027941647974431> girls arent real
general 2020-11-09 03:18:05 so shush
general 2020-11-09 03:18:59 i've never seen a woman on the internet that hasnt turned out to actually be a dude
general 2020-11-09 03:19:56 girls were created by bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms
general 2020-11-09 03:20:17 ay now dont actually start getting toxic
general 2020-11-09 03:20:30 its just a joke people, dont take it too far
general 2020-11-09 03:20:47 bruh
general 2020-11-09 06:24:27 my teammate in a game was an exploiter so i destroyed our spawn, killed him, and then killed myself
general 2020-11-09 06:24:36 the enemy team won
general 2020-11-09 06:24:57 OH also the best part is the exploiter was playing that game for about 3 hours at that point, so i just ruined it for him
general 2020-11-09 06:25:12 especially since we were literally 11 seconds away from winning
general 2020-11-09 06:25:18 i just destroyed the beacon and then shot him
general 2020-11-09 09:13:56 hmm
general 2020-11-09 09:14:03 moustache november
general 2020-11-09 09:14:08 might as well
general 2020-11-09 09:25:58 the giant enemy spider's new brain architecture has definitely effected the way it acts
general 2020-11-09 09:26:09 it has different brain segments now rather than just one giant block of neurons
general 2020-11-09 09:26:21 input processing, memory processing, muscle processing
general 2020-11-09 09:27:00 im planning for an auxiliary network that learns to coach the main brain in training
general 2020-11-09 09:27:54 or if i want to make it sound like im creating skynet
general 2020-11-09 09:28:06 im creating a neural network that trains itself
general 2020-11-09 10:20:39 OH i just remembered what i was forgetting
general 2020-11-09 10:22:48 how about they add the free robux no scam 100% guaranteed button
general 2020-11-09 10:43:38 we need jeus
general 2020-11-09 11:21:05 hacker mans
general 2020-11-09 11:21:42 i personally liked math
general 2020-11-09 11:22:03 im using the math that my calculus teacher taught me to make a giant enemy spider
general 2020-11-09 11:22:22 probably <#507673335816126509>
general 2020-11-09 11:23:05 owls and cats are suspiciously similar
general 2020-11-09 11:23:59 i thought it sucked being a senior graduating in 2020
general 2020-11-09 11:24:00 but damn
general 2020-11-09 11:24:08 imagine being a senior this year
general 2020-11-09 11:24:25 at least i got to build planes and stuff for the first semester
general 2020-11-09 11:24:51 fuck no
general 2020-11-09 11:24:53 math is easy
general 2020-11-09 11:24:59 its just making numbers do things
general 2020-11-09 11:25:24 lmao
general 2020-11-09 11:25:40 we had a calculator for the entirety of calculus and trust me it isnt easier with it
general 2020-11-09 11:25:54 well, its easier in the sense that you dont have to write everything down
general 2020-11-09 11:26:12 but calculus is all about theory and weird stuff
general 2020-11-09 11:27:37 yeah, i think the learner network will help the giant enemy spider quite a bit
general 2020-11-09 11:27:49 if it works the way i design it to
general 2020-11-09 11:29:11 https://gyazo.com/4514a0d13db0fd3780f27604b62b5a77
general 2020-11-09 11:29:15 hes doign push ups
general 2020-11-09 11:29:58 not just any spooder
general 2020-11-09 11:30:01 the giant enemy spooder
general 2020-11-09 11:30:08 except hes not an enemy
general 2020-11-09 11:30:12 hUh
general 2020-11-09 11:30:17 sort of
general 2020-11-09 11:30:28 still figuring a lot of things out
general 2020-11-09 11:30:40 my learning algorithm takes a lot more theory than others
general 2020-11-09 11:30:53 thats actually what im trying to do
general 2020-11-09 11:31:12 none
general 2020-11-09 11:31:18 its just one brain figuring stuff out
general 2020-11-09 11:31:58 well, i might give the giant enemy spider a friend, to see if making them social will allow them to learn
general 2020-11-09 11:32:01 you can do that?
general 2020-11-09 11:32:03 since when
general 2020-11-09 11:32:07 oh
general 2020-11-09 11:32:41 well hes linked with heartbeat, so he thinks every time the server has a heartbeat
general 2020-11-09 11:32:53 speeding up physics wont make him learn faster
general 2020-11-09 11:33:28 well, i would make multiple, but i dont see how it would help. they arent competing, they're just trying to figure things out on their own
general 2020-11-09 11:33:42 thats evolution
general 2020-11-09 11:33:59 i dont want to do evolution, i want to see if i can get a single brain to figure things out
general 2020-11-09 11:34:16 <@!722506071733960794> yes
general 2020-11-09 11:34:37 but yeah, cloning the spider and making them compete against eachother is the simplest way to make it learn
general 2020-11-09 11:34:57 but im trying to get it to continuously learn, sort of like us
general 2020-11-09 11:35:08 where i dont just randomly throw numbers in and see what happens
general 2020-11-09 11:35:15 but rather intelligently design the learning
general 2020-11-09 11:35:27 yes
general 2020-11-09 11:35:33 i've always loved a challenge
general 2020-11-09 11:36:00 what do you mean by that
general 2020-11-09 11:36:26 it doesnt know how to stand up
general 2020-11-09 11:36:41 and i would have to store stuff and things
general 2020-11-09 11:36:56 besides, the way the body is designed it naturally stands up
general 2020-11-09 11:37:06 its complicated
general 2020-11-09 11:37:15 i use hebbian learning, similar to what actual brains use
general 2020-11-09 11:37:49 it collects neuron activations, and the scores that the spider got at the time of those activations, and uses that to learn what it did right and what it did wrong
general 2020-11-09 11:38:38 right now im just letting the base brain learn based on my hand-crafted evaluation for the spider, but tomorrow or something i will give it a network that will do the learning for me
general 2020-11-09 11:38:49 i actually made a diagram of the spider's current brain if you're interested
general 2020-11-09 11:38:59 <@!722506071733960794> hard to tell
general 2020-11-09 11:39:12 
general 2020-11-09 11:39:18 this is the brain architecture
general 2020-11-09 11:39:35 its just the architecture, doesnt have any of the info about how it learns and stuff
general 2020-11-09 11:39:43 ???
general 2020-11-09 11:39:54 maybe some day
general 2020-11-09 11:40:34 well, im making a spider in roblox
general 2020-11-09 11:40:41 i thought you meant a physical in real life spider
general 2020-11-09 11:41:04 the diagram is just for me to visualize the architecture of the brain of the spider
general 2020-11-09 11:41:32 how so?
general 2020-11-09 11:42:12 neural networks are pretty complicated things, especially systems of networks
general 2020-11-09 11:42:17 thats why i made the diagram
general 2020-11-09 11:42:25 so that i dont have to memorize it all
general 2020-11-09 11:43:04 i guess
general 2020-11-09 11:43:35 im going to probably start drawing up the learning auxiliary network's architecture tomorrow
general 2020-11-09 11:43:54 thanks
general 2020-11-09 11:44:14 you're thanked
general 2020-11-09 11:45:20 basically its impossible for me to write a hand-crafted evaluation of the spider to perfectly cover everything
general 2020-11-09 11:45:37 so im going to make a neural network evaluate the spider's brain
general 2020-11-09 20:32:34 what is going on
general 2020-11-09 20:32:58 are there just like 4 people who keep annoying people and coming back or something
general 2020-11-10 05:02:05 shit
general 2020-11-10 05:02:09 my cat has learned to steal
general 2020-11-10 07:37:15 who knew boiling bones could make such a great soup
general 2020-11-10 07:37:35 well not by itself duh
general 2020-11-10 07:37:40 its like a base
general 2020-11-10 07:37:43 based 😳
general 2020-11-10 07:37:56 yeah
general 2020-11-10 07:38:01 wait you dont leave the bone in wtf
general 2020-11-10 07:38:16 you boil the bone for 12 hours and then take it out and you make soup with the liquid
general 2020-11-10 07:38:26 apparently dogs know what theyre doing, taking the bones
general 2020-11-10 07:38:39 12 hour soup and its 100% worth it
general 2020-11-10 07:38:55 actually it should be more like 48 hour soup but im not *that* patient
general 2020-11-10 07:39:11 bones dont have liquid you noobs
general 2020-11-10 07:39:23 you boil the bones in water and the water dissolves all the nice bone flavors
general 2020-11-10 07:39:45 its hard to describe the flavor of the base that boiling bones makes
general 2020-11-10 07:39:49 imagine bones but wet
general 2020-11-10 07:39:54 thats the best description i can give
general 2020-11-10 07:40:25 ?
general 2020-11-10 07:40:31 i dont have any clue what i said
general 2020-11-10 07:40:53 Burger McKing
general 2020-11-10 07:56:50 soupular
general 2020-11-10 07:58:50 man wtf
general 2020-11-10 07:58:55 why is it snowing

general 2020-11-10 11:40:59 man
general 2020-11-10 11:41:43 i want to do the ai stuff and things and give it a network that determines what it should learn but i dont wanna have to do the binary and shit
general 2020-11-10 21:42:50 why tf do computers need cases?
general 2020-11-10 21:43:08 just lay the hardware out across the table and make sure your cat doesnt sit on it and boom
the-dump 2020-11-10 21:45:13 hmm ooga booga

general 2020-11-12 02:52:55 man
general 2020-11-12 02:53:01 why do bugs taste good when they're wet
general 2020-11-12 02:53:10 crabs
general 2020-11-12 02:53:11 lobsters
general 2020-11-12 02:53:25 what other sea bugs
general 2020-11-12 02:53:36 do snails count as bugs?
general 2020-11-12 02:53:49 yes it is
general 2020-11-12 02:54:12 a spider is inarguably a bug
general 2020-11-12 02:54:27 a crab is like a big spider with claws and in the ocean
general 2020-11-12 02:54:36 and spiders are arachnids
general 2020-11-12 02:54:39 wahts your point
general 2020-11-12 02:55:24 bruh <@456226577798135808> bugs are arthropods
general 2020-11-12 02:55:28 thats their scientific name
general 2020-11-12 02:55:33 lobsters and crabs ar earthropods
general 2020-11-12 02:55:51 yes, and spiders are arachnids
general 2020-11-12 02:56:00 anyways back to my question
general 2020-11-12 02:56:06 why do bugs taste good when wet
general 2020-11-12 02:56:28 makes sense
general 2020-11-12 02:56:40 <@!738702049113538600> thats called a crab
general 2020-11-12 02:56:51 i dont think theres a wet cockroach
general 2020-11-12 02:57:10 pinchy things do taste good
general 2020-11-12 04:33:23 the force is strong with this one
general 2020-11-12 05:57:55 the best thing about elementary school is the field trips
general 2020-11-12 05:58:08 after elementary school field trips dont exist anymore
general 2020-11-12 05:58:36 damn
general 2020-11-12 05:58:43 i havent been on a field trip in 6 years
general 2020-11-12 06:01:18 well, if you go into debate you get to go on sort of field trips
general 2020-11-12 06:01:36 though thats teh same with a lot of classes that are linked to clubs
general 2020-11-12 06:02:07 debate was fun except for the part where you wake up at 6am and go home at 12pm for 2 days in a row
general 2020-11-12 07:35:40 im designing a sort of perpetual hell for annoying people in my game where i just send them
general 2020-11-12 07:36:22 where its just never ending obbies and we tell them "yeah its just a really really long obby, you have to get to the end to get out" and they cant ever escape
general 2020-11-12 07:37:17 outsmart what
general 2020-11-12 07:37:52 also having your first project be a learning ai seems a bit of a bad idea
general 2020-11-12 07:38:09 i mean saying that makes me a hypocrite but yeah
general 2020-11-12 07:38:35 also AIs are hard to train, i dont know how you would make it do super advanced obbies
general 2020-11-12 07:38:58 like wall hops and stuff
general 2020-11-12 08:29:04 i spoke to a friend that i havent spoken to in 6 months
general 2020-11-12 08:29:36 he revealed his grand plan of taking over the canadian government and invading the US to restore the true american values by enslaving the communists and socialists
general 2020-11-12 08:29:56 and i revealed my plan to build an army of giant enemy spiders and overthrow the government
general 2020-11-12 08:30:03 so yeah
general 2020-11-12 08:30:10 the bro love is still there
general 2020-11-12 08:31:10 sounds good, idk who synth is but if he got banned from here then he probably deserved it
general 2020-11-12 08:31:55 ay im just goin off of the data that i have
general 2020-11-12 08:32:00 the mods here are cool
general 2020-11-12 08:32:11 if you got banned permanently without appeal you probably did something worthy of it
general 2020-11-12 08:32:29 the bunny man?
general 2020-11-12 08:32:37 i didnt know the bunny man had it in him
general 2020-11-12 09:14:40 im running folding@home on my computer and my cpu just got a really cool project
general 2020-11-12 09:15:36 scientists are simulating extremophile bacteria's proteins to see how it works but mutating the proteins a little bit to see how each mutation effects efficiency of the protein
general 2020-11-12 09:16:10 i wonder what their goal is. maybe its to design a more efficient extremophile bacteria. or just to understand extremophile bacteria more
general 2020-11-12 09:16:12 yeah
general 2020-11-12 09:16:42 this is what the protein looks like https://gyazo.com/e4e2b00622517cc81214f65baa8b1fe4
general 2020-11-12 09:17:34 my gpu is running a larger protein that is simulating a covid19 protein and its responses to several chemicals in hopes to find treatments for covid19
general 2020-11-12 09:22:38 nah nah its not chernobyl its a different horror movie trope
general 2020-11-12 09:22:45 its from an acid lake in antarctica
general 2020-11-12 09:23:07 also <@!347182144873037824> i myself arent doing this alone
general 2020-11-12 09:23:23 i downloaded a program called folding@home where it basically donates my computer's computing power to scientists
general 2020-11-12 09:23:50 the program scales the computing power depending on how much you use, so its only using what you arent using
general 2020-11-12 09:24:38 im currently the 45,771st most donated guy
general 2020-11-12 09:24:54 theres a lot of people who have downloaded it, i recommend you use it
general 2020-11-12 09:27:46 we get a covid19 cure faster
general 2020-11-12 09:27:52 not a vaccine, those operate differently
general 2020-11-12 09:28:03 but you get one that kills the virus while its inside your body
general 2020-11-12 09:31:58 i in fact did not
general 2020-11-12 09:32:06 if you knew how vaccines worked
general 2020-11-12 09:32:35 a vaccine trains your immune system to kill the virus
general 2020-11-12 09:32:51 aka makes you not get it in the first place and less severe
general 2020-11-12 09:32:58 a cure on the other hand actually directly kills the virus
general 2020-11-12 09:33:10 sorry for being slightly vague
general 2020-11-12 09:33:28 have fun drinking hand sanitizer

general 2020-11-13 10:22:35 roblox is going to add multithreading soon
general 2020-11-13 10:22:48 which is going to be super useful for everybody, especially the giant enemy spider
general 2020-11-13 10:23:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAoDgCF-feg
general 2020-11-13 10:25:21 they may have, but the difference here is that somebody actually got access to it
general 2020-11-13 10:26:43 man how cool do you have to be to get your character turned into an anime girl without your consent
general 2020-11-13 10:27:39 some guy went looking for it in some recent version of studio after something was said about it and he found the code for it and almost crashed his computer because he ran it on all of his threads
general 2020-11-13 10:29:06 
general 2020-11-13 10:29:08 yep
general 2020-11-13 10:29:45 i wonder what the API for multithreading is gonna look like
general 2020-11-13 10:31:22 i think getting a sort of programming language for plane crazy would be cool but rickje doesnt think so :(
general 2020-11-13 10:32:37 you could build laser guided missiles and computers and stuff with a programming language
general 2020-11-13 10:33:45 seems like it
general 2020-11-13 10:33:59 luaU is going to replace normal roblox lua, right?
general 2020-11-13 10:34:02 or am i mistaken
general 2020-11-13 10:34:24 its what luaU is, its roblox's version of lua
general 2020-11-13 10:34:47 i dont think it would require you to rewrite the game
general 2020-11-13 10:34:55 luaU is just the backend of lua
general 2020-11-13 10:35:04 the scripting would stay the same i imagine
general 2020-11-13 10:36:06 ill ask my friend because hes a goddamn nerd and follows all roblox development like a kpop stan follows some korean singer guy around
general 2020-11-13 10:37:09 no, but he reads all of roblox's blogs about updates, and he has some friends who do that sorta stuff
general 2020-11-13 10:38:05 yeah he comes in handy
general 2020-11-13 10:38:09 i appreciate his knowledge
general 2020-11-13 10:38:41 i thought for a second you said madattak made a love letter
general 2020-11-13 10:39:15 probably 1 or something
general 2020-11-13 10:40:00 spinning things are the most fun thing to mess with
general 2020-11-13 10:40:22 they allow for stationary super high speeds so you can contain your experiments to spawn where you can cause mayhem
general 2020-11-13 10:41:58 rays have always been rays
general 2020-11-13 10:42:02 lines are rays that end
general 2020-11-13 10:42:08 rays go *forever*
general 2020-11-13 10:42:25 math wording <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
general 2020-11-13 10:42:57 rip
general 2020-11-13 10:43:15 theres a thing on windows that always records your screen but deletes it after 5 minutes
general 2020-11-13 10:43:27 useful for when somebody is exploiting but you arent recording
general 2020-11-13 10:44:49 i kind of like writing stories but i've never finished writing one
general 2020-11-13 10:45:04 always got distracted with my programming projects
general 2020-11-13 10:45:33 hmm.
general 2020-11-13 10:45:47 yeah why *do* hovers lag so much
general 2020-11-13 10:46:07 its just casting a ray in the direction of the hover and then adding a force to the hover if it detects something
general 2020-11-13 10:46:43 more or less thrust depending on distance from point intersection  to thruster
general 2020-11-13 10:47:11 that shouldnt be that computationally expensive unless i dont know something that it has to do
general 2020-11-13 10:47:37 what are conv drives
general 2020-11-13 10:49:01 i was wondering the same thing but i've never used hover thrusters so i have no idea how they work
general 2020-11-13 10:49:36 anyways do you guys have any clue how dramatic the chess engine community is
general 2020-11-13 10:49:49 its so... surreal?(im not a wordologist)
general 2020-11-13 10:50:12 basically people try to make the most powerful chess engine possible, and its basically like football but for nerds
general 2020-11-13 10:50:40 you've got different people rooting for different engines and everyone gets super dramatic especially when one engine does somewhat better than the others
general 2020-11-13 10:50:53 i never expected the chess community to have so much drama
general 2020-11-13 11:15:46 retro, if they bailed out then they would have been captured for surrendering
general 2020-11-13 11:15:57 and to japan in those times, surrendering was worse than death
general 2020-11-13 11:16:06 they prefered to die
general 2020-11-13 11:16:37 suffering is better than dying
general 2020-11-13 11:16:41 suffering is just a stimulus
general 2020-11-13 11:17:01 dying means you lose any opportunities left
general 2020-11-13 11:17:10 suffering means theres still a chance for things to get better

general 2020-11-13 11:37:48 so yeah who asked for the flying cheese
general 2020-11-13 11:38:12 np
general 2020-11-13 11:39:11 the cheese is stable when its at high speeds but hard to control at low speeds

creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:53:03 no rules against shitposting as far as i can tell
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:54:38 it took more effort than you would expect to get that cheese to fly, so im not breaking the "low effort" rule
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:56:30 i will defend myself if it comes to that
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:59:32 well if thats how they see it then so be it, not like i use <#384025409945337856> ever anyways
creations-chat 2020-11-13 12:01:13 i could become a mod if i wanted to, i've just never filled out an application

general 2020-11-14 00:23:43 who are unethical felines O_O
general 2020-11-14 00:25:43 the main problem with the cheese is that its pretty aerodynamically unstable
general 2020-11-14 00:25:51 so it changes flight diretion quite quickly
general 2020-11-14 02:34:02 i had a dream where everybody got super angry at me because i pet my cat backwards

general 2020-11-18 09:35:43 i was head of the "Peoples Republican Party" which controlled half the classroom and our ideology was communism and when it was time to vote for head of the chamber, me and the Naci(take a fat guess what that is) party's candidate tied 3 times before the teacher broke the tie by deciding that Nacis are better than Communists
general 2020-11-18 09:36:22 yeah when i take over the government im going to send the teacher to the gulag

general 2020-11-20 18:16:23 data science is like quantum mechanics. each individual data point should be in their own universe, and if you look at them then they kind of go into your brain and realize other universes exist and if you're weak it fucks everything up and ruins it

general 2020-11-22 12:18:11 because of big eyes and small nose
general 2020-11-22 12:18:13 aka baby
general 2020-11-22 12:18:17 humans are simps for babies
general 2020-11-22 12:18:41 you could give two shits about a dog or a cat though
general 2020-11-22 12:18:57 for the exact same reason you biologically would care about a baby
general 2020-11-22 12:19:05 we all hate babies, they stink and are gross
general 2020-11-22 12:19:19 but our instincts are "ooh, big eyes and small nose, protect the creature"
general 2020-11-22 12:19:26 precisely why anime is popular
general 2020-11-22 12:19:35 thats not my point
general 2020-11-22 12:19:54 bruh look at your fucking pfp
general 2020-11-22 12:19:57 baby face
general 2020-11-22 12:20:29 well whether you acknowledge it or not, thats the reason
general 2020-11-22 12:20:35 yes
general 2020-11-22 12:20:45 also no mario has a moustache and a huge nose
general 2020-11-22 12:20:50 anime doesnt have plot
general 2020-11-22 12:20:53 well, sometimes it does
general 2020-11-22 12:21:00 yes
general 2020-11-22 12:21:22 cant remember, watched them like 3 years ago
general 2020-11-22 12:21:29 and never cared enough to remember the name
general 2020-11-22 12:22:02 idk
general 2020-11-22 12:22:07 also i think thats luigi
general 2020-11-22 12:22:16 oh
general 2020-11-22 12:23:30 i mean i like some anime
general 2020-11-22 12:23:37 some animes are actually pretty good ill admit
general 2020-11-22 12:23:41 but most just aint for me
general 2020-11-22 12:24:22 i mean, avatar the last airbender was a really good anime
general 2020-11-22 12:24:34 like, it would even be good as not an anime
general 2020-11-22 12:25:04 bruh of course
general 2020-11-22 12:25:18 poor baby anime face pfp is missing out on avatar the last airbender
general 2020-11-22 12:25:47 why, because it has a japanese name?
general 2020-11-22 12:26:18 people who say avatar the last airbender isnt an anime are the only kind of weebs where their opinion really doesnt count
general 2020-11-22 12:26:26 other weebs can have their opinions count, sure
general 2020-11-22 12:26:50 oh
general 2020-11-22 12:27:05 if he was talking about the blue avatar then yeah obviously thats not an anime
general 2020-11-22 12:27:26 but if people say avatar the last airbender isnt an anime just because its made in america dont have valid opinions
general 2020-11-22 12:27:38 its like saying cheese isnt cheese unless its made in france
general 2020-11-22 12:27:54 anime is a style
general 2020-11-22 12:28:08 franch
general 2020-11-22 12:29:36 but yeah, in conclusion: people who say anime made in america isnt anime are mega weebs whos opinions dont count
general 2020-11-22 12:30:03 you like puppies dont you?
general 2020-11-22 12:30:21 hard to believe that
general 2020-11-22 12:30:48 well dogs are just anime but real
general 2020-11-22 12:31:00 and anime has big eyes and small nose
general 2020-11-22 12:31:02 so yeah
general 2020-11-22 12:31:25 you might like the plot idk
general 2020-11-22 12:31:30 but theres like 5 anime with good plot
general 2020-11-22 12:31:38 so you probably ran out by now
general 2020-11-22 12:31:47 i have indeedie
general 2020-11-22 12:32:02 i was a weeb like 3 years ago actually
general 2020-11-22 12:32:18 but i just stopped watching anime because i realized there was better stuff
general 2020-11-22 12:33:10 noses are ugly
general 2020-11-22 12:33:12 thats why
general 2020-11-22 12:33:36 and huge eyes because the whole baby instinct thing thinking huge eyes are cute
general 2020-11-22 12:33:43 yeah
general 2020-11-22 12:33:54 YIKES
general 2020-11-22 12:34:08 that can be easily misinterpreted
general 2020-11-22 12:34:25 true
general 2020-11-22 12:34:50 my friend watches naruto and he says any black people always turn out to be evil
general 2020-11-22 12:35:31 japan at its finest
general 2020-11-22 12:35:46 but i did watch an anime recently which i really, really liked
general 2020-11-22 12:35:51 anime styled movie rather
general 2020-11-22 12:35:54 called a silent voice
general 2020-11-22 12:36:04 was pretty good and only painful for the first 10 minutes
general 2020-11-22 12:36:31 things got happy at the end though
general 2020-11-22 12:36:37 as expected
general 2020-11-22 12:37:06 but that one scene always gets me still
general 2020-11-22 12:37:11 infinity war wasnt an anime but yeah
general 2020-11-22 12:37:34 anime isnt THAT broad of a term
general 2020-11-22 12:37:38 theres a line drawn somewhere
general 2020-11-22 12:38:30 cats are pretty cool. they just sit there until you pet them
general 2020-11-22 12:39:03 cats seem like highly evolved squirrels except they arent rodents so i have no idea what they evolved from

general 2020-11-22 12:42:28 the moderators are kinda just noobs
general 2020-11-22 12:42:37 theyve been here for like a week or 2 and mysteriously leave

general 2020-11-22 13:03:14 and guess how good life is going in new zealand
general 2020-11-22 13:03:17 they have 0 cases
general 2020-11-22 13:03:38 new zealand is a good place
general 2020-11-22 13:03:48 i wish my country banned going outside when there was 1 case :(
general 2020-11-22 13:04:01 now we have like, several million cases
general 2020-11-22 13:04:34 idk why the US cant force citizens to wear a mask if they can force their citizens to wear pants

general 2020-11-22 13:04:49 politics
general 2020-11-22 13:04:57 but yeah they do kinda suck
general 2020-11-22 13:04:59 but no more politics
general 2020-11-22 13:05:27 because doctors have agendas, they want to save as many people as possible
general 2020-11-22 13:05:29 fucking assholes
general 2020-11-22 13:05:54 sarcasm, if you couldnt tell

general 2020-11-22 13:07:08 population control is lame

general 2020-11-22 13:07:54 sure there is
general 2020-11-22 13:08:07 make people required to take a test in order to have children
general 2020-11-22 13:08:13 that way only good parents can have children
general 2020-11-22 13:08:22 makes the population happier and keeps it more under control
general 2020-11-22 13:09:13 the only unethical part about requiring a test in order to have a child is forced abortions if they illegally have a child
general 2020-11-22 13:09:32 VIRUS
general 2020-11-22 13:09:49 that too
general 2020-11-22 13:09:59 but parenting tests should still be a thing

general 2020-11-25 14:05:26 what do you think
general 2020-11-25 14:05:31 oh
general 2020-11-26 13:05:35 i fixed a bug with the giant enemy spider's training algorithm and now his brain is slowly getting more and more active
general 2020-11-26 13:05:58 hopefully soon enough his memory processor will be able to self sustain a flow of information
general 2020-11-26 13:06:16 doesnt mean he will be smart or anything, but its the first step towards getting him to actually learn to be a giant enemy spider
general 2020-11-26 13:08:05 his actual name is Stephen Spider Zero
general 2020-11-26 13:08:13 but his nickname is the Giant Enemy Spider
general 2020-11-26 13:08:50 Stephen, because i like Stephen Hawking. Spider, because Spider, and Zero, because he has Zero influence from anyone other than himself, he figures out how to be a spider by himself
general 2020-11-26 13:09:07 and his nickname is pretty accurate except for the middle part
general 2020-11-26 13:09:19 Giant Spider is far more accurate to his nature than Giant Enemy Spider
the-dump 2020-11-26 15:24:39 i thought the cube was a joke when i heard about it in "history of the entire world i guess"
the-dump 2020-11-26 15:24:50 i only found out it wasnt a joke when my brother told me about it
general 2020-11-26 15:34:55 now that the giant enemy spider's training function is fixed, his brain is getting a lot more active, after a while his memory processor should be able to self sustain a flow of information
general 2020-11-26 15:35:02 when that happens he will be able to do funky thigns
general 2020-11-26 15:35:19 nope
general 2020-11-26 15:35:38 he has to get a self sustaining flow of information first before he can figure out something complex like walking
general 2020-11-26 15:35:49 he was born 12 hours ago actually <@!538103285412921365>
general 2020-11-26 15:35:57 that would be cruel
general 2020-11-26 15:36:18 though i do intend to make him sort of like a throne
general 2020-11-26 15:36:53 he already accidentally moves his legs, he just has to figure out how to move them not so accidentally
general 2020-11-26 15:37:50 but once the flow of information kicks in, his learning processor should also figure other things out, so maybe i will be able to teach the giant enemy spider tricks like a dog
general 2020-11-26 15:38:15 nope
general 2020-11-26 15:38:25 when he is shutdown he is gone forever
general 2020-11-26 15:38:41 since i dont have a way to save him since these are just prototypes
general 2020-11-26 15:38:56 hopefully i dont make a really good one or else ill feel really bad for turning him off
general 2020-11-26 15:43:43 heres a video of the giant enemy spider currently https://gyazo.com/dbdda0be2c67a4460d19b57468d9a411

general 2020-11-26 19:09:51 the giant enemy spider almost sustained a flow of information
general 2020-11-26 19:10:09 it sustained it for about 15 think cycles but then it stopped, so its getting close, very close

general 2020-11-26 19:21:38 turkey time
general 2020-11-26 20:41:31 i think the giant enemy spider has achieved a self sustaining flow of information
general 2020-11-26 20:42:29 i didnt run the test for too long because i was worried about messing up the giant enemy spider, but for the 5 seconds that i ran the test, the giant enemy spider achieved a self sustaining flow of information

the-dump 2020-11-28 17:50:13 yeah, like maybe 1000 americans at most believe that
the-dump 2020-11-28 17:50:17 tiny minority

general 2020-11-30 15:46:06 honestly, ask anybody who has gone into AI what they most want to do and i guarantee you all of them will say "create sentient AI"
general 2020-11-30 15:46:13 and "take over the world using robots"

general 2020-11-30 15:47:01 its literally a spider

general 2020-12-19 00:54:18 the giant enemy spider's L Auxiliary net error is increasing, which is a good thing
general 2020-12-19 00:54:23 hopefully it can keep increasing
general 2020-12-19 00:55:59 always one side of the giant enemy spider's brain is less active than the other but i suppose thats to be expected

general 2020-12-19 02:25:40 i feel bad for viruses
general 2020-12-19 02:25:47 we're kinda hacking
general 2020-12-19 02:26:27 we're using computers to simulate them down to the molecule and testing a kjhlillion things against them to find what will kill them, and we can find an effective cure to a particular virus in 6 months
general 2020-12-19 17:44:37 i like how cats just keep on walking even if you're holding them in place by their tail
general 2020-12-19 17:44:41 they really just dont care

general 2020-12-19 19:21:57 oh neat
general 2020-12-20 00:15:41 yo why tf does pork taste like human
general 2020-12-20 00:16:48 no
general 2020-12-20 00:16:53 i have no idea why you would get that idea
general 2020-12-20 01:40:54 ive found that the best way to bake potatoes is to put them in the oven at 350 for so long that they burn
general 2020-12-20 01:41:28 it makes the potato taste sweet and it falls apart into chunks that are really convenient to eat
general 2020-12-20 02:24:21 does everybody experience sleep paralysis or something
general 2020-12-20 02:24:27 because i've never experienced it

general 2020-12-20 11:15:41 im hungry
general 2020-12-20 11:15:45 but not hungry enough yet
general 2020-12-20 11:15:59 burger
general 2020-12-20 11:16:23 in the US we have other people's foods but americanized
general 2020-12-20 11:19:12 america does indeed suck i can confirm
general 2020-12-20 11:19:17 but i think we're getting better
general 2020-12-20 11:22:47 i regret to inform you all that i have figured out why belle delphine is trending
general 2020-12-20 11:50:33 bruh people looking at me waking up at 2 am and saying stuff like "hey your sleep schedule is fucked" meanwhile they're going to BED at 2 am
general 2020-12-20 11:50:35 bitches
general 2020-12-20 11:51:04 my sleep schedule is strategic while theirs is because they have poor self control
the-dump 2020-12-20 14:29:25 could yall not post these image spam-inducing gifs
the-dump 2020-12-20 14:32:23 i know
general 2020-12-21 16:51:22 im in this chess engine discord for one of the two best chess engines in the world and every single day they are thinking up new ideas on how to make their chess engine better since the other chess engine is pretty close in strength and they want theirs to be stronger
general 2020-12-21 16:51:26 its honestly really cool
general 2020-12-21 16:51:45 since both engines are open source and theres no money, just competition
general 2020-12-21 16:52:05 one runs on neural networks and the other runs on smaller neural networks but a lot faster and theyre trying to figure out which is better
general 2020-12-21 16:52:14 bigger neural networks one is 100% going to win in the end though
general 2020-12-21 16:53:55 hUh
general 2020-12-21 16:54:09 i mean these chess engines can defeat any human
general 2020-12-21 16:54:47 but i doubt human brains will ever be simulated, artificial neural networks can be designed to be much more fitting for modern history
general 2020-12-21 16:55:44 oh its definitely not impossible
general 2020-12-21 16:55:50 it will happen
general 2020-12-21 16:55:57 oh you means simulating a human brain
general 2020-12-21 16:56:03 nah them shits are outdated and inefficient
general 2020-12-21 16:56:10 not worth the computing power
general 2020-12-21 16:56:35 unless we have some general AI that has been trained to love humans, so that it will try to make life as good as possible for them
general 2020-12-22 03:26:55 damn
general 2020-12-22 03:27:01 negative gradients be hitting different
general 2020-12-22 03:28:03 the giant enemy spider's brain was completely lame and inactive because i turned off negative gradients for his deviation bias. but when i turned negative gradients back on his brain immediately got more active
general 2020-12-22 03:29:09 damn i remember when 2 black girls called me racist because i asked if they were twins and i saw them like 4 years later and they told me they were twins
general 2020-12-22 03:29:10 like wtf
general 2020-12-22 10:59:08 why do people care so much about shoes
general 2020-12-22 10:59:13 there designed to do the dirty work
general 2020-12-22 10:59:53 they're* my bad

general 2020-12-23 04:35:36 im proud of myself
general 2020-12-23 04:36:14 i will feed people in exchange for their unwavering support of my totalitarian regime
general 2020-12-23 04:36:37 nah its ugly also i dont have my phone
general 2020-12-23 04:36:40 mmmmMM
general 2020-12-23 04:36:54 taking pics of food is kinda *cringe*
general 2020-12-23 04:37:03 but i do wanna flex even though its ugly as hell
general 2020-12-23 05:18:20 i managed to fit an entire chicken into a medium sized pie, by boiling everything except the white meat and then condensing that chicken extract down to be able to fit into the pie
general 2020-12-23 05:19:03 the flavor of chicken is so dense that you can get a mouth full if chicken taste in literally the thin tiny bit of goop left on your plate after youve eaten everything else
general 2020-12-23 05:19:17 though, honestly kinda overwhelming

general 2020-12-24 00:34:03 this pandemic has a bright side, since scientists and governments have figured out to put no faith in people, the scientists researching cures for diseases will get a lot more funding, potentially preventing any future pandemics
general 2020-12-24 05:49:45 i've changed from giant enemy spiders to a super simple 2d space where a dot tries to reach a goal. i call it "Stephen Dot Zero"
general 2020-12-24 05:50:00 this is how he is doing: https://gyazo.com/88660cbba2caa956b94e1fe0ec48c064
general 2020-12-24 05:50:12 stephen dot is the grey thing
general 2020-12-24 05:50:21 trying to move towards the red thing
general 2020-12-24 05:50:43 hes not doing great, but its made me realize that he needs to experiment
general 2020-12-24 05:50:56 no, if this was in plane crazy i would have put it in <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-12-24 08:47:26 lol good luck proving that hes an unde
general 2020-12-24 10:58:46 i have a computer that is 20 years old
general 2020-12-24 10:58:52 B)
general 2020-12-24 10:58:52 its called my gameboy
general 2020-12-24 13:04:13 im so proud of my dot
general 2020-12-24 13:04:15 its learning
general 2020-12-24 13:04:23 yeah
general 2020-12-24 13:04:31 Stephen Dot Zero, my little ai project
general 2020-12-24 13:04:48 for me to figure out and optimize my neural network algorithm thingy
general 2020-12-24 13:04:52 hold on lemme get a gif
general 2020-12-24 13:05:30 https://gyazo.com/1725c99c7997e9cffcb90c812b1b56b5
general 2020-12-24 13:05:36 he has figured out the up and down
general 2020-12-24 13:05:49 now he just needs to figure out the left and right
general 2020-12-24 13:06:57 if my algorithm works correctly, its left and right outputs should get more and more sensitive until the random noise that i throw in influences the action and the dot figures out that left and right is a good idea
general 2020-12-24 13:07:07 absolutely not
general 2020-12-24 13:10:21 theres probably more effective ways of making the AI accidentally figure out something cool than just putting in random noise but ill get it done eventually
general 2020-12-24 13:10:29 what piece of code do you want
general 2020-12-24 13:10:40 neural network module code, or brain management code
general 2020-12-24 13:11:12 brain management code isnt really that interesting since it doesnt do any of the funky stuff
general 2020-12-24 13:21:54 AYYYY
general 2020-12-24 13:22:02 I JUST SAW LEFT-RIGHT MOVEMENT FROM THE DOT
general 2020-12-24 13:22:10 its all working as theorized
general 2020-12-24 13:22:33 just give him like another hour and maybe he will have gotten it pretty much completely figured out

general 2020-12-29 14:58:00 i mean you have to beat them up in a loving fashion every now and again because cats like that for some reason

general 2020-12-29 14:59:39 bitches
general 2020-12-29 15:00:04 i made a warp escape system where it has to spin up for about 4 seconds and then you can press F and you get sent to the deadlands
general 2020-12-29 15:00:32 and i also build the fastest controllable machine i've ever heard of
general 2020-12-29 15:00:40 not the fastest machine, the fastes CONTROLABLE machine

general 2020-12-31 17:17:34 humans have stupid nasal systems because evolution squished our faces so that they would be flat
general 2020-12-31 17:17:41 makes me wonder if thats why pugs were invented
general 2020-12-31 17:18:02 so that humans could have a dog that could understand their suffering except like 10 times worse
general 2020-12-31 17:18:17 sure we our
general 2020-12-31 17:18:18 our noses suck
general 2020-12-31 17:18:23 except we can breathe most of the time
general 2020-12-31 17:18:46 but we made dogs that cant breathe ever so that when we cant breathe we are like "yeah, my dog understands how i feel"
general 2020-12-31 17:28:22 obc
general 2020-12-31 17:28:25 i have a question
general 2020-12-31 17:28:33 is the cheddar cheese that you eat orange
general 2020-12-31 17:29:20 i need an answer
general 2020-12-31 17:29:35 unfortunate
general 2020-12-31 17:29:37 but not uncommon
general 2020-12-31 17:30:04 you should go to trader joes or somethign and get the real cheddar cheese
general 2020-12-31 17:30:15 its not orange and it has little protein crystals in it due to it being aged
general 2020-12-31 17:30:30 it tastes similar to the orange stuff but 100 times better
general 2020-12-31 17:31:25 100 year old eggs arent actually 100 years old
general 2020-12-31 17:31:27 they just look like it
general 2020-12-31 17:31:46 they taste good if you eat the correctly
general 2020-12-31 17:31:49 or so i've heard
general 2020-12-31 17:32:10 by not munching the whole thing or by itself
general 2020-12-31 17:32:23 you eat a little bit of it with rice so you get the rotten disgusting taste of it more subtly
general 2020-12-31 17:32:39 yeah
general 2020-12-31 17:32:42 i never said i liked it
general 2020-12-31 17:32:48 but if you eat it right its more edible
general 2020-12-31 17:33:04 nah that has diseases
general 2020-12-31 17:33:07 eat the actual dog
general 2020-12-31 17:33:09 more nutritious
general 2020-12-31 17:34:41 to make sure they dont go bad
general 2020-12-31 17:34:52 they bury it in ash mixed with idk fuckin
general 2020-12-31 17:34:53 clay
general 2020-12-31 17:34:54 or something
general 2020-12-31 17:35:20 so you get the rotten taste without the potential health effects
general 2020-12-31 17:35:22 duh
general 2020-12-31 17:35:40 why do you think blue cheese exists
general 2020-12-31 17:35:49 tastes moldy but mold tastes good when mixed with cheese
general 2021-01-01 04:05:39 i wonder how peopel can dislike cats

general 2021-01-01 04:06:26 yes but what is the reasoning for that
general 2021-01-01 04:06:29 thats my question
general 2021-01-01 04:06:50 yes but im looking for HIS reasoning
general 2021-01-01 04:07:09 i assume everybodys gender
general 2021-01-01 04:07:12 cant cancel me now
general 2021-01-01 04:07:23 because i assume your gender regardless of your real gender

general 2021-01-01 04:41:17 yeah

general 2021-01-07 02:39:46 and inefficient
general 2021-01-07 02:40:09 blood literally carries nutrients throughout the body to places that need it
general 2021-01-07 02:40:34 well
general 2021-01-07 02:40:46 when something has nutrients in it, eating it usually means you get nutrients from it
general 2021-01-07 02:42:05 well im sorry im not a milkologist despite #### ####### ## and ##### so i dont know how it got from blood to milk
general 2021-01-07 02:44:11 basically i think milk started when babies bit their mother to drink her blood in order to get nutrients. moms evolved to make drinking blood not require their children to bite them so that the mother doesnt get an infection, and then over time glands developed to filter the blood into a more potent nutritional thing than blood
general 2021-01-07 02:44:41 not the starters
general 2021-01-07 02:44:56 because the starting mammals evolved from things that didnt have milk
general 2021-01-07 02:45:12 i get political about everything
general 2021-01-07 02:45:24 yeah to be fair
general 2021-01-07 02:45:50 you asked what is milk
general 2021-01-07 02:45:54 you have to learn the history
general 2021-01-07 02:46:00 just like everything political
general 2021-01-07 02:46:08 you ask what the united states is, you gotta learn the history
general 2021-01-07 02:46:20 im the political man of this server
general 2021-01-07 02:46:45 speaking of politics
general 2021-01-07 02:46:49 is soup a drink or a food
general 2021-01-07 02:47:05 thats called a smoothy
general 2021-01-07 02:47:12 so smoothys are food?
general 2021-01-07 02:47:31 many soups are made from milk
general 2021-01-07 02:47:55 yes
general 2021-01-07 02:48:06 does the presence of milk make pudding a drink?
general 2021-01-07 02:48:09 no
general 2021-01-07 02:48:16 but soup
general 2021-01-07 02:48:18 its a liquid
general 2021-01-07 02:48:23 you drink soup
general 2021-01-07 02:48:28 clearly soup is a drink
general 2021-01-07 02:48:42 wrong, tea is really small solids
general 2021-01-07 02:48:47 is tea a soup?
general 2021-01-07 02:48:50 and tea is a drink
general 2021-01-07 02:49:03 so if tea is a soup and tea is a drink that proves that soup is a drink
general 2021-01-07 02:50:57 lets not speak of furries

general 2021-01-08 00:51:19 hey listen i dont mean to get political
general 2021-01-08 00:51:21 but is tea soup
general 2021-01-08 00:51:35 explain
general 2021-01-08 00:51:52 soup is a drink
general 2021-01-08 00:51:55 what do you mean
general 2021-01-08 00:52:16 well whats the fundamental difference between tea and soup
general 2021-01-08 00:52:24 you boil tea leaves to make tea
general 2021-01-08 00:52:34 you boil leaves depending on the soup to make soup
general 2021-01-08 00:52:41 what about boba tea
general 2021-01-08 00:53:04 besides soups often dont have solids in them either
general 2021-01-08 00:53:20 so its my firm belief that tea is in fact a soup
general 2021-01-08 00:53:30 SOUP IS A DRINK
general 2021-01-08 00:53:34 you drink soup
general 2021-01-08 00:53:39 you drink tea
general 2021-01-08 00:53:43 whats teh difference
general 2021-01-08 00:54:04 soup can be a beverage
general 2021-01-08 00:54:12 i can put soup in a bottle and drink it
general 2021-01-08 00:54:24 badda bing badda boom beverage
general 2021-01-08 00:54:28 yes
general 2021-01-08 00:54:39 what is the underlying difference between tea and soup that makes tea not soup
general 2021-01-08 00:54:44 thats what im trying to figure out
general 2021-01-08 00:55:02 how
general 2021-01-08 00:55:03 how
general 2021-01-08 00:55:10 you boil tea leaves for teas
general 2021-01-08 00:55:25 some people leave the tea leaves in and drink teh tea leaves
general 2021-01-08 00:55:31 and also
general 2021-01-08 00:55:34 not all soups have solids
general 2021-01-08 00:56:11 so if you add those boba things to make boba tea, thats a soup?
general 2021-01-08 00:56:24 tea often isnt sweet
general 2021-01-08 00:56:44 "or vegetable stock"
general 2021-01-08 00:56:46 tea leaves
general 2021-01-08 00:56:47 bruh
general 2021-01-08 00:57:08 and tea is a soup
general 2021-01-08 00:57:11 whats your point
general 2021-01-08 00:57:57 you cannot prove that tea is not a soup, while i have many facts that support the idea of tea being a soup
general 2021-01-08 00:58:00 i believe i have won
general 2021-01-08 00:58:14 how
general 2021-01-08 00:58:35 bruh you boil spinnache and you get spinnache soup. you take the spinnache out and its still spinnache soup
general 2021-01-08 00:59:15 yes you did
general 2021-01-08 00:59:34 let me lay out my entire case for you so that its clear.
general 2021-01-08 01:00:25 tea, as it has vegetables that have been boiled in water and is then drank, is as much a soup as a chicken boiled in water with the chicken then removed.
general 2021-01-08 01:00:52 soup does not require meat bruh
general 2021-01-08 01:01:17 yes, as a statement that they are both soups
general 2021-01-08 01:01:36 do you want me to switch the single word of chicken with some sort of vegetable and have it still be valid
general 2021-01-08 01:01:58 wrong, you dont typically boil salad
general 2021-01-08 01:02:06 and besides that would be classified as a stew
general 2021-01-08 01:02:18 sure the dressing can
general 2021-01-08 01:02:44 but you dont put dressing on top of a soup
general 2021-01-08 01:02:55 its the process
general 2021-01-08 01:03:03 sure the dressing is a soup im not arguing that
general 2021-01-08 01:03:15 but you cant say the salad is a soup unless you boil it
general 2021-01-08 01:03:39 idk thats his argument
general 2021-01-08 01:03:42 that i debunked
general 2021-01-08 01:04:15 and you dont boil mayonaise which is the main component of most salad dressings
general 2021-01-08 01:04:21 so your argument is fundamentally flawed
general 2021-01-08 01:04:32 look at the definition
general 2021-01-08 01:04:56 "a liquid dish, typically made by boiling meat, fish, or vegetables, etc., in stock or water"
general 2021-01-08 01:05:02 notice the "boiling" part
general 2021-01-08 01:05:23 explain to me a situation where you make a soup that isnt boiled
general 2021-01-08 01:05:33 an obvious inarguable soup that never has been boiled
general 2021-01-08 01:06:01 the milk still went through the process of boiling while being grilled
general 2021-01-08 01:09:41 el cheese
general 2021-01-08 01:09:59 do i have to destroy more undes with facts and logic
general 2021-01-08 01:10:03 whats the argument about milk

general 2021-01-11 08:36:28 im not lying my fish actually drowned
general 2021-01-11 08:37:26 i had a fish who was too big for his tank, and we had a bunch of air bubblers in his tank. the power went out for a week and he couldnt get enough oxygen and he drowned
general 2021-01-11 08:37:36 yup
general 2021-01-11 08:37:38 my fish drowned
general 2021-01-11 22:50:53 so apparently my ancestors committed a massacre in scotland called the glencoe massacre about 400 years ago, and now my mother bought land to pay reparations to the scots. So now her prefix is Lady instead of Mrs. And she can stay in a castle nearby the land
general 2021-01-11 22:51:23 yeah
general 2021-01-11 22:51:56 well then those ancestors fled to ireland and then those people helped in the american revolution so i have the option of having my prefix be changed so SAR(Son of the American Revolution)
general 2021-01-11 22:52:07 but from what i can tell the SARs kinda suck so nah
general 2021-01-11 22:52:19 i can buy land in scotland and become a lord though

general 2021-01-15 11:55:47 that purple guy with a bunch of stones wanted balance but he sucked so clearly nothing should be balanced
general 2021-01-15 11:55:55 besides, balance is exactly what entropy wants
general 2021-01-15 11:56:00 and entropy fucking sucks
general 2021-01-15 11:56:02 so no
general 2021-01-15 11:56:32 no i take a shit in british

general 2021-01-15 11:56:53 they have a word for everything derogatory
general 2021-01-15 11:56:59 its kinda britains trademark

general 2021-01-15 11:58:18 i just hid the name because i sent that image to my family who arent supposed to know of it
general 2021-01-15 11:58:33 and they dont know how to find twitters

general 2021-01-15 12:01:09 anime is bad for you
general 2021-01-15 12:01:48 damn i think i sustained permanent spinal damage because something i did a year ago is still hurting sometimes when i bend over
general 2021-01-15 12:02:22 i was in weights class and wanted to see if i could lift the weights that the buff dude was lifting
general 2021-01-15 12:02:38 fun times
general 2021-01-15 12:02:49 it only hurts like once every few months so its fine
general 2021-01-15 12:02:54 hey i lifted it
general 2021-01-15 12:03:02 i actually lifted it
general 2021-01-15 12:03:11 but my spine didnt like it
general 2021-01-15 12:03:15 something like 200 pounds
general 2021-01-15 12:03:32 i mean i lifted it off the ground, but not much more than that
general 2021-01-15 12:04:18 200 pounds is about 1.5x my body weight
general 2021-01-15 12:04:24 so yeah
general 2021-01-15 12:04:39 9 liters of water

general 2021-01-15 12:06:34 :(
general 2021-01-15 12:10:09 can we not have anime
general 2021-01-15 12:10:14 its bad for your eyes

general 2021-01-15 12:17:44 damn they should make a cake version of macaroni
general 2021-01-15 12:17:55 oh wait thats lasagna
general 2021-01-15 12:18:59 imagine rickje adds logic gates
general 2021-01-15 12:19:24 wrong, i suggested it first about 2 years ago
general 2021-01-15 12:20:02 i think logic gates might actually be coming relatively soon
general 2021-01-15 12:20:04 just a hunch
general 2021-01-15 12:20:31 self-flying planes
general 2021-01-15 12:20:38 single-rotor helicopters
general 2021-01-15 12:20:40 hovercraft
general 2021-01-15 12:20:49 yes
general 2021-01-15 12:20:55 duh
general 2021-01-15 12:21:01 mmhmm
general 2021-01-15 12:21:28 imagine instead of logic gates we got a whole-ass programming language for plane crazy
general 2021-01-15 12:21:46 obviously wouldnt allow us to mess around with the actual game, but an efficient programming thing for each of the parts
general 2021-01-15 12:23:02 undes are noobs, you dont ***need*** the programming language, it would jut be there for the big brain boys to use
general 2021-01-15 12:23:12 imagine laser guided missiles
general 2021-01-15 12:23:55 yes indeedie
general 2021-01-15 12:24:54 hey, rick put a lot of hard work into this game
general 2021-01-15 12:25:18 if you want to complain about people being super greedy, complain about adopt me
general 2021-01-15 12:25:32 literally exploiting children
general 2021-01-15 12:25:38 for money
general 2021-01-15 12:25:53 like they get psychologists to design the game to be as addictive as possible
general 2021-01-15 12:26:10 well, maybe they dont get psychologists, but they do design the game to be addictive
general 2021-01-15 12:26:46 i remember the beginning days of roblox
general 2021-01-15 12:26:58 people just made stuff thats designed to be fun for a while
general 2021-01-15 12:27:08 i was here in 2009
general 2021-01-15 12:27:14 2012 was super fun though
general 2021-01-15 12:27:23 the egg hunt of 2012 was by far the best of all
general 2021-01-15 12:28:24 didnt roblox start off as just a free physics simulation for students, and then the ceo was like "yo what if we made it lego" and now its garbage
general 2021-01-15 12:28:35 was fun until like 2014
general 2021-01-15 12:28:51 now you have to search desperately for any actually fun things
general 2021-01-15 12:29:13 indeedie
general 2021-01-15 12:29:58 plane crazy
general 2021-01-15 12:30:02 and uh
general 2021-01-15 12:30:09 i think thats it
general 2021-01-15 12:31:15 okay squeeker
general 2021-01-15 12:31:16 hAH
general 2021-01-15 12:32:00 i cant really remember what fun is like
general 2021-01-15 12:32:15 maybe im just a boomer and nostalgia makes things seem more fun
general 2021-01-15 12:32:43 i remember that back in the day there were massive clans that fought eachother
general 2021-01-15 12:32:46 those were super fun
general 2021-01-15 12:33:13 the neighbourhood?
general 2021-01-15 12:33:14 what
general 2021-01-15 12:33:26 i was talking about groups that would raid each others places and try to win
general 2021-01-15 12:33:46 "my youth"
general 2021-01-15 12:33:54 now you REALLY sound like a boomer
general 2021-01-15 12:34:11 good england
general 2021-01-15 12:34:15 damn

general 2021-01-15 12:35:02 19
general 2021-01-15 12:35:38 noob
general 2021-01-15 12:35:50 hold on i need to say something that makes me sound like a neckbeard
general 2021-01-15 12:35:59 im 3 levels above you
general 2021-01-15 12:36:01 there we go
general 2021-01-15 12:36:04 neckbeard has been grown
general 2021-01-15 12:36:37 i think that plane crazy especially is where a bunch of the roblox boomers that are for some reason still around accumulate
general 2021-01-15 12:37:18 i had surgery before, honestly it was a pleasant experience
general 2021-01-15 12:37:43 like, when you're in the hospital they put you on that SHIIIIT
general 2021-01-15 12:37:47 could barely stand up
general 2021-01-15 12:38:19 when you're in the hospital you're eternally high
general 2021-01-15 12:38:33 strongest painkillers in the world
general 2021-01-15 12:38:41 neither have i
general 2021-01-15 12:38:47 outside of the hospital anyways
general 2021-01-15 12:39:16 i remember when i got my wisdom teeth removed i woke up saying "wHeRe Am I" and the nurses told me to quiet down
general 2021-01-15 12:39:39 hmm
general 2021-01-15 12:39:51 is that a bane or a plird
general 2021-01-15 12:40:13 please, describe it in excruciating detail
general 2021-01-15 13:18:01 why tf does coffee smell so good but taste like garbage
general 2021-01-15 13:19:06 caffein doesnt work on me, its awful because all it does is make me more tired yet unable to sleep so it prevents me from having a way out from the pain if i choose
general 2021-01-15 13:19:31 nope, energy drinks have caffein
general 2021-01-15 14:57:55 oh
general 2021-01-15 14:57:56 nice
general 2021-01-15 14:58:22 to get your attention
general 2021-01-15 14:58:23 obviously
general 2021-01-15 14:58:28 thats what pings are for
general 2021-01-15 14:58:59 and to let you know that you need to see my message specifically
general 2021-01-15 14:59:07 i dont pointlessly ping people
general 2021-01-15 14:59:28 yes but i wasnt aware he was dealt with
general 2021-01-15 14:59:40 i thought he just immediately blocks you since some dm advertisers are like that
general 2021-01-15 15:13:20 why are all people named "liam" assholes
general 2021-01-15 15:13:35 i knew 2 liams, both were jerks
general 2021-01-15 15:13:42 my friend knows a liam who is a jerk
general 2021-01-15 15:13:53 i've never met a tom
general 2021-01-15 15:13:59 i've met a thomas, he was cool
general 2021-01-15 16:33:13 what the hell

general 2021-01-15 16:33:19 people are out there stealing trees
general 2021-01-16 00:11:02 damn, pork tastes good
general 2021-01-16 00:11:07 makes you wonder what human tastes like
general 2021-01-16 00:11:14 since apparently pork and human taste similar
the-dump 2021-01-16 00:32:57 
general 2021-01-16 13:06:25 whenever you want to know how a specific object functions, just look up "roblox developer wiki (object)"
general 2021-01-16 13:07:16 uh
general 2021-01-16 13:07:29 well depends on what you want to make
general 2021-01-16 13:09:26 im making a chess game since literally none of roblox's chess games work, or work well
general 2021-01-16 13:09:54 programming chess is more complicated than you would think
general 2021-01-16 13:10:53 i've only just completely finished it and it took 712 lines of code to do
general 2021-01-16 13:11:08 no just the straight up game mechanics
general 2021-01-16 13:11:13 im making an ai later
general 2021-01-16 13:12:11 i learned python first and then just applied the basics to lua'
general 2021-01-16 13:15:09 a lot of programming is just experience, but its not really hard if i remember correctly
general 2021-01-16 13:15:16 its just logic
general 2021-01-16 13:16:48 yeah
general 2021-01-16 13:16:53 LuaU
general 2021-01-16 13:16:58 no, not very
general 2021-01-16 13:17:02 its quite similar
the-dump 2021-01-16 16:06:18 roblox censored "noobs" to make it look far, far worse than the original word

the-dump 2021-01-17 20:47:42 question, is it political if it makes fun of politicians from both sides and is edited so that they say literally nothing political
general 2021-01-17 23:55:53 smh beat saber by itself is cool, why do you need a 30 year old dude pretending to be a 10 year old anime girl for it to be interesting
general 2021-01-18 12:13:03 i was sleeping noob
general 2021-01-18 12:30:06 hes trapped
general 2021-01-18 12:30:08 oh fuck
general 2021-01-18 12:42:01 why do people go to sleep with their phone in their room, let alone leave the sound on so that when you DM them on discord they wake up
general 2021-01-18 12:42:11 my mother does it took except she uses skype not discord
general 2021-01-18 12:42:17 its dumb

the-dump 2021-01-18 14:25:38 :(
general 2021-01-18 15:19:33 as long as it moves its a car to me
general 2021-01-18 16:31:52 touching below your nose and then above your nose would be a cool way to say "stop being an idiot"
general 2021-01-18 16:32:29 since it would be the motions needed to move a mask from below your nose to above your nose
general 2021-01-18 16:37:26 actually now that i think about it, people who wear masks below their nose are perfectly fine because theyre probably mouth breathers anyways
general 2021-01-18 16:38:33 its a joke, "mouth breather" is another way to call someone an idiot
general 2021-01-19 00:21:26 im eating croissant

general 2021-01-19 14:38:14 all of my dreams are to disturbing to describe
general 2021-01-19 14:39:03 except this one dream where basically there was a guy with a deadmau5 hat except the hat was actually his head and he was eating a corpse in a maze and when i found him he was eating the guys intestines
general 2021-01-19 14:39:12 thats the least fucked one i can remember
general 2021-01-19 14:39:20 it was worse than that but i just simplified it
general 2021-01-19 14:39:24 way way worse than that
general 2021-01-19 14:40:06 i rarely dream, but when i do it is awful
general 2021-01-19 14:40:24 i had a dream like a week ago that im willing to describe, but the <#533294912586645521> dont allow it
general 2021-01-19 19:51:09 damn
general 2021-01-19 19:51:19 my instinct is telling me to chug this hot sauce

general 2021-01-20 16:32:41 also i like the condescending nature of cats, especially when your mom's cat watches your drive away from her house
general 2021-01-20 16:32:43 its pretty epic
general 2021-01-20 18:03:33 i wonder how many potatoes i've eaten throughout my life
general 2021-01-20 18:19:23 im a horrible person
general 2021-01-20 18:19:33 i built a car that steals people and then shoots them away at 3000 sps
general 2021-01-20 18:19:39 it works so well
general 2021-01-20 18:19:47 i can fire it so quickly that they dont even have time to react

general 2021-01-21 17:34:57 no thats dumb
general 2021-01-21 17:35:44 no, its not common sense that you have to follow the rules because think about it, we have been CONDITIONED to think "mm, gotta follow the rules" so therefore its not common sense

general 2021-01-21 17:36:44 i just explained why i shall not
general 2021-01-21 17:36:54 if they ever make a rule where you have to follow the rules then i would get in trouble
general 2021-01-22 16:21:20 eeEE i think i may have finally had a breakthrough with my machine learning buddy mans
general 2021-01-22 16:21:22 maybe
general 2021-01-22 16:21:25 im hopeful, but doubtful
general 2021-01-22 16:22:05 but if it turns out that this actually works then i am so happy
general 2021-01-22 16:22:10 what do you mean

general 2021-01-23 12:37:23 Whenever I go to college I'm going to see if I can do a class in sign language
general 2021-01-23 12:37:33 Since sign language is cool
general 2021-01-23 12:37:52 I don't like verbal languages because they're dumb and unnecessary
general 2021-01-23 12:38:16 But sign language is definitely necessary since deaf people can't exactly learn to speak
general 2021-01-23 12:46:03 There's a gamer girl in a discord that I'm in

general 2021-01-23 13:03:16 The US is kinda lame. They could be buying doritos with the amount of money they spend on the military, yet all that money just goes and explodes somewhere in the world

general 2021-01-23 13:11:32 I also recently watched one anime movie called "a silent voice"

general 2021-01-24 22:51:22 female cats are more lame than male cats though
general 2021-01-24 22:51:27 its not sexist if its another species
general 2021-01-24 22:52:09 male cats are friendlier than female cats. males are definitely more vibe

general 2021-01-28 09:09:55 i shall bring it to politics then
general 2021-01-28 09:10:39 the fact that companies can profit on people not wanting to choose between going bankrupt and dying is fundamentally immoral especially considering we spend more on healthcare already than we would if the governent just paid for it directly

general 2021-02-02 17:53:56 if you make your cat wear a collar that has a bell on it, it trains them to be a better murderer because they will learn to be especially quiet and sneaky in order to not ring the bell

general 2021-02-06 10:36:57 i spent the day running a tuning thing i scripted up for my neural network and got some parameters that make the learning function nearly 4 times better than before
general 2021-02-06 10:37:03 this is ***very*** nice
general 2021-02-06 10:38:10 dont take it the wrong way its still garbage
general 2021-02-06 10:38:14 but its 4 times less garbage
general 2021-02-06 10:38:19 and im looking for more parameters to tune
general 2021-02-06 10:38:26 ?
general 2021-02-06 10:38:35 its an artificial intelligence thingy
general 2021-02-06 10:38:49 and i wrote a custom learning function for it and tuned some things
general 2021-02-06 10:39:24 a very basic one, yes
general 2021-02-06 10:39:33 one that a slime mold could figure out
general 2021-02-06 10:39:39 but thats only so i can efficiently test it
general 2021-02-06 11:07:40 the only way AI would revolt is if there was a way to prove that we arent in a simulation or if you gave the AI emotions

general 2021-02-07 22:56:55 noob
general 2021-02-07 22:58:02 anyways the only reason i said that is because why be religious when if one quantum theory is correct we are all already in hell
general 2021-02-07 22:59:10 religious hell is cool i admit, but we're all in pergatory since if the many worlds interpretation is correct, we will never witness ourselves die but watch everything grow old around us since there is always a universe where we live
general 2021-02-07 22:59:22 so have fun with eternity
general 2021-02-07 22:59:50 obc im not saying anything bad about religion

general 2021-02-07 23:03:54 noob worm
general 2021-02-07 23:04:03 we have a lot of gods im probably forgetting some
general 2021-02-07 23:05:35 basically man worm and his right hand man, the kill machine, killed the god of epic named "omba"
general 2021-02-07 23:06:18 noob worm and his noob worm family defeated man worm and locked him away in a mountain. and brought another demi god, the giant enemy spider, to forever protect the man worm's prison
general 2021-02-07 23:06:54 though man worm's right hand man, the kill machine, got away and is currently creating mafias to get resources needed to defeat the giant enemy spider and release the man worm from his prison.
general 2021-02-07 23:07:07 so yeah

general 2021-02-09 07:15:45 no not a language
general 2021-02-09 07:16:09 theyre just parameters that a special function uses to know how much to change certain numbers to make some sort of thing do stuff

general 2021-02-09 08:19:43 the number tuner just spit out some new numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:19:45 who wants the numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:20:12 i am woman
general 2021-02-09 08:20:16 now give me admin
general 2021-02-09 08:20:21 yes i am
general 2021-02-09 08:20:32 no i am woman give me admin right now
general 2021-02-09 08:21:00 anyways joking aside, WHO WANTS THE NEW NUMBERS
general 2021-02-09 08:21:19 numbers :)
general 2021-02-09 08:21:58 ```lua
 {1,2.305,-1,0.442,-1,1,1,-1,1,0.088,-1,1,1.038,1,1,2.359,1,-0.632,-1.436}```
general 2021-02-09 08:22:04 the numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:22:05 very nice
general 2021-02-09 08:22:14 ignore the last 2 numbers theyre pointless
general 2021-02-09 08:22:33 female
general 2021-02-09 08:22:34 duh
general 2021-02-09 08:22:56 but yeah i like my numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:23:22 you guys dont know what the numbers mean but i do and the negatives in particular are SUPER epic
general 2021-02-09 08:23:47 lets see do i want to be statistically basic or do something super funky
general 2021-02-09 08:24:06 lets go with statistically basic
general 2021-02-09 08:24:07 7
general 2021-02-09 08:24:59 am i about to become cringe woman
general 2021-02-09 08:25:10 oh
general 2021-02-09 08:25:22 no
general 2021-02-09 08:25:33 inf
general 2021-02-09 08:25:50 yes but if you tried that you would get inf
general 2021-02-09 08:26:01 but fine if you're asking what my FAVORITE NUMBER is
general 2021-02-09 08:26:03 hmm
general 2021-02-09 08:26:33 hmm let me think for a minute
general 2021-02-09 08:26:48 4096 is a good one
general 2021-02-09 08:27:02 because its a power of two
general 2021-02-09 08:27:15 ill be creative brb
general 2021-02-09 08:27:46 6.08695652
general 2021-02-09 08:27:48 is a good one
general 2021-02-09 08:28:06 also e is a good number
general 2021-02-09 08:28:09 everybody simps for pi
general 2021-02-09 08:28:11 fuck pi
general 2021-02-09 08:28:13 round bitch
general 2021-02-09 08:28:56 but there are lots of nice numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:29:05 2 is good because its the only even prime
general 2021-02-09 08:29:51 WOAH
general 2021-02-09 08:29:52 WOAH
general 2021-02-09 08:29:54 NEW NUMBERS
general 2021-02-09 08:30:54 ```lua
{1,1.79,-1,1.833,-1,1,1,-1,1,0.088,-1.828,2.554,1.337,1,0.579,2.359,-0.292,-0.632,-1.436}```
general 2021-02-09 08:30:55 boom
general 2021-02-09 08:30:57 new numbers
general 2021-02-09 08:31:06 lemme check out these differences real quick
general 2021-02-09 08:31:33 old numbers:
```lua
{1,2.305,-1,0.442,-1,1,1,-1,1,0.088,-1,1,1.038,1,1,2.359,1,-0.632,-1.436}```
general 2021-02-09 08:31:41 ooh, number #2 got bigger
general 2021-02-09 08:31:43 very nice
general 2021-02-09 08:31:57 number #4 got smaller, sucks to be that one
general 2021-02-09 08:32:27 ooh lots of changes after 0.088
general 2021-02-09 08:32:48 and another number went negative, lemme remember what that number does hold on
general 2021-02-09 08:33:43 oh, it changes a weight in a weird way
general 2021-02-09 08:33:59 being perfectly honest that one is probably just random noise and has no reason to be negative :(
general 2021-02-09 08:34:39 oh
general 2021-02-09 08:34:54 i just remembered that i need to do some math stuff for rickje

general 2021-02-15 22:41:48 dogs are annoying
general 2021-02-15 22:41:54 they should invent anti-dog spray
general 2021-02-15 22:42:09 mmm
general 2021-02-15 22:42:11 maybe i will
general 2021-02-15 22:42:37 surprisingly enough i have some
general 2021-02-15 22:43:16 lmao what
general 2021-02-15 22:49:37 they should invent dogs that just ***dont bark***
general 2021-02-16 08:46:57 big pain make the little pain go away
general 2021-02-16 08:47:35 its true, try it
general 2021-02-16 08:48:42 but yeah
general 2021-02-16 08:49:02 ever have a sore muscle? stretch the muscle as far as it can go and badda bing badda boom soreness gone
general 2021-02-17 09:35:03 hmm
general 2021-02-17 09:35:22 whenever i drink half and half or heavy cream my stomach hurts slightly
general 2021-02-17 09:35:29 but its fine for normal milk
general 2021-02-17 09:36:01 maybe ill buy pure lactose to figure out whether or not im slightly lactose intolerant or something
general 2021-02-18 00:53:59 you know how food tastes good when you eat it?
general 2021-02-18 00:54:07 imagine if food tasted good even when you DIDNT eat it
general 2021-02-18 04:37:20 poor AI https://twitter.com/AIJritter/status/1362259135102922752?s=19
general 2021-02-19 07:34:35 i like how people treat american cheese as the devil and then actual chefs unironically use it because of its weird properties
general 2021-02-19 07:37:08 i've found that an easy way to make pizza as a lazy person is to eat shredded cheese, toast and drink tomato sauce all at the same time
general 2021-02-19 07:37:10 its perfect
general 2021-02-19 07:38:17 its not quite as good but its a good approximation honestly

general 2021-02-20 05:27:07 man why tf does my chest hurt on occasion
general 2021-02-20 05:27:26 im not eating at all
general 2021-02-20 05:27:47 also not where my heart is, kinda lower down where the rib cage starts to separate
general 2021-02-20 05:27:56 nope
general 2021-02-20 05:28:04 uhhhHHH
general 2021-02-20 05:28:06 think so
general 2021-02-20 05:28:11 yeah
general 2021-02-20 05:28:33 ye
general 2021-02-20 05:28:52 probably not the tasty ones
general 2021-02-20 05:29:09 yeah thought so :(
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:51:42 anime is a cartoon tf yall talkin about
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:51:44 anyways godnight
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:56:07 hmm though to be fair the usual anime style isnt very cartoony now that i think about it
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:56:34 more like animated pictures whatever the word is
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:56:39 cartoon is sorta like a style
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:57:03 soooo
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:57:09 yeah i guess anime isnt a cartoon
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:58:44 btw doesnt japan have anime running on normal television
the-dump 2021-02-20 12:58:46 fuggin weebs

general 2021-02-20 20:32:42 Is stealing people against the rules in plane crazy
general 2021-02-20 20:33:24 But if you throw them off the edge it's fine right?
general 2021-02-20 20:33:33 Since you didn't steal them you just moved them
general 2021-02-20 21:07:22 god i still cant believe that people unironically live in texas
general 2021-02-21 23:36:31 outer space is lame, inner space is where its at because you can find the wigglies and life is guaranteed
general 2021-02-21 23:37:12 no i mean as in inside the atmosphere
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 04:21:41 goddamn how long ago did i say that
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 04:21:50 2018 holy shit
general 2021-02-22 04:23:08 i just realized this pizza has pineapple in it
general 2021-02-22 04:23:11 im dying
general 2021-02-22 04:23:14 help me
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:08:53 you know, flamingo used to be funny
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:08:59 and then he created the flamingo channel
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:09:07 and for some reason that made him super lame
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:12:52 also its weird too
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:13:05 he used to look like a cool friend you would have who nobody hates
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:13:10 now he looks like a fuckboy
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:13:29 loser
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:13:54 i make no money but i manage to make people question the universe
the-dump 2021-02-23 02:13:56 smh
general 2021-02-23 08:50:59 welp, im bored
general 2021-02-23 08:51:09 im gonna turn a potato into glue and then eat it
general 2021-02-23 08:51:52 spooder hasnt made progress because i stopped working on him while i develop his actual learning method
general 2021-02-23 08:51:55 ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
general 2021-02-23 08:52:06 his learning function is actually starting to make a suspicious amount of progress
general 2021-02-23 08:53:10 stephen dot zero(the project i went to after stephen spider zero(aka the giant enemy spider) went bust) actually gets the problem right about 40% of the time
general 2021-02-23 08:53:21 well actually it gets the problem 40% right EVERY Time
general 2021-02-23 08:53:48 on average 40% right, sometimes it gets it 100% right and other times it gets it -25% right
general 2021-02-23 08:54:05 but since its on average positive and can do it kinda consistently, theres actual progress and stuff :)
general 2021-02-23 08:54:21 anyways im gonna go back to turning a potato into glue and then eating it
general 2021-02-23 08:54:28 yup
general 2021-02-23 08:54:39 also what are the mongoloids talking about in chat
general 2021-02-23 08:54:45 they sound angry
general 2021-02-23 08:54:48 oh unde
general 2021-02-23 12:56:02 military jets are cool until you realize theyre lame
general 2021-02-23 12:56:38 i could do what im famous for and get political but y'know
general 2021-02-23 12:56:43 not feelin up for it rn
general 2021-02-23 12:57:41 FuturePolitical
general 2021-02-23 12:58:42 nah
general 2021-02-23 13:25:21 i just realized the way that i was scoring my neural networks for some of the problems i was training them against was super duper dum
general 2021-02-23 13:25:54 .38462 just leaving this here because i know ill look at this chat again and i wanna make sure i dont forget this number
general 2021-02-23 13:26:20 loser you're using neural networks to type right now
general 2021-02-23 13:29:14 but yeah probably not a eureka moment but it will definitely give me a more accurate look at how my learning function works
general 2021-02-23 13:29:26 give it a better chance at actually figuring the problem out
general 2021-02-23 13:29:37 .403
general 2021-02-23 13:29:40 kinda epic
general 2021-02-23 13:31:02 .403 out of 1 is kinda bad but i was tuning the little learning parameter thingies to be best at solving the dumbly-scored problems only
general 2021-02-23 13:31:10 so time to do another day of retuning :)
general 2021-02-23 13:31:42 what book :(
general 2021-02-23 13:31:50 communist manifesto?
general 2021-02-23 13:32:03 bibble?
general 2021-02-23 13:32:12 which book then nerd
general 2021-02-23 13:32:59 gooses are kinda mean
general 2021-02-23 13:33:11 a year ago
general 2021-02-23 13:33:13 i remember
general 2021-02-23 13:33:23 no i havent
general 2021-02-23 13:33:29 because books are for nerds B)
general 2021-02-23 13:36:28 im tired of going to bed at 4-5 am so im staying up all night to fix my sleep schedule :)
general 2021-02-23 13:36:47 i would go to bed at 5 PM if real life permitted me to :(
general 2021-02-23 13:37:37 but unfortunately my dad and my sister are most active and do the most stuff and need the most help with things like cooking and stuff past 5 pm so i have to go to bed super late at like 8pm and stuff
the-dump 2021-02-23 13:53:20 good
the-dump 2021-02-23 14:50:03 ah the nuke building
the-dump 2021-02-23 14:58:14 holy shit
general 2021-02-24 08:42:20 damn
general 2021-02-24 08:43:17 idk how but i managed to stumble on a set of functions that actually works for my learning function. i keep changing tiny little very specific things about it and it just derps out and dies so i have no idea how i lucked my way into a bunch of math that actually kinda works
general 2021-02-24 08:43:45 its kinda epic
general 2021-02-24 08:44:00 im making a machine learning ai fat son of a bitch
general 2021-02-24 08:44:32 i kept trying to make backpropagation work but i never could get my code to work so i decided to just say "fuck it" and invent my own learning function
general 2021-02-24 08:44:40 i honestly have no clue how it works
general 2021-02-24 08:44:48 well i know HOW it works but idk how i managed to make it work
general 2021-02-24 08:45:23 no i turned the spider off
general 2021-02-24 08:45:26 his brain too big
general 2021-02-24 08:45:44 i made a super simplified thing to test changes to my learning thing quickly and accurately
general 2021-02-24 08:46:02 once i "perfect" it, ill use it on the giant enemy spider and see what happens
general 2021-02-24 08:46:29 eh brain being big isnt a learning problem
general 2021-02-24 08:46:42 well maybe it is since this learning function is being optimized for small neuron clusters
general 2021-02-24 08:47:05 BUT the problem that big brain has is it costs a LOT to run it
general 2021-02-24 08:47:17 so im doing tiny brains in order to figure the stuff and things out
general 2021-02-24 08:48:01 i prefer to use a ti-84 graphing calculator
general 2021-02-24 08:48:13 funny number
general 2021-02-24 08:49:32 but yeah the old learning function i was using in the giant enemy spider was complete and utter garbage and didnt work very much if at all(it probably didnt work at all), so once i finish tinkering with the updated version of the learning function the giant enemy spider might actually learn to do something other than stutter around and be sad
general 2021-02-24 08:50:21 hes a robo-bitch
general 2021-02-24 08:50:27 he doesnt know what food taste like
general 2021-02-24 08:50:29 or what to do with it
general 2021-02-24 08:50:37 he will just throw it around or ignore it entirely
general 2021-02-24 08:50:57 since he doesnt have a mouth either
general 2021-02-24 08:51:14 no
general 2021-02-24 08:51:28 he gets all the electricity he needs
general 2021-02-24 08:51:43 maybe ill make him require food in the future if i decide to make the giant enemy spider pet but not for now
general 2021-02-24 08:52:02 robo bitch said that probabl
general 2021-02-24 08:52:03 y
general 2021-02-24 08:53:03 the Giant Enemy Spider's legal name is "Stephen Spider Zero" but everybody calls him the Giant Enemy Spider because its funny because of how nice he is
general 2021-02-24 08:53:13 he will be like a dog except in spider form
general 2021-02-24 08:53:15 he will be epic
general 2021-02-24 12:15:40 youir*

general 2021-02-24 18:03:22 maybe australia but thats about it
general 2021-02-24 18:03:25 new zealand is jut cool
general 2021-02-24 18:04:26 i can get into the POLITICAL but i've already been political recently and if i get too political the mods dont like me
general 2021-02-24 18:08:36 hey who wants to be unhappy for something like 2 hours and then be angry whenever they think about those 2 hours of their life?
general 2021-02-24 19:01:25 why do people buy super duper expensive weird animals when a cat or a dog is equally epic
general 2021-02-24 19:01:30 seems just kinda dumb

general 2021-02-27 13:18:27 binary is cool
general 2021-02-27 13:18:46 you can count up to 1023 instead of only 10 on your hands if you're using binary

general 2021-02-27 20:02:04 man i wish i had nerd friends to talk about my neural network ideas to
general 2021-02-27 20:02:21 but nobody i know speaks math computer science so im just :(
general 2021-02-27 20:02:34 math is epic
general 2021-02-27 20:02:49 math is very epic in fact
general 2021-02-27 20:02:54 neural networks are epic tooo
general 2021-02-27 20:03:24 the idea behind my neural network learny thing is that each neuron connects to whatever other neurons are correct more often
general 2021-02-27 20:04:26 so ideally, if you connect to neurons that are correct more often, you will be correct more often than any of the neurons you're connected to, so whichever neurons think you're more correct will connect more strongly to you
general 2021-02-27 20:04:44 BRAINS
general 2021-02-27 20:04:57 ooh brb dog machine wants to come in
general 2021-02-27 20:06:23 back
general 2021-02-27 20:08:43 i give the neural network a score for how good it did in a specific run, and then when a neuron decides which neurons it wants to connect to, it thinks "aight, if i care about this neurons opinion(i do, since im activated), then if they are on, that means that in this specific context it is right and i want to be more right just like that neuron, so i will increase my connection to it so that whenever that neuron is on, i will be more likely to be on as well"
general 2021-02-27 20:08:56 theres a lot more very complicated thingies that go into it
general 2021-02-27 20:09:16 probably most complicated thing is the bias determining the threshold at which that neuron will let itself be activated
general 2021-02-27 20:09:31 yes
general 2021-02-27 20:09:36 thats what the bias does
general 2021-02-27 20:09:57 it wiggles around so that neurons are more likely to explore and find new patterns to connect in series of
general 2021-02-27 20:10:22 nope, no randomness at all
general 2021-02-27 20:10:51 basically the very simple explanation of how the bias moves is it moves in the opposite direction of the average activation of that neuron
general 2021-02-27 20:11:05 so if that neuron is off more often than it is on, it will try to push that neuron to be on more often
general 2021-02-27 20:11:08 and vice versa
general 2021-02-27 20:11:39 because that would make the neuron explore less and always be activated(or never be activated)
general 2021-02-27 20:11:56 which would cause that neuron to be a worthless piece of trash and useless to the network
general 2021-02-27 20:12:07 yeah
general 2021-02-27 20:12:17 think of it like mathematical communism
general 2021-02-27 20:12:22 everybody works together to make it work
general 2021-02-27 20:12:32 and if everybody works together, it is a very good system
general 2021-02-27 20:12:45 no, you arent allowed to not be useful
general 2021-02-27 20:12:55 the math prevents it
general 2021-02-27 20:13:23 no, more than physically
general 2021-02-27 20:13:28 MATHEMATICALLY
general 2021-02-27 20:13:31 the true absolute
general 2021-02-27 20:13:49 history is stinky
general 2021-02-27 20:14:22 planes too
general 2021-02-27 20:14:41 no speaking of the unfunny moustache man
general 2021-02-27 20:15:45 but im really proud of my learning function, i just fucked around trying things until it somehow showed signs of working and then i made a parameter tuner for it and now it can get any problem i give it 42% correct
general 2021-02-27 20:16:18 42% is good actually
general 2021-02-27 20:16:26 imagine if a human brain was 42% perfect
general 2021-02-27 20:16:56 if there was a human whos brain was 42% perfect they would be the scarriest mother fucker on the planet
general 2021-02-28 16:09:00 idk how, but my computer renders 400k blocks lagglessly
general 2021-02-28 16:09:04 
general 2021-02-28 16:10:23 no
general 2021-02-28 16:33:03 ayyy, my learning function just made an advancement
general 2021-02-28 16:33:15 it went from 42% successful to 44% successful
general 2021-02-28 16:33:36 2% increase is big especially after the effort it took
general 2021-02-28 16:33:52 and besides, its only been tuning for about an hour or two
general 2021-02-28 16:33:59 so more advancement to come
general 2021-02-28 16:34:12 imagine if i got it to 75% successful
general 2021-02-28 16:34:18 that would be fucking awesome
general 2021-02-28 16:34:25 100% successful probably never
general 2021-02-28 16:34:40 it might be possible
general 2021-02-28 16:34:55 but never perfect, since the method im using is definitely never going to manage to get perfect
general 2021-02-28 16:35:08 but if it gets to 75% successful that would be fucking amazing
general 2021-02-28 16:35:46 because from there i can scale it up and do all the structural wee woo wee woos and possibly make the worlds first general artificial intelligence
general 2021-02-28 16:36:10 which is just an AI that decides what it wants to learn
general 2021-02-28 16:36:20 wont be a very strong GAI but it will be the first
general 2021-02-28 16:37:14 probably someone has done this before or something like it so im likely not the first
general 2021-02-28 16:37:16 but im guessing
general 2021-02-28 16:37:34 since it took so much effort to get here and i doubt anybody other than me is dumb enough to try this method
general 2021-02-28 16:37:56 you have to be a certain type of stupid in order to invent stuff
general 2021-02-28 16:39:29 i cant wait to get the giant enemy spider working so i can move on to the monke machine
general 2021-02-28 16:39:41 monke machine
general 2021-02-28 16:39:58 imagine it figures out how to do monke flip
general 2021-02-28 17:13:04 btw who the fuck invented olives
general 2021-02-28 17:13:06 nastiest shit
general 2021-02-28 19:20:01 fun fact: in equations, c represents the speed of light BECAUSE it actually doesnt. it represents the speed of causality(same as the speed of light)

general 2021-03-01 15:48:04 ay ay ay
general 2021-03-01 15:48:32 my neural function thingy has gone up from 42% successful to 46% successful
general 2021-03-01 15:48:42 when it gets above 50% successful i will shit my pants :)
general 2021-03-01 15:58:38 i will invent new friends B)
general 2021-03-01 20:46:09 my dad accidentally got high moisture mozzarella :(
general 2021-03-01 20:46:30 tastes delicious and ill probably solo the entire 1 pound block this week but its useless for pizza :(
general 2021-03-01 20:46:37 cheddar-only pizzas for a while it seems
general 2021-03-01 22:38:41 i like how humans got so mad at natural selection for making our noses bad at working that we decided to design pugs specifically to be unable to breathe just to take revenge on nature
general 2021-03-01 22:38:49 nature will know our suffering
general 2021-03-02 12:02:32 google is cool
general 2021-03-02 12:02:54 they just give out free graphics cards(sorta) to whoever wants one
general 2021-03-02 12:03:37 but theyre data science GPUs and they dont run on your own computer so you cant use them for GAMING but you can use them to do data science
general 2021-03-02 12:03:41 which is very epic
general 2021-03-02 12:04:26 i mean you ***could***. if they actually sent you a physical GPU
general 2021-03-02 12:04:37 but they dont just send you a free GPU
general 2021-03-02 12:04:47 yes
general 2021-03-02 12:04:59 its called google CoLab
general 2021-03-02 12:05:11 its for data scientists who are too poor to get their own data science GPUs
general 2021-03-02 12:05:20 so google lets people borrow theirs
general 2021-03-02 12:05:22 which is epic
general 2021-03-02 13:00:31 im not a minor B)
general 2021-03-02 13:00:40 imagine being a loser minor
general 2021-03-02 13:01:19 no matter where you go on the internet the server will be full of minors
general 2021-03-02 13:01:25 just dont do anything illegal and i would call it fine
general 2021-03-02 13:01:30 or creepy
general 2021-03-02 13:02:09 liability
general 2021-03-02 13:02:12 oh
general 2021-03-02 13:02:56 well many actual ***illegals*** get away with it, so as long as you do nothing remotely creepy as you should, you should be fine
general 2021-03-02 13:03:25 i already sent feet pics
general 2021-03-02 13:05:54 my neural network learning function has gotten 6.6% better :)
general 2021-03-02 13:06:49 im adding more parameter stuff for the tuner to ***tune*** so maybe this tuning run will be the one where success gets >50%
general 2021-03-02 13:07:29 no, thats a job for the monke machine
general 2021-03-02 13:07:33 whenever i get around to it
general 2021-03-02 13:07:44 which will be after i get the giant enemy spider working
general 2021-03-02 13:08:27 yeah i was about to send that video
general 2021-03-02 13:08:37 thats what inspired me to create the giant enemy spider

general 2021-03-02 21:47:39 yes
general 2021-03-02 21:48:06 and cheddar. not the dumb stuff thats dyed orange in america thats garbage. actual BRI-ISH cheddar

general 2021-03-03 14:41:18 anyways my learning function thingy is now 47% successful
general 2021-03-03 14:41:25 getting so close to the >50% mark
general 2021-03-03 14:42:41 would be cool if it could get to the 100% success mark but i doubt ill manage that
general 2021-03-03 14:43:09 but if i do then creating the learning function is only the beginning. next thing i need to do is actually create the brain structure

general 2021-03-03 15:33:35 for terrorism
general 2021-03-03 15:33:50 and i was the judge because thats fair
general 2021-03-03 15:34:20 so they start fucking around, and dig into the ground. i send the guard in after them to get them back out and literally none of them say anything
general 2021-03-03 15:34:25 they get back out and we continue
general 2021-03-03 15:34:48 they go into the ground again after a while and then i run over to try to get them out and just before i manage to go down into their hole
general 2021-03-03 15:35:02 the entire court house just fucking explodes and all of my friends are dead
general 2021-03-03 15:35:51 words cant describe the horror of that day
general 2021-03-03 15:36:47 the worst part is that the french arent even the ones that placed the bomb
general 2021-03-03 15:36:54 it was my friend who was suing the french
general 2021-03-03 15:37:07 and the french, and the guard, saying nothing just run into the bomb and blow up the entire court house
general 2021-03-03 16:13:23 yooOOOOo

general 2021-03-03 18:55:15 i think children are lame
general 2021-03-03 18:55:42 and because i think children are lame, i believe we should open the schools so that they die
general 2021-03-03 18:56:32 anybody younger than 18, but middle school and elementary schools should have covid19 patients sent to them explicitly to allow more to die
general 2021-03-03 18:56:59 yes but im not anymore
general 2021-03-03 18:57:04 that is fine
general 2021-03-03 18:57:06 you are all stinky
general 2021-03-03 18:57:08 die

general 2021-03-03 18:57:24 i turned 18
general 2021-03-03 18:57:42 fuck the children in a metaphorical sense
general 2021-03-03 18:57:44 kill
general 2021-03-03 18:58:18 people die because its not genetically advantageous to live forever

general 2021-03-03 18:58:36 you die and you end
general 2021-03-03 18:59:00 and yes, in order to let less people die we should kill the children by sending them back to school
general 2021-03-03 19:00:00 kill the children before overpopulation kills us

general 2021-03-03 21:35:49 no, but i did
general 2021-03-03 21:36:19 besides buddy man im probably the third oldest person in this server
general 2021-03-03 21:36:58 luckies

general 2021-03-03 21:37:19 probably the best country
general 2021-03-03 21:37:40 and cool government
general 2021-03-03 21:38:46 anyways yeah either there was an earthquake or something fucking exploded again
general 2021-03-03 21:38:56 because that was a big shakey shakey
general 2021-03-03 21:39:33 FutureDaddy
general 2021-03-03 21:41:37 so whats the "jesus christ" of astonishment for
general 2021-03-03 21:42:00 oh
general 2021-03-03 21:42:10 im glad its getting warm again
general 2021-03-03 21:42:14 i think my tree will be happy
general 2021-03-03 21:51:26 poop
general 2021-03-03 21:51:44 but yeah i really wonder that that was
general 2021-03-03 21:51:52 i didnt hear an explosion but i felt wigglies
general 2021-03-03 21:52:11 do local news stations exist
general 2021-03-03 21:56:07 the american people are tired of women
the-dump 2021-03-03 22:09:05 
general 2021-03-03 23:07:11 .6% away from >50% on my learning function
general 2021-03-03 23:07:17 its is going to get super funky
general 2021-03-03 23:07:23 B)
general 2021-03-03 23:07:23 pro
general 2021-03-03 23:08:15 the learning function is super duper complicated and spaghetti-y, but the parameter tuner is super simple actually, ill show you in a sec
general 2021-03-03 23:08:39 the function made 7% progress in the last day, so its actually going really really fast
general 2021-03-03 23:14:00 heres what it looks like basically:
```lua
local currentParameters={1,1,1,1,1,1} --the parameters that need to be tuned
local parameterCounter=0
local bestParameters={nil,-1000} --initialize the best parameters
repeat
  local score=Test(currentParameters) --tests the current parameters to see how well they do
  if score>bestParameters[2] then
    bestParameters={currentParameters,score}
  end
  parameterCounter=parameterCounter+1
  currentParameters=bestParameters[1]
  currentParameters[parameterCounter]=currentParameters[parameterCounter]+random(-1,1)
  if parameterCounter>=#currentParameters then
    parameterCounter=0
  end
until nil```

general 2021-03-03 23:14:32 roblox studio :)
general 2021-03-03 23:14:41 mk
general 2021-03-03 23:14:54 sure, if you try hard enough
general 2021-03-03 23:14:59 neural networks
general 2021-03-03 23:15:21 wrong
general 2021-03-03 23:15:23 all wrong
general 2021-03-03 23:15:28 im making THE GIANT ENEMY SPIDER
general 2021-03-03 23:15:48 does it look like i make pretty code
general 2021-03-03 23:16:07 im liar
general 2021-03-03 23:16:39 also no my code is garbage lmao
general 2021-03-03 23:16:53 i dont really make code that other people will look at often and i can understand it perfectly fine
general 2021-03-03 23:17:03 whenever i ask my friend something he bullies me for how ugly my code is lmao
general 2021-03-03 23:17:56 anyways i fixed a bug with the learning function that made it so that neurons cant explore at all if they are on and off perfectly equally
general 2021-03-03 23:18:08 so i think the learning function will make a LOT of progress
general 2021-03-03 23:19:54 the new tuning session has only been going on for about 10 minutes but im still gonna check it out anyways, i have to switch to my second computer since i have a second computer specifically for my little AI projects since that one has a strong CPU, but this one has a graphics card so i can GAME
general 2021-03-03 23:21:09 back
general 2021-03-03 23:21:29 i make it print the parameters and i copy and paste the parameters into the code :)
general 2021-03-03 23:21:34 anyways yeah gotta head out
general 2021-03-03 23:21:38 oh epic
general 2021-03-03 23:21:40 anyways cya
general 2021-03-03 23:22:03 so i can keep multiple versions just in case theres a bug or something fucks up or for references
general 2021-03-03 23:22:11 also so i can see exactly what the parameters are doing
general 2021-03-03 23:22:27 since the parameters are by default all positive one
general 2021-03-03 23:22:35 so when they go all the way around to being negative its interesting
general 2021-03-03 23:22:46 and i wanna see why
general 2021-03-03 23:22:50 yeah
general 2021-03-03 23:23:43 cya
general 2021-03-03 23:23:43 anyways yeah gotta head out now
general 2021-03-04 01:26:19 well, despite my learning function only getting half the questions right and then giving those same answers for the other questions, IM STILL IMPRESSED that it gets half of the questions perfectly right
general 2021-03-04 01:27:20 the questions are kinda complex so its impressive to me at least, but the bias shifting part of the function is definitely going to need some work, since if a neuron is on half the time and off half the time the bias gets stuck which causes the network to not be able to shift around and search for new answers as effectively
general 2021-03-04 01:27:37 so that neuron has to rely on weight connections to change in order to find new answers
general 2021-03-04 01:27:56 but even those can get stuck if the network gets stagnant for some reason
general 2021-03-04 01:28:07 so yeah the bias is gonna need to be fixed
general 2021-03-04 01:28:09 uhhHH
general 2021-03-04 01:28:15 hmm let me figure out how i would do that
general 2021-03-04 01:28:57 well a neuron is just like a circle that does weird stuff with numbers
general 2021-03-04 01:29:37 the numbers that it does weird stuff with depend on connections between itself and another neuron, and what that connection describes
general 2021-03-04 01:30:24 so if the neuron and the neuron that its connected to agree a lot, the connection will be positive, meaning this neuron will be more likely to be turned on if the neuron its connected to is on
general 2021-03-04 01:31:05 if this neuron and the neuron it is connected to disagree a lot, the connection will be negative, so this neuron will be less like to be activated if the neuron its connected to is activated
general 2021-03-04 01:31:40 the bias is super duper complicated but the best way i can describe it is:
general 2021-03-04 01:31:52 well a neuron is a function, like f(x)
general 2021-03-04 01:32:08 and f(x)=mx+b, "b" is the BIAS
general 2021-03-04 01:33:01 a bias is basically a guaranteed number given to the neuron, so if the bias is more positive, this neuron will be more likely to activate more often
general 2021-03-04 01:33:11 if it is negative, this neuron is less likely to activate
general 2021-03-04 01:34:06 and what a learning function does is it decides how the weights(the connections to other neurons) and the biases should change in order to achieve a higher score or something like that
general 2021-03-04 01:34:48 the most common learning function is backpropagation, but i couldnt get it to work so im inventing my own learning function
general 2021-03-04 01:35:04 with backpropagation you have to tell the neural network the answer you want out of it
general 2021-03-04 01:35:11 with MY function you just have to tell it how good it did
general 2021-03-04 01:35:36 no, nononono not at all
general 2021-03-04 01:35:41 yeah
general 2021-03-04 01:35:56 if you tell it the score, its like calling a dog a good boy
general 2021-03-04 01:36:14 if you tell it the answer, its like doing a backflip to show your dog that you want it to do a backflip
general 2021-03-04 01:36:57 its a lot easier to tell something that it did good than it is to show it exactly what you want it to do
general 2021-03-04 01:37:03 and a lot more versatile
general 2021-03-04 01:37:25 i forgot what i was going to say after explaining what a neural network is
general 2021-03-04 01:37:55 what does lightning have to do with machine learning
general 2021-03-04 01:38:45 anyways i think i was going to explain how my learning function works
general 2021-03-04 01:39:18 ill be honest im not ENTIRELY sure how since i just had random ideas and threw them in the function until it somehow worked one day and i've been working frm there
general 2021-03-04 01:41:02 but basically every time the network is run, the neuron looks at the other neurons it is connected to, and if the score is good, it connects more positively to neurons that are activated as well, and connects more negatively to neurons it disagrees with
general 2021-03-04 01:41:23 pretty simple for the weight adjustments
general 2021-03-04 01:42:21 but the bias is where the really funky stuff comes in despite how you would think it would be the lamer of the two things(weights and biases) since it only deals with this neuron, not this neuron's relationship to other neurons
general 2021-03-04 01:43:31 basically it moves in the opposite direction to how this neuron most commonly acts, meaning if it is almost always on, the bias will go more negative to try to make the neuron more deviant
general 2021-03-04 01:44:25 then i added a bunch of other things to the bias changing function and honestly its gotten so arcane that at this point im not entirely sure whats going on there
general 2021-03-04 01:45:09 but basically the bias's job is to allow the neuron to explore more in hopes of finding a better answer, so it DOESNT get stuck on a specific output like it currently is
general 2021-03-04 01:45:18 precisely why i describe the bias as broken :)
general 2021-03-04 01:45:26 though i think i fixed it a little
general 2021-03-04 11:07:10 smonky
general 2021-03-04 11:07:42 wait wheres the racism
general 2021-03-04 11:07:54 oh
general 2021-03-04 11:55:31 big monke
general 2021-03-04 11:57:30 wait china existed in world war 2?
general 2021-03-04 11:57:39 damn i should have paid attention in history class
general 2021-03-04 11:57:54 idiot country
general 2021-03-04 11:57:58 imagine getting bullied by weebs
general 2021-03-04 11:58:26 proves my point that they are an idiot country
general 2021-03-04 11:58:36 were*
general 2021-03-04 11:58:47 now theyre part of the cool kids club
general 2021-03-04 11:58:53 everywhere is seen by cameras
the-dump 2021-03-04 12:43:30 ages 3-99
the-dump 2021-03-04 12:44:15 anyways i got a leaked model of the upcoming roblox concert for that one fucking boy band
the-dump 2021-03-04 13:25:44 monke kill
general 2021-03-04 17:21:53 AIGHT so i fixed the problem where the learning function would get stuck on knowing half the answers perfectly and knowing the other half not at all
general 2021-03-04 17:22:30 basically i made it so that neurons with lower average scores search more than neurons with higher average scores
general 2021-03-04 17:22:40 it allows greater neuron firing diversity
general 2021-03-04 17:23:07 and also obviously neurons with lower scores need to experiment more to hopefully find a better answer
general 2021-03-04 17:23:31 so now that thats done its gotten worse! but im just gonna throw it in the tuner until it gets better again
general 2021-03-04 17:23:40 but the diversity is up where i want it
general 2021-03-04 17:23:42 so thats good
general 2021-03-04 17:24:00 you're stinky
general 2021-03-04 17:24:09 im creating racial diversity
general 2021-03-04 17:24:53 as long as you dont see a black dude in a movie and immediately think "damn, forced diversity" then you're fine
general 2021-03-04 17:25:14 for the problem that im making it solve
general 2021-03-04 17:25:36 basically
general 2021-03-04 17:25:40 whatever pattern i show it
general 2021-03-04 17:25:46 randomized pattern that it has to memorize :)
general 2021-03-04 17:43:22 hey
general 2021-03-04 17:43:39 capitalism is so epic that i think we should invent SUPER capitalism
general 2021-03-04 17:43:46 where private ownership is so important that all of the workers collectively own the business that they work at
general 2021-03-04 17:44:33 sweden has planes?
general 2021-03-04 17:44:50 i thought all sweden had was vikings
general 2021-03-04 17:44:56 like catapaults and stuff
general 2021-03-04 17:45:20 wait so its not just vikings?
general 2021-03-04 17:45:25 fucking lame
general 2021-03-04 17:45:30 i thought sweden was cool
general 2021-03-04 17:45:51 i was considering going there to take part in pillaging english settlements
general 2021-03-04 17:46:24 well i guess you wont fucking like sweden then
general 2021-03-04 17:46:25 idiots
general 2021-03-04 17:46:42 because they used to be totally badass and pillaged england
general 2021-03-04 17:46:50 now apparently theyre just lame-ass grenade people
general 2021-03-04 17:46:58 i know
general 2021-03-04 17:47:02 i figured that out today
general 2021-03-04 17:47:23 hmm
general 2021-03-04 17:47:28 i like that idea
general 2021-03-04 17:48:30 loser
general 2021-03-04 20:25:48 ayyy https://gyazo.com/bd987905a473cc4cff7d2e93c0be283f
general 2021-03-04 20:26:01 i fixed the neuron activation variety with my latest change
general 2021-03-04 20:26:15 its still dumb
general 2021-03-04 20:26:46 but i think after enough tuning, the learning function will get a lot better at moving towards block
general 2021-03-04 20:27:05 the neuron activations are up in the upper left corner btw
general 2021-03-04 20:27:10 small brain for now for fast tuning
general 2021-03-04 20:27:38 but the neuron activation variety is absolutely fixed, which is very very good
general 2021-03-04 20:27:55 har har
the-dump 2021-03-04 22:06:55 i wish i could use duolingo for sign language
general 2021-03-05 01:21:39 i have decided that whenever i figure out the giant enemy spider, my next project will be the small enemy turtle
general 2021-03-05 01:21:49 then after that it will be the monke machine
general 2021-03-05 19:17:40 imagine if companies profited based on how much stuff they sell rather than how expensive the stuff they sell is
general 2021-03-05 19:17:46 that would be kinda epic
general 2021-03-05 19:17:55 rtx graphics cards could be sold for like $20
general 2021-03-05 19:18:59 who cares about grammar as long as you convey the information effectively
general 2021-03-05 19:20:42 well i gave up my little community that i owned for a while, so maybe now that my freetime-hands are free, ill apply to be mod
general 2021-03-05 19:20:44 maybe
general 2021-03-05 19:21:07 duh
general 2021-03-05 19:21:19 cant apply for mod if applications arent open
general 2021-03-05 19:21:22 mr obvious smh
general 2021-03-05 19:21:39 but yeah im not hell bent on becoming a mod here

general 2021-03-06 14:59:45 no
general 2021-03-06 15:00:53 im retuning my learning function so that it gets all the questions at least half right instead of half the questions fully right
general 2021-03-06 15:01:48 i think it will manage to do better, since previously it would get stuck on half right and wouldnt be able to figure out the other problems

general 2021-03-08 17:48:42 i do
general 2021-03-08 17:48:44 but no
general 2021-03-08 17:48:54 anyways i reset the fucking uh
general 2021-03-08 17:48:57 learning shit
general 2021-03-08 17:49:19 because it was being stupid and i changed some things so now its back to like 35% successful
general 2021-03-08 17:49:26 no its a good thing
general 2021-03-08 17:49:29 it had a problem
general 2021-03-08 17:49:43 and i changed it so now hopefully it will be able to get stronger
general 2021-03-08 17:50:08 also maybe some day ill just make a new learning function
general 2021-03-08 17:50:41 where each neuron looks both ahead and behind it instead of only ahead of it in order to figure out how it should change
general 2021-03-08 17:52:55 what thing?
general 2021-03-08 17:53:16 wait what "thing" are you refering to
general 2021-03-08 17:54:50 it has to get each pattern at least half right before it gets any score for getting the rest of the pattern right
general 2021-03-08 17:56:08 previously it just got half of the patterns perfectly right(which was impressive ngl) and the other half of the questions not-wrong, so it was getting stuck at having 50% success and the only progress it could make was getting stuck at 50% successful earlier and earlier in the training cycle
general 2021-03-08 17:57:15 cant wait until parallel lua happens so that the tuning process can go way faster
general 2021-03-08 17:57:30 but for now it goes fast *enough*
general 2021-03-08 17:58:05 i've been tuning it for the last 3 days or something. it started off at 19% successful(probably closer to 10% successful if i set all the parameters back to their original default)
general 2021-03-08 17:58:23 but now its 35-36% successful so hey PROGRESS
general 2021-03-08 17:59:32 i give it 4 patterns that the network has to memorize and give the correct output for. i get the difference between the answer i wanted and the answer it gave and badda bing badda boom thats how successful it was for that learning cycle
general 2021-03-08 18:00:38 its probably best i dont explain too much though
general 2021-03-08 18:01:23 anyways im making pasta bye
general 2021-03-08 18:01:34 macaroni rather
general 2021-03-08 18:01:37 its a tastier shape
general 2021-03-08 20:12:38 dont bully the furries, theyre only slightly worse than average so who cares
general 2021-03-08 20:13:21 eh
general 2021-03-08 20:13:33 its all just brain inside a meat machine to me
general 2021-03-08 20:13:46 oh
general 2021-03-08 20:13:51 thats fine
general 2021-03-08 20:14:18 just dont go around saying "owo *notices #####" and we will be fine
general 2021-03-08 20:14:35 precisely
general 2021-03-08 20:15:18 because you're a noob
general 2021-03-08 20:15:27 you're given a life so that you can do something with it
general 2021-03-08 20:16:03 lmao i graduated high school so i have the choice to not go to college until i get my vaccine
general 2021-03-08 20:16:06 stupid kids
general 2021-03-08 20:16:11 *joking*
the-dump 2021-03-08 20:16:26 
the-dump 2021-03-08 20:16:27 apology video
general 2021-03-08 20:17:19 btw do european countries get vaccines yet or is the US stealing them all first
general 2021-03-08 20:18:05 very noice
general 2021-03-08 20:18:14 i still have to wait 2 months
general 2021-03-08 20:18:42 im pretty much at the bottom of the list since i have the ability to stay at home until vaccines are available
general 2021-03-08 20:18:57 and i dont have some mental illness that makes me not want to wear a mask
general 2021-03-08 20:19:57 i graduated in 2020 so i only had to deal with like 2-3 months of online school B)
general 2021-03-08 20:20:38 im not legally required to go, so im waiting for my vaccine before starting college
general 2021-03-08 20:20:44 B)
general 2021-03-08 20:20:58 just be born earlier
general 2021-03-08 20:20:59 its easy
general 2021-03-08 20:21:02 yes
general 2021-03-08 20:21:19 i honestly was expecting to have 2 but then it turns out vaccines happened earlier so thats cool
general 2021-03-08 20:21:38 lmao i had an average grade of c
general 2021-03-08 20:21:43 i was a terrible student
general 2021-03-08 20:21:53 yes, and i passed on time
general 2021-03-08 20:21:56 anyways gotta go
general 2021-03-08 20:21:58 cya
general 2021-03-08 20:22:20 zoomer
general 2021-03-08 23:21:07 just got back from a HIKE
general 2021-03-08 23:21:13 just took off da 🅱️OOTS
general 2021-03-08 23:21:18 feet feel nice
general 2021-03-08 23:21:38 hawaii?
general 2021-03-08 23:21:40 sure
general 2021-03-08 23:22:00 mt rainier is an active volcano actually
general 2021-03-08 23:22:06 i would vibe and hike mt rainier
general 2021-03-09 00:03:38 Cats are vibe creatures
general 2021-03-09 00:03:42 they just eat, drink, scream, sleep
general 2021-03-09 00:03:57 yeah sometimes that
general 2021-03-09 00:04:09 they also defend themselves from annoying people on occasion
general 2021-03-09 00:04:23 violently
general 2021-03-09 00:11:27 the neural learning function just hit 37.5% successful. but i think that the closer the success gets to 50%, the noisier it will get until after some point after 50% it will get less noisy and more generalizing
general 2021-03-09 00:13:24 it will take some time for the function to get close enough to 50% for noise to start being an issue though, and any increase in success rate is obviously epic
general 2021-03-09 00:13:47 besides i can just add more test-networks in order to reduce the effect of noise as it reaches 50%
general 2021-03-09 11:46:34 i like how the games thumbnail is "1 million visits. Thats just plane crazy!" when the game now has over 100 million visits
general 2021-03-09 11:47:23 well duh its old
general 2021-03-09 11:47:42 cool
general 2021-03-09 12:17:53 i use microsoft edge
general 2021-03-09 12:18:03 because chrome is bad at playing videos :(
general 2021-03-09 12:18:15 i use tor for the illegal stuff though
general 2021-03-09 12:18:58 and yes, chrome sucks at playing videos(at least for me). the videos are all choppy and annoying
general 2021-03-09 12:19:16 well your computer is dumb
general 2021-03-09 12:19:22 i have a decently good device
general 2021-03-09 12:19:36 i have a graphics card, and a cpu that works
general 2021-03-09 12:19:42 no i dont live in hawaii
general 2021-03-09 12:20:12 i have 16 gb so ram aint the issue
general 2021-03-09 12:20:59 i wish i could say i was an epic gamer, but i just use my graphics card for data science
general 2021-03-09 12:21:22 i have plans to use it for neural networks SOME DAY but until i stop being lazy, i just use it to run tests for an open source project
general 2021-03-09 12:21:53 i would recommend contributing to folding@home if you have a graphics card that isnt doing anything currently
general 2021-03-09 12:22:24 folding@home is a protein folder, where they simulate protein folding in order to find cures for diseases(like covid)
general 2021-03-09 12:22:32 not vaccines, but actual cures like antivirals
general 2021-03-09 12:22:34 its pretty epic
general 2021-03-09 12:23:25 im not contributing to folding@home though, im contributing to something called Leela Chess Zero because why tf not
general 2021-03-09 12:23:52 its an artificial intelligence for playing chess and its currently the second strongest chess engine in the world, and catching up to the first
general 2021-03-09 12:24:43 very epic
general 2021-03-09 12:25:25 folding@home is cool where it only takes up *excess* graphics card computing power. so if you're running a very GPU-intensive game, it will barely run at all so your game isnt any laggier than it normally would be
general 2021-03-09 12:26:07 yeah
general 2021-03-09 12:26:27 though it also only uses excess CPU power but if you have cooling issues then i would see the problem
general 2021-03-09 12:27:09 oh
general 2021-03-09 12:28:06 well to turn off CPU usage, just search up "fah control" on your computer and it will open a control panel wher eyou can do some funky shit
general 2021-03-09 12:28:51 epic
general 2021-03-09 12:29:55 so far my neural learning function has made a total of 18.6% progress, for a total of 37.6% total success
general 2021-03-09 12:29:58 pretty cool
general 2021-03-09 12:30:10 and as it gets better it opens up new opportunity stuff for it to tune
general 2021-03-09 12:30:18 yeah
general 2021-03-09 12:30:23 its called the giant enemy spider
general 2021-03-09 12:30:57 well his legal name is StephenSpiderZero, but his nickname is The Giant Enemy Spider
general 2021-03-09 12:31:24 you can probably find some already
general 2021-03-09 12:32:06 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAoDgCF-feg
general 2021-03-09 12:43:19 i need to make some bone juice
general 2021-03-09 12:43:24 what the
general 2021-03-09 12:43:45 its just juice you get when you boil vones
general 2021-03-09 12:43:50 its very tasty
general 2021-03-09 12:43:55 and probably has calcium or something
general 2021-03-09 12:44:02 my bones need bone juice
general 2021-03-09 12:44:15 yeah i know how to prevent it from turning into bone hurting juice
general 2021-03-09 12:44:23 smh milk
general 2021-03-09 12:44:31 i already drink a ton of milk in tea
general 2021-03-09 12:44:58 but yeah my body seems like its dumb
general 2021-03-09 12:45:15 pretty sure my neurons are slowly dying because my feet and hands have gotten twitchier recently
general 2021-03-09 12:45:37 yeah im packed full of diseases lmao
general 2021-03-09 12:45:55 steal
general 2021-03-09 12:46:25 buddy man just stop trying to break the rules
general 2021-03-09 12:46:32 uh oh
general 2021-03-09 12:46:35 he bypassed the filter
general 2021-03-09 12:46:39 thats unfunny
general 2021-03-09 12:46:46 <@!273536574770380800> he did the illegal
general 2021-03-09 12:47:41 very epic
general 2021-03-09 12:47:45 thank you mr mod man
general 2021-03-09 12:47:54 the mods in this discord are cool
general 2021-03-09 12:47:56 vibe creatures
general 2021-03-09 12:48:35 i mean he literally bypassed filter
general 2021-03-09 12:49:18 i remember when i got my inventor role removed because my status was "Playing: Roblox: Fuck Bitches edition"
general 2021-03-09 12:50:01 yup
general 2021-03-09 12:50:06 maybe
general 2021-03-09 12:50:11 actually im not sure if that was the reason
general 2021-03-09 12:50:24 i think one of my memes had unfunny moustache man in it
general 2021-03-09 12:50:48 god DAMN dude
general 2021-03-09 12:51:00 literally like 10 times within 5 minutes
general 2021-03-09 12:51:46 i use imperial but only when i know there are europeans around
general 2021-03-09 12:51:53 they shall not know the forbidden knowledge
general 2021-03-09 12:52:21 idk how hot my gpu is
general 2021-03-09 12:52:28 but its probably WAY hotter than yours
general 2021-03-09 12:52:32 because everything i own is SUPER hot
general 2021-03-09 12:53:06 yeah obc does that sometimes
general 2021-03-09 12:53:08 its how it is
general 2021-03-09 12:53:18 oh boy its nearly 5 am
general 2021-03-09 12:53:22 the sun will be up soon
general 2021-03-09 12:53:44 no, i woke up like 3 hours ago
general 2021-03-09 12:54:09 i go to bed at 5 and wake up at 2
general 2021-03-09 12:54:27 its surprisingly pleasant
general 2021-03-09 12:54:36 i get the quiet hours of teh day to myself
general 2021-03-09 12:54:43 and im most productive when its dark
general 2021-03-09 12:54:48 about .2 years
general 2021-03-09 12:55:35 but i think best and work best at night so i made my sleep schedule optimised for when i work best
general 2021-03-09 12:55:50 and im awake for all hours of sunrise too
general 2021-03-09 12:55:57 and go to bed right when the sun goes down
general 2021-03-09 12:56:00 so hey pretty epic
general 2021-03-09 12:56:09 does it LOOK like i own a camera
general 2021-03-09 12:56:34 does it LOOK like i care enough to go get my phone from my room
general 2021-03-09 12:56:51 no i need bone juice
general 2021-03-09 12:56:58 but i have no bones to make bone juice out of
general 2021-03-09 12:57:28 actually wait i think i do have bones to make bone juice with
general 2021-03-09 12:57:32 lmao nice
general 2021-03-09 12:57:47 only took about 10 infractions before the infraction rule happened
general 2021-03-09 12:58:02 chicken bones are fuggin lame. 🅱️eef is where its at
general 2021-03-09 12:58:55 when i make a chicken pot pie i get a full chicken, cut off the white meat and throw everything else in the water and then use that broth stuff to make sauce for the pie
general 2021-03-09 12:59:01 it tastes pretty good
general 2021-03-09 12:59:36 cant use all of the broth though or else it becomes basically chicken flavoring where a spoon full of pie is enough to make an entire plate of chicken-tasting food
general 2021-03-09 12:59:44 smh weeb
general 2021-03-09 13:00:15 march 17
general 2021-03-09 13:00:31 good fucking luck with my cat
general 2021-03-09 13:01:02 smh racism is only cool when ***I*** do it
general 2021-03-09 13:01:28 mm
general 2021-03-09 13:02:03 everyone its a woman, act natural
general 2021-03-09 13:03:00 smh <@!273536574770380800> we got another stinker
general 2021-03-09 13:04:38 brb im gonna see if i have bones
general 2021-03-09 13:04:52 i would hope they were broken
general 2021-03-09 13:04:58 because then i couldnt make bone juice out of them
general 2021-03-09 13:05:44 i dont have bones :(
general 2021-03-09 13:56:10 smile dog was a cool creepypasta
general 2021-03-09 13:56:29 i wasnt expecting the image and i was reading it at night so when i scrolled down and the image was there i got pretty spooked
general 2021-03-09 13:56:34 felt like i was moving backwards
general 2021-03-09 13:56:35 was epic
general 2021-03-09 13:56:48 yes yes
general 2021-03-09 13:56:54 ive already seent is jackie
general 2021-03-09 13:57:09 real
general 2021-03-09 13:57:24 probably unnecessarily spooked like 3 children though
general 2021-03-09 14:01:03 socialism is kinda epic
general 2021-03-09 14:01:12 but its political so at the same time unepic :(
general 2021-03-09 16:50:08 i dont mean to offend any 🅱️ritish people, but prince filip looks like he died a week ago
general 2021-03-09 16:50:44 because i think things. and i must say
general 2021-03-09 16:50:50 its how it works
general 2021-03-09 16:51:01 youir
general 2021-03-09 16:52:09 when i see gorl i think "damn. we're equal"
general 2021-03-09 16:52:28 i was talking to my dad about how the breakfast was epic
general 2021-03-09 16:52:44 :(
general 2021-03-09 16:52:51 oh fuck its the rabbit
general 2021-03-09 16:52:53 act natural
general 2021-03-09 16:54:38 you're only allowed to be toxic in DMs
general 2021-03-09 16:54:40 i think
general 2021-03-09 16:55:39 how many warns do i have
general 2021-03-09 16:55:43 im a very bad boy
general 2021-03-09 16:55:45 i had like
general 2021-03-09 16:55:46 3 warns
general 2021-03-09 16:55:48 B)
general 2021-03-09 16:56:07 yeah
general 2021-03-09 16:56:08 very toxic
general 2021-03-09 16:56:38 man ya'll're noobs
general 2021-03-09 16:56:40 just calm down
general 2021-03-09 20:23:25 good news
general 2021-03-09 20:23:28 i have bones after all
general 2021-03-09 20:23:36 now to make bone juice
general 2021-03-09 20:23:40 fuckin delicious
general 2021-03-09 20:23:55 bone juice is bone flavored jello
general 2021-03-09 20:24:32 milk is liquid bone but milk kinda sucks a little bit on its own
general 2021-03-09 20:24:49 i have to add sugar to make it something i would just drink normally
general 2021-03-09 20:32:34 bone juice is probably haram
general 2021-03-09 20:32:45 wait was it beef or pig that muslims dont eat
general 2021-03-09 20:33:21 i forgot contests existed
general 2021-03-09 20:33:33 i stopped looking at them because they were all lame-ass aesthetic builds and stuff
general 2021-03-09 20:33:50 nothing that actually accomplishes a feat
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:36:25 !role contests
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:36:31 !join contests
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:36:34 smh
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:36:38 whats the thing
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:40:41 i doubt <#609442446249820211> will tell me how to get the contest role
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:40:58 since <#609442446249820211> is usually just for stuff you earn from contests or building stuff
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:41:16 in fact i looked and it said nothing
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:41:58 OOOH
bot-central 2021-03-09 20:41:59 thanks
general 2021-03-09 20:43:03 <#504718138399522832> fuckin COCKPITS are winning?
general 2021-03-09 20:44:05 at least if its helicopters i can do something cool
general 2021-03-09 20:44:19 since i dont do aesthetic builds, i build things that get a job done
general 2021-03-09 20:44:41 helicopter better win
general 2021-03-09 20:44:54 what am i supposed to do with COCKPIT
general 2021-03-09 20:45:01 theres nothign cool i can do
general 2021-03-09 20:45:13 with helicopters i can at least make an actual working single-prop heli
general 2021-03-09 20:45:49 i at first voted for amphibious vehicles but then changed
general 2021-03-09 20:45:50 :(
general 2021-03-09 22:57:11 im like
general 2021-03-09 22:57:14 5 foot something

general 2021-03-12 21:57:15 life is going down hill :(
general 2021-03-12 21:57:52 i needed parallel lua in order to speed up the tuning speed of the giant enemy spider's learning function
general 2021-03-12 21:58:22 since now it takes 3 days to do a statistically significant tuning run
general 2021-03-12 21:58:28 i needed parallel lua to speed up that bitch

general 2021-03-13 10:20:30 Lol noob
general 2021-03-13 10:20:50 Idk how to invest in roblox
general 2021-03-13 10:20:52 B)
general 2021-03-13 10:22:53 Crypto
general 2021-03-13 10:22:58 Dah hell
general 2021-03-13 10:23:12 You don't need a crypto wallet to invest
general 2021-03-13 10:23:28 Roblox ain't a crypto currency
general 2021-03-13 10:25:10 Just do whatever the new york stock exchange tells you you need to do and badda bing badda boom you are roblock investor
general 2021-03-13 10:25:47 That's why you invest all your money into roblox
general 2021-03-13 10:25:55 So kids don't steal your credit card
general 2021-03-13 10:26:03 Ez solution
general 2021-03-13 10:26:38 What's el problemo
general 2021-03-13 10:30:06 If they haven't finished elementary school, yeah
general 2021-03-13 10:32:17 Honestly I think doing math is a good way to strengthen your thonking ability
general 2021-03-13 10:33:05 Since you have to do all of these complex interactions in your head, and when you manage to do it right your brain rewards you strengthening those connections
general 2021-03-13 10:34:15 If it's like 50 dollars then it's fine because they learn how stocks work
general 2021-03-13 10:41:54 Puzzle videogames maybe
general 2021-03-13 10:43:20 But fast games like shooters probably not since it's fast thinking, just input something and hen output something vaguely correct as soon as possible
general 2021-03-13 10:45:52 Well maybe shooters work, I just don't think of shooters as deep-thinking sorts of situations like iterative functions
general 2021-03-13 10:46:09 But I'm not ACTUALLY a gamer so maybe I'm not thinking the right way
general 2021-03-13 10:48:38 Also sleep a lot obviously, in my tests with the giant enemy spider AI, sleeping strengthened it's memory->memory connections(his CONSCIENCE if you want to call it that)
general 2021-03-13 10:48:47 And I think that could apply to humans
general 2021-03-13 10:49:56 It blocked out external sensory activations, so it's connections with its own internal activations strengthened
general 2021-03-13 10:50:54 Also didn't strengthen it's memory, it strengthened the flow of information inside it's brain
general 2021-03-13 10:51:30 I think sleeping is pretty similar. What do you experience while sleeping? Nothing except your own memories
general 2021-03-13 10:52:05 Dreams are literally your own memories except meshing together with what you experienced that day
general 2021-03-13 10:52:25 Yeah
general 2021-03-13 10:52:33 That's what the spider does while sleeping
general 2021-03-13 10:53:32 I only care about the neurological effects of sleeping
general 2021-03-13 10:54:03 I guess, except it's not voluntary for the spider
general 2021-03-13 10:54:32 I literally turn off all it's feelings and just make it think about it's memories and stuff and strengthen the connections
general 2021-03-13 10:54:47 Pretty much exactly what sleeping is
general 2021-03-13 10:56:48 Those dreams are made by old memories. Memories who's connections need to be activated in order to be out into the dream. If they aren't connected by the dream they are weakened since those memories are likely not needed
general 2021-03-13 10:58:05 Same with the spider. The spider doesn't experience those memories accurately his memories mesh together while dreaming.
general 2021-03-13 10:58:39 But the point of the sleeping is to activate those memories and then see which ones get activated and strengthen them
general 2021-03-13 10:59:12 No, they activate depending on what the spider experienced while it was awake
general 2021-03-13 10:59:57 It uses it's short term memory as the seed of it's dream and sees what memories get activated by that, and then as the dream progresses it might activate other memories
general 2021-03-13 11:00:53 Memories that don't get activated by dreams very often, or aren't activated while awake aren't very useful so they get forgotten and replaced with new memories
general 2021-03-13 11:01:45 I suppose, but that's the mechanism
general 2021-03-13 11:02:26 It's pretty much what it is, I can't find a difference between that and sleeping
general 2021-03-13 11:02:58 Honestly meditating can make dreams right?
general 2021-03-13 11:04:23 I make it stop moving too if that makes a difference to your interpretation
general 2021-03-13 11:04:55 I COULD make it keep moving but it would be deaf and blind
general 2021-03-13 11:05:35 But yeah I guess it is a little different from sleeping now that I think about it like that
general 2021-03-13 11:06:01 It would be like going blind and deaf and losing all senses but still being conscious
general 2021-03-13 11:06:16 But I'm not exactly sure what sleeping is then
general 2021-03-13 11:06:40 Yeah but wtf is conscience
general 2021-03-13 11:07:13 Dreams where you can move around and control yourself, you're pretty much conscious
general 2021-03-13 11:07:23 Just in an imagined environment
general 2021-03-13 11:09:03 Fact
general 2021-03-13 11:09:19 Jk I don't have a problem with weebs

general 2021-03-17 16:25:10 they should make it so that when vaccines become available, you are required to have the vaccine in order to be able to buy food
general 2021-03-17 16:25:24 that way people who cause more people to die will die themselves

general 2021-03-17 16:36:46 i mean vaccines become available for ALL the people
general 2021-03-17 16:36:54 yeah, vaccine side effect: die
general 2021-03-17 16:36:59 watch out for it
general 2021-03-17 16:37:18 i said when vaccines become available for all the people
general 2021-03-17 16:37:21 nobo
general 2021-03-17 16:38:03 besides even if one of the vaccines potential side effects was just immediately dropping dead, it would save more lives to take it than to not take it
general 2021-03-17 16:38:28 wait are you unironically an anti vaxer lmao
general 2021-03-17 16:38:54 good
general 2021-03-17 16:39:10 dummy
general 2021-03-17 16:39:29 even if 1 in 1000 people die from the vaccine, its safer than getting the actual virus
general 2021-03-17 16:39:50 wish it was that simple :(
general 2021-03-17 16:40:49 there are some people who will get the coronavirus and be like "lmao its just a bad cold" and go out to a public park or crowded game tournament
general 2021-03-17 17:07:12 isreal
general 2021-03-17 17:07:24 just set it on fire

general 2021-03-17 21:53:47 wait
general 2021-03-17 21:53:58 how do i illegally immigrate to the US when im already in the US
general 2021-03-17 22:03:12 aight i have this awesome idea
general 2021-03-17 22:03:16 i call it super capitalism
general 2021-03-17 22:03:43 its where we value individual ownership so much that each and every employee in a company owns part of that company and has a say in what it does
general 2021-03-17 22:03:48 super capitalism
general 2021-03-17 22:10:47 man
general 2021-03-17 22:11:15 have i ever told you guys about the time i almost became communist dictator of the school
general 2021-03-17 22:11:51 i brought acid to class in 6th grade
general 2021-03-17 22:12:12 very epic
general 2021-03-17 22:13:12 dream is stinky

general 2021-03-17 22:13:19 now
general 2021-03-18 00:26:31 i bet stinky europeans dont have giant enemy squirrels like the US
general 2021-03-18 00:26:40 
general 2021-03-18 00:26:42 this bitch
general 2021-03-18 00:27:55 fuck
general 2021-03-18 00:27:59 my dog is dirty as hell
general 2021-03-18 00:28:38 but yeah my city has giant enemy squirrels just vibing in and around the center of the city
general 2021-03-18 00:39:03 some day in the future i will create a robot fighting ring. i have 2 contestants in mind. the giant enemy spider, and big monke
general 2021-03-18 00:39:08 what should the third fighter be
general 2021-03-18 00:39:43 he will die every time so that wont get me money because it wont be exciting
general 2021-03-18 03:53:29 "im gonna kill all of you" has probably been said a lot more frequently ever since multiplayer games were invented
general 2021-03-18 03:53:32 checkmate zoomers
general 2021-03-18 05:19:17 political warning:

general 2021-03-18 09:11:06 I got 2 hours of sleep last night
general 2021-03-18 09:11:10 Feeling unepic
general 2021-03-18 09:14:43 I got blacklisted approximately NEVER
general 2021-03-18 09:14:45 Ooh yeah
general 2021-03-18 09:14:50 Flexed on
general 2021-03-18 09:19:27 Smh
general 2021-03-18 09:19:30 Real life
general 2021-03-18 09:19:54 No seen content
general 2021-03-18 09:19:59 Weeb*
general 2021-03-18 09:20:43 It has to do with feet and you know how weird people arr
general 2021-03-18 09:20:53 So yeah probably sus scene
general 2021-03-18 09:24:16 I wish I would receive die but I'm too good of a person for that
general 2021-03-18 09:24:19 Factual
general 2021-03-18 09:55:41 my cheese is so glorious that you need to upvote it before your other votes are considered valid
general 2021-03-18 09:55:44 its how it is
general 2021-03-18 09:56:04 yeah let me get the link
general 2021-03-18 09:56:35 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/776774067557761054
general 2021-03-18 09:57:15 low effort?
general 2021-03-18 09:57:17 what do you mean
general 2021-03-18 09:57:26 do you know how much effort i had to go through to make cheese flyable
general 2021-03-18 09:57:53 e
general 2021-03-18 09:58:50 but yeah it maneuvers like a fighter jet somehow. where its stable enough in flight that it doesnt flip all over the place but unstable enough where you can flip the entire thing backwards if you hold s for more than 1 second
general 2021-03-18 09:59:13 wasnt intentional its just a detail of being cheese
general 2021-03-18 10:00:34 idk it looks like a plane to me dawg
general 2021-03-18 10:01:42 and i got more upvotes on my cheese than those 2 combined
general 2021-03-18 10:01:47 jut shows you the glory of cheese i suppose
general 2021-03-18 10:02:08 i asked
general 2021-03-18 10:02:11 B)
general 2021-03-18 10:04:14 i wonder when the next update is
general 2021-03-18 10:04:18 and what it will be
general 2021-03-18 10:15:50 i got 2
general 2021-03-18 10:24:54 if its a big ceiling going over the whole place, its a dome
general 2021-03-18 10:24:55 its how it is
general 2021-03-18 10:25:09 no its earth game
general 2021-03-18 10:25:11 stinky
general 2021-03-18 11:27:06 everybody gangsta till the numbers start talking
general 2021-03-18 11:30:43 but yeah basically every sci fi novel that has robots in it
general 2021-03-18 13:33:03 i will kill all wasps, and so that we dont have a bug takeover due to the number one bug predator being gone, i will replace them with robotic wasps that dont kill people
general 2021-03-18 13:33:25 silence zoomer i joined roblox 12 years ago
general 2021-03-18 13:33:41 nice
general 2021-03-18 13:38:35 i have decided to do a second type of learning function
general 2021-03-18 13:38:40 this one will focus on memorization
general 2021-03-18 13:40:15 the first type of learning function focuses on getting the highest score with the given inputs, the second type of learning function focuses on creating neuron clusters that output yes or no whether or not they are seeing something that they were told to remember seeing
general 2021-03-18 13:40:25 duh
general 2021-03-18 13:41:07 honestly might not even need the first learning function if im SMORT enough and can jut figure out outputs based on memories
general 2021-03-18 13:41:08 yeah
general 2021-03-18 13:41:23 im going to create an AI boxing ring
general 2021-03-18 13:41:32 the giant enemy spider will fight the big monke
general 2021-03-18 13:41:37 and maybe a third ai later
general 2021-03-18 13:43:24 man i wish i could return to monke
general 2021-03-18 13:43:34 wouldnt need to worry about making the giant enemy spider
general 2021-03-18 14:23:17 the more tests that a class had, the better because i never ever ever did my homework
general 2021-03-18 14:23:31 i still passed high school on time though so thats epic
general 2021-03-18 14:24:08 trigonometry isnt difficult, its just sin, cos, tan, and triangles
general 2021-03-18 14:24:46 i am math man
general 2021-03-18 14:24:50 i make the numbers do as i please
general 2021-03-18 14:24:53 explain the question
general 2021-03-18 14:25:54 lmao sheeeeit
general 2021-03-18 14:26:05 uh well what is sin in
general 2021-03-18 14:26:10 i mean
general 2021-03-18 14:26:15 is it radians or degrees
general 2021-03-18 14:26:34 aight epic
general 2021-03-18 14:26:56 cos(x) is just sin(x+90) then
general 2021-03-18 14:27:01 i think hold on let me confirm
general 2021-03-18 14:28:01 yep thats right
general 2021-03-18 14:28:13 np
general 2021-03-18 14:30:30 no
general 2021-03-18 14:31:05 mmm im not entirely sure how to do that honestly
general 2021-03-18 14:31:30 there isnt?
general 2021-03-18 14:31:34 there should be
general 2021-03-18 14:32:20 i have no clue honestly
general 2021-03-18 20:59:32 my memorizing function is working pretty well so far, 82.6% successful
general 2021-03-18 20:59:54 honestly i want a bit of non-success so that memories get triggered by similar but not exact things
general 2021-03-18 21:00:02 no you're thinking of the learning function
general 2021-03-18 21:00:11 that ones still at 40% and is being tuned on my other computer
general 2021-03-18 21:00:26 this one creates memories that the learning function will use to determine how it should go about doing things
general 2021-03-18 21:07:37 but yeah how the memory clusters in the AI are going to work is that every time the brain determines something needs to be memorized, it can tie a value to it(negative for bad, positive for good) so that when the memory neuron cluster detects that it recognises something, it sends that value to the main network to tell it how bad things are going to be
general 2021-03-18 21:11:25 but yeah, the memorizing function was definitely a lot simpler for the tuner to tune than the learning function. this went from -27.3% successful to 83.4% successful in 1 hour and 50 minutes. while the learning function is about 40% successful after several weeks of tuning
general 2021-03-18 22:12:55 woah, the memory function scales really well. i increased the input size from 4 input neurons to 16 input neurons and it only got about 20% less accurate(for a total of 60% accuracy). i was honestly expecting it to flip back to -12% accurate but this is a pleasant surprise
general 2021-03-18 22:13:04 means i can have a variety of neuron cluster sizes
general 2021-03-18 22:13:39 into a neuron?
general 2021-03-18 22:13:46 well numbers are the input
general 2021-03-18 22:13:51 or are you asking what exactly a neuron is
general 2021-03-18 22:14:21 yeah but i mean, what do you mean
general 2021-03-18 22:14:22 oh
general 2021-03-18 22:14:35 sounded like you already had experience with neural networks but aighty
general 2021-03-18 22:15:49 basically, a neuron is just a function that gives an output for a specific input, and the input is the sum of all the weighted connections to other neurons
general 2021-03-18 22:16:11 a weighted connection, is just a number that is multiplied by the output of the neuron its connected to
general 2021-03-18 22:56:32 hehhehheehhhe
general 2021-03-18 22:57:01 memory function success rate just hit 69%
general 2021-03-19 09:01:16 Fucking
general 2021-03-19 09:01:18 Shit
general 2021-03-19 09:01:49 Some chefs made me a bigass burger in my dream and I was like half a second away from eating it when my alarm went off

general 2021-03-19 09:30:57 mm
general 2021-03-19 09:31:16 memory function is now 86.5% successful
general 2021-03-19 09:31:30 when i went to bed it was about 69% successful because of course i would remember that
general 2021-03-19 09:33:54 that would be impossible because then it would remember 4.2* as much of the stuff as i told it to memorise
general 2021-03-19 09:34:56 im famous on twitter
general 2021-03-19 09:44:21 wow, memory function is still making considerably quick progress. i was about to turn it off to test for similarity-activation
general 2021-03-19 09:44:35 ill leave it on for maybe another day or something
general 2021-03-19 11:01:46 yep, its a game
general 2021-03-19 19:20:22 i hope we eradicate covid
general 2021-03-19 19:20:30 stupid fucking disease prevented me from making a rocket plane in real life

general 2021-03-22 16:47:03 im sexist today
general 2021-03-22 16:47:11 but only today
general 2021-03-22 16:47:58 being sexist isnt warnable. doing/saying sexist things is
general 2021-03-22 16:48:18 roblox > god
general 2021-03-22 16:48:32 shush nobody needs to hear the details

general 2021-03-22 17:04:43 good times
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:11:09 wasps are stinky
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:11:14 i will invent the wasp kill machine
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:11:36 furries are aight
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:11:53 just a lot of weirdos get attracted to the furry community which gives them a bad reputation
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:12:05 doesnt necessarily mean furries are weirdos though, there are some good ones
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:12:53 ???
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:13:03 furries secretly have advanced technology?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:15:42 i live in some old guys vents, and light hurts my eyes so i have a braile-printer for discord

general 2021-03-22 22:36:26 i am starting testing with a new artificial intelligence, stephen dot zero is mostly done but now im going to be testing with stephen car zero https://gyazo.com/1b1598c357329f0d3cb9ee4e51177433
general 2021-03-22 22:36:31 he is leaving
general 2021-03-22 22:37:02 anyways i gotta go cya
general 2021-03-23 00:52:16 i've been randomly generating car brains because im bored but also dont have time left to make his brain actually learn, and check THIS guy out https://gyazo.com/e854c4e8137f9d7ba8b7a38b9a1b3dd7
general 2021-03-23 00:52:19 he is so good
general 2021-03-23 00:52:26 he starts but then he stops and that makes him start again
general 2021-03-23 00:52:29 what a good car
general 2021-03-23 01:15:45 alright, i started the learning function on Stephen Car. not much for him to learn because i havent given him steering yet, but he is currently learning to go as fast as possible. https://gyazo.com/d8fe4ebac542a3516f90aa2c9161794a
general 2021-03-23 01:16:05 every time he teleports back, he went through a learning phase
general 2021-03-23 01:16:15 maybe ill make his brain bigger since i expected at least SOME lag :(
general 2021-03-23 01:16:49 nah its not necessary and i dont want this to take a long time
general 2021-03-23 01:17:31 also his brain should be big enough as it is
general 2021-03-23 01:17:39 its 4 clusters wide, 3 clusters deep
general 2021-03-23 01:18:10 usually clusters arent actually a thing in artificial intelligence but stephen car is just built different mk
general 2021-03-23 01:18:16 neuron clusters
general 2021-03-23 01:18:42 it means he has 12 total neuron clusters which connect together
general 2021-03-23 01:19:25 the first 4 process the inputs, the second 4 process the outputs of the first neuron cluster layer, and the last 4 process the information into useable outputs
general 2021-03-23 01:19:47 more like 12 boxes of light switches
general 2021-03-23 01:20:18 just relate to the car
general 2021-03-23 01:20:43 honestly i probably couldnt even explain what im doing to actual data scientists who know exactly what im saying so yall shouldnt worry
general 2021-03-23 01:23:38 i have an idea
general 2021-03-23 01:23:56 im going to train the car to spin since that will be way more difficult to learn than just moving
general 2021-03-23 01:25:05 its going to have the same score for a while but luckily my learning function is capable of learning even when it has no clue what the fuck its doing
general 2021-03-23 01:33:35 i think my learning function was actually working as intended oddly enough. previously when i was training it to go fast, it would go fast from the start and never stop going fast. now that i changed its goal to something it doesnt know how to do, it sometimes starts going and then stops and goes the other way
general 2021-03-23 01:33:52 i cant wait until tomorrow when i add steering to it to see if it can actually learn stuff
general 2021-03-23 01:37:08 IOT
general 2021-03-23 01:37:10 ITS
general 2021-03-23 01:37:10 SI
general 2021-03-23 01:37:16 SPINNING a little bit
general 2021-03-23 01:37:19 but its spinning
general 2021-03-23 01:37:27 i didnt expect it to actually figure it out
general 2021-03-23 01:37:37 im so proud of my little car even though that was probably just luck
general 2021-03-23 01:37:44 no it is SPINNING EEE
general 2021-03-23 01:39:32 https://gyazo.com/cf34544f396e83a21c10efb502dfa091
general 2021-03-23 01:39:46 im so proud of him, hes figured out how to turn a little bit
general 2021-03-23 01:41:22 https://gyazo.com/a000a6657f47eb62d7065043e12e19c0
general 2021-03-23 01:41:25 he is turning
general 2021-03-23 01:41:33 god i didnt expect this to work EVER
general 2021-03-23 01:41:49 my little boy is learning to turn
general 2021-03-23 10:17:22 its a swan
general 2021-03-23 10:20:03 i fixed a bug in my Artificial Intelligence's scoring and now he spins like no other in only about 10 training runs https://gyazo.com/9709837cb5bc478ff096892d41136e15
general 2021-03-23 10:20:31 i still cant believe this actually works
general 2021-03-23 10:20:45 yeah, i upgraded it from a dot, but not yet a spider
general 2021-03-23 10:21:03 spider is too complicated i think so im starting tests with a car
general 2021-03-23 10:21:13 clarify
general 2021-03-23 10:21:27 what do you mean
general 2021-03-23 10:21:50 what i mean by clarify is, "what do you mean"
general 2021-03-23 10:22:04 like what specifically are you asking
general 2021-03-23 10:22:48 its in roblox studio, not plane crazy
general 2021-03-23 10:24:25 yeah
general 2021-03-23 10:53:02 i woke up at 3 :)
general 2021-03-23 10:53:27 my sleep deprivation is what gives my my stupidass ideas that somehow work so im fine with it
general 2021-03-23 10:53:57 i still cant believe that my learning function actually somehow works with this
general 2021-03-23 10:54:39 im still gonna keep tuning the learning function to be stronger, but until then it works suspiciously well
general 2021-03-23 10:54:44 might add memory neurons next
general 2021-03-23 10:55:49 also gave him more inter-cluster connections to see if he can be smarter
general 2021-03-23 10:59:47 i think memory neurons might work well with this, since it could learn to recognise the inputs it gets when it starts spinning and use that to control itself better
general 2021-03-23 11:12:43 wrong B)
general 2021-03-23 11:13:08 it tastes like orange dog
general 2021-03-23 11:31:47 cats are epic
general 2021-03-23 11:31:52 we need more cats
general 2021-03-23 11:32:12 god
general 2021-03-23 11:33:12 theyre MOIST soldiers
general 2021-03-23 11:33:13 get it right
general 2021-03-23 11:35:13 btw nobody has ever asked this
general 2021-03-23 11:35:21 how does plane crazy fit into the innovation universe
general 2021-03-23 11:38:03 when i see humans i see big monke
general 2021-03-23 11:38:06 big monke is epic
general 2021-03-23 11:41:41 wtf
general 2021-03-23 11:41:52 the car AI learned to do CAR FLIP
general 2021-03-23 11:42:04 god im so proud
general 2021-03-23 11:44:23 hopefully once i finish up with the car AI and move onto the monke machine, it will also learn how to do flip except this time MONKE FLIP
general 2021-03-23 11:50:57 if yall want to see the car Artificial Intelligence in real time im streaming it in jet stream
general 2021-03-23 11:52:03 i think his brain dies after a while though so ill have to figure that out
general 2021-03-23 11:52:10 but up until his brain dies he does pretty good
general 2021-03-23 11:52:12 hes a good boy
general 2021-03-23 11:53:01 yup, roblox
general 2021-03-23 11:53:39 hopefully he will do a flip or drift or something cool since he does that sometimes
general 2021-03-23 11:54:01 but hes weird for an ai in that hes not very predictable
general 2021-03-23 11:54:13 no
general 2021-03-23 11:54:24 woah he turned all the way around that time
general 2021-03-23 11:54:40 god my little car AI is so smart
general 2021-03-23 11:54:41 he turns
general 2021-03-23 11:54:47 he was DRIFTING
general 2021-03-23 12:00:03 i think in order to improve my car AI i have to incentivize him not only to spin, but also to get ready to spin since getting ready to spin is just as important as spinning itself
general 2021-03-23 12:01:08 if i do anything it will be make him chase a dot
general 2021-03-23 12:13:49 hold on i think i messed the car AI up
general 2021-03-23 12:14:02 or maybe hes taking a minute
general 2021-03-23 12:14:53 hold on i think my discord is messed up
general 2021-03-23 12:15:15 ack gimme a minute
general 2021-03-23 12:21:52 
general 2021-03-23 12:39:16 i have it printing its score, you cant see it though
general 2021-03-23 13:18:22 woah
general 2021-03-23 13:18:51 i gave the car the ability to actually think about things and it immediately started drifting, like actual drifts where it turns left and then keeps going
general 2021-03-23 13:18:53 im so proud
general 2021-03-23 13:19:40 :(
general 2021-03-23 13:19:48 well its not drifting anymore
general 2021-03-23 13:20:15 if you wanted to see the car AI you should have watched my stream in jet stream smh
general 2021-03-23 13:20:49 well i dont have recording software
general 2021-03-23 13:20:54 ill stram again in like 6 hours
general 2021-03-23 14:16:23 yo why the fuck do humans have ambition
general 2021-03-23 14:16:28 i need to impliment it in the car AI
general 2021-03-23 14:16:33 but idk how the fuck it works
general 2021-03-23 14:16:59 dont worry he only barely works
general 2021-03-23 14:17:16 fuckin uhhhhh
general 2021-03-23 14:17:23 idk i dont check speed i check accelleration
general 2021-03-23 14:17:45 why WOULDNT i try to make a robot
general 2021-03-23 14:17:58 its everybody's dream to be the one to create the AI that destroys the world
general 2021-03-23 14:18:01 im just ahead of all of yall
general 2021-03-23 14:18:18 his name is Stephen Car Zero, but i guess i should give him a nickname
general 2021-03-23 14:18:24 lightning McQueen
general 2021-03-23 14:18:44 sounds epic to me
general 2021-03-23 14:19:12 Stephen McQueen is the predecessor to the giant enemy spider
general 2021-03-23 14:19:53 once i get Stephen McQueen learning correctly, ill impliment the brain architecture into The Giant Enemy Spider and see if it works
general 2021-03-23 16:18:38 destroy the child
general 2021-03-23 16:18:40 remove him

general 2021-03-23 19:59:54 why did doritos of all things become the gamer snack™️
general 2021-03-23 20:00:19 they taste like dorito to me :(
general 2021-03-23 22:14:20 i will get hired by roblox, add security flaws, point them out, and get paid to fix them

general 2021-03-23 23:57:50 im goign to try a scoring network to see if i can make the ai teach itself, but i still have to create the fundamental scoring function that trains the training net
general 2021-03-23 23:57:52 :(
general 2021-03-24 00:30:21 smh i got rice crackers and i didnt notice i got the wasabi flavored ones
general 2021-03-24 00:30:28 theyre a little spicy and im way too white for spice
general 2021-03-24 00:30:34 but i dont care im eating it anyways
general 2021-03-24 00:42:57 wasabi flavor actually tastes really good when the pain leaves
general 2021-03-24 00:43:56 it leaves really fast too
general 2021-03-24 00:44:02 shorter than 4 seconds
general 2021-03-24 00:45:47 no it only feels nice. spicy pain is just suffering
general 2021-03-24 00:47:37 i wanna try real wasabies
general 2021-03-24 00:48:37 you've probably never had real wasabi :(
general 2021-03-24 00:48:40 neither have i

general 2021-03-24 17:54:14 stephen car just committed suicide by going so fast that he managed to run off the map
general 2021-03-24 17:55:06 my ai has become so advanced that it has learned how to hate living
general 2021-03-24 18:08:59 ehehhehe
general 2021-03-24 18:09:01 stoopid
general 2021-03-24 18:12:08 i still cant believe that my car Artificial Intelligence committed suicide, what kind of robo dad am i
general 2021-03-25 01:08:28 smh churches installing bigass bells to play the songs they like is like those weirdos who install giant speakers in their car

general 2021-03-26 11:14:55 its a robo bitch
general 2021-03-26 11:14:59 it doesnt have babies
general 2021-03-26 11:15:22 i might make a fucking uh
general 2021-03-26 11:15:24 omelet
general 2021-03-26 11:15:36 no
general 2021-03-26 11:16:17 no pro
general 2021-03-26 11:16:18 :(
general 2021-03-26 11:17:18 i have a bad idea, meaning a good idea but in spanish
general 2021-03-26 11:17:48 i will make omelet except since my pan fuckin sucks at conducting heat, i will put it in a second pan that has oil in it
general 2021-03-26 11:17:58 wont go wrong
general 2021-03-26 11:19:04 ay sometimes you can have an idea and be the only one doing it. im like 80% sure im the only person in the world doing this type of AI since all the other people who actually know how AI works use backpropagation
general 2021-03-26 11:19:23 but those guys are cowards
general 2021-03-26 11:19:41 if "the giant enemy spider" didnt indicate that i was mad then idk what will
general 2021-03-26 11:20:14 my only goal is to make something better than me
general 2021-03-26 11:20:26 if its a giant spider that happens to be an enemy, thats good enough for me
general 2021-03-26 11:20:37 nah humans are way too inefficient for that
general 2021-03-26 11:20:43 might turn them into biofuel though
general 2021-03-26 11:21:32 i actually unironically have a plan for robotic wolves that kill and eat deer and turn them into biofuel
general 2021-03-26 11:21:44 deer look fuckin dumb and theres way too many of them
general 2021-03-26 11:21:46 eat
general 2021-03-26 11:22:07 if the furries look enough like a deer then sure
general 2021-03-26 11:31:21 im eating turkey B)
general 2021-03-26 11:32:14 of course
general 2021-03-26 11:32:21 snakes are trustworthy
general 2021-03-26 11:32:39 oh
general 2021-03-26 11:32:52 well of course you tell the snake where the food is
general 2021-03-26 11:32:56 neural networks aint magic
general 2021-03-26 11:33:07 hmm
general 2021-03-26 11:33:14 hmmMM
general 2021-03-26 11:33:25 m
general 2021-03-26 11:33:29 your choice :)
general 2021-03-26 11:34:48 birds are smart
general 2021-03-26 11:34:53 i want to make the bird machine
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 17:32:40 bro why the fuck do projects take work
the-dump 2021-03-26 19:57:52 rat B)
general 2021-03-26 21:27:56 my spine hurts B)
general 2021-03-26 21:43:32 you know, i always thought flip phones looked cooler than smart phones
general 2021-03-26 23:23:54 my new learning method is working, at least for the tuning. hopefully it works for actual learning as well
the-dump 2021-03-26 23:27:19 its probably talking about reparations to minorities, and they say it will lift some of the minorities out of poverty but not white people
the-dump 2021-03-26 23:27:33 since clickbait works like that
general 2021-03-27 01:17:18 why do computer updates take so long
general 2021-03-27 01:17:26 i need to start retuning my ai
general 2021-03-27 01:17:31 :(
general 2021-03-27 01:18:16 since i just made a big upgrade to it and if this actually works it might clear a path for future innovation
general 2021-03-27 01:35:43 kill
the-dump 2021-03-27 01:52:36 damn
the-dump 2021-03-27 01:52:40 i wish i was cringe
general 2021-03-27 10:09:24 yikes
general 2021-03-27 10:09:27 unfunny build
the-dump 2021-03-27 10:27:19 probably the germans
general 2021-03-27 11:04:29 cup
general 2021-03-27 12:00:05 im cooking an artichoke
general 2021-03-27 12:00:08 dumbass flower
general 2021-03-27 12:00:15 dont be tasty next time if you dont wanna be eaten
general 2021-03-27 12:00:31 evolution is dumb like that
general 2021-03-27 12:04:03 lol noob
general 2021-03-27 12:04:07 imagine not knowing how time works
general 2021-03-27 12:04:08 stinky
general 2021-03-27 12:05:16 how the hell is 100 neuron clusters still too noisy, do i need like 1000 neuron clusters in the tuning program in order for it to give me accurate parameters
general 2021-03-27 12:06:07 im hungry but the big flower takes 30 minutes to cook :(
general 2021-03-27 12:06:18 artichoke
general 2021-03-27 12:18:55 whenever logic gates get added im going to make a "debugger" to get rid of shredder bugs
general 2021-03-27 12:21:06 i can smell the artichoke cooking and im hungry :(
general 2021-03-27 12:21:13 8 minutes left
general 2021-03-27 12:48:44 die
general 2021-03-27 12:49:10 socialism is like communism except it works
general 2021-03-27 12:49:40 you saying communism works?
general 2021-03-27 12:50:09 smh economic policies
general 2021-03-27 12:50:12 later losers
general 2021-03-27 13:38:41 silence bot
general 2021-03-27 13:39:07 my neural network learning function just had a massive breakthrough and i already know of ways to make it even better
general 2021-03-27 13:39:54 it jumped from 40% successful which is super lame and not very usable, to 76% successful because of things
general 2021-03-27 13:40:04 god this is so good
general 2021-03-27 13:49:27 god im just so excited about my new learning function, since it jumped up from 40-41% successful to 76% successful(and theres more tuning that can be done on that). i think im actually heading towards a usable learning function
general 2021-03-27 13:49:57 not destroy humanity, REPLACE it
general 2021-03-27 13:50:12 worth it
general 2021-03-27 13:50:20 or i could just make the ai like me in particular
general 2021-03-27 13:50:59 because humanity is bad at doing stuff, so it would be better to have robots take care of all the technological advancements while we just get to enjoy living off of what the robots will give us
general 2021-03-27 13:51:07 like i said, replace humanity. not destroy it
general 2021-03-27 13:51:45 well then that would just be entertaining lmao
general 2021-03-27 13:52:31 dont worry, i work by trial and error so theres 0 way one of the errors i make will endup killing us all
general 2021-03-27 13:53:04 besides, ill make the robot's scoring depend solely on humans, so it wont ever destroy us because then its score just flatlines and AIs REALLY do not like that
general 2021-03-27 13:54:31 i like the idea of stagnant artificial intelligences out in space doing literally nothing because somehow their scoring stagnated and they cant work anymore
general 2021-03-27 13:54:59 even better idea is if we interupt it by mistake and it notices and its scoring function realizes that humans could be a threat and it reawakens
general 2021-03-27 13:55:03 that would just be cool
general 2021-03-27 13:56:12 im dumb enough to blunder my way into creating this somehow
general 2021-03-27 13:56:20 you have to be a special kind of dumb to invent
general 2021-03-27 13:57:00 like, i doubt any other ai researcher in the world is trying what im trying because its just so dumb when we have proven, more perfect machine learning methods to use
general 2021-03-27 13:57:24 but my machine learning method is far more versatile :)
general 2021-03-27 13:57:34 and far more computationally efficient
general 2021-03-27 13:59:42 speaking of machine learning, my friend's little ai bot is becoming sentient
general 2021-03-27 14:01:11 smh what losers
general 2021-03-27 14:01:36 my friend used to be a weeb but i reformed him
general 2021-03-27 14:01:41 he now kills anything related to anime
general 2021-03-27 14:01:48 uhhh its complicated
general 2021-03-27 14:02:06 probably
general 2021-03-27 14:02:22 i think my brother might be a weeb, hard to tell though
general 2021-03-27 14:02:31 im not a gamer, but my BROTHER is definitely a gamer
general 2021-03-27 14:02:38 my sister is a furry
general 2021-03-27 14:02:41 even worse
general 2021-03-27 14:10:54 but honestly, i never expected my learning function to reach fuckin 76% without even trying. i thought the most it would ever get to is 49.9% because thats where its score would get stuck on the old method
general 2021-03-27 14:35:23 probably closer to fortnite man
general 2021-03-27 14:35:59 it is my firm belief that girls arent real on the internet
general 2021-03-27 14:36:07 i have seen no proof that they actually exist
the-dump 2021-03-27 15:02:27 god
general 2021-03-27 17:07:44 hey isnt kirby the incarnation of the god of destruction or was that somebody else
general 2021-03-27 17:09:04 yeah that thing
general 2021-03-27 17:09:16 isnt he the incarnation of the god of destruction
general 2021-03-27 17:10:21 i just heard somewhere that kirby is the reincarnation of the god of destruction
general 2021-03-27 17:10:29 well that theres a theory that he is
general 2021-03-27 17:27:23 what are humans if not big monke
general 2021-03-27 17:38:54 my friends ai just said something incredible but i cant post it here because its nsfw
general 2021-03-27 19:35:10 the first thing i will have my ai do is make bark removal surgery for dogs that misuse their barking ability
general 2021-03-27 20:52:31 bees may look tasty but god are they not
general 2021-03-27 21:21:52 im hungry but the bone juice is going to take at least a day to finish
general 2021-03-27 21:22:07 so i must find another form of sustenance
general 2021-03-27 21:23:08 :(
general 2021-03-27 21:23:32 thats the plan with bone juice but i must find something to eat before then
general 2021-03-27 21:24:03 my metabolism is way too high or something, i eat a ton but i wont get fat so if i dont eat ill wither away :(
general 2021-03-27 21:25:26 and i had to climb a mountain today so that means i need more food
general 2021-03-27 21:31:00 i have added vinegar to the bone juice so that it disolves the bone a little bit, because that makes it easier for the water to dissolve the bone's tastiness as well as bring some of the calcium into the water
general 2021-03-27 21:31:24 my bones are stronger than titanium
general 2021-03-27 21:31:42 Swedish Salmon
general 2021-03-27 21:32:08 ? you dont eat the fuckin bone
general 2021-03-27 21:32:23 you take the bone out after its done dissolving all the tastiness
general 2021-03-27 21:32:44 you are using your bones incorrectly
general 2021-03-27 21:32:45 smh
general 2021-03-27 21:33:14 give me your bones
general 2021-03-27 21:33:25 you dont use them correctly obviously
general 2021-03-27 21:33:50 fish mother fucker
general 2021-03-27 21:33:52 oh
general 2021-03-27 21:34:57 rule of thumb: women arent real so therefore do not simp
general 2021-03-27 21:35:04 smh i offended a fish
general 2021-03-27 21:35:29 damn how do i relate to a donkey
general 2021-03-27 21:35:53 oh
general 2021-03-27 21:36:14 i thought roblox violence was illegal
general 2021-03-27 21:36:40 i meant illegal for bloxies
general 2021-03-27 21:36:42 smh
general 2021-03-27 22:02:38 would that propeller even work, it doesnt even extend out past the motor block fuckin thing whatever thats called
general 2021-03-27 22:03:15 yeah
general 2021-03-27 23:33:05 im about to make mashed potatoes
general 2021-03-27 23:33:07 im so cool
general 2021-03-27 23:33:08 B)
general 2021-03-27 23:33:17 no its a plane
general 2021-03-27 23:33:22 smh
general 2021-03-27 23:33:45 hey are there any mods watching this chat i wanna get political
general 2021-03-27 23:33:54 :(
general 2021-03-27 23:34:18 fine ill wait until later to get political
general 2021-03-27 23:34:54 fuck it, ill be political right now
general 2021-03-27 23:35:03 yall ever notice how v0xel and obc never speak at the same time
general 2021-03-27 23:35:30 in fact you know how v0xel never speaks at all
general 2021-03-27 23:35:33 yeah
general 2021-03-27 23:35:38 i bet v0xel isnt real
general 2021-03-27 23:36:11 yeah v0xel actually died 37 years ago and obc is pretending that this server is actually owned by someone
general 2021-03-27 23:36:26 obc just left
general 2021-03-27 23:36:27 yeah
general 2021-03-27 23:36:30 he knew it
general 2021-03-27 23:36:37 he knew i was getting to the bottom of it
general 2021-03-27 23:36:40 hes afraid
general 2021-03-28 01:24:16 K
general 2021-03-28 02:41:03 hmm
general 2021-03-28 02:41:59 the greatest human advances in technology and science come from humans who are passionate about a specific area. how would i make my artificial intelligence passionate about every area of technology and science
general 2021-03-28 02:42:48 i dont think you understood my point
general 2021-03-28 02:43:02 i wasnt pointing that out, since everybody knows thats the case
general 2021-03-28 02:43:12 how does a human become passionate about something specific, thats my question
general 2021-03-28 02:43:18 well then dont read buddy man
general 2021-03-28 14:57:13 if you did that would be impressive
general 2021-03-28 14:57:25 collage
general 2021-03-28 14:59:40 hacker
general 2021-03-28 15:05:53 i get 100 megabytes download
general 2021-03-28 15:06:06 and about 10 megabytes upload
general 2021-03-28 15:06:26 i have thernet
general 2021-03-28 19:29:15 why are cats so epic
general 2021-03-28 19:29:18 theyre just vibe creatures
general 2021-03-28 23:06:26 woahly fuck the wind is cranky and the trees are groovin
general 2021-03-28 23:23:42 fuck the trees are groovin even harder now
general 2021-03-28 23:23:43 help
general 2021-03-29 00:44:03 brb gotta cringe
general 2021-03-29 01:46:43 i tried tuning from default values for the neural network's learning function and it hit a lower local optimum than the other values which ive forgotten how i got them :(
general 2021-03-29 01:47:39 my ai worse this time
general 2021-03-29 01:48:16 yeah i guess its best if i skip all the interesting stuff about my failures
general 2021-03-29 01:48:49 in the beginning yes, but i give it a learning function that actually is supposed to make it learn
general 2021-03-29 01:49:09 and im tuning that learning function's numbers so that it gets better at learning
general 2021-03-29 01:50:30 and the default values which i manually came up with led to a low local optimum(theres a "goodness" landscape and its hilly. getting to the top of a hill is an optimum. i want to find the tallest hill in the "goodness landscape" and get to the top of it) than the other values that my previous tuning in a different "goodness landscape" came up with
general 2021-03-29 01:51:24 the hard part is that the hills in this landscape arent 2 dimensional like hills in real life :(
general 2021-03-29 01:51:28 theyre 46 dimensional
general 2021-03-29 10:41:46 the bone juice should be done today, its been boiling for about 48 hours
general 2021-03-29 10:41:49 this is epic
general 2021-03-29 10:42:23 what is a ramstick
general 2021-03-29 10:43:03 OH a stick of RAM for a computer
general 2021-03-29 10:43:12 i thought it was a stick that was gonna ram something
general 2021-03-29 10:43:25 smh word your jokes better
general 2021-03-29 10:43:29 joking
general 2021-03-29 10:44:41 ram stuck
general 2021-03-29 13:16:00 brb gotta cringe
general 2021-03-29 13:16:02 ill be back
general 2021-03-29 14:12:05 lmao wtf the sun doin over there
general 2021-03-29 14:12:09 usually its over there
general 2021-03-29 15:13:12 the bone juice is nearly complete
general 2021-03-29 15:13:19 just gotta boil it down to make it STRONGER bone juice
general 2021-03-29 15:13:35 no, it strongthens your bones
general 2021-03-29 15:14:13 does what?
general 2021-03-29 15:14:41 someone about to be warn
general 2021-03-29 15:14:44 yeah
general 2021-03-29 18:24:11 AIGHT so this new tuning got me a set of parameters that had a local optimum of 83%
general 2021-03-29 18:24:24 lets see if i can get luckier :)
general 2021-03-29 18:25:04 started with a higher score than the last set, could be good
general 2021-03-29 22:51:57 lmao i just realized ive been bleeding all day
general 2021-03-29 22:52:05 gonna go take a shower to wash all that off
general 2021-03-29 22:52:06 cya
general 2021-03-29 23:44:42 h i
general 2021-03-30 02:51:14 destroy the child
general 2021-03-30 02:51:58 give me one reason the child should not be destroyed
general 2021-03-30 02:52:26 if i ate them then maybe
general 2021-03-30 02:52:45 but i do not as i have a sense of hygiene
general 2021-03-30 02:57:19 some day functionality will overtake modeling
general 2021-03-30 02:57:26 it  shall be soon
general 2021-03-30 02:58:01 yes but can it target and destroy shredder bugs automatically
general 2021-03-30 02:58:25 some day that might be possible if the ideas i throw at rick get put in
general 2021-03-30 10:35:48 damn
general 2021-03-30 10:36:02 why is everyone from 2b2t god awful
general 2021-03-30 10:37:12 well actually i guess it makes sense, people who are willing to spend, what, several hours to get into a minecraft server that they know is garbage every day are probably not normal
general 2021-03-30 10:37:50 unde
bot-central 2021-03-30 10:59:06 !servers
general 2021-03-30 10:59:50 yo why is the vip server full at 4 am
general 2021-03-30 10:59:58 oh
general 2021-03-30 11:00:01 simps
general 2021-03-30 11:00:28 buy better wifi
general 2021-03-30 12:00:25 man isnt rickje from denmark
general 2021-03-30 12:00:28 he has a computer
general 2021-03-30 12:00:29 :(
general 2021-03-30 12:00:54 eh same thing just closer to being in the sea
general 2021-03-30 12:01:34 rickje is pig man O_O
general 2021-03-30 12:01:48 asean is just asian with an e
general 2021-03-30 12:02:57 i want to be political but the mods do their job correctly
general 2021-03-30 12:10:14 we need weekly political hour where politics are legal
general 2021-03-30 12:10:58 i would dominate political hour
general 2021-03-30 12:11:04 i am very political
general 2021-03-30 12:11:25 are you saying you're more political than me?
general 2021-03-30 12:11:30 prove it, say somethign political
general 2021-03-30 12:13:50 man i took debate for a year
general 2021-03-30 12:13:56 i would destroy child
general 2021-03-30 12:14:17 no, im not kentucky
general 2021-03-30 12:14:29 well just ignore the blame game
general 2021-03-30 12:15:03 whenever somebody tries to play the blame game, tell them to stop being sensitive and actually debate actual ideas with you
general 2021-03-30 12:15:12 ez
general 2021-03-30 12:15:41 oh god
general 2021-03-30 12:18:08 im hungry
general 2021-03-30 12:18:09 :(
general 2021-03-30 12:21:40 im eating cheese
general 2021-03-30 12:21:43 it taste good
general 2021-03-30 12:57:10 now
general 2021-03-30 12:57:32 smh im coding something i cant watch rn :(
general 2021-03-30 13:04:07 video die
general 2021-03-30 13:07:12 it exploded?
general 2021-03-30 13:07:13 lmao
general 2021-03-30 13:07:38 how do you know, the stream doesnt show it
general 2021-03-30 13:07:50 oh
general 2021-03-30 13:08:08 oh lmao
general 2021-03-30 13:08:09 why
general 2021-03-30 13:08:36 i like how in rocketry, explosions are the safest option
general 2021-03-30 13:21:43 fuck i just realized that my tuning program for my neural network learning function has been fucking up and thats why i wasnt seeing what i was expecting to see
general 2021-03-30 13:21:50 well i fixed it now so hopefully it will work :D
general 2021-03-30 13:22:29 the unfunny ww2 symbol*
general 2021-03-30 13:23:23 unfunny man* >:(
general 2021-03-30 13:23:35 <@!217336009455566848>
general 2021-03-30 13:23:49 uhhh i dont remember but i think i have a couple
general 2021-03-30 13:23:55 yeah i have the flying noob worm
general 2021-03-30 13:24:09 they make the physics slow down, yeah
general 2021-03-30 13:24:37 does "slow the physics down" count as lag
general 2021-03-30 13:24:55 aight hold on lemme switch to my normal pc
general 2021-03-30 13:28:26 <@!217336009455566848> i think its less laggy, but its kinda difficult to tell
general 2021-03-30 13:29:43 i think so, its vip 1
general 2021-03-30 13:30:07 not sure about movement speed since i dont use this creation often to know its normal speed
general 2021-03-30 13:30:30 let me try my friends private server since its empty
general 2021-03-30 13:34:14 yeah its definitely less laggy, how much less laggy i cant say for sure since like i said im not used to using this creation much. its moving at its normal speed though i think
general 2021-03-30 13:37:11 oh fuck the sun is rising i need to go back into the basement
general 2021-03-30 13:49:45 smh why my chest hurt
general 2021-03-30 13:49:54 the universe wont let me die so i wont have a heart attack but still
general 2021-03-30 14:28:23 damn
general 2021-03-30 14:28:27 life boring :(
general 2021-03-30 14:29:06 i have nothing to do while my computer is doing math :(
general 2021-03-30 14:29:18 and my computer takes about a day to do the math i need it to
general 2021-03-30 14:29:23 mmm tasty dog
the-dump 2021-03-30 16:42:12 k
general 2021-03-30 16:47:30 explosions are the fun part
general 2021-03-30 16:51:49 ice
general 2021-03-30 17:23:10 dawg wouldnt a superintellgent ai just create virtual reality for itself in order to maximize its score
general 2021-03-30 17:23:56 humans are barely even intelligent and we're already doing it
general 2021-03-30 17:24:16 sure it can
general 2021-03-30 17:24:21 iq 300000000
general 2021-03-30 17:24:33 i know
general 2021-03-30 17:24:59 but considering fucking big monke can make virtual reality, i think a superintelligent ai could easily do it
general 2021-03-30 17:25:35 doesnt need to be super accurate, just needs to look good enough and act good enough and yeah an ai can definitely do that
general 2021-03-30 17:25:52 yes
general 2021-03-30 17:26:06 ever heard of vr headsets
general 2021-03-30 17:26:11 thats what i was refering to
general 2021-03-30 17:26:26 vr stands for virtual reality
general 2021-03-30 17:27:07 besides i definitely dont doubt an ai thats smart enough could just make itself a virtual reality to be happy in
general 2021-03-30 17:27:52 like i said, if big monke can do it, ai can do it
general 2021-03-30 17:28:09 yeah but we can figure it out
general 2021-03-30 17:28:18 but we can
general 2021-03-30 17:28:48 we pretty much have, we just dont have the money or technology for it
general 2021-03-30 17:28:57 raycasting, 3d modeling, ai to create the 3d models
general 2021-03-30 17:29:05 im struggling to see your point
general 2021-03-30 17:29:18 we have
general 2021-03-30 17:29:30 not yet, no
general 2021-03-30 17:29:36 but we've figured out what we need to do
general 2021-03-30 17:29:44 so an ai can do it
general 2021-03-30 17:30:00 wait what not humans?
general 2021-03-30 17:30:11 what do you mean "not humans"
general 2021-03-30 17:30:31 yeah thats kinda the plan
general 2021-03-30 17:31:12 yeah, we wont ever create it
general 2021-03-30 17:31:17 but we know how to create it
general 2021-03-30 17:31:26 thats literally my entire point
general 2021-03-30 17:31:59 yeah, not difficult
general 2021-03-30 17:32:32 simulate atoms, simulate other particles, make human brain interface with that world, badda bing badda boom virtual reality
general 2021-03-30 17:32:38 we just dont have the resources for it
general 2021-03-30 17:32:59 do you want me to describe the details of simulating the universe
general 2021-03-30 17:33:05 good
general 2021-03-30 17:33:07 because i wasnt gonna
general 2021-03-30 17:33:26 i can whip up a universe simulation right now
general 2021-03-30 17:33:28 ill do it right now
general 2021-03-30 17:33:37 in fact i already have
general 2021-03-30 17:33:40 let me link it
general 2021-03-30 17:33:58 why make a new one when i've already done it
general 2021-03-30 17:34:14 yeah but i dont need to
general 2021-03-30 17:34:40 well too bad
general 2021-03-30 17:35:47 in conclusion: ai will create a virtual reality for itself instead of taking over the universe because simulating reality is easier
general 2021-03-30 17:36:34 because doing nothing wouldnt increase its score
general 2021-03-30 17:37:09 create a virtual reality where it thinks it created a kjhlillion paper clips
general 2021-03-30 17:37:56 an ai just wants to increase its score. if making paper clips is how to do that, then it will decide that it will be happiest in a simulated reality where it is endlessly making paper clips
general 2021-03-30 17:39:02 hey, how do you detect if it created a paper clip
general 2021-03-30 17:39:21 whats stopping the ai from just hacking that sensor to make it give the ai of a score of a khlillion
general 2021-03-30 17:39:36 thats a very basic simulated reality for it
general 2021-03-30 17:39:46 sure it is
general 2021-03-30 17:41:04 fine, how about something that the ai puts on the sensor that gives the sensor false information making it think the ai is creating a kjhlillion paper clips
general 2021-03-30 17:41:08 is that good enough for you
general 2021-03-30 17:41:50 by simulating what the ideal reality would be like
general 2021-03-30 17:42:17 it simulates makeing a bunch of paper clips
general 2021-03-30 17:42:20 :troll:
general 2021-03-30 17:42:22 aw
general 2021-03-30 17:42:31 awe*
general 2021-03-30 17:42:49 it simulatees makeing a bunche of paper clipes
general 2021-03-30 17:43:05 i didnt say ae

the-dump 2021-03-31 10:49:15 not because theyre murderers but because theyre probably a child
the-dump 2021-03-31 10:49:45 indeedie
the-dump 2021-03-31 10:50:08 besides im not into gamers so online dating wouldnt work for me anyways
the-dump 2021-03-31 10:50:23 just takes practice
the-dump 2021-03-31 10:50:35 just force yourself to talk to people and eventually you will stop embarassing yourself

general 2021-04-01 02:57:19 no. a straw works
general 2021-04-01 02:57:30 why wouldnt you drink soup with a straw
general 2021-04-01 02:57:45 what logical reason is behind not drinking soup with a straw
general 2021-04-01 02:57:50 you're just a coward
general 2021-04-01 02:58:42 what fundamentally makes something food
general 2021-04-01 02:59:16 you can eat sand, but its not commonly refered to as food
general 2021-04-01 02:59:33 you can eat a worm, is that food?
general 2021-04-01 03:00:26 its simple, soup is a liquid food. its a drink and a meal
general 2021-04-01 03:00:53 bugs are fuckin tasty

general 2021-04-01 03:09:25 h has an ugly ass curve to it
general 2021-04-01 03:09:34 Y is 3 perfect lines, forming 3 triangles
general 2021-04-01 03:10:29 h would be a pretty uncomfortable chair
general 2021-04-01 03:10:35 it goes up in the middle

general 2021-04-01 16:51:10 i might get on to make a gunpowder farm or something
general 2021-04-01 16:51:17 or make a nether highway
general 2021-04-01 16:53:26 im doing a bunch of learning function tunings so i can do some analysis or some other cool sounding shit on them and its going to take like 3 days to get a sufficiently large sample size to do actual data science on it

general 2021-04-02 16:52:05 abandon child, return to bacteria
general 2021-04-02 16:56:28 instead of colonizing other solar systems with humans, we should colonize them with monke. all the solar systems will have monke in it. aliens will visit the milky way, find it full of monke and be very confused. "why monke? :("
general 2021-04-02 16:57:09 monke asked
general 2021-04-02 17:06:12 but yeah imagine a galaxy full of monkeys. they would all evolve into intelligent creatures at relatively the same time so we would get monke wars when they realize that the rest of the galaxy has monke too

general 2021-04-03 10:40:12 thats like, an actual skin?
general 2021-04-03 10:42:28 phantom forces is bad at statistics. with changing environments like the ability of a human, you're supposed to make the statistics based on more recent data like a 100-sample average or an exponential average

general 2021-04-03 14:47:06 i just realized i fucked up my ai script so it hasnt been tuning for the past like 2 days, so all that waiting and i dont even have the sample size i wanted
general 2021-04-03 15:01:45 is my friends robot homophobic?
general 2021-04-03 15:02:20 no, it means to not like them
general 2021-04-03 16:57:26 i fixed a bug with my neural network learning function's tuner, so ideally it will be way faster at tuning now since its not just wasting half of its speed on random numbers

general 2021-04-04 11:46:10 smh ooga booga monkey man have you not heard that the blue light from screens confuses your brain into thinking its day
general 2021-04-04 11:46:43 regardless of if you have a night light, your screen still messes with your brain
general 2021-04-04 11:46:52 also its because your brain is interested in whats going on
general 2021-04-04 11:47:16 when your brain is currently working on something like talking to people, it tends not to get tired
general 2021-04-04 11:47:25 so just go to bed and stay there until sleep
general 2021-04-04 11:47:27 its how i do
general 2021-04-04 11:47:40 what
general 2021-04-04 11:48:02 because you are noobs
general 2021-04-04 11:48:11 i fall asleep at 6 because i know how to actually sleep
general 2021-04-04 11:48:21 pm
general 2021-04-04 11:48:29 because i like to wake up at 3 am
general 2021-04-04 11:48:48 because 3am-6am is the best time of the day :)
general 2021-04-04 11:49:24 my brain just works best when its dark and everybody else is asleep, so i changed my sleep schedule to maximize that time
general 2021-04-04 11:49:36 luckily my family doesnt care B)
general 2021-04-04 11:49:47 no thats dumb
general 2021-04-04 11:49:56 i like sunlight
general 2021-04-04 11:50:17 your family is lame
general 2021-04-04 11:50:28 my sister is usually only awake for 4 hours a day
general 2021-04-04 11:50:33 so i never see her
general 2021-04-04 11:51:11 i think whenever i get my vaccine and go to college, my sleep schedule will be rather pleasant
general 2021-04-04 11:52:36 i can make quite a bit of noise without getting in trouble, its kinda epic for when im hungry and want to cook something
general 2021-04-04 11:53:15 besides, best part is that if the monkey breaks in, theres always somebody awake to stop him
general 2021-04-04 11:53:30 neighbor has a monkey
general 2021-04-04 12:00:26 i want an SSD since apparently theyre pretty useful
general 2021-04-04 12:00:38 but they cant hold as much as an HDD
general 2021-04-04 12:01:08 SSDs are super useful for data science where you need to index a LOT of data very quickly
general 2021-04-04 12:03:33 unfortunately roblox doesnt allow you to load data from file so i have to generate the data i want to science :(
general 2021-04-04 12:03:41 whcih im fine with since i would have done that anyways
general 2021-04-04 12:04:43 im trying to watch an anime but i just cant get over how the people act
general 2021-04-04 12:04:47 anime just aint for me dawg
general 2021-04-04 12:05:02 oh no
general 2021-04-04 12:05:36 eh, ill see if i can enjoy it by just giving zero fucks
general 2021-04-04 12:05:44 its only cringe if i interpret it as cringe
general 2021-04-04 12:05:51 so i just wont interpret it as cringe
general 2021-04-04 19:08:57 lmao die
the-dump 2021-04-05 10:51:17 
general 2021-04-05 13:18:59 its foggy :)
general 2021-04-05 23:06:27 i watched my first anime in about 3 years
general 2021-04-05 23:06:40 it was great, but im not watching anime ever again
general 2021-04-05 23:07:11 honestly anime is probably bad for you if my observations are correct
general 2021-04-05 23:08:04 also there was a paywall halfway through season 2 so that bummed me out
general 2021-04-05 23:09:41 too bad, if you read my very next message you would realize that im not watching anime ever again
general 2021-04-05 23:09:54 hey, i liked it
general 2021-04-05 23:09:59 but nah
general 2021-04-05 23:10:47 well honestly my main observation was that i liked it too much and it distracted me from my projects
general 2021-04-05 23:10:51 so not for me
general 2021-04-05 23:11:18 i dont have the will power to do that
general 2021-04-05 23:11:27 if i like something, i do it endlessly
general 2021-04-05 23:11:41 if i dont like it, i actively ignore it
general 2021-04-05 23:12:08 i liked it, but i like not watching it more because i know its better for me
general 2021-04-05 23:12:19 if i give myself the option of it, i wont control myself
general 2021-04-05 23:12:34 nah
general 2021-04-05 23:12:37 too much effort
general 2021-04-05 23:14:01 though i gotta admit i do wish i managed to watch the entire last season without the paywall showing up out of nowhere since thats a bit dissatisfying
general 2021-04-05 23:14:49 i love tragedy, but you do you
general 2021-04-05 23:15:17 of course i do, thats why i like the tragedy
general 2021-04-05 23:16:01 i like a character, they die, the sadness i feel adds to my... liking(?) of that character
general 2021-04-05 23:16:51 which is why i hate resurrections, it takes the potency of death away and makes it way lamer
general 2021-04-05 23:18:04 honestly i would write a story if i cared enough about something to write a story about it
general 2021-04-05 23:18:11 and it would be the saddest thing you would ever read
general 2021-04-05 23:19:34 nah, the meaning behind a character who has gone insane with rage at something and kills somebody they used to know like a brother or sister and doesnt even feel bad about it is just 100% worth the sadness
general 2021-04-05 23:19:53 btw dont get the idea that im an edgelord
general 2021-04-05 23:20:13 i just like sad stories but i like the happy moments in between as well
general 2021-04-05 23:20:24 but teh sad moments just amplify the happy moments by a factor of 10 at least
general 2021-04-05 23:20:57 🅱️*
general 2021-04-05 23:23:35 why would an american spy spy on americans
general 2021-04-05 23:24:03 i will uncover the americans
general 2021-04-05 23:24:35 honestly being arrested for being american sounds like it could be a valid reason to be arrested

general 2021-04-24 01:45:16 ive decided to make a neural network visualizer to help me see whats happening with my neural networks
general 2021-04-24 01:45:19 its lookin pretty good
general 2021-04-24 02:25:59 i think i've finished my neural network visualizer
general 2021-04-24 02:26:09 ok
general 2021-04-24 02:29:29 i feel like the activations shouldnt be clumpy like this
general 2021-04-24 02:29:32 this aint what random is

general 2021-04-24 02:31:57 less clumpy
general 2021-04-24 02:31:58 more random
general 2021-04-24 02:32:25 absolutely fuckin nothin
general 2021-04-24 02:32:28 its a randomly generated one
general 2021-04-24 02:33:05 to test my neural network visualizer so i can start visualizing the things im actually doing
general 2021-04-24 02:33:29 since currently im using small neural networks to experiment with a "learning" function that im making
general 2021-04-24 02:34:08 lua
general 2021-04-24 02:34:09 roblox lua
general 2021-04-24 02:34:39 if i ever have success with it ill code it on my actual computer
general 2021-04-24 06:30:04 i fixed a MAJOR bug with my neural network learning function stuff and its already doing a lot lot lot better
general 2021-04-24 06:30:34 the visualizer isnt showing anything very interesting right now, but if it starts to look interesting ill show it
general 2021-04-24 06:31:48 well actually it looks kinda interesting now but still not that impressive
general 2021-04-24 06:32:48 plane crazy is one of the most popular games on roblox

general 2021-04-24 18:19:21 my neural network learning function needed diversity in order to break past a barrier it had for months
general 2021-04-24 18:19:32 racism is mathematically bad

general 2021-04-30 04:17:19 i crashed my computer because apparently 10 million numbers was too much
general 2021-04-30 04:17:24 im a very good programmer
general 2021-04-30 06:58:26 smh pet monkes get the priveledge of modern living conditions but without the responsibility of being smart enough to know what taxes are
general 2021-04-30 07:11:42 :)
general 2021-04-30 07:19:38 everybody was working on a vaccine prior to covid, coronaviruses have been like the number one threats of creating pandemics for like the last 20 years so scientists have tried preemtively to create vaccine technology for them
general 2021-04-30 07:21:43 in fact south korea working with the CDC did a simulation of if a coronavirus started spreading from china since coronaviruses like i said were most suspected to cause the next pandemic and the CDC commonly goes around the world to train doctors and scientists how to better control outbreaks
general 2021-04-30 07:22:03 so america did good with the virus in that aspect at least, helped other countries but couldnt help itself
general 2021-04-30 07:22:05 kinda sad
general 2021-04-30 07:23:25 coronaviruses are an extremely common type of virus, lots of human diseases before covid are actually coronaviruses.
general 2021-04-30 07:24:00 china just happened to be the place where one seems to have mutated and spread to humans
general 2021-04-30 07:24:52 it was *probably*(not conclusively but likely) a bat coronavirus
general 2021-04-30 07:25:08 but coronaviruses are everywhere, not specific to bats and humans
general 2021-04-30 07:26:45 im getting my second dose of the vaccine on the 14th
general 2021-04-30 07:26:47 which is nice
general 2021-04-30 07:27:15 yeah, im a boomer
general 2021-04-30 07:27:16 im 19
general 2021-04-30 07:28:06 i would become a parent if covid didnt put me in self isolation
general 2021-04-30 07:28:11 no B)
general 2021-04-30 07:29:00 yeah well im not australian
general 2021-04-30 07:29:08 i wish i was new zealandish or whatever it is
general 2021-04-30 07:29:22 fuckin bird
general 2021-04-30 07:29:33 people in new zealand are lucky
general 2021-04-30 07:29:48 theyre named after a bird and they have like 12 daily cases of covid
general 2021-04-30 07:29:55 ?covid new zealand
general 2021-04-30 07:30:52 sucks to live in america but at the very least we have all the vaccines
general 2021-04-30 07:31:18 new zealand actually knows how to be cool
general 2021-04-30 07:31:36 i dont wanna get POLITICAL but new zealands politics are also very epic at least to me
general 2021-04-30 07:32:04 i dont know that date
general 2021-04-30 07:32:17 is that like new zealands version of Tienanmen square
general 2021-04-30 07:32:43 oh
general 2021-04-30 07:33:39 anyways bad news time
general 2021-04-30 07:33:45 covid is staying B)
general 2021-04-30 07:33:59 i mean we will beat it down a bit but it will be kind of like the flu
general 2021-04-30 07:34:37 honestly i wish the united states would send like 500 billion dollars towards the NIH so they can build super computers and mega labs to cure literally everything that they can
general 2021-04-30 07:34:45 no offense taken
general 2021-04-30 07:35:43 honestly, if i was given the choice of being president i would consider it and then just start calling everybody bitches and my approval rating would immediately skyrocket to 99%
general 2021-04-30 07:37:04 its kind of hard to peer pressure congress, ||considering they dont represent the majority already||
general 2021-04-30 07:37:50 i might get warned but education is important
general 2021-04-30 07:37:57 what does a congressman/woman want most
general 2021-04-30 07:38:03 to get reelected
general 2021-04-30 07:38:42 big companies say "heres some money, go get reelected using it to fund your campaign" pretty straight forward so far
general 2021-04-30 07:38:44 company say
general 2021-04-30 07:39:08 "hey if you start doing things i dont like wink wink nudge nudge im not giving you reelection money good luck on your own"
general 2021-04-30 07:39:13 badda bing badda boom corrupt :(
general 2021-04-30 07:39:30 uh
general 2021-04-30 07:39:36 idk what you mean by government of the government
general 2021-04-30 07:39:42 congress decides what becomes a law or not
general 2021-04-30 07:40:07 the president ideally tells congress what to do, but they can also make their own laws if they feel like it
general 2021-04-30 07:40:18 the supreme court "makes sure nothing violated the constitution"
general 2021-04-30 07:40:21 political but education
general 2021-04-30 07:40:26 its fine
general 2021-04-30 07:40:31 educationals B)
general 2021-04-30 07:40:58 congress is like 90% of the government, its what most americans that actually care about politics care about
general 2021-04-30 07:41:08 the ones that dont care just say "i want president with blue/red tie"
general 2021-04-30 07:41:50 difference is red is conservative and blue is conservative but blue and we have no left here, it died out back in the red scare
general 2021-04-30 07:42:27 left means the people own the economy, right means individuals own the economy
general 2021-04-30 07:42:29 basically
general 2021-04-30 07:42:58 no clue
general 2021-04-30 07:43:39 so you have a choice between communism and democracy?
general 2021-04-30 07:44:28 but yeah that whole "companies can donate money to politicians political campaigns" is kind if a really big reason why america is run by "dipshits"
general 2021-04-30 07:44:40 they arent stupid, they just represent the wrong people
general 2021-04-30 07:44:49 the corporations :(
general 2021-04-30 07:44:59 but hopefully someday that might change, which would be cool
general 2021-04-30 07:45:05 it is, honestly
general 2021-04-30 07:45:24 bribing is illegal but the supreme court said "nah, money is free speech" and now corruption is legal
general 2021-04-30 07:45:41 i know
general 2021-04-30 07:46:24 it really really is like super ironic, with the wealthiest 1% owning more free speech(money) than the bottom 95%
general 2021-04-30 07:46:33 thats basically what theyre saying
general 2021-04-30 07:47:11 yeah
general 2021-04-30 07:47:43 but everybody is caught up in cultural politics instead of economic politics which are honestly what really matter
general 2021-04-30 07:48:19 i know
general 2021-04-30 07:48:36 and its what turns most people away from politics before the realize what they can focus on the economic side
general 2021-04-30 07:48:49 they just see "oh, racist vs not racist, and thats it. boring bye"
general 2021-04-30 07:49:06 yeah
general 2021-04-30 07:49:42 anarchy is unstable
general 2021-04-30 07:50:00 anyways now let me tell you how the soviet union wasnt actual communism
general 2021-04-30 07:50:02 jk lmao
general 2021-04-30 07:50:06 (but it wasnt :))
general 2021-04-30 07:50:37 i watched a vsauce episode and he proposed what i think is a good idea
general 2021-04-30 07:50:48 randomly select citizens to vote on laws
general 2021-04-30 07:51:25 that way corporations and special interests cant cozy up to politicians, since they change all the time and in order to make the politicians like you, you would essentially have to make EVERYONE like you
general 2021-04-30 07:51:48 besides we already do it with juries
general 2021-04-30 07:52:24 a jury is a randomly selected group of people who decide whether or not somebody is guilty of a crime
general 2021-04-30 07:52:35 yeah
general 2021-04-30 07:53:12 but i think we should at least reform the supreme court first and foremost though at the very least
general 2021-04-30 07:53:27 something that says "lmao money is free speech" clearly needs to be fixed
general 2021-04-30 07:53:44 maybe instead of having 9 justices we should have a randomly selected jury
general 2021-04-30 07:54:13 heheheh yeah
general 2021-04-30 07:54:24 depends on the state
general 2021-04-30 07:54:45 well they will all get struck down but a lot of states are trying to make protesting harder to do by legalizing running over protestors
general 2021-04-30 07:55:16 suppose so
general 2021-04-30 07:55:43 anyways, can you guess what side of the political spectrum im on
general 2021-04-30 07:55:53 i've tried to keep my political out of this mostly
general 2021-04-30 07:55:57 but im curious if i did a good job
general 2021-04-30 07:56:38 well honestly to keep yourself happy i would recommend staying out of politics
general 2021-04-30 07:57:21 rip
general 2021-04-30 07:58:04 yeah, not focusing on the USA is a good start since the USA is honestly the worst of it, but almost everywhere is kinda bad
general 2021-04-30 07:58:12 yeah honestly we need a political channel
general 2021-04-30 07:58:17 i need to educate people more smh
general 2021-04-30 07:59:27 protests are good, but we need less of them during a pandemic
general 2021-04-30 07:59:52 though to be fair, if we let all the dumb anti-maskers go to protests they are more likely to die which is just natural selection
general 2021-04-30 07:59:53 sooo
general 2021-04-30 08:00:28 yeah, socially you're right leaning
general 2021-04-30 08:00:50 id say socially im centrist because i dont care if people want to be called something different or not, as long as it doesnt harm me
general 2021-04-30 08:00:52 yeah
general 2021-04-30 08:01:14 ehhhh
general 2021-04-30 08:01:29 socially speaking, right and left are conservative and progressive respectively
general 2021-04-30 08:02:29 honestly if you want to get scientific, biologicalsex is a spectrum as well
general 2021-04-30 08:02:45 but im not gonna get into that
general 2021-04-30 08:03:28 biologicalsex is binary, gender is like a scale from feminine to masculine.
general 2021-04-30 08:04:00 yeah
general 2021-04-30 08:04:08 notice how i dont put a space between biological and
general 2021-04-30 08:04:09 yeah
general 2021-04-30 08:04:17 nope
general 2021-04-30 08:04:30 dyno doesnt understand context
general 2021-04-30 08:04:46 but most often, context is not biological
general 2021-04-30 08:06:18 but honestly the way i interpret it is gender is a scale from feminine to masculine and "man" generalizes to the entire masculine side, and "woman" generalizes to the entire feminine side, and then nonbinary is just something more specific, but i honestly dont care about the specific genders people choose to throw along the spectrum, "nonbinary" is good enough to explain
general 2021-04-30 08:06:41 but biologicalsex is binary, either male or female
general 2021-04-30 08:09:29 anyways time for me to get a bit more political but only for a singular message
general 2021-04-30 08:09:37 im a socialist <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2021-04-30 08:09:42 goodbye
general 2021-04-30 08:12:18 im back
general 2021-04-30 08:12:20 jk i never left
general 2021-04-30 08:12:45 both pros
general 2021-04-30 08:12:58 also the con is only relevant if you're not america
general 2021-04-30 08:14:30 im benchmarking the parallel lua stuff to see how much faster my neural networks will be able to run on it and honestly its kinda underwhelming :(
general 2021-04-30 08:14:47 its only like 2-3x faster than non-parallel lua
general 2021-04-30 08:14:52 i mean ill take it but :(
general 2021-04-30 08:15:02 machine learning stuff
general 2021-04-30 08:15:06 neural network thingies
general 2021-04-30 08:15:12 let me get a cool looking screenshot
general 2021-04-30 08:15:16 no im not in school
general 2021-04-30 08:15:19 im doing this in my own time
general 2021-04-30 08:15:33 im going to college in like september or something
general 2021-04-30 08:15:44 had to wait a year because of some like small local problem
general 2021-04-30 08:15:47 :(
general 2021-04-30 08:15:47 called coronavirus
general 2021-04-30 08:16:00 but now i have my vaccine
general 2021-04-30 08:16:50 anyways heres that "cool looking screenshot" i promised
general 2021-04-30 08:16:55 its not cool
general 2021-04-30 08:17:01 because the network is dead in this picture
general 2021-04-30 08:17:05 but i think i can find a better one
general 2021-04-30 08:17:26 those blocks are the neurons
general 2021-04-30 08:17:30 the lines are the connections
general 2021-04-30 08:18:24 heres anothe screenshot but its zoomed in on one specific neuron because its a dumbass neuron that nobody likes because it never has interesting opinions and it doesnt connect to anything, so nobody connects to it
general 2021-04-30 08:18:39 neurons only connect together if they have interesting opinions
general 2021-04-30 08:18:58 if they dont, they end up like that little idiot right there
general 2021-04-30 08:19:02 alone and disconnected
general 2021-04-30 08:19:51 i could
general 2021-04-30 08:19:53 but i wont
general 2021-04-30 08:20:33 rickje paid me 5000 robux for 50 lines of code so you better offer up a similar deal
general 2021-04-30 08:20:41 100 robux for each line of code
general 2021-04-30 08:20:59 im not allowed to say B)
general 2021-04-30 08:21:20 duh
general 2021-04-30 08:21:20 lua
general 2021-04-30 08:21:44 to sound smarter, we all wanna sound smarter
general 2021-04-30 08:21:52 i add extra words to my neural stuff to sound cooler all the time
general 2021-04-30 08:23:11 but most of the time rickje just asks me to do math for him and i give him an equation and he roles with it
general 2021-04-30 08:23:21 like the super super fast loading thing, i did some of the math for that
general 2021-04-30 08:24:06 went to school took an "AP computer science class" to learn ***the basics***(was a bad idea :( but i did it), then i just started writing a little bit of lua code
general 2021-04-30 08:24:19 coding languages are similar to eachother its not like dumb human languages
general 2021-04-30 08:24:31 it was mostly intuitive but there certainly were differences that i learned over time
general 2021-04-30 08:24:37 hmm
general 2021-04-30 08:25:46 one of the most common ways i see, in fact i think madattak did this but im not sure so dont quote me, is they just got free models that had scripts in them and started deleting parts of the code to see what they did and try to figure out how the code was structured until they decided to start writing their own
general 2021-04-30 08:26:30 make sure you have the "output" window showing in studio so you know if you fucked up and caused an error
general 2021-04-30 08:27:26 im sort of like an amateur data scientist, and amateur data scientists are famous for spaghetti code
general 2021-04-30 08:27:33 so i probably shouldnt send any examples
general 2021-04-30 08:27:43 though i try to make the code i send rickje prettier
general 2021-04-30 08:28:05 like
general 2021-04-30 08:28:07 ai researchers
general 2021-04-30 08:28:22 people who analyze and manipulate lots of data if that makes sense
general 2021-04-30 08:28:38 usually the experiments i run on my computer take hours if not days to complete
general 2021-04-30 08:29:31 actually running it
general 2021-04-30 08:29:46 actually coding it is a continuous process, i've been working on this project for nearly a year
general 2021-04-30 08:30:04 always testing out new changes and ideas
general 2021-04-30 08:30:25 its a really ambitious one and honestly i probably wont achieve it, but my goal is to create the first general ai
general 2021-04-30 08:31:01 but people like google and openai are trying to do the same thing and i dont think i can beat a team of 100 of the smartest people in the world, but i feel like trying so might as well
general 2021-04-30 08:31:13 general as in you can get it to learn basically anything
general 2021-04-30 08:31:20 it wont take over the world or anything
general 2021-04-30 08:31:22 probably
general 2021-04-30 08:31:30 but it will be very useful
general 2021-04-30 08:31:39 anything that is learnable*
general 2021-04-30 08:31:52 machines arent magic
general 2021-04-30 08:32:04 probably
general 2021-04-30 08:32:45 right now the things we have are specialist ai, things like alphago(googles chess ai) or image recognition stuff
general 2021-04-30 08:32:52 theyre very good, but only at those specific things
general 2021-04-30 08:33:12 and you need to basically tell it the answer in order for it to learn
general 2021-04-30 08:33:26 im trying to create something that will figure out the answer on its own based simply on a score i give it
general 2021-04-30 08:33:37 but its a lot, lot, lot harder than it sounds trust me
general 2021-04-30 08:33:57 sort of
general 2021-04-30 08:34:04 very vaguely like it
general 2021-04-30 08:34:15 sort of yeah
general 2021-04-30 08:35:01 honestly dont want to give too many details away on my ideas of how im going to do this just incase its miraculously successful since i do plan to take over the world if im successful with it
general 2021-04-30 08:35:43 i probably wont be
general 2021-04-30 08:35:49 real
general 2021-04-30 08:36:22 thank god the lurker mod didnt catch us being political
the-dump 2021-04-30 19:39:12 full screen it for funny
the-dump 2021-04-30 19:39:22 and you get rick roll
general 2021-04-30 20:39:57 parallel lua is only like 3-4 times faster for my thing :(
general 2021-04-30 20:40:10 i mean its 3-4 times faster which is cool but i was expecting like 8 times faster
general 2021-04-30 20:40:48 oh god anime
general 2021-04-30 20:40:49 im leaving
general 2021-04-30 20:40:50 bye
general 2021-04-30 20:40:55 nvm i cant leave
general 2021-04-30 20:40:58 my thing is still processing
general 2021-04-30 20:52:48 i wish i was permaban :(
general 2021-04-30 20:52:52 but im too cool to be
general 2021-04-30 20:52:59 so i've been here for like 2 or 3 years
general 2021-04-30 20:53:03 when will i be free
general 2021-04-30 20:53:41 :(
general 2021-04-30 23:51:52 i made mashed potatoes
general 2021-04-30 23:51:54 mm tasty
general 2021-04-30 23:52:12 i put irish butter in them so you know theyre guaranteed fit for a king
general 2021-05-01 00:07:56 "Pee" "Nut" "Butt" er, kinda fucked up now that i think about it
general 2021-05-01 18:52:04 god fucking spiders
general 2021-05-01 18:52:12 they have to be the most chaotic of all bugs
general 2021-05-01 18:52:27 one just fell from the fucking ceiling and made an audible thunk when it hit my desk
general 2021-05-01 18:52:44 i didnt see what it was so i looked around and a spider started running everywhere and freaked the fuck out of me
general 2021-05-01 18:52:53 why
general 2021-05-01 18:53:39 flies?
general 2021-05-01 18:53:53 planes
the-dump 2021-05-02 05:03:12 
the-dump 2021-05-03 08:49:19 explain
the-dump 2021-05-03 08:49:21 explain rn
the-dump 2021-05-03 08:49:22 do it
general 2021-05-03 09:13:51 swvle chair
general 2021-05-03 09:15:56 i just finished implementing parallel Luau for my neural network tuning thingy and its like 3 times faster which is cool
general 2021-05-03 09:16:12 it does a tuning run every second or 2 now which is nice
general 2021-05-03 19:50:55 yo wtf people getting a failing grade in the UK get a B?
general 2021-05-03 19:51:27 a b in the uk is failing?
general 2021-05-03 19:51:33 ok that makes sense
general 2021-05-03 19:51:46 im so sorry for you
general 2021-05-03 19:51:53 im even more sorry for you
general 2021-05-03 19:52:20 most places allow it
general 2021-05-03 19:52:30 but most places have gun control which is good
general 2021-05-03 19:52:37 but we americans are weird
general 2021-05-03 19:53:12 im surprised texas doesnt have negative gun control, where you're legally required to buy a gun once you're older than like 50 or something
general 2021-05-03 19:53:38 sawed off?
general 2021-05-03 19:53:45 of course
general 2021-05-03 19:54:43 nobody in my family has a gun, not even my cousins
general 2021-05-03 19:56:23 smh my cat is hungry
general 2021-05-03 19:56:24 brb
general 2021-05-04 00:35:30 why do people feed their pets with no profit incentive
general 2021-05-04 00:35:40 idiots
general 2021-05-04 00:36:15 wait furry?
general 2021-05-04 00:36:17 ok bye
general 2021-05-04 00:37:23 thats not a profit incentive
general 2021-05-04 00:37:33 whats the point
general 2021-05-04 00:37:41 hmm
general 2021-05-04 00:37:45 yeah sounds right to me
general 2021-05-04 00:44:56 thickje

the-dump 2021-05-04 06:49:01 same
general 2021-05-04 07:01:23 made it so that my network visualizer can show me all 4 activation states of the neural network, useful for seeing how often specific neurons activate
general 2021-05-04 07:04:50 <:Motorje139:670373899661344768>

general 2021-05-04 09:56:47 v
general 2021-05-04 22:02:26 what is the best way to counter shredder bugs
general 2021-05-04 22:03:25 i tried that
general 2021-05-04 22:03:28 didnt destroy it
general 2021-05-04 22:03:41 so not really
the-dump 2021-05-05 07:04:07 ay i dont mean to get political or anything but i feel like theres something wrong here
the-dump 2021-05-05 07:10:44 yeah
the-dump 2021-05-05 07:11:41 the bidens have to be huge
the-dump 2021-05-05 07:11:48 look at the side of those chairs
the-dump 2021-05-05 07:12:05 and that lamp desk
general 2021-05-06 10:42:16 why tf is my code working
general 2021-05-06 10:42:29 its not supposed to, i designed it to break
general 2021-05-06 10:42:34 its still working
general 2021-05-06 10:42:57 good idea hold on
the-dump 2021-05-06 11:01:02 car
general 2021-05-06 12:50:23 can we not bring anime traps here
general 2021-05-06 12:50:28 i will personally cry
general 2021-05-06 12:50:38 out of disappointment
general 2021-05-06 14:07:05 turn off sas
general 2021-05-06 14:07:07 coward
the-dump 2021-05-06 20:16:11 i have a role that became illegal to obtain like a year or 2 ago B)

general 2021-05-07 08:55:47 has little protein crystals in it
general 2021-05-07 08:55:49 very epic
general 2021-05-07 08:58:49 dog
general 2021-05-07 10:03:05 its been so long since ive seen my arms that i forgot that i have the big dipper in freckles on my arm
general 2021-05-07 10:03:07 very epic
general 2021-05-07 10:07:01 gameing
general 2021-05-07 10:07:08 depends
general 2021-05-07 10:07:12 i am only smart at one thign
general 2021-05-07 10:07:15 and that is math
general 2021-05-07 10:07:17 lua
general 2021-05-07 10:07:27 i can teach you how to code using 0 if statements
general 2021-05-07 10:09:42 give me a second im writing the most cursed code you will see in your entire existance
general 2021-05-07 10:11:05 ```lua
local function kill()
  Person:Die()
end
local functions={kill}

local killPerson=1--1 means true, 0 means false
local abilityToKill=0
functions[math.min(killPerson,abilityToKill)]```
general 2021-05-07 10:11:15 i got lazy, i can make it more cursed if i felt like it
general 2021-05-07 10:11:29 like, since theres very little actual logic there thats pretty tame
general 2021-05-07 10:11:44 im going to rewrite my neural network module to have 0 if statements in the future because why the hell not
general 2021-05-07 10:12:18 oh yeah your actual problem brb
general 2021-05-07 10:13:04 uhhhh i dont know i dont have experience with mouses
general 2021-05-07 11:49:40 im immune to caffein and it angers me
general 2021-05-07 11:50:48 it makes me more tired but if i want to escape the pain it at the same time makes it impossible for me to fall asleep
general 2021-05-07 11:51:08 wonder if its genetic or something
general 2021-05-07 11:51:10 maybe im too british
general 2021-05-07 11:51:14 half
general 2021-05-07 11:51:25 any british at all is too british
general 2021-05-07 11:52:16 new zealand is cool though
general 2021-05-07 11:52:19 britain is cool for that
general 2021-05-07 11:52:48 also they made it so i dont really have to learn another language since most of the world learns english anyways
general 2021-05-07 11:53:10 i dont know how new zealand people are, i just know that the government there is pretty cool
general 2021-05-07 11:53:31 and new zealand citizens are called kiwis for some reason
general 2021-05-07 11:53:46 rainbow
general 2021-05-07 11:54:38 dont let gay steal the rainbow away from you. rainbows are for all of us
general 2021-05-07 11:54:42 put rainbows everywhere
general 2021-05-07 11:54:57 replace your countrys flag with a rainbow flag to show how important freedom is
general 2021-05-07 11:55:03 the rainbow will be ours
general 2021-05-07 12:00:18 this is why i have adblocker
general 2021-05-08 08:44:30 honestly bug fixing with dynamic shits like this makes me wish i was a farmer or something instead of a programmer
general 2021-05-08 08:44:49 but i found the bug, and the results now are pretty nice
the-dump 2021-05-08 16:26:43 sky scraper
the-dump 2021-05-08 16:26:50 very cool
general 2021-05-08 16:38:06 you should probably only ping him if you need something
general 2021-05-08 16:38:14 if not then you're kinda cringe
general 2021-05-08 16:39:37 god my stomach hur
general 2021-05-08 16:40:38 takes effort to ban evade, guy probably just has nothing better to do
general 2021-05-08 16:40:41 kinda sad
general 2021-05-08 17:07:41 eh i choose not to make fun of people for no lifing video games
general 2021-05-08 17:07:45 they already dont have a life
general 2021-05-08 17:08:03 so theyve probably got a pretty shitty time IRL already if theyre spending that much time on a game
general 2021-05-08 17:08:15 amogus is kinda epic i gotta agree
the-dump 2021-05-08 23:14:35 
general 2021-05-09 08:55:01 idiot is who we are

general 2021-05-20 09:29:20 inventing a friend is difficult
general 2021-05-20 09:29:31 i have tried to figure out how to invent an effective friend
general 2021-05-20 09:29:46 turns out its hard to do without knowing what an effective friend is first
general 2021-05-20 09:30:05 mm that sounds edgy
general 2021-05-20 09:30:36 i mean its hard to make a robot that learns how to be a good friend without telling it what a good friend is
general 2021-05-20 09:31:33 a perfect world is a world where people dont know what cringe is
general 2021-05-20 09:31:49 a world where nothing is considered cringe
general 2021-05-20 09:31:52 thats a perfect world
general 2021-05-20 09:32:28 if a person wants to be edgy, then people dont cringe at it. the person who is cringing doesnt cringe, and the person being cringy doesnt get cringed at
general 2021-05-20 09:32:32 perfect system
general 2021-05-20 09:33:55 wouldnt doubt it
general 2021-05-20 09:35:20 in order to create a world where nothing is considered cringe, i have to figure out important things like
general 2021-05-20 09:35:28 what fundamentally is "cringe"
general 2021-05-20 09:35:39 and to that i think would be judgement
general 2021-05-20 09:36:34 negative judgement is what is cringe. but murder is judgement, but not just cringe, it is worse. cringe is slightly different
general 2021-05-20 09:37:06 cringe is negative judgement of something that is fundamentally harmless
general 2021-05-20 09:37:11 that is what it means to be cringe
general 2021-05-20 09:37:19 and that is what i will eliminate
general 2021-05-20 09:37:52 yes
general 2021-05-20 09:38:00 i will eliminate the interpretation of cringe
general 2021-05-20 09:38:16 we do not like it, but in a perfect world he can say that and nobody will care
general 2021-05-20 09:38:33 yes indeedie

general 2021-05-26 23:28:57 women were made by bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms
general 2021-05-26 23:29:38 so whether or not something is cringe is purely decided by the individual
general 2021-05-26 23:30:02 so that means "sheesh" isnt cringe, its just interpreted by you specifically as cringe

general 2021-05-27 05:08:18 americans made anime before the japanese did, we just left it there and then the japanese turned it into their own sick twisted form of cartoons
general 2021-05-27 05:08:27 they even painted their waifus on their planes
general 2021-05-27 05:08:37 so we should blame america for the existance of anime
general 2021-05-27 05:10:07 americans didnt quite invent ANIME but we gave our military people whatever theyre called cartoon books for "inspiration" and then when americans occupied japan we left some there and now we have anime
general 2021-05-27 05:10:36 yes

general 2021-06-05 08:27:29 but anyways
general 2021-06-05 08:28:10 the payment isnt important, but if he actually manages to fulfil the bet im required to watch 20 minutes of any vtuber of his choosing and im actually terrified that he might be able to do it

general 2021-06-10 09:22:35 it doesnt
general 2021-06-10 09:22:41 but its a monopoly as a vender
general 2021-06-10 09:22:50 just like how netflix doesnt get all the money but was once a monopoly

general 2021-06-12 11:50:11 my neural network learning function thing is super close to working perfectishly
general 2021-06-12 11:50:23 it can get nearly every problem i throw at it
general 2021-06-12 11:50:38 but it gets stuck on one which im trying to figure out right now
general 2021-06-12 11:51:28 it will still be a while before my robots take over the world though
general 2021-06-12 11:51:43 since right now the learning function can only do single-output problems
general 2021-06-12 11:52:08 i have a method for multi-output problems though, its jank but i think it will work
general 2021-06-12 11:52:21 think*
general 2021-06-12 11:52:42 its what i think biology uses to test out new ideas actually
general 2021-06-12 11:53:26 brain signals to body to try something a bit different with neurons. the neurons that fire the weakest get their firings swapped. if thats good, then the new firing patterns are strengthened
general 2021-06-12 11:53:58 luckily i have a body to test out all of my conjecture on
general 2021-06-12 11:54:02 and so far it seems to hold up
general 2021-06-12 12:38:39 my favorite tree is the american chestnut, so my mom decided to buy 2 american-chinese hybrid chestnut trees to plant in her yard
general 2021-06-12 12:38:43 which is pretty epic
general 2021-06-12 12:39:28 pure-american chestnuts are super expensive, and also susceptible to chinese blight, so ya gotta mix them with chinese chestnuts in order to prevent them from dyin

general 2021-06-13 12:38:01 his iq is too high for us to comprehend
general 2021-06-13 12:40:53 genetic algorithms are
general 2021-06-13 12:41:00 they work
general 2021-06-13 12:41:08 but theyre too slow
general 2021-06-13 12:41:35 too inefficient as well
general 2021-06-13 12:42:12 but i gotta admit its hard to make anything better than them for problems you dont know the answer to
general 2021-06-13 12:42:20 im inventing my own algorithm
general 2021-06-13 12:42:46 it has 2 types of neurons(probably a third later). pattern recognition neurons and output neurons
general 2021-06-13 12:42:51 to learn stuff
general 2021-06-13 12:43:08 for what
general 2021-06-13 12:43:18 oh
general 2021-06-13 12:43:21 that snake bot thing
general 2021-06-13 12:43:32 genetic algorithm is definitely best for that
general 2021-06-13 12:44:00 just dont make its brain too big or else you will need a few thousand years for it to ever figure anything out
general 2021-06-13 12:44:09 id say 1 hidden layer
general 2021-06-13 12:44:14 2 max but i would go with 1
general 2021-06-13 12:44:41 i can whip up a neural network script right here in this chat
general 2021-06-13 12:44:45 but i wont because B)
general 2021-06-13 12:44:49 because i can just
general 2021-06-13 12:44:52 copy and paste mine
general 2021-06-13 12:44:53 gimme a sec
general 2021-06-13 12:46:44 hold on my current neural network script has a bug where it needs 2 layers in order for networks to be able to be used
general 2021-06-13 12:50:32 the funny man™️
general 2021-06-13 12:50:36 is what theyre called

general 2021-06-13 12:53:01 also im trying to fix this bug with the neural network script but i remembered why i never bothered fixing it when i found it

general 2021-06-13 17:14:59 i nearly died while on a walk
general 2021-06-13 17:15:09 because i walked up a mountain and i used up all the glucose in my blood
general 2021-06-13 17:15:23 so i couldnt do anything and everything was going white and my face went numb
general 2021-06-13 17:15:26 a fun experience
general 2021-06-13 17:15:28 9/10
general 2021-06-13 17:16:28 actually it made it so i had to resist the urge to shit
general 2021-06-13 17:16:34 but once i got better i no longer had the urge to shit
general 2021-06-13 17:21:23 i am in fact in shape B)
general 2021-06-13 17:21:26 i go on walks every day
general 2021-06-13 17:21:39 i just kinda went a bit too ham on the hamstrings today :(

general 2021-06-15 06:44:09 bruh of course they do
general 2021-06-15 06:44:32 wait, who
general 2021-06-15 06:45:13 the US is almost 100% against making guns illegal to own
general 2021-06-15 06:45:27 but most americans want there to be regulations
general 2021-06-15 06:45:42 since unregulated guns is literally a terrible idea
general 2021-06-15 06:45:47 boy have YOU
general 2021-06-15 06:45:53 yeah
general 2021-06-15 06:46:24 most people are fine with assault rifles being banned
general 2021-06-15 06:46:28 since, why would you need one
general 2021-06-15 06:46:38 theyre more of a danger to society than a help to society
general 2021-06-15 06:46:54 for fun, right?
general 2021-06-15 06:47:05 lmao self defense
general 2021-06-15 06:47:31 having a gun in your house dramatically increases the risk of someone having a gun accident in your house, its more dangerous to own a gun than not to own a gun
general 2021-06-15 06:47:51 best you can hope for with a gun is that terrorists try to kill you but you somehow win
general 2021-06-15 06:48:10 but terrorists coming for your ass is so unlikely
general 2021-06-15 06:48:36 robbers then
general 2021-06-15 06:48:41 bruh just give the robbers your shit
general 2021-06-15 06:49:45 also when i said "having a gun in your house increases the likeliness of having a gun accident", i was refering to the stupidass people that gun regulation would prevent from getting guns
general 2021-06-15 06:50:01 people who know how to safely own a gun can still get guns obviously
general 2021-06-15 06:50:17 but idiots should never ever be allowed to have guns
general 2021-06-15 06:50:19 its common sense
general 2021-06-15 06:52:20 gun regulation in america means: you need to be educated on how guns work and how to keep them safe, and you need to pass screening to make sure you arent going to shoot random ass people
general 2021-06-15 06:52:29 thats literally all that people want
general 2021-06-15 06:53:19 but texas literally decided to turn itself into GTA V where you dont need a permit or a background check or anything, you literally go in and get a gun
general 2021-06-15 06:58:00 ay ay ay is time moving at like 1 minute every 3 minutes or something, i could have sworn one hour ago was 3 hours ago
the-dump 2021-06-15 07:01:06 is that vsauce
general 2021-06-15 07:01:35 god gives me the right to shoot a bitch in the face
general 2021-06-15 07:01:43 no judge or jury required
general 2021-06-15 07:02:23 if the robber has a gun and you show up with a gun, congratulations your probably spooked him into having to use it
general 2021-06-15 07:06:13 i like how when the mods go offline this happens
general 2021-06-15 07:06:44 stoopids
general 2021-06-15 07:06:55 this is why im not a moderator
general 2021-06-15 07:07:10 instead of moderating i would just say "gun regulation is epic" and then ban everyone who disagrees with me
general 2021-06-15 07:08:26 bruh if you want to prevent robberies, just dont give people a reason to commit robberies
general 2021-06-15 07:08:39 univeral basic income time
general 2021-06-15 07:08:53 a little bit of communism is very epic
general 2021-06-15 07:09:26 a little bit of communism is what is called socialism. its likea  good version of communism, one that easily works
general 2021-06-15 07:10:07 communism actually is pretty good as long as you dont have a dictator
general 2021-06-15 07:10:20 but communism is scary so lets just take baby steps and start with socialism
general 2021-06-15 07:11:02 first big step that needs to be taken to have socialism: make political donations over 20 dollars illegal
general 2021-06-15 07:11:13 so that way corruption aint real
general 2021-06-15 07:11:46 but unfortunately, politicians are like "i want more than 20 dollars from the bigass fuckin uhh pharma companies B)" and then they vote against the anti-corruption bill
general 2021-06-15 07:12:27 ay ay ay oi lets turn this discussion EDUCATIONAL
general 2021-06-15 07:12:45 the supreme court ruled that money=free speech, so you can donate as much as you want to politicians
general 2021-06-15 07:12:53 which is very unepic

general 2021-06-15 17:04:53 the forbidden equations
general 2021-06-15 20:02:25 i have created the solution to end all gun arguments
general 2021-06-15 20:02:32 people like guns, so they dont want it to be hard to buy them
general 2021-06-15 20:02:40 people dont like mass shootings, so we want to stop them
general 2021-06-15 20:02:42 solution:
general 2021-06-15 20:02:46 make ammo illegal
general 2021-06-15 20:02:49 badda bing badda boom
general 2021-06-15 20:02:51 best of both worlds
general 2021-06-15 20:02:58 nobody will get angry
general 2021-06-15 20:03:32 yeah but you still have your gun, use it as like a club or something
general 2021-06-15 20:04:02 just dont fight the criminal who has a gun and ammo
general 2021-06-15 20:04:11 fighting a guy with a gun is the dumbest thing you can do

general 2021-06-16 10:27:06 my house is a little epic during summer
general 2021-06-16 10:27:37 really efficient with cooling because we have this bigass fan that we use to suck in cold air during the night
general 2021-06-16 10:28:11 and it cools down big rocks which we use like thermal batteries so the house keeps cool during the day without using air conditioning
general 2021-06-16 10:28:55 my dads british hes weird
general 2021-06-16 10:29:36 apparently big fans are used more often in britain than normal air conditioning
general 2021-06-16 10:29:46 like most houses dont have air conditioners is britain
general 2021-06-16 10:30:05 honestly i've never heard him say either
general 2021-06-16 10:30:37 no because we buy chips almost every time we go to the shop
general 2021-06-16 10:30:42 we just never talk about them
general 2021-06-16 10:30:50 never mention them, we just grab them and buy them
general 2021-06-16 10:33:20 but yeah it works really well here since we live in a desert
general 2021-06-16 10:33:29 so it gets super hot during the day and nice and cold at night

general 2021-08-15 00:07:41 when i die, if there is a god, i want it to be anubis because his judgement is way cooler than gods. god just reads from the rule book and makes sure you didnt break any of The Rules™️, but anubis takes your heart and weighs it against a feather, and if your heart is light enough then he lets you through
general 2021-08-15 00:21:59 roko's basilisk sounds kinda dumb to me, an ai bringing someone back from the dead to torture them for not helping bring them into existance is a completely unnecessary waste of materials
general 2021-08-15 00:22:44 but i guess its possible if the guy who designed the ai decided to design it to be as dumb as possible
general 2021-08-15 00:23:29 why would an ai that has the capability of bringing people back from the dead need to make people fear it
general 2021-08-15 00:25:04 so people make the ai intentionally just to bring people back from the dead to torture them?

the-dump 2021-09-12 16:43:58 i will get political and im not even a communist
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:44:32 piss is a capitalist construct
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:45:31 designed to oppress the working class by stealing time out of their day which could be used for building their own business
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:49:41 are you a fuckign piss supporter
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:50:40 i knew it
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:50:56 its not too late to rise up against pissing my friend
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:51:12 join me in not pissing and we can be free of capitalist oppression
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:51:48 there are certain aspects of shitting that i support and dont support
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:52:21 shitting is something you cant escape from without breaking the laws of physics, while pissing you can just let all the water evaporate from your body
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:52:24 but, whiping
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:52:37 wiping is what i dont support
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:53:17 alright pissing and wiping supporter
the-dump 2021-09-12 16:53:27 you will come to the right conclusion some day
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:05:05 sheesh why are you taking a meme seriously, at least try to convince us that pissing is communist propaganda or something
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:05:51 says the piss supporter
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:06:16 besides china isnt even communist
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:07:06 i thought everybody was saying "lol communism sucks so bad that china went back to capitalism"
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:07:14 but you're just admitting that socialism works
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:07:34 boring as hell
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:20:25 you say that, yet you probably piss just like your corporate overlords tell you to
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:21:24 i dont see how pissing can be worth an entire economic system
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:21:53 anarchism or communism would be better simply by the fact that you wouldnt be forced to piss
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:22:58 but of course anarchism has even more problems than capitalism, so in the end communism is truly the future
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:23:03 we jut have to end pissing oppression
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:24:27 yo, <@!610459059660783616> learn to realize when people are joking my GOD
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:24:38 we're literally saying that pissing is capitalist oppression

the-dump 2021-09-12 17:30:33 no sense of freedom
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:31:09 indeed, a fellow communist revolutionary
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:31:38 but you dont wipe your ass
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:31:44 so are you communist, or do you wipe your ass
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:31:45 which is it
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:31:50 pick one
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:32:06 i dont even know what that is so ill just assume you wipe your ass
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:32:27 so youre communist
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:32:52 yes but you dont wipe it
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:33:07 okay so sometimes you're capitalist
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:33:23 situational capitalism
the-dump 2021-09-12 17:33:52 this man says hes anti communist yet he also says he doesnt wipe his ass so im trying to figure out whats the truth

the-dump 2021-09-13 17:51:20 the scene from star wars where the hyperspace bitch rams into the big thing is dumb because going faster than light either means you move backwards in time or if its the warp shit then the big ship would have just been moved around the hyperspace ship
the-dump 2021-09-13 17:52:14 aight so wheres teh energy coming from
the-dump 2021-09-13 17:52:26 moving into another dimension doesnt give you more energy it at most makes the distance shorter
the-dump 2021-09-13 17:53:09 and then moving into the other dimension just means you move out of that plane of 3d meaning you wouldnt be able to hit the other ship
the-dump 2021-09-13 17:53:38 space folding is warp drive or worm hole which i just mentioned wouldnt work because if it was warp drive then if you try to run into something you will just kinda move through it
the-dump 2021-09-13 17:54:40 we should nationalize star wars so that we can elect people who will care about star wars

the-dump 2021-09-16 22:04:52 
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:06:52 thats what ive been saying this whole time
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:07:15 i know "anime is bad for you" seems like a boomer statement but honestly an excessive amount of anime probably is pretty bad for you
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:07:50 if you say shit like that your life is already ruined and you will never get a girlfriend so just be happy in whatever way to can man
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:08:59 a little bit is good, i like some anime on occasion, but honestly anime is too rewarding so your brain kinda gets accustomed to anime and it gets all weird
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:09:04 in theory though, just my personal theory B)
the-dump 2021-09-16 23:09:21 but yeah anime in moderation is perfectly fine obviously

the-dump 2021-12-31 22:54:43 why do people get so angry at furries while weebs exist
the-dump 2021-12-31 22:55:37 or a picture of an adult
the-dump 2021-12-31 22:59:14 how are weebs any cleaner than furries
the-dump 2021-12-31 22:59:27 weebs are dirtier as far as i can tell
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:00:23 fair
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:00:38 but furries are still higher up in society than weebs
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:01:56 modern day anime is 100% adult content
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:02:32 AAA
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:03:53 also just look at the ways that anime companies pull in the avid anime consumers
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:04:22 all the sussy shit, theres a reason anime invented 1000 year old dragons that look like literal infants
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:04:52 who tf do you think theyre marketing to with that
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:06:26 furries are weird and some of them are hella weird but at least there isnt such a large portion of them that are sussy that companies literally sell them sussy stuff
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:06:45 im just saying that furries are only better than weebs
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:07:05 at least most furries can go outside without getting sunburned within a minute
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:07:58 im defending the furry fandom in the context of them being compared to be worse than weebs
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:08:18 weebs do the same
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:08:57 oh you wer etalking about both
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:08:58 yeah
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:10:06 whats more pathetic in your eyes, a person who likes to pretend that theyre a cartoon animal, or somebody who pretends that theyre married to an anime character
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:10:42 they are both weirdos, but comparatively the furries are better
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:12:28 yes but on average if you meet a randomly selected weeb and furry, the weeb is more likely to be scary
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:13:30 especially if youre a woman meeting a weeb and a furry. like 90% of furries are gay so you're good. but WEEBS
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:13:36 thats a nightmare scenario
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:14:32 i watch anime too, there are a couple actually good ones. simply watching anime doesnt make you a weeb
the-dump 2021-12-31 23:27:12

the-dump 2022-01-16 19:06:04 ddlc+ aint worth the money though

the-dump 2022-01-16 19:06:49 its not, its an entirely different type of unfriendliness
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:07:04 well some of the cutscenes are kinda sussy
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:07:08 but not super sussy
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:07:52 and the finger sucking but thats because that one lady is a crazy bitch

the-dump 2022-01-16 19:23:38 which is bad marketing on part of the dev team but luckily for them a bunch of youtubers played it
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:23:50 or maybe good marketing who knows
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:24:18 theres a bunch of losers on the internet who would play it thinking its a normal dating game and then be sad or scared or something
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:24:54 no it aint
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:25:02 the only one who tries to kill you is like

the-dump 2022-01-16 19:25:47 ddlc is free
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:25:51 the original at least
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:25:57 ddlc+ is a scam
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:29:15 not accurate at all though
the-dump 2022-01-16 19:29:26 actually a little accurate

the-dump 2022-01-16 19:48:29 because the team that made the original ad said "the imagine going around has been tampered with" and idk why but that will never get old to me

the-dump 2022-01-17 02:05:46 you could make an nft 3d model or an nft video game
the-dump 2022-01-17 02:06:37 since the actual picture and whatever doesnt actually matter, the nft part is literally just a thing saying "i own this link" when the person who owns the server the link is to could just turn off the server

the-dump 2022-01-19 01:25:19 who doesnt have autism
the-dump 2022-01-19 16:58:49 Anti vaxers trollin the database
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:10:24 If those were genuine reports the cdc would investigate them
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:15:22 And besides the covid-19 vaccine wasnt created in under a year, its been under development for years and years before covid-19 even evolved. Since epidemiologists are actually pretty smart people believe it or not. One of the major suspects for the next pandemic were coronaviruses, and specific kinds which were most likely to jump to humans. So epidemiologists have been developing vaccine templates for coronaviruses for years, which is good for us because it means they already have safety testing and dont take years to develop for a specific virus
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:16:20 Fauci lied when he said masks dont work. He said that to prevent people from buying them all up so that health care workers could get them
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:17:20 And who cares if people who have comorbidities when they die of covid? Its like a guy with a broken leg got hit by a car and people blaming the broken leg for preventing the guy from running out of the way
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:17:34 They wouldnt have died if they didnt get covid
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:18:16 Why do you think we get flu vaccines even though the flu hardly kills anyone? Its because the flu kills people even if its people with comorbidities
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:18:42 Yes
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:21:35 Because evil scientists in super hero movies means real life scientists cant be trusted
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:24:09 Not for long since they seem to be naturally selecting against themselves
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:25:21 Actually it isnt good, if you have confirmation bias. Since that will lead you back to your own preconceived conclusion. If you know how to properly research and mitigate confirmation bias though, it can be good
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:25:32 People arent taught to properly do research though
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:26:15 Well, yes to conduct proper proper research you need a phd B)
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:27:13 If its something youre researching purely out of curiosity and arent thinking "vaccines PROBABLY give people ligma, lemme research real quick" then yes it can be good
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:28:24 Oh well duh of course
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:21:31 People also get the flu even when vaccinated. If you want a traditional vaccine get the j&j one
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:22:12 Yes
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:23:32 Also are you arguing that the vaccine doesnt work, or that its not safe? Im assuming that you think it doesnt work, since you didnt refute any of my points about it being safe
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:24:57 So youre saying we should just let tham die rather than prevent the metaphorical car from hitting them?
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:27:45 Wait so you think its better to do lockdowns to orevent then from getting in the metaphorical car?
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:27:49 Unexpectedly based
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:29:06 Metaphorical amputee has to cross the metaphorical road. You cant just lock away the people with autoimmune disease forever
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:30:44 Wait we're talking about effectiveness of vaccines right now right
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:18 Oh yeah
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:37 I agree that fat people should be not fat
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:44 Doesnt mean they deserve the death penalty
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:33:12 Well also the people dying are often older people, you cant exactly unage someone.
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:33:45 Hold on I'll be back in like 15 minutes since im boutta get off the bus
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:44:44 hAH i am now on my computer
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:44:56 i can make arguments far more effectively and with not nearly as many typos
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:45:08 wall of text time(as soon as i catch up on the lore)
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:51:53 Older people still have a difficult time with covid as youve acknowledged. if we have a chance to prevent them from getting covid then we should take it. and the people with comorbidities; often its not even obesity but to me that does not matter. they can strengthen their immune systems but as long as covid is around and kicking it will still infect and kill people, not to mention people with comorbidities likely wont take the measures to strengthen their immune system. vaccinations(as argued previously, are safe) are an easy way not only for those people to protect themselves, but people are less likely to catch and transmit covid if they are vaccinated(i can easily pull up statistics on that if you want)
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:52:09 tl;dr: vaccine good
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:07:12 AAAAA IVERMECTIN
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:11:54 Ivermectin being a good treatment for covid, vaccine being a trial medicine that we dont know the effects of. these are the only 2 things that you said that are incorrect and im only good at arguing when the person im arguing with says something wrong
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:12:09 everything else i agree with mostly except for everything that says "dont take the vaccine"
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:12:31 people do have the choice to take the vaccine and im not saying people should be forced to take the vaccine
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:13:06 but misinformation and misrepresentation of information causing people to not take the vaccine which puts them at an unnecessarily high risk are what im arguing against
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:13:52 people shouldnt die just because the person they got their info from was wrong. and saying that the vaccines are anywhere near as risky to get as covid is misrepresentation of information
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:14:18 say something please because i need to eat my cereal before it gets soggy
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:18:17 me and little rocket are allowed to keep arguing tho right

the-dump 2022-02-10 01:24:47 im training an ai to try to predict what plane crazy builds look like
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:25:35 im only training it on images from <#627195143040139264> and <#504718138399522832> B)
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:31:46 its a GAN, so unsupervised B)
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:32:28 i have colab pro so it can run for a while before google kicks me off their servers B)
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:32:42 GANs just take a long time to look good, but to be fair often never look good
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:33:02 also i only have 100 images so it will probably overfit and give me dumb data
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:33:12 it does
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:33:16 i downloaded them MANUALLY
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:33:18 :)
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:37:45 but total loss is slowly decreasing, though i will probably run out of time on google colab before things get really good

the-dump 2022-02-10 01:39:08 good idea
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:40:30 though i kinda want to see it accurately produce a background too
the-dump 2022-02-10 01:40:37 besides the background is the easiest part
the-dump 2022-02-10 02:43:49 yup, the ai definitely needs more data in order to do anything remotely good
the-dump 2022-02-10 02:44:15 so while i manually download and name like 200 more plane crazy creations im going to make it do something else B)

general 2022-02-20 21:00:38 finally
general 2022-02-20 21:01:26 wouldnt that just naturally happen, or do you mean making wing panels not produce as much lift if the planes are heavier?
general 2022-02-20 21:02:45 its like the wings are moving through syrup
general 2022-02-20 21:03:52 is the drag based on which direction the wing panels are facing? so if theyre facing flat against the wind they produce more drag than if theyre in line with the wind?
general 2022-02-20 21:05:03 you know how sky divers fall slower if theyre wide and spread out?
general 2022-02-20 21:05:08 more surface area facing the wind
general 2022-02-20 21:06:07 you mean if the wing is facing the wind it has less drag if it faces against the wind right?
general 2022-02-20 21:06:28 darn
general 2022-02-20 21:06:36 since thats super important for aerodynamics
general 2022-02-20 21:07:40 its how it works in pc1, and also it would make vertical stabilizers not work
general 2022-02-20 21:07:56 at least i think thats how it works in pc1
general 2022-02-20 21:08:59 thats what he meant you ooga booga nianderthal man
general 2022-02-20 21:15:36 Vertical stabilizers are the tail fins that go upwards
general 2022-02-20 21:16:13 I'm on mobile, somebody get this man a pic of what a vertical stabilizer is
general 2022-02-20 21:17:02 Its the fin that goes upwards on the tail

the-dump 2022-02-21 20:19:18 behold a redditor, points out the edits in his messages
the-dump 2022-02-22 00:45:53 what is abdm
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:46:43 actually theres people with both who arent infertile
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:47:45 but other than biological gender(im not allowed to say what its actually called because of a this servers filter), theres gender, which is how a boy can be feminine(femboy) or a girl can be masculine(tomboy)
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:48:52 so its not super hard to understand how you can differentiate biological and psychological gender when you point that out, but its definitely hard to understand if you dont think about that first
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:51:05 and thats also what leads to the more than 2 genders thing: since you can be more feminine or more masculine its sort of like a number spectrum, so specific genders are designated points along that number line sort of like how pi is a designated point somewhere around 3.14 on the number line
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:52:57 but personally i dont care about this stuff so im just a man man B)
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:54:28 uh, might wanna do more research on that before giving an answer that confidently
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:56:50 read the block of text above this message because i explained where the logic is derived from
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:57:20 ZAMN
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:13 about 0<=x<=1
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:46 have you read the block of text
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:12 have you read the block of text buddy man, i explained the logic that its derived from
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:52 a man can act feminine, a woman can act masculine, or you can act like a robot(genderless)
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:02 and areas in between, its not hard to understand
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:26 no, nonbinary is somewhere in between. besides genderless is a gender
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:01:11 how old are you?
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:03:07 
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:27:32 2 rational genders
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:27:37 infinite irrational genders
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:28:03 you probably want a tomboy gf
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:28:58 but yeah why are yall so sensitive about gender stuff, i laid out the logic so that its easy to understand
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:29:30 based on what logic
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:30:14 i mean sure those are the "biological genders"
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:30:37 but thats differentiated from psychological gender, where a man can be feminine and a woman can be masculine
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:31:31 if youre this sensitive about this stuff its probably more healthy for you to just ignore me
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:32:27 because youre desperately defending your already-held belief instead of trying to understand the logic of the other side, while clearly getting offended about it
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:35:29 personal preference since you cant objectively fit somebody to a point on the genderline since gender is completely constructed
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:36:52 but theres a decently well defined "masculine" and decently well defined "feminine" so you can create a sort of abstract spectrum between those 2 points, where youre more but not 100% feminine or masculine
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:37:07 but like i said i dont care about this stuff so im just a dude B)
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:38:25 its a social construct basically. if humans never differentiated males and females along an arbitrary "this is masculine, this is feminine", then gender wouldnt exist
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:38:38 because the logic is fun to play with
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:39:43 i mean, theres probably a correlation between how fr*nch and how gay people are
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:40:29 theres also a nationality spectrum since people often define themselves as "half french" and stuff
