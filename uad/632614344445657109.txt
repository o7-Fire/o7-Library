general 2023-02-13 23:26:32 ok
general 2023-02-13 23:26:37 at least tell me why?
general 2023-02-13 23:26:39 I assume its not a
general 2023-02-13 23:26:41 fixable thing
general 2023-02-13 23:26:54 if they dont work in the air
general 2023-02-13 23:26:58 I just wont be a shredder
general 2023-02-13 23:27:25 ok
general 2023-02-13 23:27:26 you know what
general 2023-02-13 23:27:36 that is an overreaction to me having
general 2023-02-13 23:27:40 a very well designed
general 2023-02-13 23:27:43 and very tactical
general 2023-02-13 23:27:47 craft
general 2023-02-13 23:27:49 you guys only rage
general 2023-02-13 23:27:51 because it kills you
general 2023-02-13 23:27:54 and dominates pvp
general 2023-02-13 23:28:02 they obliterate everything on the ground?
general 2023-02-13 23:28:03 yes
general 2023-02-13 23:28:04 they are
general 2023-02-13 23:28:10 they are elaborate and functional
general 2023-02-13 23:28:16 mostly shredder balls
general 2023-02-13 23:28:19 shredder bugs dont work very well
general 2023-02-13 23:28:39 ?
general 2023-02-13 23:29:08 a rotting nonce because I decided I want to have an easily usable
general 2023-02-13 23:29:09 functional
general 2023-02-13 23:29:13 killing machine
general 2023-02-13 23:29:15 on a PVP GAME
general 2023-02-13 23:29:18 hmm
general 2023-02-13 23:29:21 how dare I use something
general 2023-02-13 23:29:23 that actually works..
general 2023-02-13 23:29:24 thats
general 2023-02-13 23:29:26 so terrible
general 2023-02-13 23:29:28 god forbid
general 2023-02-13 23:29:34 thats the point?
general 2023-02-13 23:29:42 to make it so that its
general 2023-02-13 23:29:43 good?
general 2023-02-13 23:29:56 the input is the time I spent on creating the craft
general 2023-02-13 23:29:59 and trying to PVP
general 2023-02-13 23:30:03 there are people
general 2023-02-13 23:30:06 who spend 2 minutes
general 2023-02-13 23:30:07 making
general 2023-02-13 23:30:08 turrets
general 2023-02-13 23:30:12 to shoot down planes
general 2023-02-13 23:30:18 and they are reasonably effective (sometimes)
general 2023-02-13 23:30:41 you are screaming at me through a screen calling me a rotting nonce and a lazy shit because I use a game mechanic on a pvp game
general 2023-02-13 23:30:44 and?
general 2023-02-13 23:31:17 how immature do you have to be really
general 2023-02-13 23:31:19 I mean like
general 2023-02-13 23:31:22 you sound like you are 11
general 2023-02-13 23:31:39 "WAAAAH STOP USING SHREDDERS OHMYGOD!! WAAAAH"
general 2023-02-13 23:31:41 make anti shredder.
general 2023-02-13 23:31:47 Switch servers.
general 2023-02-13 23:31:51 ðŸ—¿
general 2023-02-13 23:31:54 better yet
general 2023-02-13 23:31:55 dont play
general 2023-02-13 23:31:59 ðŸ—¿
general 2023-02-13 23:32:09 why not
general 2023-02-13 23:32:13 reason
general 2023-02-13 23:32:13 give me a good
general 2023-02-13 23:32:34 ok?
general 2023-02-13 23:32:35 elaborate
general 2023-02-13 23:32:36 please
general 2023-02-13 23:32:40 elaborate further
general 2023-02-13 23:33:06 shredders have counterplay?
general 2023-02-13 23:33:08 wdym
general 2023-02-13 23:33:12 I have seen good anti shredder
general 2023-02-13 23:33:13 in fact today
general 2023-02-13 23:33:15 I met something
general 2023-02-13 23:33:17 I couldnt really beat
general 2023-02-13 23:33:21 Of course I dont want to say
general 2023-02-13 23:33:28 the thing I speak of was nearly indestructable
general 2023-02-13 23:33:31 even more cheap than a shredder
general 2023-02-13 23:33:48 anything nearly indestructable
general 2023-02-13 23:33:50 is bad
general 2023-02-13 23:33:52 shredders arent
general 2023-02-13 23:33:56 "nearly indestructable"
general 2023-02-13 23:34:00 shredders are easily destructable
general 2023-02-13 23:34:03 and dodgable
general 2023-02-13 23:35:42 the plane crazy community when people create functional pvp weapons on a pvp game:
general 2023-02-13 23:35:54 I was saying that as an "of course they do"
general 2023-02-13 23:36:05 I could say the same for planes
general 2023-02-13 23:36:08 planes are destructable
general 2023-02-13 23:36:09 just
general 2023-02-13 23:36:12 hard to get rid of
general 2023-02-13 23:36:13 ???
general 2023-02-13 23:36:58 ruins the fun of the game, as soon as someone makes something good even if it is not a shredder they can just votekick that person as there is no moderation
general 2023-02-13 23:37:04 plus
general 2023-02-13 23:37:07 would kill a lot of activity
general 2023-02-13 23:37:57 youd ban users for using game mechanics
general 2023-02-13 23:37:58 built in
general 2023-02-13 23:38:09 by 'cutters'
general 2023-02-13 23:38:16 truly the most logical game community
