creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:17:27 Yeah he literally copied it from the pictures
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:18:44 There’s no skill involved in that build
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:19:15 He had pictures and instructions
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:19:30 Even instructions on how to configure the thing and fly it
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:23:01 So you’re saying that the person is worthy enough to be recognized as a technician because he built a vtol with its instructions right in front of his face
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:24:34 Your judgement is fucked up
general 2019-01-03 17:28:20 I don’t see how that’s making fun of them
the-dump 2019-01-03 17:29:45 shut up
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 17:30:28 You’re not old enough to get any of those
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 18:08:36 We’re talking about where you copy a function of one block and then selecting all the other blocks at once and pasting it on them
the-dump 2019-01-03 18:10:12 sure sure
the-dump 2019-01-03 18:11:16 Ban
creations-chat 2019-01-03 18:13:15 Wow so you adding a few helium blocks to a youtube creation makes it technician worthy
