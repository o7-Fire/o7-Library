general 2020-11-23 00:00:45 most of modern guided weapons was made by germany in ww2
general 2020-11-23 00:01:54 imagine if this prototype completed
general 2020-11-23 00:01:55 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserfall
general 2020-11-23 00:02:09 it's a german sam prototype
general 2020-11-23 00:02:30 the allies would be fucked if germany anti air missile prototype success
general 2020-11-23 00:03:00 and how so
general 2020-11-23 00:03:06 lmao
general 2020-11-23 00:03:09 no air superiority
general 2020-11-23 00:03:12 = no win
general 2020-11-23 00:03:46 ok titanic listen, if germany prototype of anti air missile success they can end UK air superiority in middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:03:55 which will give them the ability to take over north africa
general 2020-11-23 00:03:57 and middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:03:59 for oil and iron
general 2020-11-23 00:04:22 erwin rommle: am i joke to u
general 2020-11-23 00:05:38 well if the prototype success within 43-42 so many things would be changed
general 2020-11-23 00:05:55 they tried
general 2020-11-23 00:05:59 but the prototype failed
general 2020-11-23 00:06:10 they also developed working anti ship missile
general 2020-11-23 00:06:14 a guided tho
general 2020-11-23 00:07:11 germany doesn't need to take UK
general 2020-11-23 00:07:18 all they would have tae is middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:07:19 take*
general 2020-11-23 00:07:37 but tehy failed due to british air forces
general 2020-11-23 00:08:23 true
general 2020-11-23 00:09:09 yes
general 2020-11-23 00:09:13 the failed prototype
general 2020-11-23 00:09:21 it worth
general 2020-11-23 00:10:09 well what im saying is, if AA misisle prototype success they could just use it to end allies air superiority on middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:10:17 then they can have planty of resources
general 2020-11-23 00:10:41 germany wouldn't declare war on USSR
general 2020-11-23 00:10:44 if they took
general 2020-11-23 00:10:46 middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:11:03 the main reason of operation barbarosa was the resources
general 2020-11-23 00:11:12 so if they got that in middle east
general 2020-11-23 00:11:22 they would'nt declare war on ussr
general 2020-11-23 00:12:19 well sound right that germany wouldn't win anyway
general 2020-11-23 00:12:28 gg you changed my view
general 2020-11-23 00:12:51 why germany would declare on turkey anyway
general 2020-11-23 00:13:24 they could just take iran instead it was weaker then turkey
