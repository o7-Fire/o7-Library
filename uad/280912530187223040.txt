plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:23:56 what are the new blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:25:28 it's still thicc
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:25:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:31:34 <@!340543153922768906>  how di you make that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:35:08 how did you make thaaaat
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:35:14 mercuyry is liek floating from nowhere
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:35:39 XDDDD
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 21:35:41 funny lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 20:50:21 yo the servvers are extremely laggy
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 20:57:59 how do you get a private server?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:08:25 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:08:31 hmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:02 :O????!?!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:04 woooooooah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:42 so yo ucan get ranks by just building omggg
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:50 what if you get 2 ranks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:52 {
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:09:52 like
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:10:06 woah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:10:09 awesome game
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:19:48 yo rockets  aren't working
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:20:08 I mean t hey are buggy
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:20:10 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:20:18 thgey were also buggy in a no pvp server
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:21:20 geez
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:21:37 I made a rocket that dissasembles while throwing bombs
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:21:41 and it isn't flying
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:21:55 it jsut falls to the grownd like if the rockets gave no propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:23:18 yo when I activate the rockets
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:23:30 they give propulsion for like 1 seconds and then their propulsion gets to 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:26:37 yooooooooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:26:39 they dont' woerk
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:27:17 
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:27:24 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:27:27 le me add fuel
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:27:32 cuz I just enabled that thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:24 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:27 duee don't call me noob
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:30 you ignorant
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:34 in the other creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:37 I had fuel
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:40 IN the rocket
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:45 and
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:47 and
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:53 it fell down likfe if nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:28:56 and the rocekts lagged
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:29:04 yo
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:29:13 also the fuel thing is like glithced
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:29:21 because if you have fuel
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:29:24 and then you dissconect it
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:29:31 it still counts as fuel in your creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:30:47 <@!238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:30:55 
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:31:46 the rocket isn't moving
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:31:49 with tons of fuel
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:31:51 available
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:32:04 and the problem isn't friciton
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:32:11 because it worked 20 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:33:30 still happens
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 21:36:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:28:41 because my train derails
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:28:45 just in that right spot
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:01 I tried 5 different mechanisms for the conenction between the wheels and the car
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:07 and still doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:15 so just saying that suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:29 Should I?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:38 yes and no
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:44 I should put it in the right channel
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:52 but I'm not for your chains
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:59 yeah but not mine
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:31:01 yo I mean an specific part
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:22:02 yo
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:22:09 for microscopic engineer
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:22:25 is it necessary to have the main pilot seat *on* the 5 block plane?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:24:18 I know
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:32:48 yo I'm sick of pistons
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:32:54 they always bug when you use them
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 02:29:47 yo
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 02:29:51 why my rockets never work
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 02:29:52 ):
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 02:30:33 when I activate them they give propulsion but then they give nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 02:34:31 yooooooo why my rockets are bugging
help 2019-05-24 02:38:00 yo my rockets bug all the time
help 2019-05-24 02:38:11 when I start them the stop giving propulsion
help 2019-05-24 02:38:20 I use them in some missiles
help 2019-05-24 02:38:50 and whenever I dissconect them the missile stays still for some miliseconds and then falls with no propulsion being given by the rockets
help 2019-05-24 02:38:55 whyyyyyyyy
help 2019-05-24 02:40:04 I'm so frustratd of the hard work I've done in this big train and even more the engineering for the wheels and the missiles, and just now, things turn the oher side. I had never experienced this before, I even made other missiles in the same way and they worked perfectly
help 2019-05-24 02:40:09 both
help 2019-05-24 02:40:26 they have the same issue in on/off abled or not
help 2019-05-24 02:40:30 I
help 2019-05-24 02:40:32 Know
help 2019-05-24 02:40:36 I don't mean that
help 2019-05-24 02:40:38 I press
help 2019-05-24 02:40:39 and press
help 2019-05-24 02:40:41 all the time
help 2019-05-24 02:40:49 yo I'm not that noob
help 2019-05-24 02:41:07 :o
help 2019-05-24 02:41:10 there's something
help 2019-05-24 02:41:59 
help 2019-05-24 02:42:37 ye
help 2019-05-24 02:42:56 
help 2019-05-24 02:44:20 theoretically, that mechanism wouldn't move..
help 2019-05-24 02:45:18 so what's up with my rockets?
help 2019-05-24 02:45:30 after they "turn off" they don't give any propulsion
help 2019-05-24 02:45:49 even if I start them or stop them repeatedly they won't give nothing
help 2019-05-24 02:46:00 same with on/off dissabled
help 2019-05-24 02:46:08 they still don't do nothing
help 2019-05-24 02:46:21 oh there's also another one
help 2019-05-24 02:47:01 
help 2019-05-24 02:47:50 rather than bug finding I need help to avoid the problem
bug-reports 2019-05-24 02:58:06 
bug-reports 2019-05-24 02:58:10 
bug-reports 2019-05-24 02:58:11 
bug-reports 2019-05-24 02:58:30 I get those things when I activate the rockets on my train
bug-reports 2019-05-24 02:58:53 they're supported by a platform that elevates with pistons and motors (as edges)
bug-reports 2019-05-24 03:00:07 
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:07:28 yo I'm starting to hate this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:07:33 it gets worse everyday
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:08:10 first my mechanisms bug
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:08:17 second, rockets don't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:08:30 third, they never work well
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:08:52 reading the dev console it looks like it's a game issue
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:09:00 I can't build my things
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:09:03 because they don't work properly
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:09:08 I can't build anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:09:22 without getting dissapointed of the unexpected result
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:11:26 now dissconectors have the same issue
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:15:15 also my saves got bugged and mixed
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:16:07 yo
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:16:14 where do I get the lsit of the bug fixes?
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:17:15 I need the exact bugs
general 2019-09-26 22:32:13 yo
general 2019-09-26 22:32:26 they still don't fix a bug I posted soem time ago
general 2019-09-26 22:32:28 sad life
general 2019-09-26 22:34:49 no one told me about it
general 2019-09-26 22:34:50 dammit
general 2019-09-26 22:35:05 where do I get the thing
general 2019-09-26 22:35:20 also why do you tell me I didn't
general 2019-09-26 22:35:45 yo usay it because you saw I didn't do that thing exactly? or just because they haven't done the fix?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 20:43:19 hey buds
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 20:43:22 where's the egg? XD
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 23:55:26 do cameras still have a weight?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 23:56:25 wait what, yo ucan make blocks not to stick in certain parts?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 00:02:06 mota lock?
bug-reports 2020-04-28 00:22:40 Damn... my game keeps crashing suddenly T.T
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 02:12:45 how do I grab teh egg?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 02:13:37 Thanks
general 2021-08-26 23:27:41 yo
general 2021-08-26 23:27:45 whbat happened to the elon musk role
general 2021-08-26 23:27:53 I mean the ultimate rocket scientist level
general 2021-08-26 23:27:58 ya but why change
general 2021-08-26 23:28:04 now it's  ridiculous
general 2021-08-26 23:28:07 dude
general 2021-08-26 23:28:09 4k blocks rovkets
general 2021-08-26 23:28:11 that's stupid easy
general 2021-08-26 23:28:21 why even change
general 2021-08-26 23:28:32 it was fewer ranks
general 2021-08-26 23:28:33 bruh
general 2021-08-26 23:28:35 now there's lioke 6
general 2021-08-26 23:28:39 there were 5 bnefore
general 2021-08-26 23:28:42 with the elon rank
general 2021-08-26 23:29:07 what d oyo umean
general 2021-08-26 23:29:10 there are 6
general 2021-08-26 23:29:11 not 5
general 2021-08-26 23:29:22 yea
general 2021-08-26 23:29:26 but I'm talking about rocket roles
general 2021-08-26 23:29:30 they're all dumb
general 2021-08-26 23:29:31 like all the others
general 2021-08-26 23:29:45 I mean dude why have all 6 ranks the same crap
general 2021-08-26 23:29:49 why not add complexity
general 2021-08-26 23:30:05 ya but it's boring and dumb
general 2021-08-26 23:30:16 no
general 2021-08-26 23:30:19 I'm talking about rocket ranks
general 2021-08-26 23:30:22 not 6
general 2021-08-26 23:30:22 tehre were 5
general 2021-08-26 23:30:26 dudde 6
general 2021-08-26 23:30:28 more
general 2021-08-26 23:30:29 than before
general 2021-08-26 23:30:33 then why do you talk about rioles in general
general 2021-08-26 23:30:51 no tf why are you even talking to me then
general 2021-08-26 23:30:57 I'm talking about rocket roles
general 2021-08-26 23:31:00 not youre opinion
general 2021-08-26 23:31:29 bruh no one cared about that role
general 2021-08-26 23:31:34 that's why there's no one to want it back
general 2021-08-26 23:31:36 yea
general 2021-08-26 23:31:40 no one also cares about the other roles
general 2021-08-26 23:31:43 so wjhyu not delete them too?
general 2021-08-26 23:32:03 yea really easy roles
general 2021-08-26 23:32:06 ofc everyone will have it
general 2021-08-26 23:32:09 200 blocks creations
general 2021-08-26 23:32:54 x
general 2021-08-26 23:32:59 you could just have level 1-5 roles
general 2021-08-26 23:33:06 and replace beginner-master roles
general 2021-08-26 23:33:12 I mean
general 2021-08-26 23:33:21 it's dumb to say that
general 2021-08-26 23:33:28 doesn't have to do
general 2021-08-26 23:33:35 too large of a gap?
general 2021-08-26 23:33:39 how does that correlate
general 2021-08-26 23:34:27 bruh
general 2021-08-26 23:34:38 roles now are just add more blocks
general 2021-08-26 23:34:39 nothing else
general 2021-08-26 23:34:45 yea
general 2021-08-26 23:34:48 jsut add more blocks
general 2021-08-26 23:34:52 get lucky to have enoughj likes
general 2021-08-26 23:34:57 and you got it in hall
general 2021-08-26 23:35:29 like bruh
general 2021-08-26 23:35:52 there are meme creations of barly any block that get 100+ likes
general 2021-08-26 23:35:56 reason?
general 2021-08-26 23:36:03 the creator was known
general 2021-08-26 23:36:11 yea they were
general 2021-08-26 23:36:14 they had several roles
general 2021-08-26 23:36:18 iuncludid non-rank roles
general 2021-08-26 23:36:44 so you're saying that the community doesn't want anyone to have high ranks?
general 2021-08-26 23:36:52 like they envy their work?
general 2021-08-26 23:37:04 that's what they just said
general 2021-08-26 23:37:14 yea that's the problem
general 2021-08-26 23:37:35 you can't tell everybody to have the same parameters of defining whbat's an upvote and what's adownvote
general 2021-08-26 23:37:42 I jus said that
general 2021-08-26 23:37:50 so that's why you practically rely on luck
general 2021-08-26 23:37:57 yes you do
general 2021-08-26 23:40:34 so as you asked me to asnwer
general 2021-08-26 23:40:52 this implies that if people knew that meme roles give ranks, then they wouldn't upvote
general 2021-08-26 23:41:42 WHy would you even say that then
general 2021-08-26 23:42:44 no I wanted to have solid reason of why were old ranks removed
general 2021-08-26 23:43:35 I didn't ask for why do we have so many roles
general 2021-08-26 23:43:58 you said that we had way too many roles, which didn't have anything to do, and becuase of that, roles were re written
general 2021-08-26 23:45:42 What did you mean with this then
general 2021-08-26 23:45:56 I said that there were 5 rocket rtoles before, and now 6, then you said that
general 2021-08-26 23:46:52 I said I was talking about rocket roles several times
general 2021-08-26 23:46:59 That doesn't make any sense
general 2021-08-26 23:47:19 Then why even bother answering
general 2021-08-26 23:47:25 If you weren't going to talk about rocket roles
general 2021-08-26 23:47:32 Why bother trying to answer my question
general 2021-08-26 23:47:42 of why were rocket roles rewritten
general 2021-08-26 23:47:49 that's not valid
general 2021-08-26 23:48:37 you can't say that your answer is validbecuse you think it can be valid if you don't care about my question
general 2021-08-26 23:48:48 6+24x
general 2021-08-26 23:49:56 1522+42x-42x^2
general 2021-08-26 23:50:24 so I can say that your answe is not valid because it's a opinion?
general 2021-08-26 23:50:25 5
general 2021-08-26 23:51:53 It's hypocritical to question my age yet trashtalk for most of the time
general 2021-08-26 23:53:40 you can't solve that
general 2021-08-26 23:53:52 it had different and special requirements
general 2021-08-26 23:53:56 for completion of the rank
general 2021-08-26 23:54:21 I wonder why remove the special requiremens
general 2021-08-26 23:54:28 when barely any one has the role
general 2021-08-26 23:54:46 no I mean barely anyone has rocket role X
general 2021-08-26 23:55:03 You cna't find x
general 2021-08-26 23:55:11 you don'thav the value of x
general 2021-08-26 23:55:23 you have an equation depending on x
general 2021-08-26 23:55:27 like bruh
general 2021-08-26 23:55:33 you want to do math?
general 2021-08-26 23:57:12 Given a function g(x), find the maximum values of g with this:
general 2021-08-26 23:57:37 Show proof of your answer
general 2021-08-26 23:57:40 not a calcualtor
general 2021-08-26 23:57:43 <:troleadorcara:803434094276902922>
general 2021-08-26 23:58:11 you are saying that 25x+105=0
general 2021-08-26 23:58:17 but you didn't write that in the messahe
general 2021-08-26 23:58:33 v
general 2021-08-26 23:58:35 
general 2021-08-26 23:58:38 there's n = sign
general 2021-08-26 23:58:40 like bruh
general 2021-08-26 23:58:46 you just made it euqal to 0
