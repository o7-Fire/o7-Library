The Tale of CaptDanger (803144144226615338)
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 18:40:55 I thought it took the most complicated build ever for the hall of fame
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 18:42:43 Is it true that people in here are cruel in judging
general 2023-01-06 14:40:24 im not sure how to feel about befriending kaspa and only figuring out hes well known after a week
general 2023-01-06 14:41:04 i wanted people to rate my stallion
general 2023-01-06 14:41:30 and he just came up and said.. "give me your discord" and then he showed me his friends stallion
general 2023-01-06 14:41:32 for ref pic

general 2023-01-07 12:56:08 guys, how do i record a good plane crazy video that gets views. i have an F-14 but i dont know how im supposed to showcase it
general 2023-01-07 12:56:39 i tried to showcase my f-18
general 2023-01-07 12:56:42 it came out like shit
general 2023-01-07 12:57:08 it is.. i dont know how to edit
general 2023-01-07 12:57:14 thats a big problem for me
general 2023-01-07 12:57:47 bruh i aint never coming back to pcc for help ðŸ˜­
general 2023-01-17 14:30:36 i made a hawker hurricane.. but for some reason i cant post pics
general 2023-01-17 14:31:09 what
general 2023-01-17 14:31:37 joe
general 2023-01-17 14:32:54 can someone explain why i cant post pictures
general 2023-01-17 14:34:04 end me
bot-central 2023-01-17 14:34:29 !rank
bot-central 2023-01-17 14:34:35 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:03:57 Only God can save that shit ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:05:55 No shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:06:02 I was just saying, it looked janky
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:06:28 I am never saying anything in pcc again I swear to god
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:07:03 I didn't, it just looked funny
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:31 Now I know how people build good stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:44 The only difference is the angle on top and on the bottom
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:55 Bottom angle needs to angle more
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:27:13 And there needs to be space between the spine and cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:27:27 Instead of just a full angle
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:29:54 And also the back of the spine ends earlier than what you have there
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:03 There's a flat area at the end of the spine
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:19 How do people do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:31:01 Yeah, but angle the bottom more
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:15 Bro I wish I could build like this, there is one person I know who can build like that and he won't teach me for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:42 I'm stuck at a point where I'm learning nothing new and my builds look kind of decent
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:50 No, like methods
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:56 I'm familiar with all kinds of lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:20 Way better
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:57 Not stealing, I just see that all the time
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:35:44 Everytime I come to build something, I can never figure out the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:35:50 What's a trick to getting good noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:39:21 I'm struggling with heli noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:39:36 Like the chinook
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:40:11 The problem is im a roscale builder, and unfourtunelty I've gotten used to it
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:40:33 Every build I make it 3 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:40:40 It's a pain in the ass to do heli noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:09 My latest build is a hurricane
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:12 And uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:22 It hasn't gotten positive reviews by good builders
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:46 3 wide I use for heli's
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:56 3 wide includes intakes for jets
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:40 I made a 3 wide stallion.. It's uh, intresting
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:43 But I made it work
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:43:17 I saw sticknubs stallion in person
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:43:21 Fucking huge
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:24 Ah
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:37 Can you rate my hurricane rq
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:41 It's unpainted
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:44 Tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:45:03 Wtf ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:45:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:01 They're average ðŸ˜¤
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:12 I thought roscale was player scalr

plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:26:55 imagine we could do this but for way smaller builds
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:28:30 you know i hate to point fingers but... <@826634763959664640> ðŸ™„
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:29:10 there could have been a better emoji for this
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:29:48 i got 5 heart attacks in the process of installing them ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:30:37 yeah, i did
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:30:58 it took me like an hour to get it running
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:31:09 windows kept deleting it
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:31:17 then i had to figure out the key thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:31:30 then got banned for an hour when i got it running
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:31:50 i woke up the next morning.. windows apparently has dementia
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:31:56 IT DELETED IT

plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:33:18 bro i watched 4 videos and looked at 8 reddit posts before i installed krnl
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:33:31 your shaders were really good but its soooo tiring to get them
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:34:12 
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:34:19 looked amazing on my carrier too
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:35:33 the sun changes the shaders alot
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:36:11 nah thats what the roshade experience is
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:36:25 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:36:32 except for with big builds, they dip a bit
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:38:01 like, infinite infinite or just they look that way
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:38:08 cus that could be realllyyyy confusing
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:39:36 roshade makes the ground wet
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:39:42 its so bad
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:41:04 bro, it makes the game run at -50 fps
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:42:41 ong
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:43:27 i wish i could get your shaders without all the pain
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:45:55 this is starting to feel like an ad
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:46:49 bro i got like 50 views on my last video for some reason, my previous got like 1k
plane-crazy 2023-02-11 07:46:53 im growing horribly
