help 2022-04-06 11:17:14 I ever built a seaplane before, except it keeps being more bouncier than an average anime girl (I'm sorry for being a clown, this joke isn't funny)
help 2022-04-06 11:17:34 Something like that, yes.
help 2022-04-06 11:18:01 I recommend you just use normal blocks and get creative instead of using pontoon blocks, kinda annoying to configure and is less bouncier
