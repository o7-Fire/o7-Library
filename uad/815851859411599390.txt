bug-reports 2023-01-15 08:58:07 There is an odd bug with the signs where if you click the text on a sign with the paint brush you can edit it to whatever you want even stuff that should get tagged. I have a video of it but I can't send videos here on discord
bug-reports 2023-01-15 09:04:16 Not with the screw driver, the paint brush also I don't think they want swearing on the signs
bug-reports 2023-01-15 09:08:51 Yea I know it can be fixed cuz ERLC has the same bug and they fixed it
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:37:59 I can't send vids I don't have notro
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:38:37 Don't you need nitro to send videos on discord?
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:40:02 Well I can't use the button to send the video but
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:40:22 No

bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:41:06 I can just describe it
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:41:31 You can edit the text but instead of the screw driver it is the paint brush and you can swear

bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:42:46 The screw driver works fine it's the paint brush that's broken
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:43:19 Yes the screw driver opens the menu
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:44:05 Oh no the paint brush doesn't open the menu
bug-reports 2023-01-15 12:44:33 Ok
