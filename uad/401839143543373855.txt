plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:37:03 Can the devs make a symmetry tool in the game please?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:37:26 why?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:37:34 ik
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:37:48 But it would be better to have a symmetry tool
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:38:10 btw it's Dan not Dan1
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 01:38:13 Dani
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:57:34 Can the devs add a higher amount of pvp weapons such as guns?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:57:52 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:58:25 I made the USS Kidd and weaponized it and it is so fun destroying other things with it.

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:24:02 Well they lost both world wars
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:24:17 exaclty
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:25:01 So if you are on the Germans' side, then you would always loose because you poorly strategize.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:25:18 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:25:30 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:25:37 are battles
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:25:51 But it's all part of a war
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:26:06 so the US wins
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:26:14 e yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:26:47 idk
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:27:43 ah yes and idc

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:33:53 It's very simple
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:35:04 and then suspend Roblox's process for around 12 seconds.
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:35:11 and then resume it
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:35:19 and then it's finished
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:35:25 NOPE
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:35:28 yeah

creations-chat 2020-03-18 18:08:50 The USS Kidd has 3683 blocks and the USS North Carolina has 4710 blocks

bot-central 2020-03-18 19:27:10 !rank
help 2020-03-18 19:34:20 Also, how do I post a suggestion?
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:09:51 <@!476629966780497931> the USS Kidd has a mast that is not mad out of cylinders because there aren't any helium cylinders. Also if I would increase the size of the turrets I would then have to redo all of the ship so it would look good
creations-chat 2020-03-19 04:58:49 ik
creations-chat 2020-03-19 04:59:10 I already know that problem existed
creations-chat 2020-03-19 04:59:30 It's just that I have already reached the block save data limit.
creations-chat 2020-03-19 04:59:33 😦
creations-chat 2020-03-19 04:59:54 I wish it was a lot higher
creations-chat 2020-03-19 05:00:04 (the block save data limit)
general 2020-03-25 00:52:29 okay
general 2020-03-25 00:52:50 I did not know that; sorry
the-dump 2020-03-25 00:55:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q1vsX6vSMc
general 2020-03-25 20:59:46 yes
general 2020-03-25 21:00:39 I tried making a Halo inspired ship that was a destroyer but it was too big that I went through some blocks
general 2020-03-25 21:00:43 :C
general 2020-03-25 21:00:59 It was too big for the game engine
general 2020-03-25 21:01:03 I guess
general 2020-03-25 21:01:20 yeah
general 2020-03-25 21:01:31 It is very wide and tall
general 2020-03-25 21:02:08 I tried making it crash on a planet by turning the ship off and I was lagging a lot
general 2020-03-25 21:02:16 once it hit the ground
general 2020-03-25 21:02:36 sometimes it goes through the ground when it falls
general 2020-03-25 21:03:24 I built another ship that is also big but much more downscales
general 2020-03-25 21:03:30 downscaled*
general 2020-03-25 21:03:54 Now in Plane Crazy I am trying to make the USS Yorktown CV-10
general 2020-03-25 21:04:02 I almost finished it
general 2020-03-25 21:04:27 But I have a small amount of block save data left
general 2020-03-25 21:04:43 So I have to probably delete some things
general 2020-03-25 21:05:19 Also it was kind of hard building it since there are some blocks I needed that DON'T EXIST IN THE GAME
general 2020-03-25 21:05:47 I just wish there is more variety of the blocks
general 2020-03-25 21:05:56 like helium cylinder beams
general 2020-03-25 21:06:06 but for some reason people hate that
general 2020-03-25 21:06:08 :C
general 2020-03-25 22:59:43 <@163143541160148992>  I need helium cylinders to make my ships look better because I use helium beams/blocks for the masts and it would look better if I would use helium cylinders. Also I don't have any gamepasses in the game.
general 2020-03-25 22:59:55 What
general 2020-03-25 23:00:10 Oh
general 2020-03-25 23:00:33 This game needs more variety of blocks
general 2020-03-25 23:01:35 Why
general 2020-03-25 23:01:56 Yeah
general 2020-03-25 23:05:57 What if the community can make some additions of the map and then somehow implement it into the already made map
general 2020-03-25 23:06:21 Mk
general 2020-03-25 23:07:08 Wot does henk mean
general 2020-03-26 00:03:08 Well I just wish there was more variety of the blocks in the game.
general 2020-03-26 00:03:30 So tgen building certain curves would be possible
general 2020-03-26 00:03:48 Well I can't do that
general 2020-03-26 00:03:55 Then*
general 2020-03-26 00:04:19 Because I am not a modler or a developer of the game
bot-central 2020-03-27 03:39:38 okay
bot-central 2020-03-27 03:40:10 well putting a feature where you can add decals to objects is a suggestion

help 2020-04-03 16:51:22 Hello! I made a conveyor elevator for my aircraft carrier to raise and lower aircraft and it works perfectly fine when raising or lowering nothing and lowering other people's aircraft. However, whenever I raise someone else's aircraft, it "bounces" but does not glitch out; how do I fix this problem? (also btw all of this requires for me to be anchored).
help 2020-04-03 17:19:37 oh
help 2020-04-03 17:20:05 /well I tried pistons but they glitch out worse than the conveyor elevator I made
