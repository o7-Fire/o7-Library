plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:29:57 How do you get the overlay of blocks which makes builds easier to build on?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:32:11 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:18 ok so i finished the legs of 1 of my mechs but idk how to build waist/hips properly, any tips?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:10:55 So i'm building a giant mech but i'm not so sure on how to build the hips/waist
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:11:09 can i dm anyone my design and get feedback?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:11:48 oki
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:25:11 I cant think of anything to build. First answer is what i'll build
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:26:43 Ok sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:27:00 i've never really built tanks before so i guess i better get started

plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:31:13 Do corner wedge 1x2 exist? I've looked for awhile haven't found any. Would be really useful because the roofs of the house I'm making are made from 1x2 wedges.

Thanks!!
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:33:37 Looking good!!
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:35:32 Wasn't the type of block i was looking for - my fault. Like a sort of 1x2 corner wedge in? Can i dm anyone so i can send a picture of the block i need?
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:36:54 Yikes, well i don't really know what's going to happen with my roof now. Thanks anyway
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:38:38 Nice!
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 04:40:48 Can i dm someone anyway? I really need help with my roof.
help 2022-02-17 04:44:14 Just realized i could be posting here instead, oops. Can i dm anyone about my roof? I'm finding it very difficult to blend the two of them.
creations-chat 2022-02-19 03:00:02 This might literally be one of the best planes i've ever seen, congrats on making it i guess.
creations-chat 2022-02-19 03:03:13 If that's model standards then my builds are pieces of hot garbage (Same to you FleetOfRetribution)
