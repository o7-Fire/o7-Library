general 2022-08-17 06:41:41 May I take a look?
general 2022-08-17 06:43:14 There’re 2 major reasons:
1/ Wings are not mirrored
2/ Thrust of one engine is greater or less than another (only applicable if your jet is a twin engines one). You have to check if the engines you use are even

creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:14:11 Does this convince you?
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:17:07 Cuz Tomcat is gone, and F35 can’t carry weapons externally.
The Navy planned to accompany the Tomcat and the Hornet as partners. But the budget was cut after ussr oofed.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:19:37 Integrated fuel tank, upgraded radar, equipped with enclosed weapon pod, Super Hornet BLK IiI can carry 3 of its.

And in response and as an add on, F35 don’t carry weapon externally if it want to maintain it stealth.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:22:05 Logical, the plane is stealth, but not the weapons
You either choose external weapons in exchange of stealth.
Or stealth in exchange of external weapons.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:24:27 A 4th or 4.5th gen can do the job at a cheaper cost, then why should you let a 5th gen to do it?
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:29:23 I understand your point. Sometimes there’re situation that allow 5th gen to carry weapon externally.
But in general, and as I mentioned, 4th or 4.5th gen can do the job at a lower cost. 4.5th gen are fighter that adopted some of the 5th gen requirements in the design. Fuselage of 4th gen, but engines and technology from 5th genTherefore, make it an existence between 4th and 5th gen. F15EX, F/A18 Super Hornet Block III, Dassault Rafale, KF-21, Su-35 are the example
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:31:30 Not the US, but Lockheed Martin, they’re the one who manufacture and profit from it.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:34:35 The complexity of the structure makes the maintenance a pain in the ass, plus that thing weigh 800kg, equal to 2x MK83 1000lbs bombs. Dogfighting with 2x 1000lbs bombs tied to your jet is not a good idea.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:41:14 The B1 has the advantage of speed, obviously, powered by 4x General Electric F101 turbofan afterburner engines. As well as payload. But as a bomber designed from the last century, it focuses on breaching enemy’s air defense through low altitude and supersonic. Which obviously, doesn’t work as well as it used to be nowadays. And as mentioned, maintaining the swept wings is pain. However I think they retire the B1 to give space for the B21.

general 2022-08-20 02:19:24 Frederick is a pretty classic Germanic name, means “Peaceful Ruler” according to some name translator site.
“von”, means “of”, usually only for nobles.

general 2022-08-20 02:31:42 Welcome to the clown show.
creations-chat 2022-08-20 04:59:48 This gun is… idk what to say, a little better than the HK416 cuz 2800 of default muzzle velocity is higher than HK416’s 2500.
creations-chat 2022-08-20 05:56:00 According to the blueprint, the width of the intake appears to be 1/2 the width of the canopy. Therefore, if the nose is 3 blocks wide, then the intake should be 1.5 block wide, but does it look like it tho? I feel like the width is 2/3 the width of the canopy.
creations-chat 2022-08-20 06:13:54 So, does it look close to the blueprint? I don’t trust my eyes
creations-chat 2022-08-20 06:18:47 So, if my nose is 3 blocks wide, then the 1.5 intake would work
help 2022-08-21 07:18:20 Apparently, you cannot achieve dual keybinds control of the elevator by putting 2 motor 2 head to head… which I understand, pain in the ass.
In order to solve this, I have 2 options for you:
One: instead of using 1 key to control 1 movement, such as W to pitch up. You can try to use 2 keys. Instead of placing W/S as the key bind, you can try W/A for one and S/D for another. So if you want to pitch you press 2 keys like W and D or S and A. If you want to roll using elevator, you can press W and S for left or A and D for right.
Second option is more complex while building and looks bad but you won’t have to reset your muscle memory, you can use a set of locked motor, place vertically, attack one motor 2 controlling W/S or A/D, doesn’t matter, to the one head of the motor lock and another motor for W/S if you placed A/D before already, or A/D if you placed W/S before already. Then attack panels to the outer motor 2 and it should solve the problem.
general 2022-08-21 07:54:08 Japan’s POV: nothing happened.
China when Japan says nothing happened: there will be bloodshed.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:16:02 I wonder where did I go wrong with the nose…
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:22:16 Making the tomcat, but the nose, I can’t describe, it’s like too chunky. And it’s a 3 wide
bug-reports 2022-08-25 06:06:11 Rick, I hope you see this and fix this issue. I used the same setting for 4 motors, but when I spawn in and angle lock them, they all rotate at different rate, like, not united at all. Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely.

general 2022-08-25 06:08:51 I spent 4 days on the nose and canopy, and 3 days on the intake

general 2022-08-25 06:09:46 Apparently, no
general 2022-08-25 06:11:23 I submitted pic of my F18 to be ranked, and I used no helium block in the plane, but the mod keep asking me for the pic of helium block count.
general 2022-08-25 06:12:22 It’s just not applicable to me, cuz I didn’t used one single helium block in the plane
general 2022-08-25 06:12:55 Send them the plane in build mode?
general 2022-08-25 06:13:22 They ask for the helium block count
general 2022-08-25 06:14:57 So just send them the plane in build mode and tell them no helium block had been used?
general 2022-08-25 06:16:51 Ok, all methods were denied, what do you want me to do?
general 2022-08-25 06:17:01 Or do you have any solution?
general 2022-08-25 06:17:16 Oh yeah

1/ As mentioned, nam nam jets’s users will suffer
2/ Shredder might become even more dangerous
3/ ro-scale pvp would potentially be common

help 2022-11-21 06:39:02 POV: That’s how Goose died
help 2022-11-21 06:41:03 Compressor stall: a situation which the compressor components failed to compress air to a pre-calculated pressure, which caused the airflow to be redirected back forward
help 2022-11-21 06:43:30 Basically the compressor cannot compress air to a pre calculated pressure, so the air cannot continue to advance into the ignition chamber, which then caused the process to be disrupted, boom, dead engine. You would rather want both engines to die at the same time, cuz due to the design, the remaining engine will generate an unbalance torque which will force the aircraft into an uncontrollable flat spin. Or in short: That was how Goose died
help 2022-11-21 06:44:27 I’m a materialist, so I stick with Girls Frontline, foreseeable future

help 2022-11-21 06:52:31 The earlier Hornet
help 2022-11-21 06:53:24 Early Hornet has one fatal design flaw
help 2022-11-21 06:53:57 The edge wing create a turbulence flow which directly impacts the root of rudders
help 2022-11-21 06:54:35 Which will cause metal distress to the airframe
help 2022-11-21 06:54:56 Which tiny thing?
help 2022-11-21 06:56:06 They either added a heck tons of propeller engines to help with maneuvering, or they simply light and have great thrust to weight ratio
help 2022-11-21 06:56:23 The extruded fin thingy?
help 2022-11-21 06:57:34 That’s the fin blade, which serves the purpose to help redirect the turbulence flow generated by the edge wings away from the root of the rudder to avoid distress, a compensation to the aerodynamic specialty but also a flaw of the early Hornet
help 2022-11-21 07:02:27 And so Boeing redesigned the Hornet, change the intake from the early oval shape to the Galette intake (also used by the Raptor), new F414, and larger wing surfaces and a new edge wing design, which completely redirected the turbulence flow away from the root of rudder without the existence of fin blade. But it also caused disruption to the airflow under the wings, weapons now have a chance to collide into the fuselage while dropping. Boeing’s solution to that: angle the weapon racks for 3 degrees. Avoided that risk, but in exchange of terrible drag.
help 2022-11-21 07:03:17 Basic

help 2022-11-21 07:05:36 Rate of turning
help 2022-11-21 07:07:23 That’s physically un-achievable irl, but since this is PC, you can simply add another set of hover engines which provided reversing thrust
help 2022-11-21 07:08:03 However I do not guarantee the rate of success
help 2022-11-21 07:09:32 Applying gun like that is no difference from trying to take down a fly using a cannon
help 2022-11-21 07:10:10 First, you have to acknowledge one thing: guns in PC suck in aerial combat
help 2022-11-21 07:10:40 More drop than they supposed to
help 2022-11-21 07:11:42 The real bullets that do damage have way more drop, terrible mechanism, always turn your opponent’s vehicle into a Wonder Woman’s one
help 2022-11-21 07:12:31 I still use some in case of emergency
help 2022-11-21 07:13:08 Better to have some than to have none in case of unexpected

help 2022-11-22 06:55:55 Plus, to an extent, how the heck wing can still generate lift even the speed is 0 or it was simply Rick considers wing has no mass? Or perhaps he programmed wings to generate way more lift than it suppose to?
help 2022-11-23 04:43:56 You indicating it pitches up and down at snail speed?
help 2022-11-23 04:44:15 Mind post a picture?
help 2022-11-23 04:47:05 That makes it clear, it is necessary to have sufficient elevator’s surface area to alter air flow in order to maneuver the plane
help 2022-11-23 04:49:51 You’re left with 3 options:
1) Increase the elevator’s surface area by making it bigger, but in exchange of more energy loss per move
2) Reduce the wing components in the centre of the wings, also help with reducing drag and increase the turning rate
3) Add a reasonable amount of propellers to assist with the maneuvering. Not too many that it becomes too heavy and spinning too fast that put the plane in a Russian roulette, and not too few that it help a little. This solution can also be adopted to simulate thrust vectoring.

creations-chat 2022-11-24 07:13:52 The platform already destined that it can’t carry much payload, nor having space for future upgrades. So far most players I’ve encountered  (not everyone I’m referring to, you know who your are the best, so don’t apply it to you if you consider it’s not applicable, in another word: don’t take the shit on you) mod the fighters with conveyor boost since the terrible turn rate destined that there would be little room for mistake (they afraid to lose). With that being said, I can do nothing but pity and wish for them to not join the Air Force… cuz they probably wouldn’t know how did they got killed in action…
creations-chat 2022-11-24 07:15:57 When family education is not being fulfilled to compensate the arrogance:
I once thought I would never bring this up again to avoid unnecessary troubles, yet I found this is necessary. I’m hereby declaring that everything I’m about to say is fact and it has not been altered by any means.

Short: they send agent to spy on your server. Why? Je he sais pas, how am I suppose to know the true motive behind?

Long: I joined the server, everything went well for the first day. Until the second day, the mod brought up a humiliation on me privately in DM for absolutely no reason. First he/she (iel) judge my age. I found that was ridiculous that the mod just assume your age and consider that assumption as a fact. Then, the mod physically told me to: “get tf out of nam nam’s server”, another example for horrible customer support, do not apply that to your occupation unless you want to be squid gamed from your job. What really rise my blood pressure was he blatantly demonstrated the screenshots he got from my server, which includes conversation between members, group’s info,… and he brag that he is going to report it to nam nam. I was back then, questioning how the hell did I let this guy slip in, plus who do they think they are that they believe they have the right to justify people like that. According to Discord’s Community guidelines, and ongoing law, an action which steal information without consent will be identified as a crime. Like who do they think they are! Overlord of Discord? A wake up call is necessary to wake those irrational ordinaries.

creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:41:24 So what's next?  Reduce the length?
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:43:30 Which component? the canopy? or the fuselage?
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:46:28 Got it
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:50:29 But the inlet was already 3 blocks wide to adapt the custom afterburner’s nozzle. Or do you mean I should increase the height of the inlet so it looks more beefy?
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:53:33 I see, ok I know where to fix.
creations-chat 2022-12-30 20:33:22 Motors keep glitching out, never happened before when I was building. How do you fix it
creations-chat 2022-12-30 20:35:51 I tested it last night and it already started behaving like this, so I can't really undo the build

general 2023-01-11 00:56:48 So, you're telling me that all the motor lock builds I have will becomes unusable in PC2
general 2023-01-11 00:57:29 should i laugh or cry now
general 2023-01-11 01:00:00 but what should you do in case two blocks are not enough to form the desired shape... That's one of the concern
general 2023-01-11 01:00:27 did he limit the amount of block you can place in one unit of space?

plane-crazy 2023-01-11 04:54:20 It’s still in progress, iv’e completed the fuselage and canopy and was about to wing it, but thank to roblox, all the motors reset themselves whenever I finished angling
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 04:55:00 Wdym by pun?
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 04:55:52 It means I’m about to make the wings

plane-crazy 2023-04-26 04:03:32 Original Soviet
Modern Russian
Polish
Slovakian
Ukrainian
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 04:04:06 I would say the Slovakian or Polish one
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 04:04:44 Certainly
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 04:06:59 Both of these are the Slovak Air Force’s MiG-29
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 04:08:11 And this is the Polish one
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:20:28 From my observation, 70-80% are omni and minis now.

-your grandson flew it
-Your great grandson will continue to fly it
Endured throughout 6 generations, real.

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:25:55 I have all the U.S. 4th gen aircrafts in my builds, but
The Tomcat is too laggy and unstable to even angle lock (thank you Rick)
The Super Hornet is my main, don’t ask why, I like the design and the block count is balanced.
The Viper is still in progress, 90%.
The Eagle, as you can see… a pain to fly
creations-chat 2023-05-09 05:27:22 New bomber?. There is

creations-chat 2023-05-09 05:31:29 The newest is the B21, that’s what we have so far. Bombers are rare these days, or perhaps you can ask someone’s granny for an old B-29 or B-17 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:35:25 My Tomcat was killed before it can even take its maiden flight, died to the hand of poor motor lock glitching out and following high ping .
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:36:33 The motors simply resetting themselves, then it just keep on glitching off its position and causes ping
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:37:16 It happens on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:38:51 Still have no idea how “client” and the game are related
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:40:14 I press F9 to check the amount of errors with the game, 5 mins into the game, 4 errors. 15 mins, 20. 30 mins, idk 50?
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:41:12 Game sometimes got frozen, forcing me to reload the page and rejoin the game.
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:44:13 Ok, iamstuck is an employee from Skunkworks from what I can tell
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:44:59 Look just like an F-35, the J35.
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:47:19 Ok, but have it started flying? The official, final model to be used for production.
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:48:32 Except that the KF-21 adopted the F-414 series (same engine series used by the Super Hornet)
creations-chat 2023-05-09 05:50:02 I would go for the B-1 or Tu-160, PC doesn’t have radar so stealth wouldn’t save you from being bullied.
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 05:51:18 J-15: Su-33 but Chinese
J-35: F-35 but Chinese

bug-reports 2023-05-18 02:41:03 Impressive coding, Rick. Watch, look at it, look and reflect on yourself. How much longer do you want the whole community to endure such miserable consequences from your tardiness? Like look, look at what your game has become. Don't you have the slightest sense of guilt witnessing all of these? Countless builds are failing because of all of these built-up errors, and have you done anything to resolve them? Does acknowledging the fact that some social tumours wreak havoc in your own game makes you feel comfortable? I suppose not. You know yourself the best, I'm hereby stating the voice of a small fragment of this community. By the very least, please give it a view, have some respect and honour your dignity. Time is running out, you either nail it on time and earn a win-win, or lose everything that you devoted your effort into.
