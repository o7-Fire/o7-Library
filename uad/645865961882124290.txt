plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:56:53 is there a way to open the door? the button just stays red
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:58:17 the one in the room with a fan at the top
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:59:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:59:47 this one
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:00:52 oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:03:22 why am I not spawning at the water, I have it set there
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:04:38 nvm I found the issue
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:21:59 what does a ballast block do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:22:19 oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 08:08:46 do you make a heli with a motor and propeller blades?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 09:28:00 I made a 2 stage rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 09:56:47 can the magnets attract to other players' things?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 10:33:03 does the water jet actually do any damage?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 12:11:46 why can't we control flaps with the mouse anymore?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 14:53:16 the entire spawn area is a war
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 04:51:17 light speed? too slow
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 04:51:44 I'm getting faster
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 04:55:19 so fast
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 04:56:59 I've hit 245k speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 04:58:00 the B.O.A.T
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 05:04:25 bo-at
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 05:39:34 shredders are the most annoying thing in the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 05:46:18 flying cutter snakes
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:02:24 
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:20:46 if you say "learn how to build" but then immediately flex tutorial crafts, you can't build
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 20:38:11 controlled surface propellers
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 10:34:37 how is there an imbalance in something made completely symmetrical?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:26:51 these children and their server laggers are so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:29:36 these kids are pathetic
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:03:06 does super strength on a magnet give it the ability to reach behind it
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:08:46 probably the speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:48:42 to what
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:04 what does turning off the powered option do? does it allow the motor to spin freely
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:51 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:56 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:11:51 is there a way to make a magnet pull/push something it's anchored to?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:12:11 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:12:58 I need this magnet to push this
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:13:28 it's a bullet for my railgun cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:13:39 I wanted to switch to something that would keep pushing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:47:48 does a helicopter need opposing propellers to fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:48:53 hecc
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:18 make it go fast
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:56 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:35 depends on the size but if you have flaps, raise them when lifting off
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:59:10 you might need those
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:03:30 you could probably do it with a single flap
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:22:11 anyone know why this keep flying backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:22:27 
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:26:48 I aligned them but it still just does flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:28:22 it flies up slowly starting to flip then stars doing more flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:32:05 done
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:32:10 still flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:33:58 it was the closest to the center of mass I could get
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:02:34 all pvp tutorial users are bad

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:21:12 oh, wrong channel
general 2020-06-30 20:21:38 almost perfect accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 21:25:36 when you weld with a magnet, does it keep break the weld when you try to push it away
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:21:43 best plane I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:21:47 
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:22:06 
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:30:01 y'all like my new mech?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:43:29 what is the weld on a magnet supposed to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:18 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:30 it doesn't work for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:57 I do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:51:12 😳
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:51:32 I can see that
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 23:10:57 maybe an HP computer like me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 23:12:16 my computer is a fat <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 23:34:30 my nuke just picked someone up and took them off the edge
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 02:18:13 I have the high ground
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 03:36:20 is there a way to see through water with the glass?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 04:03:07 christ
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 04:15:13 toxic child
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 04:15:34 
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:00 we need a limited amount of everything to get rid of the laggers
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:21 or just the ability to client side hide the base entirely
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:37 not rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:17:34 not fine at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:17:58 it takes a fraction of the rockets to lag a server
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:19:43 
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:19:59 these 4 year olds are so toxic
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:21:31 vote kick system please
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:42:18 what exactly is a servo
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 22:53:57 is power off while lock is on?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:00:11 what are the settings of the motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:34:59 do hover thrusters only raise according to the ground or can I hover off of a block
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:36:36 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:43:40 the conveyor engine?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:45:36 train?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:48:45 a piston need to push the conveyor under a block
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:48:59 there should be a 1 block space above the conveyor when the piston is closed
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:49:04 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:50:02 I'm in
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 00:09:23 Chile copied the Texas flag
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 00:10:58 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 00:11:03 glad I'm moving
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 00:11:52 what vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 00:22:14 
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 01:56:30 some child thinks material changes weight
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 01:58:19 no it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 01:59:41 
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 02:00:40 that say chyan

plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:01:31 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:01:34 not what I was expecting
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:01:51 I thought it'd be a flying Miku
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:04:43 slot 20
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:05:56 that's nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:11:24

plane-crazy 2020-07-02 03:18:28 HP is trash
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:34:22 "I use shredders and they actually take a lot of skill to use, maybe even more than a fully functional mech" 🤡
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:39:38 torsion?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:39:55 what's that
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:57:40 contest?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 08:43:32 what does damping do to the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 10:40:43 when are we getting a half horn
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 10:48:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 02:04:22 
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 02:15:40 lawn mower*
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:22:02 what's with the major interest in rockets in this game?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:22:27 I love rockets a ton but I've never seen so many other people who also love them
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:32:40 wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:33:09 wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:11 telescope works
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:29 refractor
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:34 we can't get mirrors yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:50 this is with the lowest graphics
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:40:51 it is the Roblox moon
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:08 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:18 they used a real picture of the moon
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:54 I'm getting an IRL refractor soon, I only have a reflector right now
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:44:32 rule 1 of buying a telescope, if it's not a scam, then you get what you pay for
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:44:50 don't buy from wish, they suck
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:45:08 what brand
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:45:32 bad idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:12 what do you want a telescope for
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:38 solar filter
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:45 oh, get a reflector for planets
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:47:58 how old is he
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:48:44 I could probably find a good cheap one
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:49:04 stay away from skywatcher if you have a budget
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:51:55 there is goes
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:52:12 the moon

plane-crazy 2020-07-03 06:35:25 can players in pilot seats look through your cameras?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 06:54:14 if
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:00:30 with
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:11:02 so a drone
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:18:13 what can people in the pilot seat do
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:26:47 someone actually made Starship
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:37:25 is that a vip server
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:38:52 is that a vip server
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:39:03 lemme join
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:39:12 which rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:58:26 for the designer rank, do you need to show a black count or just a screenshot of your post with the votes
general 2020-07-03 08:41:17 "women are oppressed" only women and children were allowed to survive the Titanic, shut up (the captain was also a massive simp for it)
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:14:11 
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 16:57:48 for the designer rank, do you need a screenshot of block counts or just the post with votes
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:00:30 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:04:35 I couldn't post the link the the message, is it in logs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:33:49 that 1 spot you can't place anything at is so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:53:22 why do 6 year olds think they can kill me while I'm in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:53:32 how is it not obvious when someone isn't in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 22:41:28 what is damping
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 22:59:53 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:00:12 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:04:18 show the front
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:04:39 I meant in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:05:49 use normal and triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:06:13 there's no curved out wedge corner sadly
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:34:23 example?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:36:08 1 sec
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:37:10 like this, the middle part spins while the bottom and top don't, the top needs the same stats but reversed and double the speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:37:39 np
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:23:05 what does turning on reset for motors do
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:55:24 does anyone know what the reset option in a motor does
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:58:33 > does anyone know what the reset option in a motor does
🌊
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:59:03 what does it reset
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:59:57 I don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:06 why not just keep spinning
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:24 what's a servo
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:48 oh, I've been needing that
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 02:44:35 the man behind the slaughter
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:35:14 is there a secret to making helicopters?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:42:53 does the opposing propeller have to be shorter than the lifting propeller?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:44:00 since you need opposing propellers (doesn't need it irl though) for flying, does the opposing propeller that lands it need to be shorter
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:19 everyone else says to add it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:26 I'm not using cheat blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:57 I know, that's what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:48:19 the top should be twice as fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:48:35 to counter the bottom one spinning it already
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:57:36 what hack client do you need to make a helicopter not do flips
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:13 how
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:19 why does it do flips at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:47 it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:00 in a gif?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:20 
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:55 
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:00:11 putting propellers on the bank doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:00:52 that made it worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:30 I tried that too
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:45 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:02 I  tried
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:17 it's not easy getting the density of a player
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:24 I'll make a gif
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:03:17 https://gyazo.com/83bea2e42363dba4714969ae2c23bb56
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:04:48 it doesn't matter how many blocks I take off, it only gets worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:09 I tried that too
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:17 again, what's the hack client people use
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:47 everyone who has an actual flying helicopter uses a hack client
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:02 that doesn't change anything
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:44 I've tried from 1 to 7 length
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:49 nothing changes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:08:10 "ur brand bad, bye bye"
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 05:29:45 someone needs to make a realistic goblin shark
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 05:29:51 those things are terrifying
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 07:19:14 I made the Phoenix Lights
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:07 not many people will get the reference
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:52 I've never seen the movie, only the clip
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:58 I don't even know the name of the movie
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:31:40 that's on Roblox's end
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:31:59 just a low graphics thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:39:29 where is the VIP channels
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:39:48 where are they
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:40:59 what rank do you need to be able to see it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:41:57 at least I can access #deleted-channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 10:59:40 come inside it's fun inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:05:51 someone, please make it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:06:44 yes

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 05:43:42 add blocks to the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 05:44:24 my solution is the biggest of brain ideas
general 2020-07-05 20:02:28 I looked up dystopian vehicle to see what kind of thing that was and
general 2020-07-05 20:02:29 Elon car
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:31:18 we need a setting to remove this annoying thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:32:25 because I can't see what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:33:07 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:10 pistons need a reset option
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:48 I need it to push and pull
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:58 I'd rather not spam the buttons
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:35:26 I'm trying to make a dancing parrot from minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:35:45 I need it to move in a bit of a circle
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:36:04 what's that
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:36:55 if it's this then it doesn't work the way I need it to
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:37:40 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:42:41 is it attached to the circle or is there an unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:45:13 I've been trying to do this for 3 days and nothing is working
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:50:04 I don't even know what I'm looking at

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:07:04 there's not enough time,by the time I get the gif open it's already broken
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:07:17 the random stops breaks it quickly

plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:00:35 why does my rocket tilt in different directions even at 100% perfect balance?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:04:19 the seat isn't on the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:05:47 it changes the direction of imbalance every time, I don't think it's the engines
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:08:01 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:08:46 it's in the center of the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:09:25 deleted it, not dealing with that anymore

plane-crazy 2020-09-16 11:40:28 it can now do mines
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:18:42 are shredder bugs going to be banned any time soon?
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:19:09 banning everyone who uses them
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:19:15 it's toxic
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:20:01 they move too fast and you die if tyhey touch you
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:21:23 the use in general is too toxic for a simple nerf
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:25:44 shredder bugs aren't broken, someone in my server is using them
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:26:30 I'm fine with a major asset breaking if it gets rid of these bugs
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:27:27 I have a 9x9 of explosive balls in my magnet cannon, he just respawns them over and over again
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:29:33 I'll just black list him with an auto clicker so he can still come onto my base but then he gets reset
general 2020-11-24 08:03:40 what is it called when you build it that way then have it compress to the finished vehicle
general 2020-11-24 08:04:04 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 03:00:19 for motor locking, is there an alternative for wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 03:01:31 
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 03:01:40 I'd prefer no wing panels for it
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 03:03:53 oh, I thought the panels were the reason for it shaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 03:42:25 is there a way to make motor 2 stop shaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 10:22:51 for rank requests, do I just do $new or do I add stuff with it
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 10:23:04 o
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 10:23:46 I thought it might just have a bot DM me and I put the stuff there
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:48:12 I have created my anti-sub defense
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:48:40 no, it's meant to be used as a sea mine
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:48:44 like in Nemo
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:49:04 why not
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 14:54:16 replaced rope with suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:43:27 I want to make an anchor block cannon just to anger the shredder bug users
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:44:32 you're joking right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:11:57 I sawed this boat in half
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:17:17 no, I used bombs from my sub then I used missiles
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:17:39 I wouldn't be caught dead in something as toxic as a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:35:39 I'm in that same server
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 14:23:00 you could turn that into a trap, when someone lands on it, make it swallow the plane

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 09:59:44 does anyone know why my subs are always tilting forward or backward?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:00:19 
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:00:26 I thought adding wing panels would help
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:01:14 that looks like a simple imbalance issue which is fixed by the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:02:45 but I plan on actually using a camera on it
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:03:13 I didn't say it was flipping, it's tilting
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:03:43 I made it completely even
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:04:18 the back has a single propeller but that should make the back go down not up
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:08:37 I took the propeller off but it still tilts
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:09:27 I only had 1
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:09:36 which I didn't intend to keep

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:51:17 do I really need to auto click the flip button just to keep it from tilting
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:52:07 all ballast
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:52:17 it's tilting, not flipping
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:52:42 
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:52:46 only when I drive it
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:53:02 all side have the exact same weight
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:53:44 they're in the center
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:53:59 
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:54:37 they are
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:54:54 
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:55:02 it can't, it's the ballast
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:55:26 
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:55:51 it's thinner
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:56:18 the bottom is what makes it not flip
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:57:27 these are 40 density because it didn't have enough weight to sink
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 12:58:13 there are an odd number of blocks on the vertical center
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 13:02:56 bottom removed, still tilting
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 13:06:55 10 density one a single side would make it tilt a lot more, I'd done a lot with my previous sub

general 2020-12-09 22:58:11 it was a complete success
general 2020-12-09 22:58:28 it was a tester rocket only for the hop
general 2020-12-09 22:58:44 they did have it
general 2020-12-09 22:58:48 it really wasn't a fail
general 2020-12-09 22:59:09 Scott Manly will upload on it, he'll explain it
general 2020-12-09 22:59:26 they intentionally didn't put legs on it, they knew it would blow up
general 2020-12-09 22:59:51 there were no legs
general 2020-12-09 23:00:27 can you give me a screenshot
general 2020-12-09 23:01:04 I saw no legs
general 2020-12-09 23:01:59 no legs inside
general 2020-12-09 23:03:19 it really doesn't
general 2020-12-09 23:04:01 landing maneuver
general 2020-12-09 23:05:03 it did but they were expecting that, it was on purpose
general 2020-12-09 23:08:00 just watched the finished product simulation, there were no legs
general 2020-12-09 23:08:43 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5seefpjMQJI
general 2020-12-09 23:08:52 no legs on groun impact
general 2020-12-09 23:11:54 it wasn't that fast
general 2020-12-09 23:12:04 it didn't hit the building
general 2020-12-09 23:17:54 SN9 and SN16
general 2020-12-09 23:18:23 yes, they tested a lot of stuff
general 2020-12-09 23:18:50 Elon won't be in a discord server
general 2020-12-10 00:36:53 Starship won't have 4 legs, it's 3 and they're bigger
general 2020-12-11 00:31:19 anyone else going to watch the Delta IV Heavy launch?
general 2020-12-11 02:08:14 I don't like ULA anymore
general 2020-12-11 02:10:10 I saw 1 launch from them and that was it
general 2020-12-11 02:10:50 they think they have to speak "professionally" which is really annoying
general 2020-12-11 02:11:24 NASA does it right, they talk to the camera like you're right in front of them
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:36:25 is there a way to get edge lines in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:36:44 the lighting just doesn't allow me to see edges
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:40:16 why
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:40:28 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:42:27 I paint the wedges different colors so I know what everything is but it's still hard to tell most of the time
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:40:36 7 part plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:43:44 SN8
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:52:21 landing it wasn't really even a priority
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:53:09 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:53:16 terminal velocity
general 2020-12-11 10:53:47 🤡
general 2020-12-11 10:57:10 aluminum
general 2020-12-11 10:57:43 me'al
general 2020-12-11 10:58:10 aluminium if it's bri'ish 🦷
general 2020-12-13 17:45:48 something I love doing is timing my favorite song to rocket launches
general 2020-12-13 17:47:08 the pog emotes are the funniest emotes I've ever seen
general 2020-12-13 17:47:43 
general 2020-12-13 17:49:33 I don't like how I got that one so quickly
general 2020-12-13 17:50:12 I bomb carrier from bottom
general 2020-12-13 17:51:04 anti-ship mines released directly below ship, 6 holders, 5 bombs in each, your ship go bye bye
general 2020-12-13 18:12:48 it was a good launch, I never get tired of seeing a rocket lift off
general 2020-12-13 18:13:15 (expect for ULA, I couldn't stand watching it)
general 2020-12-14 00:14:50 who is that
general 2020-12-14 00:21:56 -ping
general 2020-12-14 00:22:15 49ms gang
general 2020-12-14 00:23:16 is that as far down as it goes?
general 2020-12-14 00:25:59 -ping
general 2020-12-14 00:26:05 oh, it goes lower
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 00:28:59 Rail AA, I want to make a REAL rail cannon if the firework launchers come out again
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 00:53:48 what does taking the power from a disconnector do
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 01:14:56 why are these damn control surfaces randomly inverting
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 01:22:59 I like how PVP mode breaks everything
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:38:02 
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:39:20 what
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:39:29 oh it's you, I was hitting you, deal with it
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:39:41 I saw them hitting
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:39:48 it was on contact
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:40:23 yes i was, I saw half of your vehicle floating in 1 spot
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:40:35 I saw it
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:41:04 you know aboutt he bug where the other player is invisible but still shooting you after you hit them?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:41:25 it was hitting you
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:41:50 I hit you several times
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:41:58 yes i did
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:42:14 wrong, you were too far away, the TNT density was low
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:42:22 they get that glitch all the time
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:42:44 I constantly have to watch where the invisible vehicles are firing from
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:43:00 I had spawn protection most of the time because i was quick firing
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:43:10 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:43:20 I was shooting the half that was moving
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:43:39 because you weren't hitting me, none of your rockets came into contact
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:43:49 i don't base aim off of if it does damage
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:44:20 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:45:02 I didn't even know it was him until he started with it
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:46:33 is "jsut" anyone else's most frequent typo?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:46:38 I did
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:46:54 it doesn't matter if it does damage, that's not what getting a hit is
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:47:09 it was a magnetic TNT spread cannon, no tank
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:47:12 can't do tanks yet
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:47:19 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:47:46 honestly I don't know, I came here to make fun of someone who said using a sub is cheating and he spotted me
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:48:25 once I leave a server, I lose all interest in what ever happened
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:48:53 it's like shooting at a wire fence
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:49:03 a lot of holes so you have to hit a thin point
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:49:38 sabotage your build and let him copy that
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:50:41 "because boats can't see them"
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:50:54 they actually can if you use a filter
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:51:23 I know, someone in the server did
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:51:33 
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:52:24 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:53:38 my sub has anti-what ever the hell is above me
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:54:32 it's just TNT, I use the same key to arm, disconnect, and push with a magnet
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:54:48 the magnet can push it up high so my timing has to be perfect
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:55:22 no, the magnets are only for things above water
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:55:34 I just let the TNT go when I'm under a ship
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:55:52 it's a small sub but I can take down very large ships with it
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:56:02 I don't have torps
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:56:26 no, it's just TNT balls that I let go
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:57:08 I can raise a bit of the top of the sub to use 3 rockets in 2 different directions
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:00:13 
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:00:15 this
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:00:54 it's more of a pill
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:01:05 yes, I only fire above water
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:01:11 don't want to blow myself up
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:18 they never hit me
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:23 only 28 speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:33 it takes a while to get to ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:42 I just don't want it to be loud
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:03:39 subs can't sink
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:04:26 me
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:04:28 hecc
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:05:24 I know, I'm good at aiming missiles so if they're too fast I'll blast them
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:02:28 what is it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:44:15 2k snow blasters ain't gon happen, please bring that down to at least 25
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 02:44:31 I don't want someone trying to blow up my computer
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 03:20:52 fireworks are annoying, it has lag compensation so it shoots from way ahead in the direction you're moving
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:25:57 what does adding physics to the anchor block do
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:33:43 I think I just got it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:34:58 I figured it out
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:57:29 is there a way to make a servo act unpowered
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:58:08 why game close
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 06:00:26 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 06:02:23 I thought it would set what angle it could go to but it didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 06:28:24 I found about about hover drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 07:03:39 🕐
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 07:04:46 *unus annus* **unus annus** ***UNUS ANNUS***
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 07:05:01 I shall remember what they've done
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 09:13:15 why won't these damn fireworks shoot where I'm aiming
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 14:01:45 black hole
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 14:02:20 sadly no
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 14:02:35 the hole would be bigger but the game prefers the yellow over black
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 14:27:52 this build mode killing bug needs to end
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 03:24:36 no PVP in PVP mode guys
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 03:33:32 <@!645128367611445248> not going to give context?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 03:34:00 I thought he called me a kid which is why I said that, but I admitted to skimming over it wrong shortly after
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 03:34:17 I wasn't even watching the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:05:30 is there a way to ping pong blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:06:14 I need something to move back and forth rapidly but pistons are too slow
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:08:48 springs would work for what I'm doing if they would be retracted upon being pushed back
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:09:47 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:15:17 trying to range boost my fireworks but it's not working
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:17:09 there is a known way
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:17:16 abuse the lag compensation
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:17:43 I'm trying to boost my barrel foward as I shoot so it shoots further away
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:18:48 if I shoot while the barrel is moving backwards it shoots me from behind
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:20:53 same, I failed badly but I'm still trying to think of ways to use anything, magnets seem the most practical though
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:36:47 range boost works but it only goes as planned when firing is timed right
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:37:38 switch the keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 05:18:07 <@!645128367611445248> in case you still want to use motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 05:20:25 that'd be setting keybinds to the same thing for pushing and firing
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:03:51 why are the ropes stopping it form moving forward
the-dump 2020-12-19 07:30:36 
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:22:07 The Void Yeeter, it yeets people like this into the void
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:48:47 I love getting people with anti air sub
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:49:42 this
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:51:03 he had one
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:51:08 I was faster
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:51:46 sky mine <:PogChamp:516298810700464128>
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:15:50 tiny sub for fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:16:31 under the ice
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:16:39 there's a hole in the ice, swim down at that
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:17:46 blacklist and spam turret them
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:17:53 fight toxicity with toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 06:46:33 why don't we have an option to apply ballast tank properties at the center of mass like helium blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 06:58:26 what's the player + seat density
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 07:02:32 if Thanos tries to balance my sub on his finger, it'd fall off
general 2021-08-27 02:34:57 will PC2 have... **MORE WEDGES?**
general 2021-08-27 02:35:55 #wedge-lore
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 07:44:57 can these things be banned for server lagging?
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 07:45:33 (btw, I fully condone mass harassment towards trash)
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:01:32 is there a way to let someone else control my creation?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:03:18 how would that mean I know a lot about the game?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:04:00 https://tenor.com/view/dumb-patrick-star-spongebob-gif-18338460
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:04:04 me ^^
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:04:30 I did put 2 arrows
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:39:28 if I report some trash for intentionally causing lag, will it get banned?
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:41:06 damn
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:44:12 just have to spam their username, I forgot to download an auto clicker to this computer, this seems like a good time
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:45:19 alt F4 stills asks me to use the app before closing (what?), trying to rejoin will only put me in the same server because roblox doesn't understand that I don't want to be in that server even after leaving it several times
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:47:53 it did crash itself in the first attempt
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 21:50:12 spent 1.7k to build a PC but I won't spend 60 on a game
general 2022-10-10 01:39:30 is anyone here really good with computers?
general 2023-06-16 21:43:31 does anyone have any monitor arm recommendations? it needs to be compatible with 100 and 75, the monitors will be 24.4 and 11.7 width weighing 7.72 lb/3.5 kg and the other is probably lighter
general 2023-06-16 21:44:28 they were so proud of the fish they didn't catch
general 2023-06-16 21:46:54 this sounds like someone who's always trying to start drama
general 2023-06-16 21:47:20 basically 10whitesocks from the JB server
