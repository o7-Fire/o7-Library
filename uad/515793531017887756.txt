general 2020-07-05 12:37:41 I saw a FRANXX at plane crazy
general 2020-07-05 12:37:51 **Shredder Bugs are no match**
general 2020-07-05 12:38:07 Nah
general 2020-07-05 12:38:11 That’s impossible
general 2020-07-05 12:38:28 Nothing can escape the void
general 2020-07-05 12:38:40 Once your at the void
general 2020-07-05 12:38:43 You can’t get back
general 2020-07-05 12:39:02 btw I made a remote control missile against Shredder Bug users
general 2020-07-05 12:40:40 Code V “Paladin”
general 2020-07-05 12:40:42 Hmmmm

general 2020-07-05 12:41:45 Code VI will be another Water Vehicle
general 2020-07-05 12:42:19 Then Code VII Emperor
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:43:02 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:43:09 maybe that’s your problem
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:43:23 That’s why
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:43:32 Folded Planes are hard to control
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:44:12 I’m a noob pilot
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:44:20 I can’t fire guns correctly
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:44:37 and my rockets can’t hit
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:44:54 how do you even make shredder bugs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:45:18 The tutorial only showing is the same plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:45:29 The starter plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:46:24 the best motor turret keybind is the arrows
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 12:46:40 not the motor 2
general 2020-07-05 12:47:38 I might use my VR set for controlling the mech
general 2020-07-05 12:47:40 nvm
general 2020-07-05 12:47:59 I think VR on Plane Crazy ain’t available
general 2020-07-05 12:50:17 Vengeance Series is a series of machines created to cause chaos in servers and every vehicle are tasked on different types of war machines by other rivals,Every Vengeance creation takes 1-5 hours to ensure its best state.
general 2020-07-05 12:50:49 Then Code VII will be easy drive
general 2020-07-05 12:51:04 I hope motor 2 supports the VR hands

general 2020-07-07 04:28:07 The goal of stealth technology is to make an airplane invisible to radar. There are two different ways to create invisibility: The airplane can be shaped so that any radar signals it reflects are reflected away from the radar equipment. The airplane can be covered in materials that absorb radar signals.

general 2020-07-08 09:54:34 Melting ice triggered by global warming may make Earth whirl faster than before and could shift the axis on which the planet spins, researchers say. This could also affect sunset times, as the length of Earth's day depends on the speed at which the planet rotates on its axis
