general 2021-12-18 20:14:44 That's so pro
general 2021-12-18 20:15:38 I mean that build is single handingly better than most ships I see in public servers
general 2021-12-18 20:16:09 Yes
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:27:38 No
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:36:22 I mean, I agree, I'd rather see the progress and know what to expect than have very little knowledge. Also if something rickje is making and people don't like it he could know before it releases
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:41:00 If his friend took the pictures the lines wouldn't be blue because it's his friends screen, that should be easy to see

creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:26:20 <@792070674465423360> that's not gonna get any better than the plane
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:31:31 First of all gunner on top is spammed with all 10 guns, the turret is a big box with four fireworks on the end, the hull is garbage with rockets on sides with no detail at all
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:36:31 That logic doesn't make sense though, if everything had smooth sides nothing would be cool to look at, at that point make a circle and call it a day
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:38:57 You built the most basic looking tank ever also, it's got nothing
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:41:24 You said rate it, what do you expect plus many people had that logic before you , affectivness smh
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:44:17 My first tank was a year ago, don't got a pic

creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:51:06 It doesn't take that long to look at an image lol, your in the wrong place if you canT take a heaping spoonful of criticism,
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:53:36 You don't need to use motor locking though, I try to use a small amount, for my airship I only used motorlock for the turrets
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:58:21 Your in the wrong place then, make the build look good while being op
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:01:10 Lmao if you think your plane looks perfect your not getting anywhere
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:10:02 Jesus how long can this go for, it's rinse and repeat at this point
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:12:04 Lmao your just as bad as the shredder, you spammed every gun onto the turret and added 6 rockets and lava sprayers on the side
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:33:51 Are you guys still going <@792070674465423360> you said that half an hour ago, what happened

creations-chat 2021-12-27 23:53:59 That shouldn't take 2.3 hours to do, it's a brick with some peepholes and a two block turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:21:32 I hope you aren't serious
creations-chat 2021-12-28 14:11:06 Y'know the Titanic doesn't have wide windows across the hull right

events-chat 2022-02-21 23:25:23 its a zeppelin event
events-chat 2022-02-21 23:26:26 airship in general i imagine
events-chat 2022-02-22 00:00:12 so far i got this, guns on the red for my gunship
events-chat 2022-02-22 00:00:31 balloon in the center maybe or on top
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:29:08 dying
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:29:56 its a gunship, cant add bombs to it anyway
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:31:34 it says only to use 8 guns
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:31:50 plus there is a role for that, torpedo bomber
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:33:51 did you read the rules
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:34:38 destroyer is the only one that can use 3 rockets
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:35:19 honestly the destroyer is gonna be op, rockets are the #1 thing that kills my past zeppelins
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:37:24 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:37:56 ok now i see some of the downfalls for a destroyer
events-chat 2022-02-22 23:09:27 my zeppelin flies more like a plane than a zeppelin
events-chat 2022-02-22 23:09:44 it can do flips <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-22 23:19:41 aight mines about done except paint obviously
events-chat 2022-02-23 00:55:53 So we can't have out build if it despawned goes outside the limits even if its motorlock?
events-chat 2022-02-23 00:57:32 My build despawned is bigger than the build limit, with motorlock, when spawned in it is in build limit
events-chat 2022-02-23 00:58:08 Wha
events-chat 2022-02-23 00:58:34 WHAT
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:18:18 K glad, all I used motor lock for was for an angle in my "wings" and for better looking tail
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:18:38 And it went out of build limit by 5-10blocks
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:58:45 why do you have 9k pings
events-chat 2022-02-23 03:36:20 Custom props for this event are a bit obsolete, they take multiple blocks of space and are a fat target for rockets, although they can grant more speed and reverse

events-chat 2022-04-21 11:59:00 For me atleast
creations-chat 2022-04-23 02:15:19 Disturbing
events-chat 2022-04-24 15:58:52 due to the limitation of the blocks you could actually use to detail and make it look like a sub, im guessing it was harder to make a conventional sub, id go for box plus imo it looked kinda cool
events-chat 2022-04-24 19:37:41 Yeah I forgot about motorlock, agreed
events-chat 2022-04-26 01:41:22 So we just forgetting about airship event <:m_:778994206948589638>

creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:05:14 <@453015366281723905>  back then people didn't see steam as a super reliable option for transport, this ships like this still has the option of sail
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 02:17:22 How did this past event go down<:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 02:17:31 No chicken butts for me
creations-chat 2022-05-15 14:58:17 I'd redo the tail, and what elite said, the wing design is too boxy for what it is
creations-chat 2022-05-15 21:37:46 <@733428747398545449> it looks like you tried to blend a modern Russian battle cruiser with a Uss Iowa

creations-chat 2022-05-22 23:57:35 Which. One.
general 2022-05-22 23:59:00 
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:00:45 Well you got some useless motorlock, exposed motorlock on tail which is horrendous, and wing design is a cheese grater
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:09:01 My man that's like 20-60 blocks, no way that took more than an hour of time, the most time taking part of the entire build was probably the already useless motorlock on the tail
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:11:20 There isn't a lot to constructively criticize, it's basic on the outside, useless motorlock which is also exposed on the tail, wing design doesn't blend a whole lot, and it just looks pretty much effortless
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:15:18 Yes make custom if you want, is it based around anything? If not, the cockpit doesn't blend at all with the fuselage making it look like a hunchback


Oh wait the black just blended with the baseplate
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:20:08 F16 really said
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:46:27 That is a absurd amount of motorlock for two cylinders to be place halfway inside a block, also half cylinders exist   <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>

I'm still thinking your unde

creations-chat 2022-05-27 14:11:25 Can't believe this started from a argument about the grammatic meaning of LEGO ©️
creations-chat 2022-05-27 14:13:39 Honestly wouldn't be surprised if they made an alt
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:12:07 Detail
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:15:07 Also your wrong about the length, this is one long loco, anyway image speaks for otself
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:18:00 It's still short, even with the top block gone, the red line is too thick with the paint being a bit messy, there is like zero detail in the wheels of the train, along with upper vents being wrong entirely with lacking stuff on the top
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:20:02 I copied and pasted the exact loco name you mentioned, it is the same
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:22:33 Most of the stuff still applies, the length, the paint, the attention to detail on the wheels and the rest of the train
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:25:38 No it's the wrong locomotive, the number on the side gives that away, but the same company and paint
creations-chat 2022-05-27 22:26:43 <@456226577798135808> exactly how much effort did you put into either of those?

creations-chat 2022-06-15 22:18:31 The only thing I don't like about the build is the superstructure and the Ludicrous sized funnel, they feel too far apart from one another and the funnel feels almost too large other than that it's good 👍
creations-chat 2022-06-15 22:26:34 Ah I see, still somewhat applies as far as the distance between the funnel and the superstrucutre
creations-chat 2022-06-17 20:26:24 <@645834473115484188> just because it's a pvp build doesn't mean it needs 5 minutes of effort and God awful looks

creations-chat 2022-06-18 19:37:52 <@727433816217616509> the entirety of the interior could use some work with detailing and realism. The hull looks very bland and uses very basic shapes for the bow and Stern. The superstrucutre could be more detailed.

creations-chat 2022-07-09 19:52:32 That's not the only thing you were lazy on
creations-chat 2022-07-09 19:56:13 Make some weathering
creations-chat 2022-07-09 19:58:30 Maybe around the water line and the whole deck, kinda like this very old picture of a discontinued carrier I was making (doesn't have to be so light)
creations-chat 2022-07-09 20:36:39 Make it a bit more contrast between colors
creations-chat 2022-07-10 17:03:15 <:actsFlosh:818819210049355818>
creations-chat 2022-07-10 21:26:25 <@984300044297592854> complete the build before you post it in creations

Read the rules, will ya
creations-chat 2022-07-11 15:56:23 Square
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:54:36 That's pcc for ya
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:01:53 I'm laughing so hard right now because get it? Your dad went to get the milk because of the empty plot meaning he's gone? 😐
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:13:22 No, just it's overused at this point and really unfunny
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:16:08 
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:18:09 Damn you just now realized that? Not the whole crazy good angle locking and hull along with the pixelated lines on the deck?
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:20:11 Didn't see that, sorry
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:22:46 Maybe hacked and implemented it in
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:24:47 That doesn't make any sense, much easier to just exploit and implement a model in
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:26:48 You'd be surprised man, Roblox safegaurds are terrible
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:30:24 I don't see how you don't think you can just exploit models into games, plus I don't even think it's physically possible to make a build from a game into studio
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:32:48 Sus!!!1!1!1!1!1
creations-chat 2022-07-13 16:56:18 Creations keep hitting an all time low

creations-chat 2022-07-18 22:32:17 The hull isn't the only problem, the superstructure doesn't look anything like the real thing, hell the rest of the destroyer

creations-chat 2022-07-25 18:28:30 Good, hull looks a bit cancer, instead of a block width of space in-between each layer, I'd do a half block just to make it look a bit smoother

creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:51:50 Yeah, add slight weathering maybe
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:03:51 Lighter in the middle and darker on the outside

creations-chat 2022-08-12 22:02:57 Way too saturated, the blue is an eyesore to look at

creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:17:49 Atleast a tad bit of detail could make the thing look better than it is, it just looks so basic and becomes an eyesore to look at
creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:22:16 Use this for some detail inspiration why don't ya

creations-chat 2022-09-18 01:30:28 More detail for the rocks and lava would work fine, as long as you make them look good
creations-chat 2022-09-18 01:33:15 Waves, perhaps? Or some weathering in some way, just to make it look less flat and basic
creations-chat 2022-09-18 13:08:57 Finally another mortal engines build
