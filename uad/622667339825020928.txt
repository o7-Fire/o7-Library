plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:22:36 and how exactly do you lock on
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:23:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:28:04 you dont
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:30:46 and thats where you are wrong
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:34:20 with a harpoon that you can just put tnt on
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:36:34 just put tnt on the harpoon though
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:39:29 how do you manage to get the harpoon on the target anyways
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:44:50 <@!454809803223465984>  so you are saying that you have a harpoon that you somehow manage to stick in a target and a computer that somehow manages calculates the speed and distance of the harpoon and turrets that somehow manage to take the information from the computer
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:50:10 also does this computer calculate for drop?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:51:06 and how does it do that
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:51:45 well how do you get the harpoon in the target initially
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:52:35 no answer i see
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:53:16 but how do you get the harpoon to the enemy vessel
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 19:59:02 your stupidity is contagious
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:08:12 yeah but you still havent told me how you get the harpoon to the target for the glitching
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:09:29 if you have to ram the target that is a terrible locking system and you might as well make a kamikaze ship
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:13:43 yeah there is no way to get distance
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:15:55 you literally said you can only lock on to one target though

plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:20:55 how difficult is it to lock on to a target with the harpoon though

plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:52:26 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 20:59:20 how distance though
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 21:00:23 so you just look at how far away they are and it just works?
