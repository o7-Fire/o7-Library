creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:50:48 <@877106868491792424> that's cool bro...but who asked
also, why did you even decide to make that? first of all, nobody cares. second, it was poorly made
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:52:51 and that's ok, but I'm just wondering why you felt the need to post it here
I'm not trying to be anti-whatever, but I'm just curious
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:55:50 it's made for what, you to victimize yourself because it's possibly one of the least creative things posted here besides shredder bugs?
like people said before, it's just some writing on the floor. no color, no nothing
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:58:31 also, I'd hate to minimod, but there's a rule against religious and controversial stuff lol
general 2023-04-14 12:59:58 on god
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:01:00 if you think people calling your basic writing "low effort" is discrimination, you need to rethink how you interact with ppl online

creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:02:39 oh no was it the washsticker?
creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:22:03 that would mean that 1 stud equals 1 foot
creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:24:47 a roblox character would be about 5 studs tall, and if 1 stud equals 1 foot, 1 block in plane crazy is 2.5 cubic feet
creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:28:01 I was going by how you said that kph is equal to sps, and 1 kph is roughly 1 f/s
