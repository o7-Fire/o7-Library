bug-reports 2022-01-05 23:10:04 the speed goes off the bar
bug-reports 2022-01-05 23:23:07 ik but its stupid af when the game is like " you know what, your moter locking is cringe" and yeets you into the void faster then the speed of light
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 23:46:20 so a single unit of speed is mesured in blocks per second and i enstimate a block is about a meter so useing those numbers, i whent about 2500 times times the speed of light
bug-reports 2022-01-05 23:48:46 16 id rather use "old words" that everybody knows then something that is new or boring
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 23:50:27 add more wing pannles

general 2022-05-25 11:35:29 Aw wtf Washington post
general 2022-05-25 11:36:09 Average discord mod
general 2022-05-25 18:07:51 Gamer moment, average fornite
general 2022-05-25 18:08:18 Why?
general 2022-05-25 18:08:29 It's talking about the creations
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:09:50 It should be alot less since this is a chat talking about creations, not the actual creations channel 

It's stupid af to limit the speed of chat in thus chat when it's about helping people
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:13:43 Well maybe if the mods Would stop  arguments instead of punishing everyone for the actions of the few, this chat can be a chat not just a place for arguments over builds

And arguments mean arguments not just debates 
I needed to clarify that cause some people are stupid af
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:18:49 Well if for instance; I would be asking about recommendations for a build, I would ask in here
When a 6 hour slow mode would be active the people won't be able to respond
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:24:22 The problem with that is that it would have to not be about negitive feedbacks cause then it will be (I can't find a better way to say this) a circle j**k
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:28:50 At least ur honest causes some of the mods treat it as a job
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:31:30 I'm in multiple servers that if it gets leaked that it would start an investigation by the fbi, due to the ironic shitposting
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:34:58 I vote for anarchy
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:37:03 Also bois
We are all considered domestic terrorists according to the Washington post

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 15:59:24 Mig 29> tomcat
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:00:12 Well the rafal was made and produced way after the mig 29 and the tomcat
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:00:31 The mig 29 and tomcat were made in the mid 70s
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:01:15 Ew stealth, i prefer hyper sonic jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:03:12 Ew Norma jets, only the vj 101 is good

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:17:49 My first vehicle was a helicopter appart form the tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 14:32:27 U can also just use machenical ball joints
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 14:32:54 They are very usfull in a helicopter squashplate wich has a ball joint irl

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:50:20 it functions like im in space
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:50:31 ima do some speed tests
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:52:05 why are my hover engines broken?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:50 i may have made the fastest controled vehicle in the game
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:32:09 wait can i get inventor role for making what i can presume to be the first frictionless vehicle that is controlled even at high speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:40:57 fastest controlled vehicle in game (i didn't go faster cause the vid would be bad, but it has no friction, meaning no speed cap)
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:43:28 <@217336009455566848> can i get inventor for this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:43:59 ikr funni ping

plane-crazy 2022-06-19 22:38:32 i would use angle locking but i understand that that is very adcanced stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 22:38:57 for the front to make it more accurate angle
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 22:40:02 that looks like a 30 degree angle
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 22:40:47 ima eat ill be back to show <@456226577798135808> my "artificial friction"
general 2022-06-20 00:10:25 Give me 2 min
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:14:03 my god this heli looks insane with glass
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:16:01 its not for the "trend" im showing the amout of moterlock
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:20:11 any sugestions?
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:38:27 
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:40:36 almost 1.1k, still ridiculous the amount of parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:42:42 no lol its angle locking and the coplexity of my flight controll system which u can see here https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/987499625097355345
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:45:31 its inside the heli, of corse u cant see it
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:48:23 its not smh, i can show u more in depth
its not the system its self that has lots of blocks, its the part where i canot touch the moving parts with the heli or else the thing breaks
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:50:26 yeah no crap, i used lots of blocks incaseing the system, without touching it, meaning i used lots of small parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:52:31 plus the moterlocking and the angle locking and the small details yes 1.1k is reasonable

bruh u stupid, u dont get that i used lots of round parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:54:34 see how its smooth? that causes lots of blocks cause there are not cylinder beams
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/987911189621260318/988592863422062602/unknown.png
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:57:50 That's without seeing the back side
creations-chat 2022-06-21 00:00:18 Plus why are you trying to prove that my 1.1k block build isn't 1.1k blocks
Why would I lie about that, I wouldn't spend extra time just to place more blocks than I need

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:22:12 public servers be like
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:41:59 kinda but it has no real control surfises since it uses thrusters to turn, its super toxic but easy to kill since that guy is bad at the game
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:06:49 i mean semi realistic by how it flys, its not propeled like a plane nor is it super fast and it also flys from the tilt of the entire heli
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:09:23 its semi because realistic controls dont work on a small scale
but the controls work realistically
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:11:24 the squashplate controls the pitch and roll, its how it helis irl move, im using the same controls to fly

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 02:16:41 V8 engine with a working clutch, transmission, and brake
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 02:21:28 ima put this in creations
creations-chat 2022-07-26 02:33:28 idk its an 8 cylinder
its essential a v8
creations-chat 2022-07-26 02:36:58 the problem with that is that the hover engine will try to push the engine down so you have to counter act that with a piston going in the opposite direction synced with the first one, or else it would either not move or fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 03:23:20 Make plane more  stable in both axises, lower moter speed, and/or lower torque

creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:34:56 this is the trasmission, there is no gears in plane crazy it it relies on the angle of the 90 degree turn for "gears"
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:36:58 bro i dare u to try to make a gear in plane crazy, my thing has 2 "gears" forward and reverse, so techicaly a transmission
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:39:37 irl you use a gear to move the rotational force perpendicularly, in plane crazy you cant do that so i used a moveable 45 degree angle to change movment direction
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:41:45 also friction dosnt have enough torque in plane crazy now shut
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:43:47 it isnt a transmission but functions as one, its not possible to make a transmission with out gears, so whats your point?
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:45:53 THANK YOU, its not possible to make accurate so i have to re-invent the reverse "gear"

<@588596347272167456> literly shut up, you are now trying to prove your failing point by hypothisising somting that i already did in a simple manor

general 2022-08-06 00:42:18 Honestly
general 2022-08-06 00:43:38 A tactical nuke is noting compared to icbms cause tactical nukes can only be in the kilo tons cause the troops need to exploit the break in the lines formed by the nukes
general 2022-08-06 00:44:44 An air burst doesn't produce much fallout
general 2022-08-06 00:45:24 That's not too radioactive
general 2022-08-06 00:47:08 Yes its not like fallout 4
general 2022-08-06 00:47:53 An airburst blasts most of the radiation into space, it's bearly radioactive after
general 2022-08-06 00:49:07 A nuke is surprisingly hard to explode, u know atoms usually don't like to split

creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:10:23 Honestly
creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:12:47 Also why not just use 2 buttons for locking

Because there's a small issue, the game doesn't have equal and opposite reactions so a v8 will function like a hover drive and fly up
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:34:22 Now that u mention it, I rewached the vid and see that u have 2 power strokes, counter acting the hover engine
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:36:32 I might but tbh u and I and a few others are some of the only people with fully functional engines, so I just want to see how u did it, so I can improve mine
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:40:37 Sure ig but I already know much about how to build engines but we can learn from eachother maybe
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:43:29 Ima keep in touch with you cause I'm trying to upgrade my mechanical car
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 03:25:51 i have to make multi stage clutch pads for my automatic transmission that dont require multiple buttons <:nooo:787097964946259978>

creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:26:50 <@842760720125788172> people are downvoting because first of all: that's not 2 cylinders
secondly: ugly 
third: that's not any type of engine for instance a v8 or a boxer
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:46:02 The top since it probably have multiple strokes

The probably is emphasized
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:55:49 make it work then

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:05:22 lmao thats an ugly bow in the thumbnail 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:05:36 why is it so strait
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:13:38 it has a slight slant
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:13:40 irl
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:20:15 my new "thing" i made
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:22:45 yes and no, going 69k speed makes u pass the map faster then it renders
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:23:04 but i can hypeteticaly turn
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:23:57 well turning isnt very ussful when ur over the void
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:24:14 and it goes so fast that its practicaly imposable to find the map again
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:29:43 is that controlable 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:29:51 like can u turn it
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:30:08 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 20:31:04 exactly, the whole point of my build to to be as fast as posible while still being able to be fully controled on all axises
creations-chat 2022-09-12 20:41:29 tbh its super simple u need one for yaw and one for pitch
creations-chat 2022-09-12 20:44:43 its a frictionless control, it uses hover thrusters to form a differential in the opposite direction of where u point it, causing the whole thing to turn without the use of wing pannles and is mouse controlled

basically the spring part induces some dampening, the hover thrusters make it turn, the  2 is inverted, and the "walls" provide something for the hover thrusters to detect
creations-chat 2022-09-13 13:46:20 U can beatly even see the build and its not even good
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:10:34 UHHHH
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:10:48 i may have found a way to go ALOT faster in rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:16:46 rocket engiens have a linear cap
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:19:17 lol normaly yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:19:50 but i have zero drag
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:19:56 and using gltich
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:23:03 YOOOO i managed to get to 4800 speed with rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 01:23:30 but it hit the null zone and my thing started to wobble and coundent further accelerate
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 02:24:43 Kinda, rockets in plane crazy have max linear speed due to drag, but the drag doesn't account when slightly horizontal, so more horizontal the less drag/ more speed,
But more u angle the less torque
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 16:34:31 Camera lock the wings in

general 2022-09-28 18:15:37 Yes all the dedicated builders including me and all the people in the pvp leage have either quit or isn't playing the game much
general 2022-09-28 18:18:56 Well it's kinda boring to build ultra complex builds to either be fucked by shredders or spend 16-20 hours on somting just to use it twice

help 2022-11-07 15:11:16 But I still know how it works
help 2022-11-07 15:12:47 Basicly u have to sync the pushing or compressing force with the position of the piston
help 2022-11-07 15:34:55 Btw the people on YouTube tend to have inefficient, or un tuned (hover thruster flings car)

plane-crazy 2022-12-29 01:48:55 wrong chat, oh whatever
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 21:33:47 gyro scopes dont work in this game smh
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 21:37:29 i was making a heli with gyro stabilization for a heli but i realized that gyroscopic effects dont exist in this game smh
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 21:45:06 no thats easy, see how my heli pitches and rolls very hard and isnt smooth, a using a stabilizer bar ( a fly bar) would dampen the control input
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 21:46:26 it would also keep it perfectly upright and wont allow tittering unless commanded
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 21:48:20 no, basically,  since gyroscopic effects dont exist, i cant use a stabilizer bar
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 22:12:50 the problem is that big builds arnt always good builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 22:21:02 or to be complex, like mine lol

general 2023-01-12 12:35:34 Idk I'm pretty sure I have the bigest possible ball in plane crazy 51 blocks in diameter
creations-chat 2023-01-12 15:29:07 A 51 block perfect circle without moterlock?
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 02:35:20 minigun high speed feed system
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 03:32:42 It's the feed system 💀, plz read
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 03:36:11 The point of the feed system is to put as much ammo into separate barles as fast ad possible, every ball is pushed by the "fireing pin" into separate barrels
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 03:36:45 It's more like a bolt but still,
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 03:37:09 So of I add Barrels it would need accurate and fast
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:15:36 its either high rpm with weird phaseing glitches or low rpm
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:18:29 it has an autoloader, it can load like 10 "bullets" per second
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:28:45 the auto loader pushes the "bullets" infront of a "bolt" that pushes the "bullet" into an individual barrel, beyond a point where it can interact with a magnet pushing it out

basicly, you see the back-middle part with springs, the point of that is to basically make a tilted cam groove that pushes the balls with pistons forward at a certain point, engaging the magnets (firing)

general 2023-01-27 23:14:36 hmm what should i make next (mechanically complex)

creations-chat 2023-02-13 03:10:12 Yeah only boxer engines work, cause u need to have a counter push to counteract the opisite force of the hover thruster

As u see from this, I have a piston extending from both sides going in opisite directions at the same to to counteract the force of a hover thruster
creations-chat 2023-02-15 14:09:55 There are 500+ trails and idk what ones are on or off
