plane-crazy 2022-09-06 19:00:51 what is a shedder
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 19:01:20 Shredder bugs are small, missile-like crafts that are typically used by small Pathetic children that travels at normal Plane Crazy speeds (200-400 studs per second) and shred builds with multiple spinning cutters. Most tutorial players have them. They are extremely powerful?
