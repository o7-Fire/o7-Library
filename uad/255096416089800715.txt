bot-central 2021-08-27 03:32:42 unfortunate
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:33:40 I built a rocket with 883 parts in the span of like 2 hours unfortunate day
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:34:16 HOW IS THAT
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:34:40 how is that a pOINT
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:35:10 unfair......
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:35:49 I wanna build   rockets to spac
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:36:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:37:34 I don't know if my rocket actually flies without helium blocks i just tested the staging with them
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:40:23 true!!!
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:40:30 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:40:33 i have NO idea !

plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:42:09 cobblestone has like some weird cement thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:47:41 is this eternal ranting
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:48:06 i did a really cool recreation of an atlas-mercury rocket but it is unflyable without helium :(

general 2021-08-27 03:51:41 minesweeper free
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:52:02 how do i make rocket not go booooom sideways
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:52:27 Oh yeah i could use control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:53:15 No it just tips over at some point
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:54:04 borin
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:55:11 I would if it wasnt the biggset pain in the ass to put things inside my fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:55:16 i know
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:55:55 Yeah but
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:55:57 i still gotta
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:56:00 put it inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:56:15 Baloon tanks were the cheaty method
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:56:21 baloon tanks LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:56:23 wrong game
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:56:27 helium blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:58:06 I don't really like tanks and stuff the only direction i care about is up
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:58:20 L
bot-central 2021-08-27 03:58:32 there's no level up messages or anything? huh
bot-central 2021-08-27 03:58:39 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:02:04 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:02:20 Actually i think i made a X-1 as my first craft in game
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:02:37 it went really fast and actually lifted off
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:02:44 unfortunately no air launch
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:04:16 is there a way to make a compact gyroscope because the way i am formulating it in my head makes it way too wide to fit inside here
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:04:39 the inside cavity is 5x5
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:05:32 okay that didn't help at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:18:05 ok s
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:20:49 fuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:21:00 my rocket is too small to fit a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:21:08 but like
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:21:11 just by a TINY bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:33:41 I spent like a solid good "too much time" trying to make a gyro work
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:47:34 Damn lol my first rocket I've ever built would technically qualify me to a rocket scientist III rank but it unfortunately has helium because the structure itself is kinda bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:47:57 Yeah but I cant
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:48:03 Because that would violate other rules
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:48:21 It pitches downwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:48:42 The structure doesn't allow it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:48:51 I have to build a wholeass new rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:49:31 Unfortunate because I thought it looked really cool :sadsphere:
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:50:04 No I remove helium but I am physically unable to make it work with any kind of stablization
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:50:12 For some reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:50:24 I can try new stuff tomorrow but link me ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:50:36 Because the rocket itself is SICK
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:50:41 The looks I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:51:05 Wait lemme send a pic of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:51:43 Like
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:51:54 I still haven't finished the wedges and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:52:00 But so far it looks really cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:52:44 I have fuel inside for no reason actually need to remove it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:53:05 Forgot about the fuel blocks I put before I actually clicked the settings button
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:54:27 Alr if you can send me something I could do to stabilize it without helium I'd remove the launch tower and I would be very happy with my time spent
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:56:16 Hey atleast I know how to make voxel circles
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:56:43 If I added wedges to this bad boy I'd easily hit 800 parts just by the rocket itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:57:35 Is that part of the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:57:45 That's so the whole thing doesn't fall lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 04:58:40 Nah I just prefer attaching stuff that is already attached to anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:00:41 Also here's a fun little attempt to time my parachutes
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:01:06 Also that "abort system" tower that can't be a tower got stuck somehow
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:01:40 Size limit ðŸŸ¡
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:02:37 I gotta remove very unnecessary weight I put like ages ago first
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:02:56 When I first made the side boosters I put fuel tanks inside and it sucks to remove them
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:03:32 I prefer finishing this one first by now
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:05:34 Btw you still haven't suggested ideas so far
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:06:10 I can't really do anything very complex but just by my basics physics understanding the gyroscope I tried to do was too big for the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:07:44 I just want to look at how make rocket go  stable in an under 5x5 area
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:07:50 I have no.   Idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:08:19 Well that's why I'm asking
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:08:36 If it is so easy why can't anybody tell me ðŸŸ¡
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:11:48 Yes I know how real rockets work
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:12:02 But the wings in this game just don't work at all for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:12:10 Compared to what I expect
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:12:39 Btw I put wings on it and they didn't really help at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 05:25:04 This looks like those old 2011 tycoon games where you had a massive box that dropped cubes into money
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:51:12 You managed to revert the speed of the planets lmao the outer planets go slower not faster
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:51:49 Oh yeah about parachutes
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:52:05 How big does a parachute need to not die at a 6000 speed fall
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:53:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:53:25 Ouch
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:53:33 That was at least 100gs
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:56:15 Do you think this build looks nice (not very functional but visually)
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:56:41 Because this is the first thing I built in the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:56:48 I wanted to go higher but height limit
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:59:16 Why do all tutorials on youtube of advanced mechanics in this game sucks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 13:59:22 They help nothing at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:00:11 What
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:00:38 The purpose of a tutorial is to teach my guy, if they don't teach you by the end of the day they failed as tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:00:50 I am not using those so far on my builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:01:14 ?????
"You wanna learn something but nobody bothers enough to teach you so just don't learn it lmao"
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:02:26 Yeah problem is the thing I build is not a normal type of build looking into creations
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:03:49 Wym refernce pictures my man I am talking about mechanical structures
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:04:12 How
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:04:24 I'm trying to make a functional structure not an actual thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:04:50 And if I did that to the thing I want to build it doesn't fit inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:05:07 If you're wondering
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:06:04 What if I build things I want?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:06:12 A rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:06:43 Yeah holy shit but I need to know how some stuff works but everything in youbute is scuffed to the point I couldn't understand the mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:07:12 I have the shape ready, any reference pic would not fit inside, and I just want to stabilize it midair
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:07:34 Yeah that's true but it isn't very yawable if you get me
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:13 It symetrical but the 2nd stage goes bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:21 I added wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:37 If I wanted to use a real life mechanic inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:46 If I used a picture for the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:49 Its too big using blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:52 Get stuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:08:58 DUDE
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:09:08 I am trying to use a mechanic to stabilize it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:09:35 It's too big using the blocks is what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:09:43 It gets stuck to the walls unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:03 Yeah but I just want to look into a smaller version
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:07 And that's the problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:14 No one shows any smaller versions
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:25 Late
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:43 Are you sure? Saw someone mention about how they made it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:46 But never showed it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:11:37 Yeah dude I'm looking for that because I personally want to make this work
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:12:01 Or I'm just using helium blocks at the end not even caring
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:13:09 I am literally a starter player I know not a single thing about this
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:13:45 The other guy who's failing to troll
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:13:52 I kinda fell to the bait but don't care
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:14:20 How to stabilize this rocket and add pitch and yaw control
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:14:57 I know how engines can be gimballed using mortors you don't need to say it again I just want to stabilize it after
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:15:19 Well? I have to do it like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:15:40 According to the rules I have to stabilize it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:16:15 I have some small winglets
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:16:29 I am based on an atlas-mercury rocket if you want to look at it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:36:52 Found a video with like 47 views teaching me exactly what I wanted
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:39:43 Upvote for downvote farming
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:41:14 Btw how exactly did you make that nose spike thing? I was looking for doing that for my X-1 rocketplane
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:41:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:42:13 Oh I was aware of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:42:26 But do you just do it with one?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:42:31 What part is it I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:42:53 Is it the trail thing?
general 2021-08-27 15:46:33 Boomers are elders by now what do you mean
general 2021-08-27 15:54:59 I like how scuffed the early days of aviation were
it developed so quickly in the military that they to name stuff they just put aero behind nautical which makes like no sense but i guess air is just a big fluid we live in
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:55:43 TRUE
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:58:56 I mean what does it change there's 10 downvotes already
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 15:59:12 i was gonna upvote already just because someone wasted their time on a weekday :))
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:04:47 Free way of getting downvotes: change the color of the build and repost it again next day
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:05:41 i don't care about what it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:07:12 catgirls are actually disgusting when you think about them
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:08:06 What ears do they have? Are they cat sized or human sized? Do their claws retract? are they entirely furry? and most importantly how can you not be sure sentient catgirls won't go on a catgirl rights movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:27:00 I'm trying to just formulate a gimbal idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:27:47 Can't you just remove rule2 by rule3
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:28:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:33:25 I am trying to make a gimbal engine by just formulating the concept. I concluded if i make pistons over suspensions, it should allow me to control the direction the engine goes, but how do i translate the linear speed of the suspension into the engine getting angular velocity to the side
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:37:54 i was just looking at that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:37:59 actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:38:06 Yeah i think i might use that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:33:52 I made a gimbal
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:34:43 At the unfortunate cost of it looking VERY bad****
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:10:05 gimballed 1st stage
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:16:24 this first stage by itself can provide me the rocket scientist I role
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:16:51 incredible
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:55 hey can you help me out you have a rank role, can you tell me how exactly do i go through
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:19:15 Alr
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:19:18 i mean i did that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:19:21 already
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:19:33 how do i submit do i just say $new in <#384027830192832513> ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:22:22 there
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:22:28 submitted my rank request
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:24:31 Are gimbals technically pitch and yaw?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:24:34 I think so
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:38:52 boo
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:39:00 i gort a rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 19:32:17 and it lands
creations-chat 2021-08-27 19:34:02 Anything noticeable to add? If not i'll post on creations
creations-chat 2021-08-27 19:36:05 You know what?? i'll add boosters to the side
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 19:39:20 400 block rocket that matches all criteria for rocket scientist II so far
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 19:39:29 but i'm gonna go for rocket scientist III
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 20:32:07 WOW i was not expecting this much
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 20:32:13 I thought it was still at 700
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 20:51:30 LETS GOOOOOOO

plane-crazy 2021-08-27 21:21:43 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 21:22:29 <@!304653509393907716> told me to post this video for him of his rocket https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514568661734916121/880921873137958922/Roblox_VR_2021.08.27_-_18.07.51.11_Trim.mp4
creations-chat 2021-08-27 21:25:01 Yeah that's because i was afraid of reaching the height limit and i am not aware how to fold it sideways for more height
Sure thing, if you can link me a youtube video i'll watch later
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:19:46 dude i can't make anything other than rockets and mechs because i find anything else boring
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:19:57 sure flying a plane is cool but i dont like building them
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:21:16 i know how mechanical principles work
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:21:29 maybe i can't replicate them that much on the game but
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:22:09 i did a suspension car with a suspension but
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:22:13 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:22:18 i typed the wrongf thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:22:28 with a center rod and swaybar
general 2021-08-28 12:36:07 Good norming
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:40:43 everything else that is not a rocket is so boring to build for some reason :((
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:41:24 yeah wedges only stick to the flat surface right
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:42:00 so the pyramid wedge would essentially be a block that only welds to a point
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:42:43 could be useful for pivoting
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:44:53 Do people build rocketplanes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:45:49 I'm gonna build a b-29 bomber complete with a bell x-1 payload that will go 1300 speed hopefully
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:46:34 or maybe i reduce it to 700 using mph
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:47:01 i think speed is probably mph not kph
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:47:37 Not your fault the n*zis did a bunch of experimental aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:47:44 yeah i mean which one fits better
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:48:59 My biggest build is like a 3 stage rocket its not that good looking through
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:49:07 got ratiod on <#384025409945337856> :((
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:49:34 Atleast my build gave me the Rocket Scientist IV rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:51:05 unfortunately the gimbal engine i use on my rocket makes a swas shape because i had to make it 3x3
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:52:17 i painted them so you can barely notice but
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:52:21 its unfortunate
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:53:27 Unfortunately i think it will fail on the <#384025409945337856> stage
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:53:43 rule idk: no motorlock no points
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:54:23 Oh yeah but its a very common practice there it seems
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:55:44 it might be in a swas shape but atleast it works very well
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:56:01 the engine i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:56:03 not the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:56:45 I think the problem is that it's a wooden ship and it has a large decal on the front
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:57:43 i have 5 separate keybinds on my rocket (not counting wasd) just so i can stage properly :///////
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:58:35 how can i make a round nosecone thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:58:54 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:59:06 i mean it's a solid strcutre
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:59:09 is there a wedge

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 16:59:27 i'm not usin g moterr !! >:((((((((
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:00:34 this nosecone looks stupird
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:07:48 can i fit a micro plane inside here
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:08:02 3x3
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:08:05 weird angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:16:03 can this fit
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:40:10 can 5x5 fit a plane inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:40:47 the hole in the middle is
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:40:49 it's 7x7
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:41:24 All i gotta do is make a 3x3 plane maybe a 5x5 if i do it correctly
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:44:03 Problem is i wanted to make like
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:44:08 an X-1 inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:44:25 I might have to just hang it on the bottom of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:46:05 A b-29 superfortress
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:46:28 rounded one
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:47:13 is there a piece that tapers off on this because it looks very bad :(
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:47:54 I would but i can't bother launching it everytime
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 17:47:55 YESSS
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 18:09:52 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 18:10:09 if you look at a very very very parallel angle to the nose it looks normal
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 18:32:34 Ok dude but like I don't care
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 18:33:00 You don't have to document your beef with another underaged child
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 18:33:56 How do you vent through making fun of children
general 2021-08-28 23:08:39 how you guys even know how to insult one another
general 2021-08-28 23:13:28 oh great tf2 the game with 47 memory leaks the worst optimizing in any source game only comparable to garrys mod and the one with a massive cheater problem <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-08-28 23:14:04 Unfortunate
general 2021-08-28 23:14:34 how does a private server fix the memory leaks and the optimizing

general 2021-08-28 23:15:22 listen a 2004 game shouldn't run worse than a modern AAA title
general 2021-08-28 23:15:50 yeah it only does after you switch up the default settings lmao
general 2021-08-28 23:16:17 and the memory leaks do mean shit when it actually happens
general 2021-08-28 23:17:25 "been proven" do you know what a memory leak is
general 2021-08-28 23:17:44 Yeah memory leaks may not do anything other than litearlly crash your operating system if not taken care
general 2021-08-28 23:18:11 i don't think you know what a memory leak is
general 2021-08-28 23:18:30 a memory leak is when a program goes over it's allocated memory, too much and it might just completely crash the computer
general 2021-08-28 23:18:57 Yeah the memory leaks don't do anything when you have memory left around
general 2021-08-28 23:19:07 but if you don't youre gonna have a bad experience

general 2021-08-28 23:19:29 again look at that link
general 2021-08-28 23:48:33 the biggest red flag i've seen on roblox so far is if a game offers a gamepass to run
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 20:32:52 Making a jettd
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 20:33:03 for the first time
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 20:33:21 i copied the nose from the guy on my side

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 20:36:22 I don't want to motorlock details yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 20:36:32 mainly due to the fact ihave no idea what looks good
