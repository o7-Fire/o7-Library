plane-crazy 2021-02-26 19:13:29 i'm having troubles building my first jet, i know the basics and it flies but the nose keeps going downwards.
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 19:18:05 i tried that and it starts to only move up,
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 19:20:29 both before and after,
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 19:23:32 i have the engines at the back, and the model may be changed from what it is.
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 19:28:13 just a basic jet
help 2021-02-26 19:30:41 If I were to apply for a terrain specialist role, does it need absolute wheels? Or are conveyors as treads allowed?

plane-crazy 2022-09-07 09:49:57 Hey, I’m looking for a place to report someone who used a bad symbol on their sub and tried to justify it to me. There’s a little more they did but I don’t think it’s appropriate for this chat.
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 14:14:41 1940s German if you know what I mean
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:39:54 I modified a shredder swarm Into flares without weapons to throw off rockets to stop ppl from spawn camping people
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:40:30 ?
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:40:34 ?
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:40:39 What
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:40:59 I made a shredder *swarm*
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:11 And took the shredder bit off
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:23 And added a magnet
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:28 And now they flare
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:32 Can’t show rn
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:37 Actually
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:41:40 Holdup
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:45:24 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 16:48:19 I’ll show later
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:07:56 Hey hey!
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:08:10 I’ve got the photos and vid demonstrating my flares
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:08:25 apparently I can’t send them though..
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:11:19 Yeah I saw,
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:11:31 It’s nice to be in the community though
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:31:58 So I made these swarmer shredders right? But I took away the shredder bit to make them harmless and now use them as a sort of flare against people spawn camping jets that want to do combat tests
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:33:31 W or L
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:36:26 (Not shredders) (read it again)
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:36:47 Had to say shredders so you know what they look like (roughly)
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:36:55 They don’t have any weapon
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 18:37:08 Not. Shredders.
