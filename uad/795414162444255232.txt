general 2023-07-19 18:44:10 simply get better
general 2023-07-19 18:44:59 You could turn that into a custom aircraft
general 2023-07-19 18:45:14 Actually continue that one
general 2023-07-19 18:46:07 Also is that the Unsc infinity?

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:28:47 weird to see the map without the train station
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 15:10:56 summer event shouldve released months ago but it didnt
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 15:15:25 Signs broke months ago, you have to paint them from behind
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 04:54:59 Chernobyl woman
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:01:33 has anyone elses rockets been working phenomenally after the updates?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:01:55 just trying to confirm if rick fixed them
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:02:08 ah
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:02:42 there were atleast 3 updates in a row
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:06:05 most of the nam users I see love to just boom and zoom the moment someone competent appears
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:07:45 built this thing with only cam lock
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:13:04 he probably just cam locked hover pads
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:16:59 Serbian
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:20:30 pvp is already a hellhole with the core tech leaked months ago
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:25:01 last time something like that got leaked it led to more people having builds that could deny physics entirely
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:29:39 when next shredder kill compilation
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:32:37 oh no
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:38:39 they ruined pvp with the guide
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:39:33 You would spot atleast one nam nam user in every pvp server
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:40:51 most of the ones i encounter really love bnz
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:41:16 Boom and zoom
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:44:49 rockets act like apcr when it encounters sloped armor
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:46:18 i meant like rockets deflect from the target like how apcr does against sloped armor in war thunder
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:48:32 Everytime i shoot an aircraft going above 750 most of the time it'll just deflect
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:49:07 pain
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:56 Retention is kinda needed for sustained turns
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:55:57 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:25:13 Im surprised hes still begging for that hover drive
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:47 core tech shredders exist now
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:29:18 I'll just use a battery
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:31 Stans beat nam in a 1v1
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:36:33 Bob the builder
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:38:06 You should totally convert one of those to a makeshift tank
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:22 cya
