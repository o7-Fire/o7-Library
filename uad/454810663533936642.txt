plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:07:57 potato computer
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:08:27 i searched for "test area" or "plane crazy 2 test" and got nothing, so thought maybe it was unfound
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:09:26 nothing for "secret"
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:10:02 and nothing for coral
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:10:13 so everybody already knew about the secret area, or the coral
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:11:06 nothing about it on the wiki either, but its probably outdated/nobody working on it
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:11:38 can confirm
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 21:13:05 that's awesome
