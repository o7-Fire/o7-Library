bug-reports 2020-10-06 20:04:46 So i have experienced this bug before, it is VERY annoying, it happens with signs and text throughout the whole build, so in my case i am building the H-4 Hercules, and i was putting the tail registration number on (NX37602) When doing so, i found that *NX* was tagged, i easily got around this by typing *N X*. when i moved the *N X* to the tail of the plane, it tagged, it also tagged on the other original text. It put a stricter chat filter on the signs and text than before and theres no way to reverse or get around this.
bug-reports 2020-10-06 20:10:05 it tightens the chat filter on signs
bug-reports 2020-10-06 20:10:46 and its not a reasonable chat filter, it will tag literally anything you put in
creations-chat 2020-11-26 15:04:17 yeah it very much does need a bigger base
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:11:23 why so little upvotes on the ship?
creations-chat 2020-12-01 23:14:34 My grandfather was on that ship, he was in on it from 1964-1966 in vietnam.
he was guiding the 5 Inch naval batteries when they were shelling villages and things
he also oversaw the DASH QA-50 Drone from time-to-time.
creations-chat 2020-12-02 00:59:58 lol <@456226577798135808> is being toxic
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:05:22 hes very stubborn and wont like being disrespected
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:09:06 but we have a reason
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:13:51 the sad thing is i have worked for weeks building a ship, (33 upvotes) and i spent 2 seconds making a rock and it has almost as many upvotes
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:15:44 you're stupid
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:17:46 yes, that is what i mean, <@456226577798135808> is being dumb here and trying to act smart
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:45:25 Bear, lord nobly, goodmanfrenchfrir, and me made it lol
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:47:54 We were legit in the same server and VC talking about it
creations-chat 2020-12-02 01:50:19 Ima stop sending rocks, it has really gotten unfunny
creations-chat 2020-12-02 23:19:41 <@!335599526414909451> the front of your B-17 is too rounded
creations-chat 2020-12-09 15:14:48 I’ve seen worse
creations-chat 2020-12-09 15:19:43 Why do people put reference images in creations, you arnt supposed to do that.
creations-chat 2020-12-09 15:23:12 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-12-09 15:25:14 See, I told you, you shouldn’t put reference images
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:08:56 i dont want to make it taller
i could but it would be alot of work, and i think its good as it is
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:13:38 <@!516692337750179841> whats wrong with my FT-17
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:15:39 <@!516692337750179841> you do better.
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:18:19 <@!701392731754201158> yeah yours isnt bad, 

(<@!693508083145769101>  almost any Su-27 is scaled down, su-27s are huge)
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:21:04 im going to stop putting builds in creations for a bit, i feel like im not getting honest upvotes because it looks like im spamming.

v Make the color lighter
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:23:11 change up the nose, it could be better
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:26:52 yeah i know, it should go up at an angle, which i could have done if i was thinking ahead
creations-chat 2020-12-21 18:50:55 what do you guys think of the A-10?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 19:56:34 no its not, and yes bear and i are friends of thrizet, if you know me i dont ever use tutorials.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:00:11 <@!527092191189925918> im to lazy to get a rank, check my name, i have a crap ton of builds, none of which are anywhere close to a tutorial. 

Wait a second, why are you guys searching up tutorials in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:04:51 theres one other paint version i know for the A-10, and i did the grey camo, 

LEGIT EVERY A-10 HAS THE SAME PAINT
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:06:57 
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:10:26 there is 1 other paint scheme, but ive only seen that once. 

if you have common sense you dont need proof
and im sad that people started downvoting
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:12:59 i hate how i spend 5 hours on an A-10 and end up getting accused of copying a 22:59 tutorial.
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:16:55 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:17:17 tong doesnt like talking
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:17:29 and i still dont know why is isnt in the server
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:17:31 yeah lol
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:18:36 thank you, someone with more common sense than <@!611251614178869269>.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:20:37 yeah thanks for the 6 downvotes
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:25:09 yeah, im kinda (really) upset about it being mine, because this probably took down my reputation, and i got 7 downvotes, (why is it going up, somebody stop this)
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:28:10 not very likely, before i hit 24 upvotes, 0 downvotes, now its at 26 upvotes, 8 downvotes, yes i should, im to lazy and i dont really know how
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:30:51 wait can i skip ranks, can i go from no ranks to aeronautical III
creations-chat 2020-12-21 20:49:50 key word:

creations-chat 2020-12-23 22:04:18 what do you guys think of the H-4,
creations-chat 2020-12-29 05:00:06 Because plane crazy is very realistic, so realistic that snow doesn't form outside of the earths atmosphere yet.
...obviously...

creations-chat 2021-03-06 01:13:57 <@!697893501274161325> <@!523671224908251136> what is the problem with my spitfire. (why did you downvote)
creations-chat 2021-03-06 03:30:08 Yeah, I get that feeling quite a bit, but I still do not understand why you downvoted my aircraft
creations-chat 2021-03-06 15:04:29 There are no parts or references from any kind of tutorial
creations-chat 2021-03-06 15:07:04 Lol the props are basic, everybody uses those, and the wing design is from my old spitfire
creations-chat 2021-03-06 15:09:22 I can put a picture in a couple minutes, I just woke up
creations-chat 2021-03-06 15:18:06 I would have used half triangle wedges but I was to lazy and tired to do that bit of motorlock

Yah I guess that’s making it worse
creations-chat 2021-03-06 15:22:16 even if i wanted to do a tutorial, i wouldnt do yours

creations-chat 2021-03-24 01:27:06 Yes, exactly what I was thinking, 
The wings look like a spitfire (other than the biplane part), along with the nose, but the tail and fuselage is that of a hurricane
creations-chat 2021-03-26 00:56:34 Paint job means nothing
creations-chat 2021-03-26 01:01:10 Why would you ping me

creations-chat 2021-04-03 04:05:57 <@!788607335680704544>, I love the F-14 but you aren't supposed to put WIP's in creations
creations-chat 2021-04-03 04:49:04 I think this is actually the first time anyone in pcc has been remotely useful, the compilation would be one single event.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 06:45:54 I would show you if it wasn't 02:45 in the morning, 
I'm going to bed now.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 23:38:55 I’m traveling right now, so I’m in the car, I can’t really do that at the moment
creations-chat 2021-04-07 22:52:30 yeah, the lines arent very realistic (though not completely inaccurate).
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:30:06 <@!744540626980307081> why did you downvote already?
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:33:32 ^
creations-chat 2021-04-22 00:31:34 agreed
general 2021-04-27 19:54:22 okay
general 2021-04-27 19:54:58 ok
creations-chat 2021-05-01 22:47:34 i cant really do that easily and without anything exposed, thanks for the feedback though
creations-chat 2021-05-03 21:46:59 I know a guy...

creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:30:21 yes pizza seasoning best
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:33:03 That’s the whole point of this build lol it’s supposed to be a joke. But knowing PCC it will get quite a bit of attention
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:35:32 Yes but I didn’t use the 1/4 teaspoon crushed cumin
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:45:24 I’m glad to see some people appreciate pizza seasoning

Pizza is in the kitchen
creations-chat 2021-06-29 05:49:08 I spend time researching what pizza seasoning was, I didn’t even know it existed until earlier today
