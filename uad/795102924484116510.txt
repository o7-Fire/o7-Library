plane-crazy 2021-03-22 04:14:14 I'm so sorry if this is the wrong chat to ask this in, but what can motor lock be used for? I've seen people build underground bases with it so I'm curious what else it can do.
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 04:14:59 thanks
help 2021-03-22 04:16:02 What exactly can motor lock do?
help 2021-03-22 04:17:06 eh that works lol, thanks
help 2021-03-29 18:05:55 Is there an absolute top speed in plane crazy?
help 2021-03-29 18:07:34 wow
bot-central 2021-03-30 05:38:25 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:42:38 I use them all the time when I'm fighting someone so it should be fine
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:43:52 no idea, I mean you should be able to but then again I've never tried that
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:44:48 also I've been hit plenty of times even with my conveyor engine
in like 5 seconds lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:45:22 for example, I'll engage the engine but as soon as I start moving the pylons on my ship get shot off
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:46:04 or (on my screen) I'll dodge a missile but then a few seconds later I'm down
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:46:25 basically a piston and a conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:46:33 it's REEEEEALLY fast
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:46:43 ok, well not that fast but it's fast
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:47:11 the conveyor is placed behind the piston, and the piston extender thingy is facing into the conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:48:03 oh, is that how it works?
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 05:48:23 huh, I thought it was magic lol
creations-chat 2021-03-30 05:56:55 looking very nice!
help 2021-03-30 07:04:45 ok every time I get shot/blow myself up in my starship my entire game freezes and I have to use task manager to shut it down. it's only this one ship that this happens to. anyone know what's going on?
help 2021-03-30 07:06:32 it's not even a big build, if anything it's one of my mediumish sized builds so it's not like the size is messing it up
help 2021-03-30 07:40:35 For some reason my ships are turning, but it's perfect. I can turn very well at high speeds all of the sudden and I'm not sure why. Even my largest ship is preforming much better. I've had this happen before but it stopped a day or two later. Anyone able to tell meh what's going on so I can keep doing it?

I built a 2k+ block build and I want to give a copy to a friend. Is there ANY way I could just let them quickly copy and paste it? Or do they have to manually place each block?

help 2021-10-29 06:03:50 welp this is gonna be awhile
