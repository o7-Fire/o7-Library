general 2018-11-06 05:43:18 when you accidentally colour the inside of your jet turbine and you have no idea how
general 2018-11-06 05:43:43 that could actually work for arena mode but would be laggy when spammed
general 2018-11-06 05:43:45 so it might get limited
general 2018-11-06 05:43:51 to like 5-15

bug-reports 2018-11-10 02:02:52 Some creations like getting split in half.
bug-reports 2018-11-10 02:03:19 It can be fixed by adding a single block at wherever the glitch line is but still it's annoying
bug-reports 2018-11-10 03:08:12 im talking about a diff bug
bug-reports 2018-11-11 01:08:18 Giant bug. Arena rockets work in normal worlds. I recommend a really quick fix rn

plane-crazy 2018-11-12 05:19:56 any difference between jet engines and rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 05:20:17 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 05:20:22 so basically pick jet engines for astehtics
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 05:20:30 unless you want a flamethrower
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 06:43:37 when you look at data limit and see that its at 215k and you get scared

plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:27:18 <@!238825322508845056> place blocks from the other direction
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:27:32 then you wont be affected by block placement glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:30:04 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:31:27 ha you thought
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:31:44 that i was going to say the words "something random"
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:32:04 but little did you know, you would be expecting that
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:32:11 thus meaning it is not random
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:32:33 o h
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:32:51 <@!238825322508845056> place the blocks directly on the floor
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:32:58 that also works
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:33:31 what is this discord extension hurrrrr

plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:09 we tend to stray away from these things
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:13 or in my case
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:21 get flung to narnia from these things
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:46:45 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 15:47:23 but its basically abusing the hecc out of your suspension by using 25

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:14:09 i also realized i need to recreate this turret 2 more times
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:14:14 paaain
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:15:42 we need an underwater engine, but make jet engines and rocket thrusters not work underwater
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:03 because i dont like watching a plane go under my boat and abuse me from underneith
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:22 aaaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:26 i loaded instead of saved
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:28 time to die
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:59 this is how i lost 2 things now
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:17:03 i feel paaainn
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:17:37 yaaaay its in my autosave
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:17:39 time to alive
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:18:33 ok so inner wedges dont save colour
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:21:12 we all know that god himself
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:21:33 bows down to the people who can actually tell wtf is going on when they rotate a 1x3 corner wedge
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:34:19 ok i was reading the chat above
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:34:28 and apparently half blocks cause lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:34:32 uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:34:52 no wonder why my aircraft carrier drops my dps down to 10
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:34:57 fps*
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:14 oohh
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:17 not lights
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:25 i thought he meant light blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:31 like half blocks an
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:37 wait half wedges cause lag?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:35:41 heck
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:36:32 cool you made the tardis but b 29
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:37:19 anyways if anyone hits my aircraft carrier with a rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:37:23 rip fps
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:37:27 instantly
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:37:56 my aircraft carrier creates bOth
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:38:14 along with some latency because the server would be crying
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:39:36 reason is because i didnt want to get ripped to pieces by arena guns so i coated the entire thing with half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:39:57 and 7x1s underneith so a single rocket doesnt just yeet the whole thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:40:12 but a single rocket that hits the half blocks causes stupid amounts of lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:40:22 basically
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:41:01 i cant think of any specifically good ways to counter arena guns
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:41:18 oh right i created the penultimate lag machine before
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:41:41 warpdrive and tons of wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:41:55 drops fps to 5 and it was only 400 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:42:02 and my computer is pretty decent
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:42:13 thou idk if it still works anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:42:26 w o a h
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:46:52 that does not look healthy
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:50:11 can someone suggest nicer looking arena guns lol. rn its a floating block
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:50:43 ok

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:16 he'll just think he got perm banned after like the first 3 months
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:26 you dont need to flood the entire chat to banish him
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:33 ok why is someone speaking russian
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:40 no russian
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:52 aaaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:04:12 james
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:04:26 or you could just say

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:10:44 why would anyone at all try to post nsfw into a roblox server for a reason besides raiding
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:06 theree would be like 9 yr olds here
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:41 there still is a direct link to it and roblox
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:54 so your basically sending nsfw into roblox
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:58 im innocent
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:12:24 though i was scarily close to sending some in the wrong channel in a diff server
the-dump 2018-12-11 23:19:10 ok
the-dump 2018-12-11 23:19:17 but is he
the-dump 2018-12-11 23:19:19 thanos
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:30:27 i feel like anyone you guys specifically trust should get a role. no perms other than the ability to chat and suggest in the other channels
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:34:10 build a very large 2 legged walker
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:01:35 we need more quality of life changes

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:24 o h
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:22:26 changing controls and stuff on multiple things is p a i n
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:22:37 imagine making like a walker with 8 legs or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:23:34 its a warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:23:39 add it with a thousand wings and what not
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:23:48 creates an endlessly laggy object

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 19:35:59 this is too accurate
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 19:36:31 multiple motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 19:36:46 yes i know im genius
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 19:37:01 ha you wanna freeze your game? use light blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 19:37:23 any light works
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:29:57 hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:06 hmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:11 hMMMMMM
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:18 somethings seems very off
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:23 also begone thot
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:36 oh jesus you have too many roles
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:30:57 you can actually get his disc banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:31:12 since its against discord rules to create alts for the sole purpose of trolling or raiding a server
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:31:21 begone thot
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:31:52 t h o t
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:09 100k days is close enough to a permaban
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:16 unless your fine with waiting 300 years to come bac
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:26 which is wehre you can get them banned on discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:54 if you use alts for the sole purpose of trolling or raiding a server, its bannable on discord
the-dump 2019-01-05 23:49:53 i can edit it
the-dump 2019-01-05 23:49:58 just no gifs or anything
bug-reports 2019-01-06 03:30:17 join friend option in pvp doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 03:51:39 we need a toggle mode for thrusters
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 03:51:42 someone suggest that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:52:04 question
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:52:11 are aarena guns still client sided
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:52:21 because i feel like they are client sided for vip servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:52:51 like they shouldn't be any different but they are client sided for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:17:47 he's not lying
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:17:54 the pixels are off at the same spots for both images
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:18:02 i doubt he would make the same exact mistake twice
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:19:55 can someone suggest no-clip flying mode in ur test zone?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:20:03 because that would be useful as nut
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:20:27 dunno about that thou
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:20:39 sometimes that happens when ur loading or someone is lagging the hell out of the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:20:53 i've never actually hit that amount of speed so i can't have a direct say thou
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:21:02 k
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:16:12 can someone suggest a buff to arena guns? right now they are useless unless your fighting someone who can't move, so make it so that they are anti air sort of things, and instakill wing parts or something
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:16:38 because right now, unless your target can't move or doesn't want to move, theres not much of a point
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:16:47 stacking looks ugly as nut
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:17:12 oh right the fact that u can shoot through ur blocks is also dumb
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:17:40 exactly. there isnt a point in using arena guns
general 2019-01-10 01:30:00 very noice
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:33:04 automatic controls are great except they can barely turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:33:11 havent tried manual controls yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:34:28 oh god what happened to your legs what is this abuse
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:34:51 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:35:03 i had that happen in other games
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:35:14 you turn into a polygon
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:35:55 i should probably collect my roles
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:36:45 maybe theres a random loose block somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:37:13 rocket thrusters and sideways rockets to turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:37:27 for big creations, you create a lot of noise
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:37:31 which is a +
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:37:46 or a warp drive if ur into dat
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:38:01 sideways ones set them to A or D
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:38:11 put them at the back so it rotates the boat
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:38:27 the sideways ones
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:38:40 dont put it on the middle or you wont actually rotate and just move sideways
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 01:50:39 the second i get my server exterminator role people are going to suddenly hate me
creations-chat 2019-01-10 01:52:55 https://youtu.be/_HmWyhmtCoo
creations-chat 2019-01-10 01:53:00 server exterminator? note that i just want the role my self esteem is too low to get people to vote on this xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:04:37 can i technically get the bomber role if someone kind of flew into the bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:04:48 i mean it went something along the lines of this
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:05:05 i wanted to blow myself up out of bordom and flew into my own bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:05:11 but someone followed me and i didn't see
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:05:14 🤔

bug-reports 2019-01-10 04:41:41 you can only activate three hotkeys or whatever at the same time
bug-reports 2019-01-10 04:41:52 frustrating if you want to go forward, up and turn at the same time or something

plane-crazy 2019-03-02 22:30:06 literally
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 22:30:10 they suck in blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 22:30:16 is more of a vaccuum than a magnet
