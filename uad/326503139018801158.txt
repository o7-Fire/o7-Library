plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:13:55 is it just me or should there be a larger build area
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:15:14 i mean cant all build areas be expanded by decreasing the amount of players?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:21:04 we should have whitelist
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:21:31 so we can build with friends and our friends can use our crafts
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:22:00 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:22:14 how do you even make a suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:22:26 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:23:10 also there is no pined suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:23:58 o

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:25:16 also i think anyone in the main pilot seat should be able to control the jet
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:51:43 ok
creations-chat 2019-02-14 06:04:40 target destroyer and target practice
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 19:51:04 there should be a ghost block in the game

plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:10:07 or in creations
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:12:23 
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:12:47 the middle is a gyro
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:12:57 which i use for my orbital cannon
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:13:18 so the gyro is used to anchor the cannon mid air so i can aim
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:13:35 not for the gyro
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:13:40 not why its special
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:13:54 its not ment to keep the build up right
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:14:06 its there so i can rotate the build while anchored
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:14:36 has that ever been done
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:15:17 is that not good for the inventor?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:15:33 yea but no one used it
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:16:12 i dont think anyone has done it
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 06:19:05 also what about the modeller role

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:29:27 how much is yours
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:29:41 how much blocks
bug-reports 2019-02-19 03:30:32 randomly when i launch the pilot seats dont work even if i jump in and out
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:59:06 why is the max data size so small
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:59:16 max save data
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:00:05 i have one slot that takes up 90% of my save data
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:00:57 will save data ever be incressed
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:01:20 why
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:02:21 than why does a game like build a boat seem to not have a max save data
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:02:44 true
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:03:11 good point
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:34:15 Why is it everytime you try joing different servers you keep joining the same one
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:16:44 why s there almost nothing orginial that people make
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:04:27 i hate searching for servers with working rockets
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:05:01 <@!121007634714329089> how large are your saves
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:05:57 i have a 3500 block orbital cannon
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:06:53 if you search my name i posted screenshots befor
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:07:41 my friend says there is no such thing as orbital cannons yet (fun fact) it is illegal to add something like bombs/missles on spacecrafts
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:07:45 yup
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:08:28 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:08:37 XO

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:11:03 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:12:01 is it just me but i dont think much people know how to be original all they do is make modles

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:12:26 ... never heard of those
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:12:49 XO
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:13:14 my orbital cannon is better its like a turret but it moves
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:14:13 
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:14:19 also i made a mini orbital cannon
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:14:52 honestly my friends just complained about my stuff being to large
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:15:43 (side not) i dont know a lot of stuff

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:17:05 XO
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:17:07 AFK
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:04:55 why am i not getting roles for any of my builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:05:42 also there should be roles compared to the amount of keybinds someone uses
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:09:10 true
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:09:32 why do game creators never shut there game and restart it after big updates
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 04:14:50 i wish there was a like a half block thruster
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:33:57 there is a reason vtol's were invented
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:34:07 hey
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:34:43 you think thats funny
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:35:04 i have made decently small vtols
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:35:58 you know what always bugged me about building games i mean i mention this alot but no one is ever realy "unique"
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:36:31 its one of the things i try doing
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:36:55 what do you mean i failed
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:37:24 i not talking about functions im talking about build style
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:37:58 i want to see that being a thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:38:39 im going to post a screen shot of my build and can you tell me how unique it is
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:39:09 
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:39:33 on a scale of 1-10 
10 being the most orignal
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:39:49 WAIT HOW IS THAT A DORITO
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:40:32 this yellow jet isnt really original
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:41:04 what about one of my jets
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:41:19 
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:41:24 how original is this
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:41:50 ive never seen something so beutiful in my life
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:42:34 mostly for me when i rate someone on originality i compare it to things as if it already has been created in game, in a movie, or in real life
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:43:03 self destruct mode
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:43:16 XO
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:43:35 yea why not
bug-reports 2019-03-02 07:15:09 
bug-reports 2019-03-02 07:15:14 can someone explain
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:20:04 im sad this new update ruined half my crafts
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:20:23 now like all my stuff is off balenced
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:21:01 they should un update it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:21:25 yea ive made target practice jets
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:22:21 they made hellium more heavy
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:24:05 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518331397161746432/553419173296865280/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:30:53 Who do i ask to get ranks again
creations-chat 2019-08-16 02:34:08 Orbital Cannon
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 20:46:17 my missels dont work on pvp
bug-reports 2019-08-16 20:47:56 my rockets dont work
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 04:46:22 its really anoying how rockets explode early
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 11:27:30 i wish rockets had longer range i want to be able to be high above the edge of the map and be able to snipe someone all the way across the map
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 11:28:13 what do you mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 11:28:23 im refering to the missles
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 11:31:02 they should make a rail gun (a weapon with insanley slow reload; a laser beam; a lot of damage; and infinete range with short duration)
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 11:37:03 good question
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:44:10 they should add a function where you can make it that you can choose to make a team (the team would be a things that disables friendly fire between a group)
bug-reports 2020-07-16 22:22:00 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:30:29 i went fast enough i broke into the scientific notation
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:34:16 you are wrong i did not exploit
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:34:42 i was testing out my runway when my runway happened to glitch out
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:35:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:35:04 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:35:25 when i tried moving it up the thing straight up glitched
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 08:36:04 i dont know why if i unanchor my craft and spam up/down my thing will glitch out
bug-reports 2021-05-09 08:32:42 i think something with how the pistons are set up on my craft cause my game to crash if i use them a few times (if i use my pistons a bunch my game crashes)
bug-reports 2021-05-10 00:47:12 my craft crashes people. i want it to be fixed
general 2021-05-12 00:08:30 .
bug-reports 2021-05-12 07:49:01 I've been testing my craft a lot.  If i use the craft un-anchored for a short period (a minute or so) i get kicked from the game with the message in the screenshot
