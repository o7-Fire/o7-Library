general 2022-03-19 19:14:27 Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 4,000 have been of any significance.

So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn‚Äôt understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks that came to life. So we called them ‚Äògods‚Äô and 'demons‚Äô, begged them to spare us, and prayed for salvation.

In time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.

Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.

While the rest of mankind dwells in the light, we must stand in the darkness to fight it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and normal world.

We secure. We contain. We protect.

general 2023-05-27 12:06:36 So you sent the message?
general 2023-05-27 12:06:40 Or was it me who sent it
general 2023-05-27 12:06:51 As technically the person who sent the message crafted the message to be that way
general 2023-05-27 12:07:09 I can see that the people of this server do not have enough braincells to comprehend my speech.
general 2023-05-27 12:08:06 I see that it cant be classified as a joke, as normally a joke is something 'New'. Meanwhile I have seen that god damn fucking GIF hundereds of times.
general 2023-05-27 12:08:09 Plus it was not funny
general 2023-05-27 12:08:44 So it could be considered a statement, of which is your opinion, OF WHICH yours does not matter
general 2023-05-27 12:09:17 What now, calling anyone who has more braincells than you a Supremacist?
general 2023-05-27 12:09:58 Anyone here thought <@835005635359801406> 's joke to be funny?
general 2023-05-27 12:11:39 supremacist
noun
a person who believes that a particular group, especially one determined by race, religion, or gender, is superior and should therefore dominate society.
general 2023-05-27 12:11:54 Any mention of smartness?
general 2023-05-27 12:12:53 Yes but that would be called Narcissism and not supremacy, And even then, I said people of this server have no brain-cells, most people outside do have some form of intelligence.
general 2023-05-27 12:13:52 You are getting really muddled up here...
general 2023-05-27 12:14:50 Supremacy, in Layman's terms, is one group of people attacking and demoting another group.
