general 2023-05-24 21:48:10 anyone know how fast the plane crazy speed is or what unit it is? like mph or khm?
general 2023-05-24 21:52:46 do you know what studs per second is in mph or kmh by chance?
general 2023-05-24 21:57:44 thx for the info, I'm building a space ship and knew the speed I needed (because I like accuracy,) but did not know how fast the speed in pc was. I can now do some conversions and estimate the actual speed.
