general 2020-08-14 16:03:51 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
general 2020-09-16 16:27:00 Russian bias will protect against all
general 2020-09-16 16:27:25 Uhhhhh
general 2020-09-16 16:27:32 Who are we?
general 2020-09-16 16:28:27 Guys guys guys

general 2020-09-16 16:29:33 What's your username for war thunder
general 2020-09-16 16:29:51 Okie dokie
general 2020-09-18 20:27:14 All I wish for this update is Nigel to come back and ghost shells to be fixed
general 2020-09-18 20:27:55 Yeah, until 1940
general 2020-09-18 20:28:25 Commander in the B1 bis had to do everything
general 2020-09-18 20:28:51 I'm not sure if the B1 bis had a stabilizer
general 2020-09-18 20:28:56 or apds
general 2020-09-18 20:29:18 H35 do be suffering doe
general 2020-09-18 20:29:51 But then again, the french and british thought ww2 is also going to be ww1: trench warfare
general 2020-09-18 20:30:54 The british had specialized tanks while the germans had multi. The problem with germans is that they always over engineer stuff lol
general 2020-09-18 20:31:18 War of attrition will not allow that lol
general 2020-09-18 20:31:24 Hello
general 2020-09-18 20:31:47 The russkis had more men then the germans had bullets
general 2020-09-18 20:32:27 Again, war of attrition; they (the russkis) can recover more than the germans
general 2020-09-18 20:33:40 That's why they partnered with the romanians. however, the fuel froze during the winter raid
general 2020-09-18 20:33:48 Logistical nightmares
general 2020-09-18 20:34:09 But they pushed back
general 2020-09-18 20:34:18 They had more machines than the germans
general 2020-09-18 20:34:26 Yes
general 2020-09-18 20:34:38 The IL-2 was the most produced aircraft
general 2020-09-18 20:34:54 It's war of attrition; the more you can recover
general 2020-09-18 20:35:32 Ik about the purges of the USSR
general 2020-09-18 20:35:57 This doesn't relate to the fact that more machines and manpower were still recruited
general 2020-09-18 20:36:37 The more you can recover, the more you can throw at the enemy. Look at the battle of stalingrad.
general 2020-09-18 20:36:55 Moscow, though was the capital of Russia, wasn't the turning point
general 2020-09-18 20:37:57 Stalingrad was, because of the german 6th army was there. The russkis defeated them.
general 2020-09-18 20:38:26 But yeah, French low br is fun. D 520 sparking more then the all the british aircraft tho
general 2020-09-18 20:39:13 It has less ammo count but it punches a lot
general 2020-09-18 20:39:45 N o
general 2020-09-18 20:41:30 When the
general 2020-09-18 20:42:05 Imagine the Hurricane mk  2B tho
general 2020-09-18 20:42:18 12 7.62 machine guns just blasting
general 2020-09-18 20:43:38 Pretty nice
general 2020-09-18 20:46:50 52 tons of steel crashing into the ground
general 2020-09-18 20:48:32 Anyone else got war thunder?
general 2020-09-18 20:58:03 Imagine climbing in an american plane
general 2020-09-18 20:58:14 This is made by spacefire gang
general 2020-09-18 21:04:13 smh my head
general 2020-09-18 21:06:26 And yet Stalin established the order 227: "not one step back". Again, the fuel froze and the Soviets were more fit into the winter than the germans, as the germans did not have the proper equipment for the winter. True, they had horses. However, I already mentioned the fact that the Germans weren't ready for the winter: meaning that the Germans didn't hurry up
general 2020-09-18 21:06:31 Fuel froze
general 2020-09-18 21:06:41 They didn't take sevastapol
general 2020-09-18 21:07:13 I mean, it's not about typing fast, it's typing the right thing 😛
general 2020-09-18 21:07:27 But THEY DID INVADE IN THE WINTER
general 2020-09-18 21:07:44 The germans took too long
general 2020-09-18 21:08:25 Fuel, snow and equipment, and leadership.
general 2020-09-18 21:09:05 It's about battle doctrine, technology, and familarity of terrain
general 2020-09-18 21:09:35 Are we talking about the same barbarossa or are you going off a tangent?
general 2020-09-18 21:10:12 I don't deny Napoleon's might, I was talking about the ww2 stuff lol
general 2020-09-18 21:10:40 Again, different leadership, equipment, and Napolean didn't worry about fuel
general 2020-09-18 21:10:46 See, it's not about the fuel
general 2020-09-18 21:10:53 You proved yourself wrong already
general 2020-09-18 21:11:28 > I telk you dude it is fuel
<@456226577798135808>
general 2020-09-18 21:11:42 It still needs fuel LOL
general 2020-09-18 21:12:23 You said earlier lol
general 2020-09-18 21:12:59 
general 2020-09-18 21:13:04 You are going about fuel lol. That was your original arguement
general 2020-09-18 21:13:36 So you change your point now
general 2020-09-18 21:13:46 Yeah?
general 2020-09-18 21:14:09 You said before it was fuel that limited operation barbarossa
general 2020-09-18 21:14:32 And now you claim a different point
general 2020-09-18 21:14:43 SO you did change your point
general 2020-09-18 21:14:48 ikr
general 2020-09-18 21:14:56 Ye
general 2020-09-18 21:15:17 In the end, Germany was doomed from the start
general 2020-09-18 21:15:36 wE wOulD'Ve wOn wIth uNlimItEd ReSouRcEs
general 2020-09-18 21:16:40 It did, along with numbers as well
general 2020-09-18 21:17:38 Yet you through enough people to the fight, war of attrition. Quanitity over quality
general 2020-09-18 21:17:48 Pog
general 2020-09-18 21:18:20 It was cheaper to replace a t34 then to repair it
general 2020-09-18 21:19:02 Tigers are overengineered tbh
general 2020-09-18 21:19:16 The 2s especially
general 2020-09-18 21:19:32 Imagine your krupstahl being penned by an m8
general 2020-09-18 21:20:15 Panzer 4s were reliable, so were M4 shermans
general 2020-09-18 21:20:35 It used to be panzer 3s early stages of the war
general 2020-09-18 21:21:00 Anybody else hate ASU 57s?
general 2020-09-18 21:22:04 R3 SPAA is cancer
general 2020-09-18 21:25:28 Gun depression weak tho
general 2020-09-18 21:25:41 Especially when they come behind you
general 2020-09-18 21:25:56 No, I meant countering the ASU
general 2020-09-18 21:26:18 But ASU is soviet
general 2020-09-18 21:27:14 Well, that's the thing about apdsfs; they always spall less but pen more
general 2020-09-18 21:27:39 As a british tank tree main, it'll fit me
general 2020-09-18 21:28:40 You don't speak enough acid attack
general 2020-09-18 21:29:15 Wait, <@!335599526414909451> what tank is your top rank?

general 2020-09-18 21:30:16 OTOTOTOMATIC
general 2020-09-18 21:31:21 That's not doing well, that's just russian bias in general
general 2020-09-18 21:31:36 Just pray to the RNG snail and you should be good
general 2020-09-18 21:32:35 
general 2020-09-18 21:32:40 is this tank worth it?
general 2020-09-18 21:33:18 You got the snail on your side I see
general 2020-09-18 21:33:40 Smurfing
general 2020-09-18 21:35:45 Ngl that sounded wrong in my head
general 2020-09-18 21:38:59 Was there a rule regarding insulting him?
general 2020-09-18 21:39:12 Or is there any?
general 2020-09-18 21:40:06 So, telling rickje that he wasn't funny was supposed to be a suggestion?
general 2020-09-18 21:40:12 That's why your blacklisted?

general 2020-09-21 16:40:19 F 22 got shot down in an exercise by the Rafale
general 2020-09-21 16:46:42 I don't think the F 22 is supposed to be for dogfights, rather BVR combat
general 2020-09-21 16:47:28 Considering the US battle doctrine, I don't think so
general 2020-09-21 16:48:06 They do have air superiority, but have different combat set
general 2020-09-21 16:53:16 Air superiority =/= dogfight
general 2020-09-21 16:53:31 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-09-21 16:53:40 No it doesn't mean that lol
general 2020-09-21 16:54:24 Heavy fighters in ww2 are considered air superiority fighters as well
