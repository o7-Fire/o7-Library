general 2022-06-15 10:27:14 that word isn't allowed ok ok
general 2022-06-15 10:27:26 lemme type that whole thing again
general 2022-06-15 10:30:04 so i joined some weird plane crazy group out of curiosity after seeing their weird chats about some experiments
i thought it was an rp lore but they were seriously conducting "experiments" on motors and vehicles
they told me their goal is to take over plane crazy with these builds and i doubt they actually discovered something new
they talk about vehicles going underground and ghost blocks and motors, teleportation etc.
they claim to have super duper good builds and they will make u seem worse by calling ur builds bad, and they idolise their leader much like the one germany had in ww2, saying hail etc
general 2022-06-15 10:30:16 i doubt they discovered anything new
general 2022-06-15 10:30:24 thank
general 2022-06-15 10:31:17 man even that paragraph didn't make me gain a level but seriously that group is strange
general 2022-06-15 10:31:24 💀💀💀

bot-central 2022-06-15 14:55:42 г
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:00:01 the people here are brutal when it comes to rating, if it isn't a 1:1 copy of the real thing ur build is based on, people mass down vote it
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:02:45 💀💀💀 big boy alert
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:04:47 nah im not complaining but im just looking at decent builds and half the votes are down its just surprising, i thought there would be more tolerance
general 2022-06-15 15:05:04 how get color for name
general 2022-06-15 15:05:25 how is ur name dark blue
general 2022-06-15 15:05:40 what the hell is pixel artist or expert
general 2022-06-15 15:05:58 pixel artist in pc? hardly any space for pixel art
general 2022-06-15 15:06:19 unless u fold it 4 ways
general 2022-06-15 15:06:39 or what, will a bomb appear under my doormat

general 2022-06-15 15:08:25 shitty giant karl gerat with treads and exposed motor lock but still
general 2022-06-15 15:08:44 yes yes i did go into ranks
general 2022-06-15 15:08:50 it doesn't say how to get the rank
general 2022-06-15 15:10:09 it just says if u have this thing with 1200 blocks then u get terrain sucker III
general 2022-06-15 15:10:13 or whatever
general 2022-06-15 15:10:16 so
general 2022-06-15 15:10:27 i have this thing with 1200 blocks or more that moves
general 2022-06-15 15:10:41 it doesn't say how to get this rank
general 2022-06-15 15:10:49 it just says if u have this vehicle u get it
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:11:07 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2022-06-15 15:11:20 amazing why didn't anybody tell me?
general 2022-06-15 15:11:25 this discord server is such a mess
general 2022-06-15 15:11:28 so many channels
general 2022-06-15 15:11:43 possibly but
general 2022-06-15 15:11:48 i would've seen it sooner
general 2022-06-15 15:12:12 ok i underestimated the space
general 2022-06-15 15:12:47 didn't bother reading that, it's like the terms and conditions of some thing that has useless info you can find out later
general 2022-06-15 15:13:15 aaaand what do you know i found out 😎👌
general 2022-06-15 15:13:27 no it's how i roll
general 2022-06-15 15:13:54 cad only showed me ranks, info and rules
general 2022-06-15 15:14:00 h e r e
general 2022-06-15 15:14:09 it doesn't have rank requests
general 2022-06-15 15:14:26 and ranks doesn't say USE rank requests
general 2022-06-15 15:14:39 it isn't
general 2022-06-15 15:15:01 only at the very itty bitty top
general 2022-06-15 15:15:09 the whole way it just says hall of fame
general 2022-06-15 15:15:32 on phone it doesn't bring it to the top
general 2022-06-15 15:15:46 i would've seen all this stuff if i was on my laptop
general 2022-06-15 15:16:08 due to the phone compressing discord it makes things longer to scroll and therefore less noticeable
general 2022-06-15 15:16:15 actually around 7 or 8
general 2022-06-15 15:16:25 i dont you just have a discord server issue
general 2022-06-15 15:16:36 lemme count the amount of channels
general 2022-06-15 15:16:51 idk, u are the ones calling me stupid
general 2022-06-15 15:16:57 lemme search
general 2022-06-15 15:17:04 and see how many channels
general 2022-06-15 15:17:15 who built that tank
general 2022-06-15 15:17:28 very narrow for that turret
general 2022-06-15 15:17:36 anyways lemme c
general 2022-06-15 15:18:26 not 1cm actually about 20 id say
general 2022-06-15 15:18:38 but maybe 21
general 2022-06-15 15:18:40 who knows
general 2022-06-15 15:19:32 the sound waves actually go inside the ears 🤓🤓🤓
general 2022-06-15 15:20:11 12 scrolls for ranks, it brings me to thw bottom
general 2022-06-15 15:20:16 i counted them
general 2022-06-15 15:20:20 oh man that was fun
general 2022-06-15 15:20:29 easier to annoy than tradelands discord server
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:20:49 mans plane looks 2d
general 2022-06-15 15:21:00 what
general 2022-06-15 15:21:05 patience and effort?
general 2022-06-15 15:21:21 but like i just asked a question to find how to submit builds
general 2022-06-15 15:21:27 and then u say ohhh noo so stupid
general 2022-06-15 15:21:30 phone bad
general 2022-06-15 15:21:35 ohhh so noticeable
general 2022-06-15 15:21:43 it brings u to the bottom of ranks on a phone
general 2022-06-15 15:21:55 yeah after complaining
general 2022-06-15 15:22:02 and saying ohhh potat is bad stupid
general 2022-06-15 15:22:19 only after half of the argument went through i got rank requests channel link
general 2022-06-15 15:22:36 tell them that please
general 2022-06-15 15:22:49 they are blaming me for a messy discord server on a phone
general 2022-06-15 15:22:58 so many hidden thingies
general 2022-06-15 15:23:06 i do but i am on my phone rn
general 2022-06-15 15:23:30 this is the messiest one so far
general 2022-06-15 15:23:43 man why did i join back
general 2022-06-15 15:23:50 i left this for the exact same reason
general 2022-06-15 15:24:32 then i went into ranks and saw something interesting and expected to see how to submit it
general 2022-06-15 15:24:49 and then i didn't bother scrolling up because i didn't think
general 2022-06-15 15:25:02 that anything would be up there
general 2022-06-15 15:25:23 guycot carbine
general 2022-06-15 15:25:27 i have that gun
general 2022-06-15 15:25:42 but i didn't see it anywhere
general 2022-06-15 15:25:47 id expect it to say
general 2022-06-15 15:25:54 submit it here bla bla bla
general 2022-06-15 15:26:00 not all the way at the top
general 2022-06-15 15:26:04 poorly written
general 2022-06-15 15:26:14 and at every one it says hall of fame
general 2022-06-15 15:26:31 why didn't they write hall of fame at the top too huh?
general 2022-06-15 15:26:40 this ranks channel is poorly poorly structured
general 2022-06-15 15:26:54 people were bombarding me with insults and things and other stuff
general 2022-06-15 15:27:00 did you expect me to read it
general 2022-06-15 15:27:22 im not gonna read 3 paragraphs just for it to say at the end oh yeah btw submit this here!!!
general 2022-06-15 15:27:56 and 300 links
general 2022-06-15 15:28:08 ok basically this server is poorly structured on  mobile
general 2022-06-15 15:28:18 i will now continue to build my shitty galleon airship
general 2022-06-15 15:28:42 that's what will be in the balloon
general 2022-06-15 15:29:14 at the end of each thing it says hall of fame but rank requests is at the top?
general 2022-06-15 15:29:23 on a phone it appears much much longer
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:29:37 ok
general 2022-06-15 15:30:08 ik
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:31:26 historically the german tanks used 3
general 2022-06-15 15:46:12 large troll
bot-central 2022-06-15 15:48:12 !rank
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:07:12 but thats what it literally looks like in tradelands 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bMX84zlHrM the larger ship, this is it being used in an rp battle
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:11:31 here it is in tradelands
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:13:55 i cant because it would have to be split since my ship is folded and it would be hard to align the split ropes to eachother, ill recolour the flag
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:21:46 try make this goofy ahh airship
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:23:52 from the picture it looks like its only armament is 1 aa gun and a bomb rack
general 2022-06-15 16:26:31 mm not for long
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:27:38 what, i have no idea how to use motor lock efficiently
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:30:27 nah dont because the only times i used motorlock i left all of it exposed and just did 1 motor after the other, i literally never used it because idk how to use it properly which is why all of my builds here in this server would be considered mediocre
bot-central 2022-06-15 16:39:34 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:46:09 maybe ur standards are too high? half of the builds on pc are worse than that jet but idk since i have only been on pc for 32 days and 13 hrs total so maybe ur right
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:48:23 its true though, nearly all of the builds i see in ur average pc server are terrible compared to that jet
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:55:01 how much time do people have in pc to have so much experience like how many days
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:59:22 i started playing in 2020 according to my first screenshot, wouldnt play very often since then, its awful that dont know how to do anything in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:10:17 what, what magnets, the chess pieces are picked up by 1 magnet attached to something
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:21:52 ok instead of experimenting i will continue to build builds that i like instead of what other people like
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:23:56 didnt expect my chessboard to be liked so much, its not hard to build
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:25:57 i think they need to change it to blacknames  so its uncomfortable to say <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:28:02 then make their names white
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:30:08 you know you can be a whitename and have a better build than people with a coloured name, right????
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:32:52 the only reason coloured names exist is just for validation and ego boost like why is so much segregation based on the colour of ur name and the way you place blocks in some roblox game with a playerbase of 30k people
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:34:59 y? u can see that it has a thing picked up in the screenshot
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:37:06 but a guy who doesnt have discord could have a far better build by chance, and you can just get these ranks by submitting a large decent build <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:39:42 whats still ugly with no details also im sure its still possible to get a rank if u just submit a half assed large build like what you probably did <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:41:43 didnt ask btw <:trollface:775024642104229898> also havent you heard of the standard going down? whitenames apparently increasing
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:44:42 people could ask you the same question if they took 1 glance at ur "about me" section
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:48:31 neither can you n00b master goofy ass
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:51:05 aint no noob master shit in that crappy tv show series

contest-chat 2022-06-15 20:55:32 goofy ahh tail
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:46:05 it looks much smaller than expected like when i saw the huge front, i expected a very long rear but it looks like it got cut off and replaced with this itty bitty rear that can't hold anything
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:48:08 your dirty mind
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:50:18 make the rear slightly hang over from the wheels but not too much since thats what real trucks have
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:52:42 and maybe with ur smart design skills, cover up the suspension of the back wheels with something
creations-chat 2022-06-16 09:00:50 yes that's good 10/10 better than anything i could come up with
creations-chat 2022-06-16 09:02:51 does ur truck use motor lock
general 2022-06-16 10:00:12 wth even is that on the front

general 2022-06-17 09:43:18 might build a roscale landkreuzer p1500 monster
general 2022-06-17 09:45:19 why not
general 2022-06-17 09:45:31 i won't make it shit i promise
general 2022-06-17 09:45:59 oh my goodness
general 2022-06-17 09:46:30 ive tried roscale rattes with treads but the vehicle is too big
general 2022-06-17 09:46:46 and a gustav but i got lazy
general 2022-06-17 09:47:17 but i did manage to make a massively oversized karl gerat with lots of exposed motor lock i was never bothered to fix
general 2022-06-17 09:47:37 but p1500 monster has such an easy structure
general 2022-06-17 09:48:17 actually p1500 monster would be too big for the plot
general 2022-06-17 09:48:24 too long
general 2022-06-17 09:48:27 so no treads
general 2022-06-17 09:48:53 for roscale
general 2022-06-17 09:49:02 how much is the area of the plot
general 2022-06-17 09:49:07 how many meters long is it
general 2022-06-17 09:49:11 in roscale
general 2022-06-17 09:49:30 you can't fold treads
general 2022-06-17 09:49:45 2 cut halves
general 2022-06-17 09:49:54 yeah they bind stuff together
general 2022-06-17 09:50:35 nope because when im folding, the tracks might fall off, and the magnets are very bulky
general 2022-06-17 09:50:56 they would also probably interfere with the firing mechanism
general 2022-06-17 09:50:58 and crane
general 2022-06-17 09:51:06 which would use magnets
general 2022-06-17 09:51:33 they'd just slip off
general 2022-06-17 09:51:57 ill try and experiment and see if it works
general 2022-06-17 09:52:07 ill also set it to loose parts only
general 2022-06-17 09:52:59 p1500 monster is 48m long
general 2022-06-17 09:53:17 probably
general 2022-06-17 09:53:33 there's this massive landship in the hall of fame
general 2022-06-17 09:53:50 that uses treads
general 2022-06-17 09:53:54 i wonder how he did it
general 2022-06-17 09:57:00 oh it's actually not there but i swear it was
general 2022-06-17 10:00:42 what how
general 2022-06-17 10:01:02 how do u bind the 2 pieces of track together
general 2022-06-17 10:01:55 k
general 2022-06-17 10:05:30 so it folds upwards
general 2022-06-17 10:05:43 k
general 2022-06-17 10:05:49 i see how it works
general 2022-06-17 10:06:14 nevermind
general 2022-06-17 10:06:25 im gonna have to do a spin lock
general 2022-06-17 10:06:31 idk how to do that
general 2022-06-17 10:06:50 so i fold it and then
general 2022-06-17 10:06:53 boom
general 2022-06-17 10:07:02 wow you are much nicer than the other ranked people
general 2022-06-17 10:07:12 instead of saying oh wow noob bad!! you want to help
general 2022-06-17 10:07:48 i put my chessboard with 160 score in a ticket
general 2022-06-17 10:07:54 i hope they reply someday
general 2022-06-17 10:08:09 show
general 2022-06-17 10:08:51 so the very long thing
general 2022-06-17 10:08:57 but how did u get it that big
general 2022-06-17 10:09:34 lol
general 2022-06-17 10:10:03 i can already spot a problem with ur 8 fold tread thing
general 2022-06-17 10:10:11 so i use motor lock to tighten treads
general 2022-06-17 10:10:20 it will be so tense when i try to fold it
general 2022-06-17 10:10:37 or if i dont tighten the tracks they'll be super slack
general 2022-06-17 10:10:48 as soon as ill spawn that 8 fold in
general 2022-06-17 10:11:01 the thing will glitch out because of how tense it'll be
general 2022-06-17 10:11:16 ill try it
general 2022-06-17 10:11:35 then how
general 2022-06-17 10:11:55 but then the wheels would be too spread out
general 2022-06-17 10:12:09 well the front one
general 2022-06-17 10:12:29 i use a different method instead
general 2022-06-17 10:12:34 yeah i put the front wheel close
general 2022-06-17 10:12:46 and then extend only the front wheel bar
general 2022-06-17 10:13:06 i could do it with rope
general 2022-06-17 10:13:13 so it gradually extends as i fold it
general 2022-06-17 10:13:34 and the suspension in the wheels pushes down on the tracks which tighten it too
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:15:38 or do 2 motor 2 so it can be a mouse controlled turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:15:52 don't forget the motor 3 that you place inside the block tho
general 2022-06-17 10:19:07 can u use disconnectors instead of tnt in public servers
general 2022-06-17 10:19:14 ok

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:12:37 i thought pc2 is just a revamp of pc 1 and it'll just be 1 game
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:12:55 shitty youtubers
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:13:21 so which one is it
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:13:38 ok im gonna assume u guys are trolling
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:13:49 and ill trust youtubers
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:13:59 u serious
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:14:09 for fucks sake i have to build the left side over
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:15:00 maybe i should be lazy and extend it with pistons
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:15:59 does that mean i also need to make the wheels wider to fit thicker tread
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:16:51 would u say the wheels are wide enough
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:27 ok
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:33 ill make it fatter
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:54 the amount of wheels is right tho, 23 on each side according to another photo
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:26 why couldn't the germans call it "your mother"
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:29 so fat
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:54 post somewhere else and ping me
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:21:48 <@877391100137070625> u sure it isnt wide enough? also the longer wheel is the wider one
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:21:52 should it be wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:08 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:19 the wheel?
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:25 what about the vehicle
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:52 aint no blueprint for this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:03 there are a few different renditions
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:11 this wideness
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:12 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:24 this wideness (this is what i want for it)
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:56 i think its about as wide as in this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:06 im just looking for the wideness of the space inbetween the wheels
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:14 i think its good enough <@877391100137070625>
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:30 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:40 actually nah a little bit wier
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:41 wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:44 pistons will do it for me
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:37 from the scale of the person in the drawing i think it should be wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:49 i might run out of motors for the treads
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:53 since its so fucking wide
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:26:13 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:27:51 i will keep it like that since according to a few photos i looked at it would be too wide
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:27:57 not like this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:28:20 i hope 900 motors will be enough
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:28:31 actually only 861
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:36 yes
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:47 the picture makes it have the illusion that its wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:55 so yeah its as wide as the other renditions
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:07 yeah probably
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:13 i added in 2 pistons to make it just a little bit wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:18 to have it roscale
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:38:24 the tracks make up nearly 2/3 of the wideness
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:38:49 i hope i have enough motors to make the treads
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:04 ill have to use gamma's tread fold technique
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:13 more like the krupp pub
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:37 its theorised that the p1500 monster was just an engineer after having a few drinks
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:47 or that its just a hoax made up by someone
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:40:08 yes
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:40:28 the cranes on it are wider than a maus 💀
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:41:15 i hope it will be able to offroad once finished

plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:36:28 2 deg up?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:36:36 wdym 2 deg
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:36:53 oh like the barrel length
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:37:15 how do i hide all the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:37:28 i can just do wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:37:39 oh thats where the frustrum is
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:37:44 you want me to make that bit ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:37:57 im still a long way away from making the gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:38:01 ill just see
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:38:09 first im gonna make the side panels
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:38:21 im gonna have to change the unfolding of the treads to unfold sideways so ill make em turn with motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:38:33 since the body will be in the way
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:25 i have 792
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:30 and i lack nearly all motorlock skill
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:36 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:42 oh no in pc
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:45 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:40:55 didnt see u guys were talking about rust
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:41:16 i lack lots of skill for that much time
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:43:29 <@877391100137070625> i just realised i lack the space to fold in the side plates and basically most of the body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:44:21 top of that is max height
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:44:38 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:44:57 the tip of that block tower is the top <@877391100137070625>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:45:17 how would that work
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:45:23 the front would interfere
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:45:33 and the length of the sides would crash into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:46:01 cameras and motor for the fold is in the way
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:46:54 gustav on wheels is not a tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:47:06 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:53:58 <@877391100137070625> yeah idk how to fold the tracks without the body blocking it since my idea doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:54:08 maybe i could use a motor2 on the body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:54:14 and move it away
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:54:18 and then fold it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:54:20 then rotate it back
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 12:54:33 and then lock it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 13:03:47 lol i went afk and u are still not here
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 13:03:54 anyways my method works
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 13:04:35 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 13:04:40 i wish you luck
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:52:21 <@877391100137070625> the motorlock makes it go down to a certain height and the thing refuses to go down more
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:52:43 i tried adding more and stuff like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:52:57 what
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:53:10 i flip the tracks then i press 6 to disconnect the connectors
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:53:18 and then it goes down down down and stops
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:53:22 just above the tracks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:53:26 its not even touching the tracks
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:59:53 not bothered to sign up to streamable
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 16:00:01 its probably cuz i just dont have enough motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 16:00:10 ill add more
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 16:02:47 mmm yes done
general 2022-06-18 17:44:42 just say shut up whitename and he'll be gone <@921250489281159231>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:11 <@877391100137070625> ok sorry for ping but
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:18 u know the way i have to move the body
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:20 to fold the treads
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:31 i cant
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:34 i tried so many methods
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:35 like
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:40 if i start building the left side
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:45:47 ok
general 2022-06-18 17:45:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:47:13 nobody responded to mine yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 17:47:19 but i put in all the info
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:06:44 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:14:27 ill flip it onto its side since the tread rear cant fold up like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:14:47 but then
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:14:54 i have no space for the top
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:15:12 motors at 1k torque say no
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:15:47 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:16:14 does it fold into the ground? didnt think so
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:16:48 it folds to the side or up
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:16:56 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:17:19 i have to fold the bottom tread down like this
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:17:36 see how it goes beneath the plot
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:17:55 the motors take the easiest route and they flip the upper part instead
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:19:07 id have to float up the length of the lower tread so it wouldnt compress and glitch
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:24:41 yeah the bottom tread wont fold up even with ur 90 deg fold
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:24:51 suspension doesnt even let me do flips
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 18:25:27 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:09:55 when i go up the tread goes all over the place
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:10:17 also i did the 90 deg folds wrong and i forgot what they look like
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:10:27 the thing is a mess now
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:10:30 ill just start over
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:11:27 itll be strange building a build sideways
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:11:59 have you ever built anything sideways?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:12:35 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:12:41 i wonder what ill use to turn it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:13:04 i think ill bring it up and put it on a set of pistons that will gently push it over
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:14:30 itll be like a whole row of them that will be near the top along a side skirt
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:14:42 it wont be attached to the actual build
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:17:32 1 issue: treads might slip off
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:18:07 ill build it ur way
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:18:17 for fucks sake why did i want to build this
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:18:46 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:18:51 unique ranked person
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:25:31 ok so when the motor turns
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:25:39 the motor just turns this
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:25:42 the top bit down
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:25:58 using computer mouse to draw
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:34:42 <@877391100137070625>
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:34:57 
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:35:05 motors turn
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:35:13 ground pressure forces top section to turn
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:35:26 and if i flip it up the treads get messed up
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:35:31 this is why idk if i should build it like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:36:11 thats what happened when i tried
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:36:26 even with 90 deg turns it would do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:36:35 thats just an example
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:38:56 so you want me to fold how you showed in the other pic with all the parts in the plot even though its basically impossible
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 19:39:17 because the ground pushes against the stupid motors
general 2022-06-18 22:50:21 you still believe in me right

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:04 your ratte is not 1:1 scale, my monster is 1:1 scale as you can see here
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:08 you fraudster
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:15 your ratte is a fraud
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:16 fraudster
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:26 oh well i measured mine with the in game scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:36 well actually no i measured
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:37 uhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:40 to the man in the photo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:46 as 1 roblox character
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:50 and it matches
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:13 according to another photo, monster is 48m long
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:21 which is how large
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:41 idc im keeping it at my size
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:59 cuz its proportionate to the man in the photo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:24:12 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/818488990889017354/987497430201286726/ezgif-4-132239b8fe.gif
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:25:17 72 speed <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:08 i made it realistic
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:15 and
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:19 lag slows mine down
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:23 so its super realistic
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:38 i also measured my monster by the wheel size
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:44 1 guy = half a wheel height
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:55 pretty accurate
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:27:12 so how many blocks long would 48m be???
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:02 it includes the gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:17 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:24 niiiice
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:35 let me count how long mine is
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:19 wow.... about half the length
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:31 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:31 but this photo counteracts that
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:41 why is the quality so crappy
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:43 hold on
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:48 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:49 this photo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:56 the people in it are tiny af
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:30:21 if my build was as long as it should be
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:30:26 the people on it would look too big
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:30:35 and also that includes the gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:30:37 lmfaoooo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:30:45 fuck that picture
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:31:30 <@412694102006824960>  another thing says its 124m long
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:31:38 the one that contains that picture
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:31:45 measure 124m into blocks plsss
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:31:48 im not good at maths
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:32:12 alr let me count
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:32:58 thats very small
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:07 ive seen pictures where the ratte looks larger
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:34:51 97 blocks long
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:06 mmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:08 so
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:21 id have to increase the size exponentially
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:26 if i was to make it 177 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:58 others say 25m
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:05 wiki says 25m*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:08 but the photo is this
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:09 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:27 there are many different variations
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:34 so my one is in the checkbox for scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:46 monster has a longer gun than gustav
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:52 according to photos
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:08 this cannon looks longer
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:09 the problem is
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:13 they dont say its a gustav cannon
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:17 they say the cannon was based on the gustav
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:23 it uses 800mm shells, different model
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:37 and plus this thing has no actual documentation
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:41 so theres nothing to work with
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:47 it would be way too small then
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:56 im keeping my scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:38:07 i measured it on that photo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:38:10 and wheel size to person size
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:39:32 theres this photo with a persn
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:39:34 person
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:39:40 drawing not photo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:40:55 that has a different version too
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:40:59 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:46:26 if this thing had documentation i would scale it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:46:34 its just people making numbers up
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:03 ill make my own scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:11 97 plane crazy blocks long <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:50 close
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:03 btw how many meters is 97 plane crazy blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:33 nice
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:43 thats my new scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:47 67.9m
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:52:59 if u dont want them to work just set it to a key u never use
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:53:24 is starting to play plane crazy in 2020 considered newgen
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:53:48 wow im not a newgen and i am shit at motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:53:58 well im getting better
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:54:17 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:54:37 angle lock at front, white section will be angle locked too
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:54:40 also piston lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:18:37 thank
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:21:09 <@723419054114865202> look at man in picture
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:21:53 its roscale im telling you
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:21:56 why is everyone doubting me
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:22:32 theres 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:22:35 oh yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:22:41 herrison noir and herrison vert
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:22:56 ur right
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:23:00 and ur other alts
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 16:42:53 no interior for obvious reasons
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:10:26 <@877391100137070625> i just realised i have a small problem
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:10:43 so the motorlocks are so tall that the upper half might not fit in
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:11:12 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:11:19 pillar is max height
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:11:39 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:11:50 2 thick side panels are angle locked same for the center one
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:11:59 2 things behind it are to cover up the hole
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:12:17 
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:12:26 white bit will be to cover up another hole
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:12:29 but i can change it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:12:40 so that the motorlocks will only be as tall as the 2 things at the back
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:13:11 ignore jesus
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:13:29 idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:13:48 i could fix it by just lowering the whole thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:13:58 but i fine tuned the piston lock for the front bits
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:00 itll be a pain
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:23 alr ill just bring the whoooooooole thing down
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:31 for fucks sake
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:35 it took me so long
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:40 to make the angle locks so precise
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:43 and everything
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:14:52 i will fix it quickly tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:15:01 i just need to recalibrate everything
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:22:36 i wont even save much space
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:22:48 since i need to use space for angle lock

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:58:07 <@877391100137070625> instead of moving the angle lock parts, ill move the parts that arent angled lower and to the side and then lock them in their original spot using standard motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:58:14 ill do it when i start making the 2nd half

general 2022-06-23 10:37:09 nah man it says theyre real
general 2022-06-23 10:37:15 it says it right there
general 2022-06-23 10:37:52 cuz i dont want fat legs
general 2022-06-23 10:37:59 and the design i made doesnt turn downwards enough
general 2022-06-23 10:38:09 cuz i want them to fold in like in this picture
general 2022-06-23 10:38:26 but tbh they look strange
general 2022-06-23 10:39:09 ill still include the ladder at the front
general 2022-06-23 10:40:07 apparently they were there to prevent the treads from shattering
general 2022-06-23 10:40:13 cuz gun big haha
general 2022-06-23 10:40:17 when shooty = big shatter
general 2022-06-23 10:40:30 but my plane crazy thick tracks will resist
general 2022-06-23 10:40:46 like the Karl Gerat, the thing was probably transported on rail
general 2022-06-23 10:40:48 then assembled
general 2022-06-23 10:40:58 the tracks were for adjustments
general 2022-06-23 10:41:01 as in
general 2022-06-23 10:41:05 if target is to the left
general 2022-06-23 10:41:16 then they turn left using the treads
general 2022-06-23 10:41:31 the karl gerat did not need legs for some reason
general 2022-06-23 10:41:38 even tho some versions had a 600mm mortar

plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:33:21 can vipempire make a gif for camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:33:31 o bruh
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:24 piston lock is pretty reliable
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:33 well when the pistons are in a good mood
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:58 no it isnt
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:19 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-roblox-motor-lock-motor-gif-20510339
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:31 is this complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:42 its not intended
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:52 intended is not the same as the community begging for it to not be removed
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:07 i think instead of motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:12 theyre gonna make different grid settings
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:17 so u can phase blocks into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:21 so motorlock is useless
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:28 well
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:33 yeah different grid settings
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:40 so u can make many angles
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:03 grid for angle lock and block phasing
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:16 hence
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:16 ur gonna get pooped on if u dont use it much
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:20 i use it now
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:37 motorlock unlocks many new design features
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:49 due to its ability to phase blocks into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:38:57 babft sucks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:13 theres like no grid in babft
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:23 makes placing blocks hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:32 how
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:41 the motors are in that tower to save space
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:47 because when motors are arranged like that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:54 they can pull in blocks further
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:56 and also
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:05 save space
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:18 but i usually dont use towers like that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:21 i really should
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:27 yes i am in the middle of understanding
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:35 with 35 days play time
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:39 i never really invested much time
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:43 into motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:48 wait wait
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:54 planes are built on a motorlock tower?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:03 i thought you build the main bit
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:09 then have a motorlock tower running through the back
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:14 and then have parts branch off
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:21 i never really built much planes
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:31 but i plan to make a biplane
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:32 or triplane
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:35 its my dream
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:40 and to have a torpedo at the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:55 but right now im building 2 thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:41:56 things
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:10 gramophone and a p1500 monster
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:17 lost interest in the latter because its so big
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:22 and cuz its boring to build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:33 gramophone is more interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:44 are planes fast to build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:55 at first i thought it would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:17 alr im gonna try make a biplane rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:43 so exposed motor 2s on the wings is a big nono?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:44 and the tail
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:13 but how will it work if its inside a block

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:19 💀💀💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:34 how is it so bad
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:47 maybe motorlock wasn't popular yet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:18 they're rather slack
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:30 oh nvm
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:36 i can see the tension
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:48 u extend treads with pistons?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:19:17 that's not a good way to do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:19:40 motorlock to pull the front and rear wheels or motorlock in the tread
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:19:45 is how i do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:18 yeah but sometimes u can't rely on pistons
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:05 make a ground build covered in cutters or spinning sections of cutters
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:16 https://media.tenor.com/images/6cf32aeabc8d41ba7a1956780245f518/tenor.gif

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:22:01 yes it is false
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:22:59 i made a worse thing that that
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:23:28 it was shitty car that was uneven and was covered in cutters
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:23:38 looked like a spider web honestly
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:23:54 it had spinning sections of cutters
general 2022-07-02 09:24:28 that a watermelon tho 😭😭
general 2022-07-02 09:25:19 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:25:55 it started out good but as more parts branched out
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:01 i made it extremely heavy
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:10 ballast
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:23 so i rockets to make it go forward
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:46 i am 4th tier according to the people who called my builds good in vip server
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:27:05 quaileer 🤩
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:27:59 there are a ton of good builds not in hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:24 like search up the mark m wutend in the search
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:57 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:29:03 this never got in the hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:07 has anybody made a gunship yet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:14 that plane with 103mm howitzers
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:55 if u made a custom gunship that shot tnt balls
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:13 thick cannon tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:29 just make a plane with a gun mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:40 i already know a design
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:44 harmonica magazine
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:52 my own custom crappy design
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:15 u slide a magazine along with conveyors like a harmonica
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:29 until a ball gets in the chamber
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:48 well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:54 it would be effective
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:10 i have some land based ones
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:14 that shoot cutter balls
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:27 and 1 that shoots individual cutters
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:34 guns are hard to aim
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:42 my shots never hit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:47 no they bounce off
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:59 if u blacklist the person then they make a clean hole through
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:21 u can if u just blacklist everyone and shoot
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:35 cutters go through people's builds if u blacklist so u can make a nice hole
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:49 can urs reload
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:53 didn't think sooo
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:35:01 1 shot fancy design cannon that can't move
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:35:14 k

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:36:25 how
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:36:42 maybe at that speed it would penetrate
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:37:03 i never tested the speed of my projectiles
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:37:19 wow
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:07 ur gunship doesn't have a 105 mm howitzer
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:42:55 so it's suspension powered
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:42:57 and hover
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:43:59 it's a bolt

general 2022-07-05 18:02:01 
general 2022-07-05 18:02:27 flaps are useful for nothing
general 2022-07-05 18:02:35 use custom motor 2 wing panel flap
general 2022-07-05 18:02:48 flaps suck
general 2022-07-05 18:02:59 they don't let jets do barrel rolls
general 2022-07-05 18:03:12 and the controls invert sometimes
general 2022-07-05 18:03:28 they also look ugly
general 2022-07-05 18:03:38 they just invert when they feel like it
general 2022-07-05 18:03:45 even if u switch the controls
general 2022-07-05 18:03:57 realistic plane in plane crazy doesn't use flaps
general 2022-07-05 18:04:06 make a flap out of motor 2 and wing panel
general 2022-07-05 18:04:13 then motorlock to hide the motor
general 2022-07-05 18:04:33 no u didn't
general 2022-07-05 18:04:39 just use that
general 2022-07-05 18:04:46 don't use the already given flaps
general 2022-07-05 18:04:58 custom motor 2 flaps are better
general 2022-07-05 18:05:10 the control panels or whatever they're called
general 2022-07-05 18:05:47 ohh those things
general 2022-07-05 18:05:52 the brakes
general 2022-07-05 18:06:07 uhh then use a piston instead of a motor
general 2022-07-05 18:06:24 when i talked about the controls inverting i was referring to control panels

general 2022-07-05 18:07:25 yes it is
general 2022-07-05 18:07:31 when they land then turn the engine down
general 2022-07-05 18:07:39 and then they turn the flaps on
general 2022-07-05 18:07:44 to slow the plane down
general 2022-07-05 18:07:50 and then reverse thrust maybe

general 2022-07-15 12:14:48 Messor structor are harvester ants storing seeds in underground granaries. Being major seed consumers in xeric habitats they influence the vegetation by depleting and dispersing seeds (Azcarate, Peco 2003, MacMahon et al. 2000, Schlick-Steiner et al. 2005). According to Seifert (1996), Central European populations of the harvester ant genus Messor are currently considered to constitute a single species Messor structor. It has been reported that M. structor ants live mainly in polygynous colonies and could be members of unicolonial populations.

general 2022-07-15 12:51:38 Redox (reduction–oxidation, /ˈrɛdɒks/ RED-oks, /ˈriːdɒks/ REE-doks[2]) is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of substrate change.[3]

Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of a chemical or atoms within it.
Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of a chemical or atoms within it.
There are two classes of redox reactions:

electron-transfer where only one (usually) electron flows from the reducing agent to the oxidant. This type of redox reaction is often discussed in term of redox couples and electrode potentials.
atom transfer, where an atom transfers from one substrate to another. For example, in the rusting of iron, the oxidation state of iron atoms increases as it converts to an oxide and simultaneously the oxidation state of oxygen decreases as it accepts electrons released by iron. Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides, other chemical species can serve the same function.[4] In hydrogenation, C=C (and other) bonds are reduced by transfer of hydrogen atoms

general 2022-07-18 22:23:35 the place it teleports u to is crosswoods 2.a
general 2022-07-18 22:23:50 apparently when you join
general 2022-07-18 22:23:58 it shows a loading screen and then it kicks you
general 2022-07-18 22:24:05 ikr
general 2022-07-18 22:24:16 they employ people from india
general 2022-07-18 22:24:59 you think
general 2022-07-18 22:25:15 adopt me has a measly 157k
general 2022-07-18 22:25:21 bloxburg has 120k wow
general 2022-07-18 22:25:25 more than usual
general 2022-07-18 22:25:35 brookhaven has 453k
general 2022-07-18 22:25:37 same
general 2022-07-18 22:25:48 undes just dont watch greenlegocats123 or use twitter
general 2022-07-18 22:25:55 i get my roblox news from greenlegocats123
general 2022-07-18 22:26:00 and roblox drama
general 2022-07-18 22:26:09 i dont watch kreekcraft
general 2022-07-18 22:26:11 but yes he did
general 2022-07-18 22:26:29 i dont use twitter
general 2022-07-18 22:26:33 they can
general 2022-07-18 22:26:43 they just dont care
general 2022-07-18 22:26:51 or just dont have access to information
general 2022-07-18 22:26:59 because roblox is doing such a great job
general 2022-07-18 22:27:03 at informing people
general 2022-07-18 22:27:36 its incredible how theyre doing nothing so far
general 2022-07-18 22:28:16 this exploit has apparently been around for a while
general 2022-07-18 22:28:17 dormant
general 2022-07-18 22:28:23 now someone is using it
general 2022-07-18 22:28:49 its also incredible how many people are getting banned

general 2022-07-18 22:29:40 they just care about money and investors now
general 2022-07-18 22:29:42 not the players
general 2022-07-18 22:29:45 no more egg hunt
general 2022-07-18 22:29:47 no nothing
general 2022-07-18 22:29:56 just shitty events, rthro and no bloxy awards
general 2022-07-18 22:30:00 now theres innovation awards
general 2022-07-18 22:30:20 removing the ability to show roblox content using r6 and r15 (idk where this counts)
general 2022-07-18 22:31:20 according to greenlegocats
general 2022-07-18 22:31:25 i dont remember
general 2022-07-18 22:31:31 what it exactly was
general 2022-07-18 22:31:39 but i think he said that investors are starting to notice how faulty roblox is
general 2022-07-18 22:32:02 or something like thart
general 2022-07-18 22:32:04 that
general 2022-07-18 22:32:16 roblox is gonna turn into that 1 black mirror episode
general 2022-07-18 22:32:26 hmm which one tho
general 2022-07-18 22:32:41 dont remember any metaverse things in black mirror
general 2022-07-18 22:32:54 i was gonna say where the guy lives in the room with nothing and has ads all the time on his tv
general 2022-07-18 22:33:10 its gonna turn into uhh
general 2022-07-18 22:33:24 yeah just a cash grab
general 2022-07-18 22:33:51 idk

general 2022-11-03 10:41:34 from our apple tree
general 2022-11-03 10:41:45 4 fell and 1 was bad
general 2022-11-03 10:41:51 so we lost 5 potential apples
general 2022-11-03 10:41:57 they're nice and sweet
general 2022-11-03 10:42:08 they've been growing since spring
general 2022-11-03 10:44:00 there were 5 more
general 2022-11-03 10:44:06 those are all the good ones
general 2022-11-03 10:44:14 they're nice and sweet
general 2022-11-03 10:44:42 huh

general 2022-11-03 10:47:59 the 5 bad apples had holes in them
general 2022-11-03 10:48:04 and bugs in them
general 2022-11-03 10:48:31 Black spots are typical for apples that u don't get in the shops, they don't affect the flavour
general 2022-11-03 10:49:33 yes
general 2022-11-03 10:49:39 i dont blame him
general 2022-11-03 10:49:53 it protects the sweet goods and seeds from the elements
general 2022-11-03 10:50:05 the goal of the apple is to get eaten
general 2022-11-03 10:50:24 so that the seeds get pooped out somewhere else
general 2022-11-03 10:50:28 free fertiliser
general 2022-11-03 10:50:47 yes
general 2022-11-03 10:50:55 apple armor
general 2022-11-03 10:51:14 it doesn't let bacteria get in
general 2022-11-03 10:51:21 that will rot the apple

general 2023-02-17 14:39:06 😎
general 2023-02-17 14:39:23 it not eating
general 2023-02-17 14:39:31 those are eggs
general 2023-02-17 14:39:43 it eggs
general 2023-02-17 14:39:57 shush

general 2023-02-17 14:40:09 
general 2023-02-17 14:40:16 ant colony
general 2023-02-17 14:40:29 started from single queen
general 2023-02-17 14:40:36 those worms are their kids
general 2023-02-17 14:40:38 larvae
general 2023-02-17 14:40:41 caterpillars
general 2023-02-17 14:40:47 no
general 2023-02-17 14:41:06 the eggs turn into worms
general 2023-02-17 14:41:12 maggots
general 2023-02-17 14:41:19 they eat protein
general 2023-02-17 14:41:28 it is cruel to do that to ur pets
general 2023-02-17 14:42:11 it takes a long time to grow the colony up to a large size
general 2023-02-17 14:42:27 few years
general 2023-02-17 14:42:46 it is more entertaining to watch the ants hunt prey
general 2023-02-17 14:42:55 that way u keep ur colony and don't risk losing it
general 2023-02-17 14:43:07 he keeps solenopsis
general 2023-02-17 14:43:12 fire ants
general 2023-02-17 14:43:26 gladly
general 2023-02-17 14:43:47 my ant colony is roughly 20 workers
general 2023-02-17 14:43:56 i have 2 queens starting out
general 2023-02-17 14:43:59 and another colony
general 2023-02-17 14:44:06 yes
general 2023-02-17 14:44:16 they are native to South America
general 2023-02-17 14:44:42 my colony is too small for that
general 2023-02-17 14:44:46 i can put in small flies
general 2023-02-17 14:45:00 i gave them small baby mealworms alive
general 2023-02-17 14:45:07 they would pin it down and exhaust it
general 2023-02-17 14:45:14 no casualties
general 2023-02-17 14:45:40 
general 2023-02-17 14:45:44 this is the same colony in august
general 2023-02-17 14:45:50 the workers are only eggs
general 2023-02-17 14:45:58 and the queen is alone
general 2023-02-17 14:46:10 no
general 2023-02-17 14:46:14 i have harvester ants
general 2023-02-17 14:46:23 i have 4 species
general 2023-02-17 14:46:27 one of which are harvester ants
general 2023-02-17 14:46:45 i keep colonies with queens
general 2023-02-17 14:46:55 i got the queen early this morning
general 2023-02-17 14:47:01 messor barbarus
general 2023-02-17 14:47:06 
general 2023-02-17 14:47:26 in roughly 1 month she will get her first workers
general 2023-02-17 14:47:33 the other 3 are native to my country
general 2023-02-17 14:47:55 whatttt
general 2023-02-17 14:48:14 youre like their god
general 2023-02-17 14:48:26 i didn't delete anything
general 2023-02-17 14:48:40 lasius [cannot say this part]
general 2023-02-17 14:48:44 lasius flavus
general 2023-02-17 14:48:47 formica lemani
general 2023-02-17 14:48:56 First one is this
general 2023-02-17 14:49:26 2nd one is this
general 2023-02-17 14:49:36 flavus in the species name meaning yellow
general 2023-02-17 14:49:47 ireland
general 2023-02-17 14:50:30 formica lemani
general 2023-02-17 14:50:41 ever since i moved them the queen ceased laying eggs
general 2023-02-17 14:51:32 a popular container to keep ants in are test tubes
general 2023-02-17 14:52:10 large batch of eggs on the ceiling
general 2023-02-17 14:52:59 what
general 2023-02-17 14:53:17 many pupae - like what butterflies have
general 2023-02-17 14:53:30 the hell is an ant tower
general 2023-02-17 14:53:49 pffff
general 2023-02-17 14:54:06 i will just add another tube and give them a place to look for food
general 2023-02-17 14:54:24 then i will move them into some silly acrylic nest i have
general 2023-02-17 14:54:30 no more eggs
general 2023-02-17 14:54:33 no new ants
general 2023-02-17 14:54:47 one of my ant colony's queens for no reason recently
general 2023-02-17 14:54:50 harvester ants
general 2023-02-17 14:54:54 messor barbarus
general 2023-02-17 14:54:58 the same
general 2023-02-17 14:55:18 that's why i got a new queen and i will start a new colony of them
general 2023-02-17 14:55:32 no it takes a lot of effort to grow an ant colony
general 2023-02-17 14:55:46 they work for their brood (the ant babies)
general 2023-02-17 14:55:59 ants from foreign colonies will kill eachother
general 2023-02-17 14:56:21 so u have to dig up a colony which is bad for the ecosystem or grow out a colony
general 2023-02-17 14:56:29 no
general 2023-02-17 14:57:02 i will give my new harvester ant queen some rest after being in shipping
general 2023-02-17 14:57:26 not online
general 2023-02-17 14:57:30 there are many websites tho
general 2023-02-17 14:57:34 do you live in europe
general 2023-02-17 14:57:53 there are private sellers and websites
general 2023-02-17 14:58:00 u can't breed ants in captivity
general 2023-02-17 14:58:18 queens must be caught from the massive flights they have in the wild
general 2023-02-17 14:58:36 define breeding for me
general 2023-02-17 14:59:09 yes but you don't "breed" them
general 2023-02-17 14:59:29 in the wild, mature colonies produce alates - ants that reproduce
general 2023-02-17 14:59:41 male and female ants from many nests swarm together
general 2023-02-17 14:59:46 and fly into the sky
general 2023-02-17 15:00:09 the males die after, and queens take their wings off and search for a place to start a colony
general 2023-02-17 15:00:22 yes step on fire ant mounds
general 2023-02-17 15:00:40 no u can't fuking breed ants
general 2023-02-17 15:00:58 you can't
general 2023-02-17 15:01:02 people tried to do that
general 2023-02-17 15:01:04 it doesn't work
general 2023-02-17 15:01:17 u can't force reproductive ants to do that
general 2023-02-17 15:01:25 do you keep ants
general 2023-02-17 15:02:01 bro thousands of people keep ants
general 2023-02-17 15:02:07 u think people haven't tried
general 2023-02-17 15:02:19 in the wild they wait for favorable conditions to fly out
general 2023-02-17 15:02:51 https://youtu.be/IGJ2jMZ-gaI
general 2023-02-17 15:03:01 this is good for the environment
general 2023-02-17 15:03:10 fire ants are shit for the environment
general 2023-02-17 15:03:17 they're invasive
general 2023-02-17 15:03:30 Who?
general 2023-02-17 15:03:51 fucking idiot
general 2023-02-17 15:04:17 only species like tetramorium bicarinatum inbreed
general 2023-02-17 15:04:21 indeed
general 2023-02-17 15:04:25 with wings
general 2023-02-17 15:04:28 they do
general 2023-02-17 15:05:05 https://youtu.be/wfqcNe35z6g
general 2023-02-17 15:05:13 the queens have wings
general 2023-02-17 15:05:18 then they take them off
general 2023-02-17 15:05:23 you can't
general 2023-02-17 15:05:34 and you don't need to
general 2023-02-17 15:05:43 in the summer people collect those wingless queens
general 2023-02-17 15:05:47 that's what i did
general 2023-02-17 15:06:06 on my driveway i spotted the queen of this colony
general 2023-02-17 15:06:56 they can who told u they can't
general 2023-02-17 15:07:11 all ant colonies generate male ants from unfertilised eggs
general 2023-02-17 15:07:20 male ants have wings
general 2023-02-17 15:07:34 ur trolling
general 2023-02-17 15:07:41 that's what i meant by King
general 2023-02-17 15:07:46 King ant =male ant
general 2023-02-17 15:07:52 they mate with foreign queens from other nests
general 2023-02-17 15:08:03 in nuptial flights
general 2023-02-17 15:08:09 shhh
general 2023-02-17 15:08:20 not with the queen
general 2023-02-17 15:10:34 in mature ant colonies, queens lay unfertilised eggs and fertilised eggs which instead of turning into workers turn into queen alates, which have wings
on hot humid days in the summer, ant colonies from many nests in an area have a nuptial flight - an event when these queen alates and male ants swarm together and mate with other ants from other nests in the sky
after mating, the male fulfills his only purpose in life and dies, but the queens land and take off their wings and find a suitable spot to dig and establish a colony of its own
general 2023-02-17 15:11:08 <@743842049157234759>
general 2023-02-17 15:12:16 bro like u know shit
general 2023-02-17 15:12:20 u don't even keep ants
general 2023-02-17 15:12:33 people have tried various methods
general 2023-02-17 15:12:35 and failed
general 2023-02-17 15:12:42 some ants do that
general 2023-02-17 15:13:09 the species tetramorium bicarnatum inbreeds and parts of the colony split off
general 2023-02-17 15:13:30 well it would take a lot of effort and it's easier to just collect them
general 2023-02-17 15:15:13 in the summer
general 2023-02-17 15:15:20 they make alates in the summer
general 2023-02-17 15:15:26 so it's easier to just collect them
general 2023-02-17 15:15:49 let me ask my good friend mettocollsuss
general 2023-02-17 15:16:21 
general 2023-02-17 15:16:49 he is experienced trust me
general 2023-02-17 15:17:05 i am in an antkeeping discord server that has pretty experienced keepers
general 2023-02-17 15:17:15 Source: Google contradicts you
general 2023-02-17 15:17:59 
general 2023-02-17 15:18:28 swarm
general 2023-02-17 15:18:38 
general 2023-02-17 15:18:49 Show me your source then
general 2023-02-17 15:18:56 fuking tetramorium bicarnatum can
general 2023-02-17 15:19:12 but not something like campo penn
general 2023-02-17 15:19:16 Yes
general 2023-02-17 15:19:18 yes yes
general 2023-02-17 15:19:46 everywhere says no
general 2023-02-17 15:20:09 ur just trolling mate
general 2023-02-17 15:20:50 everywhere only says a few species
general 2023-02-17 15:21:04 like tetramorium bicarinatum
general 2023-02-17 15:21:11 that inbreed
general 2023-02-17 15:21:18 u said use a fucking net
general 2023-02-17 15:21:31 for ants that need to fly
general 2023-02-17 15:22:00 it's hard to start a breeding program cuz u have to do it once a year when they also do it
general 2023-02-17 15:22:08 so there's no point
general 2023-02-17 15:22:14 cuz they will do it naturally
general 2023-02-17 15:22:33 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/989847499973992571/997979312328294493/attachment.gif
general 2023-02-17 15:23:10 you will have to do that anyways to find queen alates and male alate callows or pupae
general 2023-02-17 15:23:20 Read the paragraph I said
general 2023-02-17 15:23:35 Queen alates and male alates fly from mature colonies with a queen
general 2023-02-17 15:23:37 and then bang
general 2023-02-17 15:23:42 And then queens land and find a spot to dig
general 2023-02-17 15:24:01 The queen alates and male alates are produced by the queen
general 2023-02-17 15:24:10 cephalotes species
general 2023-02-17 15:24:27 they use those heads to block off entrances
general 2023-02-17 15:24:28 yes
general 2023-02-17 15:24:47 <@651361636657135617> show me some of ur colonies
general 2023-02-17 15:25:01 u have an ant room right
general 2023-02-17 15:26:17 so you don't actually keep ants
general 2023-02-17 15:26:29 and you act like you know the people who tried
general 2023-02-17 15:27:05 yes you know me
general 2023-02-17 15:27:40 and then u gaslit me and said u can't do it for all species even tho that's what i was saying

general 2023-02-17 15:28:15 no he is a commoner in disguise
general 2023-02-17 15:28:32 you said just use a net

general 2023-04-13 08:42:57 Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food, typically to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and to allow for growth. Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. For humans, eating is an activity of daily living. Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to hunger or famine, as part of a diet or as religious fasting.

general 2023-04-13 08:46:16 Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals.

Most animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. Water is required for many physiological processes. Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems.

Methods of drinking

In humans

When a liquid enters a human mouth, the swallowing process is completed by peristalsis which delivers the liquid through the esophagus to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or drinkware may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be performed by acts of inhalation, typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. Infants employ a method of suction wherein the lips are pressed tight around a source, as in breastfeeding: a combination of breath and tongue movement creates a vacuum which draws in liquid.[1]

In other land mammals

By necessity, terrestrial animals in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food,[2] and learn to actively seek foods with high fluid content.[3] When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.[4]

general 2023-06-18 20:03:40 Ireland
general 2023-06-18 20:03:50 We don't have bass and bluegill
general 2023-06-18 20:03:55 and sunfish
general 2023-06-18 20:04:21 Oh in Canada
general 2023-06-18 20:04:33 I always think of America when i hear bass
general 2023-06-18 20:04:56 In my area there's not much in the canal closer to my house
general 2023-06-18 20:05:04 but if u go down 1.3km there's a bridge
general 2023-06-18 20:05:17 
general 2023-06-18 20:05:18 this bridge
general 2023-06-18 20:05:39 And in the canal there's sometimes fish
general 2023-06-18 20:05:59 but there's a canal further away from my house in the opposite direction that has a lot of good fish
general 2023-06-18 20:06:30 I only catch small roach
general 2023-06-18 20:06:48 I want to catch a bream or tench but the canal in my place is so shit and I don't have the stuff to ledger fish
general 2023-06-18 20:07:14 I caught those fat slabs on 2 maggots on a size 16 hook 🤣🤣🤣
general 2023-06-18 20:07:20 I was targeting roach
general 2023-06-18 20:07:33 I got tiny roach along with those good perch
general 2023-06-18 20:07:56 We haven't got much carp in ireland
general 2023-06-18 20:08:08 I want to get stuff for ledger fishing to catch a big canal fish
general 2023-06-18 20:08:29 I have shit luck with pike
general 2023-06-18 20:08:37 So i float fish for coarse fish
general 2023-06-18 20:08:45 The pikes here are nice
general 2023-06-18 20:08:49 Northern pike
general 2023-06-18 20:08:53 Not whatever chain pickerel is
general 2023-06-18 20:09:25 I have a few rigs for pelagic fish but i haven't tried sea fishing yet
general 2023-06-18 20:09:36 Mostly I catch dinky roach and alright perch
general 2023-06-18 20:09:48 I only caught my first canal fishes a few days ago
general 2023-06-18 20:09:55 Before that I only caught fish in lakes
general 2023-06-18 20:10:11 Damn
general 2023-06-18 20:11:08 my first 3 canal fish
general 2023-06-18 20:11:13 Just some dinky roach

general 2023-06-18 20:11:34 Those are tiny af for roach
general 2023-06-18 20:12:17 but yeah by that bridge i showed u there's a few small lakes left over from the quarry they used to build the bridge 300 years ago
general 2023-06-18 20:12:31 In those lakes there's a good few roach and rudd
general 2023-06-18 20:12:37 The lakes are small
general 2023-06-18 20:12:57 But we are gonna try catch fish in the canal and transfer them all into one lake
general 2023-06-18 20:13:16 Oh yeah breams are slimey
general 2023-06-18 20:13:21 I've caught only one bream before
general 2023-06-18 20:13:30 Size 10 hook with a fuck ton of maggots
general 2023-06-18 20:13:33 Float fishing
general 2023-06-18 20:14:05 I have my float and weights always ready
general 2023-06-18 20:14:14 I never take them off the line
general 2023-06-18 20:14:19 And i use lead split shot
general 2023-06-18 20:14:25 That I slide up and down the line
general 2023-06-18 20:14:46 They stay put but with enough force I can slide em
general 2023-06-18 20:15:47 Oh yeah same I can cast far with my float if i need to
general 2023-06-18 20:16:00 I like float fishing the most cuz i can actually catch shit
general 2023-06-18 20:16:12 I have terrible luck with lures
general 2023-06-18 20:16:21 Never caught a fish on a lure yet
general 2023-06-18 20:16:32 I only started fishing in September
general 2023-06-18 20:16:34 I use maggots too
general 2023-06-18 20:16:40 But I've learned a lot
general 2023-06-18 20:16:47 i use worms if i forget maggots
general 2023-06-18 20:16:54 Maggots leave a smell on my hand
general 2023-06-18 20:17:16 And now 2 of my friends bought rods recently
general 2023-06-18 20:17:35 And i teach them as my friend taught me
general 2023-06-18 20:17:43 rip
general 2023-06-18 20:18:02 Feels nice to pass on the advice I've learned
general 2023-06-18 20:18:18 pray to gaijin snail 5 times a day
general 2023-06-18 20:18:29 did you miss your prayers ⁉️
general 2023-06-18 20:18:56 i found fishing interesting myself
general 2023-06-18 20:19:17 and it was a coincidence that my friend who I don't see often was really good at fishing
general 2023-06-18 20:19:36 I go through phases like that too sometimes with other hobbies like gaming
general 2023-06-18 20:19:44 like with roblox
general 2023-06-18 20:19:51 I haven't played roblox in months now
general 2023-06-18 20:19:57 But fishing is different

general 2023-07-14 14:04:38 like 70-80 workers
general 2023-07-14 14:04:47 that's not a lot
general 2023-07-14 14:05:00 test tube most efficient and best way to house ants
general 2023-07-14 14:05:21 because the queens need minimal vibration and water when starting a colony
general 2023-07-14 14:05:34 you can fill half a tube with water and push cotton till the other side of the cotton gets wet
general 2023-07-14 14:05:43 and put the queen in and close off the other side
general 2023-07-14 14:05:48 u don't have to refill the water
general 2023-07-14 14:05:56 not until a few months after
general 2023-07-14 14:06:10 nest
general 2023-07-14 14:06:22 many options for material

general 2023-07-14 14:06:57 for wood nesting ants
general 2023-07-14 14:07:07 yes
general 2023-07-14 14:07:16 those ones are very overpriced
general 2023-07-14 14:07:50 a nest like this is cheap
