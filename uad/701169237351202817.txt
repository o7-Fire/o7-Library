plane-crazy 2021-01-20 18:49:59 Smol topedo boat I made a while ago.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:55:39 For which part?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:57:44 I have some suspesnion here, the tracks are someone elses though.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:58:17 oh right, I cant use pictures.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:58:35 The issue isn't physics, just lag.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:58:55 Unfortunatly i cant add images here.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:59:00 I used to be able to but...
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:59:35 Oh, yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:00:10 What do I have to do to be able to add images again?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:00:42 Um, how long does that take again?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:01:08 is it just timed or something?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:01:43 What type is it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:02:24 No, I mean like torsion bars or christie, stuff like that.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:03:01 Bruh.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:03:10 How do you not know suspnsions types?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:03:36 Hmm, can you take a picture of the suspension without the wheels, just so we can see the appearance of it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:03:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 20:15:10 Bold of you to assume it ever worked.
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 21:40:12 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 21:44:39 Oh thats cool.
general 2021-02-12 21:58:04 Look at that atrocity

general 2021-09-18 16:28:22 Damn it CFK you deleted an important channel again.
general 2021-09-18 16:28:51 No no no
general 2021-09-18 16:28:52 Cfk
general 2021-09-18 16:28:57 You wouldn't get the joke
general 2021-09-18 16:29:07 You are not a part of tanmk.
general 2021-09-18 16:29:21 Ok
general 2021-09-18 16:29:26 So this server owner cfk
general 2021-09-18 16:29:30 Tried to duplicate general chat
general 2021-09-18 16:29:44 but ended up accidentally deleting it
general 2021-09-18 16:30:06 So every time someone deletes a major channel, we say it got Cfk'd or Dailyangelo'd.
general 2021-09-18 16:31:20 Wdym?
general 2021-09-18 16:31:30 Yeh what about it
general 2021-09-18 16:35:38 my pc is not crappy
general 2021-09-18 16:35:41 it's my airfoil i think
general 2021-09-18 16:38:13 Are planes supposed to go awol when you break 1000 if you're using hover drives
general 2021-09-18 16:38:24 Or is my design just wonky
general 2021-09-18 16:38:52 Like it starts yawing from side to side until it does it so much that I lose all elevator and rudder control
general 2021-09-18 16:39:08 But only at around 800-1000
general 2021-09-18 16:39:18 Ah good
general 2021-09-18 16:39:28 So it's not just my very poor aircraft design
general 2021-09-18 16:39:36 Uh is this enough lemme get a picture
general 2021-09-18 16:40:31 It's a desktop
general 2021-09-18 16:40:34 And it runs fine.
general 2021-09-18 16:40:52 Laughs in I7
general 2021-09-18 16:41:35 Ghz?
general 2021-09-18 16:42:19 Which is?
general 2021-09-18 16:42:54 Bruh
general 2021-09-18 16:43:28 I just hit 2000 before it shook with minor mods
general 2021-09-18 16:43:31 bitch
general 2021-09-18 16:44:12 sweating computer
general 2021-09-18 16:45:50 My plane is massive because I wanted to make a version with a bomb bay
general 2021-09-18 16:45:54 A very large bomb bay
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:11:00 Some random bomber I came up with.
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:11:14 And unlike what blu says it isn’t an il-28
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:18:26 Looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:25:43 I accidentally made a really well built airframe.
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:25:48 Did some combat.
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:25:59 Absorbed like 20 missiles
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:26:19 And I haven’t added propellers or better control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:26:28 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:27:09 I only died when I entered a flat spin from him shooting off my other wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 21:36:30 A thing i made. Sorta loosely based on an Arado and a Tu-14
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 21:36:39 As much as blu wants to say it it is not an il-28
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 12:45:27 Trck
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 18:58:38 I feel like I should attempt to make a massive torpedo and just strap it under a bomber
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 18:58:45 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 18:58:47 Lemme go do that
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 20:36:04 Any tips on torpedoes?
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 20:36:37 oh]
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 20:36:41 roger
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:44:12 Anyone know of any way to stop motor 2 nosegear from collapsing on takeoff?
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:45:06 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:45:09 both
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:45:13 lemme try changing it
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:45:40 Didn't work
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:46:11 yes but
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 17:46:26 Motor 2's let me turn my entire retraction process into only 1 button
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 19:53:29 is anyone else having issues with custom landing gear?
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 19:53:41 it's glitching out now when it worked fine for a month
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:55:39 I use a mac and big planes dont lag me too badly.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:55:46 Unless I use hover drives then I recieve tomfuckery
