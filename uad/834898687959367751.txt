plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:16:20 Ayo still going on about the shredders bro üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:17:04 As I e said before
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:17:19 I remove my blocks after 3-4 hours to keep it clean
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:17:33 That block was fine a long time ago
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:18:07 Nah bro cause I'm like a shredder user bro like what is "Science" sounds fake
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:19:19 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:20:13 They are known as bees Wich are a sub category of shredders, huge + shredders are known as X shredders and owned and used by obl
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:21:38 The small ball ones are easy but annoying to kill
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:22:06 No no I mean the mini mini Omni bugs
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:22:41 Like the small ones that go in swarms and are a general annoyance sometimes and that comes from a pro shredder user
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:23:04 Some shredders are downright annoying
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:23:10 No
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:23:20 It's called an Omni bug
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:23:22 Bet small
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:23:46 It's like a bee but 2 extra arms flys better and shoots bullet hell
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:24:36 Ye the Omni bugs don't do melee mostly
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:24:41 They shoot bullet hell
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:25:03 Shredder Omni bugs are ez to kill
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:25:16 Cause they lack range
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:25:50 Stuk
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:26:11 So you think shredders are dead nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:26:17 I would agree mostly
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:26:34 As the og bugs on I bugs and sphere bugs can all be avoided or killed
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:27:11 But there is a special type of Omni bug called an Omni sphere Wich is SUPER deadly and there is a titan varient of it
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:27:58 That's 1 of them but very slow blades
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:28:24 Obl rn though makes those Titans go at 15k speed fast spinning blades and make em waterproof
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:29:04 Outdated, imagine this but with faster blades bullet hell and 15k speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:29:42 That is the current Omni sphere titan
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:29:56 Stuk
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:30:10 I would love to tell you about a new species I'm designing
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:30:14 But it's top secret
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:30:28 Also I never quit shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:30:29 Btw
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:31:14 If you knew about it's existance you would prob spread awareness and cause problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:31:43 For obl
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:32:07 But I'll give you a short hint in dms
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:32:32 You cannot counter this one
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:32:37 Dms
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:34:28 So sad
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:34:42 Its almost like I already found a fix to that
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:35:07 Cutters wont do damage at 2k if both objects are going the same direction
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:35:25 If both objects collide into eachother it still does damage
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 06:36:51 Problem though If the Omni sphere has a 360 degree turn angle that experiences no inertia

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:56:49 Well
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:56:57 It depends on the context
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:57:49 Was it using super rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:58:11 Use regular rocket engines instead then
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:59:00 I don't know how much slower you want it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:59:08 Like a little or a lot slower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 07:59:51 Replace half of the super rocket engines with normal rocket engines

the-dump 2022-02-22 06:51:10 It just became a really popular thing out of nowhere
the-dump 2022-02-22 06:51:58 
the-dump 2022-02-22 06:53:36 Lean is¬†an illicit substance made with Codeine cough syrup, soda, and hard candy. Codeine is derived from the Opium poppy plant (similar to Morphine) and is one of the weaker Opioids. However, it's still highly addictive and potentially damaging to the body.

the-dump 2022-04-11 06:49:25 
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:50:42 There are no rules againsted it, plus I paid for it and turned it into an mp4 meaning it's only illegal if YOU download it
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:51:42 Still payed for it
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:51:45 Not piracy

the-dump 2022-04-11 06:54:12 I mean there is another law stating no distribution
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:54:34 But where I live, all you have to do is add a thing saying don't distribute
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:54:52 Sooo I guess I'll just add a don't distribute or download to it
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:55:07 Then if they illegally download it

the-dump 2022-04-11 06:56:32 I stated that was a different law
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:56:41 Meaning there where 2 laws
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:56:50 1, no piracy
the-dump 2022-04-11 06:57:09 2, warning about not distributing

plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:20:49 
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:21:43 niceee
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:21:51 who are you again
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:22:27 also i dont mainly use shredders, i use them to abuse a glitch called axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:22:35 very funny glitch
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:22:46 yeah more like irl knives
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:22:52 more force = more damage
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:23:03 something DSG would help very much with
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:23:32 you have 3 axis in every one of your build, if you forcefully remove one through glitches you delete their entire build
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:23:34 no pvp needed
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:23:37 just tap and their gone
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:24:09 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:24:16 its a roblox glitch so rickje cant patch it in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:24:22 meaning shredders dont even need to use cutters
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:24:25 just use axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:24:35 mf i aint giving away the tech
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:17 "the" tech
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:20 new tech discovered
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:23 i call it the
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:28 it does the
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:44 no
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:25:46 ‚òï
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:26:06 hey as long as it works
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:26:15 just keep trying and learning how to design
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:26:59 id go a bit thicker but otherwise good length
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:27:30 yeah im thinking like a singular block thicker
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:27:32 would look nice
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:27:50 alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:01 huh
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:05 then try a half block? idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:32 also
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:41 the SRB's usually have a top cone
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:48 that helps with the stubby
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:29:49 problem
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:30:09 i can see that
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:30:47 alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:31:12 just remember our opinions shouldn't get in the way of what you think is good
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 00:31:23 as long as its visually pleasing to you, other people's opinions don't matter

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:42:31 If he wants to leak server ruining tech may as well leak who he really is
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:42:51 He was in this group
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:43:13 Was
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:43:20 He left the server
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:43:31 As soon as the Convo happened earlier
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:43:57 I may be a shredder but I ain't a person who wants the servers to shit themselves
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:44:36 Yeah it's my group, CSA
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:44:43 All of our elites know how to do it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:44:56 +2 other ppl
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:45:00 A random guy with a jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:45:12 And the creator of the tech, eit
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:45:22 Or I refer to him as PCA-001
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:46:59 Let's just say this video pisses me off with how inaccurate sone parts are and how little info it actually has
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:47:02 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGzO3iB4sQc&t=3s
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:47:43 He also forgot to mention i helped exilir8 by creating the idea of a missile with cutters
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:48:02 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:48:33 I had the idea I told him about it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:48:37 He made it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:48:44 And made a tut
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:49:50 To be fair there is a difference between tutorial shredders are people who do it for the fun of making shrefs
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:49:57 As I can put all this cool tech on a jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:50:03 And it would do the same stuff
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:50:26 Ay I remember you, you used to be a part of jannus old group OBL
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:50:41 
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:50:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:50:54 You where in the group
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:52:39 Alright then I'll ask the man, jannu himself
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:54:59 No he quit discord semi
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 07:55:06 So he takes forever to respond
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:02:29 He said he recognizes your user but is unsure if you were in his group (he fixed the joins like a month ago so we can't tell)
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:02:49 <@486232069886705665>
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:04:09 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:04:22 This was a discord server for omni bug makers
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:05:16 What month?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:06:03 Cause obl was founded in November of 2021
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:06:29 It's what this discord server shows in it's profile
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:06:54 With each engine having giant 2 blades on the end of it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:07:33 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:07:49 Well you could get into obl without a bug same with ssphericals server
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:07:58 Turns out both of them died due to lack of care
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:02 My server still up though
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:06 CSA
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:33 CSA = collective shredder alliance
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:42 Omni bugs
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:47 Are shredders but evolved
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:08:59 Custom omnis are called Omni titans
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:09:07 So
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:09:34 You know those annoying ass little black balls of cutters in servers?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:09:47 Yeah that's an Omni bug
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:09:53 Tutorial bugs are annoying as hell
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:10:03 That's why CSA is only open to custom shredders
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:10:58 I wonder who this is then
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:11:05 ü§î

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:16:19 Hello brother in Christ
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:16:30 What you know about it or something?

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:23:35 We indulge in minor amounts of messing around
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:26:02 I do love making jets and tanks and I could very well strap all my cool ass tech to that shit but I love seeing people rage that I use a shredder (narcissist activity detected)
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:26:36 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:27:03 Yeah but that is fine if it's a tutorial bug
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:27:11 Like those shits are the most toxic things ever
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:27:39 But custom bugs just trying to enjoy themselves don't need to be harassed
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:28:23 To be fair im not saying all custom bugs are peaceful, I've met plenty toxic users
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:28:28 But the vast majority aren't
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:29:41 Panzer force real
general 2022-08-28 08:30:09 Hello fellow people playground player
general 2022-08-28 08:30:38 I myself indulge in minor amounts of human destruction
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:32:14 Nice ship dude!
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:33:13 Yeah that's a question I have too
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:33:32 Ah a balancer
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:33:41 Why would you need one on a ship though
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:35:21 To be fair
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:35:27 You could just use ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:36:30 I've never met someone who needed to use a balancer to fix motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:37:28 Lol it's what I call it cuz I'm goofy
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:38:15 Tried using camera lock to fix your issue instead?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:38:37 I said have you tried
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:38:58 You didn't though
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:39:09 You just said I'm not using cam lock on it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:39:17 Grammar moment
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:39:46 No you just have bad grammar
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:40:01 You should have said no, I haven't tried using camera lock to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:40:45 Having good grammar doesn't make you a nerd it's something you have to know if you want to become a writer
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:41:10 :/
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:41:29 Mad?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:41:52 Ok then don't
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:42:54 Bacon

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:45:25 Look at that he didn't stop talking
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:45:38 Also I'm a white name cause this is my new discord account
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:45:43 My old one shat itself
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:46:21 When did I mention that you cared?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:46:30 (I didn't)
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:48:31 What face full of cringe did I just experience looking at ur profile
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:48:52 It wasn't an answer
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:49:31 It was my opinion that I have a right to say, I believe it does not matter if you have asked or not
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:50:30 Says the person who's only 3 comebacks are didn't ask, nerd and leave
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:50:52 Oh and also 4k skulls

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:53:53 üò±
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:54:48 I believe the engineer has equal amounts of IQ, he is just using them in a way that I don't quite agree with
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:55:01 We all have opinions that count
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:55:56 My tip is just experiment with what looks good, trial and error will allow you to make better builds
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:56:50 No Shame in asking others for help, if you don't quite like the game you can always find others you like
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:58:24 If I where you I would take a break from this conversation as it seems to be causing unwanted drama
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:59:08 No I was just trying to help you with your grammar, you initiated it by being toxic
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 08:59:24 I was helping you out bruh
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:00:10 I'm not mad though lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:00:25 I was just saying I didn't understand what you said because your grammar didn't make sense
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:00:37 Then I helped you out a bit
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:01:07 You initiated it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:02:18 Since when is grammar moment an initiative of an argument
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:02:21 -_-
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:02:46 Have a good night Maverick
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:02:50 Sweet dreams
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:03:10 Lol good point
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:03:24 Nerd trend was overused though
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:04:09 I wasn't a cop I was just helping you out, you where the one who took it as an insult :/
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:04:29 It is, im laughing my ass off
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 09:04:44 The reason I'm continuing is its funny as hell and I'm bored

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:41:02 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:41:33 In this photo here
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:41:37 Target exploit I believe
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:41:50 PATROL BOAT 100m
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:43:47 Ah so it's edited?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:43:54 Gotta keep searching then...
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:58:15 Lmao say that to specifix
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:58:28 He wrote a script to differentiate builds
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:58:38 Shredders, jets, boats, tanks
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:59:12 It is, you simply run it through image processing to find similarities but alright if you say so
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:59:20 :/
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:59:37 I ain't the one with the script buddy
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:59:45 You talk to specifix
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 09:59:52 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:00:31 Oh here's the "if you don't provide the example you clearly don't have, it's fake" comeback
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:00:37 :/
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:01:02 Uhuh
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:01:06 Sure

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:14:38 Was told it was edited
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:14:50 Thought he had specifix's script
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:14:53 Was mistaken
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:15:10 Not mine
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:15:36 The target script exists ingame
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:15:50 The only person I know that has it is specifix
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:16:18 Ehh it ain't really that bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:16:39 It basically just puts a target on every build and when in sight, identifies what type of build it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:17:01 Also tells you the distance
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:17:51 Specifix used the exploit in the obl vs AST war
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:18:12 It is possible though, but a con of it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:18:20 You gotta be close enough for it to identify
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:18:28 So it can make it out
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:18:42 But once identified it says what it is forever
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:19:09 Thing is if it can't identify the build or if it doesn't match anything
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:19:19 If it isn't identified it says Unknown
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:19:27 And if it can't figure out what it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:19:31 It says Custom
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:19:52 Me when he has dementor (he forgor I don have the script)
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:20:40 Crap autocorrect messed it up
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:20:43 Leme fix it
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:21:38 There fixed the message
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:21:40 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:22:26 Anyway back to your regularly scheduled programs

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:23:46 üóø
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:26:05 Hello welcome back
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:26:41 Man just argued with me that you can't put 2 images infront of a script and it will tell if they are similar
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:26:48 üòê
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:27:03 Mf captcha does it
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:28:13 Lmao
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:30:40 The thing is you can assign players custom labels if it can't find out what it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:30:53 It just says "Custom" if it can't identify it
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:31:33 ***The square.***
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:31:49 It's used for identifying people in the future
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:31:59 Also did you not hear me?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:32:03 It's a Target exploit
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:32:08 You click the player
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:32:19 It will begin to target it with a secondary script
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:32:49 If it didn't target
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:33:16 Nah it's literally just ESP + modified player movements but fancy
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:34:20 To be fair you can detach the secondary script and just make it a cross hair thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:34:31 For style points yknow?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:34:42 Also could be a cool thing to use in custom videos
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:35:30 The reason I don't just make my own
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:35:38 Is I'm shit at lua and c++
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:36:30 
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:36:57 (real)
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:37:00 Anyway
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:37:27 I had a fun time arguing with someone saying a script built to see similarities between 2 images isn't possible
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:37:43 :l
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:38:33 
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:40:00 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:40:10 Literal aimbots use that trick
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:42:18 Honestly I have an idea for the nose
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:42:30 Pyramid wedge + large jet engine motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:43:19 Because you said it looked ridiculous so I suggested an idea on how to make it less ridiculous
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:44:06 Ughh
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 10:44:10 Angle lockinh

the-dump 2022-09-25 10:04:04 taking my leave from plane crazy
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:04:16 its on a downwards spiral from here thanks to u
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:04:29 shredder user.
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:11:13 I was
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:11:29 but i noticed how toxic shredders were
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:11:36 they do nothing but make pvp worse
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:11:51 why make something that ruins the fun of everything?
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:13:29 cya
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:13:33 loser
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:15:30 as a previous shredder user
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:15:32 simply
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:15:36 they are super efficient
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:15:41 for the time you spend building them
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:15:46 to pvp usage
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:00 ehhh shredders are boring if you just follow tutorials
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:01 can say
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:17 making custom shredders like these are fun
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:21 but
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:25 ruin the fun everything
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:36 so
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:38 i choose not to
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:46 why have fun at other peoples expense
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:16:51 is my question
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:17:20 no i mean actually custom
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:17:23 not just
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:17:24 well you see
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:17:29 there is a ball version of this
the-dump 2022-09-25 10:17:33 must mean its different

general 2022-10-19 04:57:07 Hypo meaning low
general 2022-10-19 04:57:20 Scale referring to ro-scale

general 2022-10-19 04:58:26 ok
general 2022-10-19 04:59:24 This offset balance of skill in his blood caused his kidneys to shut down
general 2022-10-19 04:59:38 without proper functioning kidney's an infection spread throughout his body

general 2022-10-27 16:09:08 I feel disappointed yet also I'm kind of confused how someone puts so much design into a fucking shredder-
general 2022-10-27 16:10:12 An actual fucking upgrade though lmao

plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:54:34 Can I get a volunteer please?
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:56:53 Not much we can do
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:57:24 I could load me PCA but that will fry the server instead of stopping lag
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:57:26 So
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:58:45 Anyway
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:58:51 May I get a volunteer?
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 05:59:16 A fairly larger build with a fast speed preferably? (I hate working with decimals)
general 2022-11-03 06:11:47 Go to <#384021699466756107> would be cool if you volunteered mr box
plane-crazy 2022-11-03 06:14:07 Nvm

bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:22:03 sorry for pinging 2 mods
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:22:04 but i'd rather not have like 50 people getting the funny idea of crashing servers with this thing
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:29 i was the second discoverer of this lag machine
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:30 and

bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:33 annoying
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:34 as
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:36 it lasts forever
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:39 no need to respawn
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:23:47 and destroys the server as long as its running
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:24:34 yeah]
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:24:36 not fun
bug-reports 2022-11-18 21:24:38 to have around

the-dump 2022-11-29 07:27:22 Wait the ASA
the-dump 2022-11-29 07:27:25 I heard of that
the-dump 2022-11-29 07:38:22 May I remind you jannu07 was the reason for the spread of Omni bugs?

the-dump 2022-11-29 08:21:41 
general 2022-11-29 08:39:17 Id like to point out he's with CSA
general 2022-11-29 08:39:43 We have tech that shuts down services that doesn't need to be loaded every minute and a half
general 2022-11-29 08:39:46 ‚òï
general 2022-11-29 08:39:58 It can last up to forever, just sayin
general 2022-11-29 08:40:25 Oh hey boxness, don't mind CSA being noticed by PCC
general 2022-11-29 08:40:34 We are not a real thing
general 2022-11-29 08:40:39 üëç
general 2022-11-29 08:40:59 We are totally fake (real)
general 2022-11-29 08:42:33 The middle point is half of the 4 at A-D
general 2022-11-29 08:43:01 Find the center by dividing the 4 in half
general 2022-11-29 08:43:04 ‚òï
general 2022-11-29 08:43:45 (half of the 4 means the center of the circle is revealed and thus the radius and diameter)
general 2022-11-29 08:43:54 ***cough***
general 2022-11-29 08:44:23 Half of 4 is 2
general 2022-11-29 08:44:36 Remove the 2 from the 8 on c-b
general 2022-11-29 08:44:41 6
general 2022-11-29 08:44:45 6 is the radius
general 2022-11-29 08:44:54 Diameter is 2x the radius
general 2022-11-29 08:45:11 12 inches is the diameter
general 2022-11-29 08:45:25 Do the conversion equation with pi from there
general 2022-11-29 08:46:07 Area = 3.14 x radius times itself or the power of 2
general 2022-11-29 08:46:21 Basically
general 2022-11-29 08:46:26 6x6 is 36
general 2022-11-29 08:46:32 36 x 3.14
general 2022-11-29 08:46:54 113.04
general 2022-11-29 08:47:07 113.04 Inches squared
general 2022-11-29 08:47:20 6 is the radius
general 2022-11-29 08:47:37 Area of a circle is 3.14 x the radius with the power of 2
general 2022-11-29 08:47:47 6 to the power of 2 is 36
general 2022-11-29 08:47:57 36 x 3.14 is 113.04
general 2022-11-29 08:48:05 113.04 inches squared
general 2022-11-29 08:49:27 Bc is centered but it's center POINT isn't
general 2022-11-29 08:49:38 Da divided in half gives 2
general 2022-11-29 08:49:44 Minus 2 from the 8
general 2022-11-29 08:49:47 You get 6
general 2022-11-29 08:50:01 You get 6
general 2022-11-29 08:50:05 Same either way
general 2022-11-29 08:50:26 Do the equation from there
general 2022-11-29 08:50:37 113.04 inches squared is the area of the circle
general 2022-11-29 08:51:34 Or skip out on all the equations and just half D-A and subtract that from B-C
general 2022-11-29 08:52:27 We're not nerds for passing 5th grade dude
general 2022-11-29 08:52:48 If you don't know the answer, you're probably an unde as it's 5-6th grade work
general 2022-11-29 08:53:34 Colorado
general 2022-11-29 08:53:46 A fairly under taught country too
general 2022-11-29 08:54:14 Btw
general 2022-11-29 08:54:22 You can skip literally all of that work
general 2022-11-29 08:54:39 The answers already there
general 2022-11-29 08:54:43 D c
general 2022-11-29 08:54:55 Like 9-10
general 2022-11-29 08:55:03 Not even sure
general 2022-11-29 08:55:18 Leme check rq
general 2022-11-29 08:55:27 Yeah
general 2022-11-29 08:55:48 Ages 9-11 In Colorado are usually in 5th grade
general 2022-11-29 08:57:27 Could just be a flaw when creating the diagram
general 2022-11-29 08:58:46 English 100
general 2022-11-29 08:58:50 Also I see what you mean
general 2022-11-29 08:59:01 Maybe bc aint centered
general 2022-11-29 08:59:38 Yeah it does
general 2022-11-29 09:00:21 Center point?
general 2022-11-29 09:01:03 A middle point in any diagram is often called a center point
general 2022-11-29 09:02:05 Whatever it is, dividing that 4 in half still gives us a middle point for the x axis
general 2022-11-29 09:02:12 We can use that as reference
general 2022-11-29 09:02:37 Was bc but not so sure now
general 2022-11-29 09:02:55 As it does seem misplaced
general 2022-11-29 09:03:33 Yeah
general 2022-11-29 09:03:57 The real question is how do we find the length of the new y axis
general 2022-11-29 09:04:09 Seems easy but im a bit tired
general 2022-11-29 09:04:14 Give me a sec to wake up
general 2022-11-29 09:04:35 Thanks for the coffee, appreciate
general 2022-11-29 09:04:42 Helped me through a lot of exams
general 2022-11-29 09:04:53 We become yellow
general 2022-11-29 09:06:09 Tmi
general 2022-11-29 09:07:16 The d and a cut in half really isn't to find radius, it's just to find the x axis as a center point to cut the y axis by if we ACTUALLY FIND IT RAGGGHHH
general 2022-11-29 09:08:16 Because we have lives and don't waste our life away creating jets to get colored names in a Roblox discord server
general 2022-11-29 09:08:27 We spend that same time studying
general 2022-11-29 09:08:31 As we don't want to fail
general 2022-11-29 09:10:16 Eager let's let these men argue over simple colors in a Roblox discord server while us, intellects solve this fine math problem bestowed upon us
general 2022-11-29 09:10:57 About that?
general 2022-11-29 09:11:48 Meh that's fine, just don't argue over the colors and it'll be fine
general 2022-11-29 09:12:03 Like

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:54:52 but if we're talking a tech omni shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:54:55 infinite speeds
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:54:58 as goofy as that sounds
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:55:32 he meant superior in the terms of superior to the other versions of the omni
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:55:57 alright
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:56:31 use ice to make that roll for even longer
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:58:14 insert speech bubble here
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:00 ice still has friction
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:09 everything, has friction
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:17 motor heads dont, but their bases do
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:55 the physics
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:58 roblox updated
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:02 again
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:14 they brought back that old physics system that was ass about a month ago
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:19 fucking roblox
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:26 üòê
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:05 ^
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:10 you cant rush angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:36 maybe has has no force on the piston
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:06:39 idk
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:06:58 yeah motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:07:37 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxKSQco7mE0&ab_channel=dragonplatinum
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:08:47 camera lock is worse than text lock, for locking purposes
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:08:55 but because it welds to the main player seat when locked
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:09:00 it can have
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:09:03 interesting applications
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:09:13 Ex: floating parts attatched to your build
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:09:17 despite having no clear weld
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:16 camera locking
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:19 has more purposes
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:33 for tech and wireless welding
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:38 then it does for locking
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:44 btw: cameras can be used as armors
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:52 as they do what ladders do: deflect auto aim rockets when spun
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:10:57 without needing to spin.
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:11:09 also they dont have contact with rockets so they COMPLETELY deflect it
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:11:53 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebRnyet2LOM
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:12:20 like rocket engines or rockets the pvp weapon
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:12:33 rockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:12:36 can be put on turrets
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:12:37 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:12:50 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:13:22 false
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:13:28 you can make blocks go into each other
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:13:30 with motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:18 again
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:19 the tower method
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:22 can be repeated
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:23 so yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:28 you can make blocks go into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:39 well there is still sign lock and cam lock but still
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:14:58 ^^^^
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:05 nooooo
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:08 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:11 you can use
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:14 a motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:20 to put blocks into each otherr
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:15:23 AS MANY AS YOU WANT
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:16:34 those are more complicated to understand than motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:16:35 so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:16:37 i agree with the Eh
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:22:15 yeah those are for other use cases
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:24:01 
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:07:51 Maybe y'all shouldn't discuss an anti shred server in the server CSA heavily monitors, if y'all want to create a weapon to kill our shredders. Make a weapon to basically bypass invincibility then.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:12:12 War declaration, CSA and ASC, Signed by one awaiting the others declaration, do you accept johnny?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:16:02 I'll take that as a yes.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:19:08 Got it.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:23:10 Axis locking, makes it so it doesn't matter how damaged our shredders are, as long as there's an engine it will work, and to kill all the engines on the shred well, you need to damage it which you can't when we can toggle invincibility
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:25:48 Me when I just said I have invincibility and he just said "weakness" üòêüëç
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:30:14 Roscale plane +1000000 votes in PCC creations üëç (btw nice job it actually looks good)
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:32:17 "Invincibility is fake news, it's easily countered by slowing the physics engine" What? I'm sorry you just extremely confused me; how is slowing the physics related at all to toggling no damage mode
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:34:25 Me when disabling particals: me when blacklisting you:
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:37:08 You haven't heard about the blacklist cutter trick have you? Basically it buffs cutters by making it so they can phase through you while still doing damage, basically collusion isn't a factor anymore but you still do damage
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:43:45 No it isn't, also this is factually untrue and here's why. (You are wrong in saying we can't kill them all at once, and second we STILL can toggle invincibility)
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:45:50 If you want to kill us, and I'm giving you a tip so you stand a chance. GET IN CONTACT WITH UNCF the spaceship group, they have tech that can provide useful against us
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:47:56 You're welcome, I've seen hundreds of groups like yours over the years and I feel bad, so ill help you out leader to leader. ONCE as an exception: take it as a goodwill for men
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:49:58 You will have to find them yourselves, so start searching I gave you a hint I'm not giving you the straight answer, BTW take inspiration from another old group that actually caused an era in plane crazy, AST: make warships with gyros, also dms johnny
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:52:14 Johnny go to dms, no slow mode there plus we can talk without moderation and thousands of ppl watching us
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:54:16 Still pretty good ngl having a cool view of y'all's group it's kinda pretty honestly
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:56:47 Sweet have fun man spaceships are fun to build, personally my favorite was building the amber clad
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:03:25 Still got a crystal clear view of ASC, y'all keep freaking out over minor things like me mentioning axis lock LMAO: that god damn tech was made before shredders even existed
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:10:10 Still a good clear view over ASC, I'm noticing y'all are banning quite a few ppl trying to sus out the rats, yall kinda bad at it lol
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:12:14 Yeah you're very meanie I give up on life now ):, btw who the hell are you jiro, anyway I'm going to bed for now let's see this group age like milk
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:27:49 So what I'm seeing Is ASC's thinking subs and sky camo are going to kill us, BRUH WE LITERALLY USE SKY CAMO ON THE NORMAL BASIS ü§°
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:38:02 Fyi: subs are literally useless, we fixed the water+blade issue about 2 years ago and we have water propellors so literally water is just air V2 for us, so don't even try
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:40:08 We have one in every group in plane crazy, we got eyes on everything and everyone at most times, only ones we don't got spies in are niche ones that are small or don't pose danger to us at all, btw sword here's an answer to your question: because it's fun lol
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:42:22 Random kids making an anti shredder community (ASC) thinking they can stand up to 50k speed shredders with forcefields and tech that can literally toggle damage on or off, sorry but whatever you do it won't do anything to us so here's a great tip: leave us alone and we leave you alone (btw stefix usually ask around or go searching for people you nah believe are in a group)
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:44:28 It was Chad believer of God lol, also fyi: answer to you golden, it also makes the player take no DMG, nothing takes damage during the invincibility
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:53:45 As I mentioned before in ASC's leaders dm or someone, We don't use these in public, we use them for wars and or personal duels. We usually use casual jets in public and only use these when provoked per say like a random anti shred group attacking us simply for existing
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:56:06 That I agree with, 80% of the time they're boring but then you come across those good jet fighters and it's a fucking blast to duel them, and that's only amplified if they aren't toxic.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:58:12 Probably too much weight or too little torque, if the torque is max already Add another motor 2 and or a powered motor with no configs, no speed, and no torque and that should fix it, if it's too heavy, balance the weight somehow, also btw stefix guided missiles do exist
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:00:41 No those don't exist unless you're using scripts and or wait Mr kitten reminded me, there's a glitch with magnets where you can get it to attract to other players builds so maybe you can make a missile with that
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:15:09 Now <@761354294859005962>, Come check these things out
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:39:08 Oh well I helped exilir8 create the first shred tutorial and <@924390413505298453> here made the first Omni bug tutorial with santa381, sspherical used to be in CSA too but he noped out and quit plane crazy :/
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:47:08 
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 11:04:47 Namnam guide has all of them listed
creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:42:55 Custom shredders with about 3 hours worth of building put into each one, they don't even resemble any low skill shredder from before: only aspect is the 6 arms, also it's not my business what a guy does with his tech as he already has it and I can't control anything that he chooses to do with it, wish I could help but this isn't my problem and it lies with rational, not me
creations-chat 2022-12-12 14:57:15 I do hate those people too but normally when you are truly maneuverable is when you can go any speed and do any turn without wobble or issue, what isn't maneuverability is just going haha I have propellors ***backflips***, but again I can't control the people who do that: I can only persuade them not to
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 15:03:53 Skybounce gyro I built for my amber clad ship, just gives me a full turn without needing to wait to build speed back up, insanely useful <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2022-12-13 07:31:54 Don't forget to add CSA to the bottom of the iceberg, as well as Exilir8 didn't create the first ever shredder tutorial alone, ***I helped him make it***
creations-chat 2022-12-13 07:37:01 Pretty sure he meant to say motor 3, and best to let him explain, I over explain everything, ask him not me
creations-chat 2022-12-13 07:39:40 Fyi go to gjsolos Pain crazy 3 video, our rod shredder makes a star entrance and just bonks gj lol, also motor 4 I've never heard of, only motor 1, 2, and 3 elaborate pls cuz I've never heard of this apparently
creations-chat 2022-12-13 07:47:00 Motor 4, elaborate I am unenlightened on this subject
creations-chat 2022-12-13 09:10:33 Gl trying, contact me if you need help finding them
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 14:41:40 I mentioned nothing of this also no, that's just an invincible cloak but you can't use weapons while cloaked nor are you truly invincible, the one im talking about requires no deployment and allows you to go invisible while having weapons still working
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 14:43:37 Also you are actually truly invincible so if you disable the invisibility you're still invincible
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 14:44:07 So gl
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 15:28:04 Me when I use it to improve performance on spaceships in vip servers:
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:54:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:54:18 if spun
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:54:38 its due to their goofy hitbox and AOE attraction radius with rockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:54:57 why would you just use ladders though
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:04 tnt and 1x7's are immune to rockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:16 Rockets phase through tnt, and 1x7's dont take dmg from rockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:22 but 1x7's are damaged by guns,
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:26 but tnt absorbs gun shots
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:31 so make a 1x7 and tnt armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:34 its called composite armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:42 now
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:48 currently the best armor in the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:49 is called
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:55:53 Spaced composite armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:56:06 its spaced 3 blocks from the main build to ignore the effects of rocket AOE damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:56:25 if you've ever met tank_1944
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 01:56:31 these are the principles he uses for his tanks
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:01:05 did i say armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:01:08 or anti damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:01:20 just a question.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:01:32 
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:01:57 it literally allows you to toggle invincibility
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:02 so it doesn't matter if you get hit
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:07 :/
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:17 but
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:19 that ruins
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:20 all the fun
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:25 so go with armor and agility
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:26 100%
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:41 the armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:45 makes it so you cant take damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:52 but if you are unlucky as to have left a weak spot
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:54 Agility
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:02:56 is your best friend
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:23 tank_1944/tanky has incorperated both
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:26 into his tanks
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:36 fyi he uses something called Downforce to always keep his tanks on the ground
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:41 so it doesn't matter how fast he goes
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:45 he doesn't even need suspension
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:52 and his tanks go around 6k
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:03:53 on ground
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:04:00 + armor
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:04:05 its why he's an admirable foe
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:04:26 uhmmm
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:04:55 technically you can motor lock the composite armor into a 1x7 block
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:02 and it just becomes an unbreakable block
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:08 but the motor lock itself is a weak point
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:11 so bad idea
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:34 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:37 hey computer
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:45 discussing more tech with the community
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:49 this time spaced composite
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:05:59 its already known and a guide on it is made
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:06:07 so im feeling free to share
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:06:47 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItUMUtFJsUc&ab_channel=mocmeo
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:06:50 here's the guide
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:08:22 true
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:08:31 he's toxic
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:08:44 but his knowledge on armors and spin breeches is quite extensive
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:01 Im glad to work with him
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:04 also being his friend
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:08 gives you a STRAIGHT door
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:09 into CSA
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:12 and the tech community
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:30 if you become friends with tanky
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:09:33 you meet a person called Beyond
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:10:05 but
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:10:09 beyonds aware of this
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:10:18 so
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:10:19 :/
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:10:38 from the incident where someone in PCC reported it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:11:31 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:11:33 =
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:11:35 /gamemode creative
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:11:58 i try NOT to use it though
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:00 as it completely
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:02 ruins the experience
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:04 for everyone
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:10 Yeah for performance stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:12 and cool animations
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:16 y'know
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:19 the only non toxic use for it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:27 otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:29 its a gateway
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:38 for everyone to just go /gamemode creative and kill pvp
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:12:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:13:16 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:13:22 everything we do is ingame
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:13:25 we despise exploits
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:16 it won't be
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:28 there's 30 rules
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:33 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:37 if you were to try to leak it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:42 You would either
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:45 not understand it yourself
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:50 or no one seeing the leak
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:51 would
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:14:58 toutou03
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:15:16 I only work with toutou on the tech stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:15:21 i tell no one else how to make this shit'
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:15:30 we are both very well aware of the consequences of this being leaked
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:15:47 strange question
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:15:49 depends
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:07 to make your vehicle compatible you have to make certain modifications, to your build
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:16 the tech itself is relatively small
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:19 the modifications
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:22 are incredibly complex
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:31 also controlling it all
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:35 is even more complex
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:51 More.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:16:59 + keybind Combinations
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:14 most of them are just to start up the tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:18 like only 8 are assigned
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:21 to the tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:24 after its activated
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:46 funny screenshots
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:56 and also funny moments
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:59 where ppl are like
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:00 BRUH
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:01 HAXXING
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:05 HACKR!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:31 PCC and y'all are just learning about it now
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:57 its as simplified as possible
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:19:03 toutou has worked on it for years
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:19:16 been playing since early 2018 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:01 i think you've only really seen our begginer-mid level shreds
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:03 like
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:07 the weakest models in CSA
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:09 go 15k
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:21 my k√§mpfer, can go Infinite speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:35 thats why i've created a new glitch to use as a weapon
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:40 that works at any speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:55 its called axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:58 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:21:01 you go near it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:21:03 you die instantly
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:21:08 you dont even need to touch it.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:21:24 We still use mid-term shredders in servers but nothing at all with tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:21:57 Collective Shredder Alliance
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:22:17 
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:22:19 CSA
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:22:29 you remember jannu or OBL
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:22:32 anyone remember them?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:22:50 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:22 a group called OBL was founded by the guy who helped santa381 create the first omni tut, jannu07
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:34 in 2019
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:39 and basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:42 OBL
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:46 went to war
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:51 AST
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:51 with another insanely powerful group
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:23:56 who are new weak ASF
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:01 and the owner has been exposed as a ped
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:06 but anyway
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:13 Jannu ended up allying with AST
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:17 to ignore conflicts
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:19 but basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:30 Since jannu was the leader of OBL, but AST had full control over him
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:35 AST were our superiors
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:39 and half of OBL rebelled
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:42 a civil war started
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:24:44 CSA was birthed
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:10 CSA was the result of a civil war, and we're a very war and battle hungry group
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:15 PCA-001
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:20 it instantly cuts connection
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:22 between the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:25 and other players
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:29 it renders everyone useless
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:33 Except the person using it.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:36 you cant load
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:39 you cant respawn
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:44 you cant do anything but walk and talk
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:25:47 and build
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:26:17 its a technique
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:26:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:26:31 it by itself
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:26:34 can't really do much
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:26:41 its again, the rules and modifications to your vehicle WITH it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:01 im not explaining HOW it works, but the result is basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:11 you have full control over your vehicle and the physics that apply to it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:15 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:18 full control over physics
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:24 its why its used heavily in spaceship groups
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:35 its insanely potent and a must have for large spaceships
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:41 you know axi lock?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:52 we use tnt as a disconnecting agent
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:27:55 everything else
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:01 either Leaves a part behind
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:03 or
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:05 is technically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:07 2 components
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:12 like springs
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:27 yeah we have axis lock down to a 2x2x3
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:31 so fucking small
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:39 we use it on a gyro so its jet compatible too
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:44 Yeah, we've made axis lock jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:28:57 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:07 the 360 100% damage cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:11 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:17 rotating pattern of diamond cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:21 it does damage in all directions
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:22 360
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:27 and 100% damage as every part of the blade
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:29 does damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:30 and it wastes
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:31 no space
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:52 you may see it heavily utilized in our mid term OG bugs
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:29:57 no need
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:30:02 blacklist glitch actually degrades cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:30:08 does less dmg, and also makes a delay
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:30:12 plus no fling/collision
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:30:23 we have another tech that brings cutters to their max efficiency/damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:30:57 No i know
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:03 but i literally have a code viewing tool
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:07 i can see the view
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:11 of the code in any game
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:13 turns out
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:19 cutters when blacklist is turned on
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:25 Work at less high speeds
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:30 it goes down from 700 to 300
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:35 and the delay time
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:36 is longer
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:31:57 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:05 its when people piss me off
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:09 that i become
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:19 an insane arsehole
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:46 Im sorry plz no ground me mo- oh wait im 18
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:51 https://tenor.com/view/kanye-west-stare-serious-gif-15710427
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:32:59 still dont ground me
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:00 üò≠
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:34 i am 1 foot tall registered and fact checked by obama himself
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:40 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:43 its again
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:50 just used to disconnect
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:33:53 it leaves no effect
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:08 anyway seriously im 6 foot
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:24 i wanna say 5'11 so bad because it sounds more realistic but the truth of it is im 6f
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:37 can i just like
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:41 shrink by 1 inch
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:43 please
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:34:56 what god do i pray to or piss off enough to lower my height by 1 inch
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:35:01 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:35:29 https://tenor.com/view/up-is-not-jump-knee-snap-saw-broken-leg-gif-15071407
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:35:41 just cut my legs off
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:35:45 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/922015099886129172/1013240047174156298/confident.gif
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:35:56 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:07 it has to be connected
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:08 somehow
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:13 but it dosn't have to be directly welded
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:15 or inside
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:20 its a roblox glitch
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:26 its been found in other games like BABFT
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:34 rickje can't really patch it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:38 more so
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:36:41 make it harder to do
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:02 there's 2 different things btw tail
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:13 because i don't care about funny color discord name
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:18 which is
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:19 Axis control
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:21 and axis lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:33 1 locks your axis and you can't really toggle or choose which axis is locked
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:37:42 axis control lets you toggle and untoggle any axis that you want
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:04 Its been used on mechs
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:06 many times before
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:09 stops tilting entirely
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:15 its insanely useful
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:24 got my own vip server
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:36 yeah wrong reply
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:38 mb
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:38:58 fyi:
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:00 big shocker
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:04 gjsolo is just another jet user
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:18 sorry to burst the 20% of ppl in pcc who think he's a god/genius
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:21 but when i dueled him
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:28 he's a jet but more confident with more skill
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:29 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:34 he's what i want the jet community
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:36 to be
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:39 not just
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:42 L i shoot ground targets
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:39:58 the cloaking device?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:23 yeah that one
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:26 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:29 it makes the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:33 think you're in 1 position
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:36 despite being in another
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:44 so you become 'invincible' but if you shoot
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:46 the position
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:49 the server sees you in
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:53 well
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:40:57 you aren't very invincible anymore
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:41:07 most of it no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:41:48 are all possible
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:41:50 on mobile
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:42:00 but stuff like the tech that brings cutters to their max
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:42:10 all not compatible
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:42:17 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:42:24 is a whole branch
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:42:25 of tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:02 and it can be
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:17 also proving the theory these are roblox glitches
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:19 like BABFT
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:24 though
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:29 its so fucking hard to do it in those games
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:32 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:43:34 just makes it easy
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:07 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:11 It doesn't make other people change
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:16 you
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:18 and you alone
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:26 but if you turn your pvp on in BABFT
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:44:37 you still won't take dmg
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:00 true axis lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:01 btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:06 Makes it so you cant tilt
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:07 at all
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:09 no matter the speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:11 pressure
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:18 or glitch out happening on your vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:21 Force axis lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:24 is a weaker version
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:26 while still strong
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:32 after enough pressure it starts to tilt a little
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:46:34 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:02 uses true axis control
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:06 Not force axis control
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:10 or force axis lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:14 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:20 the best form of axis tech out there
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:38 not sure
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:47:45 really haven't tested mobile with true axis control
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:04 i've def tried true axis lock and force axis lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:08 force axis lock works
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:18 true axis locks work but its much more complicated to get set up
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:33 oh this is the beyond guy i mentioned
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:35 and hello beyond
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:48:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:07 nice breath of fresh air seeing someone in PCC respect another person (literally impossible)
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:29 its still incredibly hard to get in WITH a friend
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:36 my verification stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:39 has no sway
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:41 from
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:44 preference
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:49 and only i moderate it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:51 plus
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:49:55 there's 3 verifications
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:04 and a giant watchful eye called jannu07
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:17 what is that again?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:23 the uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:25 the rods?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:35 hold on
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:38 what r u talking bout
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:50:50 show me the ss of my shred your referencing
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:12 the sky camo
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:13 Ohhhh
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:14 the rods
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:16 yeah no
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:26 they can be HEAVILY reverse engineered to true axis Lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:27 but rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:31 the roblox physics update
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:34 screwed that over
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:46 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:49 the rods are basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:51:59 mach speed cutters as an expanding sphere on our shreds
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:02 also ask <@298889462740418560>
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:04 more on rods
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:06 as he's the person
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:09 who made rods
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:28 turns out their claim of "improving performance" is factually false
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:37 they actually worsened roblox's processing even more
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:52:50 to the point tanky is about to give up
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:03 he's so utterly pissed off about all the degrades in roblox
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:41 to be fair
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:46 you need to know about spin breeches
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:53:54 and how to truly manage downforce and the composite armor stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:08 he alone can go on a tech tangent about conventional tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:16 while i can go on a tangent about this alien tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:32 its as the name implies
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:33 DOwn
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:34 Force
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:48 it applies huge force downwards to keep the tank on the ground
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:54 huge force
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:54:57 by any means
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:08 glitch engines, alien tech engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:09 whatever
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:16 but its not as easy as it sounds
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:20 its not just that
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:32 if you ask tanky, he'll tell you how to place it and manage it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:49 also
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:51 if you Just
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:55:58 make a downwards hover engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:56:05 if you get flinged upward somehow someway
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:56:06 your uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:56:10 gonna spin in circles
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:56:13 until you deload that thing

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:01:49 you gotta remember the same game there's alien tech and lore since 2018
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:01:55 also has this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:01:56 in it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 03:02:03 roblox

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:26:19 rickje said
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:26:27 saw blocks will not be replacing cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:26:34 they will be their own block with seperate functions
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:26:53 
general 2022-12-15 06:07:37 You should make a shredder bug medal for me
general 2022-12-15 06:07:40 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 07:04:45 I don't know about them or care about what they do
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 07:08:23 Meh idc it isn't affecting me and they aren't showing it to the general public to my knowledge
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:43:47 dyson
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:43:47 ah
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:11 a kid we removed from CSA cuz we had huge proof
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:13 he was underage
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:22 also
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:26 not only is the color scheme
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:27 of CSA
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:29 Sky blue
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:33 but the cutter pattern
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:35 is unique to us
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:42 the 360 design that does damage on all sides
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:44:51 
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:45:01 those 2 almost always indicate
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:45:10 CSA or affiliated to CSA somehow
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:45:30 he was a beginner in our grou
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:45:56 lol if we spot you with the 360 cutter design and sky camo but not in  CSA

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:53:02 to basically a half a month later
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:53:10 knowing how to play complex songs

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:54:37 hello
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:54:49 also what ever happened to ASC
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:54:52 they kinda died a little
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:54:56 so little activity
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:55:04 i think they absolutely shit themselves
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:55:17 their like
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:55:58 lets create a brand new TNT gun strategy- Me: I'm invincible, ASC: oh well bye I give up
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:56:06 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:56:13 tnt is an armor and disconnection piece
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:56:16 sometimes a weapon
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:56:25 but tnt balls are better as a weapon unless motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:56:49 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:07 having multiple anchors sometimes increases chances of absolutely glitching TF out
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:15 do you dissapear for a split second?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:17 then reappear
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:20 then you cant use anything
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:24 yeah thats reality disable
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:30 its useless
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:33 unless weaponized
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 02:57:44 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:07:06 plane crazy military groups
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:07:26 CSA has been #1 along with UNCF for around 2 years due to tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:07:36 they're smart if you know what you're doing
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:07:59 otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:00 i agree
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:03 a bit of
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:05 tomfoolery
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:06 happens
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:13 with groups that take things too seriously
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:41 ye im a shred user
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:44 for the fun of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:08:56 jets can be just as powerful as shreds and vice versa
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:09:03 just shredders have their rep shitted on
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:09:09 and i often go with the underdog

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:10:36 if it stands still next to you
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:10:38 it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:10:53 name me 1 tech that doesn't somehow involve anchors

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:08 aight guys
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:13 ***Turns invincible***
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:29 CSA will
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:30 almost
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:32 NEVER
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:11:36 pull out big tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:12:41 btw before i have another aneurysm because people are saying cutters will be replaced in PC2, NO THEY FUCKING WONT RAGHHH!!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:20 https://tenor.com/view/aneurysm-hhhhomeboyyyy-kings-dark-tidings-saga-by-kel-kade-reaperleviathan-head-explode-gif-21578105
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:30 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:31 the saw
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:34 it won't be replacing the cutter
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:52 saws would prob do more damage Over time
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:13:55 at the cost of Size
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:04 so bigger damage, but size and time are a factor
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:22 Plus
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:27 the more likely answer
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:33 is it will be a DPS damage weapon
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:35 unlike cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:14:51 (Unless you use a singular god damn motor with a cutter then it becomes a dps weapon)_
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:15:09 camera locks
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:15:22 to keep our rods from completely just destabilizing the bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:16:25 understand the importance of speed and damage qualities
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:16:47 you can't just have an unstable incredibly fast mid damage bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:04 you either need to be a jack of all cards, extremely good at all, or just don't use a bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:07 like the original
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:09 shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:12 lacks in speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:14 big stability
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:16 lacks in damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:21 its the reason its absolute Garbage
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:39 our shredders
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:46 even begginer-mid term
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:51 Incredibly fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:54 Incredibly stable
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:58 godlike damage
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:31 also there's a reason our master roles have never lost a singular battle in plane crazy unless it was against other masters or better CSA members
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:35 Piloting
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:51 Don't let the normal propaganda of shredders completely confuse you
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:54 most shredders
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:56 are extremely basic
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:18:58 just like
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:01 follow with your mouse
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:05 but better bugs
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:07 have keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:09 left and right
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:15 this needs to be pressed here and there
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:27 they were literally just a guided missile with cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:29 i would know
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:36 because i helped exilir8 create the first tut for it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:52 literally designed to just be a missile with cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:20:01 The community
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:20:06 has never noticed and or recognized my work
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:20:08 on the cause of shreds
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:20:38 i've literally been fighting this war since shredders came out mf!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:20:54 to be fair i did take a month long break only to come back to shredders on the absolute fucking backheel
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:11 a patch update, dwindling shred users, weaknesses exposed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:22 i came back to that shit
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:24 and i was like
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:26 HELL NAHHH
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:33 Lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:41 i'm proud but not very proud in the creation of the shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:49 im proud it grew to the status it is today
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:57 im very not proud of how many toxic dumbasses used it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:02 and ruined its reputation
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:23 as you can tell with CSA bugs have huge potential, but its wasted on these toxic underaged kids
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:42 they think
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:47 Lol shredder = win
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:51 and win = everyone else is bad
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:52 L
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:54 i win guys
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:57 you guys all suck!!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:18 exilir8 made the tut, I gave him the idea for the missile with a cutter and ecouraged him to make a tut
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:22 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:27 im 1/2 the reason shredders exist
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:45 plus
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:53 i thought it would be used as a reloadable missile back then
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:00 like if smaller varients were to be made
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:02 and since it aint tnt
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:08 it could be like reusable guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:21 i didn't expect people to just use the tut itself and rampage every god damn server
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:30 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:33 i just thought
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:35 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:39 guided missile with cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:44 could be used in so many applications
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:04 yet the application it was used for was a server eating monstrosity rampaging plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:28 after my 3 week break after the tut was made and i came back
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:32 the first time i saw a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:41 was the squid varient but in a giant army
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:44 and i was like
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:50 Oh shit, i caused this didn't I
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:26:28 i then proceeded to dunk on their asses with a slightly more advanced shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:26:48 and there begun my god damn power scaling
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:08 going from slightly advanced OG bug to infinite speed unkillable super shreds with 6 arms going invisible and teleporting
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:14 https://tenor.com/view/hog-boar-emoji-mindblown-mind-blown-slideshow-meme-gif-26390794
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:25 i have never
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:30 seen a tut shred user
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:33 advance their shred
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:38 they either swapped the cutters out for guns
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:43 or added more cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:55 it was depressing to see no imagination kids just thinking
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:56 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:58 more = better
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:28:42 dragon bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:28:49 so many ppl have
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:28:57 the literal logo/pfp of CSA
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:02 is a shredder cube
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:20 did it look like this?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:39 ohhh wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:43 ik the guy your mentioning
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:52 was it filename and or jannu07?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:05 what was the user
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:07 do you remember?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:25 meh
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:33 to be fair it might have just been exploits
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:38 and or abusing half pistons
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:31:30 exploiter
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:21 they have a time and a place
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:56 Magnet engines = conveyor engines in power, accel is faster on magnets though and they have a small activation delay, also they tend to not explode or wobble
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:33:21 the names a misnomer btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:34:51 6860 speed is mach 1 in this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:35:04 the games speed measurment is studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:35:10 20 studs per second is 1 meter per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:35:13 do the math
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:35:19 you find mach 1 is 6860 speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:35:27 so mach 2 is 13720 speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:36:35 basic shredders in CSA usually fly around high mach 2 or mach 3
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:03 fyi
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:07 a block is 2.5 studs long
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:13 so divide Studs per second by 2.5
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:20 and you get blocks per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:40 chaotic
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:42 also prob laggy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:53 advanced shreds go around 90k+
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:19 our like final form shreds like kampfer go inf speeds
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:26 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:28 any glitch engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:32 but normally hovers
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:39 custom hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:45 that completely utilize hover engines'
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:39:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:39:11 btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:39:18 before you say the speed is for shits and giggles
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:39:30 CSA has become so good at dueling and shit that we've dueled up to 90k sps before
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:39:57 we're much much faster at processing what to do and where due to extensive training'
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:40:32 hello bubble
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:40:36 you're name is familiar
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:40:57 yeah we have once
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:01 but i dont remember when
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:15 righttt
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:30 it was when we were fucking railing that underage kid about discord TOS
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:49 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:52 lemee see ur plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:42:29 its a goofy plane but really well designed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:42:39 its basically when you put insane effort into a funny looking plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:14 i question the use of legacy glass though
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:28 it looks like u are lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:47 mans so good at angle locking he turned glass material into legacy glass
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:49 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:44:32 thats what he said
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:44:59 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:11 I know the difference
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:15 i've played more than 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:33 idk
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:35 try it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:40 i think legacy is ugglier
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:46 personally
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:46:07 why ü•≤
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:46:53 trolz is actooaly made in 2008!!!1!11!1! ü§ì
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:47:24 its due to the rendering
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:48:16 look through glass material and look at the ocean
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:48:20 it will become see through
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:48:26 as well as blacklists and plot lines
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:03 yep
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:16 thats roblox code
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:19 cant change that
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:21 plus
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:23 the fix to that
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:27 is just using legacy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:30 glass
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:23 also
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:29 why would you not want to use glass material
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:36 it means you can see through decals and the ocean
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:43 it makes spotting ppl a lot easier
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:35 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:43 just use helium weight removers
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:45 aka
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:49 +
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:49 unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:51 helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:07 +
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:09 helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:18 removes weight using helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:23 well
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:24 more so
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:34 a glitch revolving around unpowered motors + helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:55:46 + helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:56:09 + he li u h m
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:56:48 +hee lioom
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:03:34 we can use my own
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:03:35 im not poor
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:03:46 well
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:03:47 more so
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:03:59 i don't care about spending money on something i spend a lot of time doing
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:04:15 dms
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:27:45 crashed?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:10:25 Why do you care?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:10:48 Hail duckless!

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:12:17 Pff-
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:12:39 Special needs shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:13:09 I mean the engine system
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:13:17 Incomplete
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:13:41 Notice how they don't point directly at your mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:13:45 That's an issue
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:14:38 Live view of Icarus vs plato
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:16:00 Add motor 2's on the engine itself
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:16:05 Leme get a ss
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:18:08 Motor 2's facing into the side of the engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:18:19 That's why I didn't want you welding your engine to the tnt
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:15 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:21 Facing into the engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:36 Remove the extra motor 2 here
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:43 There's already one
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:19:48 No need for a second
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:21:53 Discussing how to make a shredder inside PCC:
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:22:00 First time in existence
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:22:08 And probably my last hour of existence
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:22:22 I'ma get doxxed and killed by the jet community because "shredder bad"

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:25:59 Siuuuuuuuu
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:32:19 Ye but 2 motors
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:32:21 Not just 1
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:32:25 Into the engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:32:37 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 06:32:46 I'll help tomorrow cuz I'ma go sleepy now
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:44:56 Or about 20 studs = 1 meter
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 14:45:16 It does, checked the source code
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:35:38 an official report by a roblox admin said 20 studs is 1 meter
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:35:51 but another suggests yours is 1 stud per 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:36:09 conflicting info
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:37:32 its interesting
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:37:49 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:41:03 2 official forums
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:41:09 each saying 1 is different than the other
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 22:41:39 I assumed he was talking about the measurment i was already familiar with and didn't feel the need to absolutely disect what he said

general 2022-12-22 06:16:39 for a while the official measurment of a stud
general 2022-12-22 06:16:40 was
general 2022-12-22 06:16:46 20 studs = 1 meter
general 2022-12-22 06:16:54 but now an actual roblox admin said 1 stud = 0.28 meters
general 2022-12-22 06:17:01 and i have to redo all my calculation shit
general 2022-12-22 06:17:19 but officialy
general 2022-12-22 06:17:25 that makes every robloxian in plane crazy
general 2022-12-22 06:17:29 3'6
general 2022-12-22 06:18:21 real!!!!
general 2022-12-22 06:18:33 anyway
general 2022-12-22 06:18:41 now i gotta redo all my equations and speed calculations
general 2022-12-22 06:18:52 games speed of measurment is studs per second
general 2022-12-22 06:18:53 so
general 2022-12-22 06:19:00 lets say 15k speed
general 2022-12-22 06:19:20 4200 meters per second
general 2022-12-22 06:19:42 thats mach 12.3

general 2022-12-22 06:21:19 looking at the roblox studio more
general 2022-12-22 06:21:23 i figured out a block isn't 2 studs
general 2022-12-22 06:21:25 its 2.5 studs
general 2022-12-22 06:21:36 :kanyestare:
general 2022-12-22 06:21:44 ye ik
general 2022-12-22 06:22:00 ye ik
general 2022-12-22 06:22:08 before roblox went out and said
general 2022-12-22 06:22:12 1 stud was 0.28 meters though
general 2022-12-22 06:22:21 The most relied upon answer
general 2022-12-22 06:22:30 was 20 studs = 1 meter
general 2022-12-22 06:26:57 that would have made us really small
general 2022-12-22 06:27:00 as robloxians

plane-crazy 2022-12-22 12:53:51 you fight a giant flying technological bird with a forcefield
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:09 basically
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:12 its in 2 parts
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:14 1 part
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:17 is called Axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:30 it uses a glitch to remove an axis off of anything or anyones vehicle that touches it
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:32 removing an axis
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:36 just causes the build
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:37 to dissapear
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:39 0 trace
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:51 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:52 but then
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:54 the second half
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:39:56 my Aoe tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:09 it converts tech into area of effect tech that's radius
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:13 can be controlled
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:18 in this case
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:22 axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:35 Yes, and no
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:37 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:38 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:41 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:42 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:45 rockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:47 are entities
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:53 With heavy modification
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:55 EVENTUALLY
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:59 is
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:40:59 but this tech im mentioning

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:34 if you want to retain the jets quality
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:37 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:42 you can only use this
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:44 on builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:46 that give
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:41:47 0 shits

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:47:13 its cuz of the axis removal
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:47:23 invulnerability doesn't apply to literal erasure
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:48:53 though there's a reason why i fear another glitch
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 15:48:58 you cant erase what isn't there

plane-crazy 2022-12-23 17:36:18 when blacklisting someone
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 17:36:22 and that would just

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:03:29 man even <@619312093962829849> would be too tall for this jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:03:34 and THATS saying something...
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:19:25 ok dyno
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:35:37 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:35:45 this jet is smaller than 5'5
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:35:49 the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:06 using accurate measurments
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:10 the space of the cockpit to the wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:13 is less then 5'5
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:16 you wouldn't fit
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:51 sitting doesn't change the height
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:36:55 only by like
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:03 0.13 of a block
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:15 miniscule
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:27 It does
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:30 but not by much
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:38 the seat itself would also still be
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:40 too large
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:52 you'd have to get on your knees
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:37:55 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:44:55 no not really
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:45:05 you forget we have right click
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:45:12 if you do right click with the mouse when ur turning
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:45:16 it turns With you
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:45:27 so you can turn thousands of times per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 22:45:34 but we just use it to turn instantly
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:19:28 Emia meaning presence in blood

plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:19:59 nope
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:20:37 nope
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:21:01 the answer is always jerma
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:21:05 1+1 = jerma
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:21:16 2 + 1939458289357923759234
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:21:17 =
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:21:20 jerma
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:23 i know the reason
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:35 here's the thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:49 leverage is still a thing in this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:52 your motors
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:59 couldn't keep up with the weight
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:01 and leverage
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:08 that the giant sword provided
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:16 There was a lack of torque to keep it in place
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:22 but as the torque took back over
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:30 it caused a little feedback circuit
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:36 it flopped then got pulled too hard
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:35:45 then flopped and got pulled back too hard Again
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:36:04 this is called motor stress
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:36:20 to fix this
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:36:26 add a block of helium
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:36:30 at the end of a blade
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:36:42 and see how it works
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:38:35 strange
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:38:41 1 sec
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:38:57 rq
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:38:57 show me ur m2m system
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:40:25 not the configs
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:40:30 im trying to just look at the system
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:44:51 thats all i needed to see
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:44:53 No
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:44:59 you do not have a 2 M2M setup
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:45:05 2 M2M setups use 4 motor 2's
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:45:19 you have 1 motor 2 Per turning piece
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:45:34 or 1 M2M setup
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:47:04 Anyway
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:47:12 You can try that
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:47:15 if you want
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:49:34 I know 1 tip
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:49:38 that should work
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:52:06 here is something that removes M2M stress almost 80% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:52:14 it completely removes the weight and leverage
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:52:20 2 locked motors and disconnectors

the-dump 2023-01-03 10:08:32 It doesn't matter whether or not he isn't doing it anymore
the-dump 2023-01-03 10:08:43 The whole reason for the exposure was for the consequences
the-dump 2023-01-03 10:08:47 Because he never got them
general 2023-01-03 10:09:25 Look at the dump rq

general 2023-01-03 10:12:29 Tl;Dr, he goes on a rant saying that he won't do it anymore
general 2023-01-03 10:12:33 He still did it.
general 2023-01-03 10:12:47 He still deserves consequences for his actions.
general 2023-01-03 10:13:56 His apology was quick and meaningless, it just shows he isn't sorry
general 2023-01-03 10:14:54 Yeah and I'm addressing it now because now he's trying to defend himself.

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:01:14 Lower-mid ranks
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:01:19 Just focus on a lot of shredder shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:01:22 High ranks
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:01:24 tech galore
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:00 a thousand
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:04 that'd be like
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:06 a lot
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:08 of CSA shreds
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:12 you would see one in every server
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:03:18 no we're a few hundred in count
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:17 depends
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:23 void is our BIGGEST breakthrough
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:28 but our most IMPORTANT was rods
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:50 
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:53 little spinny things of death
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:06:59 Like the creator of void and core
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:07:08 or the person who heard about it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:07:15 Not even in CSA
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:07:18 his user is toutou03
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:07:31 01_Rahal was the guy who informed us about it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:07:49 01_Rahal has possibly been credited in a video
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:03 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:07 less so for spaceships
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:08 more so
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:11 for the Void machine
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:14 and charry's ball drones
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:29 toutou's ultimate creation basically
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:08:39 imagine all the tech in the game packed into the most efficient vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:04 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:10 thats charry's ball drone
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:11 leme see
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:13 1 sec
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:30 that thing?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:54 if it that
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:09:56 its charry's ball drone
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:10:46 not really
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:10:48 check unicodes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:13:18 ey su
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:13:22 come back to CSA rq
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:13:27 verification opened back up
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:14 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/1061481077765587096/Ultra_Bug-compressed.mp4
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:26 thats just
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:29 CSA's very first step
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:32 into the tech community
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:38 the void machine is far
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:39 far
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:41 different
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:47 that thing was made 4 years ago
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:14:52 about 3 weeks after old kampfer was made
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:04 lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:14 even then when rods were unrefined
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:18 it just shot mechs
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:20 at mach speeds
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:26 even the large ones
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:29 nowadays
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:34 a rod touches a mech?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:38 Where did the mech go
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:39 ayo tf
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:51 to find it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:53 to pass verification
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:16:57 to be trusted
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:00 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:14 Aight ill send you a new one
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:21 as long as you got the time
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:35 I basically have to take a search
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:38 through everything about you
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:39 your builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:41 your affiliates
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:43 your friends
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:45 your groups
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:55 be with us for over a month and contribute to something
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:18:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:18:30 if you see rare screenshots of CSA chats
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:18:33 you may see
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:18:38 (Raids Won: **)
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:08 lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:11 imagine if UNCF
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:17 actually wasn't a bitch
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:22 and made armies using their tech instead
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:38 and using one of the most efficient builds possible in the game (shredders)
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:47 you kinda start to notice after a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:19:54 y'all have to put much more effort into building and skill
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:20:02 to take down a shredder with lower build effort and less skill
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:20:11 it's called efficiency boys
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:20:44 we kick you after about 12 hours of inactivity
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:21:05 though we're looking into making it 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:21:45 there's a fucking scp group? üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:07 no we just dont trust people to not photoshop shit and lie to us
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:14 And here's how the thing works
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:21 I go to school, get out go to my job
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:24 i get back
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:27 and i have about 3 hours
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:29 to do shit'
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:22:32 thats when verif opens
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:17 meh
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:19 you'll learn quickly
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:23 its not hard to contribute
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:37 you find a CSA link
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:40 you can get in
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:46 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:53 I remember doing 9-5
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:23:55 it was pain
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:24:07 gl on your job btw
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:23:27 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/1061481077765587096/Ultra_Bug-compressed.mp4
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:23:49 
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:23:53 its short for
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:23:55 Orbital rods
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:23 me when point mouse up:
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:44 not CSA's shreds
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:51 though to be fair
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:54 they are a rare species
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:58 99% of shredders will just
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:24:59 die

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:26:03 guyz
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:26:11 i am actotooly 8 yrz old!1!!
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:26:17 :DDDD
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:26:31 confrimd by miglife
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:29:25 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:29:35 Very unlikely unless you're using ANO tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:29:53 Hyper maneuverable jet tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:30:02 core fixes weight issues
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:30:13 it does not fix the force of glitching motors going mach speeds
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:30:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:30:37 common misconception: CSA is not just a shredder group
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:30:45 actually the majority is just free builders
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:02 if you wanna just add more weapons to your jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:04 then do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:14 not very hard
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:30 its kept to groups like UNCF and CSA
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:47 if the public had it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:19 Rod will just make your jet fly around like some sort of crazy spam build
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:26 you notice on every build that has rod
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:31 that its either large and stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:34 or full of tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:51 oh it would just die
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:09 no i mean the community
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:13 it would just die
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:25 core has this affect of making every build its put on insanely powerful
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:34 but equally as strong as other core vehicles
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:42 there'd be no need for innovation
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:47 just
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:51 place core on some random spam plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:02 and you're keeping up with these insanely overengineered jets
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:16 adding the core itself?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:17 No
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:20 following the rules?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:22 FUCK YEAH
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:43 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:48 making it have a full effect
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:51 and actually do something
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:57 Core is the catalyst
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:35:03 you still need to make ur vehicle able to use its effects
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:35:25 depends
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:35:56 Maybe
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:06 a lot of shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:15 Got that
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:23 uhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:28 core surge force axis
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:33 null tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:44 not void
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:36:46 void requires cam lockx
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:37:12 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:37:13 off i go
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:37:15 things to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:51:08 sans when he's on his 10320349230489th phase and is just a flying carbon atom:
I tried to be nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:14 it can lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:18 with a lot of
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:20 funny shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:30 though its not worth the effort
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:26:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:26:27 you just said it couldn't
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:26:32 i said it could
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:26:35 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:27:30 you could do some funny shit with cameras and pistons
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:27:55 Worth the effort
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:08 Also worth the effort]
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:20 though i gotta point out the cam locks biggest annoyance ***For me***
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:23 Its fucking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:24 half block
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:28 forward shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:31 it drives me insane
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:48 magnet lock just keeps the state of blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:51 doesn't lock on its own
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:28:58 You still need something to lock it to begin with'
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:29:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:29:38 magnet lock just gives you the ability to retain all of ur motor lock shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:29:40 with just 1 magnet
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:29:46 instead of a super heavy motor lock array
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:05 yes and no
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:11 1 sec
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:11 funny things
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdTANglZ2oQ
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:46 but back to my hate with cam lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:51 the fucking half block indent
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:53 I can't with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:58 IT DRIVES ME INSANE
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:31:38 it basically goes on for a long while showing you how it works
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:31:43 the actual explanation and tut are like
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:31:46 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:33:27 i want to screenshot this so bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:33:50 bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:33:55 motor set to lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:33:56 go brr
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:00 not hard
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:14 motor locking just brings parts together
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:18 thats like
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:21 60% angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:36 that car
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:38 is just like
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:34:42 mostly angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:10 its
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:11 and not
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:11 simple
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:20 to get it working yeah its simple
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:24 to understand How to get it working
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:26 meh
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:28 requires effort
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:33 not too much effort
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:37:51 angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:38:02 Motor locking =/= Angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:38:24 they're similar but do not have the same purpose
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:38:38 nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:38:38 oh it does?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:04:05 if they had 0 weight then they wouldn't fall
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:04:18 (they fall)
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:04:39 I'll test rq
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:07:23 its lighter than an ice trapdoor/Wooden trail
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:08:49 its now to my knowledge
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:08:53 the lightest block
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:09:06 also the least laggy
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:09:07 No decals
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:09:10 no shaders
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:09:12 no rendering
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:09:15 it just goes invis
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:11:20 nvm
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:11:22 as light as a sign
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:11:40 wait nvm
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:11:43 lighter than a sign
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:11:50 forgot to unpower the motor for a sec
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:12:09 Its as light
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:12:12 as a 1x1 text
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:12:16 so 1x1 text and camera
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:19:18 
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:19:23 Still not as heavy as the block yet
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:20 the block is still heavier
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:42 oh ik then
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:48 if they have 0 weight
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:51 theystill have
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:53 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:23:57 perfect gyro block
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:07 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:12 the weight is 0
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:25 but gravity
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:28 is still there
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:32 and its still a block count
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:43 as u just said
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:24:48 the block is heavier
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:25:35 nonon
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:25:38 when its loaded
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:25:42 block is heavier
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:25:43 still
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:26:06 
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:26:22 OHH WAIT A SEC
I HAVE A FUNNY IDEA
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:26:25 OHOHOH
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:26:32 compared to cameras
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:26:34 Yes yes it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:03 i wanna caculate plane crazies gravity pull
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:09 i already know what a block is Made of
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:11 due to the wiki
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:17 aluminium
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:22 i know the density of aluminium
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:31 I know that the block is 2.5x2.5x2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:27:54 
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:03 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:14 1 stud is 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:30 each block
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:33 is .7 meters long
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:35 not 1 meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:49 also
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:28:55 this info is further backed up
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:29:02 if you dont trust the credibility of roblox itself
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:29:03 that
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:29:12 a player is 5 studs long
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:30:13 do ze math
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:30:47 4.5 foot
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:31:12 which does make a lot of sense
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:31:16 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:31:23 time to do calculation stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:31:30 if i can find the gravitational pull
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:31:32 of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:32:01 find its effect on the amount of aluminum (2.29658793 feet on all edges) by doing density and volume stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:32:19 and ect
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:32:21 I can find
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:32:43 the gravitational pull, the official weight of a block, the length of a block, and ect
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:32:53 its basic math you learn in middle school
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:33:18 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:33:35 pretty sure i learned how to caculate gravitational pull and density shit in middle school
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:33:48 people are mad
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:33:51 ‚òï
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:34:00 I did not make a grammar mistake.

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:05:17 he didn't just get his vid taken down byt he kaddins
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:05:22 ***The kaddins got him banned***
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:20 core tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:21 got leaked
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:28 i had the kaddins take down his tut
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:39 thats why we're being all private
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:45 core tech itself is kept secret
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:06:49 AND IM KEEPING IT THAT WAY
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:07:18 from toutou himself
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:07:22 Core tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:07:28 is kept under lock and chain now
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:08:05 simple explanation
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:08:55 better explanation from a guy who works with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:03 allows you to control the games physics engine
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:07 and do some funky shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:13 the weight reduction and inertia stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:14 is like
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:15 basline
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:18 its guaranteed
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:23 even if you follow none of the rules
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:29 you'll always get that
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:32 but with actual core
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:34 all physics shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:09:37 is in your control
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:10:08 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:10:36 lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:12:41 BLACK!

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:18:03 send me his channel
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:19:13 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:20:47 i dont even care if you did
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:00 i managed to snag his vid on an mp4 before his channel went byebye
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:10 turns out he didn't even do anything with core right
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:14 he failed activation 100%
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:18 he followed no rules
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:23 the only reason there was 0 grav
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:31 was because the 3 disconnector + 2 motor2 glitch
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:39 its a common block weld glitch
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:54 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:24:56 
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:16 the same exact effect you notice on His vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:31 Makes everything 0 grav
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:33 but 1 singular block
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:38 the closest to the disconnect point
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:45 actually has a higher Gravitational pull
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:52 thus you notice when im spinning it around
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:26:57 its pulling on 1 block
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:01 despite being 0 grav
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:20 could be used for some belkan tomfoolery
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:23 i could honestly care less
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:40 but you notice
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:47 the same exact effect he had <:think:876183751921643520>
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:27:57 its because his thing was literally just
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:01 him failing to use core
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:02 in every way
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:11 and miraculously making another tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:42 bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:49 we got the youtube coordinater
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:50 for CSA
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:55 on his ass
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:28:57 we weren't havin it
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:13 I mean

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:19 adding you 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:24 to the ANO group
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:34 though
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:35 to be fair
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:40 we're going to have to make a server now
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:32:43 the group DM is now filled
general 2023-01-09 01:19:15 clear joke
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:25:22 
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:25:27 He admitted to me too
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:25:34 but he also deleted his messages
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:25:41 but i snagged this ss before he deleted this too
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:26:00 he assumed there is other 12 year olds in CSA because he was 12
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:26:07 truly a moment of all time
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:27:45 
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:07 He willingly left
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:10 not denying he was 12
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:15 he just agreed to the terms
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:18 proving he was indeed 12
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:29 yeah
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:28:35 he shouldn't have beent here to begin with though
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:29:06 indeed
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:29:42 it shows a Growth of maturity from a certain point of time
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:29:50 but that certain point of time sadly wasn't when he joined CSA
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:29:55 if he had maturity beforehand
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:30:01 he would have just waited
the-dump 2023-01-09 04:31:13 ima go walk me dog

general 2023-01-10 02:45:34 unlike just 1 model AkA a block
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 04:58:31 Self protection on cutters being the most useless configuration in the entire game:
the-dump 2023-01-12 14:44:33 It's a story

general 2023-01-15 13:22:12 It's uncommon to shoot through the barrel of the tank gun but it isn't impossible
general 2023-01-15 13:22:34 Though I don't see how a spontaneously exploding tank wins a battle
general 2023-01-15 13:22:56 Oh ok
general 2023-01-15 13:23:07 Sorry

plane-crazy 2023-01-22 05:59:16 here's a quote from my friend in a different group called the warp league
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:00:29 like how the recent update a month or 2 ago broke void tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:00:33 we only fixed it this week
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:00:49 void that has tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:00:56 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:01:16 bubble
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:01:59 the update that broke void 2 months ago was said to "fix entity animation" and "improve performance", while infact the entities shit themselves like in void and the performance has dropped as a new double checking system was added, further dropping FPS

general 2023-01-26 08:27:52 Pretty sure you didn't make the first shredder bud
general 2023-01-26 08:28:21 There was no "copies"
general 2023-01-26 08:28:27 It was a tutorial
general 2023-01-26 08:29:00 Are you exilir8 <@768307705177178143>
general 2023-01-26 08:30:26 Smiley
general 2023-01-26 08:30:32 Has a point
general 2023-01-26 08:30:34 Lmfao
general 2023-01-26 08:30:38 anyway
general 2023-01-26 08:30:54 The first shredder bug tutorial to ever pop up was exilir8's
general 2023-01-26 08:31:06 Give me an exact date
general 2023-01-26 08:31:20 Crazy
general 2023-01-26 08:31:31 The first tutorial was early 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:31:33 EARLY
general 2023-01-26 08:32:04 It was deleted tho
general 2023-01-26 08:32:18 Due to the hate and backlash
general 2023-01-26 08:32:33 Exilir8's video is prob on the way back machine though
general 2023-01-26 08:33:07 I gave exilir8 the idea and he posted a tut on it
general 2023-01-26 08:33:31 I thought it would be used as a reusable missile
general 2023-01-26 08:33:43 What the fuck are you talking about
general 2023-01-26 08:34:06 Don't be a smart ass
general 2023-01-26 08:34:22 Motor 2 did exist early 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:34:24 Lmfao
general 2023-01-26 08:34:37 Yeah
general 2023-01-26 08:34:39 It did
general 2023-01-26 08:37:17 That was fairly early
general 2023-01-26 08:37:38 8th month of 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:37:53 It's early/mid
general 2023-01-26 08:38:00 More in the middle
general 2023-01-26 08:38:40 Again
general 2023-01-26 08:38:53 January is like the exact middle
general 2023-01-26 08:39:03 It's still closer to mid 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:39:32 Though, shredders were released november
general 2023-01-26 08:39:40 Motor 2 was in october
general 2023-01-26 08:39:50 Dropped only a month after motor 2 did
general 2023-01-26 08:40:25 Even if you made a shredder earlier
general 2023-01-26 08:40:29 You made no tutorial
general 2023-01-26 08:40:44 And no one copied you because me and exilir8 had our own seperate idea
general 2023-01-26 08:43:33 Yeah no exilir8's tut is on wayback
general 2023-01-26 08:43:44 The original one, not the one that blew up like crazy
general 2023-01-26 08:43:50 It was late November
general 2023-01-26 08:44:36 I said early 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:44:51 Motor 2 dropped October, official patch and use was November
general 2023-01-26 08:45:06 So it dropped basically mid 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:45:14 You debunked 2 things
general 2023-01-26 08:45:19 Early 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:45:41 I thought it was somewhere near January
general 2023-01-26 08:45:45 False memory
general 2023-01-26 08:45:51 It was October
general 2023-01-26 08:45:57 More mid
general 2023-01-26 08:46:27 Actually he didn't even debunk 2 things
general 2023-01-26 08:46:54 I said early 2019, was debunked (I forgor) it was mid 2019
general 2023-01-26 08:47:40 I'ma quote that rq
general 2023-01-26 08:47:45 Or speech bubble it
general 2023-01-26 08:47:51 "After I kept debunking you"
general 2023-01-26 08:47:58 ü§ì

general 2023-01-26 08:55:08 I was never flexing it but ok
general 2023-01-26 08:55:45 Saying I'm going back to work is a flex?

plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:32:00 Dumbass-
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:32:18 We're trying to not leak that for a reason y'know
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:32:44 Cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:32:58 Can you not leak game breaking tech?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:33:26 Because it's going to ruin the community
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:33:39 We're not going to
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:33:46 I'm kindly asking you to delete it
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:34:09 You want all Roblox building games dead?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:04 Oh no guys
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:18 An already public wireless engine has been made public again!
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:20 Unfortunate
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:24 The world's ending
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:28 Kiu I'll tell you later
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:39 Can you not though
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:36:52 You're jeopardizing Roblox here
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:37:11 You can get in **legal** trouble for this
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:37:25 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:37:47 You're literally leaking something that has the ability to take down a huge portion of Roblox permanently
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:03 Not only is it a terrorist attack but it's going to get you sued by Roblox
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:20 I suggest you delete it
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:29 For your own sake
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:45 Kiu again
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:47 I'll explain
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:38:49 Later
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:39:28 Oh pretty please delete core tech hgg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:39:56 Anyway sci and kiu
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:40:08 I'll make a group dm in a minute and explain things
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:41:52 (core has the ability to manipulate/delete Roblox code, in buildings games If an entity block junction exists, core can and thus you can fuck with the games code)
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:42:01 If I'm taking it seriously
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:42:04 It's because it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:42:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:42:46 Ok feel free
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:43:18 Don't threaten that
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:44:20 Because entity block junctions give the pathway to do whatever you want if you break them, basically of you activate core you actively open a tear in the security
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:09 Weld points between an entity and a block
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:43 Not that
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:45:57 Breaking the weld gives you the ability to fuck with it if you know what you're doing
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:47:02 If a certain someone starts leaking all of the tech and components in a certain PCC per say
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:47:13 ***cough*** lynxam
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:03 Toutou just works with Roblox and understands how it all works hgg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:48:44 How is Roblox code changeable through abuse of Roblox code
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:49:09 I'm not explaining this here anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:49:19 You can figure this out in your own free time
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:49:43 Yeah he's been for a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:50:16 Been in computer programming for multiple years, and I have an inject tool to view roblox's code
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:50:23 It does infact, sound bull
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:50:32 But it works through manipulating a certain function
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:50:59 Anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:51:06 Sci, you can learn it in your free time
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:51:27 You clearly want this to be a public thing so I'm not at all inclined to give you shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:52:00 You got the space role
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:52:06 I'm assuming you know about UNCF
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:52:22 Could kill the community entirely if it's leaked
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:52:43 Know how nam jets and shredders have lowered the player count from the hundreds of thousands to barely 3k now?
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:04 No
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:13 It has
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:36 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:47 It was egg hunt time and pre shred times
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:53:59 Brief periods where the average player count was around 100k
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:54:12 No lynx
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:54:40 You're not pro for owning a piece of tech that gives you an unfair advantage over others
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:54:52 Also gjsolo and nam are just reg jet users
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:55:16 I'd say they're a bit more experienced and a bit more fearless due to cockiness
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:55:32 But when dueling then the only thing I noticed was they didn't run like all other jets
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:55:36 No hg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:55:56 They're above average jet users that are YouTubers
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:56:15 Why add core tech if you're going to just add a physics mod anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:57:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:57:37 It allows you to control the physics engine entirely as a baseline
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:57:52 Use specific tools though and you can basically use core as an inject
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:57:57 That's what I mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:04 It's literally just a vantage point
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:21 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:31 Think exploiting except it's not client sided
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:58:34 Everyone sees it
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:59:00 Fun fact:
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:59:02 We don't
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:59:19 None of your concern
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 11:59:45 Pretty sure jannu is the only one with scripts
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:00:47 That's called a color picking algorithm
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:00:57 Learn how to code for more than 4 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:01:01 And you'll understand how
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:01:38 Fun fact, you don't need to if you don't have a skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:01:46 Just get good at motor locking and angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:02:24 No daily he wants something thats like an aimbot but for specific color codes
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:02:27 AkA
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:02:38 Color picking algorithm
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:03:04 Explaining what it does means nothing
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:03:16 For all I could say is it could idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:03:37 Sentient dix flying at Mach 5
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:06 We simply use it for making fun aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:19 Sutart
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:26 Don't tell lynxam anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:33 Seriously he's just going to leak it
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:37 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:47 Core tech has been found in other games
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:04:51 But we don't use it there
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:05:06 We're keeping ourselves to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:05:08 Cuz it's fun
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:06:12 Hgg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:06:22 We aren't giving you shit anymore because you just leaked shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:06:28 <:thebeastisdemonicinnature:1052128719717793823>
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:06:37 I just said why
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:07:15 Cool you go do that hg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:07:25 Cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:07:34 Fun fact exploit injects are client sided
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:07:43 They do literally nothing
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:10:19 You shouldn't have leaked tech to begin with
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:10:31 Cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:10:36 That doesn't justify it
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:11:25 Because it literally has the ability to fuck with Roblox code in games that can load core
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:11:27 AkA
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:11:52 You just released a damaging exploit into the wild that can endanger a multi billion dollar company
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:11:59 Hello gonk
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:12:09 Autocorrect
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:12:15 Anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:12:40 You can only ruin Roblox building games, otherwise the rest of Roblox is fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:13:48 <:spook:905430441660657704>
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:26:11 No we don't
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:26:21 Better term, jannu uses hacks
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:26:50 Ok so now not only can I not trust giving you anything, I don't trust anything you say
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:27:02 Also I believe hg is an unde too
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:27:03 Istg
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:27:20 <@573970670854340628>
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:27:22 Unde check
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:27:53 Yousuf and puri are dead golden
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:28:08 Ah the homework check
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:28:16 I remember when they did that to me
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:29:09 By getting into CSA and stealing our shit without our permission
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:29:45 To be fair though gonk
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:29:51 Only images of the Core exist
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:29:57 Almost nothing exists if it's configs
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:30:04 Let alone the rules of core tech
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:31:34 I swear where is techmaster when you need him
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:32:15 It was a rhetorical question
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:32:59 (lynx going online to search what rhetorical means because they're an unde and don't understand)
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:34:15 Hg you aren't funny
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:34:39 Then stop harassing Yousuf
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:34:47 They did nothing to you
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 12:34:51 Leave them alone
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 03:43:51 Hello
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 04:24:40 Why'd you ping me <@313071537894719488>

the-dump 2023-01-28 07:32:52 Apparently my old one
the-dump 2023-01-28 07:33:09 There was calc, algebra, and geom
the-dump 2023-01-28 07:33:18 Into different subjects

the-dump 2023-01-30 23:01:28 Dust Tale sans or edgetale
the-dump 2023-01-31 06:42:14 There was a Roblox physics update so a lot of entity shit is screwed, but some stable conveyor engines still work
the-dump 2023-01-31 06:48:19 Slightly older
the-dump 2023-01-31 06:48:24 Like a few months ago
the-dump 2023-01-31 06:50:06 12/02/2022
the-dump 2023-01-31 06:50:33 It was a secret drop that silently screwed entities Roblox wide and further unoptimized fps
the-dump 2023-02-01 05:58:19 It has been such a long time since a bait here
the-dump 2023-02-01 05:58:31 I clicked on it expecting to watch another furry video
the-dump 2023-02-01 05:58:37 I was so happy sam showed up
the-dump 2023-02-01 05:58:43 And then he just got stabbed....
the-dump 2023-02-01 05:59:07 
the-dump 2023-02-01 06:00:01 Mf tried turning super Saiyan at 0:11

the-dump 2023-02-01 06:00:46 HOOOO
the-dump 2023-02-01 06:00:50 HOOWOOO??
the-dump 2023-02-01 06:03:45 Same
the-dump 2023-02-01 06:03:52 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-02-02 03:53:17 You don't exist
the-dump 2023-02-02 03:53:26 Thus no one cares
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 05:53:38 Long long time ago
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 05:53:43 No one uses it though
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 05:53:57 Literally just a block with modifiable friction
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 17:21:03 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-02-04 17:47:49 Freak you guys like what the hay!!!!
general 2023-02-04 17:47:57 mommy told me not to swear...
general 2023-02-04 18:53:16 <@907408760253857812>
general 2023-02-04 18:53:24 i like how you're talking shit about us under the new posts
general 2023-02-04 22:07:00 hey <@896705884628062219>
general 2023-02-04 22:07:17 better name
general 2023-02-04 22:07:20 mango j'
general 2023-02-04 23:31:53 nvm
general 2023-02-05 02:44:56 ladies and gentlemen
general 2023-02-05 02:45:07 i have calculated the weight of a density 1 ballast in plane crazy
general 2023-02-05 02:45:40 a density 1 ballast floats in water
general 2023-02-05 02:45:44 meaning its as dense as water
general 2023-02-05 02:45:50 a block is 2.5 studs in length
general 2023-02-05 02:45:53 AkA 0.7 meters
general 2023-02-05 02:45:55 do the math
general 2023-02-05 02:46:10 343 kilograms
general 2023-02-05 02:46:14 or 756 pounds
general 2023-02-05 02:46:21 density 1 ballast = 756 pounds irl
general 2023-02-05 02:46:50 a default block is 0.28 density
general 2023-02-05 02:46:54 so just divide to find that
general 2023-02-05 02:47:15 nearly 0.4 US tons
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 10:22:13 Why was I pinged
the-dump 2023-02-09 23:34:58 
general 2023-02-17 02:07:30 Bro y'all are playing on ipad???
general 2023-02-17 02:07:38 I'm playing on my smart fridge
general 2023-02-17 02:08:49 Some PCs
general 2023-02-17 02:08:59 The high end PCs are going into the tens of thousands of dollars
general 2023-03-01 21:40:48 Ok
general 2023-03-01 21:41:31 I'm getting on my PC rn
general 2023-03-01 21:41:35 I'm sending a screenshot
general 2023-03-01 21:44:28 My pc won't turn on
general 2023-03-01 21:44:31 Plus I'm busy
general 2023-03-01 21:44:39 I'll be back in about 20 minutes
general 2023-03-01 21:44:50 Ah what year u started?
general 2023-03-01 21:45:39 I started 2018
general 2023-03-01 21:45:45 Been playing a shit ton tho
general 2023-03-01 21:45:52 Also I got the screenshot, went on mobile
general 2023-03-01 21:46:06 Lol
general 2023-03-01 21:46:19 I just pulled all nighters and played for 10 hours
general 2023-03-01 21:46:25 I didn't care about making content
general 2023-03-01 21:46:30 <#495286269459300364>
the-dump 2023-03-01 21:46:46 Bruh
the-dump 2023-03-01 21:46:48 
the-dump 2023-03-01 21:46:55 Now it finally loaded
the-dump 2023-03-01 21:47:24 <@456226577798135808>
general 2023-03-01 21:48:17 Anyway if you don't mind me
general 2023-03-01 21:48:21 I'm going back to work
general 2023-03-01 21:48:37 I already did
general 2023-03-01 21:48:41 Pinged u in the dump
general 2023-03-01 21:49:18 I don't afk much
general 2023-03-01 21:49:24 If I do I just log out
general 2023-03-01 21:49:55 It depends on consistency
general 2023-03-01 21:50:28 That's basically what I average
general 2023-03-01 21:50:37 Yes, I spend a lot of time playing
general 2023-03-01 21:51:09 But I retired last week because 1, I got a life 2, I've explored everything the game has to offer
general 2023-03-01 21:51:19 I've been to almost every PCMG, gotten all the tech
general 2023-03-01 21:51:25 I even got dex script viewer
general 2023-03-01 21:51:36 And made a GUI with the code if everything in the game
general 2023-03-01 21:52:09 Void tech has yet to be leaked, but it is often rumored
general 2023-03-01 21:52:36 If you haven't heard of void tech then have you heard of core tech?
general 2023-03-01 21:52:59 It's hidden, just it's design isn't
general 2023-03-01 21:53:14 There's certain rules to building it properly that maximizes it's effects
general 2023-03-01 21:53:23 Only about 4 ppl know how to properly use a core
general 2023-03-01 21:53:37 The core itself, has been leaked hundreds of times over
general 2023-03-01 21:53:43 Also clipping tech is awesome
general 2023-03-01 21:53:50 Which version you use
general 2023-03-01 21:54:00 Water storage or Motor 2 glitch
general 2023-03-01 21:54:10 Ah
general 2023-03-01 21:54:19 Those 2 are the most consistent
general 2023-03-01 21:54:22 That I'm aware of
general 2023-03-01 21:54:41 Me too but it's a bit complicated
general 2023-03-01 21:54:51 You ever heard of DSG and DTG
general 2023-03-01 21:55:14 Data save glitch and data transfer glitch
general 2023-03-01 21:55:54 Data save glitch uses water storage to permanently save the current state of your vehicle in the code
general 2023-03-01 21:56:25 If you get damaged, the game still thinks you are still in the perfect state
general 2023-03-01 21:56:50 And no I don't mean ghosting
general 2023-03-01 21:57:25 Ghosting isn't even tech
general 2023-03-01 21:57:34 It's just the game failing to register damage
general 2023-03-01 21:57:43 Unless you mean cloaking mk1
general 2023-03-01 21:58:25 Ghosting is what happens when the yellow gun beams hit another person
general 2023-03-01 21:58:31 It appears damaged but isn't actually
general 2023-03-01 21:58:53 Cloaking is the device that uses half pistons to store your location via anchor until you unanchor
general 2023-03-01 21:59:20 AkA the "teleportation glitch"
general 2023-03-01 21:59:58 Ye but it's inconsistent because the player avatar
general 2023-03-01 22:03:50 Yeah
general 2023-03-01 22:03:59 Tip for actual no collision
general 2023-03-01 22:04:06 Look into clientside glitches
general 2023-03-01 22:17:50 Meh
general 2023-03-01 22:17:58 Its a way to get true clipping
general 2023-03-01 22:18:01 Anyway
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:00:05 suspension + helium
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:00:11 keeps vehicles upright
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:00:21 you see it used in those landsharks constantly
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:00:29 axis lock however,
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:00:38 I cant teach u that
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:01:39 
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:01:50 like this hall of fame shark
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:06:54 just use motor locking
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:07:02 and use texts
general 2023-03-04 23:03:20 Queerleer!!!!
general 2023-03-11 23:30:59 i have an interesting idea
general 2023-03-11 23:31:12 using toggle pistons
general 2023-03-11 23:31:23 technically i can create a computer
general 2023-03-11 23:31:25 in plane crazy
general 2023-03-11 23:31:34 though its function will be limited
general 2023-03-12 07:41:41 thats flightpoint
general 2023-03-12 07:56:12 hi queerleer
general 2023-03-16 01:16:18 I've come to the most toxic place I can
general 2023-03-16 01:16:36 Does anyone have the nerd emoji mp4
general 2023-03-16 01:16:41 I need it
general 2023-03-16 01:16:46 Direly
general 2023-03-16 01:17:58 C'mon guys it's just one "ü§ì"
general 2023-03-16 01:18:03 I need the mp4
general 2023-03-16 02:17:35 Quiet Roblox update that screwed with how the outside world physics affects entities
general 2023-03-16 02:17:57 Essentially
general 2023-03-16 02:18:10 Any motors with wing panels or rockets will now shit themselves
general 2023-03-16 02:18:54 Ask Roblox and their shitty dev team why they thought this was a good idea
general 2023-03-16 02:21:25 fix for this new roblox update:
general 2023-03-16 02:21:38 basically if enough counterforce is applied to entities they will shit themselves
general 2023-03-16 02:21:45 the fix is to add counter-counter force of your own
general 2023-03-16 02:21:49 just tested, it works
general 2023-03-16 02:21:53 bit hard to tune it
general 2023-03-16 02:22:23 ong
general 2023-03-16 02:23:56 the last roblox update added weight to entities
general 2023-03-16 02:24:06 this one added the physics it calculates for the players
general 2023-03-16 02:24:21 basically, it applies its own drag and lift
general 2023-03-16 02:24:25 Roblox's version,
general 2023-03-16 02:24:28 not rickje's
general 2023-03-16 02:24:41 essentially he made PC motors shit themselves
general 2023-03-16 02:24:57 the fix is to literally apply an opposite force equal to that of the one thats applied
general 2023-03-16 02:25:22 may work
general 2023-03-16 02:25:23 may not
general 2023-03-16 02:25:39 i cannot test because i went to play at a concert and some little kids gave me HF&M
general 2023-03-16 02:25:53 i can no longer use my fingers on a keyboard without searing pain and itching

general 2023-03-16 02:42:18 namshits are still an issue
general 2023-03-16 02:42:25 their propeller "post stall"
general 2023-03-16 02:42:26 aka
general 2023-03-16 02:42:30 m2m nams are gone
general 2023-03-16 02:42:34 Wasd nams are going to rise
general 2023-03-16 02:44:16 why does queerleer have santr hat
general 2023-03-16 12:58:21 stop stalking me
general 2023-03-16 12:58:25 im just trying to relax
general 2023-03-16 12:58:33 let me chill in the water
general 2023-03-16 12:58:44 you're taking pictures of me
general 2023-03-16 12:58:45 weirdo
general 2023-03-16 12:59:03 smh
general 2023-03-16 14:34:07 ^
general 2023-03-16 14:34:15 roblox phyiscs update changes entities again
general 2023-03-16 14:34:27 they added their own lift and drag system to every roblox game
general 2023-03-16 14:34:32 AkA
general 2023-03-16 14:34:43 a system rickje's motor 2's didn't use and wasn't coded in
general 2023-03-16 14:34:44 so now
general 2023-03-16 14:34:46 its fucked
general 2023-03-16 14:35:01 that was an option
general 2023-03-16 14:35:04 before this update
general 2023-03-16 14:35:29 i actually built a shred rq to demonstrate the effect of this roblox applied lift
general 2023-03-16 14:35:34 leme upload it to streamable rq
general 2023-03-16 14:36:24 this is the definition of "riches to rags"
general 2023-03-16 14:36:52 https://streamable.com/l46wl6
general 2023-03-16 14:36:59 here's the demonstration i created
general 2023-03-16 14:37:04 as you see on the 4 main arms
general 2023-03-16 14:37:16 the Lift is applied equally determined by the angle of which the force is applied
general 2023-03-16 14:37:22 AkA, actual lift unlike rickje's version
general 2023-03-16 14:38:26 however
general 2023-03-16 14:38:29 the arms that have no angle
general 2023-03-16 14:38:34 remain Locked in position
general 2023-03-16 14:38:40 due to the lift on both ends being equal
general 2023-03-16 14:38:45 overriding the torque of the motor 2
general 2023-03-16 14:39:48 so
general 2023-03-16 14:39:53 thats the reason motor 2's are broken
general 2023-03-16 14:39:58 please, stop talking about it
general 2023-03-16 14:40:11 switch to propeller WASD or tech equivalents
general 2023-03-16 14:40:20 if anyone else asks
general 2023-03-16 14:40:24 REPLY TO THIS
general 2023-03-16 14:41:47 i just explained
general 2023-03-16 14:41:51 watch the streamable
general 2023-03-16 14:42:50 yeah
general 2023-03-16 14:42:58 roblox implemented a new physics system for entities
general 2023-03-16 14:43:02 so actually
general 2023-03-16 14:43:09 Most free floating entities LIKE motor 2's
general 2023-03-16 14:43:13 are screwed
general 2023-03-16 14:43:17 i say most because some lock
general 2023-03-16 14:43:25 ^^^^^
general 2023-03-16 14:43:34 the force gets less extreme the less speed you have
general 2023-03-16 14:44:03 Summary
general 2023-03-16 14:45:36 Roblox added a new physics system that has an entirely different drag lift inertia and force system for entities, The reason your motor 2's are broken is that they're so weak they can't handle it, the force applied from the new lift system completely shits on it. Some other free-floating entities are fucked over too, can't think of a good example but I'm sure you'll notice it.
general 2023-03-16 14:45:40 Thats the summary
general 2023-03-16 14:45:43 im out
general 2023-03-16 14:46:04 and was i talking to you?
general 2023-03-16 14:46:21 if you have a problem with people talking
general 2023-03-16 14:46:26 there's this useful invention called
general 2023-03-16 14:46:27 "dms"
general 2023-03-16 14:46:42 so instead of complaining that people are talking in a public chat
general 2023-03-16 14:46:54 grow up from your manbaby like state and just message them, or get over it
general 2023-03-16 14:47:46 yeah
general 2023-03-16 14:47:50 checked with dex script viewer
general 2023-03-16 14:47:58 new system implemented for how lift works
general 2023-03-16 14:48:03 motor 2's are now shit
general 2023-03-16 14:48:05 üëç
general 2023-03-16 14:48:18 now M2MNamshits are going to go crazy
general 2023-03-16 14:48:26 maybe something good came out of this update
general 2023-03-16 14:48:31 no more m2mNamshits
general 2023-03-16 14:48:51 yes, and no
general 2023-03-16 14:49:01 the original varients will be completely unaffected
general 2023-03-16 14:49:14 they're wings are located on the tail which is dragged along
general 2023-03-16 14:49:18 Omnis however
general 2023-03-16 14:49:25 without axis lock, they're fucked
general 2023-03-16 14:49:27 https://streamable.com/l46wl6
general 2023-03-16 14:49:28 again
general 2023-03-16 14:49:31 look at the streamable
general 2023-03-16 14:49:41 the only reason its flying straight is because the lift is equal on all arms
general 2023-03-16 14:49:49 the second i move my mouse im going to be rolling across the map
general 2023-03-16 14:50:21 only omni bugs
general 2023-03-16 14:50:26 not all omni bugs are fucked tho
general 2023-03-16 14:50:40 axis lock varients are completely fine, original varients are fine
general 2023-03-16 14:50:50 traditional omni bugs tho
general 2023-03-16 14:50:56 may was well go in the garbage
general 2023-03-16 14:51:36 AkA the only omni bugs you're going to see at this point in servers is TCC (Formerly CSA, changed because people thought we were confederate larpers üíÄ
general 2023-03-16 14:52:24 luckily TCC is mostly unnaffected
general 2023-03-16 14:52:32 some mid ranks of ours use traditional omnis
general 2023-03-16 14:52:38 but mostly OG bugs or axis lock omnis
general 2023-03-16 14:54:43 there's nothing in the rules against custom usernames
general 2023-03-16 14:54:52 just says "english only" and "no offensive"
general 2023-03-16 14:55:57 but there's nothing against custom usernames
general 2023-03-16 14:56:02 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-03-16 14:56:18 like
general 2023-03-16 14:56:20 go read the rules
general 2023-03-16 14:56:27 its not there
general 2023-03-16 14:56:34 is
general 2023-03-16 14:56:34 the only things it says
general 2023-03-16 14:56:41 (that i can find related)
general 2023-03-16 14:57:03 (No offensive symbols or terms, No alt accounts, English only)
general 2023-03-16 14:57:15 i dont see anything against symbols
general 2023-03-16 14:57:26 ctrl + c
ctrl + v
general 2023-03-16 14:57:57 ¬≤
general 2023-03-16 14:58:06 lol
general 2023-03-16 14:58:15 could be because you verified him because he was stuck
general 2023-03-16 14:58:19 and the bot wouldn't let him in
general 2023-03-16 14:58:21 or bot glitched
general 2023-03-16 14:58:45 hyperbitch!!!!!
general 2023-03-16 15:08:01 <@866848584888877077>
general 2023-03-16 15:08:06 can you announce this
general 2023-03-16 15:08:07 PLEASE
general 2023-03-16 15:09:58 do you really want people screaming wahh wahh motor 2 broken
general 2023-03-16 15:10:00 over and over
general 2023-03-16 15:13:33 announce the reason motor 2's are broken, and that hyper is down
general 2023-03-16 15:13:39 it will keep the community informed
general 2023-03-16 16:19:35 yes and no
general 2023-03-16 16:19:50 far better, the gui and placement however is SHIT
the-dump 2023-03-17 00:41:59 We have -2 days left to live
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:35:33 What
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:35:46 Where did you get 1 stud is 1 foot
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:36:05 Roblox said themselves that a stud is 0.28 Meters
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:36:14 And a block in plane crazy is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:36:28 Where the hell did y'all get a stud = a foot
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:38:45 There was a blog from a sub-dev making a Roblox game that said a foot was a stud
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:38:55 Roblox never said themselves a stud was a foot
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:39:01 They said it was 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:39:40 It's not a foot though
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:40:02 If you round it calculations go off
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:40:21 Don't round stuff when measuring shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:41:12 Actually players are 5.5 studs tall, r16 avatars are a bit shorter because of a glitch
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:41:47 Wait no, it was 6 studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:01 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:06 Go into plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:12 A vlock is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:24 Place 2 by the side of your head
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:29 The hitbox is 6 studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:35 The visual is 5 or 5.5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:41 Yeah, it is
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:50 Nonono
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:42:55 I am a dev, and second
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:00 Dex script viewer
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:16 If you use it on a plane crazy block and turn rounding off
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:24 "2.5 studs"
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:37 A block in PC is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:45 Yeaj
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:46 Off
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:56 AkA if it had a tenths decimal
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:43:58 It would show
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:44:11 Rounding is off, thus if it shows 2.5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:44:20 It's exactly 2.5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:45:01 If you set your players height to max and switch the regular avatar, it is 6 block hitbox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:46:13 not a dev For roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:46:18 i work on my own games
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:46:29 random experiments
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:46:55 i just make plane crazy copies to be able to mess around with the games code
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:47:07 allows me to see what happens if i mess with certain boxes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:47:12 like turning prismatic off
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:47:22 I said not a roblox dev
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:47:26 AkA i do not work FOR roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:47:35 I make the games ON roblox though
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:05 actually i did
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:07 a few weeks ago
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:11 thats where i got the 5.5 from
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:25 r5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:33 r15 is shorter
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:41 though plane crazy doesn't use r15
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:48:59 i know, i keep slipping lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:06 ragh
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:08 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:18 plane crazies hitbox doesn't change between r5 and r15
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:29 it just changes visual height
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:39 though if you mess with the height settings you can minorly offset it
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:46 so it is on average
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:49:47 5.5
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:50:00 1.54 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:50:20 plane crazy changes the hitboxes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:50:29 you need dex script viewer to view what plane crazy does
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:50:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:50:58 thats what dex script viewer is-
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:13 i use the infinite yield version
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:19 the arguably better one
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:42 they dont give a shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:44 and im retired
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:46 I
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:51:48 dont give a shit either
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:19 you use freecam
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:21 or opencam
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:28 nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:38 roshade isn't really an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:42 it is but isn't
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:51 no one
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:52:52 i assumed
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:53:01 there is about 2 roblox shading versions
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:53:06 with roshade being the most popular
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:53:16 i just met you 10 minutes ago on a slightly active block game
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:53:23 im inclined to believe you have roshade
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:53:29 its shaders for roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:57:46 Again plane crazy changes the heights itself
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:58:04 You again need to exploit to see it yourself
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:59:53 Also that update that silently screwed motor 2's a few days ago also changed hitboxes too
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 02:59:59 So I probably need to test again
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:02 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:06 Purely the hitbox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:16 The players model doesn't truly concern me
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:50 I've been talking about both
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:01:59 Go look back at what I've been talking about
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:02:24 I was taking about hitbox
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:02:38 And second, the hitbox is the players true size
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:02:46 So no it's not irrelevant
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:07 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:48 Yeah I did
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:03:53 Plane crazies isn't very bad
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:04:00 The script outlines it
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:04:05 Though you have a fair point
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 03:04:10 It's not truly perfect
the-dump 2023-03-24 07:04:08 He waited for mods to go asleep and bypass jpeg images of po
the-dump 2023-03-24 07:04:31 This has to have been a planned attack because he knows when the mods went to sleep
the-dump 2023-03-24 07:12:00 <@866848584888877077>
the-dump 2023-03-24 07:12:02 Lollll
general 2023-03-24 07:12:43 One last resort
general 2023-03-24 07:13:01 I ping the man himself
general 2023-03-24 07:13:09 It's worth the consequences
general 2023-03-24 07:13:46 Wait
general 2023-03-24 07:13:52 NO ONES PINGED TECHMASTEE YET
general 2023-03-24 07:14:04 <@573970670854340628>
general 2023-03-24 07:15:46 I should be mod too
general 2023-03-24 07:16:21 Because no one else responded
general 2023-03-24 07:16:28 Was worth a shot
general 2023-03-24 07:16:31 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-03-24 07:16:38 Yes it was
general 2023-03-24 07:20:31 We watch as PCC slowly rots away
general 2023-03-24 07:21:10 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 06:36:42 Ayyy you watched songs of war?
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:29:14 Textures effect the weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:29:55 Ice and fabric are usually the lightest, but on blocks known as "heavy blocks" ice and fabric makes them heavier, some heavy blocks get lightweight when you set them to wood
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:30:32 Ex: trails, delta wings, control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:30:39 All get lighter when set to wood
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:30:46 And get heavier when set to ice
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:30:52 No
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:02 Trapdoors don't get lighter when set to wood
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:10 They're not heavy blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:16 That's why people use ice trapdoors
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:28 Fun fact, the default is the maximum weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:33 Diamond plating and metal
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:36 Aren't heavier
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:31:41 I've tested this too
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:32:03 Default, sand, slate, diamond plating, metal and a few more are all tied for heaviest material
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:32:29 I think tied with default
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:32:34 Or slightly lighter
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:32:50 I absolutely never use glass except for glitched cam view to view through water
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:33:12 First off it's actually proven this method varies on lag
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:33:19 Use unpowered motors as a balance
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:33:26 Not suspension
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:34:02 Suspensions are prismatics, their performance and how they work is heavily based on ping and fps
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:34:11 It can give false positives if you test with it
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:34:30 It's also the reason suspension settings work for 1 person but not another
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:35:03 Motors are motor constraints, they do not vary on ping or lag
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:35:17 So use motor balancing systems
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:35:29 Plus it shows you how much heavier something is from the other
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:35:51 The motors can delay but the results are always the same
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:02 Unlike prismatic variability
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:30 To use a motor balance system
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:40 Build 10 blocks up, place an anchor
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:44 Use an unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:47 Make a beam
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:36:59 Place each block your testing on equal ends of the said beam
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:37:16 The heavier will fall to the bottom, the lighter will go to the top
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:37:28 If it doesn't change at all, it's the same weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:37:45 Also make sure the motor your testing with is unpowered
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:38:06 Or else torque of the motor messes with results and makes it look like ice is as heavy as default
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:39:00 I absolutely hate saying this, but nam made an actual good guide on material science
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:39:10 Despite the rest of the video being mostly dogshit
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:40:57 Prismatics vary because they're effected by ping,delay, and lag
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:03 Suspensions are a prismatic
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:08 It's prismatic variability
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:23 Not explaining, go search it up
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:27 Too lazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:48 https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PrismaticConstraint
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:41:51 Here
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:43:11 PrismaticConstraint < MotorConstraint
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:43:52 The reason core techs named core tech is because it messes with core script
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:44:04 I don't know why they named it CoreScript
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:44:10 But whatever floats their boat

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:44:43 0:35
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:46:04 That's just common knowledge
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:46:32 Stuk you are essentially the rich white man in this situation with weight removing glitches and such
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:46:48 Namlings have such fragile jets they physically cannot bear the weight of disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:47:42 1 disconnector weighs 28 Ice trapdoors
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:48:23 Then again ice trapdoors and wooden trails are tied for the lightest blocks that still have weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:48:48 Cameras and texts do not weigh anything, though texts have mass while cameras do not
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:49:05 It actually has weight still, just upwards velocity is applied
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:49:50 It's a shitty caveman Chinese ripoff of a mew-gyro
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:50:02 Like
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:50:11 Actually primitive version of a mew-gyro
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:50:44 The issue is you have to make space for it too
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:50:51 And it can stick out like a sore thumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:51:20 If you're going to have thrust vectoring sticking outside your jet then use stuks design
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:51:48 His is like 1000x better anyway
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:52:03 It may not be a mew gyro but it's pretty good
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:52:18 You use a half piston to shrink size
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:52:22 It's a prismatic

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:55:43 Bang is so full of sugar and caffeine I don't even think Americans can survive it
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:57:17 Yeah 300mg of caffeine
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:57:25 Just checked
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:58:00 I chugged a can of it once and I was awake for the next week

creations-chat 2023-06-05 23:14:19 ^^^
And I don't even know you are, Im retired, and I don't give a wild fuck about your opinion.
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:13:46 Wsg y'all
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:13:53 Heard we have a dumbass in chat
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:14:29 No way bro ‚ò†Ô∏è
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:15:19 Void is completely different to core lmfao, it has to do with entities and anchors tricking the game into think your anchored (serverside)
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:15:24 Allows you to go invulnerable
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:15:28 And under the void
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:15:55 Message me if you want to understand how tech actually works
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:16:04 I'll be home in a few hours I'm at the airport
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:16:17 I work with toutou and develop Roblox shit lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:16:32 I know the code explanation behind core and void
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:16:55 Ye I do
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:17:23 Only if you don't leak shit lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:18:06 It does, demean is 2 parts
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:18:15 The motor 2 just allows it to clip through stuff
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:18:23 Allows for a blacklist type of cut
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:22:38 Cuz fak yuo!!!
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:23:05 That and I am desperately searching for ways to make void way more efficient
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:23:13 Recently integrative found a way
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:23:17 So we're looking into it
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:23:43 T, Z, 2, T
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:23:53 Haven't seen you in a while
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:24:06 Nah older one
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:24:38 Yeah that and there is security flaws with core
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:24:54 Hi queerleer
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:25:43 Btw r3xl there's new tech1!!1!11
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:25:54 Wake up babe new tech leak!!!
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:26:27 
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 21:26:31 EVEN MORE MODERN
