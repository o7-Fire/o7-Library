The Tale of maronku (1106804605347692644)
general 2023-06-21 23:30:59 nah bro mig-9 is ugly as
general 2023-06-21 23:31:06 mig-15 looks the best
general 2023-06-21 23:31:57 uh-huh
general 2023-06-21 23:32:10 nah it ends in mig-29
general 2023-06-21 23:32:16 by then the su 27 was just superior
general 2023-06-21 23:32:42 uh-huh
general 2023-06-21 23:32:49 yep sure
general 2023-06-21 23:33:35 the MiG-15 : also known as the plane that the US last faced in large numbers that was an actually competent opponent
general 2023-06-21 23:34:18 they were facing export models.... with downgraded electronics
general 2023-06-21 23:34:31 even worse was that they were 3rd gen fighting 4th gen
general 2023-06-21 23:34:38 so 3rd gen downgraded export models
general 2023-06-21 23:34:47 only the mig-25 was
general 2023-06-21 23:35:05 mig-23 was outdated and afaik there WERE someone mig-29s
general 2023-06-21 23:35:08 *some
general 2023-06-21 23:35:23 you mean F-94 right
general 2023-06-21 23:35:39 the po 2 killed an F-94 by making it stall
general 2023-06-21 23:36:02 huh?
general 2023-06-21 23:36:19 nah search it up
general 2023-06-21 23:37:23 nah
general 2023-06-21 23:37:30 0.2222 < 22
general 2023-06-21 23:37:48 a plane these days could easily carry that afaik
general 2023-06-21 23:37:57 and if so the B-52 would be like the best plane ever
general 2023-06-21 23:38:11 (applying logic to jokes)
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:11:37 until they turn on blacklist and then you accidently fly through them
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:30 "slow"
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:34 how "slow"?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:37 1000?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:45 thats pretty fast if you ask me
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:00 honestly i cant tell their speeds
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:13 they can decelerate quickly
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:19 they are
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:26 my max is 2500 so
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:53 im talking shredder balls here
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:08 the og shredder bugs and shredder swords are obsolete
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:24 really?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:33 sword shredders are very rare
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:39 i see shredder balls the most
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:44 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:47 the bugs
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:51 yeah some people have them
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:55 they're just a nuisance
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:03 because rockets dont track properly
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:10 but they're kinda easy to kill since shredder bugs go like
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:14 i swear they go like 150
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:17 they're that slow
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:52 shredder balls are essentially impossible to beat as a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:11 they go way too fast and if you score a hit it does nothing thanks to the rotating blades
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:19 what else are you meant to do?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:25 private server pvp?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:43 eh
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:49 why wouldn't you play pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:20:02 just use a plane man
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:20:10 not all servers have shredders either
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:20:20 unfortunate
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:20:32 you fall apart yeah ik
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:20:47 ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:21:05 pvp is more about practicality than looks
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:21:11 of course looks is still a factor
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:21:21 nobody likes generic 1x1 nam tuts
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:21:26 and certainly not shredders
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:05 they dont
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:10 it just expands out
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:16 and becomes a nuisance
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:40 i play pvp a lot
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:51 i got pretty good planes
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:25:02 ground vehicles are kinda worthless even tho i use them
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:27:52 namnam has a shit doctrine
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:28:01 "go slow and die" is his doctrine
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:28:24 planes are the omnipresent god builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:28:30 theres no nearly competition
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 13:12:52 the only things that are viable in pvp are conventional planes dude
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 13:12:59 vtol's gonna get you killed
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 13:13:24 you can't kill anything that flies fast (at least 500)
help 2023-07-07 13:05:17 answer : you don't.
help 2023-07-07 13:05:34 they got rid of the game's report system years and years ago
help 2023-07-07 13:06:01 ðŸ’€
help 2023-07-07 13:06:16 people can run around now with their funny carts as much as they want now
help 2023-07-07 13:06:26 you could do so too if you wanted to

general 2023-07-08 07:27:55 (birthday every 4 years)
general 2023-07-11 05:24:21 that's not an F-15
general 2023-07-11 05:24:27 that's some su-27 variant
general 2023-07-11 05:25:11 looks like a 35

general 2023-07-13 00:05:22 ive seen pretty dumb people on twitter with dumb takes
general 2023-07-13 00:05:31 yeah twitter is weird
general 2023-07-13 00:05:38 can agree with that
general 2023-07-13 00:05:59 wat
general 2023-07-13 00:06:10 that's valid
general 2023-07-13 00:06:20 anyone who consumes dihydrogen monoxide dies
general 2023-07-13 00:06:40 twitter is just trying to protect you from a dangerous substance
general 2023-07-13 00:07:32 BASED
general 2023-07-13 00:07:40 LET'S GO!
general 2023-07-13 00:08:02 its what people do with the platform not the platform owner's fault
general 2023-07-13 00:08:08 it is
general 2023-07-13 00:08:26 if tiktok was japanese everyone would be going like "OMG WHOLESOME ANIME UWU PLAYGOTM"
general 2023-07-13 00:09:03 china just has stricter regulations
general 2023-07-13 00:09:13 (keeping their younger generation sane)
general 2023-07-13 00:09:49 they're based off singapore arent they
general 2023-07-13 00:10:27 and uh
general 2023-07-13 00:11:01 bro you really think we can trust the ones who are trying to push a racist narrative?
general 2023-07-13 00:11:23 truth is the media doesn't like chinese people who don't take their side
general 2023-07-13 00:11:32 i don't watch either
general 2023-07-13 00:11:53 pretty much
general 2023-07-13 00:12:11 they all have the same takes when it comes to something china related
general 2023-07-13 00:12:20 its called the chinese version
general 2023-07-13 00:12:37 it's like the difference between genshin impact and yuanshen
general 2023-07-13 00:12:39 same thing
general 2023-07-13 00:12:41 same name
general 2023-07-13 00:12:43 same devs
general 2023-07-13 00:12:47 just a different rrgion
general 2023-07-13 00:12:57 in singapore....
general 2023-07-13 00:13:12 in china they follow chinese laws
general 2023-07-13 00:13:19 in the US they follow US laws
general 2023-07-13 00:13:30 if you wanna do business somewhere you better follow the laws
general 2023-07-13 00:13:43 tiktok is quite westernised
general 2023-07-13 00:14:36 exactly
general 2023-07-13 00:14:41 this man is speaking the truth
general 2023-07-13 00:15:41 a man is a male person
general 2023-07-13 00:15:46 a man is a raci-
general 2023-07-13 00:15:58 eh it worked
general 2023-07-13 00:16:11 i love racing
general 2023-07-13 00:16:25 a male is a person that identifies with the gender that has a kokomi
general 2023-07-13 00:16:29 a person is a being
general 2023-07-13 00:16:46 i have never had covid
general 2023-07-13 00:17:07 skeleton structure too
general 2023-07-13 00:17:29 they just make it less bad
general 2023-07-13 00:17:44 i just haven't got covid thanks to my health and avoiding skills
general 2023-07-13 00:18:03 hold on a second some people have XXY and shit
general 2023-07-13 00:18:12 as people think it is?
general 2023-07-13 00:18:20 except for astra-zeneca
general 2023-07-13 00:18:25 that thing can go in the bin
general 2023-07-13 00:18:34 pfizer gaming
general 2023-07-13 00:19:11 my science teacher was trying really hard to not offend lgbt peopke with chromosome shit
general 2023-07-13 00:20:33 bruh all i'll say is
general 2023-07-13 00:20:36 skeleton structure
general 2023-07-13 00:20:39 that's all
general 2023-07-13 00:21:20 unless someone breaks your pelvis
general 2023-07-13 00:21:23 and your shoulders
general 2023-07-13 00:21:31 people should be able to tell
general 2023-07-13 00:22:14 every analogy has its limitations
general 2023-07-13 00:22:34 ^
general 2023-07-13 00:22:58 they are BORN WITH IT
general 2023-07-13 00:23:13 if you lose it you still have your chromosomes and original skeleton structure
general 2023-07-13 00:23:49 klee gamign
general 2023-07-13 00:24:22 Watch your language.
general 2023-07-13 00:27:41 they are more intelligent than you tho
general 2023-07-13 00:27:49 and you're still a human
general 2023-07-13 00:28:07 because you are intelligent in comparison to other beings like pigs, dogs, etc.
general 2023-07-13 00:31:46 how big are they in comparison to other beings?
general 2023-07-13 00:32:01 how smart are they in comparison to other beings
general 2023-07-13 00:32:28 uh-huh but are they as intelligent
general 2023-07-13 00:32:47 are robots alive?
general 2023-07-13 00:32:56 science vs philosophy
general 2023-07-13 00:32:59 klee gamign
general 2023-07-13 00:33:17 are pig babies smarter?
general 2023-07-13 00:34:01 science is a big umbrella
general 2023-07-13 00:34:11 marxism is also a science
general 2023-07-13 00:35:00 uh
general 2023-07-13 00:35:06 people THEORISED the earth was flat
general 2023-07-13 00:35:32 people also THEORISED the earth was round
general 2023-07-13 00:35:49 bro you're a whitename
general 2023-07-13 00:39:53 explain why people still thought they'd fall off the face of the earth
general 2023-07-13 00:40:01 when sailing too far
general 2023-07-13 00:40:32 bro has a superiority complex
general 2023-07-13 00:40:44 you're a whitename too remember that
general 2023-07-13 00:42:40 roblox is based off an old and shitty engine
general 2023-07-13 00:42:47 doesn't even use 100% of your CPU
general 2023-07-13 00:42:51 only uses 50%
general 2023-07-13 00:43:18 heard roblox servers only had 3GB per server to work with
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:25:16 not really no
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:25:27 above a point any build becomes practically invincible
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:25:41 it's fun to get a supermaneuverable bomber and troll "op" planes, yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:25:45 but they just aren't fun
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:26:10 you can't use more primitive forms of tech like tanks because they have a 100% chance of winning against you while you have a 0% chance of winning against them
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:26:48 you try to fire at them? oops, your range isn't enough/rick hit detection doesn't work against anything faster than 1000
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:00 pvp servers are dominated by shitty spam cars and tutorials
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:12 when a good build does roll around
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:18 turns out
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:26 good builds can't fight good builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:39 good jets can't fight other good jets unless one of their pilots are a dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:40 of both
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:27:42 *or
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:28:30 im a pilot in pvp and my kdr is essentially *number*-0 because it is impossible to kill a good jet with a good pilot unless they're unaware
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:28:44 it's even worse with "op" builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:29:27 plane crazy pvp is just bad
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:29:35 there's a clear hierachy of power
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:29:41 in terms of creation types
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:29:54 naval builds are essentially worthless trash for my bomber to hit with cruise missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:07 ground builds are inferior to those in the air
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:08 etc
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:34 really?
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:46 nah rick hit detection
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:57 i usually slow down with my planes to match the enemy's speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:10 yeah your reaction speed has to be insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:17 speed is only acceptable up to a certain extent
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:30 that's because they're piloted by an idiot
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:37 who has the namnam mindset
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:57 "do fancy overcomplicated low speed maneuvers, be shot down by someone with common sense"
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:07 huh
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:19 eh
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:27 i use wasd + m2m as a hybrid
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:31 control type
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:59 i haven't lost a fight where i remained above 600 speed at all times
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:33:17 i have rudder and elevator for m2m and rudder, elevator and roll for wasd
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:33:30 it's just that the m2m versions are weaker than the wasd version of the same controls
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:33:55 it was made for me as a way to transition from wasd to m2m but i decided m2m is shit so
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:34:16 speed is essential in a fight
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:34:31 remain above 600 and all hits on you will be "sparks"
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:34:35 and do nothing to you
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:34:47 maneuverability means a lot too
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:34:58 but you could have a plane with amazing psms
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:35:06 and still lose to a plane with no psms at all
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:35:13 if you use the wrong tactics
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:35:21 because your enemy doesn't have to follow you into psms
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:35:33 they don't have to play the same rules as you
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:36:06 and honestly there's nothing a tank let alone ship can do against a well piloted plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:36:28 i gave up on my tanks back in 2021/2022
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:36:44 i still use them it's just that there isn't any making them better
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:37:01 i used the same plane from 2019/20 all the way to 22 before replacing it
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:13 nah what else are you meant to use
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:30 fireworks don't have enough range
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:34 guns don't doenough dama
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:35 ge
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:46 uh
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:55 yuuri gaming
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:39:59 i didn't read the manga tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:03 i know about the ending tho :/
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:11 guns don't do enough damage
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:15 i can easily stay out of range of fireworks
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:21 EVEN WORSE
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:25 guns could turn the enemy invis
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:31 and you'd basically lose at that point
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:40 planes might have poor aim at 1000 speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:50 but you have 0 chance against them
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:40:56 while they have a 1 in 100 chance of hitting you
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:41:12 and reaction against an enemy plane is everything when you're fighting planes in tanks
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:41:20 so put in a second plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:41:22 and you're done for
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:41:34 you have to keep track of two planes at once
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:43:21 that's the tank_1944 mindset
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:43:28 tanks are ground vehicles.
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:43:35 the moment you make a tank flyable it's a plane.
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:43:40 or an air vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:44:19 uh
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:44:21 most planes use rockets
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:44:30 the rockets would go STRAIGHT THROUGH the tnt
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:44:47 best thing you should do is add one of those HEAT cages
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:44:50 that the russians have on their tanks
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:45:32 not really
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:45:50 fighting for ground in tanks vs planes is like germany vs soviet union
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:45:59 it LOOKS like you could win
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:06 but turns out you'd lose really badly in the end
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:14 super low-end aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:15 like tut A-10s
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:20 with bad pilots
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:29 and sometimes high-end aircraft that pull too many psms
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:36 can be shot down.
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:40 and that makes you think tanks can win
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:46:48 but then you get hit with the reality of an actually good plane with a competent pilot.
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:28 nah you can
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:32 i do it regularly
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:39 you gotta get lucky too
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:45 nah a lower level plane user
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:48 often doesn't have the maneuverability
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:47:52 to react
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:02 when you use the 'bull vs red flag' strat
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:08 then they're not lower level
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:10 wait
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:13 are we talking about pilots
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:16 or planes
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:19 in terms of lower level
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:34 the 'bull' (plane) rushes at the tank (red flag)
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:47 but the tank returns fire at the last second and then moves out of the way of the 'bull'
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:52 it kinda does
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:48:54 but yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:49:26 the tut plane isn't even armed
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:49:42 what's its top speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:11 70?
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:13 you sure
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:18 not 700?
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:26 bro thats pathetic
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:29 i could shoot him down easily
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:34 i fight planes that go like 300
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:50:58 but yeah the majority of tanks suck
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:51:05 they often don't even have elevation
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:51:10 and have garbage mobility
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:51:16 armour doesn't matter for tanks
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:51:42 naval is even worse
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:51:53 i just slam cruise missiles into enemy ship's defences
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:04 most of the time i don't even have to use my main payload to force them to respawn
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:09 the cruise missiles taking out their defences is enough
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:19 only idiots would do naval
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:29 yeah my bomber isn't really the best
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:35 since i don't use real cluster bombs
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:45 i just have everything in a bomb bay
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:52:49 so i have to bomb at super low speeds
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:54:28 but yeah this is how dead pvp is
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:54:51 planes > everything
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:54:58 actually my tank has amphibious capabilities to some extent
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:55:08 and i just steamrolled a naval server with its main cannon
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:55:20 didn't even have to use my cruise missiles or scatter bombs
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 09:30:26 missiles never worked in the first place
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 09:30:43 your u-2 would have to be sitting still or basically hovering
help 2023-07-15 09:38:45 wing for it is acceptable but you gotta fix the tail
help 2023-07-15 09:39:51 and the elevator
help 2023-07-15 09:41:22 i have a pretty bad MiG-21 with garbage proportions
help 2023-07-15 09:41:24 but like
help 2023-07-15 09:41:27 position the uh
help 2023-07-15 09:41:32 it feels wrong tbh
help 2023-07-15 09:41:41 move it back one block
help 2023-07-15 09:41:46 elevator
help 2023-07-15 09:41:48 more backwards
help 2023-07-15 09:42:19 yes this is a post-bis variant
help 2023-07-15 09:42:24 yeah
help 2023-07-15 09:42:25 do that
help 2023-07-15 09:42:29 as you can see
help 2023-07-15 09:42:34 the rudder and the elevators
help 2023-07-15 09:42:41 "overhang" the uh
help 2023-07-15 09:42:49 exhaust
help 2023-07-15 09:42:58 that's the main issue of your plane
help 2023-07-15 09:43:05 the tail is positioned too far foward
help 2023-07-15 09:43:09 *forward
help 2023-07-15 10:18:19 thats better
help 2023-07-15 10:18:23 OMD
help 2023-07-15 10:18:26 THE TAIL IS EVEN WORSE
help 2023-07-15 10:18:31 MY EYES
help 2023-07-15 10:19:04 didn't you fix it
help 2023-07-15 10:19:09 the tail isnt like that irl
help 2023-07-15 10:23:00 yep
help 2023-07-15 10:23:24 wdym mean
help 2023-07-15 10:23:40 looks perfectly fine to me
help 2023-07-15 10:24:00 can't see anything
help 2023-07-15 10:24:03 all i can see is that it doesnt move
help 2023-07-15 10:24:19 which shouldn't be happening unless you accidently welded it somkewhere
help 2023-07-15 10:24:25 move it one more block back
help 2023-07-15 10:25:03 from where it currently is
help 2023-07-15 10:25:13 merges?
help 2023-07-15 10:25:14 wdym merges
help 2023-07-15 10:25:21 like do they overlap
help 2023-07-15 10:25:27 and the exhaust jams the mechanism to move the elevators?
help 2023-07-15 10:25:58 all i can say is
help 2023-07-15 10:26:06 move it backwards by one block
help 2023-07-15 10:26:16 and set it up like this again
help 2023-07-15 10:26:24 you redesigned the elevator slightly there
help 2023-07-15 10:26:40 try and keep the same shape
help 2023-07-15 10:26:45 rn we want it to be working
help 2023-07-15 10:27:47 it looks fine as it is rn
help 2023-07-15 10:27:53 the actual elevator
help 2023-07-15 10:27:56 but its placed wrong
help 2023-07-15 10:27:59 don't redesign the elevator for now
help 2023-07-15 10:28:06 place that same elevator design
help 2023-07-15 10:28:09 but like 3-4 blocks backwards
help 2023-07-15 10:28:22 this one here is a different design
help 2023-07-15 10:49:17 yep
help 2023-07-15 10:49:22 the tail is good now
help 2023-07-15 10:49:27 but now move the wings back a bit too
help 2023-07-15 10:49:58 mmm wait
help 2023-07-15 10:50:03 yeah move it back like 0.5 to 1 block
help 2023-07-15 10:50:11 it's looking good tho
help 2023-07-15 10:50:13 like the general profile
help 2023-07-15 10:54:07 yeah
help 2023-07-15 10:54:14 save the current version tho
help 2023-07-15 10:54:17 it looks pretty good but
help 2023-07-15 10:54:23 maybe let's see what happens if we move the wing back a bit
help 2023-07-15 11:43:49 um
help 2023-07-15 11:43:51 ok if you think its good
help 2023-07-15 11:43:53 then keep it as it is
help 2023-07-15 11:44:11 i heavily recommend multiple images and using aircraft blueprints in the future
help 2023-07-15 11:59:16 take photos of it then\
help 2023-07-15 15:21:37 irl it would probs have a green radome since well the red is just the intake cover
help 2023-07-16 00:34:08 well yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:32:27 ðŸ’€ pvp doesnt work anyway
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:32:47 the moment a plane goes above 1000 it becomes invincible
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:34:04 same point as before - even if you can keep up with them you won't be able to do anything to them
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:34:57 speeds above 2000 arent that useful except to run
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:35:12 the higher the speed the less reward you get
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:35:42 above 1750 the usefulness of speed just becomes a "running away" tool
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:36:32 namnam's whole doctrine is a disaster
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:36:54 i don't even need his fancy thrust vectoring because if he does just maneuvers on the same spot
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:36:59 i can hit him - he can't hit me
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:37:08 even if he does his rockets do absolutely nothing
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:37:24 i've actually killed nam before in public pvp without knowing it was him until someone pointed it out to me
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:41:53 that's because they on my go after what they think is easy
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:42:32 my tank has killed more nams than my fighters up until recently because nams let their guards down against "weaker builds"
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:42:49 as soon as you pull out an equal they hit full throttle and start running away like children
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:42:54 they just want kills
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:02 they will choose the easier target
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:06 over the harder one
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:17 their pilots are dumb
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:27 on a real hard target it will never end in a kill
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:34 it will end in a stalemate because rick physics
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:43:43 unless you catch them offguard or smth
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:44:24 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:44:48 its based off what tech you have up to a certain point
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:44:52 then its based off pilot error
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:45:09 sloped armour is less effecient imo
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:45:14 rockets are just mini bombs
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:45:26 you want to put HEAT cages everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:45:34 for maximum protection against rockets and fireworks
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:47:14 oh?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:47:19 they do?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:47:27 maybe my armour just isnt sloped enough
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:48:45 that's normal
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:48:54 the game isn't designed for anything above those speeds
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:49:11 notice how most super rocket planes cap out at like 700 or smth idk
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:49:35 to go faster you need other engines
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:05 just use hover engines only
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:10 no point using super rockets
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:23 wtf is torque
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:31 with hover you get insane acceleration
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:41 hm
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:50:56 hover gives good enough mer anyway
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:10 i generally go 600 with complex maneuvers
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:21 ie using my rudder and my elevators (wasd ones)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:31 altho all you really need is acceleration
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:43 because once you're above 750 you're out of the danger zone
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:51:47 you can't really be hit
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:52:24 i dont think it really matters when i turn above 600
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:53:27 while i do lose lots of speed in maneuvers i just compensate by controlling the throttle
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:57:38 i figured its probs because of the "speed cap" of super rockets
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:57:59 i have a full super rocket bomber that i do insane maneuvers with (nothing cna shoot it down probably)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 05:58:11 and it just maneuvers at like 600 and loses 0 speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:01:06 with rockets?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:01:15 and were you flying in a straight line
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:01:23 wtf
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:02:10 honestly i find that super hard to believe considering my past experience but ok
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:02:21 the fastest plane i've shot down was likely going 900
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:03:56 honestly i also figured
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:03:59 the lower your fps
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:04:05 the more cursed hit detection is
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:04:30 yeah you don't really need 165 fps
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:04:37 maybe that's why you're getting shot down more?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:05:05 i had an old plane where i could fly straight and take 0 damage
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:05:19 but now if i try the same thing with my upgraded PC i get shot down after like 4 hits
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:05:27 from rockets
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:05:30 (and even deflect them because yes)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:05:51 60fps isnt that bad tbh
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:06:29 altho even when i have had rockets hit me at a high speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:06:32 they either do 0 damage
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:06:39 or take off like a single block
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:06:53 i've had dogfights where i straight up flew through the rockets being fired at me
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:07:02 and took no damage
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:07:12 flew as in accelerated into
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:14:47 "thrust vectoring hover drive"
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:14:50 isnt that pretty easy?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:14:56 like doesnt nam have one
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:15:22 nam just has a bad fighting style
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:15:48 nam's fighting style prioritises low speed maneuvers
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:15:54 well extreme low speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:16:14 it's better to go high speed than it is to stay at low speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:16:45 interesting
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:17 i just put mine in my own aircraft for smoother mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:35 nah he said he aint gonna give it
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:37 might as well give up
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:11 (would get you killed in plane crazy)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:23 (overshoots don't do anything in this game if they just accelerate past you)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:33 strongest ship vs weakest plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:48 i find gjsolo's style more practical than nam's
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:06 nam's just looks cool and is better suited towards 90% planes in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:10 but towards a near peer adversary
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:14 it isnt that good
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:23 they look smoother in a way
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:35 and they can be used in some places
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:41 i still have no idea what nam's obsession with weight i
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:20:10 like weight doesnt even do that much in this game
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:20:52 they don't do much
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:21:02 my main fighter is a canard design
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:21:10 i just use the canard for m2m purposes :/
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:21:36 nam thrust vectoring is useful for improving low and high speed control
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:21:58 it doesn't allow many new maneuvers tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:22:34 ^
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:22:39 you can fly a plane with barely any wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:23:10 altho i just build canard-only fighters
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:23:14 like the J-10 and J-20
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:57 canards don't do that much if you mount it close the centre of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:25:39 you gotta mount your main control surfaces as close as possible to the rear or front of your plane for maximum maneuverability
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:26:16 couldn't you make a slightly unstable design tho?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:26:32 that you can use m2m control surfaces to balance out
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:26:42 as trim
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:03 shredder balls
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:13 shredder bugs are obsolete
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:54 shredders are just a nuisance to ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:56 they're nothing to planes
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:06 well if they fought
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:18 how about you try fighting at 60fps first
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:32 165fps may be making it easier for you to get hit
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:39 even at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:54 wat
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:01 ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:06 did you use 165fps in the past
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:08 when you got shot down
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:13 at 2k+
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:27 i havent been staying on top of fps unlocker stuff
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:36 oh
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:41 could've told me it was 165hz not 165fps
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:32:06 my monitor goes anywhere from 60Hz to 120Hz
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:32:11 well 50Hz to 120Hz
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:32:56 nam's fighting style is far more cinematic
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:33:09 i've shot down nam before but not gjsolo (never met him before ingame)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:33:28 i just pirate premiere pro
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:33:33 for everything i do
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:34:59 most planes can't even go that fast
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:35:03 and rockets just don't work at those speeds
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:35:24 mine max out at 2.5k
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:36:28 i just don't see the point of going that fast
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:36:55 you can't hit anything altho ntohing can hit you
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:37:45 most of my planes are pretty bad at low speed maneuverability anyway
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:37:57 you don't need lots of low speed maneuverability to win against nam tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:38:40 you just need nam to be distracted by smth else
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:38:42 hit smth critical
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:38:45 then finish him off
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:04 and while he's doing his fancy on-the-spot maneuvers
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:06 just kill him
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:16 aight bye
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:20 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:27 su 27s aren't the best builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:37 they don't exactly have a fuselage rear of the cockpit
