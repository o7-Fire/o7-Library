plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:25:33 feedback?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:27:15 never
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:27:18 :)))
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:36:26 where what?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:29:38 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:29:44 how fast should my F22 go?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:30:01 i can get mine up to 2k but then i can't control it
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:30:08 i can control it fine at 500
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:30:53 ew, use legionaire camo
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:30:57 much better
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:32:58 what gun is that?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:33:22 is it just multyple guns stacked?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:34:03 or just do no camo and save our eyes
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:34:06 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:20 no actually maus was never used in battle
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:25 same with E100
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:30 they are prototypes
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:36 so camo was useless anyway
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:50 its ugly camo
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:35:55 you can do better by imagination
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:37:04 whatever, have fun with an ugly tank then
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:37:45 no one cares xD
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:37:53 just make a camo urself that looks good
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:38:58 how can it look damaged if it was never seen anywhere else then where it was build?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:42:49 eh, doesn't make it damaged
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 14:45:46 no u
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:16:24 russian turrets are mostly round...
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:16:58 round
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:17:21 is this flat or round?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:17:30 smh
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:17:59 this is flat
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:18:34 i just said that was flat...
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:50:40 what should i change?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:08 bad pun
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:26 costum landing gear?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:38 k
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:39 i can try
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:45 i don't have a whole lot of space left inside tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:51:57 i'll look for reconfiguring the engine layout
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:52:01 inside
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:52:20 rn its pretty crappy you see
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:54:42 how can i add more engines but don't have them make me pitch down?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:55:46 problem is that
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:55:52 when the engines are off
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:18 the nose just about doesn't go up from itself
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:23 but when i turn on the engines at max thrust
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:26 i pitch down
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:34 unless i stay below 500
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:40 but 500 is a bit meh for an F22
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:52 : /
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:56:55 same
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 15:57:42 and how to not make it go crazy when static?
general 2022-01-27 21:53:22 is it allowed to post a creation twice in <#384025409945337856> ?
general 2022-01-27 21:53:30 if you have modified it
general 2022-01-27 21:54:12 eh i suppose so
general 2022-01-27 21:54:14 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-01-27 21:58:22 eh
general 2022-01-27 21:58:30 its my best build so far
general 2022-01-27 21:58:46 smh
general 2022-01-27 21:58:48 its good
general 2022-01-27 21:58:54 explain
general 2022-01-27 21:59:26 bruh are you blind
general 2022-01-27 21:59:42 the intakes are right there...
general 2022-01-27 21:59:58 next to the cockpit
general 2022-01-27 22:00:09 kinda hard to do
general 2022-01-27 22:00:18 bc its connected to the botom
general 2022-01-27 22:00:27 so if i colour the inside black
general 2022-01-27 22:00:32 it automatically does the botom
general 2022-01-27 22:01:45 <#384021699466756107>
general 2022-01-27 22:01:48 let me show you
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:02:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:02:11 i just told you, i can't
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:02:18 no dumbass
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:02:33 not without the botom of the plane being black
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:02:52 this
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:04:53 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:05:17 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:05:25 sourse of model https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/f75002d948969d0be9e129730123c4ce/F-22-raptor?hl=fr
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:06:12 general shape is good, the nose is weird, yes but its the closest i could get it but else the shape is very close to what it should be
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:06:39 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:07:20 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:07:25 i didn't do any motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:07:34 im not comfortable with that right now
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:07:47 so thats why there are some holes n such for motors for wings n such
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:08:16 the back is very close to what it should be tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:10:00 oh yea btw anyone got some ideas about making the wedges look more like control panels?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:10:20 they don't work on wedges
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:10:52 i had to work with limited space, they are still fine for what they are... a bit squiched
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:11:04 and how to do that?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:11:09 also emojis don't work for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:11:18 can't get em on the sign
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:13:29 wdym angle wrong
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:13:59 they are angled
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:15:41 look, without spending 3 months motor locking everything this is a good build, you cannot always make everything perfect in a game with wedges and blocks, you cannot always get the dimensions exactly right when building something for the first time
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:15:48 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:15:53 how many degs should it be
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:16:29 smh
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:16 too litle or too much?
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:30 tell me
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:37 tell me
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:41 if you are kiddo smartass
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:43 you can see
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:47 are they angled too much
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:50 or too litle
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:52 tell me
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:17:53 i know it
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:18:20 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:19:56 nope
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:19:58 its too much
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:20:02 they are angled at 25 degs
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:20:06 whilst according google
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:20:09 they should be 15
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:21:55 hey, im not lying
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:22:09 the numbers aren't lying
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:28:13 and then that gets 80 upvotes whilst it doesn't look anything like an f22
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:28:16 jeez this server is rigged
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:37:41 bro go complain at google xD
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:38:21 its another jet...
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 07:40:27 listen up, even that jet isn't perfect, if i go complain like alxti96 i could make a full list of it.
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:35:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:35:20 huge bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:35:32 a 5 by2 engine just got my f22 up to 5k (in0.01 sec or so)
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:35:41 broken xD
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:39:05 hm
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:39:07 2and
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:39:10 looks more realistic
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:41:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:41:20 is this a joke?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:41:49 these wing panels, for going up and down are at 5 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:41:50 and still
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:41:54 they give too much force
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:43:26 guys this litle thing can get my 500+ block F22 to 1.5k in less then a second
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:43:29 isn't that a bit broken
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:44:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:44:14 but the conveyor is at 10%
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:44:24 at 30 it went to  5k for me
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:44:40 ah
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:45:28 can you see how mumch the main wing flaps move up?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:45:40 if i do more then just tap em i start to spin like crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:45:59 ||it's  5degs||
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 08:47:08 yeah well its op
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:19:38 can you add signs on top of wedges?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:19:48 like that they are on the wedge and not floating above it
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:42:56 anyone know how to put signs on wedges?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:44:34 conveyor = solution to interstellar travel
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:46:28 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:50:54 i have made an drift ufo
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:50:57 its weird
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 10:51:10 bc it can't fly at all but drife like the best drift cars xD
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:33:39 eh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:33:42 if you say its a jet
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:33:43 then yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:33:47 if u say its an F22
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:33:51 then hell no xD
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:38:30 duh everything is far from perfect
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:38:47 kgrt
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:38:52 stop the kidding lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:40:14 hm?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:40:50 the shape? xD only one vertical stabelizer
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:40:53 its like you make a plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:41:00 and forget to add engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:41:04 not angled
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:41:09 or far away enough from eachother
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 13:41:38 im not talking about that plane dumbass
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:21:44 haha im gonna build dora
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:22:03 
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:49:36 and what is that supposed to be then?
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:50:08 its called dora yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 11:51:41 yes, the whole thing is called the dora
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 11:53:13 bad blueprint
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 15:59:23 
creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:16:34 added some trails
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:27:49 what detail can i add or what should i change to make it more realistic?
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:28:49 huh
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:29:00 can you make a drawing of it or so, i don't rly understand
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:30:02 ?
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:50:29 A f22 doesn't even have rounded wings
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 18:47:49 ah, idk if i can put that on there
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 18:47:57 without reworking the whole wings that is
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 18:48:19 i mean i can without reworking but then it won't be rounded
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 19:08:50 Why is this server so toxic?? If u want real feedback just ask in-game
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 19:12:00 Ah, seems like you wanted to be a perfect example of what i just said :D
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:34:44 they are the same i think
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:35:05 hm
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:35:09 didn't know
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:35:20 test it out lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:35:46 horn
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:36:27 the horns are gone
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:37:22 best block in the game? ||i say helium||
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:38:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:38:03 true
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:38:11 tho helium can make a shit creation fly
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:38:21 without making it looking much worse
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:00 i use it when i figure out i don't have enough thrust to pull my aircraft off the ground
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:13 F15 balloon go brr
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:30 yea but sometimes nose is too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:31 so
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:37 i just add helium to the nose
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:39:54 thats true tho lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:40:03 but it ain't as bad as putting a thruster up into ur airplane's nose
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:40:22 eh sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:40:46 yes, rule number 1, don't ask what the rules are
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:41:09 don't build nsfw stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:41:12 or lagg machines
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:41:52 yes,  isn't that what this server is all about?
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 15:43:07 don't do that then xD if u want feedback that doesn't include  90% downvote go ask ingame
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:10:21 why is this not working?
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:10:43 reverse propellors
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:10:48 it worked last week
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:11:00 smh explain
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:11:27 no, i want that, a few days ago it worked but it doesn't anymore
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:11:38 its basically same setup like last time just bigger
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:12:32 no prob, i'll try some things and maybe i can figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:12:59 hey, mister omega skill, do you actually know what is going on?
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:23:07 wtf is going on??? this is the exact save i had last week and it doesn't work anymore now
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:25:32 H.E.L.P
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:11 its a propellor engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:16 reversed one
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:26 i used that exacte build
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:30 this weekend
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:39 it made me go 100
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:48 now it doesn't even move a bit
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:26:58 i haven't changed any controls or so
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:54:39 bruv it somehow works again now
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 17:59:33 jeez this is powerfull
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 18:02:48 2 motors
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 18:28:36 pirate speedboat xD
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 11:11:40 140 upvotes xD
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 06:39:32 Looks nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 06:39:50 The back seems to just be sliced off and put a propellor on
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 06:40:26 Duh, yes that's what I'm saying
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 14:52:25 idk
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:56:34 eh random thing i just made
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:57:23 what yall think about it?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:58:04 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:58:20 do you have any better feedback
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:58:35 that isn't something that a *cough* 5 year old would say?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:58:51 eh
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:58:55 why should i xD
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:59:09 in what way?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:59:13 its not a recreation of anything
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:59:25 its just a thicc plane/rocket
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:00:01 eh
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:00:16 so what
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:00:30 im not allowed to make something that looks like a decapitated egg rocket with wings
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:03:37 nah, my build is gud
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:06:57 no, yall having to open up ur minds xD
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:07:12 not everything can be a  20 hour exacte recreation
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:07:17 fun fast build things
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:07:20 can be good
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:08:47 I just don't give a fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:08:54 Let me build my shit
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:11:00 It's imaginary spaceship, no military aircraft, I'm not interested in making it detailed or something that would exist in real world
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 20:56:41 **pink**
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:33:13 vtol kind of sub, what yall think of it ||i spent a lot of time on making this work, so i won't change it rn||
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:36:28 
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:36:31 what yall think of it, tell me
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:36:41 ik its horrific scrn shot quality
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:47:13 It's inspired by something that looks very bright red
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:47:35 Maybe the red can be a but less bright tone
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 13:11:46 does water actually give more friction to like a rudder then it doesn out of the water
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 13:11:49 or is it just the same?
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 13:12:02 (wondering if you could make a paddle boat)
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 14:51:00 yeah, i don' thave those, do you know how to get rid of the torque tho?
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:51:04 can someone explain to me how to make those things that are bigger then the build area
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:51:29 yeah well how to do folds?
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:51:40 eh i'll search on yt
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:51:42 yea
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:59:23 k lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:59:34 is camera better then the sign thingy
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 15:59:43 idk what i should chose
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 16:28:54 fixed the air intake vents with paint blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 18:11:28 is shortage of blocks something you need to take into consideration when building a big build?
general 2022-02-07 18:13:38 <#384021699466756107>  can someone answer me?

plane-crazy 2022-02-07 21:15:38 anyone experienced in big builds here?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 06:53:16 is shortage of blocks something i have to take into consideration (by using 7 long blocks instead of just normal blocks)
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 06:53:43 or will i be fine without
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 19:51:17 eh, the triangle shape and the angled vertical wings are what make it most stealthy
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 19:51:27 paint doesn't rly do much
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 19:51:48 it's more about the radar absorbing materials used

creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:21:52 <@!695983848575598664> about ur tank, maybe add a little machinegun on top of the main turret
creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:24:57 no you get downvotes because the bar is too high in this server, everyone just thinks that someone can spend 5 hours long working on a thing when they just learned tho how to build a plane
