help 2020-02-06 17:20:37 I don't want to use rockets.
help 2020-02-06 17:22:06 Alright.
help 2020-02-06 17:26:05 I'll probably just search a conveyor driver.
help 2020-02-06 17:26:08 drive*
help 2020-02-06 17:27:52 I really haven't built anything advanced, but what's your progress so far?
help 2020-02-06 17:28:23 The AT-ST
help 2020-02-06 17:28:59 Hm.
help 2020-02-06 17:29:24 I would mainly start with the "skeleton" of the building, so like the "bones" of the legs, etc.
help 2020-02-06 18:02:27 I think I made the conveyor drive wrong.
help 2020-02-06 18:02:30 It's not working.
help 2020-02-06 18:06:31 Oop.
help 2020-02-06 18:06:34 It worked.
help 2020-02-06 18:09:46 Though, it doesn't spin.
help 2020-02-06 18:30:57 Hm.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:02:28 How would I make something spin with conveyor drives or maybe magnet drives?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:02:49 I used 2 conveyor drives going opposite directions on 2 different sides but it didn't spin my build.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:03:36 I don
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:03:42 I don't really want to use rockets.*
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:04:16 I tried but it wasn't powerful enough.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:05:05 Like, I made 2 1x3 magnet drives on opposite sides, but it wasn't powerful enough.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:05:08 It barely spun.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:06:47 Here, I'll make it again and take a pic.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:06:58 Just incase I did do something wrong.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:07:31 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:07:35 Imagine that on the other side too.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:07:50 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:08:09 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:08:18 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:08:37 Like the whole side?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:08:54 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:09:46 It's still slow.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:06 https://gyazo.com/55efaa0d0802ff36d2f56e59099e3db2
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:16 Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:36 I have one on the other side too.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:41 Wait.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:46 I need the bigger range.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:10:47 I forgot.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:11:28 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:11:31 It's still slow.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:11:38 Where would I place the other mag drives?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:11:58 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:12:03 Use suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:12:17 wwww
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:16:58 Trying the suspension thing.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:17:07 It's about the same.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:18:57 How should I make it spin?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:00 I don't like using rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:07 And the way you told me didn't work.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:16 Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:33 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:38 oh
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:40 i think
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:42 i see the problem
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:19:55 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:22:40 Wait.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:23:20 What if I attached a motor to a conveyor drive...
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:30:05 It failed.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:39:17 Is there a way to make something spin?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:39:27 With magnet/conveyor drives.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:39:53 Like, a build.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:39:55 I made a beyblade.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:40:23 Is this with conveyor drives?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:40:53 Like this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:42:19 Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:42:23 Pistons on the side of it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:42:44 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:42:46 Like that?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:44:17 
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:44:26 Is that what you're talking about?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:44:42 Sorry if I'm annoying.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 19:45:41 Ohh.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 20:09:07 Do I make that in like the middle?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 21:10:52 Backup, do I have to make 2 of the conveyor drives?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 21:10:57 Or do I only have 1?
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 21:29:34 It didn't work.
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 21:29:38 I have 2 right now.

plane-crazy 2020-02-07 00:52:37 How would I make a beyblade move?
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 00:53:49 Not like spin, but move in a direction.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:17 My friend is making a build and sometimes his pistons won't work.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:25 Help is appreciated.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:46 I think a video might help.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:17 I'll try explaining actually.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:38 So, he uses the button to activate the pistons to rise the height, but they're not working.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:55 At first it works, but then later it doesn't.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:38:04 *He's making a beyblade, by the way.*
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:39:55 Do you need a video?
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:41:11 His other builds are good, but this one's pistons doesn't work.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 01:14:06 My friend fixed it.
help 2020-03-03 00:42:32 How do I make a motor make something spin?
help 2020-03-03 00:42:37 I phrased that
help 2020-03-03 00:42:39 baddly
help 2020-03-03 00:42:41 badly*
help 2020-03-03 00:42:59 Alright
help 2020-03-03 00:42:59 
help 2020-03-03 00:43:14 So, the red part moves which I don't want it to when I use that motor that's circled in blue
help 2020-03-03 00:43:17 it's a wheel
help 2020-03-03 00:43:27 Do I need to add more weight to the red part?
help 2020-03-03 00:43:53 Make the wheel move
help 2020-03-03 00:44:08 
help 2020-03-03 00:44:09 Front side
help 2020-03-03 00:46:00 Well
help 2020-03-03 00:46:03 Not spin
help 2020-03-03 00:46:21 But make the wheel turn to where the "rims" are on the ground
help 2020-03-03 00:46:57 Like a BTF Delorean
help 2020-03-03 00:54:14 Do I need to give a better example?
help 2020-03-03 00:54:49 
help 2020-03-03 00:54:53 I want the wheel to face down like that
help 2020-03-03 00:54:58 How would I do that?
help 2020-03-03 00:55:08 I've done it before but I can't seem to find out how I did it.
help 2020-03-03 00:56:30 I know
help 2020-03-03 00:56:34 I am using a motor
help 2020-03-03 00:56:55 
help 2020-03-03 00:57:00 I think it's that red motor
help 2020-03-03 00:57:23 The red motor is for steering, the blue for the throttle, and the black for the wheel moving
help 2020-03-03 00:57:57 I think I found a solution
help 2020-03-03 00:58:04 Or I'm just making it worse
help 2020-03-03 00:58:44 Would I put it above the suspension?
help 2020-03-03 01:00:38 K
help 2020-03-03 01:07:55 Thank you for the help
help 2020-03-03 01:34:43 ooo

help 2020-03-03 01:40:12 I think so.
help 2020-03-03 01:40:17 I'm gonna try it.
help 2020-03-03 01:40:43 I think I did it wrong.
help 2020-03-03 01:40:58 Where would I connect the red circled motor too?
help 2020-03-03 01:41:00 to*
help 2020-03-03 01:44:32 
help 2020-03-03 01:44:38 Would I put the motor on the other side?
help 2020-03-03 01:45:16 I wouldn't.
help 2020-03-03 01:47:33 Uhh.
help 2020-03-03 01:56:04 ohh
