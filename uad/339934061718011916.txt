The Tale of arkenmot (339934061718011916)
general 2021-08-20 20:07:57 when it says in the aeronautical engineer rank that it has to be able to roll, does that mean completely roll of just roll enough to be able to turn?
general 2021-08-20 20:09:15 well, it says "Plane must be capable of yaw, pitch and roll."
help 2021-08-20 20:18:12 I'm not too sure on how to help you with that, but my best guess would be the config used on the motors
help 2021-08-20 20:27:23 now I have no idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 20:37:11 when it says "Plane must be capable of yaw, pitch and roll" in the aeronautical engineer rank , does that mean completely roll or just roll enough to be able to turn?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 20:38:12 basic maneuverability I guess?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 20:40:15 oh, that makes sense. so I just need it to be able to roll and not completely roll, like barrel roll
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 21:35:14 ok

creations-chat 2021-08-21 02:55:58 I'm still wondering how he managed to do that
the-dump 2021-08-21 02:59:36 I have no clue of what is happening in this chat rn
the-dump 2021-08-21 03:00:47 that makes sense

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:15:04 I'm still trying to understand what happened there
general 2021-08-21 03:16:53 I would say neither, just watch him
general 2021-08-21 03:17:36 rip
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:23:19 you need to reach level 3 to get pic perms
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:25:51 you just need to talk in the server to level up
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:25:58 then you can get pic perms at level 3
bot-central 2021-08-21 03:26:18 !rank
bot-central 2021-08-21 03:26:25 so close
bot-central 2021-08-21 03:51:05 Just to inform you why the !servers didn't work for you (got this from <#735554521992003584>):
Q: Why does the !servers command not work for me?
A: You first need to be ranked in order to access the !servers command. Ranks are listed in the <#609442446249820211> channel.

creations-chat 2021-08-21 03:56:41 image quality probably, since those breaks can be seen on the plot border as well
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:24:47 <@!737490829693681714> just type some messages to level up to send images, its easier than sending a link
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:29:16 I just build it and see if it flies
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:29:37 If it doesn't I just change things around until it does
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:17:31 to make a submarine fly, I would recommend just adding rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:17:36 a ton of them
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:17:40 that should work
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 01:18:22 yeah, that also works, but if the person only wants to fly for a moment, rockets would work too
general 2021-08-22 01:24:36 i see
bot-central 2021-08-22 02:09:57 what are you trying to do?
help 2021-08-22 02:21:47 it needs vertical wing panels to stop it from drifting sideways
help 2021-08-22 02:25:23 without vertical wing panels, there is nothing that is controlling your yaw movement
help 2021-08-22 02:25:57 
help 2021-08-22 02:26:44 so it is doing an involuntary yaw movement, since it has no vertical wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 02:31:57 to post in creations, you must first get image perms
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 02:32:13 so just keep chatting until you reach level 3
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 02:32:32 and to check you level, just go to <#384027830192832513> and do !rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 02:32:43 np
help 2021-08-22 02:40:37 anyone knows of any emoji that I could use to have something similar to what is shown in the image?
general 2021-08-22 02:59:23 anyone knows why lbs becomes tags when i try to type them in a sign?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 03:08:12 from my experience in build planes that sometimes also steer to the left or right, i would guess that it is your tail gun, since in the video, it is glitched inside your plane i think, if it is just the design, then idk
bot-central 2021-08-22 19:49:25 someone who was rank 68 previously
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:57 check <#705941616199991307>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:02:58 no clue
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:57 what do you mean by that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:33 oh, yeah that would be something nice to have
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:05:12 someday between this year and who knows when
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:06:37 in <#490306593242611742> , it is said "Data will not be lost, it will be easily transferred over to PC2, you will not lose anything or any settings.
I will make sure there will be backwards compatibility."
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:10:27 i think it would work better if it only had one or two of those, not the three of them
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:11:09 gbye
help 2021-08-22 21:57:55 is there any way to have letters on texts that are larger than 100?

help 2021-08-22 22:04:51 did you use cameras to connect things that are connected to the motor lock?
help 2021-08-22 22:05:24 because if you did, sometimes cameras may do that type of stuff
help 2021-08-22 22:05:35 but if you didn't use cameras, I have no idea
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:09:14 I think you could just build something similar using motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-08-23 23:22:35 <@!676970337770012683> when you posted your saturn V on creations and asked for rocket scientist V, you should first wait it to get the total score of 20 and then do a rank-request ticket as shown in <#705941616199991307>.
Requirements for rocket scientist V: Build a rocket of 2000+ blocks and get a total score of at least 20 (The total of upvotes is upvotes - downvotes. Your own vote and the vote given by the bot will not be counted towards the total.)

creations-chat 2021-08-24 21:50:03 I would like to try and do that, but it may be a little bit difficult, considering the way I built them
help 2021-08-24 21:53:22 can someone "teach" me the basics of how to make thicker wings?
creations-chat 2021-08-24 22:11:23 I upvoted it just now. One more upvote and it will have a score of 100
creations-chat 2021-08-24 22:13:54 he already can get designer V, it requires a score of 90
creations-chat 2021-08-24 22:16:19 from what I can see in <#609442446249820211>, there is no designer X
help 2021-08-24 22:19:51 ok, I will try doing that
