The Tale of supernt (615360707608838165)
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:33:45 I have made a plane that is kinda useless
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:34:08 It cannot change direction mid-air (unless using flip)
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:34:37 bruh I hate my username
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:34:45 why can‚Äôt I change it üò¶
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:38:01 I already changed my display name that sounds normal
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:38:24 But the bot doesn‚Äôt care
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:39:30 so uhh I‚Äôm wondering
how do I get image perms
cuz I want to send pic of my plane that has 18 buttons
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:39:55 oh ok
general 2021-06-28 01:45:14 i have a suggestion but I can‚Äôt post
Add computers which can automatically control engines based on outside signals with an if-clause, for example:
If: Plane is tilted front by 30 degrees
Then: Activate a propeller (which the propeller should be at the front of the plane so it can turn the plane back)
The computer must be next to the engine it is controlling so it can‚Äôt be too op
general 2021-06-28 01:49:30 Yes ik, im just seeing if someone that has the ability to post agrees with my idea and can post it in <#507673335816126509>
general 2021-06-28 01:49:54 Ok
general 2021-06-28 01:50:02 Oh
Well I‚Äôm new, thank you for telling me

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:56:19 So I‚Äôm wondering, how hard is it to get Aeronautical Engineer?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:56:43 It seems like you can get it by just building a normal plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:57:18 I have a plane that does not fit the requirements of any category in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:58:27 I built a plane that has the top speed of **exactly** 666
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:58:52 i don‚Äôt use tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:59:33 also in my opinion, using a tutorial kinda removes the point of playing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:30:02 I got the amount of buttons by 3rd plane has down to 16 buttons
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:30:57 Which 8 buttons are needed to control it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:32:20 fly
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:32:37 I am not going to answer
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:34:16 The first thing I noticed, there are pontoons and skis in the test server which do not exist in the actual game
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:37:12 They don‚Äôt.
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:38:13 By destroy shredder you guys mean the shredder on the sky island?
general 2021-06-28 02:39:07 I had 3 hours of Minecraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:39:51 built a huge plane that tank the shredder‚Äôs shots
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:40:28 make it so big that even if you destroy it, there are still working parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:40:51 *cries in not having pic perms*
bot-central 2021-06-28 02:41:02 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:41:34 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:41:57 I think u mean level 3
I‚Äôm already level 2
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:42:10 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:43:11 imagine if Rick changes the boat mechanics so it actually requires designing to make the boat float
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:43:20 (cuz rn everything can float)
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:44:37 yep
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:47:13 Nice lobby
bot-central 2021-06-28 02:47:37 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:48:20 Imagine if I submit my 16-button plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:48:50 With no control panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:49:08 Every plane I make is abnormal other than my first one
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:01:52 Why is the water wheel so slow
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:02:07 Do I put the Water Wheel at the side of the boat or at the front/ back?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:03:05 i have something that is basically the opposite
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:03:57 I have a plane named PowerBoard and it‚Äôs super big and has a lot of weapons/ missiles but hard to control
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 10:24:48 I reached 2837 speed using a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:34:09 *cries*
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:34:30 Oh
I have received image perms by crying about not having image perms
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:35:07 Thomas shall burn in hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:35:20 well it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:35:41 this thing with 16 buttons
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:36:30 2837 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:37:00 I jumped off a rocket that climbs only vertically
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:37:22 The rocket has no controls and the sole purpose is to ascend vertically
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:38:09 This is the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 12:38:59 does anyone not use infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:58:09 ah yes rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:58:27 it‚Äôs only 19 blocks
creations-chat 2021-08-09 05:03:37 <@!783822669182795806> My opinion on your cargo ship: Make it into Evergreen
Change the red hull into dark blue and add ‚ÄòEVERGREEN‚Äô in white
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:09:05 
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:09:05 Does this plane qualify for the rank Aeronautical Engineer II?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:09:56 then how
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:10:17 doesn‚Äôt it just need to be working and be 400+ blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:11:50 ok
creations-chat 2021-08-09 05:13:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:20:40 So I checked the requirements again and it does say it needs to be high effort
creations-chat 2021-08-09 09:55:06 I have a ship that I consider it ‚Äòfunctionally finished‚Äô, idk how to decorate it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:56:25 How much time do you spend on making & finishing one vehicle?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:56:50 wow
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:57:29 u play on pc?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:00:42 wedges are kinda frustrating for me to use
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:01:01 tho I think a plane must use wedges to be considered ‚Äòhigh effort‚Äô, which I use none
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:02:34 hard for me to find the correct wedge, or probably because im bad at the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:03:36 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:09:24 for me, sometimes the render distance drops when it lags
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:12:13 Put the landing gear of Plane Crazy, then put 1 block high at the side. The landing gear should be open to simulate the one in the picture
(I think I explained very badly)
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:13:16 im new to the plane crazy community, what‚Äôs ‚Äòcheesegrater‚Äô?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:13:39 and what‚Äôs a motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:15:55 I killed myself when I launched missiles while in max speed on this
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:16:36 the design of the boat is unfinished, the functionality is finished
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:17:52 What speed for boats is considered fast?
