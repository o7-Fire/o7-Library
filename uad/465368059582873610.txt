general 2021-02-15 17:43:13 Do I need a certain rank to post images?
general 2021-02-15 17:43:28 mmmmmmm alright
help 2021-02-15 17:45:04 Hey there! So I've been playing for 4 years now and I specialize in Star Wars builds. I have built a working scale model of Slave 1 with a full interior that flies in gravity with no shenainigans, BUT this small project is putting me through the ringer. This little drop ship I am building turns the wrong way. It uses standard control surfaces and it flies, rolls the right way, but turns the opposite direction. If my mouse goes right, it will roll right and turn left. The wing panels and control surfaces sit above the fuselage. I can't post images sadly. I joined the server for this issue specifically since my builds don't usually fall into what is considered worth while around here as far as I've heard. Does anyone have any idea why this thing turns the wrong way? Much obliged!
help 2021-02-15 17:46:28 Yeah for sure, but custom one's really aren't going to work on this
help 2021-02-15 17:46:34 yes I do lol
help 2021-02-15 17:47:04 the vertical stabilizer?
help 2021-02-15 17:47:23 ok thanks I'll try that and report back
help 2021-02-15 19:20:07 Power went out. Texas power grid is rolling power in and out because of weather. Getting back on to enlarge the vertical stabilizers now
help 2021-02-15 19:34:31 Oh maybe it's just central Texas where they're doing it
help 2021-02-15 19:34:53 aight well <@!719168864705052802> <@!705533053740777584> it works now! Thanks so much for the help!
help 2021-02-16 13:26:51 It’s the help channel and nobody knows me. So yeah I’m going to thoroughly explain. If you don’t have time to read a paragraph or two then don’t lmfao
help 2021-02-16 21:10:46 Not for what I do. Our server is way more active and fun than Star Crazy was. Don't get your knickers in a twist lol. I got the ship working I just needed a larger vertical stabilizer.
help 2021-02-16 22:31:01 It's not my business
help 2021-02-16 22:31:09 thanks for the heads up

help 2021-02-17 23:39:01 Hey so how does the ranking work? Like how do we prove that we've met requirements? Do we go into a server and demonstrate or...
help 2021-02-17 23:40:32 ok thanks
general 2021-02-22 20:58:10 So is it not possible to make a copilot seat in Plane Crazy or do they just not want to do it?

general 2021-05-16 04:32:51 Just finished my scale build of the Ebon Hawk
general 2021-05-16 04:33:06 probably my 2nd best ship besides my Slave 1 build
general 2021-05-16 04:42:01 life is so very special
general 2021-05-16 04:42:28 have you ever looked around and thought of the infinite consciousness that binds us all? and that we shall return to in death?
general 2021-05-16 04:43:08 it is so amazing to me that in all of that vast infinitely expanding matter and space, that I have to turn around and look at you, and see them nasty ass nose hairs
general 2021-05-16 04:45:13 remember when the ultimate driving games had actual car brands? I wonder if they got a cease and desist
general 2021-05-16 04:46:19 who wins? Thanos? Shreck? Shaggy? Or Chungus?
general 2021-05-16 04:51:05 I am going to a wedding
general 2021-05-16 04:51:13 in Mississippi
general 2021-05-16 04:51:26 and I'm in west Texas >_<
general 2021-05-16 04:51:43 when she's going down the aisle I should blast the Soviet anthem

creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:34:57 Lmao confederate flag 😂
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:37:39 Not even proper flag code on that tail (and again CSA, not offended just funny)
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:40:50 <@!299698224980164608> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/843558279300644864 looks great man! I would make the color lighter and  add the gold, as well as just put some different greys on there. Try to smooth out the top as well, and if you’re going for scale I think that’s a bit too big speaking from my own Razorcrest build. Keep up the good work!
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:42:58 Yeah, if he wants to keep it at that expanded size for detail, I would probably use motors to shape that but with wing panels. On mine I just did triangle wedges and wedge blocks since the scale size makes it too cramped for motor shaping.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:50:38 Then put wing panels on a motor and move to a flush angle
creations-chat 2021-05-17 23:03:35 Amogus that’s why
general 2021-05-18 14:06:45 Next time I’ll remember to submit my build at the very last second so I’m not waaay in the backlogs for voting
general 2021-05-18 14:07:07 Ugly
general 2021-05-18 14:08:54 I just generally hate cars build after 1990, the rounded off bubble shapes are just ugh
general 2021-05-18 14:09:45 Yeah, and that’s after 1990
general 2021-05-18 14:09:53 ^^
general 2021-05-18 14:11:39 Now THAT is some hot shit
general 2021-05-18 14:11:48 Box over formless bubble any day
general 2021-05-18 14:12:02 Much better, not amazing, but better IMO
general 2021-05-18 14:12:13 True
general 2021-05-18 14:12:44 I would like to see a cyber truck muscle car. It would probably just be a delorean 😂
general 2021-05-18 14:13:19 Well I didn’t say it would have the delorean engine my guy
general 2021-05-18 14:13:46 Plus I rly don’t care about performance that much. I would drive something that is 3 tons on a 4 cylinder if I thought it was pretty
general 2021-05-18 14:14:29 I’m jealous. I was at paintball the other day and they had and old celica as cover and it broke my heart
general 2021-05-18 14:14:39 Im sure it was beyond repair when they bought it but uuuggghhh
general 2021-05-18 14:16:54 Damn, I would go pick one up now if they were that cheap.
general 2021-05-18 14:17:40 Down where? Australia still?
general 2021-05-18 14:17:55 Gotcha
general 2021-05-18 14:18:28 Man it’s so weird whenever I talk to people in the Southern Hemisphere. Texans are only used to talking about anything further south than us when we’re talking to our Mexican friends 😂
general 2021-05-18 14:18:49 Still prettier than modern cars
general 2021-05-18 14:20:07 Where do you live? Like state/country
general 2021-05-18 14:21:08 Daaaamnnn
general 2021-05-18 14:23:39 Yanno what I found out yesterday? NC only lets adults carry knives that are 4.5 inches INCLUDING the handle. But you can carry around massive guns? Like- dude! In Tejas adults can carry long swords with no licensing or anything because how often do ppl get killed in long sword attacks?
general 2021-05-18 14:24:04 No but restraints usually only operate in some places lol
general 2021-05-18 14:25:06 Lmaaaooo
general 2021-05-18 14:25:24 Bonk
general 2021-05-18 14:25:46 On the moon you can kill somebody with a gun! 🤯
general 2021-05-18 14:29:10 Eh not really a suicide joke, just a kinky one 🕺
general 2021-05-18 14:29:19 DAAAMNNNN sorry m8
general 2021-05-18 14:29:31 Sad
general 2021-05-18 14:30:08 Childhood trauma does weird things to your head when it comes to those subjects 😔
general 2021-05-18 14:31:04 Mine is mostly from fucked up American schools and the terrible culture of WI, so glad I’m back in Texas 😫
general 2021-05-18 14:31:17 I have a lot of those being a blacksmith and all
general 2021-05-18 14:31:32 OH NOOOO
general 2021-05-18 14:31:38 **OWO????**
general 2021-05-18 14:32:36 Like we saved the day and didn’t at all ignore and deny the things the Germans did to the Jews
general 2021-05-18 14:33:51 Yeah meanwhile I get to watch my grandpa balance the government propaganda that was fed to him when he was drafted and his actual life as a poor American that lived in the projects
general 2021-05-18 14:34:00 Yup
general 2021-05-18 14:34:19 The only accurate history they teach here is Texas history and that’s only in Texas.
general 2021-05-18 14:36:07 American government so pog, definitely not spreading systemic misinformation to creat blind loyalty and ignorance within their population -_-
general 2021-05-18 14:38:24 Does anyone else remember that time Germany tried to entice Mexico to declare war on the US when they were in the middle of a massive multi factional civil war?
general 2021-05-18 14:38:48 Tf did they think would happen? Texas by itself could have beat Mexico in a war at that time 🤦‍♂️
general 2021-05-18 14:39:05 Mmhmm
general 2021-05-18 14:40:33 What is he German?
general 2021-05-18 14:40:58 Lmao yeah
general 2021-05-18 14:41:33 I just hate cola in general
general 2021-05-18 14:41:43 Doesn’t matter who made it I just think it’s the worst kind of soda
general 2021-05-18 14:42:55 Yeah that’s an ugly ship
general 2021-05-18 14:44:21 My friends are all furries and it hurts me everyday. One of them is a literal fursuit maker 😔
general 2021-05-18 14:44:31 Amen
general 2021-05-18 14:45:04 The pathOWOgen
general 2021-05-18 14:45:31 You’ll release the infection into the atmosphere!!
general 2021-05-18 14:46:12 How can you be sure??
general 2021-05-18 14:46:27 Uh oh that sounds German
general 2021-07-02 01:39:40 German ain't a race lmaao
