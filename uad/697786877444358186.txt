help 2020-05-19 00:53:27 Real quick question, I built a V-1 flying bomb, and when I hit a target and set it off, it sometimes lags and doesn't do any dammage. Any fix?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:07:05 Anyone wanna start a PvP fight that isn't full of people screaming in taco bell, using turrets, spamming lag machines, and have a actual combat fight?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:08:22 Example: MI CASA XD XD XD JAO JAO SI SI SI." It's very annoying.
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:09:24 Interested.

creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:33:25 Payload deployed. I'm proud of myself now.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:45:25 Okay, some kid next to my Proton K said his 30 block rocket was better, (Mine is about 1300). He said it was way better because it was faster. Really?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:46:42 I have NO idea what he is doing now.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:09:44 .
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:01:36 Exq, it's a bit...Square.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:02:18 The turret also seems a bit too big for the body. It needs work, but not bad.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:04:12 Also, that falcon 9 dragon is like, 6 times small. Also, the legs are wrong. Not the best effort.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:06:56 Yeah..Be nice, but not gonna lie, i'm on PC. Mobile seems like total crap.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:08:02 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:08:21 Good detail, but the shape and size is just a bit off.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:10:01 Yeah. There isn't a rule that says " Rule 34, Do not post a build if people have the opinion that it sucks."
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:10:36 It's kinda fat shaming a build in some ways..
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:11:21 Note, I wasn't saying it was bad, just giving tips for later on builds.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:11:40 Well, I get that.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:13:56 Ouch. I get it that you don't want crappy plain white builds that take 5 minutes, and never work, but your age assuming off of detail.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:14:17 It's like looking at a black person, and thinking there doing crime.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:16:51 Well, you DO have a small, little point reason. Nobody under 13+ is allowed to use discord, or any other "Chat" website, but come on.

Suggestion #6041
Maybe a 500-800 Robux gamepass. "Mega rocket engines." Amount: 2000 engines. Looks like a normal rocket engine, but the flames could be purple or green. The speed of a single one could be 500-1000 speed, could be used to make very fast jets, or make carriers move at normal speeds." How is this not a good idea? It's game break-able, could be used for evil, but if it cost more than i'm worth, not everyone will have it.
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 00:51:32 Now i'm waiting for it to get shot down. Lol

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 22:11:52 Is the trapdoor extreamly broken for others?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 22:17:19 Yeah, I can lock it, open it, shut it. But my friend can't click it when locked, if I unlock it, he can click it but on his screen nothing happens. On my screen, it will open and close when he does it.
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 22:19:02 It seems to be a multi person problem.

creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:52:07 No no, this is just the cockpit, i'm bored.
Like as in an entire new build.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:55:59 Still working on the cabin fan and stick, but otherwise it's close, no?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:58:44 Do it better then, i'll wait.
bug-reports 2021-06-03 05:59:05 Fix the ragdoll bug already.
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:54:58 Okay, who pissed off the grass again?
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:55:52 My entire server is having this issue.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:49:25 Same with the Yak-38 and Mig-21.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:52:57 As soon as the Yak-38 came out in War Thunder, there has been a rise.
At first there were two uploads, and then it went over a dozen.
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:46:56 There will be a short film of the landing with LeeBigBear soon.

creations-chat 2021-06-05 22:09:25 What update?
creations-chat 2021-06-05 22:11:44 Huh, surprising that he fixed something for once.
creations-chat 2021-06-06 09:31:19 The camo is really crackjob.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:12:48 <@!377251520086933504> Add a jar of dirt.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 03:40:08 #everythingincludingeverything
creations-chat 2021-06-08 21:44:21 It kinda looks like a bunch of 1x7 beams slapped together, and then painted default red.
Just low effort.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 01:04:25 It gets beat by a microscale cockpit.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 02:50:56 It looks like a door stopper.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 20:12:15 That's gotta be the best Mig-21 i've seen.
Most people over do it, or get everything wrong.

The one with the brown camo*
bug-reports 2021-06-09 20:55:33 Locked motor's go flying away at high speeds.
Such as aircraft landing gear.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 22:04:27 Agreed.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:34:58 By the looks of it, now isn't a good time to post anything. 
At all.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:38:31 Do I look like I care? Shut up, filth.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 22:14:44 Great, now everyone is making F-5's.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:09:38 Nice, just add some detail to the front if possible.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:22:37 This is the aircraft my MiG-23MS is:
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:26:03 Yeah, I only made it in an hour or so.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 18:37:32 Cool, but a 1x1 block has more detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 18:43:16 Point is, it lacks detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:17:52 Does this look good, or should I do less/more locks?
creations-chat 2021-06-13 21:34:21 No, that's the map in the background.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 17:13:48 It looks like he forgot the bit where single rotor helicopters need their center of mass to be exactly in the center of the rotor.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 00:55:20 I get why they make them, but at the same time I don't. They're cool, but they don't really have a purpose. Like building an artillery shell without the canon itself.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:08:21 Lol
creations-chat 2021-06-22 23:42:17 Maybe do something creative with the wheels, rather than just fabric cylinders?
creations-chat 2021-06-22 23:50:36 Custom wheels or shit.
Don't just do what everybody else does.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:38:00 Yeah.
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:10:06 <@!809982182025068625> Nice Kiev class.
creations-chat 2021-07-10 21:07:26 I can only imagine how much fun it would be to destroy that with explosives and stuff.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 06:30:58 Thoughts so far?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 06:35:28 VM-T, carrying Buran prototype.
Not sure on how it will be able to fly, the VM-T will be on it's own power and stuff, normal gravity.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:02:50 <@!472265922523168768>
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:12:43 Yes. Ugly wedge car.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:43:29 I can't tell if it's the same, it looks like it is but he messed up while building it.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:45:31 Yeah, besides the LMG. He actually made it worse. Same with the colors.

The mod staff is so low, there won't really be anything done about it for awhile.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:50:25 It's kinda sad that Obc, literally just an admin, is more active than rickje.
But we still need to summon him manually.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:53:50 I do agree with this, but the game/server is really low on staff, and nobody is even thinking of fixing that.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:56:27 Why settle for a bike, when you could have a car?
It would just be nice to see some actual massive progress. It's been this way for a very long time.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:02:40 All of them, and yet there are still countless issues left unmoderated, and not even bringing up the game bug count that rickje hasn't fixed.

I've heard of the game code issues, and I know he's working on it. I'm just saying, why not hire someone else to help fix the mess that mad left.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:05:14 I know how bad the game code is, and I know that rick's working on it. I'm just saying that rick should hire a few more dev's.

And No, I didn't see it, that's on me.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:07:19 I never check there, because nothing ever visually happens. Just talk, besides what isn't even shown.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 00:34:32 It's literally the same tank, besides the color and the LMG. He made a horrible tutorial worse.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 00:37:42 How the hell do you even copy a tutorial. Isn't that just building it.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 21:49:41 International Space Station project with <@!387022912286228480> , thoughts so far?
bug-reports 2021-07-14 00:42:49 There's this ragdoll bug, when I activate the normal ragdoll my avatar body flings around and has spasms. Even in 0 gravity, and nobody else i've met has this.
creations-chat 2021-07-14 18:31:51 Agreed, he's going to be warned/blacklisted for low effort. Maybe even banned on suspicion of being -13.
creations-chat 2021-07-17 04:20:14 Nice, but maybe paint it any other color. It looks like it was blown up already.
creations-chat 2021-07-19 16:50:16 Make the "Wing" bits tilt upward like irl.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 00:41:55 Least he could do is move it back into the middle of the wings, and hide it as detail.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 21:40:49 The upper torso bit looks like the end of a flashlight.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 21:45:26 It just looks kinda weird, like it came out of a low budget 2003 power rangers movie.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 19:54:20 
creations-chat 2021-07-24 23:26:02 
creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:03:56 The recoil on that thing does more damage than the shell itself.
creations-chat 2021-07-29 13:55:57 Why does every single person who makes a TIE only 2 blocks wide in the middle? Why not three?
creations-chat 2021-07-29 14:51:23 It looks like a bird that flew into a window.
creations-chat 2021-07-29 14:53:38 Just default suspension, No keybinds, and attach a rope to each one. You don't need anything fancy or oversized.
creations-chat 2021-07-31 22:29:37 Looks like the Oil Tanker from DSS3.
creations-chat 2021-08-03 03:24:57 I joined your server, to show you my orbiter.
creations-chat 2021-08-05 03:08:49 Maybe use something more creative than cylinders for the barrel? And add an actual shell firing system.
general 2021-11-16 22:08:03 Good to see you too.
general 2021-11-16 22:10:02 I'm not here for trouble, but if any of you want to get yourselves in trouble over it, go ahead. But you can't physically do anything, at all.
general 2021-11-16 22:10:26 Oh i've done a lot of stuff in the past. But, still here.
general 2021-11-16 22:11:35 Gotta go down somehow.
general 2021-11-16 22:13:26 Point is, i'm here and i'm staying.
Cope.
general 2021-11-16 22:14:43 Permed from Reddit, Obc let me stay here though.
general 2021-11-16 22:15:23 Five, but good point.
general 2021-11-16 22:15:39 She, it's not that hard to tell.
general 2021-11-16 22:16:32 Yep.
general 2021-11-16 22:16:45 It's not around anymore though.
general 2021-11-16 22:17:11 Ct, stop trying to fight with a mod.
general 2021-11-16 22:17:50 I was banned from Reddit, not here.
Ask obc.
general 2021-11-16 22:18:55 I took a few months, glad to see this is still a dumpster fire.
