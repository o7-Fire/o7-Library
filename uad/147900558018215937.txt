plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:11:36 AYYY WHOA
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:11:40 I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS THIS
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:12:26 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:12:47 Ive made the largest plane in existance that can fly I think
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:13:38 Ok time to post all my pics lmao
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:28:17 Hey I have this cargo plane that carries 5x5x4 blocks of cargo, does that qualify
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:29:44 also how https://gyazo.com/7b255b340abe92edf05e3a867964b643.png
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:29:48 I landed my car
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:30:40 <@!294956031153405952> Thats not my ship, the car is mine
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:30:45 It landed on the ship
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:10:33 Hey guys, whats the difference between these kinds of suspensions?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:12:05 So like what would be the proper usage of both?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:12:52 Well like which one is more effective on what terrain
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:16:17 Ok well back from a smol amount of testing, the right suspension makes it smoother on rough terrain, since it allows for another angle of motion, but it causes the vehicle to understeer
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:16:34 Yep pretty much what I got out of it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 00:13:15 https://gyazo.com/664301db55599e9d2f20f0f39d62787b.png heh I found the best parking spot
