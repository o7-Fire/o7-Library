plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:55:42 so index to pinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:55:45 instead of pinky to index
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:56:12 you dont tap your thumb when u tap ur fingers
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:56:31 like u know when u waiting for something and u sittin and u just tap ur fingers on the armrest or something
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:56:32 like
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:56:37 in rapid succession
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:04 tapping index to pinky took me like an hour to learn in total
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:08 tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:13 it was harder than i thought
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:19 but now somehow
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:25 i tap better in reverse than normal
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 21:57:51 oh

plane-crazy 2019-12-11 22:09:19 ok bye now
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:12:46 my brother is such a other word for cat
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:12:50 he got his vaccinations and
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:12:56 his arms hurt from the needles
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:00 so "he cant write now"
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:14 12
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:24 YES
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:29 I KNOW
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:33 but it doesnt mean he cant write
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:38 he got an injection in his shoulders
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:13:40 not his hands
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:14:17 i got injections in my fore arms before i went to school on monday when it was a friday and i could write
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:14:21 perfeclty fine
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:14:24 and i was 5
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:14:36 i should probably re word this
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:12 On a friday when i was 5 i had 4 injections in both my forearms (cuz infection). I went to school the following monday and could write fine
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:15 my brother on the other hand
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:28 is 12, got injections in his shoulders and says he wont be able to write on monday.
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:38 therefore
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:46 i have come to the obvious conclusion
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:15:51 he is 100% a fucking poosy
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:16:10 i meant 4 in total
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:16:12 2 in each side of my forearm
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:16:22 no wait i mean like
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:16:24 2 on each arm
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:16:26 but one each side

general 2021-02-23 20:57:22 what did sound like?
general 2021-02-23 20:58:08 ooh
general 2021-02-23 20:58:25 depends where you live
general 2021-02-23 20:58:31 if ur in the EU DONT DO IT
general 2021-02-23 20:59:09 because in the EU they can put you in jail for 10 years and more for streaming without permission
general 2021-02-23 20:59:27 no
general 2021-02-23 20:59:47 they dont but discord police discord
general 2021-02-23 21:00:05 and discord probably follow eu regulations for eu citizens
general 2021-02-23 21:02:23 it's a bit more complex
general 2021-02-23 21:03:21 never said that
general 2021-02-23 21:03:40 i said if you live in the EU
general 2021-02-23 21:03:45 and also
general 2021-02-23 21:03:50 Europe doesn't mean eu
general 2021-02-23 21:04:46 eu laws are probably not going to affect you if you aren't an eu citizen
general 2021-02-23 21:05:01 unfortunately
general 2021-02-23 21:05:06 Google doesn't seem to realise that
general 2021-02-23 21:05:16 oh your uk, same
general 2021-02-23 21:05:17 but
general 2021-02-23 21:05:51 uk is a whole nother story i dont wanna get too political
general 2021-02-23 21:06:25 that picture of the Australian spider eating a bird
general 2021-02-23 21:07:08 r word is naughty
general 2021-02-23 21:07:24 but i dont see the point in banning words like that
general 2021-02-23 21:07:32 because it just gives it more meaning
general 2021-02-23 21:07:59 in order to ban words that 'offend and make fun of the mentally disabled' you would have to stop the thought of it
general 2021-02-23 21:08:09 which is impossible since mentally disabled people exist
general 2021-02-23 21:08:53 you can bypass almost any filter so easily  usually
general 2021-02-23 21:09:49 Japan is cool

plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:06:01 a lot of them seem to want to do the shitty roadman accent
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:06:09 idiots act hard too
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:06:31 also replying with Ok when confronted doesnt change anything
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:07:16 thats some level of insecurity i dont understand why people have
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:07:39 top 10 russian engineering
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:09:27 looks like you consistently do this when anyone says anything about you or that goes against what you said
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:10:06 this is what happens when people dont have fathers
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:10:22 it sounds rude or steortypical but it is true
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:11:19 the internet shows peoples true personality
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:11:52 since in real life you are under conditions that arent exactly ideal to be passive aggressive , flirtatious.
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:12:43 the internet shouldn't really be a place to abandon all your morals imo
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:12:59 just look at twitter for example, moraless place
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:13:48 most of the stuff people say online, would never be said in real life
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:14:29 show the light side
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:14:39 its hard to see geometry on the darker side
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:14:57 oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 13:15:46 no. the angle makes it out of sight

plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:30:21 i don't do PVP
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:30:36 pvp is just a 5 second turret built with max all weapons
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:31:34 pvp is buggy aff too
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:31:46 you won't believe the amount of times i cant kill someone cuz of bugs
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:32:14 entire vehicles going invisible because their model has unsynced and just stays in the air at their spawn
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:32:30 but in reality they are actualy flying around and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:33:17 unfortunately i dont spam rockets onto all my builds
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:33:24 event pvps are good tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:33:31 got restrictions on the shit you can do
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:33:34 like ww2 events
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:33:36 or ww1
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:34:10 no restriction just creates cancer
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:34:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:34:42 i wish

plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:36:15 i swear
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:36:22 the campaign is harder than multiplayer
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 14:59:49 tik tok is video form of twitter
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 15:00:07 except tik tok has comedy (to a degree)
general 2022-01-26 15:01:44 you are all losers. real men play with play doh
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 15:02:06 ye

general 2022-02-18 16:59:56 tho
general 2022-02-18 17:00:11 most people who spam it all the time will grow up
general 2022-02-18 17:00:16 you know as you get older
general 2022-02-18 17:00:35 you realise a lot of the shit you do is wrong
general 2022-02-18 17:00:54 whats unfortunate about it is the internet
general 2022-02-18 17:01:06 which i think "prolongs" behaviour like this
general 2022-02-18 17:01:37 because on the internet no one can stop you from being as big of a bastard as you want as long as it falls within law
general 2022-02-18 17:02:17 but in real life you stuff like to someone it stays because chances are you see them again like a student at your school etc
general 2022-02-18 17:02:32 and that causes problems then people realise
general 2022-02-18 17:03:19 what is actually sad
general 2022-02-18 17:03:26 is seeing 20 year olds and stuff
general 2022-02-18 17:03:53 who cant process any other word than "cope, seethe and mald"
general 2022-02-18 17:04:04 and that says a lot about someone

general 2022-02-20 20:54:18 how come?
general 2022-02-20 20:55:07 oh well trust me thats nothing compared to without the restrictions
general 2022-02-20 20:55:29 ive been in servers for roblox where the chat is just shitpost gif after shitpost gif 24 hours
general 2022-02-20 20:55:36 always those phantom forces servers man
general 2022-02-20 20:56:09 phantom forces is pretty sweaty ngl but it doesnt bother me anymore compared to what ot used to
general 2022-02-20 20:57:09 well the heavier aircraft would have a higher top speed and retain it for longer
general 2022-02-20 20:57:30 but it accelerate slower i think
general 2022-02-20 20:58:07 they are
general 2022-02-20 20:58:20 well
general 2022-02-20 20:58:28 like in normal plane crazy
general 2022-02-20 20:58:36 a flat wing panel acts as an air brake
general 2022-02-20 20:59:55 wobbling?
general 2022-02-20 21:00:10 ah that
general 2022-02-20 21:01:43 the wings produce the same lift whether the plane is heavy or not
general 2022-02-20 21:02:04 it just wont be enough to overcome the Weight of a too heavy object
general 2022-02-20 21:03:04 its like cartoons
general 2022-02-20 21:03:08 they just drop
general 2022-02-20 21:06:10 <@217336009455566848> could we get a sliding block like in besiege where it moves over a single axis? like a piston but both ways technically
general 2022-02-20 21:06:58 plane crazy 2 gameplay trailer 😱
general 2022-02-20 21:08:16 i mean thats how it works irl
general 2022-02-20 21:08:24 but you are moving
general 2022-02-20 21:08:29 which overcomes the side force
general 2022-02-20 21:08:32 unless its really big
general 2022-02-20 21:08:46 which is why you see planes side slipping on landing when its really windy
general 2022-02-20 21:08:58 they are flying straight but sideways
general 2022-02-20 21:09:02 helicopters do that too
general 2022-02-20 21:09:29 pvp is just too buggy to play imo
general 2022-02-20 21:09:39 its fun in private servers
general 2022-02-20 21:09:43 in public its a mess
general 2022-02-20 21:09:51 the damn lag and server issues

general 2022-02-20 21:14:34 OH I KNOW
general 2022-02-20 21:14:37 what to do
general 2022-02-20 21:16:14 <@217336009455566848> tip jets for helicopters (rockets on the end of the blades) produce no torque, which means you can fly without a tail rotor but ingame this still spins the vehicle quite a bit
general 2022-02-20 21:17:33 gliding aircraft can irl
general 2022-02-20 21:19:18 imagine we could recreate the harriers pegasus engine in plane crazy

general 2022-02-21 12:43:26 nah that isnt q black pigeon
general 2022-02-21 12:43:30 thats a normal pigeon
general 2022-02-21 12:43:39 but you do get pigeons that are proper black
general 2022-02-21 12:43:46 they look cool af ngl
general 2022-02-21 12:44:33 <@707777796843372554> have you seen pink necked green pigeon
general 2022-02-21 12:44:59 yes
general 2022-02-21 12:45:25 doxxing <:Trololo:924295063826231346>
general 2022-02-21 12:45:52 you can kind of
general 2022-02-21 12:46:50 in war thunder sim you rely more on the enemy flying into your sights than you do in realistic where you track
general 2022-02-21 12:47:09 it doesnt take long to learn to fly but it takes long to learn to aim
general 2022-02-21 12:47:57 what kind of hats
general 2022-02-21 12:48:21 countering bullet drop isnt much in a plane
general 2022-02-21 12:48:24 you only shoot when you are within like 400 meters
general 2022-02-21 12:48:44 but whats a bit harder
general 2022-02-21 12:49:01 when you are doing a turn or pulling up and firing
general 2022-02-21 12:49:19 so you gotta pull up even more to hit
general 2022-02-21 12:49:35 which wont work in all planes obviously
general 2022-02-21 12:50:08 because aircraft have a max rate for turning
general 2022-02-21 12:50:13 but yeah
general 2022-02-21 12:50:34 its generally easier to shoot someone down if you go behind them rather than shoot side on when you have to turn
general 2022-02-21 12:51:01 they are fun tho
general 2022-02-21 12:51:06 i like engine noise
general 2022-02-21 12:51:25 ngl
general 2022-02-21 12:52:20 all fun and games till the nerf gun explodes
general 2022-02-21 12:52:46 enlisted
general 2022-02-21 12:52:48 also no
general 2022-02-21 12:52:59 infantry in war thunder would be pointless
general 2022-02-21 12:53:09 no one would play as infantry
general 2022-02-21 12:53:32 tf is cavalry gonna do to 152mm HE <:Trololo:924295063826231346>
general 2022-02-21 12:54:07 THATS REAL LIFE
general 2022-02-21 12:54:13 I'm talking about war thunder
general 2022-02-21 12:54:23 theres literally no point to play infantry in war thunder
general 2022-02-21 12:54:32 no
general 2022-02-21 12:55:01 because you will instantly get machine gunned to death by the other tanks
general 2022-02-21 12:55:50 its already difficult enough playing as a car and getting machine gunned, its gonna be even more difficult to do the same at walking speed without any form of armour
general 2022-02-21 12:56:11 infantry and tanks make sense in post scriptum and stuff. thats what the game is built around
general 2022-02-21 12:56:27 but In war thunder where everyone is tanks or aircraft theres no point
general 2022-02-21 12:57:19 devastating anti tank guns? yeah good luck setting that up in the middle of being shot at by tanks
general 2022-02-21 12:57:38 piat isnt an anti tank gun
general 2022-02-21 12:57:45 no
general 2022-02-21 12:57:59 its a type of motar
general 2022-02-21 12:58:03 its not a gun bruh
general 2022-02-21 12:58:20 oh my god
general 2022-02-21 12:58:28 do you think the bazooka is an anti tank gun?
general 2022-02-21 12:58:44 do you think an anti tank missile is a gun?
general 2022-02-21 12:58:49 yes
general 2022-02-21 12:58:58 yes it does
general 2022-02-21 12:59:09 it makes a big difference
general 2022-02-21 12:59:33 horns have nothing to do with anti tank guns man
general 2022-02-21 13:00:00 the 17pdr is an anti tank gun, the PIAT isnt
general 2022-02-21 13:00:12 its not a gun man
general 2022-02-21 13:00:34 and neither is the bazooka, panzershrek, panzerfaust, rpg
general 2022-02-21 13:00:50 they arent
general 2022-02-21 13:01:05 my point is they arent guns
general 2022-02-21 13:02:30 but they still arent guns
general 2022-02-21 13:02:48 anyway
general 2022-02-21 13:02:59 a good anti tank gun takes a bit to set up
general 2022-02-21 13:03:08 things like pak40, 17pdr
general 2022-02-21 13:03:14 it would be useless ingame
general 2022-02-21 13:03:46 unless your enemy is afk, spending a whole minute or two to set up a gun isnt gonna work
general 2022-02-21 13:04:37 good luck even getting to the place before tanks
general 2022-02-21 13:05:16 in war thunder?
general 2022-02-21 13:05:26 ah

general 2022-04-30 15:46:33 I dont like the idea that my earphone could fall out so
general 2022-04-30 15:46:36 wired for me
general 2022-04-30 15:47:00 wired headphones arent any more bulky than bluetooth headphones
general 2022-04-30 15:47:40 I dont listen to music when im out
general 2022-04-30 15:47:47 because I am paying attention to my surroundings
general 2022-04-30 15:47:59 Especially in a city like London
general 2022-04-30 15:48:09 there are so many things that can fuck up your day
general 2022-04-30 15:48:43 romanians (thieves),  knife gangs, cars, cyclists,

general 2022-04-30 15:49:54 rather that than need to charge them
general 2022-04-30 15:50:06 because I know how to wrap the chord up properly
general 2022-04-30 15:50:49 So is wrapping a chord
general 2022-04-30 15:50:56 literally takes 5 seconds
general 2022-04-30 15:52:14 Well it takes 5 seconds but I spend 30 because I make it look nice 😊

general 2022-05-01 08:48:26 and i hate their accents
general 2022-05-01 08:48:34 it sounds stupid as fuck
general 2022-05-01 08:49:02 they dont talk like that in london unfortunately

general 2022-05-01 08:50:59 dont look if you have a fear of holes
general 2022-05-01 08:51:02 this a crumpet

general 2022-05-01 08:52:09 I know
general 2022-05-01 08:52:43 I'm rank V
general 2022-05-01 08:53:06 When you get the Centurion Mk1 it's so good
general 2022-05-01 08:53:18 the Centurion Mk1 can survive long 88 frontally
general 2022-05-01 08:53:30 and it stops panther 75 completely
general 2022-05-01 08:53:35 atleast from a glaccis
general 2022-05-01 08:53:45 Dont go concept 3
general 2022-05-01 08:53:48 go Challenger first
general 2022-05-01 08:53:52 sabot 🥵
general 2022-05-01 08:54:06 you can pen panther glaccis fontally
general 2022-05-01 08:54:15 and you can pen the tiger 2 frontally through the LFP
general 2022-05-01 08:54:58 You will grind faster if you go Challenger
general 2022-05-01 08:55:06 because it has higher rp%
general 2022-05-01 08:56:10 brw
general 2022-05-01 08:56:13 btw
general 2022-05-01 08:56:23 <@509857272651055126> sherman firefly is shit
general 2022-05-01 08:56:45 the sherman chassis is god awful. no neutral steering, no speed, cant climb hills
general 2022-05-01 08:56:59 the gun is good but it's just the hull that makes the tank awful
general 2022-05-01 08:57:11 No
general 2022-05-01 08:57:36 You are playing the heavies then 💀
general 2022-05-01 08:57:56 More than half the tanks at low br are cruisers and they go about 52kmh
general 2022-05-01 08:58:09 wdym never
general 2022-05-01 08:59:15 Cromwell 1, Cromwell V, Avenger, Challenger,  Crusader 3, the Sarcs, literally all the reserve vehicles,
general 2022-05-01 08:59:33 37kmh isn't slow but it isn't fast
general 2022-05-01 09:00:08 https://tenor.com/view/chernobyl-not-great-not-terrible-average-gif-14312799
general 2022-05-01 09:00:34 30 backwards sure they do
general 2022-05-01 09:00:40 only wheels go 30 backwards at low br
general 2022-05-01 09:01:02 You are comparing a 1968 vehicle to 1943 💀
general 2022-05-01 09:01:22 no
general 2022-05-01 09:01:29 Centurion has 12kmh reverse
general 2022-05-01 09:01:53 the cruisers do, the reverse speed got silent nerfed aswell
general 2022-05-01 09:02:14 it used to be 4kmh, then they reduced it to 3kmh for a year, then with wind of change they made it 2kmh reverse
general 2022-05-01 09:02:31 those scummy eastern european bastards nerf britain so much
general 2022-05-01 09:02:34 for no reason
general 2022-05-01 09:03:34 because gaijin are bastards
general 2022-05-01 09:03:57 theres so many things wrong with the british tree because they wont implement it correctly
general 2022-05-01 09:04:22 you know the Cromwel V has 34mm of armour taken off the frontal plate
general 2022-05-01 09:04:55 also all cromwells ingame have 12mm less turret armour on the turret front
general 2022-05-01 09:05:10 They even fucking say it on their website but they dont put it ingame
general 2022-05-01 09:05:43 BALANCING???
general 2022-05-01 09:06:00 YOU DONT REMOVE OVER 30MM OF ARMOUR FROM THE FRONT OF A TANK FOR BALANCING
general 2022-05-01 09:06:04 NO
general 2022-05-01 09:07:00 also you know what pisses me off
general 2022-05-01 09:07:50 4 of the Centurion mk1 had a 20mm polsten machine gun. They wont add it ingame because "too little use" but they give germany a single expensive prototype that never even entered service 💀
general 2022-05-01 09:10:32 Also you know the meteor
general 2022-05-01 09:10:42 It had Hispano Mk V if I remember correctly
general 2022-05-01 09:10:51 but only gets Hispano Mk2 ingame
general 2022-05-01 09:10:57 yes the jet

general 2022-05-01 09:30:00 Yes
general 2022-05-01 09:30:39 FV4202 is a really nice tank apart from reverse
general 2022-05-01 09:31:28 I think the FV4202 looks cooler than a centurion
general 2022-05-01 09:31:35 centurion is beautiful but
general 2022-05-01 09:31:47 FV4202 has some nice ass hull
general 2022-05-01 09:32:05 Gotta see that

creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:21:56 but thats legitimate logic
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:24:40 I downvote things if I just dont like them. If I even downvote. I dont downvote noobs who just started the game because no point adding another to the 70 downvotes expert ranks are going to spam at them and im not a bastard like that. but I downvote experts
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:27:54 Because most expert ranks are overly critical bastards towards unranked people or just people playing to have fun.

So, I'm going to be overly critical towards expert ranks seen as they do the same. Problem?

general 2022-05-06 03:49:17 woah
general 2022-05-06 03:51:04 Geez
general 2022-05-06 03:51:44 To be fair I would have done the same in WWII if I was churchill
general 2022-05-06 03:52:15 Guy carpet bombed the shit out of germany as revenge for the blitz
general 2022-05-06 03:52:21 You know what I dont understand
general 2022-05-06 03:52:50 The Bombing of Dresden is a "war crime" but the Blitz isnt, how does that make sense
general 2022-05-06 03:53:55 Germans crying about war crimes done to them during WWII is the most ironic thing to be honest
general 2022-05-06 03:54:00 War crimes are not good tho
general 2022-05-06 03:54:16 Just classify both as a War crime
general 2022-05-06 03:54:21 Which is what they are
general 2022-05-06 03:54:57 <@509857272651055126> Still cringe you bought premium
general 2022-05-06 03:55:08 It's white that means he can buy it
general 2022-05-06 03:55:38 Yes
general 2022-05-06 03:55:42 Problem?
general 2022-05-06 03:56:35 <@509857272651055126> Centurion Mk1 will stop panthers on the glaccis, and will not stop a Long 88 from penetrating, but the sprawl is heavily reduced and it also doesnt detonate
general 2022-05-06 03:57:14 I took a long 88 to the front and my entire crew was fine, but I died because the shell actually hit a single  piece of ammo in my ready rack
general 2022-05-06 03:57:56 It doesnt, 17pdr Shot Mk4 is good even at 6.0, better than most tanks of the same BR
general 2022-05-06 03:58:10 No shit, the Swedish dont use the centurion mk1
general 2022-05-06 03:58:40 Tall hull
general 2022-05-06 03:59:57 also <@509857272651055126> when you get APDS, it's beautiful watching panthers non pen your front plate and you just send a sabot through all 5 of their crew members
general 2022-05-06 04:00:13 and yes, APDS will 1 shot if you aim correctly
general 2022-05-06 04:00:49 No
general 2022-05-06 04:01:01 Aim correctly
general 2022-05-06 04:01:32 If you are unable to 1 shot, shoot the side with the hull on the gunner side
general 2022-05-06 04:01:40 With panther for example,
general 2022-05-06 04:02:14 Actually
general 2022-05-06 04:02:50 shooting slightly right of centre on the panther 1 shots almost every time what am I talking about 2 shotting for?
general 2022-05-06 04:03:06 Just centre mass the son of a bitch
general 2022-05-06 04:03:37 Leopard 1 has no armour
general 2022-05-06 04:04:36 Britain is just extra advanced with technology 😎
general 2022-05-06 04:06:29 I played britain for just over a year now
general 2022-05-06 04:06:39 For ground anyway
general 2022-05-06 04:07:25 It's hard as fuck at first to actually get good at Britain but once you are able to utilise the tanks correct
general 2022-05-06 04:07:29 shits powerful af

general 2022-05-06 04:09:02 nice hacks
general 2022-05-06 04:09:42 Air battle mechanics need a massive revamp to be honest
general 2022-05-06 04:09:57 A single 20mm shell shouldnt rip the wing off of a huge bomber
general 2022-05-06 04:10:16 or 23mm
general 2022-05-06 04:10:19 those russians
general 2022-05-06 04:11:04 How the hell could a B-25 rip a ship in half?
general 2022-05-06 04:11:22 with a 30mm gun
general 2022-05-06 04:12:18 The Tirpitz, didnt rip in half, after being bombed with Tallboys, the Bismark didnt rip in half, the Hood didnt rip in half
general 2022-05-06 04:13:28 Maxim will prove his machine gun works, by chopping a ship in half with bullets <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-05-07 15:13:22 Ireland just elected basically the fucking IRA into power and germany is having fun with skyrocketing fuel prices and a shortage of fuels. Germany is also packed full of illegal immigrants which... you know
general 2022-05-07 15:15:26 The IRA blow up children and civilians
general 2022-05-07 15:17:32 HE SAYS A-S UAL ANND LIKES MALE AT THE SAME TIME BRUH 💀 💀

general 2022-05-07 15:18:44 welcome back
general 2022-05-07 15:19:57 Everyone is homophobic if they don't like you clearly 💀
general 2022-05-07 15:20:07 Yoo
general 2022-05-07 15:20:31 <@719168864705052802> Remember to thin your paints
general 2022-05-07 15:21:02 Do so yes
general 2022-05-07 15:22:04 <@719168864705052802> do you have PVA glue by any chance?
general 2022-05-07 15:22:39 No no
general 2022-05-07 15:22:47 it's plastic cement
general 2022-05-07 15:22:54 Literally melts the plastic together
general 2022-05-07 15:23:47 You wanna be careful with the plastic glue. If you get it on your fingers it can leave fingerprints in the plastic
general 2022-05-07 15:25:32 Anyway, if you are able to pick up PVA glue do so. It is good for putting on the canopies of the aircraft and if you thin it down a bit you can apply to the model before you place any decals. It makes it easier to apply them and they appear nicer
general 2022-05-07 15:25:57 Well you have to use it to build the model
general 2022-05-07 15:26:30 I wont distract you now tho, do go watch some videos about it as they can explain better than me. And goodluck with the model
general 2022-05-07 15:28:09 No, first time I been nice to him
general 2022-05-07 15:34:36 The glue is transparent
general 2022-05-07 15:35:30 Only gonna be like 15cm across
general 2022-05-07 15:36:38 I remember my first model
general 2022-05-07 15:36:41 I was 8 years old
general 2022-05-07 15:36:52 1/76 King Tiger from Airfix
general 2022-05-07 15:37:24 I like their aircraft but those tanks are just 🤢

general 2022-05-19 18:04:51 YOU ARE A POSTER
general 2022-05-19 18:04:55 HOW ARE YOU SPEAKING
general 2022-05-19 18:05:01 FLAT STANLEY IRL
general 2022-05-19 18:05:31 4x 7.7 isn't going to do much at mid and high br
general 2022-05-19 18:05:40 Rely on your 20s and aim good
general 2022-05-19 18:05:56 8x 7.7 is good shit
general 2022-05-19 18:07:00 I like the guns on the early spitfires
general 2022-05-19 18:07:05 Wdym
general 2022-05-19 18:07:15 You can set fires
general 2022-05-19 18:07:28 No?
general 2022-05-19 18:07:52 <:hmm:957230999132045342>
general 2022-05-19 18:07:52 I always wing shred
general 2022-05-19 18:08:16 Shredding the wings after setting both HE-111 engines on fire is beautiful
general 2022-05-19 18:08:54 My main issue with the early spitfires is cooling and it's lack of speed retebtion but cooling isn't the worst
general 2022-05-19 18:09:49 French 7.5 is strangely effective
general 2022-05-19 18:11:33 20mm Hispano is so good except cooling
general 2022-05-19 18:15:53 I'm not very good with 109s
general 2022-05-19 18:16:09 I have never used nose mounted guns
general 2022-05-19 18:16:12 That much
general 2022-05-19 18:16:26 I love my wing mounted
general 2022-05-19 18:16:55 Nah not really. Too used to dogfighting with spitfires and early french aircraft
general 2022-05-19 18:18:57 I play on 400 or 600m convergence
general 2022-05-19 18:19:05 But I never really fire until 300m
general 2022-05-19 18:19:25 Because I play sim so firing further than 300m is something I'm not used to
general 2022-05-19 18:19:41 In sim you are shooting from like 100m away
general 2022-05-19 18:20:43 I do that with the stuka. Then I use my turret to shoot down the bomber from underneath
general 2022-05-19 18:21:36 They never do that. They can't
general 2022-05-19 18:22:08 Once I brought a fucking nimrod to a 4.7 sim game and I spawned in it
general 2022-05-19 18:22:12 Idk how but the game let me

general 2022-05-24 18:08:39 Also, I want 6pdr APDS 🥺
general 2022-05-24 18:09:20 Answer is simple, play Centurion MK1 and dominate
general 2022-05-24 18:09:54 The Centurion MK1 can take a long 88 at 100m to the glaccis and survive because the shell won't detonate
general 2022-05-24 18:12:01 Centurion MK1 glaccis is very good
general 2022-05-24 18:12:18 It can be penned by panthers... untill like 20cm away when it cant

general 2022-05-26 13:02:14 Fr trapdoors aren't as good
general 2022-05-26 13:02:22 Plus, trapdoors can't go in the middle
general 2022-05-26 13:02:46 And they only bond on 3 side. Which is useful for some scenarios but not so useful for others
general 2022-05-26 13:03:06 Wings go in the middle
general 2022-05-26 13:03:17 Trapdoors dont
general 2022-05-26 13:05:14 You want to use as little motorlock as possible tho
general 2022-05-26 13:05:26 Yes
general 2022-05-26 13:05:52 No point making a small plane 2000 blocks
general 2022-05-26 13:06:23 That's just stupid. Fuck off and go make your own game at that point
general 2022-05-26 13:06:58 Mfs really spend 2 months on their build and shit on others for not doing the same
general 2022-05-26 13:07:51 I know
general 2022-05-26 13:08:01 But it's bloody ridiculous
general 2022-05-26 13:08:52 Some people here have absolutely no life outside of plane crazy
general 2022-05-26 13:09:13 Against 1 other submission which probably took 1 hour
general 2022-05-26 13:09:31 Ues
general 2022-05-26 13:09:33 Yes
general 2022-05-26 13:10:22 Taking 2 months and expecting everyone else to aswell*
general 2022-05-26 13:11:15 I'm not talking about trap doors
general 2022-05-26 13:11:24 I don't care
general 2022-05-26 13:11:59 I'm not interested in sitting their admiring it or some shit I'm just making a point here
general 2022-05-26 13:13:09 I don't know I just ended up going on a tangent I guess
general 2022-05-26 13:15:36 Yeah it should, what I mean is if you are making an F-16 for example, it would be silly to make it 1500 blocks through motorolock. At that point if you want to make detail you may aswell just open up blender or something
general 2022-05-26 13:16:44 So you are doing it for ego
general 2022-05-26 13:16:45 bruh
general 2022-05-26 13:31:45 China shouldn't exist
general 2022-05-26 13:31:54 China should be taken over by the UK
general 2022-05-26 13:36:14 I just hate when people act like a bastard when giving "feedback". Giving feedback isn't the same as shitting on everything they have done
general 2022-05-26 13:37:24 Hint hint that isn't feedback.  Telling someone to straight up restart isn't telling them what's wrong with their current build and how to improve it
general 2022-05-26 13:38:02 Nice pfp 😎
general 2022-05-26 13:39:27 Like I said, telling someone to restart isn't giving feedback on their build
general 2022-05-26 13:40:15 I read what you said
general 2022-05-26 13:40:20 That still isn't feedback
general 2022-05-26 13:42:41 No, I'm not saying give a tutorial at all. I just mean tell them a general idea of what they should do. If your idea of a response to "how do I fix my canopy" is "restart the build and motorlock the canopy" then that isn't exactly helping their current build. That is telling them to make another build.
general 2022-05-26 13:44:03 You aren't getting it
general 2022-05-26 13:44:16 You are telling them to make ANOTHER build
general 2022-05-26 13:44:33 It does make sense
general 2022-05-26 13:49:11 Your personal standards, no. But for others, yes (to a degree of course)
general 2022-05-26 13:50:03 <@781171443437273109> 😡
general 2022-05-26 13:50:32 Assuming you actually give advice and not just shit on their build like always?
general 2022-05-26 13:51:10 Like I said "restart" isn't advice
general 2022-05-26 13:51:47 Isn't
general 2022-05-26 13:52:19 That wouldn't be the same build then
general 2022-05-26 13:55:23 Well first, when does "can't fix" apply? When it doesn't apply to your standards instantly or when the build is actually hopeless?
general 2022-05-26 13:59:00 Respectable
general 2022-05-26 14:00:41 No <:clueless:942802644043464734> This isn't going anyway
general 2022-05-26 14:00:46 I still think you are wrong tho
general 2022-05-26 14:02:23 Why
general 2022-05-26 14:03:13 Understandable
general 2022-05-26 14:03:21 I thought you meant restarting 5 times in a row

general 2022-06-01 22:06:49 I'd rather use The 2b
general 2022-06-01 22:07:11 Rip climbrate
general 2022-06-01 22:07:17 1a climbrate is just beautiful
general 2022-06-01 22:07:22 6km in 5 minutes
general 2022-06-01 22:07:29 ho
general 2022-06-01 22:07:30 hi
general 2022-06-01 22:08:20 They are all slow
general 2022-06-01 22:08:31 It's not till the Mk9 they get faster
general 2022-06-01 22:08:57 also 6k in 5 minutes isn't a lie if anyone wondering
general 2022-06-01 22:09:11 Spitfire 1a climbrate is 19.5 I believe
general 2022-06-01 22:09:28 It's great
general 2022-06-01 22:09:57 It's the reason I don't use the V series spitfires much
general 2022-06-01 22:10:12 I love bomber intercepting
general 2022-06-01 22:10:35 Imagine engine cooling
general 2022-06-01 22:10:40 Unless you are 109
general 2022-06-01 22:10:54 Early 109 have same cooling problems as spitfires
general 2022-06-01 22:10:59 And similar climbrat3
general 2022-06-01 22:11:02 but less turn
general 2022-06-01 22:11:04 and less gun
general 2022-06-01 22:11:20 I just leave it on auto
general 2022-06-01 22:11:39 No point using MEC in realistic battles

general 2022-06-01 22:13:03 Nah spitfires need radiator on 200%
general 2022-06-01 22:13:27 If your oil or water overheats below 220kmh you are fucked
general 2022-06-01 22:13:36 You won't be able to speed up again and cool down your engine

general 2022-06-07 16:19:40 I think I passed it but if lucky enough possibly a low B
general 2022-06-07 16:20:24 It's funny af watching Americans try to turnfight spitfires
general 2022-06-07 16:20:44 What does that mean
general 2022-06-07 16:21:00 No
general 2022-06-07 16:21:01 Tell me
general 2022-06-07 16:22:07 You can't fly a plane in reverse
general 2022-06-07 16:22:18 Unless it was upside down and the propeller was reversed
general 2022-06-07 16:22:54 Well I don't know what it means to reverse an aircraft so this means nothing to me
general 2022-06-07 16:23:26 Oh
general 2022-06-07 16:23:48 I mean yeah that's not hard
general 2022-06-07 16:23:51 Just fly upwards
general 2022-06-07 16:23:57 Spitfire has dog shit energy retention
general 2022-06-07 16:24:57 EWWWW
general 2022-06-07 16:26:48 Only for IR missiles
general 2022-06-07 16:27:01 That's why boom and zoom
general 2022-06-07 16:27:12 Spirfire can't turnfight at 600kmh anyway
general 2022-06-07 16:27:26 Best speed for spitfire is around 350kmh
general 2022-06-07 16:27:48 Happened to me 😭 But there was 2 corsairs on me
general 2022-06-07 16:27:51 and I was 6km high
general 2022-06-07 16:28:18 I don't fucking knoe
general 2022-06-07 16:28:25 I was at 6km bomber hunting
general 2022-06-07 16:28:36 these 2 mfs saw me from 4km high and climbed to me
general 2022-06-07 16:28:57 That's ex
general 2022-06-07 16:28:59 ez
general 2022-06-07 16:29:09 The hurricane has shit speed so it can't turnfight
general 2022-06-07 16:29:17 Turnfighting in a hurricane is stupid
general 2022-06-07 16:29:48 Source: I tried turnfighting in a hurricane
general 2022-06-07 16:29:58 You lose all your speed and then all your turning capability
general 2022-06-07 16:30:09 and roll rate
general 2022-06-07 16:31:00 I hate ITP
general 2022-06-07 16:31:58 Spitfire is ultimate space climber
general 2022-06-07 16:32:04 19.5m/s climb rate
general 2022-06-07 16:32:12 You can get to 6km in 5 minutes
general 2022-06-07 16:33:17 Also
general 2022-06-07 16:33:34 Kinda annoying how a 1938 aircraft is the same br as 1942 german aircraft

creations-chat 2022-06-10 22:21:47 <@793132196810588200> I don't get why you shit on others for their builds that are more detailed and properly scaled when this is the best you can produce. Don't get me wrong, I like this, but it obviously isn't as good as other versions people have made. And that's fine. Just don't be an ass about people's things like that

general 2022-06-10 22:36:58 Literally just Normandy beach
general 2022-06-10 22:39:27 The soviets were fucking useless as an army. It's mostly just sheer soviet numbers and the fact that german supply lines were stretched so far along with poor ass weather conditions that make it a logistical nightmare to get muntions, food and troops to the front lines. Not to  mention that Germany was fighting Britain in Africa at the same time so they were split into 2 fronts. By the time the soviets were pushing back against Germany, they were fighting in the rest of Europe too
general 2022-06-10 22:40:34 Not the same information at all

general 2022-06-13 12:53:27 I saw a post on reddit about 2 weeks ago
general 2022-06-13 12:53:39 talking about the increase in foodbanka under the conservative party
general 2022-06-13 12:53:50 But I think that's more a corrolation than causation
general 2022-06-13 12:54:25 Poverty has certainly decreased since the 1980s and the reason for foodbanks may be that they always should have been there but just weren't
general 2022-06-13 12:54:42 I was in this situation as a kid

general 2022-06-14 15:38:20 GCSE Math isn't even that hard it's just that no one revises really

general 2022-06-18 21:54:48 wha
general 2022-06-18 21:54:57 What's wrong with that ship
general 2022-06-18 21:55:16 The perspective is all wacky
general 2022-06-18 21:56:56 That doesn't matter
general 2022-06-18 21:57:06 I don't need a thumb to fly the spitfire
general 2022-06-18 21:57:13 I would irl to fire it but
general 2022-06-18 21:57:21 I could easily just make a prosthetic for that
general 2022-06-18 21:57:53 Oh yeah
general 2022-06-18 21:58:00 I was thinking about my thumb being removed entirely
general 2022-06-18 21:58:06 Still
general 2022-06-18 21:58:14 I could still fly a spitfire with a missing thumb
general 2022-06-18 21:58:38 I could fly a plane irl <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-06-18 21:58:53 I have played war thunder sim I can land a 747 in an emergency <:troll:957709339207024770>
general 2022-06-18 21:59:49 Wooo spitfire prototype
general 2022-06-18 22:00:25 Spitfire is just an amazing aircraft
general 2022-06-18 22:01:03 I saw a video from the US national gallery or some shit i forgor the name of the channel
general 2022-06-18 22:01:21 And they said The spitfire won the war or some shit along the lines of that
general 2022-06-18 22:01:23 And to be fair
general 2022-06-18 22:01:25 It's true
general 2022-06-18 22:01:38 If the Battle Of Britain was lost I'm sure Germany would have won
general 2022-06-18 22:02:05 Yes
general 2022-06-18 22:02:17 The US against Japan and the Axks
general 2022-06-18 22:02:19 axis
general 2022-06-18 22:02:52 Well rememeber Germany wouldn't have the resource issues if they had won the battle of Britain
general 2022-06-18 22:03:40 Also
general 2022-06-18 22:03:57 Germany would have had access to spitfires after invading the UK
general 2022-06-18 22:04:06 And they would have used it I'm sure
general 2022-06-18 22:04:17 No they wouldn't
general 2022-06-18 22:04:43 You won't have resource issues when you are in control of all of Europe
general 2022-06-18 22:05:23 They would get access to all the British Navy
general 2022-06-18 22:06:05 Bismark was pretty cool, until they destroyed the Hood and Britain destroyed the Bismark 10 days later with fucking pre war biplanes as revenge
general 2022-06-18 22:06:30 Nah
general 2022-06-18 22:06:33 It's tradition
general 2022-06-18 22:06:48 Ship naming is alright

general 2022-06-18 22:15:35 I think that was the Brittanic
general 2022-06-18 22:15:46 I think the Olympia was struck by a torpedo
general 2022-06-18 22:16:43 Brittanic struck a mine in WWI and sank
general 2022-06-18 22:16:52 Yes

general 2022-06-20 10:47:00 Oh my god
general 2022-06-20 10:47:05 Creations incident number 2
general 2022-06-20 10:48:05 I want to participate in but I know I'll die
general 2022-06-20 10:48:09 They will
general 2022-06-20 10:48:25 I got banned for a month for posting a picture of a helicopter in there
general 2022-06-20 10:48:39 And it wasn't because I was on "2 warns already"
general 2022-06-20 10:48:48 Hyperbit is an asshole and warned me twice for the same thing
general 2022-06-20 10:48:52 Just to ban me
general 2022-06-20 10:48:59 I don't even know him but he has a grudge against me
general 2022-06-20 10:49:07 Helicopter
general 2022-06-20 10:51:21 Hi dexter_2017
general 2022-06-20 10:51:30 Are you still 5?
general 2022-06-20 10:51:45 (He's 5 years old if anyone is wondering)
general 2022-06-20 10:52:38 All you need to do is post anything in there and they warn you for it
general 2022-06-20 10:53:02 They know
general 2022-06-20 10:53:17 I sent 1 message the first time and I got banned
general 2022-06-20 10:53:20 This is unfair
general 2022-06-20 10:54:54 Apparently posting a  realhelicopter in creations is shitposting and then 4 hours later it's "continuing to shitpost after being told to stop" even tho you haven't even been online since because you were studying or some shit
general 2022-06-20 10:56:45 I got warned by rbk I believe it was originally, for 2 things and you know those warns were fair enough
general 2022-06-20 10:56:54 But then hyperbit comes along 1 hour later after I got warned
general 2022-06-20 10:56:57 He warns me again
general 2022-06-20 10:57:00 Then he bans me
general 2022-06-20 10:57:10 Then I tell yousuf the situation and he removes the ban
general 2022-06-20 10:57:14 Then hyperbit bans me again
general 2022-06-20 10:57:34 5 hours later after the original ban
general 2022-06-20 10:57:42 Because "continued to shitpost" like I said earlier
general 2022-06-20 10:57:51 And that's why I fucking hate Hyperbit
general 2022-06-20 10:58:03 Also why I didn't type in creations today
general 2022-06-20 10:58:16 I know his dirty ass is out there to get me
general 2022-06-20 11:02:03 Said warns if anyone is interested
general 2022-06-20 11:02:18 As you can see, only 2 warns and then I was banned without a warn
general 2022-06-20 11:02:25 then when i was unbanned I was banned again
general 2022-06-20 11:03:09 The first 2 warns are justified yes
general 2022-06-20 11:03:16 The 3rd "warn" isn't
general 2022-06-20 11:04:08 There is none
general 2022-06-20 11:04:12 But he said I was warned
general 2022-06-20 11:04:18 Even tho I wasn't
general 2022-06-20 11:05:25 I'm still pissed about it 😡

general 2022-06-24 07:32:03 Bri'ish F35
general 2022-06-24 07:32:19 I remember some American saying Britain crashed all F35s
general 2022-06-24 07:32:33 2 crashes were Japanese, 1 crash was British and 4 were American
general 2022-06-24 07:32:56 Idiot pilot flew off the carrier for some reason
general 2022-06-24 07:33:16 Idk what happened fully tho
general 2022-06-24 07:33:31 Like if it was landing or takeoff I have no clue
general 2022-06-24 07:34:21 
general 2022-06-24 07:34:38 We have more than 1
general 2022-06-24 07:35:47 No
general 2022-06-24 07:36:04 An American said all 5 F35 crashes were British
general 2022-06-24 07:36:20 I just worded it poorly
general 2022-06-24 07:37:19 Chicken Butt
general 2022-06-24 07:37:40 He's here to kill commies 😱
general 2022-06-24 07:38:53 Step 1: out turn them
general 2022-06-24 07:39:16 I don't know what the F8 is
general 2022-06-24 07:39:19 Out turn them
general 2022-06-24 07:39:43 Flares only work against IR
general 2022-06-24 07:40:04 Atleast your pilot can safely eject
general 2022-06-24 07:40:52 It knows where you are too
general 2022-06-24 07:41:44 Why do that when I can spend 5 quid on a membrane keyboard
general 2022-06-24 07:42:19 It only 2 bushes
general 2022-06-24 07:42:46 I only have 2 bushes so
general 2022-06-24 07:42:47 I use them
general 2022-06-24 07:42:52 3 quid is fine
general 2022-06-24 07:43:09 I must get off bus now
general 2022-06-24 07:53:56 I only teamkill if someone shoots at me
general 2022-06-24 07:54:13 I actually did that once
general 2022-06-24 07:54:22 But that was a long time ago
general 2022-06-24 07:54:30 But anyway I prefer to shoot them down
general 2022-06-24 07:54:36 Aim trainer
general 2022-06-24 07:55:16 And these mfs always say "I was just shooting the air I wasn't tryna tk you"
general 2022-06-24 07:55:31 So anyone who even fires a second burst at me that's it they are done
general 2022-06-24 07:55:57 I quite enjoy killing asshole teamates
general 2022-06-24 07:56:50 Rip
general 2022-06-24 07:57:04 I have an idea
general 2022-06-24 07:57:19 You know how in most dogfights where you are too fast you end up Split S ing
general 2022-06-24 07:57:40 What if instead of engaging in the Split S you just fly upwards and then do a turn instead
general 2022-06-24 07:57:50 Because most split S are very horizontal
general 2022-06-24 07:58:09 No
general 2022-06-24 07:58:20 I'm not gonna stall myself at 100m above the ground
general 2022-06-24 07:58:31 That's not very far
general 2022-06-24 07:58:45 1km walk is like 10 minutes or something
general 2022-06-24 07:59:04 No, just 1km isn't far in general

general 2022-06-24 08:02:05 1km still isn't far
general 2022-06-24 08:02:44 And a the length of a distance can be described as far or short
general 2022-06-24 08:03:47 237km isn't comparable to 1km
general 2022-06-24 08:04:22 Which happens to be true*
general 2022-06-24 08:05:27 It would take me about 7 hours to walk from Dover to Calais

general 2022-07-16 16:25:29 And chances are
general 2022-07-16 16:25:44 It's if you are Pulling out of a dive close to the ground

general 2022-07-19 19:38:23 Yeah same. The Japanese are just awful. Everyday I see the Japanese and I think, god, how can they live with themselves? How can you go on living knowing that 700 years ago you would be considered "Japanese". It's strange to me
general 2022-07-19 19:40:07 You wouldn't. no one will. I don't think anyone will ever understand the horror of being Japanese. Not even the Polish during WWII
general 2022-07-19 19:40:31 Being Japanese must be like being Japanese but without being Chinese
general 2022-07-19 19:41:02 It's an estimate based on the stars

general 2022-07-27 07:55:14 The only good thing about the IS-2 is reverse speed and the amount of damage the shell does

general 2022-07-27 07:57:52 And kill them anyway
general 2022-07-27 07:58:49 Maus has 300mm armour and angled so it's understandable
general 2022-07-27 07:59:07 King Tiger is 6.7 so it's just uptiers that it faces them
general 2022-07-27 07:59:14 I'm not even in an uptier
general 2022-07-27 08:00:33 Same but for Tortoise

general 2022-07-27 08:02:14 ±Tier should be 0.7 rather than 1
general 2022-07-27 08:03:02 Happened to me once :(
general 2022-07-27 08:03:10 I got put in a 9.0 match with 7.7s

general 2022-07-27 08:03:37 1938 spitfire at 3.3 fighting 1942 Focke Wulfs lol
general 2022-07-27 08:04:37 Sweden has HEATFS at 5.3
general 2022-07-27 08:04:41 Or is it 5.0?
general 2022-07-27 08:05:40 I unironically like ratel 90
general 2022-07-27 08:06:01 It's alright at 6.0 imo
general 2022-07-27 08:06:14 It's funny because it's so big
general 2022-07-27 08:06:27 everyone thinks Ratel 90 is just an ez target, it's not
general 2022-07-27 08:06:31 most of it is open space
general 2022-07-27 08:06:50 so most people just end up shooting shells through the other side

general 2022-07-28 23:59:58 okay gn
general 2022-07-29 09:41:21 That's the same Ram my dad used since 2012
general 2022-07-29 09:41:23 speed
general 2022-07-29 09:41:46 But I got constant 60fps playing plane crazy on his pc
general 2022-07-29 09:41:58 Because he had a titan
general 2022-07-29 09:42:13 35 dollars for ram is too cheap imo
general 2022-07-29 09:42:21 also you wanna get 16gb minimum really
general 2022-07-29 09:42:22 Georje
general 2022-07-29 09:42:35 Yes
general 2022-07-29 09:42:49 No
general 2022-07-29 09:42:52 Not 2666 in total
general 2022-07-29 09:43:09 It's still 1333MHz
general 2022-07-29 09:43:39 Don't just buy ram based on price
general 2022-07-29 09:43:50 Wait
general 2022-07-29 09:44:01 You can't even buy DDR4 ram anyway
general 2022-07-29 09:44:10 Your motherboard is taking DDR3 right?
general 2022-07-29 09:44:19 DDR4 and DDR3 are keyed differently
general 2022-07-29 09:44:46 On your ram sticks does it say DDR3 on the side
general 2022-07-29 09:48:12 Also
general 2022-07-29 09:48:17 Check what your motherboard is
general 2022-07-29 09:48:25 Because not all ram is compatible
general 2022-07-29 09:49:01 So you would have to go to the motherboard manufacturers website (or to other website  that test this stuff) and see what ram will definitely work with your motherboard
general 2022-07-29 09:49:15 Even now ram is still a nightmare
general 2022-07-29 09:49:30 Find out then because I can't do it for you
general 2022-07-29 09:49:38 Funny story
general 2022-07-29 09:49:44 I got my pc and it works fine
general 2022-07-29 09:49:54 My brother bought the exact same parts
general 2022-07-29 09:50:02 And the ram doesn't work with his
general 2022-07-29 09:50:43 So I used the extra ram on mine but that causes instability. Even editing the timings and all that it wasn't very stable
general 2022-07-29 09:50:52 I didn't get LGBT lights for my ram
general 2022-07-29 09:51:03 Why the hell do my ram sticks need lights
general 2022-07-29 09:54:07 I wouldn't use a game to pick out my pc parta
general 2022-07-29 09:54:09 parts
general 2022-07-29 09:55:04 There isn't really a point for DRR5 ram yet
general 2022-07-29 09:55:11 Games haven't caught up
general 2022-07-29 09:56:32 Nah they should get it themselves
general 2022-07-29 09:56:53 You're stupid
general 2022-07-29 09:57:01 Why would you do that
general 2022-07-29 09:57:10 You know you can really damage your PC doing that
general 2022-07-29 09:57:18 Fr
general 2022-07-29 09:57:40 Kids these days are technologically inept  tf
general 2022-07-29 09:58:02 I've never broken a PC component 😎
general 2022-07-29 09:58:27 Yes and when I was 13 I knew that you turn something off before you insert an electrical component
general 2022-07-29 09:59:12 Yes
general 2022-07-29 09:59:41 Only thing is it's impossible to turn some outlets off because other things are being powered. like through an extension cable
general 2022-07-29 09:59:49 If you look closely
general 2022-07-29 09:59:59 If you plug something into an extension cable you might see a blue flash
general 2022-07-29 10:00:16 Everyone has a breaker
general 2022-07-29 10:00:22 That is standard safety
general 2022-07-29 10:00:38 And I'm not talking about physically impossible to turn it off
general 2022-07-29 10:00:40 I mean
general 2022-07-29 10:00:41 for example
general 2022-07-29 10:01:13 I have my PC and monitor connected to an extension cable, I can't suddenly turn those off just to plug in my phone charger
general 2022-07-29 10:01:43 It's just better to turn an outlet on once the prongs have a solid connection rather than with air gaps
general 2022-07-29 10:01:50 But it won't damage things not doing so

general 2022-08-15 00:02:01 I've never pulled an all nighter
general 2022-08-15 00:04:18 I knew someone who would say shit like this
general 2022-08-15 00:04:26 It's not usually a good sign
general 2022-08-15 00:04:47 Just the general attention seeking type of messages
general 2022-08-15 00:05:32 They would respond with crap like that too if you brought it up
general 2022-08-15 00:05:44 Just don't be uncool. If you wanna talk to people just talk to people
general 2022-08-15 00:06:28 Doesn't change it

general 2022-08-15 00:24:13 It's the "I'm so lonely without X" or "I wish X was here rn" randomly in chat type of crap
general 2022-08-15 00:24:29 Because I've seen how people act
general 2022-08-15 00:24:53 When did I say it
general 2022-08-15 00:25:45 If I did I would have been banned or if not, warned at the very least
general 2022-08-15 00:25:56 Man if only you knew lol
general 2022-08-15 00:26:04 Dw tho, you'll grow up
general 2022-08-15 00:26:58 The word you are reffering to is filtered
general 2022-08-15 00:27:40 So why don't you report it to the mods then
general 2022-08-15 00:27:55 Instead of complaining at me about it?
general 2022-08-15 00:28:27 He's not. He's 14 and wants a label before he has even finished puberty
general 2022-08-15 00:28:38 Give it a few years it is probably going to change
general 2022-08-15 00:28:41 If not, who cares
general 2022-08-15 00:29:04 Yeah whatever kix

general 2022-08-15 00:29:47 Your balls haven't dropped yet so don't act like you are all wise and know who you are yet
general 2022-08-15 00:29:57 Believe me, you can change a hell of a lot in 1 year

general 2022-08-15 00:35:38 <@720024036863901717> Idk what kind of shit you got exposed to as a kid but I just hope you grow up and actually become yourself when you get older which I'm sure you'll do. You'll most likely disagree with me now but you are still very very young and still subject to a lot of change over the next few years. Don't think you are defined as 1 thing for your whole life
general 2022-08-15 00:36:02 Just read it
general 2022-08-15 00:36:19 What?
general 2022-08-15 00:36:26 No wait wait
general 2022-08-15 00:36:27 He says
general 2022-08-15 00:36:30 Yes yes
general 2022-08-15 00:36:45 Ah my favourite part is
general 2022-08-15 00:36:59 What aint no country I ever heard of. They speak English in what?
general 2022-08-15 00:37:27 Yes he does. Poor reading comprehension skills will do that to someone
general 2022-08-15 00:38:11 The inability to differentiate between sarcasm, jokes, or overall banter from actual hatred is a big problem on the internet now
general 2022-08-15 00:39:38 Also <@720024036863901717> I would just like to correct you on this with reference to this
general 2022-08-15 00:40:31 So you want people to call you different stuff whether they are close friends or not?
general 2022-08-15 00:40:35 That seems rather silly
general 2022-08-15 00:40:42 Hi mel
general 2022-08-15 00:41:28 The guy isn't even past 8th grade yet I'm pretty sure
general 2022-08-15 00:44:46 Basically, Frank is 14, says I'm homophobic and thinks he knows who he is before he's even finished 9th grade. 

I'm mostly just saying that that is infact not the case as with any young person. You will be incredibly subject to change over 1 year, let alone the next 4 or 5 years when you become 18 or whatever.
general 2022-08-15 00:45:14 I think it's ridiculous to label yourself at such a young age
general 2022-08-15 00:46:02 Oops
general 2022-08-15 00:46:32 At least wait till 16 to say what attractions you have is what I think
general 2022-08-15 00:47:02 But for things like gender identity and transgender stuff I would say definitely wait till 18 before you go round telling people you are this and that
general 2022-08-15 00:47:46 Just stick with the default choices until you are of the correct age <:hmm:957230999132045342>
general 2022-08-15 00:48:11 But how old are you
general 2022-08-15 00:48:33 Well you never know you might not be in a few years
general 2022-08-15 00:48:43 Nothing is guaranteed tho
general 2022-08-15 00:49:54 Will it? What if a sudden world ending event occurs that no one would have known would happen
general 2022-08-15 00:50:06 I'm not saying you're gay bro
general 2022-08-15 00:50:22 I'm just saying you don't know what will happen
general 2022-08-15 00:50:50 When I was 14 I was all like "ew gays i hate gays and insert all other slurs for races" and shit
general 2022-08-15 00:50:56 Now look at me
general 2022-08-15 00:51:55 That's called being a coward. get out there and be based you dumbass
general 2022-08-15 00:52:00 (Don't actually do that)
general 2022-08-15 00:52:27 Nah some people you shouldn't accept
general 2022-08-15 00:52:54 I think the whole neo pronouns shit is wacky and should just be deleted
general 2022-08-15 00:53:26 It's all attention seeking. No one in their right mind says "I'm Zier/Xeri" or some crap like that
general 2022-08-15 00:53:52 It affects the person using them
general 2022-08-15 00:53:55 A lot
general 2022-08-15 00:54:03 It's not good for your mental state to live on a lie
general 2022-08-15 00:54:46 Science isn't a myth at all. But neopronouns aren't science
general 2022-08-15 00:55:07 All that Xer/Xir, Zer/Xira type of crap
general 2022-08-15 00:55:12 The made up genders
general 2022-08-15 00:56:22 A joke doesn't neccesarily mean it doesn't have a meaning behind it
general 2022-08-15 00:57:31 It sounds like just some bullshit stereotype but it's actually quite common
general 2022-08-15 00:58:25 I love my father and I'm glad he has raised me

general 2022-08-15 01:03:33 I'm in the UK equivalent of high school and it never started during August
general 2022-08-15 01:03:36 Always september
general 2022-08-15 01:04:13 UK school is more focused on specific chosen subjects at this age rather than many mandatory subjects like in the US tho

general 2022-08-15 01:04:45 Kevlar isn't heavy
general 2022-08-15 01:05:04 And it's not all concentrated on 1 part of your body
general 2022-08-15 01:05:08 The weight is spread
general 2022-08-15 01:05:47 I have a vest it's about 2 or 3kg
general 2022-08-15 01:06:15 About 85kg
general 2022-08-15 01:06:37 Just do Lb / 2.2046 to get KG
the-dump 2022-08-15 01:07:07 True enough because I believe he is in hospital with cancer right now
general 2022-08-15 01:07:42 When you are 12 you tend to be very small
general 2022-08-15 01:08:05 Believe me that weight at 12 years old sounds bad but it isn't
general 2022-08-15 01:08:34 I have pictures of me from when I wad late 11, and I was just under 30kg I was slightly chubby
general 2022-08-15 01:08:47 Depends how tall you are too obviously

general 2022-08-15 01:11:34 OH
general 2022-08-15 01:11:39 My mistake
general 2022-08-15 01:13:35 BMI index doesn't account for muscle mass. It just assumes that the extra mass is fat
general 2022-08-15 01:13:55 Useful for fat people trying to lose weight I guess

general 2022-08-15 01:19:29 It's just full of dumb 13 year olds who are either posting edgy ass shit or 13 year old furries crying in chat because the edgy ones "misgendered" them
general 2022-08-15 01:19:53 Took you 2 minutes to type that out?
general 2022-08-15 01:19:58 And yes that is hot
general 2022-08-15 01:20:13 Especially when you are not used to the weather going above 25 most days
general 2022-08-15 01:20:42 If it is enough to cause drought and fires across the country then it's hot enough

general 2022-08-19 16:27:02 Idk because i don't play plane crazy
general 2022-08-19 23:51:55 Irl this could somewhat happen if you were in a smaller 2 or 3 bladed helicopter and flying past the Vne. It would probably at the top however, instead of doing a swift flip like in the video. But the Hind has 5 blades, can fly 350kmh in level flight so it's Vne is likely to be a lot higher than that.
general 2022-08-19 23:52:33 And the hinds blades rotate the wrong direction for that kind of shit to happen going left
general 2022-08-19 23:53:25 Well maybe you'll learn something :)

general 2022-08-25 09:51:19 Mr Krabs
general 2022-08-25 13:03:45 Wow
general 2022-08-27 15:03:16 Yo do my acc
general 2022-08-27 15:07:38 easier said than done when you have to remove 100 blocks
general 2022-08-27 15:10:07 Let's say you jitter click maybe 10cps, okay so it takes 10 seconds to remove all those blocks, but jitter clicking is unstable so you are likely to pause at times or slow, so accounting for error, 11 seconds. It also means your mouse does not stay on point as well, you may need to adjust a lot so 11.7 seconds. The average build is not just a plane of 100 blocks so you have to change camera angles which means right clicking to change. a pause in deleting means more time taken. 16 seconds
general 2022-08-27 15:10:14 That's a long time to delete parts
general 2022-08-27 15:11:10 That's not even accounting for becoming tired after jitter clicking for a while or the that other people may have different clicking speeds
general 2022-08-27 15:12:38 Wow what have we got here
general 2022-08-27 15:12:53 A degen trying to call another guy  a degen

general 2022-09-07 07:21:33 Ahh  the nelson
general 2022-09-07 07:21:37 I was thinking that
general 2022-09-07 07:21:41 Hi mildis
general 2022-09-07 07:21:54 Mostly because I recognised the way the guns were mounted
general 2022-09-07 07:21:59 3 in a row
general 2022-09-07 07:22:50 i just know pretty much all the battleships were WW1
general 2022-09-07 07:23:01 During WW2
general 2022-09-07 07:23:10 At least with the UK anyway
general 2022-09-07 07:23:27 Damn fat giant slow targets already becoming obsolete
general 2022-09-07 07:23:58 I recognise that it's german
general 2022-09-07 07:24:02 But I don't know what it means
general 2022-09-07 07:25:22 Man
general 2022-09-07 07:25:31 Cant wait for war thunder obama drone strike update
general 2022-09-07 07:25:35 Skink
general 2022-09-07 07:25:46 And also I willshoot down his drones with a spitfire
general 2022-09-07 07:26:35 The spitfire should win easily but if the pilot is stupid then it wont
general 2022-09-07 07:26:49 Oh that's not even war thunder
general 2022-09-07 07:27:02 Depends which
general 2022-09-07 07:27:06 at least in WT
general 2022-09-07 07:27:49 No that's only the Mk 1 , Mk 2 and the LF Mk IX
general 2022-09-07 07:28:32 The LF Mk IX has 14.8 second turn time to
general 2022-09-07 07:28:33 tho
general 2022-09-07 07:28:40 No
general 2022-09-07 07:28:46 the higher br spitfires are griffons
general 2022-09-07 07:28:52 And they don't turn as fast
general 2022-09-07 07:28:55 but my god they are good
general 2022-09-07 07:29:45 Hurricane is not better
general 2022-09-07 07:30:01 It can't energy fight, is slower,  and loses all energy in a single turn anyway
general 2022-09-07 07:30:36 It's easy to use yeah but you gotta learn how to fly the unstable aircraft for the best games
general 2022-09-07 07:31:15 No, the armament isn't shit
general 2022-09-07 07:31:21 But the plane is just slow
general 2022-09-07 07:31:32 Sea Hurricane
general 2022-09-07 07:32:05 I kid you not I saw a guy doing this in sim yesterday
general 2022-09-07 07:32:17 I watched him blow the wings and tail off a heinkel
general 2022-09-07 07:32:22 It was beautiful
general 2022-09-07 07:32:53 No
general 2022-09-07 07:33:03 it just makes the aircraft heavier and slower
general 2022-09-07 07:33:10 Not good for an already slow aircraff
general 2022-09-07 07:33:41 Bruh the Seafire FR 47 💀
general 2022-09-07 07:33:45 It's so slowe
general 2022-09-07 07:33:49 at least stock

general 2022-09-07 07:33:57 cya
general 2022-09-07 07:47:10 because gaijin uptiered mosquito
general 2022-09-07 07:47:46 The main defense of the mosqutio was that it was fast as fuck
general 2022-09-07 07:47:52 so gaijon obviously removes that
general 2022-09-07 07:47:56 same with the Canberras
general 2022-09-07 07:48:12 Hi DRYSPA08

general 2022-09-07 15:38:08 oerlikeron?
general 2022-09-07 15:39:26 Then it would be the Polsten
general 2022-09-07 15:39:54 Polsten was used because it was cheaper and lighter yet still as effective, it's just a misconception that they were oerlikerons
general 2022-09-07 15:40:03 Centurion Mk1 had a polsten
general 2022-09-07 15:40:15 Those SPAA had polstens
general 2022-09-07 15:42:45 Like I said, misconception
general 2022-09-07 15:43:16 Germany however, actually used Oerlikons

general 2022-09-09 07:42:07 Bofors I presume?
general 2022-09-09 07:42:26 Oh
general 2022-09-09 07:42:30 I don't play CTS
general 2022-09-09 07:42:34 Probably a 2pdr
general 2022-09-09 07:43:19 I played it once, changed a default turret on a default hull, left
general 2022-09-09 07:43:31 Didn't even go into a game <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-09 07:44:05 My guy you know being the monarch is hereditary
general 2022-09-09 07:44:11 Can't just run for it
general 2022-09-09 07:44:39 Put 2pdr on abrams
general 2022-09-09 07:45:03 Still more effective than a T-72 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-09-09 07:45:08 Gooood
general 2022-09-09 07:45:30 It smells like bleach in this bus
general 2022-09-09 07:45:37 Or plastic
general 2022-09-09 07:46:11 You know that smell of freshly made plastic out of a wrapper and stuff? little hint of *laundromat* as well in there
general 2022-09-09 07:46:21 Wow
general 2022-09-09 07:47:12 Gotta go
general 2022-09-09 07:47:14 Cya guys
general 2022-09-09 15:34:01 My guy paid for an old account 💀
general 2022-09-09 15:34:29 Yeah
general 2022-09-09 22:33:58 I'm British, can confirm
general 2022-09-09 22:37:40 Uh yeah
general 2022-09-09 22:37:56 Everyone who isn't living under a rock in this server knows I'm British
general 2022-09-09 22:44:47 Goodnight sir
general 2022-09-09 22:46:31 Well because he said supposed
general 2022-09-09 22:46:42 I guess he realises it looks nothing like an F-22
general 2022-09-10 09:47:28 Hard deck rule?
general 2022-09-10 09:47:49 Guy tried to kill the spitfire and he crashed into the ground like a noob
general 2022-09-10 09:48:33 Oh
general 2022-09-10 09:48:38 That rule is shit
general 2022-09-10 09:48:49 I fly 2m above the ground if necessary
general 2022-09-10 09:49:08 Ah
general 2022-09-10 09:49:27 It's very hard to shoot a plane going 500kmh while he's 2m above
general 2022-09-10 09:49:57 Did you try evade the gunfire
general 2022-09-10 09:50:07 For the headon
general 2022-09-10 09:50:16 Why
general 2022-09-10 09:50:34 💀
general 2022-09-10 09:50:58 Yeah but you can turn a lot faster
general 2022-09-10 09:51:07 which is useful for not getting shot
general 2022-09-10 09:51:10 Play chicken
creations-chat 2022-09-10 09:53:43 <@163143541160148992> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1017938789517242398

Why did you blur both the top and the bottom? Now it just looks really small
general 2022-09-10 09:54:42 💀
general 2022-09-10 09:54:56 Yeah, own that 2v1 then
general 2022-09-10 09:55:15 Don't give up and let them kill you like that
general 2022-09-10 09:55:46 You know how detrimental it is to some shitty premium player ego to get killed by a pre war aircraft lol
general 2022-09-10 09:56:37 Those aren't the actual bullet holes that's hust the texture gaijin uses for damaged wing
general 2022-09-10 09:57:19 The more enemies the funner
general 2022-09-10 09:58:49 Bruh bruh bruh
general 2022-09-10 18:52:17 I have an ace in spitfire mk2 or 1
general 2022-09-10 18:53:27 Until the engine overheats
general 2022-09-10 18:53:41 The early spitfires aren't good in extended dogfights
general 2022-09-10 18:53:54 But once you get to the F Mk IX oh your life will change
general 2022-09-10 18:53:58 I love it
general 2022-09-10 18:54:11 It's my favourite spitfire
general 2022-09-10 18:54:37 My only wish is the F Mk IX has the gyro gunsight
general 2022-09-10 18:54:39 Like irl
general 2022-09-10 18:54:57 It had The Reflector gunsight and the MK II Gyro gunsight
general 2022-09-10 18:55:20 Fyi, the MK II Gyro is the one put in the P-51
general 2022-09-10 18:55:39 America added a few more variables to the sight tho
general 2022-09-10 18:56:00 I'm not sure what ones they added but I presume they weren't necessary
general 2022-09-10 18:56:12 Like the Norden Gunsight
general 2022-09-10 19:01:26 The Mk II gyro gunsight for the P-51
general 2022-09-10 19:02:11 Mk II Gyro gunsight for Spitfire
general 2022-09-10 19:03:30 I don't even know how people can fly with mouse aim
general 2022-09-10 19:03:35 Mouse joystick
general 2022-09-10 19:04:48 What tho
general 2022-09-10 19:05:07 I don't see any advantages for it except cheaper than buying a hotas and rudder system
general 2022-09-10 19:05:31 Britain
general 2022-09-10 19:05:44 If you are planning to do air you will love it
general 2022-09-10 19:06:06 If you are planning to do ground, you will hate it because you need a very particular set of skills to play British ground
general 2022-09-10 19:06:20 short britain?
general 2022-09-10 19:06:53 OH Israel
general 2022-09-10 19:07:02 Yeah I wanted to do that but
general 2022-09-10 19:07:04 I decided nah
general 2022-09-10 19:07:10 I have the meteor for Britain now
general 2022-09-10 19:07:14 No
general 2022-09-10 19:07:51 The meteor is actually a beast despite being slower than most jets at that Br
general 2022-09-10 19:08:12 You can turn fight in meteor too
general 2022-09-10 19:08:23 Big downside about the meteor tho is the slow roll rate
general 2022-09-10 19:08:32 It's worse than the Spitfire Mk 1 roll rate
general 2022-09-10 19:08:52 clipped wings do to a degree
general 2022-09-10 19:09:08 but you don't get clipped wings till 8.0
general 2022-09-10 19:09:35 No
general 2022-09-10 19:10:07 Just don't roll scissors any aircraft except Ho229 or something
general 2022-09-10 19:10:30 But the meteors do have a high turn rate
general 2022-09-10 19:10:43 So, rolling scissors can be somewhat done
general 2022-09-10 19:11:22 Go for F4U-4
general 2022-09-10 19:11:32 Then go F4U 4B
general 2022-09-10 19:11:39 Nah
general 2022-09-10 19:11:44 Icba to do the challenges
general 2022-09-10 19:12:23 Hang on
general 2022-09-10 19:12:33 F8F 1B is 6.3 for USA but 6.7 for France
general 2022-09-10 19:12:42 I gotta compare the differences if there are any
general 2022-09-10 19:13:04 BRUH
general 2022-09-10 19:13:09 They are literally the same
general 2022-09-10 19:13:24 Except france costs way more and is higher BR
general 2022-09-10 19:13:26 pfft
general 2022-09-10 19:13:41 American players are so shit that they need a lower br for the same aircraft
general 2022-09-10 19:13:53 And cheaper repair
general 2022-09-10 19:15:26 They are so good
general 2022-09-10 19:15:36 For the Griffon Spitfires
general 2022-09-10 19:15:46 Get the F MK XIVe obviously
general 2022-09-10 19:16:59 You will have to buy the XVIIIe to get the Mk 22 but don't crew it. Just crew the Mk 22. 
Then get the Mk 24 for higher top speed and climb rate compared to the Mk 22. 

Rn I'm researching the Mk 22.
general 2022-09-10 19:17:01 Also advice
general 2022-09-10 19:17:56 Don't get the Seafire FR 47, it's heavier, can't turn as well, climb and slower stock. So unless you want to suffer before it's upgraded then don't
general 2022-09-10 19:17:59 Only plus side is
general 2022-09-10 19:18:05 It has takeoff flaps
general 2022-09-10 19:18:44 Oh and it has 4x Hispano Mk V
general 2022-09-10 19:19:38 Both Griffon Seafires have Mk V hispanos, the Lf Mk 3 doesn't
general 2022-09-10 19:19:59 And none have gyro gunsighrs
general 2022-09-10 19:20:58 FR 47 does look cool as hell tho
general 2022-09-10 19:21:05 Also big radiators, it barely overheats
general 2022-09-10 19:21:22 <@883063424614006878> Sup
general 2022-09-10 19:21:32 You give it to me
general 2022-09-10 19:21:57 Yiu wanna see my crew man
general 2022-09-10 19:25:45 I just lost 8.8k for my seafire which only has 3 modifications
general 2022-09-10 19:25:52 I didn't even get up to 1k altitude
general 2022-09-10 19:25:56 Slow ass plane
general 2022-09-10 19:25:59 But I want to spade it

general 2022-09-12 15:30:45 Also hi furry
general 2022-09-12 15:30:49 :)
general 2022-09-12 15:43:59 77mm HV was called that because the shell casing was slightly shorter compared to the 17pdr, so despite being the same calibre, they still had differentiate between the shells
general 2022-09-12 15:44:35 Nothing more fun than loading your short shell into a full length 17pdr breach and watch the casing just fucking expand and get stuck
general 2022-09-12 15:44:55 Or alternatively
general 2022-09-12 15:45:11 trying to load a full length 17pdr shell into a 77mmHV and it not fitting

general 2022-09-13 22:45:36 then point the turret up and destroy him from below

general 2022-09-17 12:35:36 330 million people in the US, not all 330 million are racist

general 2022-09-17 12:41:58 Being chubby 100 years ago just meant you weren't poor

general 2022-09-17 15:06:36 All the 2pdrs have APHE, including the British ones
general 2022-09-17 15:07:05 Fair
general 2022-09-17 15:07:20 The bri'ish ones that don't have APHE are 6pdr ones
general 2022-09-17 15:08:38 I've had the exact opposite experience lol
general 2022-09-17 15:08:47 Always dominating Panzer 4s with the 6pdr
general 2022-09-17 15:08:55 The long 6pdr is even better
general 2022-09-17 15:09:12 One on the Churchill 3 and AEC Mk II

general 2022-09-17 15:16:14 I only added did 4 things as well

general 2022-09-17 15:18:19 They put 2 40mm guns on a Hurricane and it still turns 16.7 seconds stock
general 2022-09-17 15:18:34 And it is FULL of armour

general 2022-09-17 19:34:38 I don't bother with wagers unless I'm in a squad really
general 2022-09-17 19:34:41 Especially air rb tho
general 2022-09-17 19:35:10 Getting more than 3 kills in air rb is not a common occurance for most people, including me
general 2022-09-17 19:35:51 Ahout 2 werks ago however, I did manage a 6 kill game with the Spitfire Mk 1
general 2022-09-17 19:36:00 I said getting more than 3 kills
general 2022-09-17 19:36:23 How many 4 kill games do most people have
general 2022-09-17 19:36:26 Not very many
general 2022-09-17 19:36:30 For air Rb
general 2022-09-17 19:37:27 Bad idea
general 2022-09-17 19:38:21 I doubt that
general 2022-09-17 19:39:00 I already know this
general 2022-09-17 19:39:26 It's also useful for those fun times when both of you are going up and you need the other guy to stall first
general 2022-09-17 19:39:34 Spitfire +landing flaps very cool
general 2022-09-17 19:41:28 The Griffon seafires get Hispano Mk V tho
general 2022-09-17 19:41:35 Seafire FR 47 is good but not as a turnfightwr
general 2022-09-17 19:41:38 Only boom and zoom
general 2022-09-17 19:41:53 that shit can DIVE. Super fast dive accel and the wing rip is 890kmh
general 2022-09-17 19:42:01 Yeah
general 2022-09-17 19:42:04 755kmh top speed

general 2022-09-17 20:04:51 No nametags
general 2022-09-17 20:05:14 It's to flex our skill snd cope when we die, not arcade
general 2022-09-17 20:05:30 Okay

general 2022-09-17 20:59:11 Get dominated <@315262125113081856>
general 2022-09-17 20:59:51 This was Spitfire vs 109
general 2022-09-17 21:00:02 for anyone wondering
general 2022-09-17 21:00:54 I gotta say tho <@315262125113081856> You are a good pilot and you know how to fight a spirfire. You just can't fight me 😎
general 2022-09-17 21:02:46 Believe me, a good aircraft is nothing in the hands of an incapable pilot
general 2022-09-17 21:03:11 Yes in war thunder
general 2022-09-17 21:03:52 You should have seen us
general 2022-09-17 21:04:02 we were pretty much in a stalemate for most of the game
general 2022-09-17 21:04:29 Yeah that was when I actually got close to him
general 2022-09-17 21:04:47 He was smart and boom and zoomed
general 2022-09-17 21:04:58 Only thing is I know how to evade fire so it wasn't working
general 2022-09-17 21:05:17 so slowly, I could climb up while retaining enough energy to move out of the way if need be
general 2022-09-17 21:05:47 F Mk IX and I don't know which 109 he was in
general 2022-09-17 21:06:19 Either an F4 or G6
general 2022-09-17 21:06:35 BRO I COULD SEE THAT FUCKING LAG
general 2022-09-17 21:06:43 I was like tf goin on with his plane
general 2022-09-17 21:06:58 Yeah yeah yeah
general 2022-09-17 21:07:16 What about when both of us used I15
general 2022-09-17 21:07:26 I killed him twice in 5 minutes then he left to play with his friend
general 2022-09-17 21:07:34 Excuses <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-17 21:07:40 I do
general 2022-09-17 21:08:08 Yeah yeah you are just mad I dominated you <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-17 21:08:19 Also what 109 was kt
general 2022-09-17 21:08:22 it
general 2022-09-17 21:08:36 Ah
general 2022-09-17 21:08:51 I didn't check
general 2022-09-17 21:10:25 15 minute dogfight and he blames it on spitfire when he loses 🤓
general 2022-09-17 21:10:49 I don't main Britain
general 2022-09-17 21:11:08 I like French air too
general 2022-09-17 21:11:31 German aircraft are good too but crew being inexperienced is a demotivator for taking it to sim
general 2022-09-17 21:11:38 Who said that?
general 2022-09-17 21:13:05 If I have no games in them how would I have french planes
general 2022-09-17 21:13:20 I don't even touch naval
general 2022-09-17 21:13:27 I'm broke
general 2022-09-17 21:14:34 What?
general 2022-09-17 21:16:00 I don't get jt
general 2022-09-17 21:16:29 Ih
general 2022-09-17 21:16:30 Oh
general 2022-09-17 21:28:39 Tommorow
general 2022-09-17 23:19:27 Yak 1B pretty cool
general 2022-09-17 23:19:43 I didn't have time to play sim battle so I just took it into air rb
general 2022-09-17 23:20:04 But as you can imagine, flying with full real controls puts me at a disadvantage to mouse aim
general 2022-09-17 23:20:24 Didn't stop me wasting 5 minutes of the enemies time trying to kill me anyway
general 2022-09-17 23:20:34 I tell you, these guys have shit aim
general 2022-09-17 23:21:04 Also turns out that the Yak 1B can do the funny trick I learned a few months ago
general 2022-09-17 23:21:18 Like, going from 400kmh to 150kmh in 1 second trick 😎
general 2022-09-17 23:22:18 I wanted to use it in the air rb battles but as usual, these idiots always rush into the middle at 100m altitude and fight it out like they are 1300s english peasants
general 2022-09-17 23:22:39 So tommorow I'll use it in sim. At least air battles usually start at 2000 or 1000m high there
general 2022-09-17 23:23:01 Usually ending at 100m tho 💀
general 2022-09-17 23:23:22 Anyway that's all. Cya

general 2022-09-18 17:54:47 He begged me to duel for 4 months, then blamed it on my plane being better because I went 9-2 on him
general 2022-09-18 17:55:32 "Ur plane better" Okay mf. We were in a deadlock for 15 minutes and I still killed him at the end
general 2022-09-18 17:55:41 Guy failed at boom and zoom 💀
general 2022-09-18 17:56:37 He got a lucky shot on me and damaged my radiator early game. I killed him 3 times between then and him killing me
general 2022-09-18 17:56:58 which was mostly because the engine overheated (no oil and water) so I could do jack shit
general 2022-09-18 17:57:08 If it was a proper match I could fly back to AF and repair
general 2022-09-18 17:57:21 Yeah I won
general 2022-09-18 17:57:28 Killed him 9 times
general 2022-09-18 17:57:31 He killed me twice
general 2022-09-18 17:57:37 Ik
general 2022-09-18 17:57:41 😎
general 2022-09-18 17:58:13 I even didn't shoot him down when he flatspinned (this occurred 4 times)
general 2022-09-18 17:58:40 Bf109 is really good if you can use it correctly
general 2022-09-18 17:58:45 and don't get me wrong
general 2022-09-18 17:58:46 he was
general 2022-09-18 17:59:09 He was boom and zooming and was higher in alt than me most the game
general 2022-09-18 17:59:17 But I still win
general 2022-09-18 17:59:28 Cope
general 2022-09-18 17:59:48 It was a custom match so no replay I think
general 2022-09-18 17:59:56 What is extending?
general 2022-09-18 18:00:15 I can literally just boom and zoom you
general 2022-09-18 18:00:32 I don't need to turnfight opponents I know I can't turnfight
general 2022-09-18 18:01:19 My guy I took the same aircraft out and still beat you
general 2022-09-18 18:01:27 i15 vs i15 and I killed you twice
general 2022-09-18 18:01:38 Green looks nice
general 2022-09-18 18:01:48 Yeah yeah sure
general 2022-09-18 18:01:53 Just mad I killed you <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 18:01:57 Shit was goofy tho
general 2022-09-18 18:02:12 I have P63 if that works
general 2022-09-18 18:03:25 I like those P39 or P63 type aircraft simply because I can see the runway during takeoff
general 2022-09-18 18:03:56 Yeah
general 2022-09-18 18:04:03 Crab the plane in
general 2022-09-18 18:05:00 <@315262125113081856> Do you even deflection shoot bro? <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 18:05:11 Wrong
general 2022-09-18 18:05:34 While I was going 150kmh and the other was when I was in a straight line
general 2022-09-18 18:05:40 That aint deflection shooting
general 2022-09-18 18:06:17 Wrong
general 2022-09-18 18:06:49 Go Yak line
general 2022-09-18 18:07:11 Yes
general 2022-09-18 18:07:41 It annoys me Yak 1 has all trim but Yak 1B only has elevator trim
general 2022-09-18 18:08:04 Trim is important
general 2022-09-18 18:08:20 What?
general 2022-09-18 18:08:41 Trim is so you can make your aircraft fly in a straight line
general 2022-09-18 18:08:48 Or help to do so
general 2022-09-18 18:09:04 Elevator trim is bare minimum
general 2022-09-18 18:09:13 but elevator and rudder trim are preferred
general 2022-09-18 18:10:16 <@315262125113081856> do you have any french planes
general 2022-09-18 18:11:32 It's 3.0
general 2022-09-18 18:11:54 It's 3.0 I literally have it up right now
general 2022-09-18 18:12:11 All br it is 3.0
general 2022-09-18 18:12:17 All battle mode I mean
general 2022-09-18 18:12:49 3.0
general 2022-09-18 18:12:55 and I'm not activating windows
general 2022-09-18 18:13:11 I was too lazy to send the screenshot from my main to this acc
general 2022-09-18 18:13:31 💀 IT IS 2.3
general 2022-09-18 18:13:32 WRF
general 2022-09-18 18:15:01 Alright I'm gonna do a sim game
general 2022-09-18 18:15:02 bye
general 2022-09-18 21:13:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES0jJe5be_8
general 2022-09-18 21:13:29 Spitfire Mk 2 turn 15.1, Yak 1B turn 18.5,

Spitfire F MK IX turn, 17.2, BF 109 F4 19.0 Turn

That is a difference of 3 seconds (give or take) for both aircraft. Now who was it that said I only dominated him because I was in a Spitfire? 🤔
general 2022-09-18 21:13:33 <@315262125113081856>
general 2022-09-18 21:15:06 He's the best, after me 😎
general 2022-09-18 21:30:12 Oh really? Then why did I kill you 9 times <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 21:44:07 So now you want to P36 duel?
general 2022-09-18 21:44:28 That tends to happen on things when you are learning
general 2022-09-18 21:45:00 The kills I'm getting hasn't caught up to my noob day deaths
general 2022-09-18 21:45:33 No
general 2022-09-18 21:45:37 I'm eating dinner
general 2022-09-18 21:45:43 and I already played a sim game today
general 2022-09-18 21:45:48 went 9-0 in the Yak 1B
general 2022-09-18 21:46:10 Shame I forgot to activate boosters beforehand
general 2022-09-18 21:46:45 And you'd probably be fucked <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 21:47:40 Okay and? I kill dudes at 8.0 with a Mk 1 Spitfire
general 2022-09-18 21:47:43 that's 7.7s mate
general 2022-09-18 21:47:47 Not even 50 cals
general 2022-09-18 21:48:20 If I can do that with 7.7s then fear me when I have cannons
general 2022-09-18 21:48:28 Already have 😎
general 2022-09-18 21:48:53 Trust me so do 7.7 tracers
general 2022-09-18 21:49:00 Long range lighters I call then
general 2022-09-18 21:49:37 Yeah, me in my i15 consistantly killing your i15
general 2022-09-18 21:50:01 Oh really? Why did you rage quit after I killed you twice in 2 minutes then
general 2022-09-18 21:50:12 Lies
general 2022-09-18 21:50:46 I already fought you and you malded after I beat you
general 2022-09-18 21:50:52 No lol
general 2022-09-18 21:50:57 You're scared
general 2022-09-18 21:51:19 That's why you want a rematch, because me dominating you hurt your ego <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 21:51:42 You didn't even invite
general 2022-09-18 21:51:52 and I'm not on vr rn
general 2022-09-18 21:52:10 Now you invited
general 2022-09-18 21:52:24 You didn't
general 2022-09-18 21:52:29 Not
general 2022-09-18 21:52:47 But that doesn't mean I declined either even if I had recieved
general 2022-09-18 21:53:01 Anyway no, I only opened the game to check the match results from earlier
general 2022-09-18 21:53:23 I got a 130 kill worth skin in 1 game
general 2022-09-18 21:54:12 I didn't but it was sim so it multiplies
general 2022-09-18 21:54:37 He thinks I'm on vr still
general 2022-09-18 21:54:58 That would be unhygienic ew
general 2022-09-18 21:55:17 Anyway
general 2022-09-18 21:55:28 time to buy Yak 7, Yak 9 and 9B all in one go

general 2022-09-18 21:58:21 Fair
general 2022-09-18 21:58:31 I want the 9T and Yak 3
general 2022-09-18 21:59:45 I hate the dumbass commie that decided to paint the Yak 3P all red
general 2022-09-18 21:59:53 It looks cool but that is not very good camo
general 2022-09-18 22:00:14 To a degree
general 2022-09-18 22:03:36 Who lost what?

general 2022-09-18 22:06:09 <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-09-18 22:06:19 If no then why did you lose?
general 2022-09-18 22:06:30 Should have thought about not losing before you tried playing against me
general 2022-09-18 22:07:08 Yeah I have peripheral vision so what? You could too if you used your eyes
general 2022-09-18 22:07:26 "Turn on smoke because I can't see you"
general 2022-09-18 22:08:01 Ok and? The screen isn't focused 1 inch away
general 2022-09-18 22:08:18 Your aircraft being 1km away, I still have to focus my eyes for 1km distance
general 2022-09-18 22:08:36 Mad you got defeated
general 2022-09-18 22:08:45 🧂
general 2022-09-18 22:09:08 I used to
general 2022-09-18 22:09:16 <:confident:973332698586296360>
general 2022-09-18 22:09:32 Why should I purposely have a skill issue?
general 2022-09-18 22:09:40 Should have thought before you spoke
general 2022-09-18 22:09:58 If I'm skill issue then why are you skill issuing?
general 2022-09-18 22:10:31 Scared to fight? You begged me to fight for 4 months and cried when I killed you 2 games in a row
general 2022-09-18 22:10:40 I have no reason to be scared
general 2022-09-18 22:10:56 Waiting for a valid argument <:ok:973724551353622578>
general 2022-09-18 22:11:10 9-2 baby
general 2022-09-18 22:11:12 I don't lose
general 2022-09-18 22:11:45 That wasn't losing. That was me simply letting him kill me so he wouldn't feel bad
general 2022-09-18 22:12:04 Yeah I'm not sticking my headset back on
general 2022-09-18 22:12:16 You should have asked for a fight when I was in Vr
general 2022-09-18 22:12:26 None of my things are plugged in either
general 2022-09-18 22:12:38 When
general 2022-09-18 22:12:57 No, you can't really see behind you that well like that
general 2022-09-18 22:13:11 Oh
general 2022-09-18 22:13:45 You can but it's awkward. When I'm playing rb I just use C+mouse drag
general 2022-09-18 22:14:26 <@723601991858782218>

general 2022-09-18 22:16:47 Did you know some aircraft don't even have wings attached
general 2022-09-18 22:16:59 The first person model like half the wings are missing on some planes

general 2022-09-18 22:39:30 As a dogfighter no
general 2022-09-18 22:39:41 it was never intended to be a dogfigher either
general 2022-09-18 22:40:01 700 flares / chaffs is cool
general 2022-09-18 22:40:10 For the Gr7
general 2022-09-18 22:40:21 I don't get why the gr 7 is 11.0 tho
general 2022-09-18 22:40:32 And god knows how the Gr 1 is even 10.0
general 2022-09-18 22:41:16 Gaijin the only company that will say "Let's make the wright flyer 11.3 because too many users are getting kills with it"

general 2022-09-18 22:59:48 but at that point your arms will atart to be going bigger

general 2022-09-20 15:38:50 Yk what I find interesting
general 2022-09-20 15:38:58 The variety of weapons used by the armed police here
general 2022-09-20 15:39:08 I never really see 2 officers carrying the same weapon
general 2022-09-20 15:39:44 Love the armed police tho. Mega respect for them
general 2022-09-20 15:41:39 Usually outside a specific post they have the same weapons tho
general 2022-09-20 15:41:57 When they are walking about
general 2022-09-20 23:49:34 I fucking hate the new discord video player

general 2022-09-20 23:53:43 It's not
general 2022-09-20 23:53:52 I already joined that server by accident before anyway
general 2022-09-20 23:54:07 just typing random shit into the invite link brought me there
general 2022-09-20 23:54:50 They ported Ios to android
general 2022-09-20 23:54:53 because they got lazy
general 2022-09-20 23:55:02 but it's fucking dogshit and doesn't work
general 2022-09-20 23:56:10 Of course Discord don't give a shit
general 2022-09-20 23:56:23 them and their fake ass apologises to users on the google store
general 2022-09-20 23:56:45 "We're so sorry that our shitass update didn't work. Did you try reinstall?" Like fuck off

general 2022-09-21 15:52:31 I have an I5 12400
general 2022-09-21 15:52:53 It's very good
general 2022-09-21 15:53:12 Probably won't be
general 2022-09-21 15:53:24 A good CPU is important for gaming as well

general 2022-09-21 15:55:18 A gpu freezing won't crash the PC
general 2022-09-21 15:55:24 You just won't have a display
general 2022-09-21 15:57:11 Everytime it crashes??
general 2022-09-21 15:57:28 Bruh
general 2022-09-21 15:58:21 <@495210490172014612> Check the ram capatability very carefullu
general 2022-09-21 15:58:33 Some ram sticks don't work with some motherboards
general 2022-09-21 15:58:44 And it can fuck shit up
general 2022-09-21 15:59:09 Not cap
general 2022-09-21 15:59:11 Look it up
general 2022-09-21 15:59:20 Anyway,  getting off bus
general 2022-09-21 15:59:24 Afk
general 2022-09-21 16:28:38 It should work if it has enough voltage and is kept cool
general 2022-09-21 16:32:31 To be fair, a Tiger 2 should be perfectly capable of taking out a BMP. If you can't do that you really are just shit
general 2022-09-21 16:32:47 Idiots think that the Tiger 2 needs to be at a BR where nothing can pen it
general 2022-09-21 16:32:58 Not if you are good
general 2022-09-21 16:34:20 Tiger 2 is a fucking armoured beast. It's not some shitty car that is slapped at 6.7 for why not
general 2022-09-21 16:34:55 In all my time playing war thunder
general 2022-09-21 16:35:10 I rarely see Tiger 2s get buttfucked by ATGM
general 2022-09-21 16:35:19 Boohoo your armour can be penned
general 2022-09-21 16:35:44 People over exagerate the amount of vehicles with heat at 6.7
general 2022-09-21 16:36:22 I know it's 6.7
general 2022-09-21 16:36:57 How about we move Tiger 1 down to 1.3 because Archer can pen it with 17pdr like butter
general 2022-09-21 16:37:08 6.7 doesn't meet 8.0
general 2022-09-21 16:37:33 Bro
general 2022-09-21 16:37:39 6.7 can't be uptiered to 8.p
general 2022-09-21 16:37:52 That's a 1.3 Br increase the game doesn't do that
general 2022-09-21 16:37:55 except for bugs
general 2022-09-21 16:38:35 It should be ± 0.7 for br
general 2022-09-21 16:39:03 At 8.0 to 7.0 it is scary even APDS can barely pen it
general 2022-09-21 16:39:10 At 9.0 it's gonna get peepee poopoood on
general 2022-09-21 16:39:50 The L7 105mm is one of the best guns at that br and it can barely pen the maus frontally
general 2022-09-21 16:40:09 Maus downtiered to 6.0? No way
general 2022-09-21 16:41:13 No german weapons have 300mm pen at 6.0
general 2022-09-21 16:42:11 I have heatfs at 6.0
general 2022-09-21 16:42:14 ratel 90
general 2022-09-21 16:42:20 That thing is good if you play it correctly
general 2022-09-21 16:42:26 otherwise it's just a fat slow bus
general 2022-09-21 16:42:42 I want the 20
general 2022-09-21 16:42:56 No
general 2022-09-21 16:43:05 I don't even remember what that is
general 2022-09-21 16:43:23 What what
general 2022-09-21 16:43:36 What when was that added
general 2022-09-21 16:43:47 Premium I presume?
general 2022-09-21 16:45:21 I never knew what that did as a kid
general 2022-09-21 16:45:31 Since I only played ground a few times when I was younger
general 2022-09-21 16:45:36 And just played arcade
general 2022-09-21 16:45:47 I saw the word realistic and thought it would be hard
general 2022-09-21 16:46:17 You need strat too
general 2022-09-21 16:46:27 I play sim
general 2022-09-21 16:46:36 Idgaf about sim with tanks tho
general 2022-09-21 16:46:44 i just use the aircraft
general 2022-09-21 16:47:15 British ground in sim would be very good
general 2022-09-21 16:47:39 Use the milirads on your sight
general 2022-09-21 16:47:54 WDYM LOW VELOCITY
general 2022-09-21 16:48:12 Which br we talking about
general 2022-09-21 16:48:27 My guy
general 2022-09-21 16:48:39 Britain has some of the highest mv guns at that Br
general 2022-09-21 16:48:51 Fireflies are 4.7
general 2022-09-21 16:49:03 Even so
general 2022-09-21 16:49:13 the 17pdr is like 850ms mv
general 2022-09-21 16:49:21 And with APDS it's over 1000
general 2022-09-21 16:49:44 Nah
general 2022-09-21 16:49:52 Love APDs
general 2022-09-21 16:50:00 love ruining a Panthers day
general 2022-09-21 16:50:40 You haven't played against me then <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-09-21 16:50:47 I have mastered this shit
general 2022-09-21 16:51:01 It's so easy to 1 shot a Panther with APDS
general 2022-09-21 16:51:13 You just shoot ever so slightly right of the centre
general 2022-09-21 16:51:31 That way the driver dies, the entire turret crew dies and if lucky the hull gunner does
general 2022-09-21 16:51:36 It does
general 2022-09-21 16:51:46 Not rare
general 2022-09-21 16:51:55 I delete the ammo of most of my victims
general 2022-09-21 16:52:09 If I'm not spawling their crew to death anyway
general 2022-09-21 16:52:19 Bug
general 2022-09-21 16:52:54 That's because they use APHE so the explosive sets it off
general 2022-09-21 16:53:24 Don't even get me started on 17pdr Shot Mk 8
general 2022-09-21 16:53:34 That thing is scary
general 2022-09-21 16:56:23 I usually bring a Spitfire
general 2022-09-21 16:56:28 I leave the ground alone
general 2022-09-21 16:56:31 And I kill the aircraft

general 2022-09-24 23:24:57 Yak 141?
general 2022-09-24 23:25:17 Looks pretty good
general 2022-09-24 23:28:21 Yes because the Queen is the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth
general 2022-09-24 23:28:26 not just England
general 2022-09-24 23:28:36 But now we have a King
general 2022-09-24 23:28:51 It still feels weird saying King Charles the 3rd
general 2022-09-24 23:29:29 Well there have only been 2 other Charles as king here
general 2022-09-24 23:30:11 At least it's not Henry the 9th
general 2022-09-24 23:30:27 John the 2nd
general 2022-09-24 23:30:46 King John is the reason we have rights
general 2022-09-24 23:30:59 not because King John advocated for peasants rights
general 2022-09-24 23:31:21 but because he was so fucking evil that people rebelled and made him sign the magna carter
general 2022-09-24 23:31:25 Yes
general 2022-09-24 23:31:40 The eye of France
general 2022-09-24 23:32:40 Fuck up? My guy, I get so many advantages just for being British
general 2022-09-24 23:32:44 One of them is human rights
general 2022-09-24 23:33:28 Why is this shit in bold now?
general 2022-09-24 23:33:36 Best military?
general 2022-09-24 23:33:49 700 billion dollar budget and you guys put out fuck all in military inovations
general 2022-09-24 23:34:17 But what makes it best?
general 2022-09-24 23:34:36 We talking technological advantages? Logistics? What?
general 2022-09-24 23:35:07 Nuclear carriers aren't necessarily an advantage
general 2022-09-24 23:36:00 I know. You just said that 2 seconds agl
general 2022-09-24 23:36:01 ago
general 2022-09-24 23:36:14 But nuclear still isn't necessarily an advantage
general 2022-09-24 23:36:24 In some situations yes, in a lot of situations no
general 2022-09-24 23:37:02 Still limited by food and fresh water supply, also fuel for onboard vehicles
general 2022-09-24 23:38:19 Less cost? My guy you know how expensive nuclear reactors are to operate. I never said a nuclear disaster will happen either. That's very unlikely today, especially in the west
general 2022-09-24 23:39:23 Unless the reactor is struck
general 2022-09-24 23:39:29 Which is a serious issue imo
general 2022-09-24 23:39:55 Nuclear reactors are good on land where they can be heavily shielded
general 2022-09-24 23:40:32 I don't think you understand how nuclear reactors work if you think they are safe if they are hit with explosives
general 2022-09-24 23:41:26 I'm not even talking about my navy I'm just talking about nuclear vs diesel carriers
general 2022-09-24 23:41:35 And he is malding and making it personal

general 2022-09-24 23:48:47 Germany was already losing by the time you guys joined WW1, we had air superiority before you joined WW2
general 2022-09-24 23:49:00 Yes and yes actually
general 2022-09-24 23:49:50 Highly disproven but okay
general 2022-09-24 23:50:18 To be fair, they fucked a lot of shit up for everyone else
general 2022-09-24 23:50:23 they don't go down without a fight
general 2022-09-24 23:50:38 Imagine 20 million soviets dying on the way to Berlin 💀
general 2022-09-24 23:51:10 If you believe that then why are you so desperate to argue with me

general 2022-09-25 00:21:22 Are you sure you aren't talking about wipes <@531650600295727115>
general 2022-09-25 00:21:26 Toilet paper is flushable
general 2022-09-25 00:21:33 that's why it's called toilet paper
general 2022-09-25 00:21:46 Wipes are not flushable tho

general 2022-09-25 21:46:23 Oh dissolve rust
general 2022-09-25 21:46:38 Well that's not necessarily getting rid of rust unless you remove the liquid after
general 2022-09-25 21:46:51 So it's probably not dissolving the rust
general 2022-09-25 21:46:56 and instead just breaking it doqn

general 2022-09-25 22:29:34 I seem to always be the only fucking aircraft on my team
general 2022-09-25 22:29:38 against 5 enemy aircraft

general 2022-09-25 22:33:08 I don't even understand why people use the premium i-153 when you can just take the normal i-15 and have like 7 second turntime instead of 13
general 2022-09-25 22:33:58 Anyway, gn

general 2022-09-28 14:54:57 Bullpups are better imo
general 2022-09-28 14:55:13 I think the advantages that come with it outweigh the .03 seconds longer it takes to reload
general 2022-09-28 14:55:38 But it all depends on what you prefer so
general 2022-09-28 14:55:42 Not such a big deal
general 2022-09-28 14:55:52 Compared to what?

general 2022-09-28 15:00:06 You can just replace the front handgrip
general 2022-09-28 15:00:26 you don't need to extend the reciever. that also makes the gas rod very long which increased weight
general 2022-09-28 15:00:50 so you either need to add more gas with a) bigger gas tap or b) move the gas block backwards

general 2022-09-30 22:50:50 I'm not American
general 2022-09-30 22:51:01 Alegbra 1 doesn't tell me what type of Algebra it is
general 2022-09-30 22:51:25 I'm guessing it's shit like Completing the squars, circle equations?
general 2022-09-30 22:51:39 What
general 2022-09-30 22:51:42 What it is then?
general 2022-09-30 22:51:54 Oh
general 2022-09-30 22:51:58 That's it*
general 2022-09-30 22:52:00 ?
general 2022-09-30 22:52:50 Ahh
general 2022-09-30 22:52:54 I got a good question for you
general 2022-09-30 22:54:30 Joe mama has a draw containing 11 dollars and 25 cents composed of 173 coins. All of which are nickels (5 cents) and quarters (25 cents)

How many quarters and nickels are there respectively?
general 2022-09-30 22:55:53 It doesn't
general 2022-09-30 22:56:16 Okay
general 2022-09-30 23:10:00 Well, A+B = 173

A(0.25) + B(0.05) = 11.25

Let 0.05= x

A = Quarter B = Nickel

A(5x) + B(x) 

173-B(5x) + B(x)

865x-5Bx + Bx = 11.25

865x - 4Bx = 11.25

865(0.05) - 0.2B = 11.25

43.25 - 0.2B = 11.25
11.25 - 43.25 / 0.2 = -B = -160
Therefore B = 160

A = 173-160 
so A = 13

13(0.25) + 160(0.05) = 11.25
general 2022-09-30 23:10:20 Apologises took a while. On mobile it makes it a little harder to type out

general 2022-10-03 15:47:41 Climb rate isn't just a number
general 2022-10-03 15:47:43 for example
general 2022-10-03 15:48:09 the seafire FR 47 climbrate is about 26ms but it is very slow and heavy so it is pretty much deleted
general 2022-10-03 15:48:22 The only way to climb in an FR 47 is to zoom climb

general 2022-10-03 15:54:28 You are thinking of the S-199
general 2022-10-03 15:54:36 Which is actually a czechoslovakian aircraft

general 2022-10-03 15:55:01 Only czechoslovakian machine guns
general 2022-10-03 15:55:38 It's the synchroniser mechanism that the czechoslovakians made for it

general 2022-10-05 15:54:47 Are you sure it isn't talking about the angle of the wings perpendicular to the body?
general 2022-10-05 15:55:04 As in, the wings are swept 157° compared to the tailing edge, or as you would say swept 23°
general 2022-10-05 15:56:01 So it turns out Internet Explorer came back to life
general 2022-10-05 15:57:07 Actually I checked on google
general 2022-10-05 15:57:10 The sweep of the F14 is 35° at max, in the image his is at max so 23° can't be the wing sweep
general 2022-10-05 15:58:16 Hi
general 2022-10-05 15:58:48 What
general 2022-10-05 15:59:19 No

general 2022-10-05 16:02:34 If you think the Periodic table looks complex never do chemistry
general 2022-10-05 16:02:58 I don't mean you specifically

general 2022-10-05 16:04:03 I don't like writing 5 different numbers around a compound to show information

general 2022-10-05 16:04:52 2 Mg²+ (s) shit <:nooo:973333057878777947>
general 2022-10-05 16:05:10 I am definitely not doing chemistry for university
general 2022-10-05 16:05:58 I don't want to Heisenberg I want to Oppenheimer
general 2022-10-05 16:06:08 I want to study nuclear physics
general 2022-10-05 16:06:48 Easier than chem imo
general 2022-10-05 16:07:18 Well I'm doing the same exam board for both subjects
general 2022-10-05 16:07:32 Physics isn't just math

general 2022-10-05 22:27:52 You know the flame tests to see what type of metal there is?
general 2022-10-05 22:28:31 Basically, group 1 and 2 metals burn with a distinct colour, except for magnesium which emits light that isn't visible
general 2022-10-05 22:30:02 I don't remember which ones burn which colours exactlybut I remember there I think lithium or sodium burns red. Potassium burns lilac. Something burns green
general 2022-10-05 22:30:18 And one thing burns like a yellowy colour
general 2022-10-05 22:30:46 Paper isn't a metal

general 2022-10-06 15:55:16 No. I just don't need a laser to see where I'm aiming
general 2022-10-06 15:55:31 Besides, tracers help the enemy see you shoot8ng
general 2022-10-06 15:56:04 Which shvak is this
general 2022-10-06 15:56:19 I'll check in a few hours
general 2022-10-06 15:56:38 I think I used universal because incendiary on the Mgs
general 2022-10-06 15:56:52 Nah
general 2022-10-06 15:57:04 API isn't tracer
general 2022-10-06 15:57:18 API T is tracer
general 2022-10-06 15:57:33 But then the enemy sees the shots so
general 2022-10-06 15:57:34 Fuck that
general 2022-10-06 15:57:48 I just use stealth or universal
general 2022-10-06 15:58:07 Why would I want them to know I'm shooting them
general 2022-10-06 15:58:36 No trust me you won't believe how many people only realise someone is behind them because if the tracer
general 2022-10-06 15:58:54 You only see that if you do headons
general 2022-10-06 15:59:03 Are you stupid

general 2022-10-09 22:59:21 Can't lie you usually always stay neutral or out of these arguments so I think if you are making an opinion it's probably based off a lot of truth

general 2022-10-10 15:30:11 moral of the story, don't let people who don't design guns design guns
general 2022-10-10 15:30:28 Cheers

general 2022-10-10 16:55:58 It's funny how sea meteor can wing rip in level flight
general 2022-10-10 16:56:00 engines too good
general 2022-10-10 16:57:03 Meteor is good except roll rate and max wing rip really
general 2022-10-10 16:57:26 For an aircraft made in 1944 it is
general 2022-10-10 16:57:44 It's just overtiered
general 2022-10-10 16:57:59 Can't blame the aircraft for gaijin shitty moves
general 2022-10-10 16:58:45 Not really
general 2022-10-10 16:59:00 In terms of engine max it's just slightly slower than a 262
general 2022-10-10 16:59:08 like by 15kmh
general 2022-10-10 16:59:22 They are both 7.3
general 2022-10-10 16:59:42 F84 is 7.0 and 7.7
general 2022-10-10 17:00:09 Your point?
general 2022-10-10 17:00:31 Yaks are slow
general 2022-10-10 17:00:37 They still perform incredibly well
general 2022-10-10 17:00:45 I don't see why a meteor can't
general 2022-10-10 17:01:27 I just go and find an easier target
general 2022-10-10 17:01:37 no point chasing a faster plane than me across the map
general 2022-10-10 17:01:55 I have spidey sense

general 2022-10-10 17:03:08 You can't turn with me
general 2022-10-10 17:03:31 I can fight someone else and still be aware of my surroundings
general 2022-10-10 17:04:12 I'll just have to play defensively in a 2v1

general 2022-10-11 11:23:23 He "doesn't like wader"

general 2022-10-11 16:22:57 Wow
general 2022-10-11 16:23:00 What for?
general 2022-10-11 16:23:28 I don't know. I remember getting double warned and then banned once
general 2022-10-11 16:23:32 For a month
general 2022-10-11 16:23:40 Uh
general 2022-10-11 16:23:48 I think I got banned for a week in 2020 or 2021
general 2022-10-11 16:23:56 I forgot what for
general 2022-10-11 16:27:11 <@866848584888877077> Where did you get 18 from
general 2022-10-11 16:27:23 I only see 14 in the dyno messages
general 2022-10-11 16:28:50 These inflating my warns 💀
general 2022-10-11 16:28:51 modlogs I mean
general 2022-10-11 16:30:20 These are actually my only toxicity warns
general 2022-10-11 16:31:53 Hi mel
general 2022-10-11 16:33:20 wow
general 2022-10-11 17:33:28 Guys do you remember that spider I killed about 2 months ago?
general 2022-10-11 17:33:57 Oh well
general 2022-10-11 17:33:59 Anyway
general 2022-10-11 17:34:20 
general 2022-10-11 17:34:22 Found the web
general 2022-10-11 23:16:26 Cringe above
general 2022-10-11 23:16:35 gn
general 2022-10-12 11:53:18 I was answering a question and it turns out I recreated a suvat equation just to do it 💀
general 2022-10-12 11:53:25 Anyway
general 2022-10-12 11:53:37 It's a lot simpler than what the teacher was doing... which was also suvat
general 2022-10-12 11:53:50 Okay cya
general 2022-10-12 20:22:56 EW
general 2022-10-12 20:23:56 In war thunder in the 109 and the Yaks you caj do this as well
general 2022-10-12 20:24:00 but it's more
general 2022-10-12 20:24:13 rudder right, full up pitch and left roll
general 2022-10-12 20:24:39 It basically makes you go from 400kmh to stall speed in 1 seconds
general 2022-10-12 20:24:56 And it's wonderful if you know how to escape or prevent a flatspin
general 2022-10-12 20:25:13 I know you are talking about DCS
general 2022-10-12 20:25:34 But it's a similar maneuvere that's why I brought it up
general 2022-10-12 20:25:50 Not necessarily
general 2022-10-12 20:26:30 If you are in a low speed dogfight it's not bad
general 2022-10-12 20:27:16 You are overestimating the climb capabilities of an aircraft going 250kmh
general 2022-10-12 20:27:55 It doesn't take very long for a 109 to accelerate from 170kmh to 250kmh
general 2022-10-12 20:28:26 You can
general 2022-10-12 20:28:50 Bro are you mad
general 2022-10-12 20:29:03 You can keep your nose pointed up even at 190kmh
general 2022-10-12 20:29:10 How tf do you think you land
general 2022-10-12 20:29:16 Your nose is up even at 150kmh
general 2022-10-12 20:31:33 Well it depends on the situation obviously
general 2022-10-12 20:31:47 There isn't just "do a fancy pull and you're good"
general 2022-10-12 20:31:51 This isn't red tails
general 2022-10-12 20:34:16 You are a brainlet pilot <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-10-12 20:34:26 I beat you
general 2022-10-12 20:34:58 After 15 minutes. I killed you 4 times between then
general 2022-10-12 20:35:16 I had a water leak too
general 2022-10-12 20:36:07 You killed me twice in 1 hour, you suck
general 2022-10-12 20:36:50 
general 2022-10-12 20:37:19 I could just use the hat on my joystick
general 2022-10-12 20:37:27 but I opt not too because it's less immersive
general 2022-10-12 20:37:46 It's harder to see with a VR headset btw
general 2022-10-12 20:37:56 All it does is give you more peripheral
general 2022-10-12 20:38:14 Yes you can bro what are you on about
general 2022-10-12 20:38:36 Use your eyes then for the fine ones
general 2022-10-12 20:40:52 So?
general 2022-10-12 20:41:00 Plenty of good players only use keyboard and mouse
general 2022-10-12 20:44:24 Oh really? All you learnt was nothing using a keyboard and mouse. I had to learn to use an entire different system
general 2022-10-12 20:46:21 Easy? 

>literally using aircraft controls
general 2022-10-12 20:46:42 <@315262125113081856> Why don't you use a controller if mouse and keyboard is so bad
general 2022-10-12 20:47:17 It's physically demanding as well compared to a mouse
general 2022-10-12 20:47:35 It does
general 2022-10-12 20:47:40 Yes
general 2022-10-12 20:48:53 Try holding a joystick for 3 hours then you'll see
general 2022-10-12 20:48:59 Infact
general 2022-10-12 20:49:05 Hold your arm up for 5 minutes
general 2022-10-12 20:50:27 Thrustmaster airbus Sidestick. It's very nice and relatively inexpensive for a 1st joystick
general 2022-10-12 20:50:42 I put my elbow on the table
general 2022-10-12 20:50:48 When I can anyway
general 2022-10-12 20:51:17 Nice
general 2022-10-12 20:51:38 Do you have rudder pedals?
general 2022-10-12 20:51:47 Ah
general 2022-10-12 20:51:56 Pedals are so useful
general 2022-10-12 20:52:00 Oh
general 2022-10-12 20:52:20 Even with pedals it is so difficult
general 2022-10-12 20:52:27 You'll have to practice it a lot
general 2022-10-12 20:54:31 You are rich my guy you can afford that
general 2022-10-12 20:57:46 DCS looks fun but I don't wanna invest time into it
general 2022-10-12 20:58:03 I have IL 2 sturmovik anyway. That will run on my PC now but it didn't last year
general 2022-10-12 20:58:11 so on the weekend I'll finally learn to play it
general 2022-10-12 20:58:20 Too complicated
general 2022-10-12 20:58:24 more complicated than irl plane
general 2022-10-12 20:59:41 Wait <@287454032250011649> You only got your sticks yesterday that's why you think it's easy
general 2022-10-12 21:00:26 It's not even a strength thing
general 2022-10-12 21:00:47 I don't even play 2 hours per day
general 2022-10-12 21:00:57 Most play time I get is on the weekend
general 2022-10-12 21:01:20 3 hour games on the weekends
general 2022-10-12 21:01:30 but that's not 3 hours everyday for 7 days a week lol
general 2022-10-12 21:01:52 What
general 2022-10-12 21:02:09 Oh
general 2022-10-12 21:02:12 and rudders are worse
general 2022-10-12 21:02:32 Rudders are a nightmare for leg endurance
general 2022-10-12 21:03:13 A lot of aircraft don't have rudder trim 😭
general 2022-10-12 21:03:23 Or aeleron trim
general 2022-10-12 21:04:43 Just read the manual
general 2022-10-12 21:05:00 Startup is just following instructions
general 2022-10-12 21:07:11 It's easy to escape a flatspin in an F14
general 2022-10-12 21:07:38 Do you even know how to escape a normal flatspin?
general 2022-10-12 21:07:57 Anyway you have seperate engine throttles use it
general 2022-10-12 21:08:33 Don't flatspin 200 feet above then
general 2022-10-12 21:09:12 Before they knew the technique to escape them, no. After pilots were taught how to they generally should be able to as long as they have altitude
general 2022-10-12 21:10:01 You are the reason the FAA sets rules about aerobatic stunts
general 2022-10-12 21:10:10 Nah
general 2022-10-12 21:10:26 I'm not going to spend 80 dollars over a petty discord argument
general 2022-10-12 21:10:57 I know you can do that but still
general 2022-10-12 21:11:03 I'm too lazy <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-10-12 21:11:32 Not really
general 2022-10-12 21:11:55 F14 is cool but it's not really my thing
general 2022-10-12 21:12:59 Anyway
general 2022-10-12 21:13:15 <@287454032250011649> Don't be silly. Fly safely
general 2022-10-12 21:14:02 And don't try pull high G maneuvers at low speed or altitude
general 2022-10-12 21:14:21 You are not maverick
general 2022-10-12 21:14:38 They are related
general 2022-10-12 21:15:06 No shit
general 2022-10-12 21:15:22 "Try"
general 2022-10-12 21:15:38 to a certain degree
general 2022-10-12 21:16:14 It will depend on how maneuverable the plane is at the certain speed and what it's G Tolerances are of course
general 2022-10-12 21:16:37 Hey well at least the pilots lived

general 2022-10-12 21:24:03 <@287454032250011649> https://youtu.be/2wcQ8ayVjAQ I found this
general 2022-10-12 21:24:09 just by chance as well
general 2022-10-12 21:24:23 I didn't even type in DCS or F14
general 2022-10-12 21:24:39 Oh yeah
general 2022-10-12 21:24:50 Basically a death sentence at low alt
general 2022-10-12 21:25:00 Unless you are in a WW2 era prop or something
general 2022-10-12 21:32:20 How
general 2022-10-12 21:32:47 Bruh
general 2022-10-12 21:33:37 If you flatspin at high altitude just use the rudders instead of engine
general 2022-10-12 21:33:52 it will work and overcompensating from that is impossible
general 2022-10-12 21:33:57 It happens
general 2022-10-12 21:34:17 I know
general 2022-10-12 21:34:29 I'm just saying if you happen to at high altitude
general 2022-10-12 21:34:38 So you don't have that risk of overcompensation
general 2022-10-12 21:36:21 Well I'm gonna sleep
general 2022-10-12 21:36:24 gn
general 2022-10-13 15:55:15 Wow
general 2022-10-13 15:55:23 They refitted the seats on the bus
general 2022-10-13 15:55:44 
general 2022-10-13 15:58:30 Bus was moving so it was harder to keep the camera stable

general 2022-10-14 15:28:42 That makes sense
general 2022-10-14 15:29:13 But it's still acting as a prefix in APFSDS

general 2022-10-19 20:49:56 Ah
general 2022-10-19 20:50:11 To be fair
general 2022-10-19 20:50:20 roles do nothing except you can have a cool coloured name
general 2022-10-19 20:50:42 The only users who care about roles because they are roles are just people with too much ego
general 2022-10-19 20:52:03 I have never tried one so yes I would
the-dump 2022-10-19 20:52:21 Alright
the-dump 2022-10-19 20:52:38 Hella cool my guy

bot-central 2022-10-19 20:55:29 Damn
bot-central 2022-10-19 20:56:33 Bruh
general 2022-10-19 20:57:53 Hi
general 2022-10-19 21:01:47 Pot
general 2022-10-19 21:01:48 Pog
general 2022-10-19 21:07:12 Neither
general 2022-10-19 21:07:33 It would be the Mig 29
general 2022-10-19 21:08:03 Su25 has perpendicular tailing wing edges
general 2022-10-19 21:08:54 Would be an Mi16 HIP probably
general 2022-10-19 21:09:07 Mi 17
general 2022-10-19 21:09:26 The newer versions anyway
general 2022-10-19 21:09:32 Since it has the pointier nose
general 2022-10-19 21:44:43 I assume you used

T = 2(pi)radius/velocity

T being the time taken for 1 revolution?
general 2022-10-19 21:45:06 Oh
general 2022-10-19 21:45:08 Well use that
general 2022-10-19 21:45:17 This is the actual equation for T
general 2022-10-19 21:45:45 w is omega
general 2022-10-19 21:45:53 Which is 2pi/T
general 2022-10-19 21:46:01 Yes I know
general 2022-10-19 21:46:11 I just rearranged it for you to solve for T
general 2022-10-19 21:46:35 Yes
general 2022-10-19 21:46:43 You want RPM right?
general 2022-10-19 21:47:40 I know what RPM is
general 2022-10-19 21:52:39 If you want RPM just do 1/T and multiply it by 60
general 2022-10-19 21:55:23 So remember
general 2022-10-19 21:55:47 2πRadius / Velocity = Time.

1/Time * 60 is your RPM
general 2022-10-19 21:56:00 Since speed in roblox is studs per second
general 2022-10-19 22:04:53 Well yeah that's what I was doing. It's just not an easy thing to understand if you haven't done it before. Which is why I was showing you the equation
general 2022-10-19 22:08:49 Sup
general 2022-10-19 22:10:37 Man i love water

general 2022-10-19 22:17:17 Most likely
general 2022-10-19 22:17:32 It's been a good 40 years since she was in power
general 2022-10-19 22:17:38 People change in that time
general 2022-10-19 22:17:58 Even Tony Blair of all people regrets the shit he's done

general 2022-10-22 12:14:26 It's like tech support low quality but on steroids
general 2022-10-22 12:15:52 I have squashed

general 2022-10-22 12:19:51 Yes. It is I
general 2022-10-22 12:19:56 What wisdom do you seek?
general 2022-10-22 12:34:27 The shitted train is ready
general 2022-10-22 12:35:11 I instantly stalled the engine
general 2022-10-22 12:35:12 s
general 2022-10-22 12:37:32 I reached 300kmh before derailing
general 2022-10-22 12:40:09 IM FAST AS FUCK
general 2022-10-22 12:40:54 AH
general 2022-10-22 12:41:19 I should add more fans
general 2022-10-22 12:41:20 Or a gearbox
general 2022-10-22 12:43:15 Nah it's slower with gearbox
general 2022-10-22 12:43:43 More fans
general 2022-10-22 12:49:03 I should add more engines to the train
general 2022-10-22 12:50:30 Nah
general 2022-10-22 12:50:32 That's cringe
general 2022-10-22 12:50:36 Supercharged V12 power
general 2022-10-22 12:52:10 Goodnight
general 2022-10-22 12:53:12 WHY IS IT GOING SLOWER
general 2022-10-22 12:53:14 I added 3 more engines
general 2022-10-22 12:53:21 Barely getting 270 now
general 2022-10-22 12:54:24 Reeee
general 2022-10-22 13:06:46 Oh
general 2022-10-22 13:06:48 The 6 engine train
general 2022-10-22 13:06:52 3 of the engines weren't even powered
general 2022-10-22 13:06:59 I forgot to hook up the connectors
general 2022-10-22 13:07:55 Let'#s goooo
general 2022-10-22 13:08:15 Ah fuck
general 2022-10-22 13:08:35 It's okay guys
general 2022-10-22 13:08:44 As long as I have fuel my 6 Supercharged V12 engines will keep me alive
general 2022-10-22 13:08:53 I am currently leaving the atmosphere
general 2022-10-22 13:09:39 Hi mildis
general 2022-10-22 13:10:41 I will show my screen
general 2022-10-22 13:10:42 watch
general 2022-10-22 13:18:57 Yes
general 2022-10-22 13:18:59 Come watch tho
general 2022-10-22 13:19:03 This shit accelerates hard
general 2022-10-22 13:19:53 Uh oh
general 2022-10-22 13:19:57 That never happened before
general 2022-10-22 13:20:11 Mf ships
general 2022-10-22 13:20:41 They shot my engine tho :(
general 2022-10-22 13:20:45 eNGINS
general 2022-10-22 13:21:03 6 Supercharged V12 engines
general 2022-10-22 13:21:10 Connected to fans
general 2022-10-22 13:21:11 of course
general 2022-10-22 13:22:04 I forgor to
general 2022-10-22 13:22:41 Lol
general 2022-10-22 13:23:57 Ah yeah
general 2022-10-22 13:25:39 This shit is heavy
general 2022-10-22 13:26:43 Yeah I'm quite happy
general 2022-10-22 13:27:35 More air
general 2022-10-22 13:28:00 Yes
general 2022-10-22 13:28:10 You know normally with fuel intake and air intakes
general 2022-10-22 13:28:29 You can never have 1 as the intake value on the fuel otherwise your engine will be flooded
general 2022-10-22 13:28:36 If you just had a single fuel and air intake
general 2022-10-22 13:28:39 But with a supercharger
general 2022-10-22 13:28:44 You can have 1 on the fuel intake
general 2022-10-22 13:28:46 Basically
general 2022-10-22 13:28:51 You can add even more air and fuel into your engine
general 2022-10-22 13:28:58 Without adding 50 more intakes
general 2022-10-22 13:29:07 And it makes a huge difference in power
general 2022-10-22 13:29:32 My supercharger is just a small impeller pump
general 2022-10-22 13:29:55 Dayum
general 2022-10-22 13:30:03 Supercharger
general 2022-10-22 13:30:46 I reduce mass of train <:Trololo:924295063826231346>
general 2022-10-22 13:31:01 Yes
general 2022-10-22 13:31:03 Modular is so fun
general 2022-10-22 13:31:11 It's hard to get used to and you need an ECU generally but it's worth learning
general 2022-10-22 13:32:08 Nearly went 570 there before the front exploded
general 2022-10-22 13:32:24 Yeah
general 2022-10-22 13:32:55 Fleet is an ass
general 2022-10-22 13:33:51 Goodnighjt
general 2022-10-22 13:34:50 I should put these engines in a boat
general 2022-10-22 13:35:36 They don't overheat too my experience
general 2022-10-22 13:36:11 Supercharged don't
general 2022-10-22 13:36:54 I don't like when they shoot missiles at me
general 2022-10-22 13:37:37 ON GOD

general 2022-10-22 13:38:14 Wdym
general 2022-10-22 13:41:12 Why is this spontaneously combusting
general 2022-10-22 13:41:51 Perhaps
general 2022-10-22 13:42:48 Spoilers increase drag
general 2022-10-22 13:43:53 This could be the best drag racer

general 2022-10-22 15:20:07 <@403843930543882241> I think I found why my vehicle would disintegrate
general 2022-10-22 15:20:16 The wheels aren't even centres
general 2022-10-22 15:20:17 centred
general 2022-10-22 15:20:54 What is the diference?

general 2022-10-22 15:25:44 At this rpm
general 2022-10-22 15:26:07 They basically force more air into the engine
general 2022-10-22 15:27:54 152 litres left
general 2022-10-22 15:27:58 Give or take
general 2022-10-22 15:28:44 If you have a good ECU yeah
general 2022-10-22 15:29:48 Getting it to stay at a constant RPS is the hard part

general 2022-10-22 21:16:38 It's a simple tune but man the picking is a nightmare
general 2022-10-22 21:16:44 It's not even just normal alternating picking
general 2022-10-22 21:16:57 I think every 4th or 8th pick is harder
general 2022-10-22 21:17:38 Fair
general 2022-10-22 21:17:43 It's good anyway

general 2022-10-22 21:35:16 Also
general 2022-10-22 21:35:22 One thing about this I don't like
general 2022-10-22 21:35:27 It doesn't take heavier guage strings
general 2022-10-22 21:35:38 I learnt that because I put too heavy gauge on and the bridge was just
general 2022-10-22 21:35:41 Wayyy too high]
general 2022-10-22 21:36:02 I wouldn't do that tho because I don't know shit about how it works
general 2022-10-22 21:36:08 Don't wanna mess around with stuff you know

general 2022-10-22 21:38:52 It's always learning on instruments really
general 2022-10-22 21:39:12 Wow the chat is super dead. It just looks like I've been spamming
general 2022-10-22 21:42:45 I've never heard it

general 2022-10-22 21:45:08 I've never seen guardians of the galaxy
general 2022-10-22 21:45:25 Maybe
general 2022-10-22 21:45:27 Probably wont
general 2022-10-22 21:45:37 I don't have a history of watching marvel movies really
general 2022-10-22 21:47:59 Does she even know how to fly

general 2022-10-22 21:48:26 Was it bad?
general 2022-10-22 21:48:40 Yep
general 2022-10-22 21:48:41 That's crea
general 2022-10-22 21:49:16 war tunder
general 2022-10-22 21:49:17 Inv
general 2022-10-22 21:49:32 i_johnmichael
general 2022-10-22 21:50:49 What br?
general 2022-10-22 21:52:50 Noob why don't you have 3.3
general 2022-10-22 22:00:27 Even Spitfire can't beat a zero in a turnfight
general 2022-10-22 22:00:34 Zero turns way better at lowspeed
general 2022-10-22 22:00:51 But Spitfires have the speed advantage and they compress less at higher speed I believe
general 2022-10-22 22:01:09 Man
general 2022-10-22 22:01:14 Miinty get 3.3 damnit
general 2022-10-22 22:01:17 I want to use Mb 157
general 2022-10-22 22:01:56 
general 2022-10-22 22:02:31 Spitfire landing flaps have low rip speed tho
general 2022-10-22 22:02:34 Only 160mph
general 2022-10-22 22:02:58 If you are trying to turnfight a zero while at stall speed you messed up really bad somewhere
general 2022-10-22 22:03:33 Yeah true
general 2022-10-22 22:03:43 Climbrate on it higher than early jets
general 2022-10-22 22:04:12 I could take Spitfire 2b but MB 157 mmm
general 2022-10-22 22:04:35 Yes
general 2022-10-22 22:04:38 712kmh at 3.3
general 2022-10-22 22:04:46 I know
general 2022-10-22 22:04:49 And it's got 2 20mms
general 2022-10-22 22:05:09 Hispano 404 tho
general 2022-10-22 22:05:10 They go fast
general 2022-10-22 22:05:37 No I mean you use ammo fast
general 2022-10-22 22:06:09 Yeah like
general 2022-10-22 22:06:12 850 rpm
general 2022-10-22 22:07:12 I think all Yaks are like that in WT
general 2022-10-22 22:08:04 My MB 157 doing the same
general 2022-10-22 22:08:08 Unless it's just the texture being uneven
general 2022-10-22 22:13:55 I'm down to 90k
general 2022-10-22 22:14:01 I just spent 140k on experting MB 1157
general 2022-10-22 22:14:02 157
general 2022-10-22 22:14:16 I don't like saving money
general 2022-10-22 22:14:19 Because it just sits there
general 2022-10-22 22:14:21 Not being spent
general 2022-10-22 22:15:01 If MB 157 didn't have insanely high rip speed I wouldn't have survived that round
general 2022-10-22 22:15:09 Sure

general 2022-10-23 00:00:38 Actually
general 2022-10-23 00:00:45 There is a huge difference between 15 and 17
general 2022-10-23 00:00:47 Like
general 2022-10-23 00:00:56 Really big difference
general 2022-10-23 00:01:34 There is very little time difference, but the proportion of your life that those 2 years takes up is huge
general 2022-10-23 00:01:42 and your brain does a lot of changing between 15 and 17
general 2022-10-23 00:01:52 Stop smoking then
general 2022-10-23 00:02:27 It's funny because it's not even 12 years old
general 2022-10-23 00:02:40 Reach came out in 2011
general 2022-10-23 00:02:56 Oh
general 2022-10-23 00:02:58 Nevermind
general 2022-10-23 00:03:03 It is 12 years old
general 2022-10-23 00:03:27 I spent my life thinking it came out in september 2011, it's september 2010
general 2022-10-23 00:03:42 I don't know
general 2022-10-23 00:03:56 At this age it isn't
general 2022-10-23 00:04:14 40 to 42 is tiny, but 15 to 17 is massive
general 2022-10-23 00:04:54 That's fucking gigantic
general 2022-10-23 00:05:29 What
general 2022-10-23 00:06:01 1/9th of your life at 17 is roughly 2 years

general 2022-10-23 00:13:53 I didn't use the kinect
general 2022-10-23 00:14:03 my brother bought it but I never understood how it works
general 2022-10-23 00:14:58 My favourite game on the Xbox 360 was Halo 3 of course

general 2022-10-23 00:21:43 Halo 5 isn't canon <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-10-23 00:22:03 Halo 5 was absolute trash. I'm glad I played it through gamepass instead of buying that utter shit
general 2022-10-23 00:22:43 Ronnie pickering
general 2022-10-23 00:23:21 Helloo
general 2022-10-23 00:23:59 STOP USING YOUR PHONE AND DRIVING <@456226577798135808>

general 2022-10-23 00:25:40 Wait
general 2022-10-23 00:25:42 Huh

general 2022-10-23 00:25:51 How the fuck
general 2022-10-23 00:26:27 I went to google to make sure I spelt her name correct and then sent it
general 2022-10-23 00:26:31 but you said the same thing
general 2022-10-23 00:29:16 Yeah but better to be safe
general 2022-10-23 00:30:07 Okey dokey well I'm gonna go to sleep
general 2022-10-23 00:30:13 Goodnight guys
general 2022-10-23 09:27:31 Good morning chat
general 2022-10-23 09:27:51 Modular?
general 2022-10-23 10:17:59 Like
general 2022-10-23 10:17:59 Have you got the throttle going to the air and fuel?
general 2022-10-23 10:18:02 In a correct ratio
general 2022-10-23 10:20:24 Just press the map button
general 2022-10-23 10:20:36 Or do you mean a map for monitor?
general 2022-10-23 10:24:08 Is it under load right now?
general 2022-10-23 10:24:18 If it is under load then it will only go as high as it can
general 2022-10-23 10:24:30 Oh
general 2022-10-23 10:24:37 Is it connected to an ECU or something?
general 2022-10-23 10:24:49 Uh
general 2022-10-23 10:24:49 Okay so it isn't
general 2022-10-23 10:25:05 If it isn't connected to anything it should just rev up to 60rps and max out
general 2022-10-23 10:25:25 Yeah so it's under load
general 2022-10-23 10:25:42 That's why it's not going higher lol
general 2022-10-23 10:26:03 You gotta connect your clutch to electricity and a throttle if you wanna control it
general 2022-10-23 10:28:17 It does
general 2022-10-23 10:28:41 You can navigate using the map alone if you are big brain but don't even try doing that at night
general 2022-10-23 10:28:57 Night navigation without a GPS or anything is a nightmare
general 2022-10-23 10:29:13 It's in the build menu
general 2022-10-23 10:29:40 
general 2022-10-23 10:32:28 Well long story short this train goes 629kmh
general 2022-10-23 10:32:32 I want to make it even faster
general 2022-10-23 10:33:01 I have 12, Single StageSupercharged V12 engines on this badboy
general 2022-10-23 10:33:12 And I'm going to connect 2 of them together
general 2022-10-23 10:33:23 NO
general 2022-10-23 10:33:30 I'm going to do ludicrous ideas
general 2022-10-23 10:33:31 YES I DO
general 2022-10-23 10:33:51 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1033404951612891146 It all started with this
general 2022-10-23 10:34:00 Nah nah nah
general 2022-10-23 10:34:05 Diesel engine only
general 2022-10-23 10:34:10 💪
general 2022-10-23 10:34:39 Use a PID for that
general 2022-10-23 10:35:23 <:chad:977653493148037120>
general 2022-10-23 10:40:24 The time has come
general 2022-10-23 10:40:51 24
general 2022-10-23 10:40:53 In total
general 2022-10-23 10:41:53 An error has occured
general 2022-10-23 10:42:45 I didn't even hit the bridge
general 2022-10-23 10:42:49 I just spontaneously detonated
general 2022-10-23 10:43:08 Anyway
general 2022-10-23 10:43:17 I didn't hit 2000kmh
general 2022-10-23 10:43:20 😭
general 2022-10-23 10:49:56 Breh
general 2022-10-23 10:50:06 I'mgonna go through this section slow
general 2022-10-23 10:50:10 And accelerate when I get past the bridge
general 2022-10-23 10:51:15 Alright
general 2022-10-23 10:51:21 There was no improvement in speed
general 2022-10-23 10:51:31 I think I know what is happening
general 2022-10-23 10:51:42 The drag from the fans on the rear train cancels any potential gain out
general 2022-10-23 10:51:49 Idk they always are
general 2022-10-23 10:53:32 I need to figure out a way to transfer power across carriages without adding fans on both
general 2022-10-23 10:53:34 Sure
general 2022-10-23 10:53:38 What you tryna do?
general 2022-10-23 10:54:31 Hmm lerts see then
general 2022-10-23 10:55:02 Okay
general 2022-10-23 10:56:02 I sent you a friend request <@740790456182636595>
general 2022-10-23 10:56:06 On steam
general 2022-10-23 10:56:50 You gotta make a multiplayer server btw
general 2022-10-23 10:57:04 I suppose I should do it since you're new to this
general 2022-10-23 10:58:08 Imagine he pulls it out and it actually looks good
general 2022-10-23 10:59:22 Alright
general 2022-10-23 10:59:35 Go to the multiplayer tab > friends and then join me
general 2022-10-23 10:59:48 Yeah I already made
general 2022-10-23 11:00:07 😱
general 2022-10-23 11:01:41 Oh yeah
general 2022-10-23 11:03:22 I made the server so I'm fine
general 2022-10-23 11:12:52 close
general 2022-10-23 11:13:07 Nvm it ran out of fuel
general 2022-10-23 11:13:26 This engine went through 5 large fuel tanks in like 2 minutes
general 2022-10-23 11:17:47 Yeah
general 2022-10-23 11:20:58 I love the sound of these prefab engines tho ngl
general 2022-10-23 11:24:10 <@740790456182636595> noob installed his monitor upside down
general 2022-10-23 11:39:33 <@740790456182636595> I would reccomend setting it up so that if the temperature is 110 or above an alarm goes off
general 2022-10-23 11:39:39 Or
general 2022-10-23 11:39:40 113
general 2022-10-23 11:39:49 Threshold gate
general 2022-10-23 11:40:19 You can also use DELTA (input) and threshold gate if you wanna do if a change is too high
general 2022-10-23 11:40:35 Like if your RPM drops too fast an alarm goes off
general 2022-10-23 11:40:38 That type of thing
general 2022-10-23 11:40:48 Yes
general 2022-10-23 11:41:12 You can make an alarm for anything
general 2022-10-23 11:41:43 No
general 2022-10-23 11:41:51 Radios are just useful for multiplayer
general 2022-10-23 11:42:09 GPS maps
general 2022-10-23 11:42:14 For navigation
general 2022-10-23 11:42:25 That's the main thing imo
general 2022-10-23 11:42:46 Well it's a little tricky
general 2022-10-23 11:42:51 I can give you my one if you want
general 2022-10-23 11:43:02 So that I could see what I was working with
general 2022-10-23 11:43:14 Just copy paste the roof off your old one
general 2022-10-23 11:43:16 And place it there
general 2022-10-23 11:44:28 I've never done that before but I would just use a PID and output a number to a robotic pivot
general 2022-10-23 11:44:31 Which has fins attached
general 2022-10-23 11:44:55 It's a little too complicated for me to explain
general 2022-10-23 11:45:10 Because even I have not used PID that much
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 11:47:09 (He is alt) <:Trololo:924295063826231346>
general 2022-10-23 11:48:20 Really?
general 2022-10-23 11:48:31 I never had that issue before
general 2022-10-23 11:48:42 Just put a pipe going up
general 2022-10-23 11:48:44 and use a fluid port
general 2022-10-23 11:49:15 Oh
general 2022-10-23 11:49:21 No no that's just me pressing the wrong key by accident
general 2022-10-23 11:49:45 I can google it tho
general 2022-10-23 11:50:48 Ah
general 2022-10-23 11:51:20 Yeah well it's that or spanish accents
general 2022-10-23 11:52:46 What the fuck
general 2022-10-23 11:57:21 Oh yeah
general 2022-10-23 11:57:25 You can't use suspension on tracks
general 2022-10-23 11:57:29 It's really annoying
general 2022-10-23 12:00:10 Hi mildis
general 2022-10-23 12:06:26 I usually just replace the entire track at that point

general 2022-10-23 20:06:46 Playing war thunder on dialup 💀
general 2022-10-23 20:07:12 I don't takeoff with flaps except combat flaps
general 2022-10-23 20:07:26 Except for Seafire FR 47 I use takeoff flaps on that
general 2022-10-23 20:07:47 <@652925710976942100> Why did you stare at the image lol
general 2022-10-23 20:08:27 You think he's got bad ones
general 2022-10-23 20:08:30 You should see my phone gallery
general 2022-10-23 20:08:38 I have 3000 downloaded images, most of which are sussy ratios
general 2022-10-23 20:08:40 and speechbubbles
general 2022-10-23 20:08:54 I love the P-63 cockpit because I can actually see the runway during takeoff
general 2022-10-23 20:09:42 I should play air sim for you guys someday
general 2022-10-23 20:09:44 Maybe tuesday
general 2022-10-23 20:10:57 L bozo
general 2022-10-23 20:11:22 You should invest in some crew
general 2022-10-23 20:12:00 Me doing this in the spitfire and losing my engine
general 2022-10-23 20:12:27 Yeah the early ones had big carbaretor problems
general 2022-10-23 20:12:32 Not very much
general 2022-10-23 20:12:45 The 1s and 2s cut out very easily
general 2022-10-23 20:12:53 The 9s don't cut out that much
general 2022-10-23 20:13:01 Griffon ones rarely
general 2022-10-23 20:13:16 Literally the only time I seen it is you using it yesterday so I can't comment
general 2022-10-23 20:13:30 IT MEANS POINT YOUR NOSE DOWN
general 2022-10-23 20:13:47 Doodoo brain
general 2022-10-23 20:14:15 What keys do you guys use for your throttle?
general 2022-10-23 20:14:50 I don't bother doing the negative G stuff because my crew is leveled so much it doesn't change my turn rate
general 2022-10-23 20:14:57 At least for Britain
general 2022-10-23 20:15:18 I don't mind
general 2022-10-23 20:15:25 I nearly have ACE for my Mk 9
general 2022-10-23 20:15:31 Only need 100k more RP for it
general 2022-10-23 20:16:11 I don't buy premium
general 2022-10-23 20:16:25 I'm not gey I know how to fly
general 2022-10-23 20:16:29 without some stupidly op aircraft

general 2022-10-23 20:20:56 SUS
general 2022-10-23 20:21:15 What was your main
general 2022-10-23 20:21:46 What was your main account
general 2022-10-23 20:23:10 Do you even play plane crazy
general 2022-10-23 20:24:24 Well he plays it
general 2022-10-23 20:24:28 It was his VERY FIRST game
general 2022-10-23 20:24:55 You
general 2022-10-23 20:25:33 Yes when I finish my dinner
general 2022-10-23 20:27:02 As an avid spitfire player I can confirm that is the average landing after a water leak
general 2022-10-23 20:27:36 What plane did you get btw?
general 2022-10-23 20:28:15 Fun fact: the difference is negligible
general 2022-10-23 20:28:39 I like the P38 cockpit
general 2022-10-23 20:28:44 I want to use it in sim
general 2022-10-23 20:28:47 Actually
general 2022-10-23 20:28:55 Pretty much every american aircraft has a beautiful cockpit
general 2022-10-23 20:29:00 Only thing is
general 2022-10-23 20:29:08 I don't wanna grind another tree
general 2022-10-23 20:29:27 I could use the F6F, F8F and P63 through france tho
general 2022-10-23 20:29:45 Britain
general 2022-10-23 20:30:11 Cool ass aircraft but don't bother if you are an American aim
general 2022-10-23 20:30:15 You won't hit shit with only 4 guns

general 2022-10-23 21:46:10 Average ego war thunder player
general 2022-10-23 21:46:19 Sweet#
general 2022-10-23 21:46:25 If this counts
general 2022-10-23 21:48:56 Hi
general 2022-10-23 21:49:38 I have to have a shower
general 2022-10-23 21:49:39 Cya chat
general 2022-10-23 22:17:44 Wow
general 2022-10-23 22:18:06 Hi hype
general 2022-10-23 22:18:18 You guys are so weak
general 2022-10-23 22:18:26 <@853042393309904897> let's see then
general 2022-10-23 22:19:18 Pump the water out from the side of the ship near the top instead of the bottom because if you do it at the bottom the water pressure makes it mors difficult
general 2022-10-23 22:19:56 I thouvht you would DM that but pog
general 2022-10-23 22:22:45 there is a girl and a creepy ghost
general 2022-10-23 22:23:37 Ya but you will probably want a lot more pump than that
general 2022-10-23 22:23:50 And don't put them in series
general 2022-10-23 22:23:54 Have seperate loops
general 2022-10-23 22:24:00 Otherwise the flowrate dies
general 2022-10-23 22:24:37 Probably more than 1
general 2022-10-23 22:24:51 draining a bilge tank at 75 Ls takes forever
general 2022-10-23 22:25:16 It's not believe me I've tried
general 2022-10-23 22:25:25 It's like waiting for the sun to explode
general 2022-10-23 22:25:31 Just doesn't happen
general 2022-10-23 22:25:46 So was my water tank
general 2022-10-23 22:26:34 On god
general 2022-10-23 22:27:07 No hablo español
general 2022-10-23 22:27:35 I only speak like 5 sentences in spanish
general 2022-10-23 22:28:34 Well you want to have coordinates that you can input and coordinates of your vehicle. Display them on a monitor, OR subtract your coords from the input coords to get the difference and display that
general 2022-10-23 22:28:47 if you know a little bit of lua you can make it so you get a bearing
general 2022-10-23 22:28:56 But remember, trig functions are in radians
general 2022-10-23 22:29:06 That bit isn't super hard dw
general 2022-10-23 22:31:27 Pigeons are cool
general 2022-10-23 22:31:31 I love pigeons
general 2022-10-23 22:31:53 It's a shame passenger pigeons went extinct
general 2022-10-23 22:33:05 Jenna's?
general 2022-10-23 22:33:28 I did that as a kid playing games
general 2022-10-23 22:35:53 North Korean M2020
general 2022-10-23 22:36:00 No
general 2022-10-23 22:36:41 
general 2022-10-23 22:36:59 
general 2022-10-23 22:37:31 Yeah
general 2022-10-23 22:38:19 Looks alright, probably doesn't function alright
general 2022-10-23 22:38:38 Threshold gate and a buzzer
general 2022-10-23 22:39:04 Connect the threshold gate to a fuel metre, set the litres you want it to set the alarm off at
general 2022-10-23 22:39:10 and then connect it to the buzzer
general 2022-10-23 22:39:54 <@456226577798135808> You christian?
general 2022-10-23 22:40:01 Probably not
general 2022-10-23 22:40:44 The more you know
general 2022-10-23 22:40:57 He prays to me 🙏
general 2022-10-23 22:42:18 Whay
general 2022-10-23 22:42:25 Don't connect it to fuel level
general 2022-10-23 22:42:45 Connect it to the litres
general 2022-10-23 22:43:02 How would it be going up and down??
general 2022-10-23 22:43:32 Cardboard box from that one spongebob episode
general 2022-10-23 22:43:44 The best kind
general 2022-10-23 22:43:49 I wanted to do that shit as a kid
general 2022-10-23 22:43:57 Show vid?
general 2022-10-23 22:44:07 Or show the setup
general 2022-10-23 22:44:16 OH WAIT
general 2022-10-23 22:44:20 I might know
general 2022-10-23 22:44:35 If you do negative G the fuel can get pulled down the pipes back into your tank
general 2022-10-23 22:44:56 Actually that would be positive G for the ship
general 2022-10-23 22:45:05 Negative G would draw it up into the pipes
general 2022-10-23 22:45:29 Have your engines got cooling system?
general 2022-10-23 22:45:40 Hmm
general 2022-10-23 22:45:59 elon musk brai  chip
general 2022-10-23 22:46:39 Why have you got multiple coolant manifolds to the same radiator?
general 2022-10-23 22:46:57 You're gonna pump hot water into the engine
general 2022-10-23 22:47:13 Just connect  the cylinders with a manifold insteD
general 2022-10-23 22:47:16 instead
general 2022-10-23 22:47:22 And then use 1 coolant manifold
general 2022-10-23 22:47:36 Go to the block inventory
general 2022-10-23 22:47:43 Do you see engine manifold blocks
general 2022-10-23 22:48:08 Yes
general 2022-10-23 22:48:14 Oh
general 2022-10-23 22:48:29 You can use salt water as long as the engine isn't above 100c
general 2022-10-23 22:48:58 If it's above 100c it will start scaling up and damage the engine
general 2022-10-23 22:49:14 Ay ay delete
general 2022-10-23 22:49:29 It had sus
general 2022-10-23 22:49:55 You don't need to do that. Radiators already have fresh water inside them
general 2022-10-23 22:51:29 I bet that's warm af
general 2022-10-23 22:52:35 No but they are useful if you need torque
general 2022-10-23 22:53:01 Clutch, flywheel, clutch
general 2022-10-23 22:53:29 So you don't put too much load on your engine
general 2022-10-23 22:53:47 Can I see the logic?
general 2022-10-23 22:54:15 Well no shit it's not working then lol
general 2022-10-23 22:54:29 You gotta connect it to a threshold gate and then a buzzer
general 2022-10-23 22:54:44 For an alarm
general 2022-10-23 22:54:54 Oh
general 2022-10-23 22:55:06 Connect the temperature probe to the crankshaft
general 2022-10-23 22:56:59 Hi chips
general 2022-10-23 22:58:01 
general 2022-10-23 22:58:17 This was in my physics class about 2 weeks ago
general 2022-10-23 22:58:21 Good
general 2022-10-23 22:58:57 It only overheats once it hits 115°
general 2022-10-23 22:59:00 It will go on fire
general 2022-10-23 22:59:13 But you wanna keep it as cool as possible anyway to keep it more efficient
general 2022-10-23 22:59:37 What?
general 2022-10-23 23:00:03 Not much just like

general 2022-10-23 23:04:56 Series is connecting 2 or more radiators in the same loop. That will turn your flowrate from 50 to 20 it's so nad
general 2022-10-23 23:04:59 bad

general 2022-10-23 23:09:20 GPS doesn't display it. But if you go into the lua block in the mc editor you can connect the map to a screen.  They have a preset code for that which you can just copy paste in
general 2022-10-23 23:09:56 You gotta learn the microcontroller editor
general 2022-10-23 23:10:09 There are tutorials that can explain it much better than me

general 2022-10-23 23:27:09 And in some ways I regret it because it was my best friend. But in other ways I'm glad it happened because it changed me for the better

general 2022-10-24 00:29:55 <@697893501274161325> I downloaddd before you deleted
general 2022-10-24 00:30:25 It's the equation for a straight line you dumb dumb
general 2022-10-24 00:30:34 Hi chips, why your head hurt?
general 2022-10-24 00:31:13 Yes <:clueless:974805770585641012>
general 2022-10-24 00:31:46 That's gradient but yeah
general 2022-10-24 00:31:59 slope gradient
general 2022-10-24 00:32:13 Gradient isn't the equation for a line
general 2022-10-24 00:32:31 Wdym
general 2022-10-24 00:32:44 How do you not know what a gradient is
general 2022-10-24 00:32:48 Or is it gradiant?
general 2022-10-24 00:32:51 How do you spell it
general 2022-10-24 00:33:17 Gradient:)
general 2022-10-24 00:33:28 It's not
general 2022-10-24 00:33:56 Well yeah but no

general 2022-10-24 00:34:10 Dayum
general 2022-10-24 00:34:36 Yoy guys know Y2 - Y1 = M(X2 - X1)  ?
general 2022-10-24 00:37:37 7x - 35 + 8 = 6x - 27

7x - 27 = 6x - 27

7x - 6x = 27 - 27

so x = 0 💀
general 2022-10-24 00:37:43 Wack
general 2022-10-24 00:39:19 Simple math
general 2022-10-24 00:39:55 This is a basic ass simultaneous
general 2022-10-24 00:40:25 Yeah something like that
general 2022-10-24 00:40:38 Start of year 10 is when you learn to solve for X in more complicated forms

general 2022-10-24 02:00:47 So right now my pulse is around 65bpm and oxygen is 98% which is good

general 2022-10-24 02:01:45 oxygen level in your blood
general 2022-10-24 02:01:59 You slap it on your finger and it shines some magical laser through

general 2022-10-25 00:06:27 Wai <@883063424614006878> The sabre only has 50 cals right?
general 2022-10-25 00:06:35 Oof

general 2022-10-25 00:06:59 Fair
general 2022-10-25 00:07:07 If you can aim good it's not gonna be awful

general 2022-10-25 00:10:19 Can't lie, even if my teamate got into some goofy situation and I'd probably die, I'm obligated to help them
general 2022-10-25 00:10:38 I will risk my wings ripping to save someone
general 2022-10-25 00:11:19 Very rare indeed
general 2022-10-25 00:11:50 You rush to them you might just make it in the nick of time
general 2022-10-25 00:12:26 Random squads are so annoying
general 2022-10-25 00:12:51 I feel bad sometimes when I can't make it in time
general 2022-10-25 00:13:02 Oh one thing
general 2022-10-25 00:13:17 Your teamate is in trouble always tell them to fly in your direction
general 2022-10-25 00:14:29 Maybe not in the heat of the moment but if's better to try save your teamate than just let them die
general 2022-10-25 00:15:24 They do but the irony about it is that they are actually quite cool engines in comparrison to some others
general 2022-10-25 00:15:36 They can run at high temperature on wep fine
general 2022-10-25 00:15:39 Just don't get a leak

general 2022-10-25 00:23:50 Like if I want anyone to hear me I have to turn the gain up a lot
general 2022-10-25 00:24:02 Find a perfect balance between loudness and clarity
general 2022-10-25 00:24:08 too much gain makes static
general 2022-10-25 00:24:21 Literally had to
general 2022-10-25 00:25:12 Anyway I gotta buy this bad boy and a desk before I can use mic again
general 2022-10-25 00:25:26 Are you gonna practice with your real voice tho?
general 2022-10-25 00:25:40 Basically an audio mixer
general 2022-10-25 00:25:47 To make it sound feminine
general 2022-10-25 00:26:15 Oh my bad
general 2022-10-25 00:26:32 I thought you meant using it because you didn't like your own voice I'm silly

general 2022-10-25 00:38:17 Question is tho, how long would that take for me to get
general 2022-10-25 00:39:42 Well I don't have 11.3 so I be the 1.0

general 2022-10-25 00:50:01 That looks cool
general 2022-10-25 00:50:26 I think the F104 looks cool tho
general 2022-10-25 00:50:40 Stupidly dangerous aircraft to fly irl but it looks good

general 2022-10-25 09:37:58 I did not hit back to the hanger
general 2022-10-25 09:38:03 But he did immediately after saying that
general 2022-10-25 09:38:56 I am 1 in 67 million
general 2022-10-25 09:39:18 Yep

general 2022-10-25 09:40:42 No he didn't
general 2022-10-25 09:40:44 He's in a 109
general 2022-10-25 09:40:48 I was killed by the P47
general 2022-10-25 09:41:06 They probably didn't irl
general 2022-10-25 09:41:09 It's just gaijin moment
general 2022-10-25 09:41:36 Yeah
general 2022-10-25 09:41:58 Practice rounds were mostly because if you shot HE down a barrel and it happen to be blocked, you were fucked
general 2022-10-25 09:42:04 practice rounds would clear the barrel
general 2022-10-25 09:42:48 Oh you know what pisses me off
general 2022-10-25 09:42:55 the CW spitfires had worse turn radius right
general 2022-10-25 09:42:57 That's known
general 2022-10-25 09:43:02 BUT
general 2022-10-25 09:43:09 The israeli cw spitfire has the same turn radius as a non cw
general 2022-10-25 09:43:12 Fucking gaijin
general 2022-10-25 09:47:41 😡
general 2022-10-25 09:50:46 5.0 atm just because I;m using aircraft i've never used befoer

general 2022-10-25 09:52:55 You're cringe

general 2022-10-25 09:54:06 Yes
general 2022-10-25 09:54:33 Good thing I'm not a British main then
general 2022-10-25 09:57:18 Silly goober
general 2022-10-25 09:58:28 Silly goober
general 2022-10-25 09:58:36 CW is actually not that bad
general 2022-10-25 09:58:39 I like the roll rate
general 2022-10-25 09:59:00 Also this is funny
general 2022-10-25 09:59:03 He first attacked me at 7k
general 2022-10-25 09:59:14 P38 is better at altitude than me so I dived
general 2022-10-25 09:59:17 And he followed
general 2022-10-25 09:59:39 I evaded his fire and he did the right move to try and go up but I still shot at him which fucked one of his engines
general 2022-10-25 10:00:32 I don't
general 2022-10-25 10:01:57 The ends haev been snipped off
general 2022-10-25 10:02:31 No
general 2022-10-25 10:03:34 The FW 190 was designed that way. The Spitfire had round wing tips but for the CW variants they were ofc removed
general 2022-10-25 10:04:44 I love rudder turns
general 2022-10-25 10:04:47 They are so useful
general 2022-10-25 10:04:55 And not rudder turns as in that shitty arcade mechanic
general 2022-10-25 10:05:03 I mean turning with the rudder when you are near stall speed
general 2022-10-25 10:05:27 In normal combat yeah
general 2022-10-25 10:05:36 But when you are at stall speed you turn hella fast using the rudder
general 2022-10-25 10:05:48 It's useful yk
general 2022-10-25 10:06:24 <@645396100265541664> You wanna do 5.0 or somewhere around that?
general 2022-10-25 10:06:53 Okay
general 2022-10-25 10:07:39 Ooh same aircraft
general 2022-10-25 10:08:05 <#384021699466756107> Is for plane crazy talk
general 2022-10-25 10:09:09 Look at this silly man with his default skin!!!
general 2022-10-25 10:19:23 Only aircraft where you return to base because of that lol
general 2022-10-25 10:20:22 Look again
general 2022-10-25 10:20:57 It's not
general 2022-10-25 10:21:00 But your gun will break
general 2022-10-25 10:21:28 Radiator
general 2022-10-25 10:32:37 GOD
general 2022-10-25 10:32:42 I hate mfs like that
general 2022-10-25 10:32:47 Yeah
general 2022-10-25 10:33:12 There was this guy who just airfield circled half the match
general 2022-10-25 10:33:39 He thought he could escape me as well when he finally left the AAA zone
general 2022-10-25 10:33:48 Pro tip:
general 2022-10-25 10:33:57 If an aircraft is chasing you in a shallow dive, don't do a steep dive
general 2022-10-25 10:43:00 <@645396100265541664> That game was wild lol
general 2022-10-25 10:43:11 But for a 2v4 I think we did pretty okay
general 2022-10-25 10:43:30 Especially considering they were altitude fighters
general 2022-10-25 10:43:54 What br tho
general 2022-10-25 10:44:04 Alrighty
general 2022-10-25 10:45:07 Lol

general 2022-10-25 11:17:23 I had 18 shells left and I crit him
general 2022-10-25 11:17:26 He was smoking
general 2022-10-25 11:17:35 I ran out that's why I flew into the back of him

general 2022-10-25 23:56:57 She's making sure you aren't going insane
general 2022-10-25 23:57:04 HOW
general 2022-10-25 23:57:31 By the power of allah he bypassed the ban
general 2022-10-25 23:58:03 <@883063424614006878> Whar did you even do that made you so tired??
general 2022-10-25 23:58:08 Or is it just one of those days

general 2022-10-26 09:10:39 Clearly the saddest lyrics are " fckmtf8rts8rt897" instead
general 2022-10-26 09:10:52 Not fake

general 2022-10-26 09:13:10 That's col
general 2022-10-26 09:13:47 Finland isn't even ther
general 2022-10-26 09:14:46 It is
general 2022-10-26 09:14:48 Sort of
general 2022-10-26 09:14:56 New vehicles are there
general 2022-10-26 09:15:00 Finland isn't
general 2022-10-26 09:15:12 Ah
general 2022-10-26 09:15:23 Yeah finland is there then
general 2022-10-26 09:59:16 Thank god
general 2022-10-26 10:15:38 Idk but it looks cool imo
general 2022-10-26 10:20:37 Bye chat
general 2022-10-26 12:18:38 I am arrived
general 2022-10-26 12:19:42 We would be very fucked as well
general 2022-10-26 12:20:22 I wouldn't want to be
general 2022-10-26 12:21:36 How
general 2022-10-26 12:22:16 I hate Tesco
general 2022-10-26 12:23:04 You know you can't even complain to tesco they make it extremely difficult
general 2022-10-26 12:23:10 You can only do it via mail

general 2022-10-26 12:26:31 When is PC2 update
general 2022-10-26 12:27:17 Bruh there aren't even 7 women in my physics class
general 2022-10-26 12:28:52 Mount Athos
general 2022-10-26 12:31:40 yes
general 2022-10-26 12:31:57 no
general 2022-10-26 12:33:40 Lmao
general 2022-10-26 12:34:05 https://tenor.com/view/cod-gif-20123483
general 2022-10-26 12:43:36 Alt
general 2022-10-26 12:43:57 Idk
general 2022-10-26 12:45:29 Can I ask where these numbers come from
general 2022-10-26 12:45:34 I understand the mass
general 2022-10-26 12:45:45 But what is the very large number
general 2022-10-26 12:45:53 And why is 0.118 * 2 ?
general 2022-10-26 12:46:04 And where did the surface area come form
general 2022-10-26 12:46:07 Surface area of what?
general 2022-10-26 12:46:15 no wait
general 2022-10-26 12:46:18 That's not even surface area
general 2022-10-26 12:46:38 That's just m/4
general 2022-10-26 12:47:37 I understand that but what are the numbers representing
general 2022-10-26 12:48:16 Goodnight
general 2022-10-26 12:48:49 No. I'm asking him what do the numbers represent. There are no units
general 2022-10-26 12:49:04 Or no things that really tell you what they are
general 2022-10-26 12:50:14 Can't fault you there haha
general 2022-10-26 12:50:29 Bro you're snorting lines right now as well
general 2022-10-26 12:50:33 Are you reading what I'm asking
general 2022-10-26 12:57:16 (3x10^8 ms^-1)^2 = (9x10^16 m^2 s^-2) Would be your speed of light squared
general 2022-10-26 12:58:18 4.14e+9 What is this number?
general 2022-10-26 12:59:26 Megatons is comparison to TNT
general 2022-10-26 13:00:54 I am confused how you are getting megatons from the (0.188*(9x10^16 m^2 s^-2)) / 4.14e+9
general 2022-10-26 13:01:04 OH
general 2022-10-26 13:01:05 Wait
general 2022-10-26 13:01:19 Were you trying to find kinetic energy?
general 2022-10-26 13:01:39 Because Ke = 1/2 mv^2 then I could see what you are doing
general 2022-10-26 13:11:03 ke = 1/2mv^2

1/2 (0.188kg*(9x10^16 m^2 s^-2)) = ke

= 8.46x10^15 Joules

Joules to megatons 4.184e+15


(8.46x10^15) Joules / (4.18x10^15) (The conversion ratio for Joules to megatons of TNT) = 2.023 megatons 

So if an antimatter banana was travelling at the speed of light all that kinetic energy was dispersed instantaneously yes it would be a very powerful equivalent to a nuclear bomb
general 2022-10-26 13:11:56 kinetic energy was dispersed instantaneously yes it would be a very powerful equivalent to a nuclear bomb
general 2022-10-26 13:11:59 Goofy ahh
general 2022-10-26 13:12:01 0 reading comprehension
general 2022-10-26 13:12:37 Yes
general 2022-10-26 13:13:36 He is goofy he doesn't know that
general 2022-10-26 13:14:01 Cya
general 2022-10-26 13:16:02 You literally use light speed in your original equation
general 2022-10-26 13:16:04 Which is wrong btw
general 2022-10-26 13:16:11 The formula for ke is 1/2mv^2
general 2022-10-26 13:16:33 yes
general 2022-10-26 13:16:38 In joules
general 2022-10-26 13:17:17 Dw Ke isn't super hard
general 2022-10-26 13:17:24 It's relating it to other equations that become a nightmare
general 2022-10-26 13:17:39 Ke is literally just punching numbers in
general 2022-10-26 13:18:32 You have a 50000kg yo mama travelling at 0.3 metres a second 

that is 1/2(50000)(0.3)^2

which is 2250 joules of energy
general 2022-10-26 13:18:39 Yo mama may be fat but she got some muscle to go that fast
general 2022-10-26 13:19:13 Hi mel
general 2022-10-26 13:20:18 Not at all
general 2022-10-26 13:20:54 What section of the banana hits the plate also I will probably need a lot more experience to calculate that
general 2022-10-26 13:21:03 I mean
general 2022-10-26 13:21:11 Pressure and force is simple as but
general 2022-10-26 13:21:20 Penetrating metal sheesh
general 2022-10-26 13:21:32 That banana had to be going hella fast
general 2022-10-26 13:21:52 Then it's not a banana
general 2022-10-26 13:22:00 That's just a massive chunk of uranium and titanium
general 2022-10-26 13:22:11 bro do you know what Silver is
general 2022-10-26 13:23:22 Is a Titanium covered Uranium banana made of Silver my guy ?
general 2022-10-26 13:24:03 Does the US army use a Titanium covered Uranium banana  BRO
general 2022-10-26 13:24:41 https://tenor.com/view/samuel-l-jackson-thats-all-you-had-to-say-pulp-fiction-gif-14346348
general 2022-10-26 13:26:12 There is also no velocity given here so I assume (if I could even calculate this) I would have to figure out the minimum velocity of the banana in order to penetrate
general 2022-10-26 13:26:18 But yeah
general 2022-10-26 13:26:25 That's too advanced for me (right now)
general 2022-10-26 13:28:28 You need expert rank
general 2022-10-26 13:28:36 Hello
general 2022-10-26 13:29:56 half
general 2022-10-26 13:29:58 But yeah
general 2022-10-26 13:30:18 I just use <#497142796961054721> only
general 2022-10-26 13:31:31 Ahh true
general 2022-10-26 13:32:38 Not if it's aerodynamic enough
general 2022-10-26 13:33:31 We have hypersonic missiles that don't just evaporate mid air
general 2022-10-26 13:33:41 And they are quite big
general 2022-10-26 13:34:26 The heat from the atmosphere comes from the compression of air, not the air friction
general 2022-10-26 13:34:42 Just imagine a perfectly straight banana
general 2022-10-26 13:35:06 What
general 2022-10-26 13:35:20 No just a banana that happen to grow straight instead of being bendy like most
general 2022-10-26 13:35:35 Like a ruler
general 2022-10-26 13:35:45 Typo
general 2022-10-26 13:35:49 He meant T-62
general 2022-10-26 13:36:39 Well which side of the banana do you want to hit
general 2022-10-26 13:36:46 Side on or pointy bit in
general 2022-10-26 13:36:52 Because that changes the values
general 2022-10-26 13:38:04 No. The side of a banana is flat
general 2022-10-26 13:38:22 Yes but it's a banana dipped in uranium and titanium
general 2022-10-26 13:38:24 Apparently
general 2022-10-26 13:39:07 We don't care about APFSDS we are talking about banan
general 2022-10-26 13:39:43 <@400119068704636938> You were the one who started this
general 2022-10-26 13:39:46 Don't ask us to leave
general 2022-10-26 13:40:25 20 minutes ago
general 2022-10-26 13:40:44 IT'S A BANANA SHELL IT'S NOT ABOUT REALISTIC APPLICATION
general 2022-10-26 13:41:21 If you do please show us the working out
general 2022-10-26 13:41:55 God I really have to learn ansys
general 2022-10-26 13:42:11 Well then you do have to take air resistance into account
general 2022-10-26 13:43:20 Hi
general 2022-10-26 13:43:26 Thanks
general 2022-10-26 13:44:06 Orbital banana is interesting but that would gothrough the turret or hull roof like nothing
general 2022-10-26 13:44:09 Less interesting
general 2022-10-26 13:48:26 What
general 2022-10-26 13:48:51 You don't need the acceleration to mach 7 to calculate the force it creates on a metal plate
general 2022-10-26 13:49:16 When it decelerates
general 2022-10-26 13:49:36 I know
general 2022-10-26 13:49:38 Rod from God
general 2022-10-26 13:54:26 You
general 2022-10-26 13:54:57 Yeah that's the thing I wanted to use that but I'm just not that level yet
general 2022-10-26 13:55:23 P = F/A is okay but it's just too simple for this imo
general 2022-10-26 14:01:08 gravity bro
general 2022-10-26 14:01:16 How do you think you fall when you jump
general 2022-10-26 14:01:44 And assuming that the acceleration is constant
general 2022-10-26 14:04:43 Acceleration generally is GM/r^2 
G being 6.67x10^-11 , M being the mass of your big object (the Earth) and R being (in this case, the height from the centre of the Earth)
general 2022-10-26 14:05:11 Once you get closer to the surface you can just use 9.81 ms^-2
general 2022-10-26 14:05:21 No
general 2022-10-26 14:05:31 Yes there is dude
general 2022-10-26 14:05:39 It's just smol (somewhat)
general 2022-10-26 14:05:54 Given enough time you will fall to the Earth
general 2022-10-26 14:06:21 Yeah
general 2022-10-26 14:06:30 Relativity wouldn't even be a thing
general 2022-10-26 14:06:59 Hi
general 2022-10-26 14:07:23 Don't worry
general 2022-10-26 14:07:32 a = GM/r^2
general 2022-10-26 14:07:43 .
general 2022-10-26 14:08:36 Well it won't be insanely big
general 2022-10-26 14:08:43 Anyway
general 2022-10-26 14:08:47 What do you want your starting height to be
general 2022-10-26 14:08:49 for the banana
general 2022-10-26 14:10:59 Tungsten banana?
general 2022-10-26 14:11:16 <@538169956735647745> What height do you want it to start at
general 2022-10-26 14:11:20 As in height above the earth
general 2022-10-26 14:13:25 Ah what is that 34,000km above the earth right?
general 2022-10-26 14:13:28 Around there
general 2022-10-26 14:13:44 Oh
general 2022-10-26 14:13:45 no it's not
general 2022-10-26 14:13:50 It's 100km
general 2022-10-26 14:14:11 This is for geostationary orbits my mistake
general 2022-10-26 14:17:19 i HAVE DRAWN this in paint.net
general 2022-10-26 14:17:21 Give me a momento
general 2022-10-26 14:18:12 I have never really used desmos so I'm not gonna try it now
general 2022-10-26 14:22:14 No
general 2022-10-26 14:22:18 It was 100km
general 2022-10-26 14:24:56 Okay
general 2022-10-26 14:24:58 It turns out
general 2022-10-26 14:25:29 The gravity 100km above the earth is not very different to surface level
general 2022-10-26 14:25:36 It's only 9.55ms^-2
general 2022-10-26 14:26:25 Okay <@538169956735647745> I'm just gonna use 34,000km instead
general 2022-10-26 14:26:42 0.24 sheesh
general 2022-10-26 14:32:31 <@432344306427101184> How do you use desmos
general 2022-10-26 14:32:50 I want it to draw a curve
general 2022-10-26 14:36:50 My bad
general 2022-10-26 14:36:54 It did draw it correctly but
general 2022-10-26 14:37:00 It's just smol so when I zoom out it looks straight
general 2022-10-26 14:37:17 How do I make it bigger tho
general 2022-10-26 14:38:03 
general 2022-10-26 14:38:14 It's for gravity at Y height above the Earth
general 2022-10-26 14:39:56 I just multiplied mine by 1000000
general 2022-10-26 14:40:03 Now that's what I'm talking about
general 2022-10-26 14:40:23 I wasn't talking about the circle equation
general 2022-10-26 14:40:41 Also why the hell do you use a for radius?
general 2022-10-26 14:40:45 What kinda goofy ahh system is that
general 2022-10-26 14:41:11 Anyway
general 2022-10-26 14:41:14 I'm not trying to do a circle
general 2022-10-26 14:41:25 I was just trying to show the acceleration as height changes
general 2022-10-26 14:41:38 gravitational acceleration
general 2022-10-26 14:42:51 You can't use that one
general 2022-10-26 14:43:01 Use a = GM/r^2
general 2022-10-26 14:43:19 (6.67x10^-11)(Mass) / Radius^2
general 2022-10-26 14:43:47 SUVAT only works closer to the surface
general 2022-10-26 14:44:40 It's what I learnt in physics like
general 2022-10-26 14:44:42 3 months ago
general 2022-10-26 14:44:43 Fun
general 2022-10-26 14:44:59 Confusing at first but it's nice once yk it
general 2022-10-26 14:47:54 I hate intrusive thoughts
general 2022-10-26 14:50:13 You were incorrect tho
general 2022-10-26 14:50:56 I'm gonna put that in my bio now <:Trololo:924295063826231346>

general 2022-10-26 14:59:52 Pringles cans wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure so it would just kind of leak like a phone battery fire
general 2022-10-26 15:01:03 Yeah but explosives work because there is an object to hold the pressure
general 2022-10-26 15:01:20 If there is no opposing object, the explosive material just burns instead

general 2022-10-26 18:26:31 <@370594904268734464> Welcome back
general 2022-10-26 18:26:57 I paused my music to type that 💀
general 2022-10-26 18:28:05 You joined 2 days ago how would you know if he was?
general 2022-10-26 18:28:07 Anyway no, not him
general 2022-10-26 18:28:18 Defo alt <@1033789103130546297>
general 2022-10-26 18:29:06 I know you said that
general 2022-10-26 18:29:08 I still don't believe it
general 2022-10-26 18:29:40 <@370594904268734464> You should have been here earlier
general 2022-10-26 18:29:54 We were arguing about bananas as bombs
general 2022-10-26 18:30:13 and if a uranium + titanium dipped banana hit a T-62 glacis plate
general 2022-10-26 18:30:59 We didn't invent anything
general 2022-10-26 18:32:04 That was over 4000 years ago
general 2022-10-26 18:32:16 And actually that was my father, God
general 2022-10-26 18:37:43 It would be awkward because if we did we'd probably not know what to do
general 2022-10-26 18:38:00 Also bruh
general 2022-10-26 18:38:15 I can't find anything on google about the area under a displacement acceleration graph
general 2022-10-26 18:40:19 Fair
general 2022-10-26 18:41:49 21
general 2022-10-26 18:44:10 Okay the area under this is v^2 / 2 that's cool
general 2022-10-26 18:44:27 But that's using 1/2ab
general 2022-10-26 18:44:30 That's linear
general 2022-10-26 18:44:32 This is non linear
general 2022-10-26 18:45:45 The real question
general 2022-10-26 18:45:49 When is rickje voice reveal
general 2022-10-26 18:51:03 Hi Miglife

general 2022-10-26 18:55:27 UH
general 2022-10-26 18:55:42 To find the area under a curve I integrate then I put in the limits right?
general 2022-10-26 18:56:49 How did oyu have the time do that?
general 2022-10-26 18:57:08 I thought sketchheads had a timer
general 2022-10-26 18:57:11 Oh
general 2022-10-26 18:57:27 <@883063424614006878> You should get paint.net

general 2022-10-26 18:58:01 This is traditional as it gets
general 2022-10-26 18:58:23 Fair

general 2022-10-26 19:29:10 Okay okay
general 2022-10-26 19:29:14 It took me a while to get my head around it
general 2022-10-26 19:29:40 But I simplified the equation to f(x) = 4*10^14y^-2 + 9.855
general 2022-10-26 19:29:45 Then integration is easy
general 2022-10-26 19:30:38 I think

general 2022-10-27 13:23:47 Which they are not
general 2022-10-27 13:37:14 nO life!!
general 2022-10-27 13:47:13 Nah I'm trying to do some integration
general 2022-10-27 13:47:43 If anyone knows how to integrate Z(a^2 + 2ax + x^2)^-1 please explain to me because this is very difficult
general 2022-10-27 13:47:59 That's simplified btw. I replaced some numbers with A and Z
general 2022-10-27 13:48:22 That is the equation
general 2022-10-27 13:48:30 I just had to get it into that form before I can integrate
general 2022-10-27 13:49:05 basically
general 2022-10-27 13:49:35 It solves for the acceleration due to gravity at a given height above a body if I put the numbers in
general 2022-10-27 13:49:42 And I've been stuck on this since yesterday evening
general 2022-10-27 13:49:49 Trying to integrate it
general 2022-10-27 13:51:57 In this form it's a little less accurate
general 2022-10-27 13:52:16 More an approximation just because the calculator doesn't really do decimals for 10^13 numbers
general 2022-10-27 13:52:35 So at 0 altitude above the Earth it gives 10 instead of 9.81
general 2022-10-27 13:53:08 10ms^-2 that is
general 2022-10-27 13:53:27 Oh
general 2022-10-27 13:53:35 Wait it actualkly gives 9.85
general 2022-10-27 13:53:46 Not so bad
general 2022-10-27 13:54:10 Physics
general 2022-10-27 14:20:35 Sympto thinks any plane he dies in is just bad

general 2022-10-27 15:30:40 Damn. I know how to solve for X if it gave the expression = blah blah
general 2022-10-27 15:30:46 Other than that I could find the minimum or maximum
general 2022-10-27 15:31:06 As in 2cos3x = 6 or some shit
general 2022-10-27 15:31:42 Seyo you can't accurately draw a sin and cos graph in the middle of an exam
general 2022-10-27 15:32:00 Graphing calculators are banned in exams
general 2022-10-27 15:32:11 Bruh
general 2022-10-27 15:32:15 Stoopid ass country
general 2022-10-27 15:32:37 Here we use calculators. But we aren't allowed to use a calculator that just gives the answers
general 2022-10-27 15:32:46 Because anyone can punch numbers into a calculator
general 2022-10-27 15:32:54 Not everyone can show the method of working out
general 2022-10-27 15:34:29 Is it assuming X is very small
general 2022-10-27 15:35:08 I know it's in radians
general 2022-10-27 15:35:10 But is it small
general 2022-10-27 15:36:11 Yeah you use radians for trigonometry unless the question specifically says it's in degrees
general 2022-10-27 15:37:28 Anyway  <@809781295500099584> I need more information about the question
general 2022-10-27 15:37:59 If it just says find X and shows that
general 2022-10-27 15:38:00 kinda mad ngl
general 2022-10-27 15:38:15 Damn
general 2022-10-27 15:38:20 Okay this will take some time

general 2022-10-27 15:44:24 You didn't need this in year 5 bro wtf
general 2022-10-27 15:44:29 You don't even use a calculator at that age
general 2022-10-27 15:44:43 What?
general 2022-10-27 15:44:47 This only costs 20 quid
general 2022-10-27 15:45:05 Oh

general 2022-10-27 19:27:40 Maybe around 40lb
general 2022-10-27 19:31:15 <@456226577798135808> Wouldn't it be stronger if you did it that way instead of the popsicles being on the side. Because like it is now you have to worry about the sheering load that the glue can take

the-dump 2022-10-27 21:29:19 Before it would load from 3km
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:30:23 I set mine at 300
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:30:33 But you are usiing nose mounted guns so
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:30:40 You can make yours a little higher
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:31:19 Wing mounted is 300 in RB usually I set 250 in sim
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:31:39 Except nose mounted I usually set it at 600 on those
the-dump 2022-10-27 21:31:55 Boring

general 2022-10-27 21:55:19 Mine is actually really good
general 2022-10-27 21:55:35 And? I play even less
general 2022-10-27 21:56:02 I get more hits in sim than you do in rb

general 2022-10-27 22:00:06 Sympto knows that
general 2022-10-27 22:00:16 But he has a fragile ego yk
general 2022-10-27 22:00:31 That's why every plane he dies to is "op" and every plane he dies in is "bad"
general 2022-10-27 22:00:47 Fr
general 2022-10-27 22:00:56 I thought he was being ironic with all the shit at first

general 2022-10-28 00:16:31 If we create fusion that's it yk
general 2022-10-28 00:16:39 Fusion will solve tons and tons of problems
general 2022-10-28 00:17:21 Basically, if fusion is developed and the government isn't corrupt: world peace

general 2022-10-28 11:21:36 wow
general 2022-10-28 11:22:09 Me and an F2G were scissoring and then we collided
general 2022-10-28 11:23:32 Don't turnfight like you would with a merlin spitfire
general 2022-10-28 11:23:41 The Griffons have better roll rate
general 2022-10-28 11:23:46 So you can do rolling scissors more
general 2022-10-28 11:23:54 Don't pure energy fight
general 2022-10-28 11:24:12 But don't pull as many sharp turns unless it's safe
general 2022-10-28 11:24:19 Yeah
general 2022-10-28 11:24:39 The Mk 22 and 24 have insane roll rate for a Spitfire
general 2022-10-28 11:24:49 Mk 18 I would just skip that unless you wanna ground pound
general 2022-10-28 11:25:23 Mk 14 is the first griffon
general 2022-10-28 11:25:26 Mk 18 is the 2nd one
general 2022-10-28 11:25:48 It's basically a heavier Mk 14 but it can carry more bombs
general 2022-10-28 11:26:05 Alright

general 2022-10-28 17:52:20 Hi seyo
general 2022-10-28 18:12:47 Reduced to atoms
general 2022-10-28 18:22:08 wow
general 2022-10-28 18:27:01 That is the formula for change in gravitational force across a distance btw
general 2022-10-28 18:27:14 Because it has the integration
general 2022-10-28 18:27:22 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OufORjMiXIY
general 2022-10-28 18:27:25 Here is a cool video about it
general 2022-10-28 18:27:27 That I watched earlier
general 2022-10-28 18:28:15 Not specifically blackholes
general 2022-10-28 18:28:22 It is the same for any 2 bodies
general 2022-10-28 18:28:55 That equation is what I was trying to integrate somewhat
general 2022-10-28 18:29:00 But in relation to acceleration
general 2022-10-28 18:29:02 Rather than force
general 2022-10-28 18:30:11 Well I'm doing physics atm at college so yeah
general 2022-10-28 18:30:14 And I say college
general 2022-10-28 18:30:15 Not uni
general 2022-10-28 18:30:18 Uni comes next year
general 2022-10-28 18:30:48 The section we just did was mechanics
general 2022-10-28 18:30:58 Cheers
general 2022-10-28 18:31:02 MAN
general 2022-10-28 18:31:16 You know I lost a question in an exam
general 2022-10-28 18:32:23 In a frictionless environment where all momentum is conserved
general 2022-10-28 18:32:45 If an object falls a quarter of a metre straight down
general 2022-10-28 18:33:09 It will have the same total energy as if it had fallen the same height at an angle
general 2022-10-28 18:33:10 Right
general 2022-10-28 18:33:26 So on a question it was asking about a roller coaster yadayadaya and we had to find out the height
general 2022-10-28 18:33:52 Easy enough. But she wanted us to use potential energies and shit
general 2022-10-28 18:34:08 How the hell was I meant to know you didn't like my type of answer BRUHH!?
general 2022-10-28 18:34:31 For the record, the question didn't say use a specific way
general 2022-10-28 18:35:01 And I did get the answer wrong because I over thought at the very end. But I went back and did it again yk in my own time. Literally the only change was not adding a 1 which I had done in my original one
general 2022-10-28 18:35:10 Both methods work anyway
general 2022-10-28 18:36:47 Cheap
general 2022-10-28 18:36:52 Here it's 9000 quid a year
general 2022-10-28 18:37:16 Which is about 10.4k dollars a year
general 2022-10-28 18:37:26 At the current conversion ratio
general 2022-10-28 18:38:57 <@315262125113081856> guess what
general 2022-10-28 18:41:50 If only you would correct your bio
general 2022-10-28 18:42:16 Not just "my friend" . It's "a friend"
general 2022-10-28 18:42:48 Clearly, you don't speak English
general 2022-10-28 18:43:11 "My friend" is grammatically correct
general 2022-10-28 18:44:02 I know and I'm not saying it isn't
general 2022-10-28 18:44:18 But we both know that "a friend" is used for more than just someone who is your friend
general 2022-10-28 18:44:39 You're the sus one here
general 2022-10-28 18:44:41 Not me

general 2022-10-30 22:26:10 Only in Britain haha
general 2022-10-30 22:27:04 This shit makes me very proud of Britain
general 2022-10-30 22:27:11 We do have some very cool inventors that's for sure
general 2022-10-30 22:28:20 Goofy ahh take
general 2022-10-30 22:29:25 I must say
general 2022-10-30 22:29:53 People really over estimate the ability to shoot a human sized target going 30kmh
general 2022-10-30 22:30:05 That shit is hard
general 2022-10-30 22:30:49 Just read the comments on the video you'll see all the stupid takes from people who know jack shit
general 2022-10-30 22:32:05 That's a legitimate thing. During WWII people would set up wires like these
general 2022-10-30 22:32:11 And it would kill anyone riding a motorbike

general 2022-10-30 22:37:46 But I'm willing to call out smol brain moments
general 2022-10-30 22:38:53 Poor kid
general 2022-10-30 22:39:06 He will forever be immortalised as a fat child on the PCC discord
general 2022-10-30 22:41:20 I put wine in my dinner

general 2022-10-30 22:48:21 Here in the UK you get charged if you are drinking outside at all ages. Your parents or pub get charged if you are drinking while underage if you are not eating a meal with your drink or of course using a false ID
general 2022-10-30 22:48:33 In your home you can drink at any age as long as your parents are there
general 2022-10-30 22:49:07 Yeah here it depends as well
general 2022-10-30 22:49:12 I think it's more the
general 2022-10-30 22:49:15 level that you are drinking
general 2022-10-30 22:50:45 The police here tend to not arrest the homeless unless they get violent
general 2022-10-30 22:50:51 But there are vagrancy laws here

general 2022-10-31 19:55:47 Wildcats are so cool
general 2022-10-31 19:56:10 They are relatively rare to see flying about as well so it's good when I get to see one

general 2022-10-31 19:58:50 Where
general 2022-10-31 19:58:59 How did you even find a military helicopter on flight radar
general 2022-10-31 19:59:09 Normally they fly below radar level and they keep their transponders off
general 2022-10-31 19:59:51 For fixed wings yeah
general 2022-10-31 20:00:00 But military helicopters I can never see them on FLight radar
general 2022-10-31 20:00:06 I check them when they fly overhead and stuff
general 2022-10-31 20:01:03 Actually they are probably on
general 2022-10-31 20:01:08 But not on for everyone else
general 2022-10-31 20:01:13 If it can work that way
general 2022-10-31 20:02:25 The jets are of course always on  Fr24 since they fly high
general 2022-10-31 20:02:31 But the helicopters are below 300 usually

general 2022-10-31 20:12:19 All the interesting aircraft I see irl
general 2022-10-31 20:14:39 Well I saw 2 Hurricanes fly overhead about 2 years ago. Of course there was the 100 year RAF anniversary in 2018. That was absolutely amazing. Seen a lancaster fly about 700 or so metres directly overhead. Man the sound was good. About 3 days ago a Chinook flew 200 to 300 metres directly overhead as well. The sound of that is absolutely intense. It's so damn loud and it makes your body vibrate
general 2022-10-31 20:14:44 I do remember about
general 2022-10-31 20:14:49 10 or so years ago
general 2022-10-31 20:14:57 Just a convoy of 100 helicopters all painted up fancy

general 2022-10-31 23:25:41 Irish people don't sound like that at all
general 2022-10-31 23:25:59 English people sound completely different every 5 miles
general 2022-10-31 23:26:59 Britain contains England, Wales and Scotland so no
general 2022-10-31 23:27:03 Americans aren't English
general 2022-10-31 23:33:58 Celebrating what?
general 2022-10-31 23:35:15 Tonight is rainy
general 2022-10-31 23:35:18 Nice 😊
general 2022-10-31 23:35:47 Cold nights are nice imo
general 2022-10-31 23:36:01 Just being able to get under the bed and stay warm
general 2022-10-31 23:36:03 Good shit
general 2022-10-31 23:36:29 Amber Heard radiator
general 2022-10-31 23:36:47 Ahh
general 2022-10-31 23:36:49 I mean like
general 2022-10-31 23:36:53 under the blankets and shit
general 2022-10-31 23:37:12 Hi Mig
general 2022-10-31 23:37:36 Hi Morfix
general 2022-10-31 23:54:17 No
general 2022-10-31 23:56:12 Yeah true
general 2022-10-31 23:56:23 How can you not escape an A10 with a Hartier
general 2022-10-31 23:56:26 Harrier
general 2022-10-31 23:57:56 <@883063424614006878> Nice AT AT house. Now where is it located I need to find it
general 2022-10-31 23:59:46 forest?
general 2022-11-01 00:00:15 Splendid
general 2022-11-01 00:00:29 I kinda want a house in the forest tbb
general 2022-11-01 00:00:34 It just sounds fun
general 2022-11-01 00:00:54 Okay but I wouldn't let you in
general 2022-11-01 00:01:31 I think he's reffering to the amount of skill it takes for a missile kill compared to gunnery kill
general 2022-11-01 00:02:57 Woah
general 2022-11-01 00:03:33 Yak 38 looks cool tho
general 2022-11-01 00:03:37 Regardless of function
general 2022-11-01 00:04:02 No?
general 2022-11-01 00:04:16 The VTOL system in the Yak 38 and Harrier are different
general 2022-11-01 00:04:59 Harrier wasn't designed as a fighter aircraft really
general 2022-11-01 00:05:06 It was more for ground support
general 2022-11-01 00:05:15 And naval capability
general 2022-11-01 00:05:34 For fighters they had the Hawker Hunter and shit
general 2022-11-01 00:05:37 Lightnings
general 2022-11-01 00:06:15 They were good irl for their role
general 2022-11-01 00:06:20 Intercepting the bears
general 2022-11-01 00:07:04 In War thunder anyway
general 2022-11-01 00:07:49 Welp. Rip the artifacts then
general 2022-11-01 00:08:16 If the Artifacts in the museums were returned to their original countries, the artifacts would be destroyed immediately
general 2022-11-01 00:08:22 And?
general 2022-11-01 00:08:30 It's ours
general 2022-11-01 00:08:33 Cope
general 2022-11-01 00:08:38 Fuck Africa
general 2022-11-01 00:08:47 Cope
general 2022-11-01 00:09:18 Don't give historical items to the Saudis as well
general 2022-11-01 00:09:26 Those losers just buy them and keep it in their homes
general 2022-11-01 00:09:34 We have museums here that you can go to for free
general 2022-11-01 00:09:56 Boer wars were awful
general 2022-11-01 00:10:33 you'd still have to travel if you wanted to see them in Africa you goofy brainlet
general 2022-11-01 00:10:35 besides
general 2022-11-01 00:10:39 If they were returned
general 2022-11-01 00:11:04 That would mean if you wanna study the stuff you'd have to travel to a lot of countries
general 2022-11-01 00:11:08 only adding on to expenses
general 2022-11-01 00:11:30 They would get destroyed or sold off by the corrupt and violent
general 2022-11-01 00:11:59 Why would tanks be returned to their original countries? 💀
general 2022-11-01 00:12:16 We're talking about Mummies and african jewels here
general 2022-11-01 00:13:34 Yeah but when people say they want the stuff returned no one is reffering to WWII military technology
general 2022-11-01 00:13:53 Okay anyway think about jt
general 2022-11-01 00:15:04 Africa is pretty unstable right now, mostly because of corruption. Look at South Africa as well. The poverty there is insane and the crime rate is extremely high
general 2022-11-01 00:15:07 Now
general 2022-11-01 00:15:52 After the Queen died, South Africa asked for the Star of Africa to be returned
general 2022-11-01 00:16:43 Keep in mind, that diamond was gifted to Britain about 150 years ago
general 2022-11-01 00:17:35 So if that was returned now, it's pretty obvious to realise that with South Africas high crime rate, there will be many gangs wanting to get their hands on that
general 2022-11-01 00:18:22 That's the main issue with giving stuff back to countries
general 2022-11-01 00:18:35 AW HELL NO
general 2022-11-01 00:18:45 <@927438201503772682> YOU DIRTY LITTLE SHIT
general 2022-11-01 00:18:54 WHY ARE YOU SENDING THAT HERE
general 2022-11-01 00:19:10 WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THAT SAVED BRO

general 2022-11-01 09:29:06 Attention seeking*
general 2022-11-01 09:29:27 Hi p3rion
general 2022-11-01 09:29:44 Instrument panels
general 2022-11-01 09:29:48 Show
general 2022-11-01 09:31:06 Hi mildis
general 2022-11-01 09:31:18 Ah nice
general 2022-11-01 09:31:22 Ye
general 2022-11-01 09:32:32 Hi Kiiro
general 2022-11-01 09:33:26 I'm just sitting at a desk
general 2022-11-01 09:33:29 Till I cool off
general 2022-11-01 09:33:43 Gets quite hot walking in a heavy coat
general 2022-11-01 09:37:35 Goober
general 2022-11-01 09:38:00 What speed did he have it set to
general 2022-11-01 09:39:49 L
general 2022-11-01 09:39:51 Anyway
general 2022-11-01 09:39:53 Bye bye
general 2022-11-01 10:28:51 Okay that binomial expansion thing I tried again and I got it
general 2022-11-01 10:29:01 I just had to use the other part of the question I did
general 2022-11-01 10:29:22 Binomial expansion
general 2022-11-01 10:30:23 Okay basically
general 2022-11-01 10:30:39 You know how you can do (3x+2)²
general 2022-11-01 10:30:42 That's easy enough
general 2022-11-01 10:31:01 But try doing (3x+2)¹³
general 2022-11-01 10:31:11 It gets very long very quick
general 2022-11-01 10:31:43 So there are the binomial expansion formulas which allow you to do it quickly
general 2022-11-01 10:32:08 You're like 14 you won't even see binomial expansion till you are 16 or something
general 2022-11-01 10:32:39 Don't give up you goober
general 2022-11-01 10:33:31 The question in question <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-11-01 10:33:42 Part A is easy
general 2022-11-01 10:34:03 Part B it is easy but I just haven't done this before so
general 2022-11-01 10:34:08 It took me some time
general 2022-11-01 10:34:28 Well A is -2.8 and B is 1.8
general 2022-11-01 10:34:52 The expansion up to the x² term is 
-1 + 11x + 5x²
general 2022-11-01 10:36:55 I feel like GammaRad is a neo naz
general 2022-11-01 10:37:09 Dude plasters swasti all over his thing
general 2022-11-01 10:38:07 He's a legitimate racist
general 2022-11-01 10:38:12 And likes to put
general 2022-11-01 10:38:27 he puts Forbidden german symbols on all his buiods
general 2022-11-01 10:38:28 builds
general 2022-11-01 10:38:39 Nah he's serious

general 2022-11-01 10:41:12 Bye bye chat
general 2022-11-01 12:15:26 I accidently derrived the kinetic energy formula
general 2022-11-01 12:15:36 I just wanted to see was there another way to do a question
general 2022-11-01 12:15:41 Apparently it's the only way
general 2022-11-01 12:16:57 How did you use 999 motors on a heli
general 2022-11-01 12:39:35 I'm sad
general 2022-11-01 12:39:42 I had a banana in my bag that I was gonna eat
general 2022-11-01 12:39:50 But it got squashed :(
general 2022-11-01 12:40:01 Leaked all over the place 😭
general 2022-11-01 12:46:14 No
general 2022-11-01 12:47:25 because I keep the food in the section with the least weight
general 2022-11-01 12:47:31 Normally it works
general 2022-11-01 12:50:07 I wonder how many equations can be related at once

general 2022-11-01 18:29:30 <@615356321340063784> They took your wisdom teeth?
general 2022-11-01 18:29:31 Noob
general 2022-11-01 18:29:37 I have more teeth than you
general 2022-11-01 18:30:25 That just means my teeth are wonky
general 2022-11-01 18:30:29 That doesn't mean I have less of them
general 2022-11-01 18:30:56 I fit the stereotype <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-01 18:31:07 But my teeth still function correctly either way
general 2022-11-01 18:31:09 Knife? NAH
general 2022-11-01 18:31:22 I just eat a steak with a fork and I rip chunks off with my mouth
general 2022-11-01 18:31:38 I'm so good at it I don't actually know how to use a knife and fork
general 2022-11-01 18:31:45 Not even joking
general 2022-11-01 18:32:10 I just use my teeth or I use my fork to cut the food
general 2022-11-01 18:33:38 No
general 2022-11-01 18:33:54 I just cut my food with a fork if I need to
general 2022-11-01 18:34:27 Like what?
general 2022-11-01 18:34:38 If I can't bite into it then why would I be eating it
general 2022-11-01 18:35:20 I don't eat cake
general 2022-11-01 18:35:35 And also birthday cakes are a different story
general 2022-11-01 18:35:54 Cutting to create portions is different to me cutting the food that is on my own plate
general 2022-11-01 18:35:59 Not a lie
general 2022-11-01 18:36:09 No
general 2022-11-01 18:36:20 Last time I ate a cake was about 5 years ago

general 2022-11-02 07:30:28 Why?
general 2022-11-02 07:30:59 Yeah but that's vandalism
general 2022-11-02 07:32:05 In terms of vandalism the most I've done is write poop on a street sign with a permanent marker
general 2022-11-02 07:33:10 I did that but the pen could just rub off
general 2022-11-02 07:33:21 So it's not a big deal
general 2022-11-02 07:35:37 Well first what are you trying to do?
general 2022-11-02 07:36:13 A fountain pen... literally the type of pen used for the last couple hundred years
general 2022-11-02 07:36:35 All pens need gravity
general 2022-11-02 07:36:44 Except felt tip pens I believe
general 2022-11-02 07:36:51 They probably use capillary action
general 2022-11-02 07:37:58 Oh. Do you just want it to be on the screen and stay there or do you want it to do stuff?
general 2022-11-02 07:38:10 Yeah to which
general 2022-11-02 07:38:11 Oh
general 2022-11-02 07:38:30 https://mrlennyn.github.io/canvas/canvas.html Just use this

general 2022-11-02 07:39:15 Like it will say S.D in the drawing thing
But in Stormworks you replace that with Screen.Draw

general 2022-11-02 17:37:51 FR
general 2022-11-02 17:37:57 a half is 0.5
general 2022-11-02 17:38:45 That was my initial thought but I thought about it for a second and realised it's not that
general 2022-11-02 17:39:13 Because when you hear half you automatically think x/2
general 2022-11-02 17:39:15 It's just natural
general 2022-11-02 17:39:42 Also
general 2022-11-02 17:39:45 FR
general 2022-11-02 17:39:46 Also
general 2022-11-02 17:39:49 Can I just say
general 2022-11-02 17:39:55 Why the fuck is it A, B, c, d

general 2022-11-02 17:42:10 I have a bottle of WD40 on top of my fridge
general 2022-11-02 17:42:21 Nah I got my own
general 2022-11-02 17:45:10 Do not forget we have Vine
general 2022-11-02 17:45:18 Had
general 2022-11-02 17:45:33 I said had
general 2022-11-02 17:45:40 Anyway
general 2022-11-02 17:45:52 Some gold ass shit came out of Vine and some gold ass shit comes out of Tik Tok
general 2022-11-02 17:46:06 Don't dismiss the actually funny shit off just because the platform itself is cringe
general 2022-11-02 17:46:32 So many grapes 🥺
general 2022-11-02 17:46:37 <@883063424614006878>
general 2022-11-02 17:51:02 I was kinda wondering if she was gonna say "I'm a guy btw" at the end
general 2022-11-02 17:56:07 Did this happen to you?
general 2022-11-02 17:58:44 Game still hasn't given me that
general 2022-11-02 18:13:49 gay
general 2022-11-02 18:20:15 She stupid af
general 2022-11-02 18:21:40 It's free real estate
general 2022-11-02 18:22:12 If they didn't want to be colonised why didn't they fight back
general 2022-11-02 18:22:14 Silly goobers
general 2022-11-02 18:24:20 Their rocks are no match for my 15 gram lead ball travelling at 600 metres per second pointed at their left ventricle
general 2022-11-02 18:25:09 Who said that?
general 2022-11-02 18:25:12 And what is a mock trial
general 2022-11-02 18:25:26 Ah
general 2022-11-02 18:29:16 Your honour, I merely defended her from her violent purse. To call it "attempted murder" and "robbery" is slander. If I hadn't taken that purse after it mysteriously stabbed her 23 times she might not have lived
general 2022-11-02 18:33:07 <@398216801592410113>
general 2022-11-02 18:33:44 Chicken butt
general 2022-11-02 19:14:29 Hi Mig
general 2022-11-02 19:15:10 Qauiler would not be as cool as Mig
general 2022-11-02 19:15:15 Quaileer
general 2022-11-02 19:15:25 <@398216801592410113> Ping
general 2022-11-02 19:15:48 Ya I saw
general 2022-11-02 19:18:11 What the fuck is L and the thing below it
general 2022-11-02 19:18:47 No
general 2022-11-02 19:18:50 Bruh
general 2022-11-02 19:19:00 Why would you set targetting to 800 metres unless you are shooting at ground targets?
general 2022-11-02 19:19:36 300 metres for wing mounted
general 2022-11-02 19:19:39 600 max for nose
general 2022-11-02 19:19:56 I don't use vertical targeting either
general 2022-11-02 19:20:18 Vertical targeting just makes displacement shooting harder
general 2022-11-02 19:20:50 Besides
general 2022-11-02 19:20:58 I have played enough I can vertically target by eye
general 2022-11-02 19:21:13 I'm pretty good up to about 1.5km
general 2022-11-02 19:21:26 Yes
general 2022-11-02 19:22:00 But remember, your target will have moved forward assuming it is flying away from you
general 2022-11-02 19:22:29 So you have to shoot up for the distance, but you have to point up even more for the shell to land at the location the target *will* be at
general 2022-11-02 19:23:08 Easy way to lose all your energy and die
general 2022-11-02 19:23:28 Wait are you doing this when they are on your tail?
general 2022-11-02 19:24:19 I know how to perform a vertical spin stall thingy
general 2022-11-02 19:24:37 Apply right/left rudder and then pull hard back on the stick in the opposite direction
general 2022-11-02 19:24:47 Will send you from 500kmh to stalling in about half a second
general 2022-11-02 19:25:57 If you do it correctly you should be able to then return the stick to centre and apply opposite rudder to what you originally inputted. That way you will level the plane back out again to exit the stall almost immediately
general 2022-11-02 19:26:16 Ya
general 2022-11-02 19:26:20 Doesn't work for all planes tho
general 2022-11-02 19:26:24 The ones I've tested it on
general 2022-11-02 19:27:16 It works on all the 109s. Works on the Yak fighter series. Doesn't work on Merlin spitfires but it works on the Mk 22 and 24.
general 2022-11-02 19:28:08 You don't need to worry about roll rate
general 2022-11-02 19:28:11 It basically causes a snap roll
general 2022-11-02 19:30:04 It's good enough tho
general 2022-11-02 19:30:19 Good enough to snap roll anyway
general 2022-11-02 19:30:27 But
general 2022-11-02 19:30:28 vertical
general 2022-11-02 19:30:49 Yeah
general 2022-11-02 19:30:59 Just do a vertical snap roll and you will be on the enemies tail
general 2022-11-02 19:31:05 Or they will play it smart and climb
general 2022-11-02 19:31:59 Afk
general 2022-11-02 19:32:02 Gonna restart internet
general 2022-11-02 19:44:59 My younger brother
general 2022-11-02 19:45:04 has made the claim that he can do
general 2022-11-02 19:45:07 400 calf raises
general 2022-11-02 19:45:28 Absolutely outrageous lol
general 2022-11-02 19:45:40 Oh he'd be pissed about that
general 2022-11-02 19:45:50 He get's stupidly competitive for no reason
general 2022-11-02 19:46:09 nah he's a weirdo
general 2022-11-02 19:46:13 I don't want him associated with me
general 2022-11-02 19:46:33 On god
general 2022-11-02 19:46:41 Anyway
general 2022-11-02 19:46:44 I literally walk on my toes
general 2022-11-02 19:46:55 And calf raises are still not easy af
general 2022-11-02 19:47:26 I'll have to write a novel to list that off
general 2022-11-02 19:47:40 He can probably do 5 or something
general 2022-11-02 19:47:42 but to be fair
general 2022-11-02 19:47:48 The average American can only do 1 or 2
general 2022-11-02 19:47:59 Pull ups are extremely hard
general 2022-11-02 19:48:09 In the Navy Seals you literally only need to be able to do 15
general 2022-11-02 19:48:27 Nah they are hard even if you are very light
general 2022-11-02 19:48:50 And just so we are clear. I mean this pullup
general 2022-11-02 19:49:10 It's harder
general 2022-11-02 19:49:13 And uses more muscles
general 2022-11-02 19:49:51 I'm pretty sure it's the most difficult compound exercise out there
general 2022-11-02 19:50:04 Wdym
general 2022-11-02 19:50:06 Palm facing you?
general 2022-11-02 19:50:17 That's a chin up
general 2022-11-02 19:50:20 Those are easier
general 2022-11-02 19:59:06 27 days for me
general 2022-11-02 20:02:39 Cat
general 2022-11-02 20:03:38 Oh
general 2022-11-02 20:03:40 Well for me
general 2022-11-02 20:03:47 Chin Ups are dead easy compared to pull ups
general 2022-11-02 20:04:01 Idk
general 2022-11-02 20:04:15 I don't
general 2022-11-02 20:04:55 I'm not a fat woman so I never really had concerns about my weight
general 2022-11-02 20:05:33 I have a tape measure for that
general 2022-11-02 20:05:36 So I'm about 5'10
general 2022-11-02 20:05:43 give or take a little
general 2022-11-02 20:06:16 If I breath deep yeah
general 2022-11-02 20:06:22 The wrong type of breathing that is
general 2022-11-02 20:06:38 Yeah I know I'm not obese lol
general 2022-11-02 20:06:54 I'm not underweight either tho
general 2022-11-02 20:06:57 Barely
general 2022-11-02 20:07:25 People are kinda ridiculous these days with weight tho
general 2022-11-02 20:07:36 People try mock others for having skinny arms and shit
general 2022-11-02 20:07:37 Like what?
general 2022-11-02 20:07:49 That's not underweight
general 2022-11-02 20:08:16 Everyone at school doesn't make you underweight tho
general 2022-11-02 20:09:05 https://tenor.com/view/fat-cat-garfield-tummy-full-tap-belly-gif-15742977
general 2022-11-02 20:10:09 It's probably very difficult for you to gain weight tho
general 2022-11-02 20:10:35 Most of my classmates have a bit of fat around their arms
general 2022-11-02 20:10:45 yk
general 2022-11-02 20:10:45 They aren't overweight but
general 2022-11-02 20:12:16 I'm too poor to afford food to work out
general 2022-11-02 20:12:27 The amount of calories you need to gain while working out is insane
general 2022-11-02 20:12:50 Same here
general 2022-11-02 20:13:05 Well at least we will sell for more haha
general 2022-11-02 20:13:19 For me it's all going to my right arm
general 2022-11-02 20:13:23 I play guitar
general 2022-11-02 20:13:28 And do other things
general 2022-11-02 20:13:42 No
general 2022-11-02 20:13:57 Nope
general 2022-11-02 20:14:19 My real name is Michael Jackson

general 2022-11-02 20:15:45 What
general 2022-11-02 20:15:53 It doesn't rhyme at all
general 2022-11-02 20:15:58 Also
general 2022-11-02 20:16:00 It's funny
general 2022-11-02 20:16:13 I struggle to gain weight considering 75% of my diet is just beef
general 2022-11-02 20:16:41 Not here but
general 2022-11-02 20:16:49 If you look old enough no one will know
general 2022-11-02 20:16:55 Nah I don't eat processed shit
general 2022-11-02 20:17:09 I cook my own food
general 2022-11-02 20:17:21 Fat food doesn't make you fat tho
general 2022-11-02 20:17:30 It's excess sugars that makes you fat
general 2022-11-02 20:18:11 Well it depends on a lot of stuff obviously
general 2022-11-02 20:18:32 If you are physically active to a degree you will use most of that sugar up
general 2022-11-02 20:18:34 Like me
general 2022-11-02 20:18:56 Ain't nothing better than power walking to school everyday 💀
general 2022-11-02 20:19:37 Generally I don't pay attention to sport but I think cricket and baseball are pretty cool
general 2022-11-02 20:19:58 I don't like football
general 2022-11-02 20:20:19 The one where you actually hit the ball with your foot

general 2022-11-03 07:29:30 ECU's won't make your engine cool better
general 2022-11-03 07:29:47 What makes your engine cool better is high flowrate and 5x5 electric fan radiators

creations-chat 2022-11-03 14:27:32 I'm going to leak you. Prepare your organs morfix. You will be turned into jelly and then sent down through an old pipe. At the end of which will be an unmarked, blue, oil drum. Once the drum has been entirely filled, it will be sealed shut. From then it will be transported 12 miles to the nearest airport where it will be loaded onto an unknown passenger aircraft headed for mainland USA. While the aircraft is nearing Chicago, the flight engineer, who I have bribed, will open the drum. The liquid you will then be connected to a series of pipes and dispersed over the city. What you didn't know is that I laced you with 17000 grams of napalm. Upon contact with the ground, the sudden compression will ignite it, and thus, setting the city aflame. Your family will not be paid compensation for the loss but you will recieve a 25 dollar Amazon gift card if you so desire
general 2022-11-03 14:34:56 In this situation the guy flew into a power line
general 2022-11-03 14:35:03 it wasn't even in Ukraine
general 2022-11-03 14:37:55 What
general 2022-11-03 14:38:03 The A10 saw loads of action during the gulf war
general 2022-11-03 14:38:31 Dm
general 2022-11-03 14:39:56 The engine isn't on fire
general 2022-11-03 14:40:14 It's just shuttinf down because he ejected
general 2022-11-03 14:40:26 And look at the jet itself
general 2022-11-03 14:40:33 The tail is cut clean off
general 2022-11-03 14:40:41 But there is no other damage to it
general 2022-11-03 14:40:58 If a missile had hit the back it would be covered in shrapnel damage
general 2022-11-03 14:41:37 It's hard to see power lines irl
general 2022-11-03 14:41:41 Harder to see them on video
general 2022-11-03 14:41:59 I believe he hit them just before the clip started tho
general 2022-11-03 14:42:04 Since his plane was wobbling
general 2022-11-03 14:42:21 There is a full clip somewhere but I'm not sure where
general 2022-11-03 14:46:21 Okay degenerate
general 2022-11-03 14:47:14 No because that would be faster than the top speed of the Su25
general 2022-11-03 14:47:25 I'm not crying but you're still a degen
general 2022-11-03 14:48:36 At sea level mach 0.84 is 1050kmh roughly, which is 100kmh faster than the Su25 top speed
general 2022-11-03 14:49:30 The speed of sound decrease with altitude so
general 2022-11-03 14:49:43 Mach 1 at sea level is a lot faster than Mach 1 4km up
general 2022-11-03 14:52:01 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-11-03 19:55:38 Bombing civilians was the norm during WW2
general 2022-11-03 19:55:45 The Axis did it, the Allies did it

general 2022-11-03 19:56:24 You wanna talk about Japanese war crimes?
general 2022-11-03 19:56:33 Oh but I bet they don't tell you about that in School
general 2022-11-03 19:57:04 The Japanese during WWII were pure scum. Worse than Germany
general 2022-11-03 19:57:31 Their human experimentation shit as well
general 2022-11-03 19:57:43 As awful as the Germans were with that, they had actual medical value behind them
general 2022-11-03 19:57:52 The Japanese experiments were just sadistic torture for fun
general 2022-11-03 19:58:10 I am slaughtering today haha
general 2022-11-03 19:59:14 That's fucking creepy
general 2022-11-03 19:59:19 No documented survivors
general 2022-11-03 19:59:25 Sad
general 2022-11-03 19:59:38 Unit 731 experiments
general 2022-11-03 20:00:06 Yeah that's how you destroy a ship dumbass
general 2022-11-03 20:00:31 Every country did to a degree
general 2022-11-03 20:00:44 But Japan was by far a lot more awful than the USA
general 2022-11-03 20:00:50 No fuck off
general 2022-11-03 20:01:10 If fighting ship to ship will surely result in a loss then that is just further incentive to not fight ship by ship
general 2022-11-03 20:01:53 Your country's "masterpiece"  got destroyed by bombers. Which is the way most major ships were destroyed
general 2022-11-03 20:02:41 That's rich considering your country's entire military was based on flying aircraft into them
general 2022-11-03 20:02:52 Goober ass logic
general 2022-11-03 20:03:33 I'm not from the US
general 2022-11-03 20:03:42 Sucks to be you guys anyway
general 2022-11-03 20:04:12 >rational
>wasting aircraft by flying them into a ship

pick one goober
general 2022-11-03 20:05:02 Not necessarily
general 2022-11-03 20:05:32 Most of the ships after Pearl Harbour were repaired
general 2022-11-03 20:05:46 It was largely an ineffective attack
general 2022-11-03 20:05:59 I think 3 got destroyed
general 2022-11-03 20:06:06 Only 1 of which was a major ship
general 2022-11-03 20:07:27 Obviously not effective enough
general 2022-11-03 20:09:00 Didn't stop the US navy tho
general 2022-11-03 20:09:11 Didn't stop 100 thousand citizens being vaporised either
general 2022-11-03 20:10:05 <@718409831639154718> Did you look at this?
general 2022-11-03 20:10:09 That's what your country did
general 2022-11-03 20:10:17 That wasn't instantaneous death
general 2022-11-03 20:10:23 That was torture and experimentation
general 2022-11-03 20:11:01 And I pray that you get help if you are gonna sit there defending a country that would dissect babies while they were alive
general 2022-11-03 20:11:53 Then why are you bitching about the atomic bombs and your beloved Yamato being destroyed by aircraft
general 2022-11-03 20:12:19 The nukes are more humane than continuous torture to be fair
general 2022-11-03 20:13:07 Literally even after they got nuked twice their top generals cut their own chest open because they didn't want to surrender
general 2022-11-03 20:14:12 Yeah but Hirohito couldn't do it at first because everyone else in power was against it
general 2022-11-03 20:15:21 I just wanna send this here
general 2022-11-03 20:16:03 
general 2022-11-03 20:16:17 
general 2022-11-03 20:16:48 I'm glad Japan today is nowhere near it was back then
general 2022-11-03 20:17:42 I'm talking to you like your an asshole who won't acknowledge the shit his country did because "others were bad"
general 2022-11-03 20:17:50 No one said the Allies didn't commit war crimes
general 2022-11-03 20:19:02 Boxness thinks the only country outside of Japan is America
general 2022-11-03 20:19:15 Well
general 2022-11-03 20:19:25 That's a typical Jap for you. Don't know shit about their own countries history
general 2022-11-03 20:19:55 Not here in the UK I guess
general 2022-11-03 20:20:12 Teachers love telling us about how awful we were
general 2022-11-03 20:20:36 I'm not a war fan
general 2022-11-03 20:20:48 But I don't pretend to not know when a country did something incredibly fucked up

general 2022-11-03 20:28:09 Yes
general 2022-11-03 20:28:15 On up to 400,000 people
general 2022-11-03 20:29:30 Notice how boxness does not even acknowledge any of these
general 2022-11-03 20:29:38 I have posted countless stuff
general 2022-11-03 20:29:44 All of which has been simply ignored by him
general 2022-11-03 20:30:21 Even to just acknowledge it
general 2022-11-03 20:30:56 It's like this guy has a brain chip that just filters out anything negative about Japan
general 2022-11-03 20:31:27 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2022-11-03 20:31:40 Oh so you'll respond to that?
general 2022-11-03 20:31:44 How INTERESTING
general 2022-11-03 20:32:51 It's not fucking guilt tripping. If you were talking about the slave trade and I just started saying "well um actually Libya did it so it's okay" you'd be pissed too
general 2022-11-03 20:33:10 The shit is bad
general 2022-11-03 20:33:19 You shut up
general 2022-11-03 20:33:39 God you're just scum Boxness
general 2022-11-03 20:34:17 I'm not talking to you like you did it. But you are pretending it doesn't exist
general 2022-11-03 20:34:37 Wdym explain how
general 2022-11-03 20:34:44 Scroll up idiot
general 2022-11-03 20:36:20 Not because he didn't specifically acknowledge it alone. If I was talking before about it and he wasn't responding it before whatever. But it's because this asshole started going off about how much he condemns Yamato being destroyed and complaining that the US is terrible and at fault (in response)
general 2022-11-03 20:36:42 A kilogram of feathers
general 2022-11-03 20:38:09 I'm not. I said it was more humane than torture
general 2022-11-03 20:39:19 I never said *is* humane

general 2022-11-05 00:07:59 I feel like this person isn't an unde tbh
general 2022-11-05 00:09:18 Given that "unlogic" was used instead of illogical and the more motonous text it's probably just someone speaking broken English
general 2022-11-05 00:10:50 No that's a continent

general 2022-11-05 00:40:58 It would be okay in VR
general 2022-11-05 01:00:53 Never
general 2022-11-05 01:04:33 Sometimes I feel like a bear. Not because of being strong or being covered in thousands and thousands of hairs

general 2022-11-05 13:06:58 Splendid
general 2022-11-05 13:08:52 Rickje told everyone
general 2022-11-05 13:09:08 He had some issues with real life that
general 2022-11-05 13:09:10 He has to deal with
general 2022-11-05 13:10:20 You'll still see him online on discord occasionally but he just doesn't even talk anymore
general 2022-11-05 13:10:41 The whole thing is very sad
general 2022-11-05 13:14:08 He is the only dev
general 2022-11-05 13:15:45 He didn't. That was just a rumor started by some members
general 2022-11-05 13:15:58 Oh
general 2022-11-05 13:19:24 Got some angles going
general 2022-11-05 13:19:26 No engines built for this yet
general 2022-11-05 13:19:39 But I wanna make a radial engine
general 2022-11-05 13:20:16 On/Off composite write
general 2022-11-05 13:20:20 In the MC editor
general 2022-11-05 13:21:10 Are you trying to use 2 separate on offs to do different things?
general 2022-11-05 13:21:12 Or justcontrol 1 thing
general 2022-11-05 13:21:21 Oh
general 2022-11-05 13:22:12 Make it like that
general 2022-11-05 13:23:05 Also why not just connect like that?
general 2022-11-05 13:23:14 If you will have 2 buttons anyway
general 2022-11-05 13:23:35 A sliding connector track?
general 2022-11-05 13:23:41 Ahh
general 2022-11-05 13:23:45 Yeah okay I see now
general 2022-11-05 13:24:02 Make the 2nd one channel 2 I think
general 2022-11-05 13:24:09 Because I think up and down are on different channels
general 2022-11-05 13:24:40 Electric cable anchor
general 2022-11-05 13:24:51 You'll have to use that to transfer the signal as well
general 2022-11-05 13:25:33 Yes
general 2022-11-05 13:25:43 you can use that
general 2022-11-05 13:25:48 But the cable can go distances
general 2022-11-05 13:25:55 Ye
general 2022-11-05 13:26:24 Yes
general 2022-11-05 13:27:31 That is how you setup composite for the cable
general 2022-11-05 13:27:41 You just connect that ouput to the cable
general 2022-11-05 13:27:52 and then connect the other cable anchor to the motor
general 2022-11-05 13:27:53 winc
general 2022-11-05 13:27:55 winch
general 2022-11-05 13:29:12 
general 2022-11-05 13:29:21 No no
general 2022-11-05 13:29:27 Don't connect the cable anchors together
general 2022-11-05 13:29:33 The electric cable does that
general 2022-11-05 13:29:48 The data will go through the cable
general 2022-11-05 13:29:56 blue is cable
general 2022-11-05 13:30:07 Yes
general 2022-11-05 13:30:23 Then connect your other cable anchor to the winch
general 2022-11-05 13:31:12 You can connect the power from the electrical cable anchor ofc so don't put batteries next to the winch
general 2022-11-05 13:31:20 You just need it on the main part of your vehicle
general 2022-11-05 13:33:40 Check your composite channels
general 2022-11-05 13:33:49 Cuz sometimes it's not clear what goes to what
general 2022-11-05 13:34:01 Just fiddle with them Ig
general 2022-11-05 13:36:35 Oh
general 2022-11-05 13:36:38 Make the 2nd one channel 2
general 2022-11-05 13:36:40 Not channel 1
general 2022-11-05 13:36:41 try that
general 2022-11-05 13:40:38 Bruh
general 2022-11-05 13:59:46 Medium Engine moment
general 2022-11-05 14:00:20 OH
general 2022-11-05 14:00:24 Okay that is quite a whie
general 2022-11-05 14:04:55 I removed the other pilot seat
general 2022-11-05 14:04:57 Well flight engineer I guess
general 2022-11-05 14:05:10 Just gonna have the pilot do the stuff
general 2022-11-05 14:05:28 I wish this light would work tho
general 2022-11-05 14:05:32 It won't go to the correct colour
general 2022-11-05 14:08:27 Hi Mildis
general 2022-11-05 14:11:26 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY27ueKNbfI This is cool as hell

general 2022-11-05 14:23:46 That's terrible tf you mean
general 2022-11-05 14:23:58 Even a light tap can be enough to make you sick
general 2022-11-05 14:24:16 USED TO IT
general 2022-11-05 14:24:21 WHAT
general 2022-11-05 14:24:26 HOW THE HELL ARE YOU USED TO IT
general 2022-11-05 14:24:52 dyno slow
general 2022-11-05 14:25:26 You either lying or you got no balls
general 2022-11-05 14:25:29 Fr
general 2022-11-05 14:25:31 Yeah
general 2022-11-05 14:26:28 Also turn this stuff of
general 2022-11-05 14:26:29 off
general 2022-11-05 14:29:27 What
general 2022-11-05 14:29:42 Is that peanut butter?
the-dump 2022-11-05 14:31:09 AHHH WHAT SONG IS THIS FROM AGAIN
the-dump 2022-11-05 14:33:21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLchXp8FCbI there we go
general 2022-11-05 14:34:18 It won't kill you
general 2022-11-05 14:34:23 but you will lose a ball if it goes untreated
general 2022-11-05 14:35:07 Wdym
general 2022-11-05 14:35:14 Without balls we would not have anyone on this planet
general 2022-11-05 14:49:52 So smol
general 2022-11-05 14:50:53 2 engines or 4 engines?
general 2022-11-05 14:57:21 Fuel tank
general 2022-11-05 14:58:14 Yes
general 2022-11-05 14:58:27 Lmao
general 2022-11-05 15:00:01 Wedges increase the amount of fuel it holds
general 2022-11-05 15:00:06 Compared to just blocks
general 2022-11-05 15:00:07 Like
general 2022-11-05 15:00:16 You can double or triple the fuel volume
general 2022-11-05 15:00:28 Which makes logical sense ofc, wedges take up less volume
general 2022-11-05 15:01:53 wow
general 2022-11-05 15:01:59 3726 litre tank
general 2022-11-05 15:02:02 Per wing
general 2022-11-05 15:02:09 Never
general 2022-11-05 15:03:21 Rip
general 2022-11-05 15:04:52 I think I should make the engines extend out at least 1 or 2 blocsk
general 2022-11-05 15:05:04 Little short atm
general 2022-11-05 15:05:12 They feel rather smol
general 2022-11-05 15:06:42 Okay do I make this a flat engine or radial
general 2022-11-05 15:06:48 I wanna do flat but they take up a lot of space
general 2022-11-05 15:07:00 Well
general 2022-11-05 15:07:06 I suppose it is going to fit inside my wing anyway
general 2022-11-05 15:08:24 I'll need to remove these
general 2022-11-05 15:08:25 to make space for the forward landing gear
general 2022-11-05 15:31:26 Higher centre of mass compared to a 109
general 2022-11-05 15:31:49 And the taller landing gear
general 2022-11-05 15:31:53 It basically acts as a large lever
general 2022-11-05 15:32:19 You can even flip a Wellington if you brake too hard at lower speed
general 2022-11-05 15:33:25 But it also has a wing at the top
general 2022-11-05 15:33:48 That will keep it more balanced in terms of the forces
general 2022-11-05 15:33:50 acting on it
general 2022-11-05 15:33:53 Even at lower speed
general 2022-11-05 15:34:13 Probably can't brake as hard too since it's an ancient aircraft
general 2022-11-05 15:39:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL__Z5ZA-Zw
general 2022-11-05 15:40:31 Can you make a radar guided missile in plane crazy?
general 2022-11-05 15:50:07 I like how they specifically have fireworks there
general 2022-11-05 15:52:22 
general 2022-11-05 15:52:27 The hell do they think the group payout system is for

general 2022-11-05 21:11:14 Hey at least I don't deny that the torture killing of 400k people happened
general 2022-11-05 21:14:06 You can scroll up to all those messages then

general 2022-11-05 21:15:28 Japan doesn't mention acknowledge it's war crimes
general 2022-11-05 21:15:37 And doesn't even teach it
general 2022-11-05 21:15:39 That is a form of denial
general 2022-11-05 21:15:55 Now for you to do the same
general 2022-11-05 21:16:16 And then keep on "condemning" the sinking of Yamato (a military target)
general 2022-11-05 21:16:21 You are a denier
general 2022-11-05 21:16:45 You won't even call it war crimes <@718409831639154718>

general 2022-11-05 21:18:25 Basically fyi boxnesz is a war crime denier
general 2022-11-05 21:18:33 So do you condemn the actions of Unit 731?

general 2022-11-05 21:22:48 But you'll bring up specific events that the US did
general 2022-11-05 21:23:12 I never denied the US War crimes. What they did was terrible. But you are denying what Japan did

general 2022-11-06 23:18:22 Alchohol doesn't kill instantly unless you drink a fuck load in a few hours

general 2022-11-06 23:18:38 And liver ofc
general 2022-11-06 23:18:43 Liver disease is a big one

general 2022-11-06 23:19:24 Man is straight up just lying at this point now
general 2022-11-06 23:20:00 .
general 2022-11-06 23:20:22 Fucked up means fucked up dude
general 2022-11-06 23:20:54 Because you told us that you are fucked up because of it
general 2022-11-06 23:21:06 Which means you are taking a lot of alchohol intake
general 2022-11-06 23:21:16 Okay sure bud

general 2022-11-06 23:29:33 Fair
general 2022-11-06 23:29:48 I do not like a spinning propeller above the head
general 2022-11-06 23:30:19 Yeah but they are horizontal rotors not vertical
general 2022-11-06 23:30:32 If they detach they aren't gonna sever my neck
general 2022-11-06 23:30:58 You seen the pictures of aircraft propellers that came off and just chainsawed through the plane?
general 2022-11-06 23:32:28 How about just don't do either
general 2022-11-06 23:34:38 So why do you do both of them
general 2022-11-06 23:35:28 Well then go ahead. Smoke and drink as much as you want, may as well OD at that point
general 2022-11-06 23:36:40 You can drink 1 glass of alchohol and you'll be fine, won't really have any effects
general 2022-11-06 23:36:53 You can smoke 1 joint, you'll definitely feel it
general 2022-11-06 23:37:45 Okay hard liquor is a bit different lol
general 2022-11-06 23:37:50 that shit will make you die
general 2022-11-06 23:38:07 Drink an entire bottle of 70% alchohol vodka in one go <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-06 23:38:59 It's like trying to wash something with dog shit
general 2022-11-06 23:39:08 just doesn't work
general 2022-11-06 23:39:21 Gee I wonder why
general 2022-11-06 23:40:00 I put wine in my food but the alcohol boils away. I've never been drunk
general 2022-11-06 23:40:18 How old are you?
general 2022-11-06 23:40:37 10ml of methanol mm mmm mmk
general 2022-11-06 23:41:13 Okay. I will tell everyone
general 2022-11-06 23:42:00 Too bad
general 2022-11-06 23:42:32 I have another
general 2022-11-06 23:42:51 Okay junkie
general 2022-11-06 23:43:25 You aren't? <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-06 23:43:52 My optical nerves are irreversiblly damaged from methanol!!😊<:methm:973333191756742707> <:methm:973333191756742707>
general 2022-11-06 23:44:15 Lead acid batteries delicious
general 2022-11-06 23:45:07 For anyones information
general 2022-11-06 23:45:14 About 15ml of methanol is lethal
general 2022-11-06 23:45:44 But don't drink it
general 2022-11-06 23:46:04 Yes
general 2022-11-06 23:46:22 Obviously not
general 2022-11-06 23:46:33 No you didn't
general 2022-11-06 23:47:33 
general 2022-11-06 23:47:48 Wine is ethanol you goober
general 2022-11-06 23:48:01 Ah mb
general 2022-11-06 23:48:32 It deletes your optical nerve
general 2022-11-06 23:48:35 Goofy
general 2022-11-06 23:49:00 People who try to make their own ethanol but do it incorrectly
general 2022-11-06 23:49:25 Americans usually
general 2022-11-06 23:49:40 You can make alchohol from potatoes
general 2022-11-06 23:50:11 I'm doing chemistry in school atm I could probably make my own alchohol by the end of 2023. I wouln't drink it tho
general 2022-11-06 23:50:43 I'll make methanol instead and sell it to him
general 2022-11-06 23:51:09 Methyblue
general 2022-11-06 23:51:43 What the alcoholic won't realise is methanol is less dense than ethanol (silly goober drank all 85cl)
general 2022-11-06 23:52:31 Actually methanol is more dense than ethanol according to google
general 2022-11-06 23:52:36 That's interesting
general 2022-11-06 23:52:45 I suppose that would make sense
general 2022-11-06 23:53:07 It is a smaller molecule so a lot more can probably fit in the same amount of volume
general 2022-11-06 23:54:46 I mean that won't do anything
general 2022-11-06 23:54:55 Gasoline and diesel don't react together
general 2022-11-06 23:57:26 Stop asking everyone this to justify your own addictions
general 2022-11-06 23:58:41 That shit sucks
general 2022-11-06 23:58:44 It's annoying
general 2022-11-06 23:59:51 I showered about an hour and a half agk
general 2022-11-06 23:59:52 ago
general 2022-11-07 00:00:05 Hair still wet but it's night not so bad
general 2022-11-07 00:00:25 Yeah. The lack of movement can cause deep vein thrombosis
general 2022-11-07 00:00:45 And if that clot breaks free
general 2022-11-07 00:00:54 Oops!!! heart embolism
general 2022-11-07 00:01:08 Hi Mig
general 2022-11-07 00:01:44 An embolism isn't because of an issue with the organ itself
general 2022-11-07 00:01:50 Usually a different factor causes it
general 2022-11-07 00:02:13 Pulmonary embolisms like to occur at high altitude ofc because of the lower pressure
general 2022-11-07 00:03:05 He's not healthy. He is a junkie
general 2022-11-07 00:03:35 infinite kidney stones

general 2022-11-07 00:06:21 assuming your stomach had a 14 litre capacity
general 2022-11-07 00:07:57 I HAVE A FOOT CRAMP
general 2022-11-07 00:08:00 One moment
general 2022-11-07 00:08:07 I need water
general 2022-11-07 00:15:25 Okay I'm back
general 2022-11-07 00:15:32 That is the longest cramp I've ever had
general 2022-11-07 00:15:49 Didn't help that I was lying in bed initially so when I got up my blood pressure was low
general 2022-11-07 00:16:36 No but surprisingly (even to myself) I know quite a bit of stuff
general 2022-11-07 00:17:02 This is what years of reading up about shit on the internet does to you. You learn something 8 years ago and it stays in their somehow
general 2022-11-07 00:18:25 Hi Mig
general 2022-11-07 00:19:37 Goober expects us to believe people went and stole that
general 2022-11-07 00:20:29 Goodnight
general 2022-11-07 00:20:54 So he can go to sleep?
general 2022-11-07 00:22:03 I should probably go sleep now too tbh. I got a small test tommorow and I don't feel so ready for it. Every little bit of revision helps, even last minute revision
general 2022-11-07 00:22:39 You're a junkie.  I'm automatically superior to you by default
general 2022-11-07 00:23:16 Why's that?
general 2022-11-07 00:26:09 Based? Yeah, not doing drugs is hella based
general 2022-11-07 00:26:13 Stay clean bros
general 2022-11-07 00:26:38 One thing I can value about Islam is their views on drugs
general 2022-11-07 00:28:28 Bless your soul my guy
general 2022-11-07 00:30:20 No no no this cramp might come back
general 2022-11-07 00:30:25 Hurting a little bit again
general 2022-11-07 00:31:27 You know how to punch?

general 2022-11-07 01:19:42 Good luck getting any good opportunities while failing drug tests left and right
general 2022-11-07 01:21:16 Legallity doesn't mean that it is safe or appropriate for you to have drugs in your system while at work place
general 2022-11-07 01:21:52 He's a junkie yeah

general 2022-11-07 16:59:53 Floats are less stealthy, add drag and weight to the aircraft (which affects performance). Not to mention, aircraft carriers carry A LOT of fuel. Floats don't They only carry urine. In summary, floats should be reserved for the C130 hercules only as it requires less fuel than the F35 and is a lighter aircraft. Not to mention, the C130 is propelled by 2 anti gravity engines which the F35 doesn't (only has a hyperdrive, gay)

general 2022-11-07 23:39:00 Also it's more than 1 minute I think
general 2022-11-07 23:39:04 Like 2 minutes
general 2022-11-07 23:39:17 1.4 minutes is enough
general 2022-11-07 23:39:26 accelerate to 7km high in 20 seconds

general 2022-11-08 13:03:35 Wow
general 2022-11-08 13:04:30 Hi Mig
general 2022-11-08 13:04:35 Somewhat
general 2022-11-08 13:04:41 I can make a steam engine
general 2022-11-08 13:04:45 I've done like 3 of them
general 2022-11-08 13:04:57 Wdym limiter stuff
general 2022-11-08 13:05:03 To control boiler pressure?
general 2022-11-08 13:05:08 Ah
general 2022-11-08 13:06:01 I haven't done any automatic things for it but it's not that hard. Easiest way is to just vent steam if the pressure is too high and also don't fill the boiler with so much water at once
general 2022-11-08 13:06:08 Only fill it with as much as you need
general 2022-11-08 13:06:31 Okay
general 2022-11-08 13:16:18 Gay

general 2022-11-08 14:38:59 I'm not doing art tho
general 2022-11-08 14:39:33 What is it trying to solve for tho?
general 2022-11-08 14:39:59 Also you still have chalkboards?
general 2022-11-08 14:40:49 I know what trigonometry is but are you doing that for the circles on the shape
general 2022-11-08 14:41:27 Trig identities have a lot to do with trig
general 2022-11-08 14:42:01 Also I hate the way this is formatted
general 2022-11-08 14:42:22 Goodnight
general 2022-11-08 14:42:27 Hi Floppa
general 2022-11-08 14:44:44 Do you know about Bell curves
general 2022-11-08 14:44:48 and normal distributions?
general 2022-11-08 14:45:17 The way we had it the formats were much nicer
general 2022-11-08 14:45:23 I'll get a picture
general 2022-11-08 14:47:52 Hang on give me a moment
general 2022-11-08 14:47:56 Still tryna find my sheet
general 2022-11-08 14:48:51 These obviously aren't all the trig identities but it's enough. You can derive the rest
general 2022-11-08 14:49:29 Ya
general 2022-11-08 14:50:04 Wtf is biet
general 2022-11-08 14:50:08 Oh
general 2022-11-08 14:50:28 Does it just mean given that tan a = 1/3
general 2022-11-08 14:51:56 The what
general 2022-11-08 14:53:41 <@411104247766056960> Why are US math exams multiple choice
general 2022-11-08 14:55:07 We have standardised tests here too
general 2022-11-08 14:55:14 But they aren't multiple chpice
general 2022-11-08 14:55:35 EVERYONE gets the exact same test depending on their exam board
general 2022-11-08 14:56:21 Here we have Edexcel, AQA and OCR.
OCR is mostly for engineering or business type of things. Edexcel and AQA are the usual Math, English, Science crap

general 2023-02-16 22:47:44 What the fuck is that grip?

general 2023-02-16 22:49:24 Don't really care tbh
general 2023-02-16 22:49:39 If your computer is so ancient that it's still running 32 bit system that's your problem
general 2023-02-16 22:50:19 To hold the recoil spring

general 2023-02-17 21:37:25 All depends on how you fly it
general 2023-02-17 21:37:43 I like the early Griffon Spitfires tho
general 2023-02-17 21:37:55 Late griffons are quite expensive for sim
general 2023-02-17 21:38:06 That being said tho
general 2023-02-17 21:38:24 The Mk 24 is at 6.3 in sim instead of 7.0 so that's probably okay
general 2023-02-17 21:38:29 It's a beast of a plane
general 2023-02-17 21:39:30 Yesterday it was Tortoise what happened?

general 2023-02-20 01:36:44 Most people die because they are dumb fucks who don't know how to look around
general 2023-02-20 01:37:23 Even when you tell them in chat "BEHIND YOU  THERE IS AN ENEMY COMING YOUR WAY" they just do nothing

general 2023-02-20 23:30:41 Anyway all I'm saying is
general 2023-02-20 23:31:12 Don't act all superior just because you chose to play a more realistic game. It's a game you're meant to have fun

general 2023-02-22 23:41:36 The pink was chosen as it was the best camo for the most vunerable times for attack, sunset and sunrise
