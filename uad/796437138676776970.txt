creations-chat 2021-10-11 16:15:17 This is something that I was unaware of, thank you
creations-chat 2021-10-11 16:20:06 I guess it’s good my Axolotl can swim too
creations-chat 2021-10-11 16:29:15 The Axolotl is gone from <#384025409945337856> now

creations-chat 2021-11-11 13:52:10 I’m in the process of converting my pvp abner read into something more nice looking

creations-chat 2021-11-17 00:48:00 My build is definitely perfect, I mean there is definitely no way I could’ve done anything better and you’re definitely toxic if you say there is

plane-crazy 2021-11-17 18:05:44 I am very concerned about the community
creations-chat 2021-11-19 00:04:36 <@!378612526151237642> , what style of Tombstone you doing, there’s one with an open structure above the blade and there’s one with a closed structure, however, both have only have a full length blade on each side.

the-dump 2021-11-29 15:30:37 They most likely do that based on their AI learning core, aka supervised (mimicking) and unsupervised (learning)
the-dump 2021-11-29 15:32:03 Yea kinda
the-dump 2021-11-29 15:34:35 Anyone else get that feeling when something super relatable is only unique to you? Or is that just me?
