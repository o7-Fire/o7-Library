general 2021-05-15 20:48:34 hi guys
general 2021-05-15 20:48:56 can motors be used to cause rockets to stabilize
general 2021-05-15 20:49:00 like with their torque
general 2021-05-15 20:49:04 (mid flight)
general 2021-05-15 20:50:43 but does it also work
general 2021-05-15 20:50:47 in plane crazy
general 2021-05-15 20:50:59 because they are used in real rockets i know that
general 2021-05-15 20:51:51 hmmm
how many motors does it require to have a 4x4 rocket with a 2x2 area inside to make it useful
general 2021-05-15 20:52:01 i tried engines but they have a little too much power
general 2021-05-15 20:52:43 like the youtube tutorials are just tiny missiles and one where it just goes up
