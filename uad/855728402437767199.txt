plane-crazy 2023-01-15 03:57:54 tried making wing sweep without exposing a motor but yeah this happens <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 03:58:17 it jams
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 04:01:28 HMMMMMMM

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 04:10:26 what
general 2023-01-22 04:01:14 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 04:48:20 how to mek outer plyon <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 05:12:18 god  damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 05:12:24 even the map looks realistic
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 05:30:13 damn bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:49:18 the A
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:49:45 that was a hard shot to take
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:49:59 anyway how to do the danger intake triangle
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:07:14 to ro size a car, you must learn the ways of making of the air, land, and sea vehicles ro size
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:07:33 or motorlock <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:10:18 how do you do that exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:21:37 dze thrusters could get a rework coz it dont look like that but it a 5 for me
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:22:26 also do i see ange lock on noze
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:26:37 it better if you move the whole elevator since it do be like that irl, also more manueverability <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:27:29 unless it collides with the wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:46:46 blueprents are key to perfec skel
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:47:56 maths <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:51:00 im on my calculator and pen and paper
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:52:00 i dont see how you measure the car, for example 25 meters, how u gonna turn that into pc blocks cause you said 1 block = 0.7 meters?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:52:16 0.7 then multiply?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:53:20 damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:53:27 soo
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:54:54 for example if the scale on the bp is 25m long, and a pc block scale is 0.7, then i multiply that 0.7 by 25, then my results got 17.5 blocks, is that right?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:18 i dont see how its connected <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:22 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:27 divide let me see
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:41 that gives me 35 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:56:10 that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:58:12 say do you include decimals when converting the size to block size
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:58:48 hm
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:00:04 do you like, round up round down the decimals when doing so?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:01:06 the resize tool would make my job alot easier ppacing alot of blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:02:32 anyway i did some stuff and i dont piston lock so, if i take the length of the f18 hornet (17.1m), then divide it by 0.7, i would get about 24.4 but again i dont piston lock so i get about 25? <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:02:50 oh wait thats .4 decimal
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:02:52 23*
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:03:26 i always thought i was knots or mph
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:03:47 fair since we have half blocks in the game
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:04:19 kph i see
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:41 got damn thats old
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:47 got damn?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:51 god damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:06:42 im wondering why you cant adjust helium like you do with ballast blocks <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:09:25 after having a math lesson with you my conscience is only telling me to redo all my jets <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:10:53 style + reliability is my criteria but scale apparently is now one of them
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:11:25 my newest one will probably take a whole lot of references and blueprints
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:12:18 oh yeah that one too
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:12:40 ill keep that in mind for my next one
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:01 oh so that changes the scale ill be dividing my length to
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:16 i see
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:29 ight
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:48:46 eff four phantm

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:19 f22 vs 23
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:13 the f23 does look like identical with the su57 in some parts like the intakes
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:47 wait there were two f22 variants?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:01:21 but the f35 took the lightning II how come the f22 had it
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:01:48 agile : )
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:47 wait the f22 doesnt operate on carriers.?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:16 less stealthier tho cuz the back thrusters have the top part exposed
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:38 yez
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:07:18 f14 was just a jet body with two enginea and thrusters glued to the side and some wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:08:42 u guys seen an invisible jet before?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:09:28 f18 is actually good
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:10:28 would make it look like a eurofighter ish

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:12:58 also did they put the elevators infront of the wings like the eurofighter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:14:07 the f22 doesnt look that bad actually
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:14:16 no jet gay
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:14:37 but the su23 took it way too seriously

plane-crazy 2023-03-21 01:57:30 bullshit, is f35 obviously
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:24:25 yes but f35 is multi role aircraft <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:27:13 you just angle lock wings
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:29:11 motor, powered+locked
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:29:15 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:29:31 you have the option to piston lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:30:02 tsk
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:30:10 just make wings
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:30:13 not big problem lah
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:30:46 have you tried camera lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:34:51 oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:35:23 pistong lock thenn
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:35:47 and zen angle lock dem
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:51:03 this looks short or is it ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:15:38 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:16:02 also its a two seat super hornet
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:19:44 but yeah i should probably extend the canopy
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:19:55 or what this guy said
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:21:43 yeah i use about 4 deltas
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:22:14 i think mine is the F
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:22:31 ree
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:23:17 the wing area that connects from the canopy to the wings look right ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:23:25 or maybe its too wide
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:24:08 yeah its what i tried to do
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:25:07 thank
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:26:05 i think i made the left side look like an f16 wing
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:26:16 wait no it shouldnt be like that
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:28:30 alright ill make adjustments
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:29:36 since ill probably extend the nose and canopy cause the wing area ends somewhere inbetween the pilot and the wso, should i angle lock the wing area to the actual wings
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:29:59 cause some of the angles cant be achieved by 1x4 before becoming too wide
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:30:17 yea xd
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:30:49 im guessing it an f35cee
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:30:56 coz carrier
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:38:20 nevermind the other stuff but i changed my wings angle
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:38:21 is it good?

plane-crazy 2023-04-28 14:48:52 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 14:49:10 well it depends on the jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 14:50:03 i personally recommend you the F35A

plane-crazy 2023-04-28 14:50:24 yes

plane-crazy 2023-04-28 15:02:59 so when i deploy the springs
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 15:03:06 the springs will take the rocket hit for me

plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:33:55 tsk
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:33:59 custom landing gear?
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:34:19 pre made landing gear does the job <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:35:39 i like the armament
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:35:53 and that long ass turret on the front
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:25 ohh swordfish
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:34 that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:36:43 so its a custom?
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:37:42 ehh not really and i can prove it
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:38:02 you can use it on very big builds too

plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:41:32 well the F14 has a small front landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:41:57 my guy my nose is filled with propellers <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:43:22 when my F14 pitches up or rolls it slows down so i added propellers since they work best at slower speeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:44:17 aint a cobra gonna do anything in a dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:44:35 most planes can go from full speed to a stall in seconds
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:48:10 any opinions on the nose design
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 02:49:16 i forgot the squadron i tooko inspiration on the design from

plane-crazy 2023-05-13 00:25:13 not mine btw
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 00:26:09 the nose is ok
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 00:26:16 you could angle lock it
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 00:26:44 nah its just a few parts

plane-crazy 2023-05-13 02:08:07 does that exist
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 13:21:43 you should make the intake a cylinder too so it matches perfectly with a jet engine
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 15:26:24 could work but its useless
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 15:27:15 might aswell just build a giant rotating radar dish
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 15:29:04 this works great when they are blacklisted
creations-chat 2023-05-14 15:35:37 <@732477283163439165> i love the bradley tho i have some questions, how did you make the turret
