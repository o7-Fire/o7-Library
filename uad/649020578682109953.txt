help 2022-11-20 20:23:20 I'm building the Polar Express, but I need an easy way to align the wagons to fit the magnets, does anyone know of a way to do this?
help 2022-11-20 20:25:43 lol
help 2022-11-21 01:38:31 I appreciate your advice, but for my builds (usually trains) I use a base color of usually 50 50 50 as it's easier for me to see the blocks. After having the base of the construction I start with the details and finally the colors and textures. As seen in the screenshots, I'm not finished yet, that's why the lack of details and the color
help 2022-11-21 02:50:42 Polar Express update, STILL in progress (I can't upload images on other channels because I don't have the level yet lol)
