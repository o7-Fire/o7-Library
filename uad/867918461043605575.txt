general 2022-09-19 11:02:40 hello there
general 2022-09-19 11:04:00 how are you meant to have evidence being 13?
general 2022-09-19 11:04:26 oh that makes sense

general 2022-09-19 11:06:24 nothings wrong with being a furry, furries that just do the things they like is okay like meeting up with friends or gaming that's okay. But if their degenerative then that's when you can start arguing with them.

general 2022-09-19 11:09:10 the degenerative furries we have right now makes all the non degenerative furries look bad. While in Egyptian times Furries were GODS they had more potential than another f3x builder game
