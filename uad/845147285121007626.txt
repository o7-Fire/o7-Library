plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:17:55 do yall know how to motor lock a plane body and still have it function?
help 2022-07-20 04:30:11 My planes (a5m and f-1) any ideas on how to improve and add more?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 16:33:06 Get outta here you goofy ahh bot
help 2022-07-20 19:56:17 is it possible to make a block more dense than it should be? im using motorlocking for an engine and it made the back of the jet much heavier so it constantly turns up, is there any way to fix this
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 21:45:35 Motor 2’s
help 2022-07-20 21:49:49 If that’s true I hate it
help 2022-07-20 22:32:49 thats why i spent 15 minutes on my ballast block's
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:13:14 F-2 viper zero
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:15:21 how many servers have you destroyed with that plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:15:47 ah
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:41:34 am i the only one who builds my planes cockpit first?
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:43:06 naw you start with the seat and build around it
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:43:18 its more easy
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:43:50 because if you know the size of the cockpit then you can use it as a scale to make the rest of the plane more accurate
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:44:48 like building a F-1 you look at a photo of it and i use the cockpit as a way to measure the areas.
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:46:21 naw
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:46:36 also how do i make the tip of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:47:04 yeah, i just slap a pyramid on it because idk how
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:49:22 skin like color and camo pale green and a dark green = good plane camo
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 23:49:56 i hope your motorlocks break

help 2022-07-23 05:23:14 what do plane builders mean by 1 wides? do they mean the cockpit or the entire plane
help 2022-07-23 05:24:24 wouldnt the cockpit not be centred then?
help 2022-07-23 05:24:34 also why would people want that
help 2022-07-23 05:25:21 fair point
help 2022-07-23 05:26:14 hold on the cockpit isnt in the center then?

help 2022-07-23 05:45:26 im tryna get my plane to look as realistic as possible but its hard when i have barely used motorlocks yet + i will try with my next plane (because they look really goofy rn)
help 2022-07-23 05:46:45 yeah but thats the problem with actual jets because they are mostly solid color except a few stickers

help 2022-08-04 03:41:14 is the landing gear motorlocked (like is there a block half way through that would make the wheel go into a block?)
creations-chat 2022-08-04 03:43:28 canadian busses are goofy
help 2022-08-04 03:44:16 yes but is there a moving block (landing gear) in a non moving block
help 2022-08-04 03:45:56 thats probably why, save the build and delete the block then try it, if it doesnt work then im wrong but if it does work then there is the fix to your problem.
help 2022-08-04 03:47:19 did it work?
help 2022-08-04 03:47:45 O_O
creations-chat 2022-08-04 04:21:23 its not even motor locked O_O

general 2022-08-06 03:08:04 middle right
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 04:37:03 imagine like 80 mini motorlocked bombs
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:40:11 bro what is that 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:44:23 i mean it would work but if your mig isnt WASD then when you try to aim the missile the plane will follow the missile (wouldn't you just follow the bomb because it has the same controls as plane?+ if you miss you gotta steer and not crash the plane and the bomb)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:47:04 building massive ships is pain (im tryna make a large battleship and im now trying to fold upwards) are upward folds even possible? (this was edit part)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:49:55 oml i just checked the about me is absolutely goofy 💀
help 2022-08-06 04:50:53 with building big ships is it possible to fold upward?

creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:56:39 but memes are meant to be funny O_o (and not concerning)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:59:20 +its slightly disturbing

help 2022-08-07 02:38:29 is there a good ship i should try to build? ( im tryna learn to make large ships and well idk how)
help 2022-08-07 02:39:53 sure
help 2022-08-07 04:48:31 motor locking is a setting inside the motor settings that says "lock"
if you put 2 locked motors together (stacked) they fuse the blocks attached to them.
if you make a tower of these in different patterns you can make blocks, designs and motors that you cant normally get.
help 2022-08-07 04:50:25 also motorlocks dont need to be used in every build like most boats only use little to no motor locks (its mostly the jets and planes)
help 2022-08-07 04:51:11 O_O
help 2022-08-07 04:54:54 oo i forgot about tanks (its just that motorlocks are only used for details on boats while it makes up half a jet)+ naw im just helping a new player get rid of their skill issue
help 2022-08-07 05:01:23 :(
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:27:43 only if you're using a jet, boat and tank 1v1's are amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:30:11 i hate how big jets and planes are in the game, it is in the name but boats and tanks are so much better if you want to actually play the game (pvp tanks r rare sadly but pvp boats are a bit more common)
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:33:02 fair point but i dislike the sort of obsession the game has with jets, I've seen 3 actual boats and about 200 jets that look half the same
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:35:49 goofy opinion
help 2022-08-10 02:16:20 is 3x the plot big enough for a furutaka cruiser? (its a thin ship so its only horizontal folds)
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:17:35 get out
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:11:01 is 3 plot lengths long enough for a furutaka? (cruiser ship and its thin)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:51:14 i also want to see the goofy ahh mech
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:56:31 yes,we all want the goody ahh mech
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:32:27 i have asked like 80 times what is a normal size for a cruiser ship? (is 3 plots too long??)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:35:01 ok thx (im trying to make a furutaka and i dont want the ship to be too small)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:40:43 k
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:08:26 mechs suck for pvp but they look cool
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:10:59 no? the motors are not fast enough or specific enough to use any weapon unless you strapped missiles to the sides and spammed, a jet or tank can absolutely destroy a mech because they break and are 99% helium blocks and float
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:15:48 have you ever heard of bombs? or any rockets at all? they are massive targets that cant do 2 things at once, they are useless to any bomber or just about anything that doesnt stand still.

creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:20:44 i would assume? unless your kidding and it got downvoted to hell  this server votes on what it can be compared to and how hidden the insides are, like how a domino's someone made gets more upvotes than a not half bad looking jet.

creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:47:12 clear is better due to detail and well it looks nice, just make it clear and slap some trails on the corners
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 01:33:11 you can use some methods online but they only work for a small tower (just 3)
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 01:34:52 no, thats an awful rule that would ruin pvp and cause glitches that didnt need to be there
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 01:35:16 also your name is "ihatethisgame" get out

plane-crazy 2022-09-14 01:42:24 also quick question, is are those motor 2 wings or control panels
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 01:52:21 sorry for the response delay but just use 1, it makes both worse if you use 2 + use control panels an make the rest of your wing empty and cover with trapdoors to decrease on weight

help 2022-09-14 03:36:05 make motors with no power and only lock, place it so its facing up then one ontop of it facing down, look up the different towers you can use but motor locking is a way to make things the game didnt have, such as angles not normal to the game or just simple details on a build
help 2022-09-14 03:38:19 this is how it should look and work, its a way to compress and add detail and also buff pvp weapons such as bombs or guns

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:59:51 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 04:00:48 the only difference is the f-18 like intake
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 04:01:34 the wings intake and tiny bit of the middle tail is different but i looks the same

help 2022-09-16 02:44:05 well yeah but if its meant to be a force field im thinking it opens real quick or in a area then closes fast
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 02:44:45 i wonder if it can reach the sky island with just the arms
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 02:45:32 they are the same picture
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 02:47:23 what i find the worst is that not even the details are correct, the ears, the head, and even just the leg pattern is completely wrong and it hurts to look at
help 2022-09-16 02:48:36 i would say a smaller full version, if its too large then the force field is useless

creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:54:41 they do not know what a turboprop is because turboprob is a JET engine
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 02:56:08 O_O
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:56:44 i hate the insane amount of tutorial f-14's i see in every pvp lobby + that heli is amazing
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 02:59:05 o wait im stupid thats just the legs...
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:01:21 im not sure but they called the engine "turboprop" and it killed me along with those goofy wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:01:48 yep 👍
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:02:43 hm, i havent seen any tutorial a-10s but ive seen like 1-6 that look the same but its far more rare than the f-14's
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:04:14 what hurts more is that turboprop is a type of jet engine
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:04:31 go to jail
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:05:45 what tank is it+ is it loaded in or are we seeing goofy un motorlocked version because of text boxes

plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:08:27 isnt it "TheMadVulpen"?
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:09:08 WAIT HOLD ON YOUR RIGHT
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:10:13 why do you always make very cursed things
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:10:25 1 block wide isnt that bad...
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:12:31 pvp 1blocks are good but 2 block wides are annoying and heavy, only ueful in planes like a-10, also a-10 is horrific its ugly and i hate it

plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:15:36 nice jet also please get better at painting, i think ive seen u in a server once because your the only person ive seen paint 1 wing side completely red
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:17:20 💀  also the wings look like ass, use control surfaces and trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:17:52 oh wait damn it appears people actually do that
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:18:01 thats not helping
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:19:42 motor locking and yes its still a jet engine, do you call a turbo jet engine a propeller engine because it has blades?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:22:02 note the wiki saying the "turbine" and the "intake" that dont sound very prop engine like. Its literally listed as  a jet engine, if your gonna use wiki to back up your claims then atlease be right about it

also the engine dont matter it still looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:24:45 also still looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:26:59 bro your not even educated enough to know simple jet engines let alone building or judging others with your severe lack of skill with building or making a plane that works because you refuse better methods of making the wings

depends on the type of cheese, that could be a gift
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:29:49 motor locking, if you want it fancy then add some angle locking. Use trapdoors and control panels for wings for faster turning and auto stabilizing, also builds are meant to look nice

also trapdoors are 49x lighter than disconectors, skill issue

the point is to be in the sky...
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:32:20 im confused whether to call the plane good bad or weird (the b-58)
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:34:03 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:34:11 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:34:40 how does that look slightly close to a su-33
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:35:23 it has the american airforce logo thing on the side
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:36:55 ik im gonna sound real dumb for this but is it a f-15 or 14, the intakes are the same but the angled intakes tell me f-14 

also not as good as f-2 (f-16 is mid)
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:37:56 oo goodpoint, it also has the nose gun
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:38:47 also still Mitsubishi f-2 is better than the older f-16
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:41:46 yes but have you ever seen a 1block wide a-10? its awful
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:43:28 im the last person to talk in every single plane crazy related channel >:)
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:44:12 gotta get 3 or 2 block wide for any bomber, maybe 2 for a-10
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:46:14 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:46:33 :(
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 03:46:51 >:(
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:31:54 why is it sad+ goofy upvote
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:35:37 the community expects things to look good because of all the different ways we can get things to look good, they downvote when something looks like ass because they didnt care or think to add small details that make a good build

also if it looks like ass nobody cares about how it works, they care about looks and the ways you can get it to look good
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:38:36 skill issue+get better at building+ratio+build better
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:40:41 annoying person is being rude to people who thought a bad build looked bad and people dont like that they are defending the worst build (also i hate creations chat cooldown )

oh u changed it nvm then
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:43:07 ah, fair point srry for the mix up i thought you were talking about persons awful opinion

help 2022-09-16 22:43:18 does + camera folding, use youtube and look up different types of folds
help 2022-09-16 22:44:20 on ground or in air?
help 2022-09-16 22:46:04 well with air just just tune your jet, if wobble sideways then add vertical wing panels inside the plane (front or back) same with wobble upwards, just add wing panels in front or back
help 2022-09-16 22:46:42 if on ground then it might be a broken angle lock, make sure to lock the motors when angle locking and or there might be a moving part within the motor lock
help 2022-09-16 23:05:11 you need to lock and power the motors that the moving parts are on, if the lock isnt on they just glitch out and break
help 2022-09-16 23:07:15 when you do a angle lock type thing your making you must lock the moving motors to prevent them from glitching
help 2022-09-16 23:08:10 use purple tool and turn lock on the motors that do the moving, move the motors where you want then use the disconnectors <@653563056034545674>

help 2022-09-21 02:36:32 you cant hide that motor lock, gotta change it so the top of the aircraft is on top of the tower, or you can add some trapdoors to it (would look bad tho)

plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:24:09 💀  also that intake makes me wanna cry (the su 25)
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:25:07 what is a gold
help 2022-10-01 00:26:27 ye (also there isnt really a beginner rotating, its very simple so yeah its good)
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:26:56 please post a build
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:28:30 i looked at your creations that blackbird nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:46:47 anything that isnt good roscale looks mad goofy
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:47:56 im not gonna say its bad but its bad that the only expert you have is designer
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:48:29 also without roscale you rlly be upvoting entire plot sized cars
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:50:09 why are you defending someone who thinks that roscale is bad (without roscale you're builds look awful because a car is 2 plots large and you jet is 3 blocks long)
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:51:29 ro scale is using your character to measure a build to be the correct size, without it you get the ugly 300x the size cars and over sized builds
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:52:37 and without it you get a 3000 block car
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:53:10 and its 3x the size of your character
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 00:54:10 AND it ruins the accuracy of the build making it from an impressive build to a large car
help 2022-10-01 23:18:02 how do i start building a bomber ? (for planes in the nose but its sorta hard to start large builds so i would like to know how) (srry this was for a heli but then i realized i dont really have one i wanna make, so i swapped to bombers)
help 2022-10-01 23:36:42 also is it possible to fit a large amount of motor locked bombs within a 3.5 wide and 6 block tall area? (length dont matter)

plane-crazy 2022-10-03 03:18:08 eh the memes are sorta bad but the one f-14 is good
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 03:21:26 why did you post a image of a plane crazy boat
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:27:18 1 wide is for pvp 2 wide is for looks, it swaps depending on how your build looks
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:30:32 all of suggestions is just pc2, i think they might want the game to be released (also 1 wide is best for pvp ) <@654091171433283637> 💀
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:32:56 do you only build bombers? (also that f-18 is horrific)
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:36:18 nobody knows, it might be an attempt to make a flying snake that looks horrific (also b-1 or tu-160? or something else <@523003901075521536> )
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:42:26 isnt that the point of pvp jets? (also using patterns of control surfaces as wings is op) and i just realized the su34 is just a thicker figher and i hate it

creations-chat 2022-12-21 03:09:36 huh
help 2023-04-08 00:11:32 can anyone give me tips for motorlocking/anglelocking on helicopers?
help 2023-04-08 00:14:23 my problem isnt the motorlocking its the fact its on a heli
help 2023-04-08 00:16:10 
help 2023-04-08 00:16:19 im new to heli making and angle locking
help 2023-04-08 00:17:13 im trying to make the side piece the ch-148 has because its angled odd and im not experienced enough with angle locking to do as well as i should
help 2023-04-08 01:10:58 got it
help 2023-04-08 03:15:39 why when i use spring motorlocks it flings my build into space or through the ground
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:04:04 the thingamabob
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:04:27 the whoseamawhatsit
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:12:44 cylander canopys are horrific
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:13:10 easy to make very rarely done rigjt
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:13:14 right
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:13:38 like maybe an f-16 but im seeing these on tomcats and its just awful
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:17:56 actually pretty good
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:49:51 anyone know how to not fling yourself when locking with springs, i asked the help channel but got ignored
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:35 im making a helicopter and it takes 6 tries to spawn in normally
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:48 doesnt happen when i remove the springs
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:51:24 i meant i like pvp servers but building means you gotta test it out and i dont wanna get shredded the second i spawn in, especially with angle locks
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:13 fr
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:44 nah idk how to use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:54:11 took me a day to finally understand angle locking i aint gonna suffer learning a worse version
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:54:40 not really
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:55:38 motor locking is easy, angle locking is when it begins to suffer, angle locking only looks good if its perfect and it begins to look like that one microsoft screen saver
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:56:07 this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:56:43 didnt know stoppers existed but then again i get less room then
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:57:13 whats the block sticking out the nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:57:37 is it like a motorlock error or intentional
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:57:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:12 naww
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:42 bro
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:55 its like 2 blocks of angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:00:44 i love how people shit on mechs but like tanks despite the fact their the same
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:01:44 good amount of people dont like mechs despite that they can actually do some damage if its good, while tanks are defenseless and die instantly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:02:20 actually made one once, was incredible i recommend it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:03:50 also if you give your mech a sword its amazing to slice a plane out of the air
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:05:08 ive seen you post this thing 3 times i cant tell a single piece of it apart its like a wheres waldo of finding a wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:19 eurofighter tornado sweep wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:49 ever see the f-23?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:09:13 f-23 is beautiful
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:09:38 look at this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:09:48 yes its incredible
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:10:24 every proposed 6th gen fighter is just a copy of this, its because its perfect
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:32 cough cough
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:52 avro arrow was insane tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:12:28 would be cool if it had thicker wings and differently shaped fuel pod things
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:12:42 not even a millimeter
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:27 also while we talk about incredible planes lemmie just put this up
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:38 best prop plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:43 10/10
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:30 ong
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:45 mig 27-23 best
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:36 but its cool as hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:16:43 sabre tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:18:00 to add on to this gotta love the A5M
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:19:34 what about the harrier, looks goofy did incredible things
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:13 disgusting
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:50 yeah but its box intake but not even the good kind
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:11 a fatter f-35
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:26 its just a f-35 but thick
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:57 overrated
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:03 i see it everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:56 the eurof15?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:17 yeah but gotta say it looks good
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:24:20 actually hot take but i find the f-15 ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:24:30 its a box with wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:13 good explanation
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:26:09 maybe mig-27/23
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:26:32 they work with the sweep wing but yeah it did fall apart
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:36 wonder what they have today that we dont know about
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:28:17 actually speaking of f-14 the f-22 carrier version was almost made hold on
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:28:55 look at this modern f-22 f-14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:20 i dont wanna say i believe in that but if that was in the 60's not a suprise if we have better by now
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:40 its a proposed f-22 carrier version
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:43 perfect square intakes though
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:31:08 jaguar is underrated
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:31:59 yeah sadly the f-35 looks like shit but preforms the opposite
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:33:13 they doo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:33:32 most jets would look and preform 100x better if they have variable wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:36:02 i made a mig-27 and the wings killed me, took me like a day to get them to move
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:14 even bombers work better with swept wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:50 actually tried to make a b1 bomber, gave up on the wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:39:41 how would you do ro-scale, dont understand how that works because im making a helicoper that can fit around 10 people and its 2 meters wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:47 actually in roscale the f-14 is massive
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:02 ever see the photos of the tiny people in the giant cockpits
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:10 pretty sure you can use both
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:42 perfect 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:43:08 they think of 3 blocks (2 on the side)
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:44:03 no i would say proper roscale shifts from 3-2, some jets are huge some people make them super small
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:44:42 .5?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:45:15 would that be like 1block and half a block? aint worth the locks to do that but in terms for size yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:05 fr, one block f-14's hurt my mind
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:30 also that one tutorial f-14 that you see in every pvp server
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:48:07 i used to do that but eventually felt bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:15 also i forgot the name but that one guy who have the tutorials to make your jets weigh 3 blocks and they are horrific
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:25 yeo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:27 yep
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:49 idk but it hurts to see 3 nam nam jets in a server
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:26 also with nam nam jets you cant add anything to them, i made one once and i couldnt mod after i made it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:05 helium and ballast blocks tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:24 and they all use the same nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:37 never seen a nam nam jet with a normal nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:57 yeah but he puts a nose tutorial in his vids, they copy him
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:52:09 no, no its not
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:52:38 kfc sieg heil?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:53:46 some kinda carrier?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:45 yeah but i gotta say the m2m tutorial actually helps, never knew how to before
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:29 i didnt know there was an option other than wasd
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:57:34 bit too neon for an afterburner, most are pastel yellow/purple
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:59:48 yeah not sure when that added that but dont think it does anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:56 actually have a light grey smoke pipe it gives an exhaust typa feel to the jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:03:20 yeah, make it lighter
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:47 dont you hate when you have been motorlocking for a while then realise you never locked the motors
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:58 its horrific
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:30 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:40 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:54 yeah i meant to forget to turn that on when making a long tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:09:25 you rlly thought i individually went thround the motors? im not a psycho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:21 also the builds where theres just so much unnecessary motor locks to the point they think its a flex but it looks like garbage
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:11:12 actually when i started actually playing the game i build like max build height towers, so many wasted minutes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:11:27 use ballast blocks, save some hours
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:12:28 actually i did for a while too but dont overdo it on helicopters, currently struggling to balance a ch-148 and its painful
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:12:54 lmao, got any side motors?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:06 ah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:43 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:56 like just random motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:14:45 agreed, found a m2m heli tutorial that might save me i havent tried it yet but hoping it does
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:15:14 is it a long tower or can ya just swap em out
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:15:55 take photos or screenshots of the wings and copy em
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:16:45 eh idk, im trying to make a realistic heli but every time i add anything it makes me die inside
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:18:07 dont make a heli, also single rotor helis hurt double the amount
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:19:26 not gonna say im new but i havent reached the stage of motor lock where i can make it look like a spider web
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:20:32 also cant imagine messing up a single lock and having to search that web of locks to fix it
help 2023-04-08 15:09:05 Make wings motorlocked wing panel and half block then slide a landing gear into they half block
creations-chat 2023-04-08 15:10:40 Not bad but motorlock or add some trap doors or panels over the cheese grader wings
creations-chat 2023-04-08 15:15:10 Are the wings locked motors or are they angle locked? You could prolly make a tower then angle lock em for less effort
creations-chat 2023-04-08 15:19:58 Wouldn’t mind dms but also just make a motorlock tower up and angle lock the wing tips while connecting them to the main tower by trail/camera blocks
creations-chat 2023-04-08 16:11:26 Looks good, if your gonna post it this would be an alright but I would recommend to fix the back but I cant really help with that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:12:42 That runways thick as hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:15:48 It’s an entire plot thick what
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:17:06 Pretty sure there’s a photo but someone made a really long runway but it was properly sized, why make it thick
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:19:58 Wdym small propellers, ain’t the point to auto balance and hover?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:24:30 Hard angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:24:54 Gotta make one straight cylinder then add the angles with angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:27:05 Then what’s the problem
creations-chat 2023-04-08 16:49:43 Your just a designer 2 you can’t really call people white names yet
creations-chat 2023-04-08 17:28:00 Ain’t no way you said white name activity’s with builds like that 💀
creations-chat 2023-04-08 17:57:54 Well is it a Ukrainian helicopter?
creations-chat 2023-04-08 20:57:12 Please shut up also <@871665669412909086> that nose and side of the heli hurts to look at
help 2023-04-08 21:01:15 Any ideas on how to do the horizontal stabilizer? It’s lopsided and idk how to fix this
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:27:22 You shit on people while posting it and you refused to admit there’s anything wrong with it despite the fact it hurts to look at, it’s bad and you know it you just won’t admit it
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:29:34 The nose is looks like crumpled paper, the sides look deformed with different blocks where there should t be and the tail is a bad attempt of skill, it’s bad and you don’t listen
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:31:38 I hope your hit by a Russian missile, because that would be the only moment In your life where your even the slightest bit bright
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:33:53 
help 2023-04-08 21:35:52 K
creations-chat 2023-04-08 23:11:08 how do i balance a heli
help 2023-04-09 00:51:05 Add a pilots room on the bottom front
help 2023-04-09 00:52:08 Idk
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:03:22 its good, just feel it should be lower on the nose but that would be a bit complex to do
help 2023-04-09 01:04:22 are all your motor 2's facing the proper way? also because they spawn in different ways they could just be moving to face to your cursor
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:06:14 everything looks great with swept wings
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:07:04 HOF hasnt been added to for a long ass time even if your jet was worthy it prob wouldnt be added
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:09:08 couple hundred, around 300-400 and needs to be given a star emoji thing also 4000 block im pretty sure or thats just the masters thing idk
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:12:24 for a easy explanation, when things go fast less lift is usually needed/more lift is generated from less, kinda like how we used to have massive biplane wings and can now get away with thin wings as we go faster
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:12:34 like the u-2 pencil wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:13:07 underrated but sadly looks ugly for how good it is
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:13:43 ehh i love the tomcat but thanks for topgun the tomcat is incredibly famous
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:15:27 most famous jets (american) are probably f-22 and the f-14,  ya cant really shit on either
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:16:31 ngl topgun 3 with f22 naval would be beautiful
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:16:58 but also 80 year old maverick we would need some future g suits so sadly no
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:19:02 wanna know the most underrated jet?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:19:52 avro arrow, would still be able to compete with modern jets even though it was made at the time of the sabre
help 2023-04-09 01:20:56 mech design is easy, just make sure it doesnt break the joints and make it look like a power ranger rip off and you'll be golden
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:24:31 went faster than f-22 and f-35, was made before modern jets took major form(gen 3 jet in the times of gen 1), from everyone who flew it it was seen as superior to the jets of the times, would have been sold worldwide to around 12 countrys.
4-1
help 2023-04-09 01:27:33 its because its a tutorial frame, make your own and it will save time
help 2023-04-09 01:28:03 its the same as double rotor, might have to make it spin a bit faster though
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:33:14 it wasnt made into service due to politics and it was more expensive than the gen 1 jets, though it would be a good price nowadays it would be like selling a f-14 to 1940's USA, they would think its too much to pay
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:33:56 also the speed did help as it was an interceptor and one of the first nuclear carrying jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:38:27 yep, we would probably have modern Canadian jets if it wasnt cancelled and avro would be a large aviation company
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:41:06 and with that the canadian military drops a hell of alot more than it should have and now it sucks we rely on the usa for nearly everything in our military
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:44:06 actually yeah usa has a large hold in world military, but we would still be better off in the air force if we made and sold our own planes, maybe even helicopters or transport if avro led more company's to make air vehicles
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:45:26 yep, its not too fun to know your country could be alot better if they just spent a little more on one project
help 2023-04-09 01:46:28 fake rotor can work but i find it more complex to add alot of tiny propellers instead of just balancing/adding drag
help 2023-04-09 01:48:33 eh my current heli is single prop with real propellers and its going pretty good though i can see how it would be good with the fake propellers so not my place to say, kinda a preference
help 2023-04-09 01:51:17 no problem but what do you mean the basic ones?
help 2023-04-09 01:52:11 tutorial as in technique or straight copying
help 2023-04-09 01:53:22 nah, the rotor doesnt mean anything the heli is the hard part
help 2023-04-09 01:53:31 hold on
help 2023-04-09 01:55:47 like i would reccoment to watch these vids https://youtu.be/bKO2UPoR27M he doesnt show you how to copy but rather technique and heli basics
help 2023-04-09 01:56:23 its not a straight copy but he explains how to balance, different ways to make a heli and different rotors through the series
help 2023-04-09 01:57:09 yeah he does good vids, pretty sure its ep 4 or 3 that is the single rotor basics
help 2023-04-09 02:00:09 are you familiar with motor/angle locking?
help 2023-04-09 02:02:26 eh its not far off from motor locking but im just gonna say motorlocks dont effect the rotor so if you have any design ideas that works but also i cant really help with balancing because well its impossible through text but experiment, make it look good and watch his tutorials if your serious about heli making
help 2023-04-09 02:04:30 ah, make sure to remember that ballast and heilium blocks exist, helps a ton
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:13:20 There is everything wrong with the wdym
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:27:36 i think its that its not used when vertical
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:27:46 because well its for a plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:28:29 not a clue
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:34:25 naw because tutorials for techniques are good but straight copying is awful
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:48:13 <@740033004604227614> is that really 344 blocks though?
(and if it is why specify it on that dollar store sabre)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:50:17 thats kinda my point, it looks good at first glance but its too blocky for it to be that dense for no reason
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:54:48 <@743927557262671912> please delete that
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:56:58 its a ps5 with wings and a gun dear god kill it with fire and speech bubble it
general 2023-04-09 02:59:30 lemmy just gonna be honest, when you place in creations people expect alot for whatever your building, your ps5 heli doesnt really fit that
creations-chat 2023-04-09 03:00:40 thank god someone did it
general 2023-04-09 03:03:19 Thank you for deleting that
creations-chat 2023-04-09 03:27:13 cant believe you pulled off the swing wings that looks great
creations-chat 2023-04-09 03:31:24 just gonna ignore the mig 23 swept wings?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 03:36:31 actually <@658318819248570381> how did you overlay the 2 images
help 2023-04-09 03:51:26 anyone know how i could add this to my helicopter? (not sure how)
help 2023-04-09 04:06:09 because it looks like ass and your not deleting it or starting over
help 2023-04-09 04:06:41 you cant polish or improve shit, its still gonna be shit
help 2023-04-09 04:08:16 when people mess up they try again they dont just keep adding on to it, its like saying a pizza gets better the more cheese you add and you just dont add anything else
help 2023-04-09 04:09:10 you cant polish a turd its still gonna be shit, u gotta improve and learn
help 2023-04-09 04:11:22 plane crazy has a steep learning curve but once you know how your golden for as long as you play
help 2023-04-09 04:12:14 3 years 💀
help 2023-04-09 04:15:22 use towers, when you can add horizontal towers, see an angle thats hard to do? learn a bit about angle locking, wanna add lines to your cockpit? do a little a both, gotta learn to get good
help 2023-04-09 04:16:02 nobody starts with talent and it isnt helping to deny the proper way of creating good shit
help 2023-04-09 04:16:29 just dont use nam nam
help 2023-04-09 04:16:39 never make a nam nam jet
help 2023-04-09 04:17:29 i hate nam nam and his jets, they cant do anything but turn
help 2023-04-09 04:18:57 fr
help 2023-04-09 04:19:12 they all look the same
help 2023-04-09 04:20:52 yeah but you have to help yourself first, learn the basics of motor and angle locking then you shouldnt have any actual bad builds, i mean they can still turn out meh but with angle and motorlocking (even piston locking) it only takes time
help 2023-04-09 04:21:39 eh i watch this series on heli basics
help 2023-04-09 04:21:43 helps alot
help 2023-04-09 04:23:17 ah im in the middle of my first detailed heli, going alright but still suffering
help 2023-04-09 04:25:22 ngl yeah, its a small touch that usually adds to the build
help 2023-04-09 04:28:23 eh i usually start a side and top outline and go from there
help 2023-04-09 04:28:34 always make a tower though
help 2023-04-09 04:28:41 you will regret not having one
help 2023-04-09 04:31:00 i can relate, my towers end up being dry but i gotta be filling the towers
help 2023-04-09 04:31:17 but also the bottom tower?
help 2023-04-09 04:31:22 why and how
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:31:59 please look at a photo of a me 262
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:32:30 l o o k
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:32:33 on the bottom
help 2023-04-09 04:33:32 idk im thinking about making a ship with my heli because its naval based but i dont know how that works
help 2023-04-09 04:34:24 eh i have a bad habit of not making the most of a tower, like i can and do sometimes but occasionally its just bare and ugly lookin
help 2023-04-09 04:37:02 aw i do that all the time it hurts on a chrome
help 2023-04-09 04:38:59 also when you make an actual vehicle make sure to try to have every angle, like if you can find a free 3d model use it, if you can find real photo's use em if you can find blueprints find those too, always find things to base off of
help 2023-04-09 04:40:28 the thing is lemmy the best way to restart is to actually just restart, if you fix a bad build its still gonna be bad its just gonna be alright looking
help 2023-04-09 04:41:49 the whole ps5 block part and flat sides, people like detail when its possible and in a game of pc where there can be as much detail as you want they will expect as much as you can
help 2023-04-09 04:42:12 so when you or i deliver a shittly low effort build it isnt tolerated
help 2023-04-09 04:43:25 like ya see all the angles textures and things on that, that make it look good? when you leave those out your left with a ps5
help 2023-04-09 04:43:51 thats not your build though
help 2023-04-09 04:44:00 send your build photo
help 2023-04-09 04:46:25 like you see how your build looks bad with less angles less detail and has things missing? thats why people dont like it
help 2023-04-09 04:47:01 also how this is a 2 seater when your build is a one seater
help 2023-04-09 04:47:55 its missing a seat the front the engine the side wing the weapon holder the spikes
help 2023-04-09 04:48:22 thats exactly what you need
help 2023-04-09 04:48:31 what do you think teachers do all day
help 2023-04-09 04:48:44 we are telling you how
help 2023-04-09 04:49:04 put care and effor into your builds and you'll figure it out
help 2023-04-09 15:09:02 Anyone know how I can add the cockpit lines onto this? I’ve never added the lines before and am suffering
help 2023-04-09 15:10:47 yeah i know im on a mac and it goes into photos and i dont wanna open 3 apps just to have a screenshot

creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:11:34 If things move then the center of gravity moves
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:14:11 Please delete this it’s beyond saving

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 22:21:45 Currently 10.3 days into pc what’s y’all’s time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 22:25:59 God damn
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:29:48 Why is it coloured like a 2016 Minecraft skin
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:51:50 ✅ what
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:54:16 Like the m2m tutorial saved a few of my jets, though seeing 7 nam nam jets in a pvp server hurts my soul
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:56:27 I mean the nam nam jets are good but they are horribly optimized to turn, I made one once and it did nothing but turn and I couldn’t edit or change anything after the main build, but they are so ugly now I realise what good jets are
help 2023-04-10 00:10:19 I’d say it’s alright but you should Thicken the wings a bit and make it more smooth
help 2023-04-10 00:55:34 learn how to motor lock, dont just cheat and ask people how it takes 5 seconds to learn
help 2023-04-10 00:56:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 01:06:46 dont ya just love realising a build your making wont work so you have to restart 650 blocks in
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:52:58 its horrific
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:53:31 also aint nobody talk about how nice the harrier looks
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:53:50 beauty
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:54:27 also the f104 starfighter slaps
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:54:52 thank god someone with good taste
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:56:07 no its because its had so many accidents in such a small amount of time
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:56:32 i mean its a good jet but f-35 tipsy as hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:57:12 nevery heard of a harrier vtol crash, there are 3 f-35 vtol crashes that i know of
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:58:07 if your not counting engines then prolly a glider
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:58:19 gliders thin and slim as hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:58:39 HELL YEAH
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:58:46 i love mig 23 and 27
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:58:52 the swept wing is incredible
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:59:08 but it looks incredible
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:59:50 i hate every su plane that ever existed, they all the same and they are all so ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 02:59:55 dont know why people like them
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 03:00:16 ok the camo is an exeption its great
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 03:01:01 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 03:01:43 everyone knows about the swept wing fighter but bombers look insane
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 03:02:03 b-1 best bomber of all time hot as hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 03:02:39 hot take but i hate the f-15 its just a box with wings

help 2023-04-10 04:31:55 gotta ask how to angle lock angles of the outer shell of a heli without exposed/filling the room with locks, tryna make a transport heli and currently dying with angles and window lines
general 2023-04-10 04:33:26 motor/anglelocking is extremely easy, take 3 blocks and squish em to make funky angles or to glitch and hide blocks together
general 2023-04-10 04:35:09 never cam locked before
general 2023-04-10 04:35:25 hol up gotta find a tut i aint know

creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:13:57 i mean yeah you could say that but if you walked around with the symbol in a jewish area with a sign saying that is was peaceful would you be suprised to be kicked out
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:16:06 well yeah but im just sayin people who say that are kinda stupid because well after a funny mustache man i dont think the meaning is the same at all
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:22:02 im not gonna say im offended by it but you cant really say the windmill isnt offensive because after a very popular austrian commited mass genocide with that symbol it kinda out weights the "peace" part of it
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:24:04 if your gonna go anywhere and protest the bad meaning of the windmill hope you know most people are gonna think your a na*i because well it caused MASS GENOCIDE and IS NOT A PEACE SYMBOL
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:29:09 you cant use the cultural excuse because IT KILLED 7 MILLION PEOPLE, its just a bit beyond having culture save it after the war it caused killed over 20 MILLION PEOPLE, it aint  a good symbol you dunce
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:32:01 i still do, that build was ass did you delete that shitty ukraine heli?
also <@989353863695966209> it doesnt matter imagine if the pope caused mass genocide that led to the deaths of around 30 million total, people wouldnt want to be christian because the would be associated with THE PEOPLE WHOLE KILLED AROUND 30 MILLION PEOPLE
<@584060481522761728> just a reference francis aint do nun actually he cant really do nothing too old but anyways
