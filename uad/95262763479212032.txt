creations-chat 2020-05-16 21:35:26 Does anyone have any tips on how to reduce the lag of a 2k+ build?
creations-chat 2020-05-16 21:38:28 the computer isnt the problem, it just moves slower in general, even if recorded speed is the same
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 21:44:15 my millenium falcon's hyperdrive is working

general 2020-05-16 23:38:39 How are some of the posts in the HoF bigger than the plots? like, too big to be unfolded bigger
general 2020-05-16 23:45:25 not totally convinced that purifiedwater14's "Collab build ship" fits lol
general 2020-05-16 23:47:58 <@!162156549978980352> oh so its made using multiple people's plots?
general 2020-05-16 23:48:50 Ah, would have been more helpful without the attitude ðŸ˜‰

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:38:22 having 2 motors in a mirrored build and one of them will always end up different to the other
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:38:31 out of sync

general 2020-05-17 11:10:14 I remember roblox not having a mobile...
general 2020-05-17 11:10:45 I'm afraid my account might be one of the oldest here lol
general 2020-05-17 11:10:54 My hat is older than most of the players

general 2020-05-17 11:11:48 Not really lol
general 2020-05-17 11:12:12 I wish I could recover the accounts I had before CheeseJuggernaut became my standard
general 2020-05-17 11:12:31 My accounts get older but I never made a memorable username :(
general 2020-05-17 11:12:47 That's why I've used cheesejuggernaut since 2009
general 2020-05-17 11:13:04 Is it possible to request a username change?
general 2020-05-17 11:13:22 Oh nice
general 2020-05-17 11:13:38 Remember the OG ultimate paintball :D

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 14:00:45 what does max torque do on motors?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 14:01:12 does it just make it less likely to give into resistance?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 14:01:29 or does it change acceleration to max speed

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:36:07 What are outlines? Why they gone?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:40:53 Does this refer to the outlines around each block that make each one visible or some other outline that I'm not aware of
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:42:16 Ah I see, thanks. Wasnt easy to see on mobile and roblox has already changed so much from when I use to play aha
general 2020-05-21 19:40:50 <@!304977711988867072> Did you complete it? I always seem to get about 2/3 of the way before my only move is to guess...
general 2020-05-21 19:47:36 same
general 2020-05-21 19:47:53 if its a time competition, I think it would be ok to lower the number of bombs
general 2020-05-21 19:54:29 <@!304977711988867072> ðŸ˜¦
general 2020-05-21 19:55:02 seen't'nt

general 2020-05-21 20:01:26 beat 24 ðŸ˜‰
general 2020-05-21 20:19:21 attach locked motors to tilt before takeoff
general 2020-05-21 20:22:18 what is meant to generate lift
general 2020-05-21 20:22:41 those wings are probably in the wrong orientation, but I dont really know what that is so idk
general 2020-05-21 23:05:40 you havent missed it
general 2020-05-21 23:05:43 you can still play
general 2020-05-21 23:05:59 bombs are too high so its mostly down to luck
general 2020-05-21 23:06:15 minesweeper isnt always solvable smh
general 2020-05-22 02:36:18 <:shh:528142592479723520>

general 2020-05-22 02:51:35 <@!216193164199985152> I think when it gets down to this low a time, its mostly luck. want to settle this 1v1 for the crown another way?
general 2020-05-22 02:52:22 smart choice
general 2020-05-22 02:52:32

general 2020-06-14 19:10:53 Why to creations have a down vote as well as an up vote? Wouldn't it make more sense just to have the up vote button, and you simply dont upvote if you dont like it?
general 2020-06-14 19:12:01 The downvote button just promotes people manipulating the voting system by down voting other people to make themselves look better, doesnt it?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:37:01 Hey its been a while since I played, have unfolding builds been broken in the last year?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:37:23 I try to unfold my build but it just snaps back to the original position
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:38:33 
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:38:50 I try to put the nose down but it just snaps back up
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:38:54 no idea whats going on
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 17:40:34 this worked, thanks!
