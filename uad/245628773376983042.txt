The Tale of Eclipsis (245628773376983042)
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 19:24:29 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 19:24:42 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 19:24:59 Anyway, is there a way to make a tracks system?
help 2019-01-06 19:25:56 Is there a way to create a tracked vehicle system in the game? (Ping me afterwards)
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:27:38 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:27:39 Trying
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:27:42 To think on something
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:27:49 Would there be any way to make something like a turret?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:27:54 To spin with a gunner
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:06 A spinning turret anyway
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:08 Doesn't need a gunner
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:24 Control able within reason?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:48 Sounds good
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:56 In pvp mode can you aim the guns?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:28:59 Or how do they work?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:29:28 Really annoying that half blocks count as a full block :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:29:42 For me they do
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:29:43 :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:29:59 Yeah I'm fairly new
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:30:40 Nevermind I'm wrong
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:30:47 :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:30:51 oh well
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:34:02 Now to figure out how motor's work
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:34:03 Hehe
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:38:55 What's torgue for on motor?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:06 Torque*
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:19 danke
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:33 I know that
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:36 I just don't know what it does.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:52 Or I can ask more experienced players.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:39:55 As a new player does.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:40:32 Fair enough.
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 20:40:46 Yeah what is it with you putting h?
help 2019-01-09 18:50:53 Dumb question, but how do you unanchor something, I'm trying to  use a slide for a piston but it keeps anchoring to my main vehicle.
help 2019-01-09 18:52:56 What I mean is that my piston tries to push the whole vehicle
help 2019-01-09 18:52:58 ANd of course
help 2019-01-09 18:53:00 That doesn't work
help 2019-01-09 18:53:07 So how would I make a tight slide
creations-chat 2019-01-10 19:46:14 <@!256501003493441547> you should add explosives inside of it so when it falls over you can make it blow up lol
creations-chat 2019-01-10 19:46:18 (Your AT-AT)
creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:11:47 I call it the meme mobile, it was made to try and reach a certain amount of SPS, I think it worked (although it is somewhat cheating)
help 2019-01-12 13:31:32 Would this count as a VTOL, its wings and engines can tilt upwards allowing for vertical takeoff
help 2019-01-12 13:33:14 It's a very strange VTOL
help 2019-01-12 13:33:16 Somehow it flies
help 2019-01-12 13:34:58 
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:17:04 Jesus christ mte.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:17:06 Mate
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:17:28 "Not trying to be mean", what is this, a world where everyone's feeling smatter?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:17:48 Feelings, matter
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:17:52 Typo.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:18:29 <@!385247005003218948> Aren't we talking about the moderation team of "Plane crazy"?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:18:33 Get a grip
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:18:59 When a verified tries to enforce the rules.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:19:04 When he hsa no power to do so.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:19:08 Has*
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:19:58 There should still be an element of professionalism, vip.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:21:33 Is this a rubicks cube Point>
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:21:34 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:22:55 oboi
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:23:07 I was born when time began
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:23:09 Get rekt
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:23:11 Older than u
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:34:27 I will turn your cat into a dog
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 19:29:17 Incorrect my friend.
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 19:29:21 Rule Britannia
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 08:53:05 Y'all is there any form of full block that does not connect with other blocks (e.g. so that I can make a sliding cockpit roof which is airtight.)
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 08:53:18 Can't really explain it easily
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:45:47 If the winter gear was actually any use :/
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:46:51 :/
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:46:57 Has anyone actually found a means to put them to use?
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:13 The ski stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:43 Which makes them near useless for the most part
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:48:28 I never got winter wheels or snow blaster
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:19:40 Is there any way to prevent two blocks from colliding
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:19:43 I want to make a sliding door
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:20:03 But of course it keeps attaching to the actual frame of the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:20:07 Not carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:21:02 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:21:05 Cheers mate
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:15:43 Yeet
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:01 so what's the shutdown?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:20 I established it was an update
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:43 REEEEEEEEEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:08 Roblox when they copy the patreon logo
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:34 Pinterest*
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:54 Pft
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:53:00 Was a photo mode really worth a shutdown?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:53:25 F
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:58:48 *me waiting for an update where you can drag with the delete thing so you don't have to click each thing manually*
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:02:54 Hmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:02:59 Probably shouldn't say that aloud
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:26:26 I'm experiencing delays when I press play and sometimes my physics don't kick in, so overall my vehicle won't work, are you guys experiencing this as well>?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:26:53 It's a bit annoyin'
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:27:30 That too
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:27:37 Things that fly in non-pvp don't fly in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:28:00 On the bright side, I've just finished building a working railgun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:28:16 :)
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:29:54 O so it has been done before
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:29:56 I expected so
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:30:12 I made a bomber feeding mechanism, has that been made before?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:32:26 When you want to be big brain but you know you'll never be big brain XD
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:33:58 Motors and pistons are still pretty broke
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:37 And now I have another issue
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:38 :/
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:43 My motors randomly go out of sync
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:58 Not even after touching anything just completely randomly
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:46:26 :/
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:47:01 Only four things I've built out of the full save slots I have actually work consistently lol
creations-chat 2019-08-21 17:58:29 Behold the reason why my parents wanted me adopted, the battle barge
creations-chat 2019-08-21 17:58:49 
creations-chat 2019-08-21 17:59:24 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:00:40 If you look in creations you will never wonder why my parents wanted me adopted
creations-chat 2019-08-21 18:03:03 XD
creations-chat 2019-08-21 18:03:10 Better than the battle bus amirite
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 09:40:24 I'm getting a bug where there's an invisible part that I can't delete, any solutions?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 09:42:15 Going for the crazy engineer achievement
general 2019-12-03 10:28:55 It's not Christmas yet reee
creations-chat 2019-12-04 18:53:52 Elysian Dawn- Combat variant, can carry 6 people and armed with concealed rockets and guns underneath, not many fancy features except pistons are used to open the door (which also happens to be the engines)
creations-chat 2019-12-04 18:56:25 Only 300 blocks, turns amazingly though
creations-chat 2019-12-04 19:00:46 Shrike, pretty common design on plane crazy but good for flying with.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 13:30:07 Ikr
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 13:30:27 Stop adding changes nobody asked for reee
