plane-crazy 2018-11-07 07:49:31 I think so, but neither does the default ones
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 07:50:00 The default ones kinda change their hue and shade after reloading it in
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 07:50:42 Yeah, that happens to me too
creations-chat 2018-11-17 09:30:54 Airship
creations-chat 2018-11-17 09:31:49 Altough this pic is slighlty outdated now because i added like 6 more rockets for steering
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 09:44:36 Hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 09:44:57 Maybe you need a better thingy in the back
creations-chat 2018-11-17 10:40:48 Upgraded Airship
creations-chat 2018-11-17 10:41:27 Hmmmm, i picked a bad spot for this screenshot
creations-chat 2018-11-17 10:44:06 Thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:49:45 Lol, some dude's copying my airship all the way to the color scheme without knowing how it works XD
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:50:47 Lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:50:52 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:51:08 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:51:53 Also i love how this kid has no idea how my airship works but still tried to make a block for block copy of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:52:45 I have max friends, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:55:12 I dunno really
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:00:40 I somehow walked off the map while reading messages lol
creations-chat 2018-11-17 16:55:47 Now that's cool
creations-chat 2018-11-17 16:56:04 Does it have more hidden weapons than just the rockets?
creations-chat 2018-11-17 20:27:07 Airship V3
creations-chat 2018-11-17 20:27:31 I plan to get this thing to 500 blocks at some point
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:34:41 Lol some kid was trying to copy my airship again
creations-chat 2018-11-23 16:10:32 A Bird Mech that can make small body gestures
creations-chat 2018-11-23 16:11:16 Stuff like in the pic below, it can flap it's wings and it can tilt it's head
creations-chat 2018-11-23 16:11:28 Also yes i reused my airship color scheme, fight me
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 16:17:54 I honestly hate people who steal ideas and aren't even subtle about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 16:18:13 Like that bird mech i made and some asshole tried to copy it lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:18:23 Literally the most advanced thing i've ever been able to make is a bird mech that can flap it's wings to hover
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:18:27 That's literally it
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:19:08 I actually gave the wings a function on accident lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:19:33 I didn't think i could actually do something by flapping them
creations-chat 2018-11-24 15:07:26 Improved Bird Mech
creations-chat 2018-11-24 15:07:40 It can flap it's wings to hover
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 20:51:32 It's funny how quickly you can learn in this game after making a basic airplane
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:47:37 Oh sweet, a night time mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 10:01:32 Alvin when you join the game it spawns your auto save build, you need to load your save slot
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 10:14:46 I love this bird
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 18:22:14 F
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:02:14 Huh, seems like one of the updates broke my bird mech
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:02:28 It's wings don't flap normally anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:03:10 Okay, looks like i have to stumble around to figure out how torque works
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:03:16 Fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:12:26 Hey does anyone know how i can fix my bird mech with this torque update?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:12:51 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:13:10 It's that the wings flap inconsistently
