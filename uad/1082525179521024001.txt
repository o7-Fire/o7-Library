general 2023-05-06 14:09:39 Castles

creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:21:42 question (about boats)
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:35:23 off topic question, how can i stop my boats from splitting when folded and moving? im gonna make a submission to try and get rank V shipwright and thats my only issue rn
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:37:59 should i use cameras to help it stay level?? i think i actually know but im not sure, i use cameras on the front two parts and should i use it on the back two folds as well? (and can someone join a server with me maybe to see what i mean i dont have perms yet) (oh ok, but yeah no my boat has 4 folds, last one is for a little extra length to make it less awkward)
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:40:32 question though, what does it mean on shipwright V i need 20 score? i have 4376 blocks on it but idk what the score means
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:06:57 Sorry I have to ask again, how can you avoid splitting on larger boats?
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:21:46 My boat folds in four places and 2 on top 2 on bottom, it splits a little when they meet
creations-chat 2023-06-16 20:47:31 No like I mean it also doesn’t fold all the way, I’ll do that but I didn’t mean it like that sorry I wasn’t clear
