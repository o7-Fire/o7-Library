plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:44:12 i had to pretty much just end a build since pistons ruined it and i needed them <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:48:24 pistons made the main point of the build not work, but i needed them for part of that thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:50:39 https://medal.tv/clips/56280015/d1337I5eQYgd this was supposed to be pushed up and be locked in a 30 degree angle, but it became wobbly cus os the pistons
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:51:14 nothing worked, the problem was the pistons
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:52:31 actually you have a really solid point
