general 2022-07-23 18:34:12 Nah I mean in general alot of people that play this game are toxic
general 2022-07-23 18:37:43 imagine being British ( rookie mistake )
general 2022-07-23 18:38:08 Take me to brazil
general 2022-07-23 18:38:28 Yes
the-dump 2022-07-25 22:10:23 with some fixing you'd have a pretty sweet jeep
the-dump 2022-07-25 22:11:27 yeah that happens
general 2023-03-24 09:54:13 Bruh I ran out of goddamn wedges how do I continue my build now
general 2023-03-24 09:54:22 Why is there a limit on blocks you can use that's so dumb
general 2023-03-24 09:54:43 It doesn't have a material
general 2023-03-24 09:54:58 It doesnt
general 2023-03-24 09:55:18 Yeah then set a limit to those ones
general 2023-03-24 09:55:26 But not normal blocks and wedges that's ridiculous
general 2023-03-24 09:55:58 It's DEFAULT
general 2023-03-24 09:56:15 1x1
general 2023-03-24 09:56:36 Wait what
general 2023-03-24 09:57:15 Well damn thanks
general 2023-03-24 09:57:26 Will ice affect my build
general 2023-03-24 09:58:07 Oh right
general 2023-03-24 09:58:23 Wait no
general 2023-03-24 09:58:32 That's way too complicated for me ðŸ’€
general 2023-03-24 09:58:37 I'll just use ice wedges
general 2023-03-24 09:59:03 Nah I just go outside
general 2023-03-24 09:59:17 I appreciate you
general 2023-03-24 10:03:56 I'm such a genius
general 2023-03-24 10:04:23 I just built the rest with ice wedges and then simply paint bucketed the whole thing with the default material
general 2023-03-24 10:04:47 think smarter not harder ðŸ¤“
