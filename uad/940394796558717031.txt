creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:33:14 so what about it is ass? i would like to fix the issues with it that i at the time was unable to think of any others than the paint job which i will work on, that is why i posted it

creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:36:57 okay, i'll go with you're too lazy to give me feedback on how i could improve it, i deeply apologize if i have caused you any pain from seeing my horrendous build, have a great rest of your day
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:39:37 as i have previously said, i am aware of this and im working on this build to improve it with said feedback. 
(also, side note, <@781989929076523009>, you aren't hard *nor* funny)
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:41:42 further proves my point to the fact that you're lazy
