general 2022-06-29 16:03:16 my control surfaces
general 2022-06-29 16:03:28 will just invert their mouse controls
general 2022-06-29 16:04:05 HOW DO I FIX THIS
general 2022-06-29 16:04:07 OH MY GOD
general 2022-06-29 16:04:11 MY CONTROL SURFACES
general 2022-06-29 16:04:18 KEEP INVERTING THEIR CONTROLS ON THEIR OWN
general 2022-06-29 16:05:29 que?
general 2022-06-29 16:06:17 there is no uninvert
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 11:59:37 why do i lag so much whenever i touch water in the game?
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:01:47 I lag like crazy whenever I touch water in game.
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:06:48 how do i fix it
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:12:16 bruh i built such a banger boat tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:12:25 i made an italian ww2 destroyer
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:12:30 and i can't set foot in water
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:12:32 without frying my computer
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:12:45 starting to think someone injected lag scripts into the game
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 12:14:08 plane
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:56:01 my build is 2000.....
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:59:25 well ig my destroyer flies now
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:59:33 water is too uninhabitable
bug-reports 2022-07-03 16:57:25 Whenever I make a plane now, the control surfaces invert so the top of my monitor makes the plane go down when it should be the opposite.
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:44:02 how do i fix this
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:47:04 I fixed it by using control surface 1x1 instead of 1x2
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:51:59 No it is a glitch
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:52:05 I just fixed it then it happened again
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:56:04 I have to keep replacing my control surfaces every time i want to fly
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:35:35 My build is missing loads of standard 1x1x1 blocks and apparently I reached my block cap. But water is less laggy when I spawn my build in. I had to replace tons of stuff with 1x0.9 blocks.
general 2022-08-13 12:51:23 should planecrazy 2 have come out by now?
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 21:42:24 Where in the world is the vertical stabiliser?
