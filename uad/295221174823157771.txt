plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:32:54 Ello
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:33:10 You guys know SpiritGamers plane

plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:33:26 Well he submitted it
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:33:36 And it was actually my plane lol and the landing gear too.
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:34:29 oof but it got downvoted lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:34:32 Oof to me then
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:34:47 Guy with the jet on the right is me
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:35:01 I could send it, but like
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 04:35:04 Prototype
plane-crazy 2020-01-04 04:01:01 add L block
plane-crazy 2020-01-04 04:01:05 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:04:48 Anyone able to help me power this bruh
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:09 mm ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:15 Cuz super engines too weak
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:24 Conveyor drives are unbalanced
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:28 and magnets too
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:36 so
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:48 for conveyor drives to work good on big aircraft (from my experience)
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:52 they have to be in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:00 well the bomb bay is in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:19 and putting the conveyor drive in the back makes the plane spin in maneuvers
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:25 I guess yeah Penski
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:29 I tried that
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:35 But they somehow overpower one each other
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:48 If you pitch down the front conveyor will overpower
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:54 Same thing vice versa
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:57 ye
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:07:40 oh also with conveyor drives for some reason when you use control surfaces they keep the momentum so you can make something spin like a beyblade
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:08:06 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:08:18 yea
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:08:24 that would be the solution
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:08:33 here imma send a pic of the bay
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:09:39 
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:10:29 so yee
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:11:06 ok lemme see
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:11:52 oh btw is the center of the conveyor drive, like where the power is the conveyor?
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:11:59 so if its 5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:05 the conveyor would be on the 3rd block
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:19 yea
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:22 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:28 well imma try to put a conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:33 and not fill the bay
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:12:35 ty
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:13:45 Bruh, when a bus drives through a makeup store.
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:14:21 if owner is see text plz no kill life of me
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:13 mm bruh
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:18 so I got the conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:21 but uh
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:27 THE MANEUVERS
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:38 is like if you roll right
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:17:49 it goes right then starts spinning like a beyblade
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:18:09 <:Wack:559530123284578326>

help 2020-04-09 18:15:51 I got a conveyor engine on me Su-57. Makes it wobble instead of a stable flight
help 2020-04-09 18:15:56 Using custom control panels
help 2020-04-09 18:16:35 that's the thing I don't know
help 2020-04-09 18:16:37 It wobbles
help 2020-04-09 18:16:41 so it loses and gains speed
help 2020-04-09 18:16:50 yea
help 2020-04-09 18:16:56 but when I put it lower than 5
help 2020-04-09 18:16:59 it just doesn't take off
help 2020-04-09 18:17:33 does it matter where the conveyor engine is placed relative to the center of gravity or  flight?
help 2020-04-09 18:18:55 hmm
help 2020-04-09 18:27:03 frick
help 2020-04-09 18:27:08 conveyor still doesn't work
help 2020-04-09 18:27:29 it's behind the center of gravity, and in front of the center of flight
help 2020-04-09 18:27:36 still wobbles
help 2020-04-09 18:27:47 used motors, suspension, springs, and pistons
help 2020-04-09 18:27:59 yes
help 2020-04-09 18:28:06 Maybe because it's a Sukhoi
help 2020-04-09 18:28:28 The plane isn't fully straight and could probably have something to do with that?
help 2020-04-09 18:28:33 Su-57

help 2020-04-09 18:51:47 
help 2020-04-09 18:51:57 it's literally just a motor
help 2020-04-09 18:52:00 with a conveyor
help 2020-04-09 18:52:13 I built a test plane with it and it was stable. Used a speed of 5
help 2020-04-09 18:52:17 well yea
help 2020-04-09 18:52:25 Put supers on the plane
help 2020-04-09 18:52:27 it works
help 2020-04-09 18:52:47 Center of gravity?
help 2020-04-09 18:52:52 Or just the center of the plane
help 2020-04-09 18:53:08 mkay Imma try it
help 2020-04-09 18:55:37 yea no
help 2020-04-09 18:56:04 It just wobbles a little, then it starts to get worse.
help 2020-04-09 19:14:23 goes 500
help 2020-04-09 19:14:27 it's a big plane too
help 2020-04-09 19:29:44 wobbblleeee

help 2020-04-09 19:38:56 also got an abnormal wobble on me plane
help 2020-04-09 19:38:58 Very weird
help 2020-04-09 19:39:10 I got a conveyor engine tested and super rockets tested
help 2020-04-09 19:39:14 they both go the same speed
help 2020-04-09 19:39:24 but the super rockets have no wobble to the plane
help 2020-04-09 19:39:30 and the conveyor engine does
help 2020-04-09 19:39:36 tested seperately
help 2020-04-09 19:40:22 eh do conveyor engines get speed when something is hit???
help 2020-04-09 19:40:53 wth so my plane is the only one
help 2020-04-09 19:41:12 I put one then it hit the island and started gaining speed like hek
