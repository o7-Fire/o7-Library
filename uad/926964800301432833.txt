creations-chat 2022-05-19 12:45:32 just rename it to mig 31 B)
almost same plane visually but it has guns (does not carry 500 kg missile though)
general 2022-06-14 13:54:03 <@953888267609194496> you have 2 fathers
general 2022-06-18 17:36:52 lol asian people
general 2022-06-18 17:37:57 asian people:
general 2022-06-18 17:38:01 higher
general 2022-06-18 17:38:06 for what?
general 2022-06-18 17:38:16 no its like significantly below
general 2022-06-18 17:39:03 nicer being taller
general 2022-06-18 17:39:54 182
general 2022-06-18 17:40:56 184 isnt crazy tall, that is really common
general 2022-06-18 17:41:05 therefore expected
general 2022-06-18 17:41:18 i dont know anybody my age 1.4
general 2022-06-18 17:41:24 not even my ph friend
general 2022-06-18 17:43:09 how can you say that 'being tall is worse' when you are literally 5'4 and have never experienced it
general 2022-06-18 17:43:30 i think i stopped playing in 20 or 21
general 2022-06-18 17:44:29 i see no downsides to being like 6'0-6'3 aside from not being as comfortable in cars that you cant afford
general 2022-06-18 17:44:53 most motorcycles assume that you are 6'0 too
general 2022-06-18 17:45:42 (white name)
general 2022-06-18 17:46:00 if you live in asia maybe, luckily i live in europe
general 2022-06-18 17:46:55 dude, i have a 1.8 meter tall crane model *standing on my desk* with no problem
general 2022-06-18 17:47:53 why would your knees break from being too tall? i have literally never heard of that happening
general 2022-06-18 17:48:10 my dad who is 6'3 has never had knee issues
general 2022-06-18 17:48:29 damage then
general 2022-06-18 17:48:35 exactly
general 2022-06-18 17:48:49 you wont?
general 2022-06-18 17:49:27 my knees feel the same as they did when i was 6, height has no effect
general 2022-06-18 17:49:43 i think you are confusing tall people with incredibly obese people
general 2022-06-18 17:50:13 you are just coping then
general 2022-06-18 17:50:22 there are no disadvantages to being 6'0
general 2022-06-18 17:50:37 it only gets bad when you are like 6'4+
general 2022-06-18 17:51:39 oh yeah? go grab the tea kettle on top of the shelf ðŸ˜Ž
general 2022-06-18 17:52:26 standing on your toes can only do so much
general 2022-06-18 17:52:48 im fairly average 14 year old height (5'10) and still have to stand on my toes to reach shit
general 2022-06-18 17:53:09 denmark
general 2022-06-18 17:53:18 in denmark it is
general 2022-06-18 17:53:26 you appear to be american
general 2022-06-18 17:54:43 the only people my age i know that are within that are short girls
general 2022-06-18 17:55:06 my ph friend is 5'0 ðŸ’€
general 2022-06-18 17:55:10 iirc its 5'2 average
general 2022-06-18 17:57:33 those games are kind of boring
general 2022-06-18 17:57:51 wings of glory and plane crazy best games
general 2022-06-18 17:57:57 without the racing though
general 2022-06-18 17:58:05 hotlap only

general 2022-06-18 18:02:37 they are posting pics of new cars but i have been waiting for the gt3 update for literally 23 months and 25 days
general 2022-06-18 18:07:44 that doesnt take 2 years to model and map 6 low poly roblox cars
general 2022-06-18 18:08:45 not even beamng is that slow, and they actually have to model the entire car and then model it again for the physics engine and a million other things
general 2022-06-18 18:09:43 they just make their own revloops, they only have to make like 5 im pretty sure, beamng does literally like 30
general 2022-06-18 18:10:22 i have literally my self made more than 6 cars in the time that has passed from when they first teased it
general 2022-06-18 18:10:33 ((on old corrupted drive))

creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:17:54 idk if anybody else sees it
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:25:28 i didnt make it, also i said that it looked like the 682 if it was morphed into a dinosaur, not that it looked like "normal" 682
