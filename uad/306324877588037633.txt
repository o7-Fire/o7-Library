The Tale of ibu422 (306324877588037633)
bug-reports 2020-04-12 07:06:47 ive noticed that every now and then, when you go into "fly" mode and come back to build mode, it wont allow you to choose the build menu or the edit menu. youll just be stuck on the build menu without being able to choose any subsection (thrusters, wings etc) or place any blocks
bug-reports 2020-04-12 07:07:21 id post evidence, but its kinda just me standing there jiggling my mouse
creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:19:21 we need attachers instead of detachers
bug-reports 2020-10-13 07:11:00 cant get a screenshot for this, but everytime i use motor 2's for massive turrets they allways wobble around massively, instead of snapping right to where my mouse is. sometimes if the build is too big, it gets into an infininte loop of spining in a circle
creations-chat 2020-10-13 07:32:55 my newest creation

bug-reports 2020-12-14 10:41:17 i cant really show a pic of this, but i cant sprint, open settings, or see through my own blocks in fly mode

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 11:32:56 its my only effective anti-shredder swarm... device
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 11:33:01 the only problem with it
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 11:33:13 is that, clearly, it swats away more than just shredders

creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:04:08 should i spend 5 hours adding wedges to my meat "man"

or is it good enough with only blocks for its main body (the spikes are wedges)

<@!464634048279478282> but h o w
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:07:18 how would i "smooth" out parts like this? i don't think using corner wedges/ corner wedge blocks will do the trick alone, and that's as far as my smoothing knowledge goes for things of this scale
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:13:18 i wedged a small portion

i guess its ***S L I G H T L Y*** less blocky, but i still don't know if I want to wedge the whole thing
