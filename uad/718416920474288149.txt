help 2022-10-30 22:05:24 late but yknow you can just use half cylinders you dont gotta use full cylinders and motorlock them and i dont think you can really transition front those cylinders unless you do angle lock
help 2022-10-30 22:06:00 but then the angle lock will probably use piston lock and stuff
help 2022-10-31 11:58:38 plane crazy being weird thats my only explaination

creations-chat 2022-12-04 13:40:11 i appreciate the effort but it looks nothing like an f35
creations-chat 2022-12-04 13:47:27 no because motor 2 is weird
help 2022-12-04 16:49:48 use angle lock for the nose

creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:47:02 this is what a su 75 checkmate looks like ok ur build looks more like an f35 tbh
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:55:08 anyways the su 75 seems to have elevons instead of elevators
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:02:11 <@568036773750505502> looking at ur tomcat it seems like its a bit inaccurate in some areas

canopy is a weird mess, some parts should be glass and it seems like there is exposed motorlock, you can try to place the motorlock closer to the tower

intakes are blocky too, they should be angled like in this reference pic below

and finally there should be a tail thing in the area between the engines sticking out
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:05:13 its unfixable but you can atleast improve it a bit surely right <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 20:09:19 pog

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:39:54 i dmed you
creations-chat 2022-12-06 20:26:49 imo the greatest plane is the wright flyer because you see planes wouldn't exist without the wright flyer existing
creations-chat 2022-12-06 20:29:52 but you see that would mean that planes would possibly be designed differently so we probably wouldn't have the f35 if another guy invented it
creations-chat 2022-12-06 20:41:33 its still very influential though like with the wright flyer being made we can now bomb kids in afghanistan whenever we want to

bug-reports 2022-12-26 01:51:27 b what
bug-reports 2022-12-26 01:51:38 is it repeatedly happening
bug-reports 2022-12-26 01:52:34 this is just a guess but its probably because the small landing gear is holding too much weight
bug-reports 2022-12-26 01:56:45 what if you like

in your custom jet they are 1 block tall and wide and are just really boring plus there isn't any depth to it

creations-chat 2023-01-05 21:22:43 to be fr you should make the space between the thrusters 3 blocks and make it more like the first image

fix the goofy ahh gap as shown in the second image

tldr: DELETE IT, NOW!!!!!

creations-chat 2023-01-05 21:40:37 the thrusters in the first pic seem to be around 2 blocks wide so going with that knowledge that would be that 1 and a half thrusters would fit the engine gaps and 2 x 1 and 1/2 is 3 so the gap is 3 blocks wide

the thruster gap in his f14 is 2 blocks
creations-chat 2023-01-05 21:44:11 it is solid 3 blocks wide plus piston lock exists

creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:15:19 focus on making it smaller but also like you can use trails and crap to add the details on the windows (motorlocked ofc)
