help 2022-10-10 22:07:23 so basically i tried making this at at, it's not done yet. the way it walks is.. questionable. i need help cause i desperately want this finished. the way it walk is that it uses "W" to make the frent left and back right leg to go forwards, then "S" to make the back left and front right move forwards. it literally moonwalks, stays in one place, and turns left at the same time. please help ðŸ’€https://streamable.com/rb5s11
