general 2022-08-27 16:46:27 can someone help me make my build with 7k blocks fly/float? it is not symmetrical so it is very hard to find its center point, plus it is a 3 fold.
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 18:55:13 can someone help me make my build with 7k blocks float, fly?
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 23:19:13 Very handsome man.
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 23:22:11 Can someone tell me if it’s possible to make something with 7k blocks fly stable?
general 2022-08-27 23:23:56 Do hoverdrives allow stable flight with really large builds? Like three fold type.
general 2022-08-27 23:24:48 How big does the hoverdrive have to be for 7k blocks?
help 2022-08-27 23:25:43 If someone could tell me how I can make my 7k block, non symmetrical build fly, that would be great.
help 2022-08-27 23:26:18 I can’t rn since I’m busy, maybe in like an hour?
help 2022-08-27 23:26:30 Actually, I might have it on iCloud.
general 2022-08-27 23:29:22 Can I put it anywhere in my build? Or does it have to be in a specific location.
general 2022-08-27 23:29:41 Wdym
general 2022-08-27 23:30:16 Ohhh, I mean a hoverdrive that will keep my ship stable in the air
general 2022-08-27 23:31:30 Dang, is there any other way to have my ship fly without it tumbling all over the place?
general 2022-08-27 23:31:46 Cause rn I got helium blocks, which make it super light, but it likes to role
general 2022-08-27 23:32:11 Yeah, I’m trying to do it without 0 grav.
general 2022-08-27 23:32:37 Yeah
general 2022-08-27 23:33:03 The problem is that my build isn’t symmetrical so it makes it really hard to place stuff in the right spot
general 2022-08-27 23:33:51 I heard that if I use springs, wing surface, and hoverdrive then you can have your build float in the air much higher.
help 2022-08-27 23:34:36 Yeah, well it’s not supposed to fly like an airplane.
help 2022-08-27 23:34:41 It’s a helicarrier
help 2022-08-27 23:36:41 So I guess I’ll just experiment with helium blocks until it floats evenly.
general 2022-08-29 03:40:05 how do you get something into the hall of fame?
general 2022-08-29 03:40:33 do you think i could get my avengers helicarrier in?
general 2022-08-29 03:40:49 its 8k blocks
general 2022-08-29 03:40:58 xd ok
general 2022-08-29 03:41:12 why? im guessing it has to be custom, yeah?
general 2022-08-29 03:41:31 i cant since i dont have image perms yet
general 2022-08-29 03:41:49 ok
general 2022-08-29 03:42:48 cute
general 2022-08-29 03:44:04 whats wrong with it?
general 2022-08-29 03:45:19 but whats wrong with it
general 2022-08-29 03:47:02 yeah, i would have added better runway markings, but i intend for it to be functional, so i had to paint them on
general 2022-08-29 03:47:54 ok
general 2022-08-29 03:48:19 i managed to make it fly, is that an achievement? (without 0G)
general 2022-08-29 03:48:56 no not really since that has a much different style to it.
general 2022-08-29 05:16:05 my mess hall in my helicarrier is small, so i named it mess room
general 2022-08-29 05:16:08 xd
general 2022-08-29 05:16:54 whats better, bigger hangar? or bigger features, like sleeping quarters, command room, bathroom etc
general 2022-08-29 05:31:54 yay my helicarrier has officially reached 8k blocks
general 2022-08-29 17:20:27 whats worse, building upside down, or motorlocking an entire 5k block build
general 2022-08-29 17:21:10 dang bruh
general 2022-08-29 17:22:51 yeah but its easy to mess up, like building runway markings on two pieces that have to fold together or something
general 2022-08-29 17:24:22 how can you make spaceships fly without 0g
general 2022-08-29 17:24:45 like sometimes itt looks like they are using 0g but they float perfectly with out
general 2022-08-29 17:24:50 and they dont tumble around
general 2022-08-29 17:25:20 xd yeah sounds about right
general 2022-08-29 17:25:49 it looks nice
general 2022-08-29 17:27:12 for vtol planes to be balanced, does the whole plane have to be symmetrical?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:21:25 well you can go faster
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:21:29 using helium blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:21:41 i dont care
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:21:44 : D
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:22:46 that would break some physical laws
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:23:07 you cant go against physics
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:23:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 03:23:14 its roblox
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 05:00:16 MY HELICARRIER CAN NOW FLY WITHOUT TIPPING OVER wooooo!

plane-crazy 2022-09-01 17:15:12 looks like poppy first glance lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-01 17:15:40 xd
creations-chat 2022-09-03 01:10:31 I think the re-entry vehicle for that is pretty dang cool.
general 2022-09-03 18:28:03 Is it possible to make tracks for a medium sized tank?
general 2022-09-03 18:28:44 If there were smaller motors than maybe it could work?

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 18:20:57 i think it would be cool to make a 16 inch gun and the entire turret, 1:1 scale in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-09-19 21:48:00 I just play plane crazy for fun.
help 2022-09-19 21:50:43 Delete it, nah jk, functioning taillights would be cool.
creations-chat 2022-09-19 21:52:29 Looks like your the minority, since most of the people who saw it thought it was nice.
creations-chat 2022-09-20 02:46:46 <@718224997570838641> i like your little mechanical build, nice to see some of that in plane crazy rather than just planes planes and more planes lol.
creations-chat 2022-09-20 02:53:30 exactly, i see to many people trying to fine detail planes and stuff like that, honestly it gets a little boring to see, not very interesting. Bigger, bolder, more diverse stuff would be excellent to see.
creations-chat 2022-09-20 03:49:15 super good b-29 keep it up <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-09-22 23:42:44 <@438960075483250688> very cool carrier you built, I would like to know, how did you make those cross beams? They add very nice detail to the underside of the flight deck.
creations-chat 2022-09-23 03:30:14 <@764012050300141569> nice build, but i wouldn't make the lights so bright, dim them down a bit.
help 2022-09-23 03:57:54 anyone know how i can paint this better?
help 2022-09-23 03:59:25 but how should the pattern be?

creations-chat 2022-09-23 22:11:35 yeah, here is another pic. (i hope the ramp proportions are correct)
creations-chat 2022-09-23 22:27:40 Oh, it’s a kuznetsov.
creations-chat 2022-09-24 17:26:44 i thought camera lock wouldnt lock correctly sometimes

creations-chat 2022-09-24 19:59:27 <@456226577798135808> could you dm me those pics you sent like yesterday of the kuznetsov?
creations-chat 2022-09-24 21:30:05 I believe the gun should be a little more to the left (I might be getting confused with the hetzer though)
creations-chat 2022-09-24 21:32:17 Wait no, I think the tracks might be too wide.
help 2022-09-24 22:08:44 is that area a 1x1x1 space?
help 2022-09-24 22:09:15 yes, is it the size of a half wedge?
help 2022-09-24 22:10:01 oh, i dont think you can put anything there then
help 2022-09-24 22:10:19 i dont know if theres a triangular wedge type block that small
help 2022-09-24 22:11:46 how long is it gonna be until it straightens out
help 2022-09-24 22:12:08 oh wait i see it
help 2022-09-24 22:12:22 leme send you a pic of my ship, you can try and copy my style
help 2022-09-24 22:12:55 mine is much more advanced, so yours a different style.
help 2022-09-24 22:13:10 see where the ramp is
help 2022-09-24 22:13:15 its under that
help 2022-09-24 22:13:24 i used various size wedges
help 2022-09-24 22:13:32 you have to expereiment
help 2022-09-24 22:14:04 i dont recommend just putting the same size wedge, put longer ones at top, shorter ones at bottom (for what your doing)
help 2022-09-24 22:14:34 and make sure its symmetrical
help 2022-09-24 23:17:08 yes, but using wedges is the best way to make it smooth without using any locking
help 2022-09-24 23:17:54 yeah
help 2022-09-24 23:18:01 ill give you a good red rgb color code
help 2022-09-24 23:18:04 one second
help 2022-09-25 01:27:23 looks good
help 2022-09-25 02:41:59 what do you guys think of my russian CIWS
help 2022-09-25 02:42:10 
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 02:43:01 russian CIWS
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 02:47:18 : D
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:49:26 i dont think he is
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 02:51:04 idk, looks normal
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 02:51:29 ?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 02:52:44 is that what ever floats your boat?
help 2022-09-25 03:41:49 That’s why I don’t build jets, only boats cause I don’t have to motorlock since it sounds like a boring ass thing to spend time on.
bug-reports 2022-09-25 03:44:17 When I spawn in, sometimes the lettering on my sign gets cut off.
help 2022-09-25 05:56:32 Yeah, but all the builds I’ve done haven’t really required it, I just figure out a way to make it look good enough with out locking. Plus all my builds are very large boats, and since it is much larger, I can make things more rough since all together it blends well. But you are right, I should learn at least a little locking for times when I want to use it.
help 2022-09-25 05:58:53 Haven’t built a warship yet, I focus on carriers. I can imagine it being useful for making rounder turrets and stuff, I’ll look into locking for when I do start runing into more difficult stuff.
help 2022-09-25 19:10:32 how do i make the ramp not just a rectangle (idk how to motor lock)
help 2022-09-25 19:11:01 this is what i tried
help 2022-09-25 19:11:34 i dont know if i can angle it correctly since its so long
creations-chat 2022-09-25 19:14:06 the back of the boat looks a bit funk (the back of the hull that is) Theres a part of it sticking out that doesnt flow well with the rest of the hull, everything else is cool. Try coloring the bridge a different color than the hull.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 19:17:07 well as long as your pleased with it then you should be good.
help 2022-09-25 19:19:21 idk how to angle lock lol
help 2022-09-25 19:19:44 i bet i can find a tutorial on yt or something
help 2022-09-25 19:21:27 wdym by stagger
help 2022-09-25 19:21:53 ohhhh ok
help 2022-09-25 19:22:16 yeah my ramp has the spacing already, ill give it a try, thanks
help 2022-09-25 19:22:59 epic, could i see a pic of it?
help 2022-09-25 19:25:03 very cool, how did you get that runway so smooth?
help 2022-09-25 19:26:09 oh and btw, im just looking to make the runway more triangular, the step ups are gonna stay kinda blocky
help 2022-09-25 19:26:47 so could i apply this to the side of my ramp?
help 2022-09-25 19:27:06 oki
creations-chat 2022-09-26 02:27:55 looks cool bruh
help 2022-09-26 02:29:35 use helium blocks? idk how wide your ship is, that also can have an effect on balance
help 2022-09-26 02:39:54 oh yeah that isnt very wide.
help 2022-09-26 02:40:01 hmmm
help 2022-09-26 02:40:08 remind me what the keel is?
help 2022-09-26 02:40:22 well any width is good, just smaller is harder
help 2022-09-26 02:40:29 oh ok
help 2022-09-26 02:40:48 having a flat bottom to a ship makes it much more stable
help 2022-09-26 02:41:00 but, send me a pic of your hull
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 03:29:26 i want someone to attempt this
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 07:02:55 Make sure you add the 90000mm log on the back for extra extra extra protection <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-09-26 07:03:45 Red log?
creations-chat 2022-09-27 03:01:16 Can someone send me a side pic of the avengers helicarrier? (That shows one side of the hull completely)
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 03:13:32 When the requirement for shipwright v says”must have a score of at least 20” what does that mean?
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 03:14:03 Oh gotcha
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 03:14:35 Ok thx
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 03:20:56 Would you count a helicarrier as vtol?

plane-crazy 2022-09-27 21:34:42 
creations-chat 2022-09-27 21:35:51 thats racist bruh, why more red than white? inequality.
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 21:43:20 should i try painting it different shades of grey?
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 21:43:29 like multiple greys?
help 2022-09-27 22:03:40 nice build you got, using longer angles could help create that shape. but nice job on it so far.
help 2022-09-27 22:05:11 Hulls really dont need to be motorlocked, there are plenty of ways to make something look nice without it, so just follow your gut on what you think is best
help 2022-09-27 23:32:26 2nd one
help 2022-09-27 23:32:33 also use a lighter red maybe?

creations-chat 2022-09-28 23:10:20 yes

help 2022-09-29 00:29:41 goofy ass plane you got there, it looks tail heavy
help 2022-09-29 00:30:20 no worries bruh, make the back part of the plane ice, or make it all ice, then it might fly better
help 2022-09-29 00:31:48 oh
help 2022-09-29 00:31:59 huh thats weird, did you mess with them at all?
creations-chat 2022-09-29 02:04:18 well no what you said was using basic grammar, that fact that you put "i dont like this build," the statement: "why'd you ping me for this dogshit" refers to the subject (Why'd you ping me for this build)

creations-chat 2022-09-29 04:13:05 yeah, maybe make the window shield more swept back if possible? ( more rounded)

help 2022-09-29 18:09:34 is there a way i could put it on a spinner to make it spiral?
help 2022-09-29 18:09:56 like a vortex kinda?
help 2022-09-29 18:13:31 ok
help 2022-09-29 22:13:45 Yeah it’s not motorlocked so it’s quite obvious.
help 2022-09-29 23:52:35 Looks good!
creations-chat 2022-09-30 03:36:28 why does the bf109 have so many dislikes, its better than most that ive seen
help 2022-09-30 03:44:25 is that an elevator?
help 2022-09-30 03:44:34 hmmm
help 2022-09-30 03:44:39 piston operated?
help 2022-09-30 03:45:40 the motor lock might be breaking the rope?
help 2022-09-30 03:45:51 idk, ive never motor locked so im probably wrong
help 2022-09-30 03:46:47 suspension can help ease the load and make it easier to lift stuff, try a conveyer elevator maybe?
help 2022-09-30 03:47:09 i can send u a tutorial link if you need it.
help 2022-09-30 04:08:04 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7_2Je2Qif4
help 2022-09-30 04:08:14 there might be a better version
help 2022-09-30 04:10:10 ok i think i saw the tutorial you were using, it looks like it does bug out sometimes, so your elevator may actually work, but just be bugging out
help 2022-09-30 04:11:01 the problem with the conveyer elevator is that it can be harder to lift stuff (from my experience)
help 2022-09-30 04:11:16 also, your elevator platform out of ice if you can
help 2022-09-30 04:11:25 that will make it a little easier to lift things
help 2022-09-30 04:11:28 gl on it
help 2022-09-30 04:18:10 oh ok, just play around with it and you will probably be able to make it work
help 2022-09-30 17:17:52 ive used it on my carrier before, although i do have an anchor block for it, i dont have any issues with it when unfolding (most of the time).

creations-chat 2023-02-14 06:57:21 Maybe some side rails and runway markings? (I don’t know how to motorlock so I am limited in what detail I can add).
creations-chat 2023-02-15 00:58:04 <@909515374184251433> excellent build, but make the exterior lighting more consistent? it looks like some areas are just "circles" of light.

plane-crazy 2023-02-16 18:01:25 yeah
creations-chat 2023-02-16 20:15:39 oh... uhhh its part of the yaw mechanic on the flying carrier (which the cannon is mounted on)
creations-chat 2023-02-17 00:08:18 Yeah that would be cool, issue with that is I don’t think I could motorlock a rotating point in the center since it would be off grid.
creations-chat 2023-02-17 00:53:20 Since I’m now catching on to motor locking, I am almost done with my avengers helicarrier and was trying to decide whether I should attempt to angle lock the top deck. Suggestions?
help 2023-02-17 20:48:16 Sounds like your plane might be nose heavy.
help 2023-02-17 20:48:49 Play around with the center of gravity to see if it fixes itself.
help 2023-02-17 20:48:56 Could you send a pic of it?
help 2023-02-17 23:24:29 Hmm idk actually, just play around with the weight, that usually helps fix it.

help 2023-03-09 18:31:30 oh, you mean the running gear?
help 2023-03-09 18:32:31 yeah that could work for him, although it depends on how large the cylinders are since they need enough space to be placed.
help 2023-03-09 18:34:01 yes that is running gear
help 2023-03-09 18:34:56 yeah, next thing he would have to worry about is the gearing ceasing up
help 2023-03-09 18:35:23 because when you just have a beam like that it can sometimes cease up if not enough momentum is carried in it.
help 2023-03-09 18:36:10 lol same
help 2023-03-09 18:37:22 if you are trying to create some type of conveyer (roll spinner) i would suggest just using two motors with the same settings as that would be much easier than adding running gear (which could also cause problems).

creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:04:24 Well I think something to realize is that intersex is a defect, it is not intended, therefor there are only 2 sexes.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:06:57 jesus, an i9? that thing loves to turn into nuclear reactor bruh
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:09:31 do you get this on other devices using the same wifi?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:14:59 you seem to talk like you know about biology but fail to understand that something that is not intended by the biological reproduction system is considered "abnormal," and is a mutation, it is classified separately. Also, if you want to discuss more move to <#495286269459300364>
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:21:10 Also to help you on your ping issue, this is something that may be able to be fixed or it is unavoidable. Firstly, what speed is your wifi? Do you use ethernet? Secondly, if it is not your wifi, being in a server closer to you (for example if you live in cali, then try to find a cali server) The ping is affected by server strain, if you have a high frame rate it is obviously not your computer that is the issue, it is the connection between your computer and the server. The larger a build is (the more parts that need to be rendered) the more strain there will be on a server resulting in high ping. This works the same way when moving, the server has to compute the movement of a massive structure and this is not necessarily easy for it to do, resulting in large builds to cause high ping and move slowly.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:24:01 ah yes that's the tricky part, you can always use a VPN, but those you mostly have to pay for so other than that, there may be some third party app that will tell you the server location when you join a server. Other than that, there isn't anyway to tell. Although you can sort of tell depending on your ping without any loaded parts. (for example if you have 300 ping and nothing is even loaded, you are very far away from servers, if you have 10 ping when nothing is loaded, you are much much closer to the servers). Also, do you know what ping represents?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:27:35 "I identify as a multi-gendered fungus." dude did an awesome job below explaining
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:37:06 please stop thinking of it as something in the middle, it is neither of the two sexes, intersex is a term to describe an anomaly. you can not be both sexes, based off terms we have been using for years, it is impossible. You can be "intersex" but that is not man and woman, it is totally different.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:39:56 dude I know, I am talking about sexes, not gender. Gender nowadays is completely manipulative you can legit do whatever you want with it, which in my opinion is a little bit annoying.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:42:16 is it not an anomaly though? It is not considered as a birth defect or disability because it doesn't cause any bad things.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:44:44 this doesnt support your point, it is natural, but varies from the norm therefor it can be called an anomaly. For example, if for generations your family has had black hair and all of a sudden someone pops up with brown hair, that is an anomaly.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:46:48 having an anomaly is not bad, all it says is that you have something different from other people, in our society that would actually be viewed as something quite interesting by most people since it is not usual to see.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:50:20 bro i just said that something that deviates from the norm is an anomaly 💀. Also, I would like to correct myself and say that it defects from the norm. Another thing, just because a million people (example) are intersex, that doesnt mean it is a lot, if you compare that to the 7.8 billion people on earth that is a fraction.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:52:31 from what I remember, no, they have a chance of showing up and they are a recessive trait (sorry I havent done biology in a while). (basically eventually no one on earth will have blue eyes)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:54:47 not evolution, blue eyes were not an evolution because they dont help humans at all, an evolution helps humans.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 19:00:22 I included the screenshot for fox, not for you sorry for the confusion. <@573970670854340628> can we take this to the <#495286269459300364> <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-04-16 19:05:34 ~~woohooo I didn't get muted!11!1!~~
creations-chat 2023-04-21 15:59:52 Did the bot go on vacation or something? Probably got sick of bad builds <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-04-22 15:30:43 The warns are rolling out lol
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:16:35 I feel bad for the mega bus, it is such an awful build for it’s time, if you built this 5 or 6 years back, it would shock the entire community lol.
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:48:37 I estimated that around every 3 weeks someone joins and posts all their shit builds and then there is a 20% chance of them being bullied out of the server
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:54:03 the more unique and rare it is to see on PCC the more upvotes it will get.
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:56:48 I mean, this was not high effort and was actually my first motorlock build and it did pretty good https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1075872686762369075 (again like i said, the more unique the better)
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:59:51 just post it, you are always going to have people who dont like it
creations-chat 2023-05-03 23:01:53 I don't like building planes specifically because of the standards for them, large scale builds are my choice.
creations-chat 2023-05-03 23:13:14 by far the best option for new builders is to NOT post anything in creations, it will save you a lot of time having to deal with "insults"

help 2023-07-04 23:35:23 Here is my advice. Build tutorial builds (but please don’t post them here). This will help you learn how to build functional  planes and other things.
help 2023-07-04 23:36:38 What is it doing.
help 2023-07-04 23:39:30 Did you flip the control surfaces?
help 2023-07-04 23:40:01 I’ve had issues before where the control surface would bug out if I flipped the control surfaces.
help 2023-07-04 23:43:22 I blocked Dino
