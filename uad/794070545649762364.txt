plane-crazy 2023-04-07 23:29:26 The fact that we didn‚Äôt get a winter update means rick is working hard

general 2023-04-08 02:27:39 ig
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:34:31 what does this look like to you guys
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:34:53 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:38:24 yeah but which kind
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:38:40 i tried to make it look sort of like a spitfire
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:39:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:39:37 no super rockets hidden inside
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 02:40:06 i made the seat way too far in the front

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:51:21 Why
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:53:12 I have a build that requires pvp mode to function
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:53:32 It uses explosives with 0 blast radius as destructible blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:54:48 Make it so you can detonate explosives in non pvp but they do 0 damage
general 2023-04-08 06:55:11 Mules are horse+donkey
general 2023-04-08 06:57:55 Ik

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:11:18 does this look like an Me 262 to anyone
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:11:47 i'll take that as a no
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:12:08 when i started building it, i intended it to be one
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:13:53 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:14:01 ok i found the blueprints
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:14:39 i still have no idea how the thing stands on 3 landing gears
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:15:02 no i mean
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:15:18 look at the landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:27:07 is this better now
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:28:19 or do the engines have to be lower as well
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:29:20 goes from 1080 to 180
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:30:46 ^
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:31:32 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:32:23 i have both a picture of one and the blueprints
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:32:53 what about it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:33:49 i don't have a lot of experience with building planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:35:02 I AM WORKING ON IT
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:39:02 ok is that better
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:42:43 the plane or the engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:42:56 so make it shorter?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:43:15 um
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:43:16 how
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:43:42 i knew the back was bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:44:03 so how should i fix the nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:47:17 remember this thing also has to actually fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:47:43 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:47:54 currently this thing pitches up really hard at high speed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:48:53 wouldn't making the back heavier cause it to pitch up more
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:49:12 oh right
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:49:22 let me fix the nose first
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:51:32 how do i make the sides go into the nose more smoothly
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:51:40 1x2 half wedges?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:51:55 that's what i used before
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:52:02 then someone told me it looked off
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:53:36 oh wait those are wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:53:40 i thought they were blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:56:14 better question: why were you using night mode
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:56:53 bad build
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:21 something about it looks off
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:59:08 the NAVY
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:59:26 second largest air force after
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:59:30 the US airforce
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:00:38 with the √±
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:01:24 done
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:02:04 just choked on cucumber
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:02:39 i was eating a cucumber
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:02:52 i had
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:02:58 a cucumber in my mouth
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:03:40 ok so this is the nose so far, now do i remove the pyramid
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:06:46 i'm renaming my messerschmitt to messershitt
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:08:22 yes he was
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:08:51 ok i need balassats on the front
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:10:11 if you fix this messerchitt maybe
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:11:08 oh wait
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:11:13 i figured out the pitching up issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:11:21 it's because you guys told me to put the engines low
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:12:07 if i put them level with the wings it won't flip out
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:14:40 yeah if i have the engines level with the wings it's fine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:23:12 how do i deal with the tail
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:23:17 long wedge?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:24:00 when motorlocked
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:24:32 really...

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:29:43 
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:29:45 the motorlock is a mess
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:24 how do i get this to pitch up faster
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:43 jets are heavy?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:48 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:58 took them off
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:39:10 oh wow
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:39:12 that was the issu
