creations-chat 2019-06-12 06:21:05 so i guess enough parachutes just cause it to float :?
bug-reports 2019-06-12 06:40:23 
bug-reports 2019-06-12 06:40:35 parachutes fly if you put more than 30 on a creation
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:52:01 i want to make a kaiju, but how would i :?
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:54:18 oh no im building it right now
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:54:26 im thinking on how to do these legs
creations-chat 2019-06-13 00:24:13 this isnt working
creations-chat 2019-06-13 00:26:18 or an aquatic kaiju is even better and easier to build
creations-chat 2019-06-13 01:05:11 tail? easy i make tails that move by them selves on all my animals
creations-chat 2019-06-13 01:05:20 going under water might be trouble though
creations-chat 2019-06-13 02:03:51 This "Kaiju" brings me down to about 10 fps but it has the most blocks of any of my creations
creations-chat 2019-06-14 21:07:59 
creations-chat 2019-06-14 21:07:59 
creations-chat 2019-06-14 21:08:03 i made my kaiju
creations-chat 2019-06-14 22:55:54 it actually walks and stuff
creations-chat 2019-06-15 02:53:55 well my kaiju can walk more than 8 feet without falling i just need to understand this thing has no thruster stabilizers like my other walkers, i keep spamming U expecting it to balance me
creations-chat 2019-06-15 03:23:38 goal: hydra
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:01 
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:16 its so easy to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:46 you kinda just mix pressing Q, E, R, W, and there you fly!
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 06:05:58 ever wonder why people dislike all your creations?
creations-chat 2019-06-15 07:48:24 both my kaijus have 433 blocks
creations-chat 2019-06-15 07:48:38 my next one with hopfully have over 1000
creations-chat 2019-06-16 00:25:18 its the most amazing thing ive ever seen
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 04:15:01 hello there
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 04:15:01 https://gyazo.com/e3814b02a288f295314ccacdec28afbf
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 18:11:05 thats plane crazy right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 18:11:26 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 18:11:36 i switched servers thinking i switched channels
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 18:11:40 minor stupidity
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 18:11:54 sorry to bother your brain cells
general 2020-03-29 06:10:39 The problem with my 4 segment folding ship is it requires an eight prong magnet engine to even move at 60 speed and requires 3 magnet engines on each side to turn
creations-chat 2020-03-29 06:26:09 Not my best but its a long boy
creations-chat 2020-03-29 06:26:16 about 3-ish plots long
creations-chat 2020-03-29 06:27:39 Also hands
creations-chat 2020-03-29 06:27:56 They are fully apposable and the fingers all move independently
general 2020-07-06 08:43:54 Hmm, how does one make a suggestion?
general 2020-07-06 08:44:50 Little screens the feed from cameras can be projected on to, I doubt my idea is original but for what I'm building it'd be cool.
general 2020-07-06 08:45:22 You configure them to have the same screen as a camera, then you can turn them off and on
general 2020-07-06 08:46:52 Oh
general 2020-07-06 08:47:42 Guess I should complete one of the challenges, if that counts as a rank
general 2020-07-06 08:47:52 Or is it more of an active thing?
general 2020-07-06 08:52:52 I can do a few of these
general 2020-07-06 08:57:28 I have a 2000 block ship, I can remove the anchor which I just use so it folds with less lag..
general 2020-07-06 09:02:53 Hey for the shipwright, does it have to be new or can it be old?
general 2020-07-06 09:03:11 Because I have a 2000 block ship I can use
general 2020-07-06 09:03:29 And it only flips if something hits it 

*cough* my friend flying a plane into the sails
general 2020-07-06 09:04:53 Oh this thing doesn't use magnet engines to move
general 2020-07-06 09:04:56 No wonder its so slow
general 2020-07-06 09:06:12 It never mentioned anything against anchors
general 2020-07-06 09:11:08 Hmm
general 2020-07-06 09:11:31 Should I just use the record function on roblox to record my evidence?
general 2020-07-06 09:12:24 Well I don't have screen capture software
general 2020-07-06 09:12:36 Oh
general 2020-07-06 09:14:31 Well, so I can get the rank I want. What software should I use?
general 2020-07-06 09:17:07 I'm just going to use the roblox recording thing if no one answers me
general 2020-07-06 09:18:21 7 seconds is going to prove a creation for shipwright 4?
general 2020-07-06 09:24:34 It's 4:24 AM for me so
general 2020-07-06 09:25:20 And I finally got proof of it being 2000 blocks, now its just the challenge of getting proof of it turning and moving
general 2020-07-06 09:25:44 Which isn't hard since its entire inside is stuffed with super rocket engines
general 2020-07-06 09:27:31 ~~__***Ha, I'm special.***__~~
general 2020-07-06 09:29:22 a 7 second clip of it turning will do nothing since it takes closer to 20 seconds for it to do a full 360
general 2020-07-06 09:29:41 All I can prove is it turning for 7 seconds and moving forward for 7 seconds
general 2020-07-06 09:37:42 I DID IT
general 2020-07-06 09:37:49 I GOT IT MOVING ABOVE 50
general 2020-07-06 09:37:50 https://gyazo.com/cc9c5fa878fbd08d86dbf20a5fa91a4a
general 2020-07-06 09:39:52 Now its the challenge of getting it to turn on camera
general 2020-07-06 09:41:27 The reason it's such a challenge to get this thing to turn on camera..
general 2020-07-06 09:41:28 https://gyazo.com/3bc6c10522d31e7e2358bcc4d6ba67ed
general 2020-07-06 09:41:36 Is because *this is it turning*
general 2020-07-06 09:42:07 Yeah, having 6 gyazo tabs open, roblox, and discord puts a bit of strain on a laptop
general 2020-07-06 09:42:43 Are magnet engines against the rules? I think this thing needs them to turn, it will not turn any faster than that
general 2020-07-06 09:43:09 It's turning speed is literally one sps
general 2020-07-06 09:46:00 I wonder if I should just wait until tomorrow to request my rank or ask tonight and get it over with
general 2020-07-06 09:46:11 I'll have to save the videos somewhere if I do it tomorrow though.
general 2020-07-06 09:47:48 Yeah but I need it to suggest stuff
general 2020-07-06 09:47:58 And I'll forget my suggestion knowing me.
general 2020-07-06 23:59:38 Me over here with a 300 dollar prebuilt laptop from walmart
general 2020-07-07 00:05:29 I may only have 50 hours on plane crazy but I've successfully broken the game with every form of transportation (Air, underwater, above water, ground)
general 2020-07-08 06:07:31 Wait how are you getting that beam effect?
general 2020-07-10 07:26:45 So I decided to make all the terraria bosses in Plane Crazy
general 2020-07-11 06:27:36 Where the fuck did general go
general 2020-07-11 06:27:54 Oh yeah
general 2020-07-24 03:40:10 Where would I put an image too beautiful for your average human to comprehend?
general 2020-07-24 03:45:48 Fine, right here then.
general 2020-07-24 03:45:50 
general 2020-08-02 00:57:37 I never did submit my proof for the shipwright did I?
general 2020-08-02 00:57:44 hm
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:03:42 SHIPWRIGHT [IV]
https://gyazo.com/b7500ed3c38586faa64ca9f5758fe642 Block count 
https://gyazo.com/3bc6c10522d31e7e2358bcc4d6ba67ed Turns at a zooming 1 sps
https://gyazo.com/cc9c5fa878fbd08d86dbf20a5fa91a4a Actual speed

Helium count: 3 blocks, all in the ladder so it doesn't get in the way of the ship. 
Is that all?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:03:57 I was asking if that's right
general 2020-08-02 04:40:12 e
general 2020-08-02 04:40:16 HEEY
general 2020-08-02 04:40:18 I GOT IT
general 2020-08-06 20:34:42 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/665336469489188904/741030549162033222/unknown.png
general 2020-08-06 20:34:44 mmm
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:42:41 I'm not going to suggest anything but if someone wants to pass my message..

Add a more redwood like area, somewhere to test the mobility of your planes
general 2020-10-25 18:11:16 
general 2020-10-25 18:11:18 This is illegal
general 2020-10-25 18:13:05 Damage nebulas
general 2021-07-29 06:26:39 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/821222000906862592/870189578663911454/RobloxScreenShot20210729_022231643.png 

Apologies for the screenshot, normal windows + shift+ s ones aren't working
general 2021-07-29 06:27:15 ignore the worm, just the chat. Some person and my friend were arguing
general 2021-07-29 06:28:57 anyway, now like the 5 people who saw know who that person is. I'm happy, good bye.
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:22 
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:28 Well the mech with no powered motors has arms
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:34 but the problem is because of that
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:39 it has trouble balancing while standing
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:47 so I currently have a single beam of helium
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:04:58 and getting rid of that is surprisingly difficult
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:18:12 
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 11:18:14 and it stands
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:26:00 I noticed the glitching. But to be fair having a mech that uses something similar to hydraulics to move the mech is a bit more interesting
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:30:11 That's not exactly what I meant by piston powered. It's hard to see in the  screenshot but the pistons are in L shapes and are meant to replace the motors without using 17 million weird building techniques and what I consider glitches
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:32:25 <:)
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:37:21 I am like 7 years behind when it comes to building advanced stuff like that. I sorta just do my thing so when I see people with whatever is even going on in that gif I just start wondering what happened to this game
