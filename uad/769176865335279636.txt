general 2022-11-09 06:18:50 are any of you on the hall of fame?
general 2022-11-09 06:19:05 thats debatable
general 2022-11-09 06:20:52 yeah that could kill london
general 2022-11-09 06:21:40 if you had like a fleet of them
bot-central 2022-11-09 06:22:04 !rank
general 2022-11-09 06:22:25 wait
general 2022-11-09 06:22:27 its so big
general 2022-11-09 06:22:31 i thought it was much smaller

general 2022-11-09 06:23:20 depending on the warhead
general 2022-11-09 06:23:25 it might be able to kill london

bot-central 2022-11-09 06:24:49 !rank
general 2022-11-09 06:25:03 yk i think a ton of bombs
general 2022-11-09 06:25:06 could kill london
general 2022-11-09 06:25:09 anything these days
general 2022-11-09 06:25:13 could kill london
general 2022-11-09 06:25:22 even if you sent a plane into the river
general 2022-11-09 06:25:25 it would kill someone
general 2022-11-09 06:25:37 when do you think the update will be
general 2022-11-09 06:25:47 cause the images the creator posts
general 2022-11-09 06:25:50 look pretty cool
general 2022-11-09 06:25:55 hopefully they make the map bigger
general 2022-11-09 06:26:03 since it is quite small at the moment
bot-central 2022-11-09 06:26:08 !rank
general 2022-11-09 06:30:59 no but like
general 2022-11-09 06:31:09 if you sent it down the river temms
general 2022-11-09 06:31:17 into the near ceter
general 2022-11-09 06:31:20 center
general 2022-11-09 06:31:21 then
general 2022-11-09 06:31:23 it could kill
general 2022-11-09 06:31:28 plus it has a nuclear warhead in it
general 2022-11-09 06:31:33 if you looked at the diagram
general 2022-11-09 06:31:39 i think it will
general 2022-11-09 06:31:48 look at an image of the river temms
general 2022-11-09 06:31:55 and then look at that torpedo
general 2022-11-09 06:32:02 i think itll definatly fit
general 2022-11-09 06:32:38 its 20m deep
general 2022-11-09 06:32:44 thats more than enough space
general 2022-11-09 06:33:29 it might
general 2022-11-09 06:33:35 if it isnt very fast
general 2022-11-09 06:34:09 even if it didnt reach the middle
general 2022-11-09 06:34:12 the warhead is massice
general 2022-11-09 06:34:14 massive
