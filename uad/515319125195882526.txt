plane-crazy 2020-12-16 00:59:52 i finally finished my first >400 block build (860 blocks total) and being kind of a bad builder i thought i'd ask for feedback on how to improve the quality of my future builds and show this off at the same time
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:04:59 it's *supposed* to be this
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:05:09 but it looks like a hot mess
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:27:24 did i hear the 2 words "winter update"
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:28:00 g
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:59:58 apparently something, but i kind of think this entire argument is pointless

plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:02:56 not so cuddly anymore -fish
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:03:16 because motor @ doesnt exist in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:04:20 people don't know that i'm forklift certified <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:08:49 that was interesting but also pointless
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:32:41 i just kinda dont really like how there's random grey plates on the side and that pale avocado green doesnt look the best either imo
creations-chat 2020-12-16 22:35:02 1, that looks nothing like a mag; 2, it really just doesnt look great in general
general 2020-12-23 06:02:34 i am in a constant perpetual cycle of "i will make tank game" "i will do it later" "i should do it now" "oh wait i cant script" "i will do it later"
general 2020-12-23 06:03:06 tried that, didnt help
general 2020-12-23 06:03:22 still cant script
general 2020-12-23 06:03:26 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
general 2020-12-23 06:04:36 theres steel titans (in beta), tankery (kinda iffy thanks to the bugs n shit), the tamnk game (make custom tanks with WT-style knock out the crew gameplay)
general 2020-12-23 06:04:55 we dont talk about tank warfare for obvious reasons
general 2020-12-23 06:05:05 lemme see what else there is
general 2020-12-23 06:06:35 i cant motivate myself to build a good plane (nor can i build a good plane for that matter <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>)
general 2020-12-23 06:07:45 ive been playing since alpha but what the shit is motor lock and why have i never used it
general 2020-12-23 06:07:51 sounds useful
general 2020-12-23 06:09:13 its more a jet that has a stroke in midair when either the rocket engines are super rocket engines or when there is a lot of client lag
general 2020-12-23 06:09:36 its brit*sh
general 2020-12-23 06:09:48 shitfire is brit*sh
