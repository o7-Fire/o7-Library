plane-crazy 2022-10-10 19:58:35 The Draken
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:00:08 The B2 was inspired by the Ho 229
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:00:42 Germany is... let's just say, creative
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:02:36 I made a motorlocked Post WWI style plane, but it's so small there's exposed motor lock

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:12:55 I also made this howitzer style cannon
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:14:47 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:16:55 The rocket and suspension are to simulate the blow back of the cannon
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:17:20 thats a speaker
creations-chat 2022-10-10 20:27:35 Heres a plane I made
creations-chat 2022-10-10 20:31:42 heres the plane in top view
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:44:27 Why not use motor 2s instead of using cameras to make perfect angles?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:47:23 Woah
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:00:55 Imagine it gets upvoted
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:33:24 Hello
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:39:00 Here's a plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:40:40 No idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:40:43 Anyway
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:41:19 It also has asymmetrical wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:47:50 Here's the top view
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:48:26 Got bored and wanted to make asymmetrical plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:48:56 No, it actually flies straight
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:49:07 I motorlocked more wings to the shorter wing
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:49:24 Got bored
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 15:50:11 Guess just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:19:21 I may or may not have gotten bored again
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:20:44 No I made this to cure my boredom
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:21:02 
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:21:33 also yes it does work, just kind of
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:27:39 I made these out of boredom, any thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:29:55 Tbh, they aren't really made to look pretty
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:32:23 by the way, the one wing still flies, there is also a motor attaching the wing to the main hull to make it go up and down without turning to the left
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:34:33 Fuuuu-
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:27:43 What if I make another abnormal plane
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:29:50 I already have an idea of what it should be <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 15:33:09 What if I make a plane that takes off like a rocket, but still flies like a plane
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:33:51 I'm gonna make a plane that can launch like a rocket yet still fly like a plane
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:35:58 Yes, but it's gonna launch vertically and land vertically, like those space x boosters
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 15:36:37 Yes that but different design
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:38:30 Yeah, half block and elite know what I'm talking about
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:41:07 I'm gonna make it look like a rocket, but then 2 wings would fold out, basically an F-14 wing mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 15:46:54 Wait show me an image of what that is
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 15:48:22 Huh, I'll think about it
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:47:33 Use helium if it can't float
creations-chat 2022-10-12 19:57:22 I should try to make that..
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:06 Then ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:59 Ok
creations-chat 2022-10-12 20:12:41 Huh
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:15:03 Metal blocks are heavier
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:15:22 Ice blocks are slippery I think?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:21:55 Does slate have a function besides visual?
creations-chat 2022-10-13 20:16:09 Why not use sparklers?
creations-chat 2022-10-13 20:19:03 I mean, it can be used for a barrel
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:25:52 Should I make a World War I/II style artillery?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:27:42 I have some pictures of artillery but I don't know what to pick
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:31:22 Here are the pictures
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:31:26 
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:31:33 
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:31:39 
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:32:24 So I should combine them
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:32:57 Alr then
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:33:04 I'll see what I can do
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:39:23 Alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 01:39:50 I'm trying to make a WWI/II artillery
the-dump 2022-10-17 15:13:49 
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:37:17 If I make an artillery what rank could I get?
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:37:54 No as in for getting ranks
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:38:04 Not posting it in creations
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:39:35 Wait do we send the link of the creation to the rank request?
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:40:49 Then why did he say this
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 15:41:40 Ok, anyway
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 17:45:05 Why need an ejection seat when you can just, jump off and use your own parachute
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:18:51 How did you attach the sparklers together?

Oh ok
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:21:00 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 19:23:46 Then why do we have school <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:24:26 Should I make this even though I have no idea how to make the wheels
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:26:56 Alright time to sound like an idiot.

creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:29:01 Ohhh, so basically make it tiny
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:31:05 Yes I do know what motor lock is
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:33:49 Alright, I also know *some* cam lock so it should help I hope
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 19:50:00 Does anyone know what this is called?
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 19:51:03 I'm talking about the name of the artillery, I'm trying to find proportions of it
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 19:54:12 That does not help
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 19:54:22 I'm trying to find the exact name
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 20:02:01 Ok found the name of the mortar
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 20:05:45 I just found out the mortar can move its cannon 360 degrees
creations-chat 2022-10-17 23:53:48 Think this can be a good idea for a build? I'm also gonna make the engine that pulls this
creations-chat 2022-10-17 23:59:42 Change of plans I'm making this
creations-chat 2022-10-18 01:08:29 any improvements i can make?
creations-chat 2022-10-18 01:10:34 oh i havent thought of using those, thanks

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 15:33:08 Can you make one for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 15:33:48 Alr
creations-chat 2022-10-18 15:47:23 What if I make another version of the logo?
creations-chat 2022-10-18 19:21:27 Alr sweet

creations-chat 2022-10-19 03:38:35 What improvements do I need to do, I have no idea how to solve the exposed motor lock though
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 11:08:27 Any improvements i can make? i have no idea how to fix the exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 11:08:58 i have no idea how though
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 11:12:12 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 17:42:51 Here's a wip of my cannon, there's half blocks so it hides the exposed motor lock because I don't know any other way of hiding it
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 17:43:37 I can steer with them
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 17:43:51 And I push the cannon to move it foward
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 17:47:18 It's pretty easy, make one wheel use A and D controls and the other D and A
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:12:40 Thoughts on this?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:13:12 Ok then
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:13:25 What colors should I use
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:14:07 I don't blame you one of my friends thought it was a steamboat
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:14:15 Alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:15:27 Alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:17:47 Should I also add some variations of different textures?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:33:27 is this better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:33:57 alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:35:59 is this good?

plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:43:34 I had all of the blocks that are able to have different textures be metal, then i added slate to add some detail
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:44:20 so, is there anything else i should change?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 11:45:28 alr, thanks

plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:33:31 Should I make a Railway Cannon, an AA Turret, or Smoke Artillery?
