creations-chat 2022-09-16 01:42:08 dont even try bro ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:10:48 guys...
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:11:02 i think i just created a perpetual motion device
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:11:04 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:11:20 im scared
general 2022-09-17 04:13:45 hey uh has perpetual motion in plane crazy been achieved?
general 2022-09-17 04:14:09 because i have a very interesting discovery if not
general 2022-09-17 04:14:18 yeah
general 2022-09-17 04:14:29 thought so :/
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:16:57 when roblox physics <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:28:10 absolutely amazing
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:28:18 0 alternatives that could be considered better
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:31:04 100 million trillion quadrillion quintillion mega percent
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:31:50 Oh damn
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:33:01 oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:35:29 undocumented
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:40:57 it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:41:01 yellow tracer does jack
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:41:16 yeah, that is why guns arent typically used on aircraft/anything that moves
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:41:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:41:27 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:42:35 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:45:05 im thinking about a weapon system that grabs onto an object and locks a block into place inside your enemy
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:45:33 so like cutters shred into them to begin with, then something extends/rotates to lock it
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:45:42 prolly yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:45:55 not forced
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:46:06 but it is getting shoved into my face aggressively
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:46:38 ye
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:47:23 makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:52:52 I mean, I was thinking of a reusable system wherein you destroy your target with default rockets and unlock it, the locking mechanism is basically just to make it so you dont have to aim
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:53:15 ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:54:17 Yeah i guess that would make more sense
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:55:38 Well, megabytes used to be stored in entire rooms, so a more reliable method will probably be concocted by these code-manipulating megaminds of PCC
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:56:19 i did
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:56:42 yeah, but better ones will probably come up at some point
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:57:00 eh, im all for evolution of ideas
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:57:19 pvp weapons > rocket
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:57:22 wait that's 1x2
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:57:26 damn
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:57:48 idk
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:58:23 theyll find a way
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:58:56 i mean it'd need external propulsion, probably by either a plane's velocity or magnets
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:35 is that 1x1?
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:37 looks like uh
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:39 1x
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:44 10
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:53 ohhh wait
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 04:59:57 1x1x1 isnt 1x1
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:00:06 yeah i just now got that
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:00:07 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:00:26 in that case it's probably pretty easy
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:00:34 to an extent of course
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:01:06 lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:01:58 how would 2x2 decoupling work?
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:02:13 without adding too much weight
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:02:16 and make it look good
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:02:27 ig it doesnt have to look good but yknow
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:02:30 true
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:04:13 damn you're fast
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:05:19 well, compact things come with compromises
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 05:06:04 oh nice
