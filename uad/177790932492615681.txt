plane-crazy 2019-05-20 17:09:25 My friend keeps getting kicked after the new update
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 17:09:29 idk why
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:06:14 E
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:45:49 when you complement someones build and they look at you and blacklist you without saying a word
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:46:23 those types of people are just ungrateful peace's of crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:47:27 Not if the person is legit giving you a complement about your building
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:47:54 it's like someone holding the door open for you and then you slamming the door in their face when you have walked through
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:54:03 "EQUIPO"
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:02:26 How do you suggest stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:02:50 the Suggestion room is locked and you cant do it anywhere else how is the community supposed to suggest things lmao
bot-central 2019-06-07 12:04:01 &suggest Make it people can't blacklist everyone in the game on PVP and sit in their base with multiple guns and rockets and shoot everyone that spawns in their build.
bot-central 2019-06-07 12:04:11 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:15 Doesn't work.
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:26 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:37 Thats stupid.
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:58 Then if they do you just ban them?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:05:18 I didnt say you was
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:05:28 I was just saying how easy it is to deal with and stop
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:08:32 nvm you don't get it.
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:10:52 I have Mee6 muted by default he's the big annoying
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:11:25 Sur gonna have to ask you to cease the historical flag as people get the big offended by history
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:17 well having the flag isnt bad as its a historical thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:21 but if they're saying the slurs
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:24 which come with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:25 then
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:28 thats the big bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:51 E
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:13:40 tbh building the flag isnt bad its a historical item in history but if your legit saying "gas the" then you deserve to be shot and banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:14:44 because screw history! and yes I know that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:16:44 unless you make a script which detects the placement of blocks and if it matches a banned set amount of blocks then yeet
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:35 well if you give the roblox community the ability to build anything they will abuse it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:35:52 Where do you report people in this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:15 where do you report people
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:42 where do you report people?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:48 in the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:50 or here
help 2019-06-11 15:37:13 http://prntscr.com/o0ilys
help 2019-06-11 15:37:23 Username is in the screenshot.
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:09:42 you know what would be good for the game Gyros
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:10:18 so you can set up a auto correction system for a helicopter which automatically rights and keeps itself stable lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:10:29 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:11:43 yes but the motors are very limiting since they break if you move too far and they disaline
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:47 plus this happens
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:17 if I dont use motor lock the power of the massive fans make it clap itself to death
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:33 
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:34 i.e these fans
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:14:31 I've some how made both of the fans so that the left is on the right and the right is on the left
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:14:37 was a good spiral to the floor
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:15:02 When making stuff like that its hard to fit into a small build
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:15:16 I mean look at the Rotor Assembly someone made it was massive xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:19:54 normal motors can be easily messed up and disalined hence people use Locked
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:21:24 death by being clapped by your own creation <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:24:01 That shade of purple messes with my eyes I'm like "I'M GOING BLIND"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:25:19 constructive feed back and conversations about how to make the game better is good better then your community being like "LUL MAKE THING WORK"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:26:06 how to fix roblox physics ``while true do end``
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:26:49 when your memory is that bad even you dont trust it

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:37 E
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:29:22 its worse and worse the more you show us lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:30:05 now they just use a crap tone of parachutes and explosive blocks

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:13:17 and so on
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:13 [insert that but twice the amount on one helicopter]
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:47 they'll never take you down
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:57 they wont know what rotor to hit
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:15:31 when you go past 100 rotors your helicopters hull is now counted as a blade

bug-reports 2019-07-27 19:51:51 The beam is physically inside another block making it physically impossible to place it when you can clearly be able to place it down
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:28 you know when you make a massive build everything works
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:40 and the damn save data thing makes it so you cant save
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:43 you dont notice
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:46 you load it again
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:50 and all that work is gone
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:44:11 because I didnt know that when you hit the damn limit it deletes all the changes

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:58:35 https://gyazo.com/d0de8cbbc74900de2bbb254fe14c9ef1
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:58:39 git flexed on
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:58:56 I just fixed a broken Registry but shh we wont speak about that
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:59:17 I mean I didnt invite you to
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:59:21 so that would be illegal
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:59:24 e dab
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:00:56 I have 2 terabyte so I'm g000d
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:01:32 the Registry is just basic stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:01:47 I just had to fix two Registry missing dlls
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:02:13 thats why you get a good anti-virus which does all of that
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:02:28 or just dont download from scetchy sites in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:11 I use Avast
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:22 better the Mcaffee
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:27 then*
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:47 Avast is one of the good anti-virus
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:56 A
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:04:20 Plus I use their browser thing which shows trusted sites which arent gonna download crap
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:04:49 Chrome is big crap
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:04:51 it eats
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:04:53 RAM
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:04:59 like nobodies business
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:05:28 I disable chrome when playing games other than Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:03 Avast or one of the other big companies which provide anti-vrisus
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:08 virus*
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:28 no u
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:46 Its legit caught a crap tone of stuff just from entering a site
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:01 plus its fast at blocking stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:14 I use adblock
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:23 but adblock doesnt stop background downloads
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:09:05 I have an Adblocker an Anti-virus and a VPN along with a cleaner program which are all trusted and are good to protect me from low end attacks and medium attacks they're the only levels of attacks you'd get from basic browsing but if you do illegal stuff then you're gonna get a Trojan or something else powerful infecting your PC
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:10:15 Boy you'd know if you had a Trojan on your PC it'll be bricked
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:10:58 soon as  Trojan gets into your Master Boot Record you're legit screwed lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:12:09 Tbh you barely run into any viruses which can really harm you if you have good protection only deadly viruses or worms are on illegal sites if you avoid those your never gonna see a Trojan or a worm in your entire time browsing on the internet.
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:14 only way you'd get a virus which bricks your PC is if your actually looking to get one or doing something with a high risk of getting one so if your stupid then good luck lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:42 thats what Avast dones too
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:59 I also have my Adblocker which straight up aborts the connection
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:07 <@456226577798135808> no u
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:34 I know everyone has one A
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:35 E
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:15:03 You mean System32
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:15:38 If you delete your System32 folder you'd not have a PC working if you did that
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:16:06 <@456226577798135808> go delete System32 see how long it takes the whole system to go into recovery mode.
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:16:54 System32 Folder is legit where all the important stuff is if you delete it your PC will straight up die lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:17:34 Just use Task Manager to kill Programs lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:17:40 its a built in program
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:18 it'll run so fast it'll go into recovery mode which is a secret gaming mode
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:42 <@218240161719386112> the hell was you doing to get 1k virus or errors
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:50 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:19:05 You know this is a public server right
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:19:26 its public everyones talking about the same topic
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:20:01 <@456226577798135808> No I was saying dont do it but if you wanna go do it I dont recommend it
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:20:25 just listing the crap which will break if you did delete it
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:21:08 <@456226577798135808> you must be mistaken I wasnt doing the meme "Delete system32" I was telling the guy not to do it
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:21:22 see you was over thinking and assuming crap
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:21:35 what

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:23:32 do you just not clean your PC or scan it at all lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:24:33 He still thinks I was making the "Delete System32" meme when I was legit warning the people that could fall for the meme to not delete it as it'll break things lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:25:30 <@299289130964090881> tbh if your downloading from a trusted source and you know its trusted then click "More Info" on the Windows Defender popup and a button called "Install Anyway" will appear
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:25:40 Long as you download from a trusted site you're fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:26:06 then you should be okay then
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:26:39 <@456226577798135808> well we wasnt trying to make you angry you got angry at people talking about the topic
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:26:56 wait

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:00:21 roblox must be giving premium out randomly for testing
bug-reports 2019-08-17 16:21:49 think this is a really important problem but I can spawn inside other peoples builds when I spawn in and their build just doesnt remove so my build and theirs are stuck together
bug-reports 2019-08-17 16:22:54 since normally when a person leaves their build deletes and then allows another person to join just it doesnt remove their build and people spawn and their build spawns inside the other
bug-reports 2019-08-17 17:02:38 Also missiles dont work they just disappear and then reload
bug-reports 2019-08-17 17:03:03 no error message is put out either

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:00:47 I just found out you can put blocks around the wheels and provide extra armour
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:00:54 wheels work and turn
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:01:11 by turn I mean the steerable wheels can still turn
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:01:47 
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:02:16 someone that hates dealing with the wheels detaching themselves from the motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:02:31 causing the whole build to spaz out
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:03:36 Motors are glitchy so I use the default wheels deal with it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:06:19 I mean in the game
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:06:27 what else would you be thinking about
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:25:34 because on discord your required to ban anyone under the age of 13
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:25:57 Still a requirement
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:26:12 when is internet never laggy
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:26:19 ISPs are bad at their jobs lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:27:26 well its the law so dab
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:28:32 if the owner isnt banning <13 then discord just straight up deletes the whole server lul
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:29:55 yeah discord never tells if if the server was banned or not they just delete all channels and lock the server and soon as the owner leaves it auto deletes
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:30:33 also dyno keeps reacting with the eyes when you say < 13

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:37:44 big oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:38:33 I'm thankful they cant touch or save your build when that happens
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:38:47 or someone could straight up join save your build and then dip
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:39:51 that should be a ban able offense
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:40:18 just in case a glitch like that ever does happen then the mods can just ban them
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:41:41 thats why I now just clear the build after saving it and then leave
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:41:46 so it cant possibly be stuck there

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 09:44:24 its meant to look like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 09:44:27 its all to plan
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 09:46:12 tbh I like the turret design I did lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 09:46:20 and yes you created a black hole lmao
bug-reports 2019-09-10 07:55:29 the problem with the Angle and torque not saving on Motor2 is the values of those two problems are switched so when you load the build the max torque is now in the Max Angle slot and the Max Angle is in the Torque slot thats all thats effected.
bug-reports 2019-09-10 07:56:13 so if you put 180 in max angle and save and load when you next look the Max Torque will now be 180 and max angle default 30
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 08:00:02 What's the difference between Servo and mouse aim lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 08:00:16 Servo just the normal motor set up with key controls?

plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:28:15 like sticking a prop engine to the tip to turn it faster
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:02 Anyone know how to deal with boats bouncing in the water side to side or up and down?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:22 my boat just suddenly started doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:47 This is front heavy but its only just started doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:00 It does it when idle
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:02 and moving
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:57 Its only just started doing it so why has it started when I havent changed any weight appart from the roof when I was redesigning it but that was only the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:58:42 I'll try to see if a Ballast Tank fixes the problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 10:06:35 There I fixed the problem I just needed a ballast tank and then tinker with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 17:35:38 The Pontoons just suddenly stopped working while sailing my boat lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 17:35:43 it just sank
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 17:36:15 well it rolled over and then sank lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 18:21:02 Pontoon.exe has full stopped working.
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:20:38 <@!272852191054790656> could make a boarderlands vehicle out of that suspension system lol
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:21:23 
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:21:34 thats the reference image for it
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:23:04 the front wheels rotate on an angle to turn the vehicle
general 2019-09-26 01:40:50 when someone's the perfect amount of stupid where you just plant facts on them while they try to pick small things out about you they just overload and give up lmao
general 2019-09-26 01:41:09 I call that an epic gamer moment
general 2019-09-26 01:41:40 yes and its very enjoyable
general 2019-09-26 01:41:52 I never think I'm winning lmao
general 2019-09-26 01:42:12 I just do it because someone engaged in attempting to make a fool of me so I just do what ever
general 2019-09-26 01:42:35 lol
general 2019-09-26 01:42:46 I had a Russian call me names I just said rush B
general 2019-09-26 01:43:50 oof that man big st00oid
general 2019-09-26 01:44:23 he saw it just ignored it and picked out something to try to get the upper hand thats what we call being st00pid
general 2019-09-26 01:45:05 I tend to not show any scripts when someone says I can't script because then they'd just copy it or something lmao
general 2019-09-26 01:45:21 plus I never find the need to "prove" myself to some random kid on the internet
general 2019-09-26 01:46:11 I've done it here and there like go onto wiki and copy snippets and use it in code because I can't be arsed word for word copying it lmao
general 2019-09-26 01:46:56 I don't know why there is a stigma about devs reusing or snippeting code into their own code
general 2019-09-26 01:47:04 when you copy whole scripts then its bad
general 2019-09-26 01:47:31 but if you're legit making a massive ass script just wiki copying here and there for functions and shiz it's just what ever dev does
general 2019-09-26 01:48:09 same with irl web devs they reference paste bins which are made from other people and shiz
general 2019-09-26 01:49:19 either way never prove yourself to someone thats the moral of the story kids homework and don't do sleep 👍
general 2019-09-26 01:50:39 thats why you dont ground invade russia 👍
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:37:52 Mk apparently teleporting to PVP crashes my Wi-Fi
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:38:00 either roblox is really messed up
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:38:30 or they messed up because a game normally shouldnt be able to kill a wifi network
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:39:24 okay there its fixed itself
general 2019-10-15 17:39:58 what game is that?
general 2019-10-15 17:40:32 thanks love building things in games
reports 2019-10-22 03:22:02 Player: knipselis123
Reason: Using lagbombs to ruin the game
Evidence: http://prntscr.com/pmiskm
Link to profile: Can't get his profile because roblox tags it and when I use the google methored it shows another persons account and fake sites
general 2019-10-31 17:51:37 Damn Google Chrome keeps maxing my Disk out when launching Roblox it needs to CEASE
general 2019-11-01 18:17:12 "Account Disabled you cannot upload images of people wearing red arm bands"
general 2019-11-01 18:17:19 http://prntscr.com/pr8vaa
general 2019-11-01 18:17:23 sorry WHAT
general 2019-11-01 18:18:05 It's a part of a Japanese dress
general 2019-11-01 18:18:15 yet thats an ARM BAND to roblox
general 2019-11-01 18:18:26 it is an arm
general 2019-11-01 18:18:44 its apart of a dress yet roblox disabled my account with a warning for it lmao
general 2019-11-01 18:20:15 Roblox: IS THAT AN ARM BAND I SEE
general 2019-11-01 18:21:27 its like that problem with their bot where if you upload a square which is green it'll ban your account lul
general 2019-11-01 18:21:57 heck if I know
general 2019-11-01 18:22:17 probably thinks your doing the chroma key trick to hide text
general 2019-11-01 18:25:47 I was just gonna go into photoshop and edit the colour to be another colour but I'm not risking their twitchy bot to not ban me
general 2019-11-01 18:26:13 yo
general 2019-11-01 18:29:58 EH hey
general 2019-11-01 18:33:13 Chances are Roblox have some Open Source Image Recognition bot which scans an image and pairs it to a list of "not allowed images" to the uploaded one and if something looks a little like a not allowed image it pings it as bad and sends a warning instead of banning normally if its a bot doing it it'll just give you a warning but if its unsure it pings it to a Site Administrator and they review it
general 2019-11-01 18:33:44 explains the floored moderation
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 17:59:52 k then
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 18:00:23 I thought those are just mouse motors
general 2019-11-03 23:54:22 So those spyware bots are a thing now
general 2019-11-03 23:54:57 Who ever owns them broke a crap tone of Data Protection Laws along with Privacy Laws lol
general 2019-11-03 23:55:35 So rip them for being stupid

plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:14:04 epic dab
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:14:45 Dreadnoughts are bigger and more armed then a Battleship hence the new name
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:15:07 <@!414778672847781888> wrong
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:16:16 The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's HMS Dreadnought, made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as "dreadnoughts", and earlier battleships became known as "pre-dreadnoughts". Dreadnought was optimized for long-range battles. It had two revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships; and steam turbine propulsion.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:16:55 "an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships;"
bug-reports 2019-12-09 16:22:20 All numbers are changed to # no matter if its 1 2 or 3 etc so its impossible to add numbers to a build via the text or signs. don't really need an image as its self explanitory unless this is just the Roblox filter being quality again.
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:24:01 Okay so Roblox's String Filter is filtering out any numbers so now I cant add tail numbers to my build noice
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:17:24 If a plane wobbles side to side is that the result of lack of tail fin or some other force?
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:18:02 or is that just the result of speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:21:28 Nvm I just added an extra bit to the tail fin and it reduced wobble
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:21:52 yeah I just added a extra Delta and it reduced it but didnt fully stop it
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:22:16 its a big plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:22:24 with 4 side rockets and two main rockets
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:23:28 all it takes is someone to spawn in a bigger build and your plane suddenly stops reacting like it used to and is either hard to control or stop or it just doesnt fly
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:24:24 yeah everyone says its my PC yet I'm able to watch videos perfectly fine while roblox freaks out lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:24:59 see and I say to people in the game saying its physics lag and they're like NO ITS NO GET GOOD KID
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:25:01 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:25:59 and then you have to explain the difference between client lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:26:02 and server lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:38:54 its like youtube there are always dislikes even if its a wholesome video
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:40:14 my markings good yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:42:37 you could be talking about something sad and someone here is gonna respond "HA GAY"
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:44:27 yes will always be a good response for everything change my mind
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:44:53 yes
general 2019-12-10 14:45:43 you know what I don't get is Ambulances that have the word "Ambulance" on the front and its upside down
general 2019-12-10 14:45:53 like whos gonna read that unless you hit them and then they can read it
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:46:06 Yoda you are

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:47:47 this my home I stay peaceful protest
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:49:34 I'm litterly in a tank and you're not
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:49:38 your not my dad
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:52:44 get shut yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:53:32 <:TEApose:544705362859786251>
general 2019-12-10 20:44:27 How would one go about contacting Roblox to ask a question? do they have a email because all the contact pages are just tutorials or for account stuff
general 2019-12-10 20:45:37 would help if you told me the email instead of saying yes lol
general 2019-12-10 20:47:02 ?
general 2019-12-10 20:47:38 I'm just looking for the Official Roblox email to ask them a question
general 2019-12-10 20:50:30 yeah all I can find is Customer Service for account related problems
general 2019-12-10 20:50:39 and not development questions etc
general 2019-12-10 21:01:54 I'm mostly asking about off-site links which contain licenses or to comply with licenses and it doesnt help roblox is confusing as hell and not showing you their email to contact them for such questions
general 2019-12-10 21:06:48 because with the license I'm trying to comply with just requires a link to their site and we're all good but due to "No off-site links" and the fact that roblox in their doc about complying with licenses they say you must comply with the terms of a license
general 2019-12-10 21:06:59 i.e linking to comply
general 2019-12-10 21:10:37 also to bring up a question of possibly making a Licensing section for assets which you're buying the license from or using and wishing to comply
general 2019-12-12 16:21:14 not sure if this is a wide problem but if you open studio in any game and have instant major continues lag when moving mouse and camera and clicking buttons etc go into settings and change Graphics Mode to anything other then automatic and then wait a bit and then check if the lag goes away
general 2019-12-12 16:21:30 you can change it back once its stopped and it'll fix itself
general 2019-12-12 20:20:23 they do need to move it over in the corner
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:08:02 why 7 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:08:05 ones enough
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:09:13 lol was about to say all it takes is one person to get one of those and the others wont do anything lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:09:38 plus if someone wanted to see your IP and that then a VPN wont stop them if they really wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:11:09 location IP leans to a router IP
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:11:14 which does tell them where you are
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 21:12:17 ISP: Oh your using the internet let me just throttle that puppy and make it even harder to do your job HA

bug-reports 2019-12-18 15:49:35 When you blacklist someone and they leave soon after, when you go to spawn your build in it gets stuck and you can move or go back into build mode
bug-reports 2019-12-18 15:51:41 in other words you cant play and are stuck in build mode (this happens inside the PVP Arena)

plane-crazy 2019-12-18 16:19:16 because thats fiddly
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 16:19:59 the queen can also clear out the whole goverment and get new people but she doesnt because she'd make the citizens angry because they voted for those people
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 16:21:19 thats illegal backup
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 16:21:22 lol

plane-crazy 2019-12-19 09:28:06 it fly really well but wobbles a bit when VTOL
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 09:28:42 It's based off a SciFi Scrap Ship
creations-chat 2019-12-19 09:35:16 Added covers to the thrusters and also improved the design of it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 09:43:58 that person has been smited

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:51:30 commit none existance
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:05 you know whats worse then wishing death upon someone, eternal life
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:10 they never die
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:18 they watch everyone leave
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:32 then when the world explodes they'll be there

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:14 wait did you just sneakily tell me to die
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:17 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:45 sneaky mother fucker
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:47 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:57:08 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:57:32 zero marks failed this question
general 2019-12-25 15:35:45 when you watch a full video of a person making a 9 Cylinder Radial Solenoid Engine because your bored lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:39:40 motor2's are very hard for being used as Helicopter Rotors
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:39:46 so anything other then that you should be fine
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:40:15 yeah thats a bug
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:40:44 for some reason the blocks with the top part removed doesnt actually work with Motor2
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:03 sometimes it works
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:06 sometimes they dont move
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:16 or you could have a block which is stopping it from rotating
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:25 so make sure the area the motor rotates is clear
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:57 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:42:00 could be broken?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:42:27 because its defiantly not heavy and its not blocked try messing with the settings could be under powered
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:43:19 could be a bug with the script not loading
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:43:27 try saving and rejoining
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:42 are you using mouse movement
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:45 or servo?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:59 make sure the servo isnt toggled
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:18 he said default
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:37 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:51 could just not have enough torque to move that
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:32 Motor2 with any torque in water or in a fast build
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:35 breaks everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:47 so just use motors
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:13 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:16 toggle physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:18 on that
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:30 thats why you cant move because physics is disabled on your build
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:51 okay
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:09 when using a Anchor block always keep physics enabled
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:32 Motor2 is just broken I guess
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:59 use a normal motor for folds
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:49:13 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:50:36 idk then
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:58:48 Mac 10 ejection seat
general 2019-12-30 22:16:23 can I legally be allowed to slap a mother fucker 😂
general 2019-12-30 22:18:38 never say wedgy's again it triggers my troubled childhood memories
general 2019-12-30 22:18:54 *BOI*
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:00:57 Anyone recommend a keybind for Firework Rocket pods?
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:01:13 my flight controls are E up Q down and W A S D
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:02:30 It's sad that I cant use my extra two buttons on my mouse as a key bind FeelsBadMan
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:21 no motors get locked as well
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:25 when physics is not enabled
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:47 unless they updated it
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:02 all the times I've tried it does
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:09 so I just left anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:17 and now just make stable builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:45 I used to do it for recovery when testing
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:11:21 now I just add testing stuff to it and remove the parts I dont want
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:30 sometimes you gotta ignore detail and go for functionality
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:57 like right now the inside of my helicopters engine pod it has no wall
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:58 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:13:22 I'll have remove the whole upper part and move it up by one
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:13:25 to have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:15:35 just use an AA gun 4head
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:15:57 send post cards
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:16:31 or you could just get reference images on google and start building 5head
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:16:51 get them schematics ma dud
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:17:52 I'll dislike just because
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:09 I-i-it's not finished
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:16 okay I'll throw myself off the bridge
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:19 I'll see myself out
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:08 just look at that wip rocket arm
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:21 I build it to have it there it'll be changed
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:54 I have what ever the fuck this thing is
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:58 it's coax so
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:20:02 cool no tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:20:52 making none Coaxial kinda gets rid of the realism of tail rotor spinning unless you make an internal functional one and then make a design one on the outside
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:21:00 but then you'd have to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:21:39 Well I like big boi helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:09 just the thing is when you make a functional helicopter frame and then add details over the functional frame
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:17 you make the functional frame less functional
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:19 because weight
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:42 Also the thing with those guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:46 you have to make those things big
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:51 and it destroys the look
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:19 Because the guided missiles are ugly
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:41 you could have a clean looking helicopter or plane
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:47 and then have blocky guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:49 on the wings
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:08 which make the thing ugly sauce
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:20 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:40 if you want me to say the other word then I shall
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:59 the swearding
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:11 kidding it makes the build fucking ugly
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:45 also love the pfp
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:53 is that Shrekus
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:26:08 very nice 👌
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:26:57 should've blended the lighting of shreks face to match the surroundings
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:27:16 would look 👌
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:01 if your really good with it you could make it look like shreks face is a drawing and is meant to be there
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:45 also separate the hair and put it on another layer so the hair is over the face not the other way around
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:49 oof
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:29:12 👌
general 2020-01-02 23:29:27 we're here to discuss shrekus
general 2020-01-02 23:29:30 and the amazing art
general 2020-01-02 23:30:11 I could try to edit the hair so its over the face if you'd like
general 2020-01-02 23:31:03 if you saved it as a psd
general 2020-01-02 23:31:09 it would save all the layers
general 2020-01-02 23:31:20 well you can make changes and then save it as a psd
general 2020-01-02 23:31:28 so then you can go back and edit it at anytime
general 2020-01-02 23:31:47 just make sure to save a JPEG since some sites dont accept psd files
general 2020-01-02 23:32:55 oo nice
general 2020-01-02 23:35:28 pfft
general 2020-01-02 23:36:35 I was on about the one you have so I could easily just put the hair over the top
general 2020-01-02 23:36:36 lmao
general 2020-01-02 23:37:22 well you have a massive shrek face over the hair
general 2020-01-02 23:37:26 so
general 2020-01-02 23:37:29 lmao
general 2020-01-02 23:40:25 oh you also locked the images lmao
general 2020-01-02 23:40:40 jesus isnt happy
general 2020-01-02 23:45:34 his name means God Is Great
general 2020-01-02 23:45:51 it's nothing bad
general 2020-01-02 23:46:19 yes its associated with those people
general 2020-01-02 23:46:30 but it only means god is great
general 2020-01-02 23:47:11 if someone used a bible and blew things up you wouldn't take that as bad it's an object or word used wrongly
general 2020-01-02 23:47:48 no one is
general 2020-01-02 23:48:01 person asked why his name was verified and I just awnsered
general 2020-01-02 23:48:24 then thats his problem
general 2020-01-02 23:48:37 he was stupid then he'll be punished for that reason
general 2020-01-02 23:49:18 anyway I'll stop talking about the topic since people get heated and I am not here to cause fights lmao
general 2020-01-02 23:49:42 I'll steal your favourite cookies

general 2020-01-03 00:06:10 oh god that seems letterist
general 2020-01-03 00:06:29 how dare you
general 2020-01-03 00:06:39 C is just a half assed O and Q
general 2020-01-03 00:06:49 and the Q is a imposter of the O
general 2020-01-03 00:07:00 we dont talk about G
general 2020-01-03 00:07:06 we dont know what happened with G
general 2020-01-03 00:07:14 it all went down hill when his life left him
general 2020-01-03 00:07:17 wife
general 2020-01-03 00:07:19 not life
general 2020-01-03 00:07:20 but that too
general 2020-01-03 00:07:40 U is like V just V went on a sliming diet
general 2020-01-03 00:07:53 N is a half assed M
general 2020-01-03 00:08:04 okay now that's illegal we dont deal with numbers here
general 2020-01-03 00:08:18 we dont know what A is
general 2020-01-03 00:08:23 we're not that far
general 2020-01-03 00:08:39 okay thats heresy

general 2020-01-03 00:09:45 Ω α ß go go go move in move in
general 2020-01-03 00:10:03 Okay there is too much heresy letters here
general 2020-01-03 00:10:34 ß is the mating call for a Chad
general 2020-01-03 00:10:40 *epic dab*
general 2020-01-03 00:11:06 oh lord jesus
general 2020-01-03 00:11:22 haha e for my russian brothers
general 2020-01-03 00:11:52 who says it was alive in the first place
general 2020-01-03 00:11:54 👀
general 2020-01-03 00:12:20 okay now you see thats bad
general 2020-01-03 00:13:15 His status is bad his name just means God is great
general 2020-01-03 00:13:23 so yes he should be punished for his status
general 2020-01-03 00:13:27 and his pfp a little bit
general 2020-01-03 00:13:39 because he's obviously trying to be edgy
general 2020-01-03 00:14:24 what he's doing is obviously trying to be destructive and taking the religion in a bad light so he should be gone
general 2020-01-03 00:14:38 I agree there I didnt see his status till now
general 2020-01-03 00:15:24 well looking at his status I doubt he's actually the correct side of the religion or he's just being edgy
general 2020-01-03 00:16:37 <@!451025784228806656> I'm not talking about that I'm on about the name thats okay but him saying that in his status then I can't defend that because I dont agree with that either
general 2020-01-03 00:17:49 he's been beaned
general 2020-01-03 00:18:42 also been @ a few times so he cant pull the "I didnt see" card
general 2020-01-03 00:20:00 anyway we shall move on as all it takes is someone to have questionable opinions and then everyone will start fighting or some crap
general 2020-01-03 00:20:23 sadly yes
general 2020-01-03 00:20:42 lol

bug-reports 2020-04-14 17:56:57 Same for the other direction if it's placed on its side it'll not save but any other orientation it doesn't I've tested with changing its colours and if you paint the whole thing a colour it'll save but if you change one colour and thats it it'll save the settings but not the colours.
general 2020-04-14 19:04:52 Ew the smelly Exploiter thinks he's big money by showing none server side scripts kek
general 2020-04-14 19:06:21 When saving a part in a script its properties are massive
general 2020-04-14 19:10:16 has to save positional data as well
general 2020-04-14 19:10:20 and orientation
general 2020-04-14 19:14:09 Saving a part means you save everything about that part
general 2020-04-14 19:14:15 position
general 2020-04-14 19:14:20 orientation
general 2020-04-14 19:14:49 no
general 2020-04-14 19:16:19 because it isnt
general 2020-04-14 19:16:21 its there

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:44:23 Do ballast blocks effect the centre of mass?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:44:35 because it doesnt move when I change the values.
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:45:43 Because I did some changes and then reverted back and now the mass is off from where it was before and its messed up the whole build so I wanna just put it back to where it was
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:46:21 so I just edit it blind
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:46:31 and hope it balances out again
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:49:31 Legit all I did was remove a block replace it with something and then when it didnt work the way I wanted I put the block back and it some how shifted the entire centre of mass

plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:40:16 They need to add a feature to search for a block in your build like a config block because I have to rip a build apart just to find a part I forgot where it is located
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:40:33 or just a UI to config parts without actually having to click on the block if its hidden under parts.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:41:34 Thank you for your constructive feedback, I shall improve my way of suggesting features Mr eXoKay
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:46:46 are you having a stroke?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:51:49 When your trying to pretty up the under side curve of a ship but have no idea where to start.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:27 I mean this is a start kinda
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:45 thats the front
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:57 trying to smooth it off into a point
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:54:02 which is the line in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:18 well its better then the other
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:20 also its blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:23 what do you want from me
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:50 I'd flip the other parts and fit the gaps but apparently the game doesnt want me to
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:57:04 so by all means punch the wall all you want its your hand
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:24 Then thats not a wall thats just paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:28 and wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:56 a very crap wall then
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:00:05 Or the builders got told by the teachers they where experts in arts and crafts
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:00:14 and they went to go make buildings out of paper and wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:13 Okay then, apparently you're that type of person was being nice and talking but you're just gonna be like that.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:21 No my walls a brick
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:27 with wall paper and shiz
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:05 Not really an argument he just suddenly got offended and called me 12 even though I was being chill lol but cool guess we are now
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:28 Cardboard walls are better then paper, change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:46 but it's a superior paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:58 well actually it's made of wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:09 so the correct sentence is it's made of wood like paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:43 well its a different process for cardboard depends on the type of cardboard
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:52 like for boxes or like that thin cardboard paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:04:21 I loved that on TV
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:04:33 Was a top notch show
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:05:02 mate if you didn't learn how bubble-gum was made as a kid you have no childhood in my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:06:00 I stand by that
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:07:24 Yes a very intellectual conversation with a mix of drama in there a very good story from the aggressive start to the calm decline into friendship over a correct way to grow up
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:07:54 derp is a "nice" way of saying stupid
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:08:37 Well you see it's like the word "finna" people could just say "gonna" but here we are
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:12 Well sometimes slang words make sense
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:26 then you have words that don't really require slang
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:48 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:10:06 but till you bring me a person that slangs the word "to" then I will be impressed
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:10:25 there was an attempt

general 2020-05-24 16:28:26 yeah having a mouse in an enclosed space can over heat it and it'll explode
general 2020-05-24 16:28:33 batteries dont do well in heat
general 2020-05-24 16:30:11 I think the heat just drains the power held within it

general 2020-05-27 06:40:42 Since when where Tycoons classed as good games
general 2020-05-27 06:40:52 they're just idle games
general 2020-05-27 06:41:57 I never said Simulators where good games either
general 2020-05-27 06:42:04 indeed
general 2020-05-27 06:42:30 the idle ones are just copy and pastes
general 2020-05-27 06:43:39 Soon as I see a Simulator the save level as City Skylines then I'll have faith in the simulator genre
general 2020-05-27 06:43:45 but as of now I do not
general 2020-05-27 06:44:53 you ever have someone say something so off centred to what you're talking about you have no fucking idea how to respond to them

general 2020-05-27 06:47:51 oh

general 2020-05-30 07:23:50 Missiles are a balance of looks and actually flying
general 2020-05-30 07:25:36 It's easy to take out turret builds half of them dont anchor so you fire a missile at them but dont detonate it
general 2020-05-30 07:25:44 or just blow them up since they have small bases
general 2020-05-30 07:27:15 It's also easier to dodge people that spam a tone of rockets on their turrets since the server slows their rockets down but yet you dont slow down so you just fly past them also plus the rockets tracking was broken a while ago
general 2020-05-30 07:27:42 a < TL;DR a
general 2020-05-30 07:28:27 then read 4head
general 2020-05-30 07:29:33 I'm not sure why but apparently people don't get annoyed when you stretch a sentence into multiple sentences but soon as you say the same sentence just all in one message they scream that its too long
general 2020-05-30 07:29:57 no
general 2020-05-30 07:30:11 then they're an exploiter and report them 4head
general 2020-05-30 07:30:16 with vid proof
general 2020-05-30 07:30:30 no
general 2020-05-30 07:30:47 they aren't an ex loiterer
general 2020-05-30 07:30:57 they've put their loitering days behind them
general 2020-05-30 07:32:10 not sure if thats angles making it look weird or one of them have a really broken tail
general 2020-05-30 07:32:46 ah thats why one has a flat tail

general 2020-05-30 07:42:50 what you talking about thats the safest shell management I've ever seen
general 2020-05-30 07:43:52 they put all the shells in all the possible locations to be penetrated because they cant penetrate the tank if they hit the shells first *bigbrain*
general 2020-05-30 07:44:29 because rp is illegal

general 2020-05-30 07:49:26 wrong game KILL IT
general 2020-05-30 07:51:07 thats a succ cluster missile
general 2020-05-30 07:51:23 I expect the casing to eject and then rotate releasing the cluster bombs
general 2020-06-08 08:34:08 Christian is an entire religion
general 2020-06-08 08:34:15 he has ascended
general 2020-06-08 08:34:36 lip fang
general 2020-08-15 21:32:24 Let me know when a MBT or a Heavy tank takes up scout duties
general 2020-08-15 21:33:07 tracks exist <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 21:34:02 no the engine has a top speed the tracks have a weight / force limit until the joins break
general 2020-08-15 21:34:59 Just don't tell him the top speed of a MBT he'll go into shock <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 21:35:39 thats trials
general 2020-08-15 21:35:48 the point of that is to push it to the limits
general 2020-08-15 21:36:40 Well generally something that is very heavy tends to have a hard time if it doesnt have a powerful enough engine
general 2020-08-15 21:36:57 or other methods to assist it in climbing a slope
general 2020-08-15 21:37:22 All tanks are good offroad
general 2020-08-15 21:37:25 are you okay?
general 2020-08-15 21:38:10 the point of tracks are to spread the weight on the terrain
general 2020-08-15 21:39:32 because there isnt always a road where a MBT is deployed
general 2020-08-15 21:39:41 if all tanks stuck to roads they'd just get knocked out
general 2020-08-15 21:40:12 to scout?
general 2020-08-15 21:40:29 a scout tank is a tank to scout ahead of the more heavier tanks
general 2020-08-15 21:40:42 or provide assistance
general 2020-08-15 21:41:54 You do know MBTs can be scouts if there isnt any other tanks suited for scouting
general 2020-08-15 21:41:57 they're just louder
general 2020-08-15 21:42:12 so they tend to be put in a position and sit idle
general 2020-08-15 21:43:10 You know the tanks engine can be turned off right
general 2020-08-15 21:44:02 I mean a MBT sitting idle is quieter then a tank going max speed across terrain
general 2020-08-15 21:45:51 I'm not drunk enough to have this conversation
general 2020-08-15 21:46:52 Being not good doesnt mean it physically cant
general 2020-08-15 21:47:03 it just means its more likely to get bogged down in soft mud
general 2020-08-15 21:47:46 thats what tracks are invented for
general 2020-08-15 21:48:42 squad has nothing to do with irl vehicles
general 2020-08-15 21:49:25 MBTs can have their engine sounds suppressed MBTs can have modifications or generally are created to be quieter then older models
general 2020-08-15 21:49:57 yes but normally they can be mitigated with padding on the tracks
general 2020-08-15 21:50:54 Well what I said was IF there wasnt any lighter quieter tanks then they'd scout
general 2020-08-15 21:51:17 but generally there is naturally a plane or air support scouting anyway so none of the tanks will need to scout
general 2020-08-15 21:51:47 Well if there isnt a plane there then they'll appoint a scout vehicle?
general 2020-08-15 21:52:09 they dont just go "oh we have no plane guess we'll go blind"
general 2020-08-15 21:53:35 Also don't forget tanks dont go alone they generally have other supporting vehicles assisting
general 2020-08-15 21:54:34 A Urban warfare with an MBT is the last thing a tank operator wants to many positions to be flanked or pinned
general 2020-08-15 21:55:11 True
general 2020-08-15 21:55:31 yeah but that tend to pelt the town with shells before moving in
general 2020-08-15 21:56:21 Modern Warfare has switched to distance over close quarters
general 2020-08-15 21:58:03 Wheeled vehicles tend to need to have modifications like bigger tires installed or other stuff before they're taken off road
general 2020-08-15 21:58:20 but if its dry then they dont need it
general 2020-08-15 21:58:35 but if its wet then yes they'll need to have more steps to avoid it being stuck
general 2020-08-15 21:58:58 that too
general 2020-08-15 21:59:21 But normally the reason for tanks being abandoned is being bogged down and under fire
general 2020-08-15 21:59:37 Oh I've seen that video I cringed
general 2020-08-15 21:59:43 it mangled the skirting lmao
general 2020-08-15 22:00:34 I think it detracted itself and hit the skirt which then popped it back on but left the skirt mangled in the back wheel
general 2020-08-15 22:00:51 which then disabled it from moving
general 2020-08-15 22:01:19 Could've been bad maintence
general 2020-08-15 22:01:55 Challenger is pretty 👌
general 2020-08-15 22:02:22 "cringe poop engine"
general 2020-08-15 22:03:02 well the land rover was never supposed to be used for taking a crap tone of fire
general 2020-08-15 22:03:44 Not sure why people keep saying that because the Land Rover was used to as logic not taking multiple direct fire
general 2020-08-15 22:04:59 Most old tanks had their issues
general 2020-08-15 22:05:35 Well we where being bombed 24/7
general 2020-08-15 22:05:39 by the germans
general 2020-08-15 22:06:39 <@!310863132727836672> We're an island plus we had to bail France out because their stupid asses kept surrendering
general 2020-08-15 22:07:17 then we had to pay the US to help us
general 2020-08-15 22:07:25 while still being bombed
general 2020-08-15 22:08:25 Because he asked why we became weaker during it
general 2020-08-15 22:08:56 Yeah because their stupid asses surrendered
general 2020-08-15 22:09:23 yeah that messed up the other countries around them
general 2020-08-15 22:10:11 We was in the EU which is legit founded by Germany and is currently ran by Germany <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 22:10:46 Sure
general 2020-08-15 22:11:12 Not even going to go into this topic because it's way too political
general 2020-08-15 22:12:30 Then you see China and the US and what ever the fuck is happening with NK and the US
general 2020-08-15 22:12:53 North Korea
general 2020-08-15 22:14:29 sank
general 2020-08-15 22:15:03 Still has the hull though
general 2020-08-15 22:15:14 no shit
general 2020-08-15 22:15:44 I thought it was Maus
general 2020-08-15 22:16:38 Actually lets look at old french tanks <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 22:17:21 The earlier french tanks where so small and adorable though
general 2020-08-15 22:18:52 Oh god now I cant unsee the old french tanks look like Warhammer tanks
general 2020-08-15 22:18:54 just smaller
general 2020-08-15 22:18:58 I cant unsee it
general 2020-08-15 22:19:30 
general 2020-08-15 22:20:52 that tank would destroy a Maus in one shot
general 2020-08-15 22:21:43 I like that thats an actual tank turret just sitting on the side of a road lmao
general 2020-08-15 22:22:49 the turret doesnt have left and right controls
general 2020-08-15 22:22:56 you have to turn the whole body like a fixed turret tank
general 2020-08-15 22:23:49 because discord is slow
general 2020-08-15 22:24:28 Oh there
general 2020-08-15 22:24:45 must be a queue for embedding <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 22:25:17 well tell it to die quietly and slower
general 2020-08-15 22:25:21 so you have more internet
general 2020-08-15 22:25:47 well the fact its already dying means it failed that already
general 2020-08-15 22:25:55 so why not just tell it to be slower about it
general 2020-08-15 22:26:27 What does your ping bounce off a room full of angled mirrors
general 2020-08-15 22:26:59 so it bounces off a room full of angled mirrors
general 2020-08-15 22:28:50 Watch out you'll piss off the overly angry people that are for some reason irrationally angry at people that like anime
general 2020-08-15 22:29:27 it has floating carrier decks
general 2020-08-15 22:29:56 why tho
general 2020-08-15 22:30:30 I see people that just are overly angry at people that like anime are just like really old angry grandpas and grumble at kids when ever they see them
general 2020-08-15 22:31:23 I mean if they arent hurting you why give them shit
general 2020-08-15 22:32:04 y tho
general 2020-08-15 22:33:40 Apparently fur suits cost a shit tone
general 2020-08-15 22:33:54 dont actually know how much
general 2020-08-15 22:34:19 I thought that was goth clothing
general 2020-08-15 22:34:38 if you wear gucci but I'm sorry you must go
general 2020-08-15 22:35:13 I'm sorry bob your the weakest link, goodbye
general 2020-08-15 22:36:06 the world has had enough wars
general 2020-08-15 22:36:11 also 2020 has it all booked out
general 2020-08-15 22:36:14 so no wars sorry
general 2020-08-15 22:37:01 <@!505835349889777685> 2020 called Cthulhu was cancelled
general 2020-08-15 22:37:56 No matter what there is always another country beating someone up
general 2020-08-15 22:38:01 I mean cyber attacks happen daily
general 2020-08-15 22:38:09 and every country is just pelting each other daily
general 2020-08-15 22:38:16 via cyber attacks
general 2020-08-15 22:39:09 because you are all gun crazy
general 2020-08-15 22:39:24 someone mentions oil and oh god off they go again
general 2020-08-15 22:41:24 America is weird they keep judging other countries goverments while they're currently trying to strangle their own president
general 2020-08-15 22:43:15 kechoo
general 2020-08-15 22:43:49 why does that car look like its just hit something and is scared for life
general 2020-08-15 22:44:05 understandable
general 2020-08-15 22:44:40 Probably hit the back end of another car <:flushedsquare:705487160005886003>
general 2020-08-15 22:45:20 new high score
general 2020-08-15 22:45:48 thank god those cars crashed and saved that balloon from its kidnappers
general 2020-08-15 22:46:33 <@!155149108183695360> no u
general 2020-08-15 22:46:48 they removed the headlights and replaced them with smaller lower headlights
general 2020-08-15 22:47:32 what spoiler?
general 2020-08-15 22:47:37 oh that thing
general 2020-08-15 22:49:28 any low down car will get shredded when they meet a speed bump
general 2020-08-15 22:50:27 I mean who has the patience to see a speed bump then proceed to park up before it and then take their bumpers off then slowly drive over it and then reattach their bumpers that just takes effort
general 2020-08-15 22:50:59 the people that have stupid bumpers
general 2020-08-15 22:51:38 <@!505835349889777685> normally racing low bumpers have clip on that break off in a crash
general 2020-08-15 22:51:46 idk why
general 2020-08-15 22:51:48 dont ask me
general 2020-08-15 22:51:52 but they do
general 2020-08-15 22:52:06 because they just do
general 2020-08-15 22:53:13 if you put eyes on the sides of a Abrams it looks like a durpy tank
general 2020-08-15 22:53:22 now you cant unsee it
general 2020-08-15 22:53:25 your welcome
general 2020-08-15 22:53:53 yes
general 2020-08-15 22:54:00 aurycorrect is the best
general 2020-08-15 22:54:16 it's the panicle of human engineering
general 2020-08-15 22:54:43 yes I spelt that wrong
general 2020-08-15 22:54:53 and I'm not even gonna correct it
general 2020-08-15 22:55:10 he died
general 2020-08-15 22:55:16 mhm
general 2020-08-15 22:56:11 That jeep barely has any movement in the wheels
general 2020-08-15 22:57:43 Have you seen those military vehicles going full speed over bumps and the cabin stays still and the wheels go mad, I just see that but more destructive half way through
general 2020-08-15 22:58:16 yeah
general 2020-08-15 22:58:37 it's got a single cabin but its got these long arms attached to wheels
general 2020-08-15 22:59:28 a Humvee would get shredded by an IED
general 2020-08-15 22:59:33 flat bottom
general 2020-08-15 22:59:36 =bad
general 2020-08-15 23:00:17 well generally they dont want the twice as expensive MRAP to hit the IED either
general 2020-08-15 23:00:32 the wheels tend to go flying off
general 2020-08-15 23:01:03 and has a V shaped underside to deflect IEDs
general 2020-08-15 23:02:23 Only down side is the MRAP never survives
general 2020-08-15 23:02:44 I mean the crew does
general 2020-08-15 23:02:47 but it doesnt
general 2020-08-15 23:03:23 It's like big ass APC but bigger
general 2020-08-15 23:04:26 apparently Toyotas are the most used vehicle for technicals
general 2020-08-15 23:05:06 only question is where the f do they keep finding them
general 2020-08-15 23:05:50 they dont make the vehicles themselves
general 2020-08-15 23:05:55 I think they just steal them
general 2020-08-15 23:06:33 I mean there was that picture of a convoy of stolen new Toyotas that where converted to technicals
general 2020-08-15 23:07:38 *hm this big cargo ship has a lot of Toyotas for some reason*
general 2020-08-15 23:08:07 D
general 2020-08-15 23:08:53 When ever you see a Technical its always later on destroyed rip all the lost Toyotas
general 2020-08-15 23:09:25 normally there is nothing left
general 2020-08-15 23:09:40 they always get taken out first since they can rip up foot soldiers
general 2020-08-15 23:10:58 normally a missile any where would completely destroy it
general 2020-08-15 23:11:18 or an A-10 just melts it <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 23:12:52 Have you seen the size of the bullet holes an A-10 leaves on a vehicle the insides of a car is just melted
general 2020-08-15 23:14:01 I mean the germans then used to like to hide in populated cities
general 2020-08-15 23:14:12 bageetee
general 2020-08-15 23:14:58 I mean its a bomb once you drop it you dont really have any control over it
general 2020-08-15 23:15:26 yeah thats now not back then
general 2020-08-15 23:15:41 v2 rocket
general 2020-08-15 23:17:02 what like the titan fall pistol
general 2020-08-15 23:17:15 homing bullet
general 2020-08-15 23:18:41 dont really need it if you have a gun that can lock onto multiple targets and then fire a burst hitting all of them without having to aim
general 2020-08-15 23:19:10 that gun was really OP tbh lmao
general 2020-08-15 23:20:00 it had a max of 3 or 4 idk
general 2020-08-15 23:20:10 but it would always to head shots
general 2020-08-15 23:21:13 I think it was meant for room clearing but people just ran around with it and locked onto everything lol
general 2020-08-15 23:22:13 thats the point
general 2020-08-15 23:22:19 titan fall <:xdd:714935125418442812>
general 2020-08-15 23:22:52 the Ogre was a good build

general 2020-09-02 08:07:00 I remember having like half of a lucid dream I ripped a door off the hinges panicked and woke up

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 19:27:23 For some reason my build is bouncing constantly when on the ground even though its stiffness and dampening has been increased, is this a weight issue?
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 19:28:13 It's a back heavy vehicle I'll lower those settings and see if that helps
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 19:29:18 https://gyazo.com/b4087f67190086e2464dcbeb4f5a1909 it's doing this for visual reference
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 19:30:40 I've turned the settings for the springs all the way down and its still bouncing
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 19:31:10 I have some tanks on it to even out the weight could that be the issue?

general 2020-09-20 14:05:33 It got popular naturally over the time of the lockdowns
general 2020-09-20 14:05:43 its a good group game to play
general 2020-09-20 14:07:12 They didnt really pay anyone to play it
general 2020-09-20 14:07:30 it naturally became popular again because of the lock downs its a good group game to play
general 2020-09-20 14:07:34 same as Jackbox
general 2020-09-20 14:09:14 Another normal day in Roblox
general 2020-09-20 14:10:25 yeah it got popular over the lock downs
general 2020-09-20 14:10:49 it's only made by two developers
general 2020-09-20 14:11:05 supported by donations
general 2020-09-20 14:11:28 It isn't its a legit game

general 2020-09-20 14:12:36 Okay well you keep on hating then?
general 2020-09-20 14:13:13 It's just called mental fortitude
general 2020-09-20 14:13:30 by just not being addicted to stuff and you have the power to say no and stop
general 2020-09-20 14:14:11 <@456226577798135808> yes thank you for your contribution to the conversation with your "."
general 2020-09-20 14:14:20 you
general 2020-09-20 14:14:33 thank you please teach us your ways
general 2020-09-20 14:14:44 😎
general 2020-09-20 14:16:04 this is the google explanation of it >>>Mental fortitude is a necessary element of success. Mental fortitude is defined as the ability to focus on and execute solutions when in the face of uncertainty or adversity. If we break under pressure, if we lose patience with the process we're being challenged with, it can easily drive us to quit prematurely.
general 2020-09-20 14:16:55 I get bored from games fast so I naturally can't get addicted KEK
general 2020-09-20 14:17:25 It's a cute little TTT game on a space station
general 2020-09-20 14:17:32 how is it bad?
general 2020-09-20 14:20:26 I had an Ad for Mafia City randomly
general 2020-09-20 14:20:45 probably a person being very late to the wagon and tried to play an Ad for it
general 2020-09-20 14:21:06 I don't think Mafia City was an actual game
general 2020-09-20 14:21:17 it was just a scam ad I think that became a meme

general 2020-11-19 19:27:37 frogge
general 2020-11-19 19:28:43 no turn signals I am ANGER
general 2020-11-19 19:29:53 <@!726156798603821107> yes because green lights cast green light 🤯
general 2020-11-19 19:30:50 If you cast a light onto tarmac it'll have the light casted on the surface no one said anything about reflecting
general 2020-11-19 19:31:19 the road doesnt start shooting light from itself just because you shine a torch on it
general 2020-11-19 19:32:08 a torch would still allow a object that reflects light to reflect the light from the torch weak or not
general 2020-11-19 19:32:52 whats your point about a torch being weak in this conversation?
general 2020-11-19 19:33:40 No one said anything about the road reflecting I was saying to the other person that the road doesnt shine light off of itself when a light source shines on it
general 2020-11-19 19:34:36 Then if you can scroll up why are you still talking about a reflective road???
general 2020-11-19 19:35:38 Because some lights are green in some places in tunnels
general 2020-11-19 19:36:02 bright white light in the dark in a tunnel is blinding so a colour dull in tone wouldn't blind you soon as you enter it
general 2020-11-19 19:36:42 yellow is also a colour which helps with night time driving
general 2020-11-19 19:36:56 just some newer tunnels have white light anyway just not blindingly bright
general 2020-11-19 19:37:37 ?
general 2020-11-19 19:38:01 did you keyboard switch keys around?
general 2020-11-19 19:38:09 then type it
general 2020-11-19 19:38:27 cmd /c"echo off|clip"
general 2020-11-19 19:38:44 tyep
general 2020-11-19 19:38:45 it]
general 2020-11-19 19:38:48 it
general 2020-11-19 19:38:48 type
general 2020-11-19 19:38:52 if you cant copy and paste
general 2020-11-19 19:39:11 why do you not have those symbols what Chinese keyboard do you have?
general 2020-11-19 19:39:42 is it an english keyboard or is it QWERTY or the other one
general 2020-11-19 19:39:56 then you should have the keys
general 2020-11-19 19:40:19 which keys do you not have?
general 2020-11-19 19:40:23 | or /
general 2020-11-19 19:40:26 or ""
general 2020-11-19 19:40:55 he's saying he doesnt have the | or / key's on his keyboard for some strange reason
general 2020-11-19 19:41:20 I havent a clue what weird keyboard he has that its missing key's lol
general 2020-11-19 19:42:18 Is his keyboard just a baguette?
general 2020-11-19 19:44:00 also get a keyboard that isnt missing keys lmao
general 2020-11-19 19:46:56 how about roblox just not break the copy and paste? thats a thought
general 2020-11-19 19:47:20 no roblox is the issue it breaks the copy and paste sometimes when the client is closed
general 2020-11-19 19:48:26 so what you're saying is Deja Vu was the reason we found out you have a strange keyboard both missing the | and / key's
general 2020-11-19 19:49:12 well just dont have 1000 ping then
general 2020-11-19 19:49:29 poob
general 2020-11-19 19:49:47 let me guess you have 500 tabs open

general 2020-11-19 19:50:58 and chrome will take those 2 gb's
general 2020-11-19 19:52:53 oh no a game is popular what ever shall we do
general 2020-11-19 19:53:32 what about it?
general 2020-11-19 19:53:46 so?
general 2020-11-19 19:53:52 games update daily
general 2020-11-19 19:54:02 thats the fault of roblox
general 2020-11-19 19:54:11 they failed to update their servers
general 2020-11-19 19:54:21 If Roblox is lagging
general 2020-11-19 19:54:25 then its roblox's fault
general 2020-11-19 19:54:27 not the game
general 2020-11-19 19:56:24 There is mods just there is three and thats it and they have no plan on adding any more
general 2020-11-19 19:57:37 Who would blame Rickje Roblox is an untrustworthy place sadly everyone has arteria motives
general 2020-11-19 19:58:38 No matter what if you have a report feature it's going to be used and its going to be abused
general 2020-11-19 19:59:39 Even with a blacklist it'll still be abused because a person would need to abuse it to then be added to the list
general 2020-11-19 20:00:16 what do you mean by others?
general 2020-11-19 20:00:51 those are suggestions moderated by the server moderators not in-game reports
general 2020-11-19 20:02:14 If they said anything nsfw in chat then report it to roblox else they cant do anything about it
general 2020-11-19 20:02:42 then report their account to roblox and leave it be
general 2020-11-19 20:03:46 it's still public facing
general 2020-11-19 20:05:52 If I was given money for every time someone uses another persons profile picture as a point to silence another person I'd be richer then the Amazon CEO
general 2020-11-19 20:07:14 Listen the game doesnt have in-game reports and it hasnt fallen into 4chan levels of hell so I'd say its not really needed
general 2020-11-19 20:07:30 trolls come make some random build get bored and leave thats pretty much it

general 2020-11-19 20:09:17 not all servers have it enabled
general 2020-11-19 20:10:21 <@!269859413680979970> I mean you put that as your status and then joined a public server with moderation what did you expect to happen?
general 2020-11-19 20:13:57 nil
general 2020-11-19 20:15:21 I mean you did draw attention to yourself
general 2020-11-19 20:15:44 your profile picture I'm guessing
general 2020-11-19 20:16:38 yes they saw your profile picture decided that wasnt nsfw and then probably clicked your profile to see your status or you just was unlucky and they saw it
general 2020-11-19 20:17:38 they have a rule about no nsfw statuses so you was already passed that rule and they took action
general 2020-11-19 20:18:41 statuses are public facing meaning ALL servers and all people in those servers can see it
general 2020-11-19 20:19:00 if you said something in one server then only that server would see it
general 2020-11-19 20:19:26 but if you put it as a status all the servers could see it and if they have a rule against it then they can just kick you thats just how servers go
general 2020-11-19 20:21:06 just have a server with all the members having the same nickname and profile picture as you and everyone the same role colour and see how fast they develop ways of telling each other apart lol
general 2020-11-19 20:21:59 he said the r quick shame bell them
general 2020-11-19 20:23:10 how would an attacker go about even doing anything you'd spend more time wondering where the neck starts and ends

general 2020-11-19 20:30:48 <@!720751430595772418> technically yes
general 2020-11-19 20:31:14 but I am not sure if a cannon would deliver enough kinetic energy
general 2020-11-19 20:31:27 I mean if you fired said person from a rail gun in space possibly yes
general 2020-11-19 20:32:18 ^

general 2020-11-19 20:34:10 everybody gangster till your RPG-7 turns around after being shot
general 2020-11-19 20:35:05 turret builds with a crap tone of random blocks all around it are the worst
general 2020-11-19 20:35:11 until you just carpet bomb it
general 2020-11-19 20:36:35 Wonder if you can fly a plane a full speed with a blade on the front and slice someones build in half kek
general 2020-11-19 20:37:26 someone with a blimp flying around and you just go mach20 into them and slice their build in half
general 2020-11-19 20:38:39 well that sucks because its a submarine
general 2020-11-19 20:39:33 it's PCC you can make anything and then turn it into a submarine death machine
general 2020-11-19 20:40:43 how I imagine fancy writing to be like
