creations-chat 2019-11-28 17:07:15 It's definitely the conveyors
creations-chat 2019-11-28 17:07:24 None of my other vehicles have that problem
creations-chat 2019-11-28 17:11:10 So conveyors make my processor implode I guess
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:11:52 I use a rudder type thing

plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:18:13 in the end it basically sent my vehicle into the quantum realm
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:19:39 It takes either a lot of helium, or a lot of magnets
creations-chat 2020-04-03 19:43:13 Impressive
