general 2021-12-09 09:49:39 When I looked at the Dolphin Brain I thought it was abnormal ball sacks
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 09:58:25 Question: Alright I've played Plane Crazy a very long time ago back when it had Outlines on blocks and when I came back like months ago, I don't see the outlines anymore. Is there anyway I can see it again or did they decide to remove it? because It's kinda helpful in builds
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 09:59:08 <a:thanossnappedmecri:809464321217396776>
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 09:59:20 They should have at least like made it an option
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 09:59:31 instead of removing it entirely
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 09:59:38 because its useful af on building

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:20:28 fr
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:21:00 I accidentally spawned my tank there (In the water) and legit 3 planes 1 pt boat and 1 ship immediately gang banged me

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:22:56 kinda like squares
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:24:27 One of the things that amuses me in the game is that when a Shredder (any form) spawns, the entire fucking server will team up against the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:24:48 I love this game
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:26:05 fr, I legit fought a f-22 using a Dauntless Dive bomber
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:26:58 or an entire Shredder ball with all guns using a Cold War era jet
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:27:34 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:29:35 Earlier I was Dog Fighting with 2 planes, a Stuka on ketamine and a normal jet and the Stuka in heroin keeps is faster than all the planes in the server and turns extremely fast
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 12:29:45 then he bombed the jet midair

1. Japan did a shit ton of war crimes in the pacific, China and the Philippines.
2. Japan bombed Pearl Harbour without Warning
3. It's war baby what are you gonna do
4. 9/11 killed American innocents when it wasn't in war
5. Japan won't surrender so target practice <a:trolled:826571033510543420>
general 2021-12-11 03:37:17 <:what:895018978915778572>
general 2021-12-11 03:42:06 1. War crimes aren't preventable as always but the US did a small amount of them compared to the Axis war crimes
2. *~~To get oil~~* to actually **try** and fix countries and prevent terrorism
3. America wasn't at war at 9/11 so technically people in 9/11 was more innocent that Japanese ones <:Troll:910028939727085610> 
4. So your saying the Al Qaeda aren't terrorists?
5. I think if they're gonna intervene they need to do it right instead of fucking it up, Every intervention worked until it just didn't starting from the Vietnam war
