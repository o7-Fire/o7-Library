creations-chat 2021-02-08 22:41:28 <@!389516889501728779> your tiny sail boat put a smile on my face
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:14:03 <@!322926915336011787> your dual glock 18s look amazing
creations-chat 2021-04-03 19:53:08 <@!272165213372153856> as a Canadian, I approve of the story behind your vehicle and I like the way the interior looks but I find the exterior does not fit with the luxurious look that the interior holds, if the wheels were made functional and the exterior were to be different (maybe slightly changed or a different, sleek, and more curved model) then I feel the interior would blend nicely with the new exterior.
