general 2020-06-28 15:58:27 i made jetpack beanos float
general 2020-06-28 15:59:16 pls no
general 2020-06-28 16:00:54 what speed does the fastest plane go at?
general 2020-06-28 16:00:56 in game?
general 2020-06-28 16:01:37 think i reached it
general 2020-06-28 16:01:43 using JETPACK BEANOS
general 2020-06-28 16:02:16 what does it say when u reach infinite? <@!287459677611098114>
general 2020-06-28 16:02:38 oof
general 2020-06-28 16:02:51 JETPACK BEANOS probably reaches like 5k

general 2020-06-29 17:37:37 i made a tiny flying mech#
general 2020-06-29 17:55:19 i made it using rocketmon's design for mechs
general 2020-06-29 17:55:39 then i added 2 hover thrusters and a small propeller
general 2020-06-29 17:55:50 and 2 control surfaces
general 2020-06-29 17:55:56 it can move around in the air
general 2020-06-29 17:56:03 but it cant rly move on ground :/
general 2020-06-29 17:56:25 i needed to remove the mechanics for turns so it was light enough
general 2020-06-29 17:56:33 it can only walk forward on ground
creations-chat 2020-06-29 17:57:12 lol
general 2020-06-29 17:57:34 im gonna check its speed
general 2020-06-29 18:00:03 maxes at 150
general 2020-06-29 18:00:05 not bad
general 2020-06-29 18:19:48 does anyone know how i can add a less violent turning mechanism on my mech than propellers?
