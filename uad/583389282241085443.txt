plane-crazy 2021-04-06 20:56:05 turret should be odd and pvp weapons on in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 20:58:20 because you need a center point to put motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 21:07:03 i feel like the jetpack noise is slowly driving me insane
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:54:05 IDK if this is intentional but sometimes my edit menu icon layout gets messed up (buttons in the wrong order from what it is normally)

plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:07:35 suspensions are too buggy for gear tilt to be accurate
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:07:42 (in my exp)
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:24:51 honestly a clutch ~ish thing so that cars are sorta accurate
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:45:42 prob fine for any average sized boats
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:45:48 same
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:46:27 i just think its a shame that there arent torps
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:46:33 or a sonar cmera setting
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:47:22 and guns shoot through terrain
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:47:31 and water
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:47:37 which is weird
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:48:02 wedge bomb
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:48:40 or a cylander that onl has one attachment point
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:49:10 pylons which could act as disconectors
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:50:33 also a block that properly conects to wings instead of using half block
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:51:41 bigger and smaller water wheels would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:51:56 especially for custom jet engines

plane-crazy 2021-05-02 15:25:05 it doesnt help that it physics throttles my computer
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 15:25:26 like it says its going 300 but a jetpack can catch up
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 15:25:46 there isnt one as long as it can fit inside the plot its good
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 15:27:01 theres a limit for individual blocks if thats whet youre asking

plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:35:05 program*

plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:36:14 but aaa
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:37:06 but if youre going fast enough it doesnt matter you get more range
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:37:36 your not hitting things 1 km away with a firework
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:37:45 hes angering you
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:38:13 my point is you wont hit things at that distance
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:38:39 the point isnt the total distance of the firework its the distance youre engaging
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:38:46 the other planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:39:31 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:39:59 no but 20 range isnt enough for aa
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:40:22 n o
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:41:06 mmhmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:41:28 guns are ok but theyre annoying to get on target and ddeal damage

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:16:46 I was think more like specific creations to create but ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:18:05 Shall come back to you for that
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:20:00 I remember I made a one cylinder engine powered by only pistons once
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:06:25 Well there must be one block that isn’t
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:06:48 No it’s just impossible
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:06:52 Mmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:07:23 Putting your name on list so that I can do this later
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:07:27 When I have time
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:12:24 Ez
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:23:14 Wonder what the conversion of plane crazy speed to kph is
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:27:48 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:28:38 Isn’t it meters per sec then
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:29:20 So that’ll be 1669 mps
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:30:02 Or Mach 4.6
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:30:14 Wait no Mach 4.86
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:30:44 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:30:51 That means I’m still right
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:31:02 ~3feet in on meter
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:31:08 So Mach 4.86
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:31:32 Is your speed in this image
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:32:36 It’s close enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:33:15 I used the assumption 3.3333 stud = one meter
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:34:15 -_-
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:34:47 Whic means that helpfully all of my supersonic craft go at least Mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:35:02 Or are supposed to be supersonic
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:35:55 I’m in mobile typing this cuz I’m on the AirPower
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:36:04 -_-

plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:47:52 yea unless it can go faster then 600-700 its not worth being big
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:10 big planes in my experience dont
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:40 my 2k part b-29 can survive a shredder for up to 5 mins max
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:44 not worth it

plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:53:59 y no perm day
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:55:01 if rockets were more like aim9bs with a 1 min cooldown and 2 max per build + countermeasures it wouldnt be too bad i think (correct if wrong)

plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:54:12 midway ( the main showdown) was entirely fought by carriers, and the fleets intentions, (us and jap) were not to approach with ship but with planes, and such ship borne torpedoes (not plane torpedoes) were useless on an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:57:03 thats what the screening fleet is for (the destroyers, cruisers) that were around the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:57:13 so most likely, no
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:57:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:06 shadow the torpedo tubes were on the screening fleet, not the carriers
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:49 i think so but i cant think of any
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:04:50 destroyers had torps
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:05:03 apperently some cruisers had depth charges
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:06:02 that also wouldnt really make sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:06:49 carriers were already notorious for exploding so why add more explosive to them (this is irl)
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:08:31 well not exploding but definetly catching on fire
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:10:07 i mean how many times has a carrier specifically caught on fire from just a couple bombs or by accident
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:10:18 forrestal in 67
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:10:49 pretty sure the hornet and the enterprise had caught on fire at least once
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:13:03 the hiryu was evacuated because of fires
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:13:14 my point being why risk it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:13:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:14:34 im pretty sure some early carriers had them but they were later removed
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:20:41 im pretty sure this is a ww2 or even pre ww2 carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:24 ill say dont go with secondary on a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:32 rockets are heavy flak
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:38 guns are guns
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:22:09 and fireworks are short range
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:22:45 ww2 aircraft carriers definitely had high tech jets and ciws on them, u kno
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:34 yes but the specific carrier being talked about is from ww2
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:56 this one
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:28:24 yea pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:31:15 as long as the aa wasnt removed, not much
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:31:30 if it was aa then you trade offence for defence
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:31:43 a very large glass cannon
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:34:56 and honestly in plane crazy the more aa the better
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:35:16 its pretty hard to defend yourself in a carrier in such a small map
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:35:52 if radar and a larger bvr map was introduced carriers would suddenly become a lot more feaasible
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:36:55 maybe not auto aim but a lead indicator for certain weapons
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:37:07 and better missiles
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:37:28 and actual flak (like proxy)
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:38:52 i could feel the shredders crying as you snip them with flak and lead from across the map
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:39:05 also actual cannons would be great
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:39:41 nah
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:40:42 i have a feeling most shredders play on their grans macintosh and therefore only go after targets that are close
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:41:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:41:16 and maybe recoil to stop them from becoming broken]
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:42:24 mmmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:43:10 and certain setups use up more "slots" then others
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:01 so like you could have either 12 normal rockets or 2 aim9bs
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:08 but not both
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:32 or 1 aim9 and 6 normal rockets

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:58:42 Lava is being super laggy with big builds for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:59:28 It wasn't like that before to my knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:59:40 I remember my bad PC could handle it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:00:10 Now even good PC gets crashed by lava
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:05:01 Like 600 blocks crashes

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:04:13 does are servos
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:04:16 those
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:56:30 i doesnt have that much space
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:56:38 especially the nose
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:56:49 i have full landing gear on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:58:50 
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:58:59 
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:59:16 the rest is either engines or main gear
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 20:59:44 also the flaps are on the actual swing wing so i dont know how to hide the servos there
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 21:21:23 The fuck is what
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 21:21:41 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 21:21:44 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 21:26:42 yes i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 22:19:08 cannot its  variable sweep wing so i cant put it on the body, and on the wing itll either not sweep or look uglier\
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 22:20:59 straight up do not care
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 22:21:47 i do not care
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 22:22:48 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 22:22:52 huh

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 18:59:18 wait how does one make unguided rockets because
 mine just bug out and float in front of where they are launched
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:26:36 my only hueg thing is like a 3400 block plane and it lags my pretty good computer
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:30:00 
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:30:17 its a ac
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:30:55 its on the ground apperently
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:31:34 i only have mi 8 as a good helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:31:49 sometime in need to convert it into an attack heli
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:34:59 mi8
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:35:22 not really
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:36:23 whats hard is to balance and to make it look somewhat historical
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:38:23 yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:38:34 they wither pitch up or down in the water
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:38:37 either
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:38:50 and its super annoying to fix with engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:41:31 send to me too
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:43:39 also ive just realized that helicopter tech is one of the easiest challenges to complete
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:45:20 looks like the bootleg concorde
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:47:06 by the size of the cockpit its going to endup being in the thousands
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:47:58 bit rude ngl
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:50:02 what that
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:51:01 damn why is there a 1x1 block behind the triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:51:09 that looks wack
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:51:42 looks like a 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:51:52 send link
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:52:24 yea you should have used triangle and then triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:52:33 1x1 block looks wack
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:52:57 then the top becomes half triangle wedge and it looks better
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:54:05 wish you could make wing perices itno glass
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:54:10 into
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:54:44 yeah i saw
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:55:44 mmm if you change it into traingle wedge youd need to camera lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:55:52 thatll probably be annoying
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:58:02 its when you put a camera down and then change where the camera looks and it (for some reason) changes the location of the blocks attached to it
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:58:37 thats what they all say
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 22:59:38 oh nevermind they patched it
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 23:00:32 theres a video by justrens about it i think

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:19 And planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:41 VTOL requirements it does
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:59 Not heli tech
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:06 F35b is a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:08 It counts
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:28 Because you are doing vtol engineer right
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:39 Yea then it’s fine
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:50 It will
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:58 No f35b works
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:40:26 You can make vtols that fit requirements for vtol engineer without a heli style craft like the osprey

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:20 Gotta get on that
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:00 Just make sure it can transition from modes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:08 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:15 Can it fly like a normal plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:35 Can it move in vtol mode
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:44 Then it’s good right

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:54:01 L cope seethe
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:55:30 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:56:45 Stuff that looks professional and therefore motor loocked pretty much always score more
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:56:49 Unless it’s really big
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:57:01 And motorlock is not that relevant
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:57:35 Like big means less small amount of detail is needed
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:57:56 That’s also sorta true
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:58:04 Never feel like building big though
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:58:13 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:58:32 The smaller the build the generally harder it is to get more score
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:58:37 Like if you actually try

general 2022-06-04 16:44:35 m24 flank tactics are great
general 2022-06-04 16:47:39 we have invis planes cuz of guns rockets that are inconsistent at best and just bad at worse, cutters that are blatantly op and fire works
general 2022-06-04 16:48:11 also the melt machine and the pusher but no one uses those
general 2022-06-04 16:48:45 make the guns all damage dealing then why do we have tracers that dont do damage
general 2022-06-04 16:50:11 id rather have slightly delayed guns then invisible planes
general 2022-06-04 16:50:27 just make a toggle oiption or something if possible
general 2022-06-04 16:51:02 maybe we can actually get missiles that work similar to 9bs

general 2022-06-04 16:56:53 so the reason pc2 takes forever is because he has to go through the mess that is the game without breaking old builds?

general 2022-06-04 16:58:23 (edited)

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:01:11 Somehow convince rickje to make roscale earth as map <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:01:55 Make deathstar shoot roscale earth <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:03:59 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:04:06 Assuming a four fold carrier
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:04:22 Each fold is about 37
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:04:42 Carrier is ~148 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:04:56 Gerald r ford as a reference
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:05:12 1092 ft
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:05:33 F18 is 56
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:06:32 Assuming the above is true
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:06:38 ~7.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:06:53 Actually no 7.6
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:07:08 Epic
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:08:44 You have 6 blocks from wingtip to wingtip
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:09:42 And 2 blocks from gear to top of vertical stab <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:10:40 Yo gotta do weird angle locking in order to get intakes
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:10:54 Cuz you main body is at most 1/2 a block
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:11:21 Wings are a majority of the width of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:11:36 And your plane from top to other top is 6 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:11:46 Tip *
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:11:55 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:12:04 Nowhere
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:12:24 Better start figuring it out lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:12:54 Also camera lock won’t work because as far as I know it’s locked to main seat right
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:13:08 Idk though
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:13:47 Intakes are irrelevant
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:13:50 Their under wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:14:03 You have 2.5 blocks per wing
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:14:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:18:39 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:19:07 Wow so original
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:19:12 But for it
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:20:07 F18 intakes but bigger 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:24:01 f18 vs plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:24:36 you do have space for a motorlock in the back maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:25:00 legacy might be harder cuz its smaller (i used legacy in the og comparison)
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:25:07 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:25:17 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:26:15 7.5 blocks long 6 blocks wide assuming an accurate gerald r ford carrier about 148 blocks long
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:27:30 you can do whatever
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:29:04 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:39:45 It’s roscale based on a 148 block Gerald r ford
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 23:40:03 Which was what the guy above was asking

plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:20:23 just hide the lock for it further back near your intakes
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:41:43 why
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:42:02 probably engines = more part= lag
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:42:19 but *less* lag

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:18:27 yes and also a bit further back
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:18:44 wings too far forward
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:19:26 for airliners theyre basically in the middle, but slightly forward

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:25:00 use the old square wing

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:31:37 assuming your making a high wing prop
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:31:45 what type of plane is it
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:31:56 jet or prop
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:33:00 small and high wing usually means twinprop
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:33:31 unless its the weird bae 146
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:33:55 ye
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:34:21 for props its better to have the leaning edge be perpendicular to the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:34:35 just use delta wings instead
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:35:00 thats fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:35:07 were (usually) here to help
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:35:27 unless its <#384025409945337856> where they just yell at you for no camera and motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 19:37:49 ah yes windows at regular intervals along the fuselage means its a glider

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:08:39 yessir
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:25:41 maybe because you dont have a tail section
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:25:44 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:26:01 slightly important
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:27:12 just do standard tail section
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:28:40 just pcc is sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:29:08 doesnt help that everything without motorlock and cameralock gets downvoted to oblivion

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:31:44 and the one reason is probably because it was so big minor mistakes didnt appear

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:34:32 i feel like whitenames sometimes only look at the roles you have to decide  to upvote or not
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:35:25 i feel like a low tailplane would be beetter

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 20:40:27 the stabilizers are too triangle shaped
