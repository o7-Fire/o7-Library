plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:42:59 since when did plane crazy start making haTS
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:43:50 i like how motorlocking probably got this game twice as many players
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:44:14 i have 58
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:44:19 mine was in 2016
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:44:46 crazy how plane crazy has been around longer than some people
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:45:33 i'm wondering whether or not i should get exploits to make showcases
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:45:35 using freecam
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:46:05 my friend krispy uses it
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:46:07 and
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:46:16 he's made pretty good showcases with them
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:46:30 also i've heard that some give you viruses on your pc
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:46:52 but you will see the shadow of the build
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:01 and it just makes it less high quality of a showcase
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:13 still
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:17 what if the drone glitches out
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:20 while recording
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:50 doesn't rickje doesn't mind the exploits tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:38 is it seriously that big of a deal
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:39 because
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:43 i'm not using it for bad intentions
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:14 good thing i don't have exploits tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:14 dang
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:36 so is it fine if i don't discuss it anymore
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:53 thx bro
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:50:36 to be completely honest who would exploit in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:50:39 there's no pointa
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:50:57 theres way better games to exploit in
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:51:22 oh god
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:51:40 i thought rickje fixed copy script a while ago
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:07 this is why i play in private servers more often
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:23 main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:00 themadvulpen uses freecam
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:04 and
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:11 that's an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:04 roshade is technically still injecting something into the roblox api
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:28 i forgor
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:29 about that
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:32 but yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:50 some shaders are exploits tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:53 like whizifys shaders
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:56:37 whizify's shaders requires an executor to run
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:56:53 yes but it requires an executor to run it
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:40 but freecam is an exploit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:55 crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:58:03 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:00:48 flightpoint has a freecam
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:00:56 built into the game
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:02:03 there are ways to make showcases
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:02:05 without exploits
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:02:32 i wish the glass was tinted
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:03:23 aint no way you can sell it for 500 robux
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:06:41 what a great day flying in a ripoff cessna citation
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:07:59 imagine if we had realistic shattering glass in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:09:04 motorlock makes no sense at all but it's still the best feature in the game
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:09:14 it can be toggled on and off tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:10:05 plane crazy builds are better than some studio builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:10:57 no shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:12:19 the ultimate showdown: which is better the bf-109 or the fw-190
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:14:25 first thing you see entering plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:16:04 guys i found a red button, i pressed it and i saw a bright orange flash outside, should i be worried?
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:17:16 is it bad that i know who that person is
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:19:28 remember when everyone used to think the 5th graders were cool
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:19:51 a 5th grader
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:23:41 rip
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:29:26 won't you fly highhhh yeah freeee birddd yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:29:48 me wearing the gigachad baby shark costume:
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 20:30:46 stuffing my body into a dead shark
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:13:54 ocean liners are underrated builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:14:26 what ocean liner should i build (please no titanic)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:15:07 why do i see so many plot trains in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:15:33 hmm nice i might build it
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:00 might build carpathia
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:04 carpathia is a nice ship
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:17:57 ocean liners are just underrated builds tbh
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:06 ship builder=chad
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:18:25 titanic with battleship cannon
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:19:11 trapdoors are better than disconnectors ðŸ¤“ (joke no hate pls)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:20:34 bro just make your plane have good lift and you can turn a brick into a cobra menuever plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:20:43 ah yes menuever
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:21:12 if you want good looks go for thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:22:27 should i make a flying titanic
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:23:13 i found a kid who said motorlock was bad because "it was a glitch not meant to be in the game"
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:22 NO...
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:24 NOO
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:31 I FOUND ANOTHER MADVULPEN F-14 REVAMP IN A PUBLIC
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:32 it's spreading
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:24:34 rapidly
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:25:35 if each block costed in game money how much do you think a hover thruster would cost
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:26:39 people went from adding ryanair liveries on their tutorial private jets to adding spirit liveries on their 737
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:27:54 boys, i think we have been successful in removing a ton of shredder bugs from plane crazy pvp
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:28:41 yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:29:10 to be fair i play in a private server most of the time
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:29:53 time for the ultimate question
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:29:54 who is better
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:30:00 nam or gjsolo
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:22 fucking byfron is ruining it
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:31:38 say no if you hate byfron!1111!1
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:32:23 imagine asking someone what device they play on and they say "yeah i play roblox on an xbox"
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:33:07 upgraded tutorial plane intensifies (i think i know too much)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:35:02 f-15 dog bird
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:35:20 bro tried slamming a darkstar engine in an f-15
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:35:58 (it worked)
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:36:12 but you must pay the price of 10,000 dollars each second you use it
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:36:55 personally i think private servers are more based than public servers
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:37:33 hyperbot hates everybody
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:04 remember when you first started plane crazy and struggled to make a jet able to fly
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:39:16 farewell
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:40:14 i just attached a forbidden firework to my F-16 fighter jet, who wants to set it off with me
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:42:30 what's the most underrated block in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:42:44 what about round wedge ins
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:45:28 i skydived in someones c-47 and broke my legs
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:45:30 should i sue?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:50:00 feed him boiling hot oil
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:50:11 give him boiling hot oil and disguise it as lemonade
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 12:57:01 i called someone out for lying about a tutorial and they left
