The Tale of existential crisis (451739682686894081)
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:04:07 NewDude_07, has authorized me to keep watch whatever happens in this server for him
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:04:32 I am, on the required age for the Discord TOS
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:04:36 I am not requesting it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:04:48 I am just stating my business here
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:06:29 Not at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:06:39 A plain friend, of sorts
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:07:03 I am sure of that.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:08:00 Xpert has removed him for being underage
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:08:16 He was very well until Xpert decided to remove him
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:08:33 Nothing, of course had happened when Xpert had done nothing.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:09:05 Yes, he requests to not touch on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:09:19 Although, that sounds very, very wrong.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:09:51 Not at all.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:10:28 I refuse to, I've only been authorized to keep tabs on this server.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:11:10 Well, from what he remembers, there were 2, but his gut is telling him there are 3 others.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:11:54 You think that, espionage, is the right username for my discord accounts?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:12:04 account*
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:12:33 Oh dear, I keep having account corrected to accounts
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:13:16 Well, nothing seems to be bothering that has happened after you deleted that and I didn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:13:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:13:27 He requested that
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 13:13:45 To myself to be named "espionage"
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:26:34 Good day fellow ROBLOXians.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:27:16 It's a bit mesmerizing, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:29:56 I agree with the moderator, I mean, it's disallowed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:30:15 Arguing in the server, I mean.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:54:38 Could I have my friend's builds to request for a rank?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 11:57:59 I think you could put a camera down on your UAV and that should do it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:26:25 The cockpit, dearly, with all due respect, it's horrible.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:27:17 I think so
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:27:21 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:27:43 No, more like just out of shape.
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:28:00 Agreed.

plane-crazy 2018-12-29 05:13:11 My friend wanted me to show you all this,
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 05:13:58 Good game
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 05:14:08 xD
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:45:42 My friend's got an issue, his creations keep glitching out when unfolded and it bugs him out with the motors when they are on infinite torque.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:46:03 Is that ever going to get fixed?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:46:11 I should put that in <#498473314445033472> ..
bug-reports 2018-12-29 14:46:22 My friend's got an issue, his creations keep glitching out when unfolded and it bugs him out with the motors when they are on infinite torque.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:46:42 There's literally only 1 setting, infinite torque...
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:47:15 One.
bug-reports 2018-12-29 14:47:58 Alright, thanks rickje.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:49:18 Well, rickje's working on a fix so you should disregard my statement now.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:50:45 Agh, the internet's bugging, just like my friend's internet.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 14:50:56 Well, rickje's working on a fix so you should disregard my statement now.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 23:17:06 Did I just see someone say jetpack in the test place? I'm going to tell NewDude this.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 23:32:13 Wow.
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:59:23 Damn, another update, New's gonna be happy
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 11:05:28 My friend is very well a uh, laughful, I guess? I don't know the words
creations-chat 2018-12-31 04:58:34 So I've finally tried out this game and it's actually nice, I've made a small plane which is basically the tutorial plane modified but it's my design, 17 blocks and requesting Beginner role. Dollar_Dollar1 is my username.
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:04:41 Thank you.
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:05:23 What about those divider roles? Where it shows which category of ranks my roles are?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:39:39 Fun, could I get this rank?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:40:20 Well, kind of a divider role more than a rank...
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 06:10:47 I can't suggest? I have a rank..
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:27:02 Hey, I have a rank now, but I can't still suggest, any help?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:27:29 Absolutely not...
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:27:36 Where do I get it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:28:32 Oh, but may I ask from you the role?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:28:53 and also may I have the builders divider role
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:29:42 I do, and it's the beginner role
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:30:04 I need this role, I want to get some color
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:30:21 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:30:44 Thanks awesome.
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:30:56 Oh, no name color...
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:31:04 I'll go to the colors channel then..
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:31:57 Blurple is kind of nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:33:46 Oh, wait, you're Figors, NewDude wants to ask something
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:33:58 Why did you get banned?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:34:30 I'm his friend
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 12:34:45 well, a friend of sorts
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:05:32 Basically, it''s just torque...
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:05:43 it's*
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:05:55 My first spelling mistake
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:06:22 I guess it's from how HARD AM I LAUGHING AT HOW STRIDEL SAID GERALD R. FORD
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 09:24:59 Doesn't seem scary for a mayhem tank...
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:14:33 How strong the blast is.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:15:40 Mhm
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:15:44 "pressure"
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 10:15:50 It's literally in the name
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 11:26:24 My friend, NewDude, wanted me to show this here,
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 11:27:01 He says his legal guardian had agreed to the terms
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 11:27:58 New specifically wanted me to post that in general chat
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 11:32:25 Now, may he join back, or no?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 12:26:10 9 is not enough for a suggestion to be accepted, no, there's no acceptable number for a suggestion to be accepted.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 12:26:27 
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 08:44:55 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 08:45:24 What idea is it, out of curiosity?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:37:44 It's spontaneous, not "spontaenios"
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:38:13 That needs to go to <#495286269459300364>.
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:38:56 Wow, the slowest slow mode I've ever experienced
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:39:31 Phew
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:50:01 That's not Dyno, that's kiwiman01, or did you mean that as a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:50:21 DMed with what?
creations-chat 2019-01-05 23:53:59 We don't need keybinds for the landing gear, we know how to keybind properly...
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 13:10:57 So, I can not leak links to NewDude anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 13:11:25 I have just read it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:27:22 NewDude uses alot of autoclicking in games, especially in games wherein PVP is fought with guns that are like the guns in Plane Crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:28:02 Oh, you.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:28:19 New wants to say hello and congratulations.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:31:39 Well, you.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:32:18 He's always had been angry on how people,
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:32:27 have not spelled his name properly
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:38:58 Uh, the same way tanks turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:39:20 One track moves the opposite way the other is going
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 11:39:27 other one*
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 12:44:18 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 12:44:29 I stated "out of the seat."
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 12:46:22 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 13:01:02 You would need a rank to suggest.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 13:12:10 Ones that you get from making creations, and the ranked role.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:53:07 What happened to the suggestions channel?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:53:48 For what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:54:02 Ok... Seems a tad weird.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:54:06 Why was it deleted?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 11:48:44 Hey you all, can I ask one question, the B747SP, is it possible if I extend the fuselage so it's a 747-8 while it having the same flight characteristics?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 11:51:01 Is it okay if I ping XpertNub336 myself?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 11:51:09 I'm about to do it.
