general 2020-09-10 04:49:31 I can’t open the trapdoors one my new builds with my mouse, is this happening to anyone else?
general 2020-09-10 04:50:08 How do I fix it?
general 2020-09-10 04:50:25 Yes
general 2020-09-10 04:50:45 It’s been happening all the time
general 2020-09-10 04:52:01 It’s still happening
general 2020-09-10 04:52:24 I replaced the trapdoors and they still won’t open
bug-reports 2020-09-10 04:55:02 I can’t open the trapdoors with my mouse on a recent build
bug-reports 2020-09-10 04:55:48 Ok
bug-reports 2020-09-10 04:57:02 Still not working
bug-reports 2020-09-10 04:58:41 No
bug-reports 2020-09-10 05:00:02 Ok, there are no anchor blocks
bug-reports 2020-09-10 05:01:43 Still not working
bug-reports 2020-09-10 17:41:06 The trapdoors on my newer builds are not able to be opened or closed with a mouse click. They are not locked and can only be opened with a key from the main pilot seat. My older builds that I saved before the save data update are able to be opened with my mouse.
bug-reports 2020-09-10 17:47:25 Yes
bug-reports 2020-09-11 01:35:27 Apparently when I open the doors to my builds, I can enter/exit them. But to other players they are always closed
bug-reports 2020-09-11 02:06:14 Is there a fix for it?
bug-reports 2020-09-11 02:06:25 And will it go away?
