[TITLE] - Better control surfaces
[CATEGORY] - Configurable

[DESCRIPTION] - (Sorry if I put this in the wrong category) 
For control surfaces, you should have the ability to change what they do. In there menu thing, there should be three boxes labeled Yaw, Pitch, and Roll. These settings should be on by default, but if you turn on off the control surface wont do anything for that axis. For example, the ailerons on airplanes control roll, the elevators control pitch, and the rudder controls yaw. The ability to do this would greatly improve gameplay.
bug-reports 2020-05-19 21:30:26 please fix motor 2, its driving me insane. when i spawn my thing theres a 50/50 chance of the motor just going down at full force instead of following the curser. when theres a max angle it will get stuck when trying to turn around because of the way it works, they shouldnt be trying to go past the max angle, and go the other way instead.
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:46:32 no, magnets dont work on other players creations. also, magnets dont connect, theyre pulled together, which can cause a lot of problems.
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:55:19 cant join the game
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:55:38 not sure if this is actually a bug but i though i should report it just incase
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:56:07 plane crazy loading screen :/
bug-reports 2020-06-06 15:53:33 It’s working again, you don’t have to worry. It was prob just something wrong on my end
bot-central 2020-06-08 16:13:50 [Continuation of my previous suggestion] I understand this may be difficult because the game is hard coded, so you could just add new blocks to work around it. Also, please put a little yellow thing on the SAS block so we know where to point it, and something else on it so we know if we put it upside down. I know this seems a bit far fetched, but you already have a similar system in place for mouse control with control surfaces, so at least give this a shot, and don't not try because it sounds hard. Thanks for reading this, and if rickje139 sees this, hi! I hope you all have a great day.

general 2020-10-20 18:38:15 oof
general 2020-10-22 17:07:19 toot i cant afford private servers dum dum
general 2020-10-22 17:07:29 also pvp sucks alone
general 2020-10-22 17:12:21 3mber just cause its 10 robux doesnt mean we can afford it, and  whats the point of pvp if your gonna be all alone in a private server?
general 2020-10-22 17:13:07 actually i just dont want to spend money on roblox
general 2020-10-22 17:13:23 ok?
general 2020-10-22 17:13:29 and some people dont want too
general 2020-10-22 17:13:50 id wrather put my money towards food and clothes
general 2020-10-22 17:16:39 did you read the suggestion i made?
general 2020-10-22 17:17:05 still better then not trying
general 2020-10-22 17:18:17 i know how to pvp 3mber but fighting against an army of shredders when youre trying to have a battle with someone else who actually makes good builds and puts in effort is extremely annoying
general 2020-10-22 17:22:38 3mber do you not understand that i want to be able to pvp in publics and enjoy the game
general 2020-10-22 17:22:46 vips are usually terrible
general 2020-10-22 17:22:58 boi
general 2020-10-22 17:23:40 ive gone through like 14 vips servers dedicated to pvp and the most people ive seen in one is 3 people including me
general 2020-10-22 17:24:14 and i dont want no one to attack me because that would be super boring
general 2020-10-22 17:25:54 3mber what im saying is if youre in a server with genuinely good people who actually care about the game and enjoy fair fights always get ruined by that one kid with shredders
general 2020-10-22 17:26:27 and i understand that pvp is ffa but there are some people who spawn kill and be extremely annoying
general 2020-10-22 17:27:42 im not a cry baby im just trying to make it a more enjoyable experiance
general 2020-10-22 17:28:24 and over 70 people agree with me
general 2020-10-22 17:28:33 just look at my older suggestion
general 2020-10-22 17:28:54 75 upvotes
general 2020-10-22 17:33:03 <@!730808827234091041> There are some people who enjoy FAIR and REALISTIC fights, unlike some people who are so bad at building that they resort to shredder swarms and ugly cubes with as many weapons as possible who think their good at the game.
general 2020-10-22 17:33:48 how many fucking time do i have to tell you that i cant afford a vip server
general 2020-10-22 17:34:20 and when did i insult you for "not having friends?"
general 2020-10-22 17:34:29 oh ok
general 2020-10-22 17:34:41 i thought that was for me lol
general 2020-10-22 17:36:00 oh and 3mber, pvp vip servers suck, theres never anyone on them
general 2020-10-22 17:38:55 thats true though ember shredders call me a hacker when my plane is faster
general 2020-10-22 17:40:26 lol
general 2020-10-22 17:40:48 btw yousuf i have a question
general 2020-10-22 17:41:26 I get this may be a bit rude to ask, but out of pure curiosity, why are suggestions barely read?
general 2020-10-22 17:42:41 i get that, but wouldnt it work better if the mods also looked at them, and if they felt one was actually good, they could forward it to rickje

Title: Cannon
Category: PVP
Description: Ships and tanks are limited to slow and ugly weapons that don't work. When you make a tank, you'd expect to have a proper gun that works well, but you are limited to things like rockets, which are terribly slow. An easy fix would be a cannon weapon. It would be the same size as a fireworks block, deal a heck ton of damage, and the shots would move very fast, although this would be pretty op. To make it less op so it doesn't completely ruin the game, it should have an extremely slow rate of fire (5-20 seconds in-between each shot) and have actual recoil so only larger and more stable builds can use them, for example, tanks, ships, and not lines with wheels with every pvp weapon strapped to one block on the front. This would make larger builds have an actual use, and make them fun to build and use in pvp. If you have any ideas about how this could be balanced more or a different way it could work, dm me, I'd like to hear about it. And there should also be a way to stager the shots if that make sense. (By holding down the button, instead of them all shooting at the same time then not firing again for a while, one should shoot, then a few seconds later, an other one will shoot, and so on)
bot-central 2020-11-02 17:47:42 heck

general 2020-11-02 18:19:27 capitalist i got a question
general 2020-11-02 18:20:32 if x represents a box with a shot gun, what would y be using the equation: x+(y/2x^2) = 281x
general 2020-11-02 18:22:08 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 18:48:19 it depends
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 18:48:25 how good are you at building
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 18:49:10 cause if you can build anything that requires an iq over 3 then im screwed

[Title] Remove Tracer Shots
[Category] PVP, Gameplay

Tracer shots (the red shots) from guns don't do anything useful. They make the game lag more, they don't deal damage, and only go half the distance of the other shots. It makes no sense why they exist and should be removed or given a use.

general 2021-06-17 21:07:55 outlines should be a toggleable thing for each individual save slot so some builds look better while some look worse, and there should be a toggleable option in settings for build mode so its either always on, always off, or follows the save slots option
