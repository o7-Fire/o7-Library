creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:13:19 Does anyone know how to make windshield lines on your planes or a tutorial to learn I want to build a c 130 it would look great
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:15:32 One question, how do you lower the trails using motorlock to make windshields? They make incredible creations with these systems, but they are complicated. Do you know any tutorials to learn how to do these things?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:17:56 thanks

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:07:34 hello
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:08:16 does anyone know how to transport things more safely in plane crazy I like rp etc and turboprop transport planes the problem is that if you transport something from another it falls
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:08:27 probably because of the physics
bot-central 2022-05-22 04:08:40 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:09:31 I really wish there were tools that allow you to connect and disconnect things
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:10:06 I just can't transport a container to the corner because when the plane leaves (when it belongs to another player) the physics break and it falls
general 2022-05-22 04:10:35 At what level can I send images?
general 2022-05-22 04:10:46 oh
general 2022-05-22 04:10:47 3
general 2022-05-22 04:11:00 I'm close to having a private server ðŸ˜‰
general 2022-05-22 04:11:26 but what do I need to do it? I don't remember anymore
bot-central 2022-05-22 04:11:33 !rank
bot-central 2022-05-22 04:11:51 sorry for the spam I'm looking at my rank
general 2022-05-22 04:11:59 yeah
general 2022-05-22 04:12:07 "free private server"
general 2022-05-22 04:13:12 so I have to create things that are mine and I send an image as evidence to be classified
general 2022-05-22 04:13:52 sounds interesting im not an expert builder but i built a northrop f 5 by myself and a humvee like vehicle based on the humvee
general 2022-05-22 04:14:24 and how long would it take after that to give the private server?
general 2022-05-22 04:14:59 it's like a humvee i mean based on it's separate i said first humvee it's like saying "well it's based on the humvee"...
general 2022-05-22 04:15:15 is that it is not the same
bot-central 2022-05-22 04:15:23 !rank
general 2022-05-22 04:15:41 I can't yet
general 2022-05-22 04:17:08 There is something I don't like and it is that the explosive block is difficult to create bombs. I have been trying for months, well, rarely, but I have been trying for months. There is a main problem and that is that the explosive block to touch the ground and you put a disconnector on it, for example, falls and does not explode
general 2022-05-22 04:17:10 tortuga?
general 2022-05-22 04:17:13 turtle?
general 2022-05-22 04:17:41 you said turtle in spanish
general 2022-05-22 04:17:57 I'm using a translator but I speak Spanish
general 2022-05-22 04:18:36 imagine scale tools and all that?
general 2022-05-22 04:20:17 hear a question by chance they don't know how to get rid of a shredder the other day no plane could leave or there was only one shredder he had control of the entire server

general 2022-05-22 04:22:12 Yesterday I was checking the creations channel and I noticed that they all have dislikes, in most of them there are well-made creations with dislikes that people like then?
general 2022-05-22 04:46:01 How long does it take to respond to your ticket?
general 2022-05-22 04:46:22 And what happens if I send only images, no video, I didn't know it was also a video
general 2022-05-22 04:47:13 although I have a vehicle like 180 between 250 blocks and it must have 400 for the range that I want terrain specialist
general 2022-05-22 04:48:21 oh ok
bot-central 2022-05-23 04:17:11 e
general 2022-05-30 03:05:25 mig 17
general 2022-05-30 03:06:28 they should create the mig 35 or 29
general 2022-05-30 03:06:50 I think my country is going to acquire the mig 35 in the future

plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:03:51 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:04:24 The failure of the f-20
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:04:42 My country could have it but it was very stupid and also rejected it
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:05:03 Only 5 of these left
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:05:25 They're going to defend us with 5 f 5
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:06:00 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:06:16 I don't know what the hell they think
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:06:32 If 10 is insufficient
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:06:53 LOL
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:07:17 Switzerland is smaller and has more of these and even F 18
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:09:04 Could these planes carry weapons?
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:10:19 By the way, does my f 5 look good?
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:11:26 LOL
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:11:42 I suffer a malfunction in my settings
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 03:12:03 My English is not very good
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:41:58 It's a T 33 I think Cuba used it in combat and sank 2 ships this is mexican
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:47:14 Although they only carried M2 cannons and had two hardpoints which I assume are the ones on the wings that carry the fuel tanks, although they did it with only their cannons... That's why I was wondering if they could carry more
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:56:45 Why don't you try using vector thrust?
general 2023-04-23 04:09:28 What do fighter planes use vertical rudder for? Because I think the F-22 can use it to turn
general 2023-04-23 04:10:14 I want to do something more real than use propellers
general 2023-04-23 04:14:17 Excuse my ignorance I remember seeing an F-22 move one up and the other down which results in a spin but I'm wrong
general 2023-04-23 04:15:06 that is vector thrust I think and I think it is with the nozzles
general 2023-04-23 04:15:31 Â¿No?
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 01:42:35 How about that prototype?
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 01:43:54 I don't know if to use those air intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 04:43:22 If it was only a prototype
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 04:44:01 I will publish it since it has been the main one for months and it will not be feasible to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-04-29 04:44:22 So I'll try to finish it
