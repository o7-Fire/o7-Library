general 2023-03-21 22:14:44 <@217336009455566848> I am here to formally complain that your game has another, (really?) bug. This bug includes when you spawn, you get jumped out your chair, and you have to get back in. As well as when you use anchor blocks you also get kicked out. This has ruined builds for players as some builds don't let them get back into their seats, and also makes building them more difficult if your a player like me who hides their motor lock inside of the canopy. I know you are working hard on plane crazy two and I am very generous for that, but this is a game breaking bug among many. I understand you will not see this message and like whatever.
