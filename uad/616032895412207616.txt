general 2022-05-07 01:11:39 Alright.
general 2022-05-08 19:26:49 No Furries.
general 2022-05-08 19:27:33 Is the game targeted towards furries?
general 2022-05-08 19:29:38 Well i would not try to forcefully include them, if there is a spot they can fit, then place them there, people hate it when you shove something in their face in the name of "inclusion", so i dont know.
