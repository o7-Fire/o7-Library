plane-crazy 2020-11-26 05:36:23 
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 05:36:28 Bismarck is finised
bug-reports 2020-11-26 18:46:17 Motors sometimes fling off my build and slowly come back to it. This includes whatever was attached to the motor. It's not an often issue but it is an issue none the less.
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:06:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:06:22 Make it like a flak gun
 They shoot out in all directions then stop
bug-reports 2020-11-26 19:25:17 Nah it's not motorlocked. Just servo toggle type 2 motors folding things.
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:15:37 Huge spitfire
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:16:01 Mine is way smaller but still good looking. Course not as detailed as yours
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:16:19 Ok so
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:16:53 I was using mobile to try and get some good screenies of my spitfire and I noticed not all the control buttons showed up on screen
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:17:14 The only buttons that showed up were the ones for the trap doors and the landing gears, nothing else
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:18:00 
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:18:15 Nothing except those 3. Edit : pinned messages say I need to include device type. Samsung J2 phone.
general 2020-11-29 02:47:15 How do we put in a suggestion? What's the command?
general 2020-11-29 02:47:48 Ello, I'm asking again.

bot-central 2020-11-29 17:32:18 .
bot-central 2020-11-29 17:32:30 I didnt ask for a loop!
bot-central 2020-11-29 17:32:37 =s
bot-central 2020-11-29 17:32:44 There we go
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:34:03 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:34:30 So tuesday?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:34:40 Cool
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:35:25 They should add an event exclusive material that breaks ice caps in the ocean
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:36:02 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:36:06 Weak minded
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:36:36 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:38:01 True that
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:38:11 No
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:38:16 Unless you know them irl
bot-central 2020-11-29 17:38:49 =s
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:39:55 Torpedoes are so op in pvp imo. The ocean rn is very small so theres not really alot of room to go if you're a big boat
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:40:23 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:40:44 I use a torpedoe design my friend uses and modified it a bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:41:01 Then made an entire torpedoe cruiser around them
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:42:07 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:42:11 Torps are fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:42:37 True
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:42:58 Oh is he now?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:43:00 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:43:12 Does he have a knife?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:43:51 Oh god
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:43:54 Motorlock torp
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:44:23 Actually what's the point of a motorlock torp if the firepower all  is in one spot?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:44:56 It's not like you're doing more damage cause its gonna blow up just as much if it wasnt motorlock and had the same body design
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:45:36 That's a swordfish
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:46:01 But theres not point to it-
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:46:28 Indeed
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:27 If the torpedoe was multiple torps that could unfuse and go in different directions
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:47:34 Then itd be useful
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:00 .
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:06 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 17:48:10 So a bomber

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 22:44:35 
bot-central 2020-12-17 22:45:33 =skip
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 22:49:01 It looks like a jet powered stuka
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 22:49:06 And it scares me
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 22:49:41 Evidently since vtol is a trend, so are the vtol jets.
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 22:49:49 So yeah I'd say so
bot-central 2020-12-18 03:20:48 =p ghost division
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:36:07 Player named Just_Samss who is a donator, is currently using a shredder bug and calling everyone who runs from him a noob
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:36:18 Can you see the flaw in logic there?
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:37:44 Petition to remove cutters as a block? Or at least take away their pvp capabilities so they're just double sided wedges?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 00:00:11 What's the code for the disc anywho
bug-reports 2020-12-19 20:52:30 Sparklers facing right of the plot's arrow. face left of the plots arrow when reloaded in. I have to manually replace them everytime.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:36:27 I hate and love pvp at the same time
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:37:06 I swear to God that new map better come soon so people can't just spawnkill ships in the water anymore
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:37:34 Ew
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:37:46 I hate those ones. They're worse then the normal ones
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:38:25 The only tactic I use against shredders is spawn killing them with my tnt shotgun
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:40:08 When I spawn at the airport my control surfaces that are mouse controlled invert
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:41:35 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:42:47 Also is rick ever gonna fix that sparkler bug? I'm using them as barrels for a predreadnought's guns but the bug is hindering me substantially.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:43:52 Boo
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:44:19 Kamikazies should be a last resort if your plane is damaged, not as a mainstay pvp tactic
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:45:28 Guns only suck if you dont stack them. Everyone knows that.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:46:03 Well excuse me a single gun doesnt do much damage now does it
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:46:41 Booo
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:47:37 As soon as this game gets moderation we need shredder bans
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:47:43 ...
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:47:50 XD
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:48:38 Nah they should. Theres no effort in shredders and they ruin pvp for people with actually good builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:49:40 I have. But I use builds with actual effort put into them
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 14:50:04 But please, continue to shun me for not using shredders, <@612861370660159508>

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:45:51 My fastest is 701 or so
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:46:14 My fastest ship is a solid 50
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:46:33 Damn, what class
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:47:26 <@683105477000822875> what class is that ship that goes 69?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:47:53 Didnt answer the question but ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:49:00 Metal wing panels make certain plane designs go faster.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:51:53 ... there is tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:52:14 For the save slots, yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:53:09 Ok well <@270017070635286530>  didnt specify what the undo button was for so that doesn't tell us much anyhow.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:55:35 Yeah that's a trash plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:55:52 Jet engines only give power in large quantities or in small craft
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:56:26 Show the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:56:33 Show us thow plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:57:15 That may be it
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:57:58 Wth is that
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:58:08 Like what the actual hell is that
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:58:31 Well, sorry I'm using my 1st amendment right
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:58:35 Live with it
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:58:49 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:59:37 Oh you really want to push me?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:59:38 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 16:59:52 Gimmie a minute to type a small paragraph
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:01:21 The first amendment of the U.S. constitution states that every man and woman has the right to speak their mind, the right to press, the right to PEACEFULLY assemble, and the freedom to practice whatever religion they choose.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:01:49 Oh did i?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:02:21 Jokes on you bud. I'm a patriot. I just pulled that from memory
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:03:23 I think your speed without those 2 extra thrusters is fine. As to why it goes up and down when fully throttled, idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:03:57 That tank looks fine
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:04:24 Maybe learn to build better and we wont
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:04:49 Improve. Upon. Mistakes. Scientific method
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:04:53 Oh can you?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:05:00 Then why build that sad thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:05:18 Eh
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:05:36 Thanks man. I'm trying my best
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:05:45 <:m_:778994206948589638>

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:07:35 If they can't handle constructive criticism then they dont need to be here
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:07:52 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:07:58 I dont think I will
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:08:32 Then close discord and ignore us you dont have to stay here.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:08:40 But you choose to stay
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:09:35 Because I have a god given right to speak. But you know what? I think I'm satisfied for today
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:10:02 <@456226577798135808> looks good to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:10:11 Wow that's a motor mess
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:10:51 .
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:10:55 What does that mean?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:11:50 If he doesn't want to hear it he can close disc like a normal person
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:14:59 I hate that inversion bug
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:15:12 It rarely happens at base, but can
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:16:20 Disgrace. Why would you reduce such a wonderful plane to a sea plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:17:13 Dark blue <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:17:59 I've never liked custom flaps. Too sensitive for my liking.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:19:08 Depends on what it is <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:19:34 Ah fine to me then
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:20:03 I hate the typhoon's intake design. It's like the f-16 but 2 intakes and I HATE IT
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:21:07 I dont mean I hate making the design. I mean I just hate the typhoon's intake design. Looks unnatural to me-
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:21:17 Exqueez me?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:22:28 What build?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:22:47 Oh you just talking in general

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:24:36 Not a bad stuka, <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:25:03 Idk nose seems a bit to short for an x wing but it's a decent overall design

creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:12:45 Indeed.
creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:15:00 It matters because they arent learning how to play the game, they're just copying what someone else does and not making their own stuff. If all you do is copy you dont actually understand how it works. Like if your friend copied your math homework they dont understand it, but you do. Thus why they copied you.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 19:16:53 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 19:16:59 Now what to make them turn
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 19:18:13 If you made those turn a working custom water prop, well... you'd earn my upmost respect.
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 22:49:52 Looks like obomber sent a drone or two down on americans again.

plane-crazy 2020-12-23 15:04:14 That it?

general 2020-12-24 14:16:47 Hello
general 2020-12-24 14:18:50 A few days ago a kid in pvp had themadvulpen a-10 tutorial. When I realized it was a tut I, a good person, called him out. He proceeded to deny it was a tut, then left.
general 2020-12-24 14:20:19 Who said I peed my pants?
general 2020-12-24 14:20:51 I called out his bs. If anything HE pissed himself. He left the server when I interrogated him
general 2020-12-24 14:21:05 Good man
general 2020-12-24 14:22:28 My stance on YouTubers who make tutorials is this. If they never showed everyone how to make their builds, they'd be well respected players imo.
general 2020-12-24 14:23:02 Oml
general 2020-12-24 14:24:23 He made the nouse's end flat XD
general 2020-12-24 14:25:55 God I hate the new b-29 bomber. It's the hottest tutorial on the market rn.
general 2020-12-24 14:27:03 I hate tutorial ships
general 2020-12-24 14:27:07 So damned much

general 2020-12-24 14:51:51 Why
general 2020-12-24 14:53:02 And that's the problem. Because these idiots in government think printing more money won't devalue the currency
general 2020-12-24 14:53:12 So they still print fucking more when they should stop
general 2020-12-24 14:54:14 I mean God you need a LITERAL TRASH BAG FULL of Venezuelan money to buy like a loaf of bread there

plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:45:50 So this kid comes in with a Bismarck or prinz eugen tutorial, and I immediately call him out
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:46:04 He says he modified it. I say I dont give a damn
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:47:09 He then proceeds to say that me and my friends who called out his shit are jealous. He then says since we know what the tutorial looks like. we MUST have watched the video and made it ourselves. Because theres no other way we can know it's a tutorial, right?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:47:52 Good
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:48:11 I give exceptions to heli. Because those are hard as shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:50:25 But this kid really tried to say since I know his ship was a tutorial, I must've watched the video on how to make it. Which is bs. I never made the tutorial, I only look at the thumbnail because that's all i need. He leaves on this note "ima just head out bc ppl are toxic and jealous XD. Yall must be so jealous." I dont think he knows what jealous means.

bot-central 2020-12-27 06:01:18 !help
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:08:09 Bigger ocean. I mean have you ever seen a naval fight in the game, it's sad. Since the plots are right by the water its basically impossible to have a naval battle in peace, and all you can really do to avoid your opponent is spin around them, theres nowhere to actually run
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:08:41 Yeah, we should have an icebreaker block
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:24 Also needs to be deeper. The poor submarine people cant go too far down
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:37 Indeed
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:48 Extend everything
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:58 Maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:10:31 There should be different biomes to take off at, one point for each biome
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:10:37 And each biome is huge
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:11:03 A desert biome, a forest biome, a tundra, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:11:40 Maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:12:17 The map should be more interactive either than the island proppellor going brrt on you
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:12:29 Like if you knock a tree, it falls
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:12:42 If you hit ice, it cracks
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:13:02 Yeah that'd be cool
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:27:18 Excuse me good sirs I thought you need only 130 upvotes to get hof. Why isnt the truck in there yet?

plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:35:25 Hey guys, how many studs per second = 1 mile per hour?
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:36:18 Oh no he's doing calculations
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:36:56 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:37:50 Yeah, that is gibberish
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:38:42 In game?
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:38:55 Ok so thatd be 16/3
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:40:17 Yeah that 16/3 didnt get me anywhere
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 15:41:41 Ok

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 16:10:55 ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 20:49:21 I dare someone to make the xp-77 (it's made outa wood)
creations-chat 2021-01-03 07:13:39 They can't handle the neutron style
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:20:52 Add some trees and a large ocean around it
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:20:57 Trees for ground combat
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:22:14 I swear if the game got an actually interactive map, like trees  falling when they get hit by a tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:22:20 Itd be epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:23:21 The trees respawn after 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:23:24 Is the idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:23:55 That's nice as well
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:24:42 Yes. Though if we want some actually good river combat, they'd need to be a generous width for river monitor ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:26:00 Also the terrain in the new map needs to be more organic. So the tanks can move on nice plains and swamps instead of hill valley we have now
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:26:47 You can have hilly areas every now and then, that's fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:26:54 The problem is ITS THE ENTIRE MAP
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:27:20 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:38:24 Bigger.
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:38:26 Ocean
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:38:37 We need. A bigger ocean
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:38:47 And rivers
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:39:23 But not small rivers. Big rivers. Big enough to fit some ironclad gun boats
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:39:33 For some good old 1860s showdowns
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:40:39 Add gun calibers for tanks and ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:42:25 We need larger and more biomes
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:42:44 Swamps, deserts, savannahs, forests-
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:42:47 Etc
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:55:21 Add large rivers
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:55:32 For gunboats and monitors

general 2021-01-03 19:26:32 Can we all appreciate the fact theres idiots in the u.s. government who think replacing the a-10 is a good idea?

general 2021-01-03 19:28:03 Laughs in harrier
general 2021-01-03 19:28:52 They want to replace it with planes that arent specialized for ground support. One idiot even thought the B1 lancer was a good idea for ground support
general 2021-01-03 19:29:28 How else are you gonna accurately aim a 30mm gun?
general 2021-01-03 19:30:01 F-16, f-15

plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:31:38 This kid is gonna unfriend me cause I despise tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:32:01 Wanna know exactly the conversation?
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:32:22 Ok, gimmie a minute for a few paragraphs
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:33:07 He joins me in pvp, and I see he's built and modified the poes x wing tutorial. I say nothing at first and am polite. Then I see another, unmodified one and start chasing it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:34:40 After a few minutes the unmodified one asks me if they wanna friend me and do a one v one. This was after he'd switched out his tut x wing for a bad custom one, then back to the tut
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:35:04 I say "oh wow, a poet's x wing tut.  So original"
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:35:47 My friend, who's currently recoloring his modified one, says "thunder theres no need to be mean to him, why do you hate tuts so much?"
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:36:02 I reply because they are lazy, and unoriginal
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:36:51 He says what if people cant learn to build on their own? I answer to do what I did. Try and try again
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:37:02 And he asks what if that doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:37:15 I say that then they need to try a different fields of vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:38:13 This other person, lolmander1, says that people shouldn't do tutorials, but if they do, they need to ween off them and slowly make their own stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:38:34 I'm still not being nice to the tut kid. So my friend says this is the end of our relationship, and leaves
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:39:01 Good man
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 04:39:48 Also he forgot to unfriend me

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:07:22 Learn
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:07:26 By yourself
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:07:29 From experience
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:07:34 From trial and error
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:07:41 Not from copying someone else
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:08:08 Look at pitcures. And build the pictures.
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:08:31 Not like that-
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:10:02 Ew
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:10:05 Shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:10:20 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:10:22 Good
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:10:37 Is it called tnt gun or counter shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:11:05 Ew
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:11:12 But good method
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:12:14 Do those disconnect into carpet bombs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:12:26 Good
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:13:29 Are you kidding me-
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:13:50 Wait why is that even a thing when the shredders can just spawn kill boats
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:13 Also stop using a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:20 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:24 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:28 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:30 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:32 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:33 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:14:48 No one cares
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:15:17 We
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:15:19 Dont
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:15:20 Care
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:15:36 I dont
general 2021-01-06 19:17:24 Hey guys
general 2021-01-06 19:17:39 Wanna see the saddest excuse for a battleship ive seen in creations?
general 2021-01-06 19:18:31 Saddest excuse for a battleship ive ever seen. Its not even a battleship its a poor carrier attempt
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 03:21:39 <@511559470376026135> thank you. The imperial starfighter core is proud to have you within our ranks. Killing that shredder was beautiful.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 03:39:07 <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2021-01-08 03:44:16 <@557933990447677441> mad respect for you buildin this, my dude.
creations-chat 2021-01-08 21:52:37 <@716084553713844275> mate you coulda used the iron cross instead
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 21:55:00 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 21:55:17 What was it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 02:25:07 Ok after somehow not understanding it for the better part of a week, ive just NOW realized how to properly calculate from mph to sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 02:25:23 If 1 sps is .6 mph, then 1 mph is 1.4 stps
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 02:25:43 Simply multiply the irl speed by 1.4 and you got it
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 16:38:52 Big map when
creations-chat 2021-01-09 16:43:05 I see no swases, only iron crosses. Wait nvm i see one
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 14:51:55 Then aim. Properly
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 14:53:34 You can slow down to match the rocket's speed, or you can aim adjusting your angle for the rocket's speed so theres less space for it to travel
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:04:18 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:04:26 Are you good with ships?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:04:53 Oi. <@527092191189925918>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:06:24 Good
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:06:32 Do you got a picture of it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:06:52 Roger
creations-chat 2021-01-10 17:07:09 Ah, hallo jedi. Also hotd
creations-chat 2021-01-10 17:09:10 No. That is the definition of being an og prequel fan.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:09:31 Attack boat with wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 17:09:39 Not too bad for a first attempt
help 2021-01-11 00:59:47 Angled upwards about 5 degrees or higher is good lift
help 2021-01-11 01:00:02 Anything above 45 is overkill imo
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 06:59:37 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 06:59:52 Should i post it and risk being downvoted to oblivion?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:00:09 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:00:47 Tww?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:00:57 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:01:10 Wait its the wild west why are there steam boats-
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:01:22 Gimmie a round
creations-chat 2021-01-11 07:08:48 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:09:50 Too late. (Old man shrugging meme)
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:32 Ww1 edition
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:36 Why?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:00 Well which variant are you familiar with?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:34 Thats the ww2 edition
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:12:03 Indeed
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:12:51 Yeah the bow is a bit short
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:01 But i aint bouta rip it off for a fold
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:17 Cut the barrels a block or 2
bot-central 2021-01-11 07:14:27 =p the yellow rose of texas
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:44 Cruiser?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:05 Too much aa to not be american
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:17 Can those turrets elevate, lockheed?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:22 Sad
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:35 Thats why i never rely too much on lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:43 Especially on ship turrets
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:22 I did, its just not really noticeable. I locked the turrets down to the level of the half block base
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:46 Sacrifices must be made for functionality
bot-central 2021-01-11 07:18:11 =repeat
bot-central 2021-01-11 07:18:28 =p come a little bit closer
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:37 Am i the only one who finds it extremely op that a battleship had torpedoes in ww1?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:20:21 True. *probably why they removed em shortly afterward*
creations-chat 2021-01-11 07:21:06 . Right as im listening to the song that played while he uses it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:22:34 Also can anyone explain to me why ww1 dreadnought style battleships have this like, flat area in the middle of the bow's curve before continuing?
creations-chat 2021-01-11 07:23:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:27 Secondaries
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:58 3d if possible. 2d if no other options
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:30 St louis
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:48 God that thing is op in wows
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:23 I assume 3 fold
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:27 Looks thin enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:39 Actually nah cause of the secondaries
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:57 I do oh so wonder what carnage would ensue if i posted a single picture of one of my css ironclads.
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:28:40 .
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:28:52 I just got a terrible, wonderful idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:06 Ship, obviously
creations-chat 2021-01-11 07:30:04 Also if you actually listen to the lyrics its about a woman intentionally making her boyfriend mad after she tells another man to dance with her
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:30:45 I still havent finished hms dreadnought
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:30:58 Ww1 hood or ww2 hood?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:31:22 I feel like ww1 ships dont get enough credit
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:31:44 How so
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:04 Spiral towers?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:16 The fuck is a spiral tower
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:40 Super battleships. But im guilty of makin em
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:58 Oh those are called cage masts
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:13 I just used ladders and did what i could
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:25 This is why we need ladder wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:14 Bow reminds me of a u boat, idk why
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:39 Ooooo
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:51 Will it have mini planes that come out?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:07 Yes, 3 float plane fighter bombers, idfk
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:41 Oh god
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:45 What if
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:36:51 What if when we get a bigger ocean. We get 4 people, who each own one of the japanese carriers from midway, and the 3 carriers from midway. And they recreate midway
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:37:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:38:03 Who would win. 1 big 18 inch boi, or *some tiny 5 inch 38 fletcher bois?*
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:38:48 Japan when it comes to making trailess torps : yes. Japan when it comes to sonar and radar : the fuck how do i make this
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:39:37 Does anyone here have ironclads?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:40:03 Who got out the damn dentist toolkit?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:41:01 I have a good css virginia/richmond. Idk which one it is because the 3d model i used simply called it 'ironclad'
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:41:14 Its guns are high up and cant elevate tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:42:03 How in the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:42:18 Did they make it look better with 1 paint and the default
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:42:39 Like my monitor was worse than this. And idk how you can fuck up the monitor
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:43:12 That looks like those ships made in steam workshop
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:43:29 Its good for what it is, but when i see it as a monitor... eh
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:44:09 I got rid of my monitor for the onondaga (its a monitor with a second turret)
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:44:28 Very epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:44:53 *But normal types cant hit ghost types-*
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:45:23 Very nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:45:39 Id say my best ironclad is my css Arkansas gunboat
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:46:03 Thats worse than mine
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:47:42 Is that. A 6 block nose?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:05 Above average
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:41 Because. Cool tech = cool overrated planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:51:09 Can we appreciate that someone, some incredibly odd person. looked at the unburnt bottom portion of the uss merrimack and went "ok you're gonna be an ironclad now"
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:52:20 With the power of [civil war era thinking and engineering] i made this sawed in half boat into an ironclad!
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:53:26 I see what you did there
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:53:41 Ausi war against emus
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:54:40 When you lose a battle to not even the full priced ostriches, but the discount ones : <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:55:06 Lol
creations-chat 2021-01-11 15:52:39 Great. No exposed rockets or propellers. I assume its purely motor powered. I'd assume it works based off the fact its still standing straight with one leg outward
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 15:57:34 My first ever bismarck (the shittiest looking thing ive ever built) used a conveyor engine. Needless to say, when i left the water it went a bit wild
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 15:57:48 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 15:58:01 They really forgot to hit the activate button
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:00:33 "I did a full of it" XD
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:01:01 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:01:37 What if someone made a tutorial just so when they saw someone make it they could shame em
general 2021-01-11 16:03:03 Unde
general 2021-01-11 16:03:31 The police only take 5
general 2021-01-11 16:04:37 He is immortal. HE IS THE MESSIAH
general 2021-01-11 16:05:46 That one minecraft youtuber with the jaw dropped skin. I hate him
general 2021-01-11 16:06:02 Dont we all
general 2021-01-11 16:07:13 Think thats what mods are for but ok-
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:08:01 You're probably wondering how i got here. Lets go back, to the beginning
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:08:38 Cutters need to lose pvp capabilities and become a double sided wedge. That is all
general 2021-01-11 16:09:23 No. You forget the part where they just jump all over your builds
general 2021-01-11 16:10:01 What
general 2021-01-11 16:10:50 Big good looking plane all the nubs will attack it
general 2021-01-11 16:11:13 Me, daddy
general 2021-01-11 16:11:43 Tell. Us what he did
general 2021-01-11 16:12:00 *W h a t*
general 2021-01-11 16:12:33 Clearly hes never been on pvp
general 2021-01-11 16:13:15 Scroll back
general 2021-01-11 16:13:24 Ew
general 2021-01-11 16:14:35 I only copied a friend's build once. And then it didnt work. V wings are most likely the hardest republic fighter.
general 2021-01-11 16:15:10 Republic y wing or rebel y wings?
general 2021-01-11 16:15:33 Republic has an actual hull. Rebel is a skeleton
general 2021-01-11 16:16:06 Ive made a rebel y wing work both with and without rockets
general 2021-01-11 16:17:25 Ties arent too hard. The standard vertical winged ties are hard with rockets. The bent winged ones are easy because they create lift
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:19:55 * caught* also in the stimulis bill congress made it a federal felony to pirate anything.
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:22:15 I dare anyone here to make an eclipse class dreadnought with the working deathstar gun.
general 2021-01-11 16:23:13 Small damage?
general 2021-01-11 16:23:38 Damn it reversing you broke the chain
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:23:47 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:24:13 Theres an attack heli that doesnt use a horizontal facing tail prop, it uses a back facing tail prop
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:24:17 Forgot the name tho
general 2021-01-11 16:25:21 Do you screenshot everything?
general 2021-01-11 16:25:38 Good
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:26:57 Upvote if you want cutters to lose  pvp capabilities.
general 2021-01-11 16:27:57 Who brags about playing adopt me that game is cringe
general 2021-01-11 16:28:15 XD
general 2021-01-11 16:28:44 Murder him. If he uses the enola gay tutorial, best take advantage and shoot him down
general 2021-01-11 16:29:24 Has he brought out the b29 yet?
general 2021-01-11 16:30:00 If he brings out the b29, destroy it with everything you have. It goes like 150
general 2021-01-11 16:30:41 The fuck-
general 2021-01-11 16:31:30 GUAYANDO😎 👊
general 2021-01-11 16:31:57 GUAYANDO😎 👊
general 2021-01-11 16:32:19 Tf.  Frickin emo kid
general 2021-01-11 16:34:06 Wonder how many people friended him because they thought the tuts were his own builds
general 2021-01-11 16:35:52 I only bypass using an actual bypass
general 2021-01-11 16:37:12 It allows you to say damn but not fuck. Pretty dumb if you ask me.

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 19:47:49 Im probably the only ship player that uses block layers as armour
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 02:59:31 We need naval guns in plane crazy. (With calibers from 2 inches to 18 inches) Change my mind
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:00:20 Naval. Naval guns. Shipe
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:01:13 To be fair. The Ac130 basically has a naval gun. The 105mm howitzer is the same caliber of some secondaries
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:01:55 Besides its not like the noobs will be able to spam the guns. The big guns will have slow reload
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:02:06 The bigger the caliber, the slower the reload
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:02:55 I said NAVAL guns for a reason
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:02:56 Naval
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:02:57 Boats
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:03:02 Not aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:03:38 I expect spammer cars to use the lower calibers because they need the fastest guns to spam
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:04:55 Singular ballast or beams? A singular is pretty heavy as is
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:05:08 Oh wait half
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:05:43 Half would be a good weight for the secondaries (2 inches to 8 inches)
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:06:00 The bigger cals though? Max density
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:06:33 Thatd actually be useful because i dont like to use ballast on my builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:07:17 You are quite the one word man aint yah
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:07:30 I rest my case
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:07:35 Cool
general 2021-01-12 03:09:37 Hey guys
general 2021-01-12 03:09:55 Just your hourly reminder shinji is still perm banned
general 2021-01-12 03:10:40 Also whats the command for suggestion again?
bot-central 2021-01-12 03:11:33 =help
bot-central 2021-01-12 03:11:47 =commands
bot-central 2021-01-12 03:11:52 Bruh
bot-central 2021-01-12 03:15:43 &suggest
[Pvp] [Naval] 
So, once again im suggesting naval guns. 2 types of calibers, long range and short range. Calibers 2 to 8 inches are short range, and have a faster reload time. Calibers 9 to 18 are long range and have a slow reload time. As the caliber goes up, the reload time gets slower. Calibers 15 to 18 inch will have a reload time of 37.5 seconds are to prevent spam. The block design for these weapons will be a cylinder. 18inch guns are the exact size of a cylinder, and it gets progressively smaller from there.
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:18:42 My suggestion didnt work even when i put the correct command in
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:18:46 Halp
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:19:25 It is &suggest
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:21:09 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:21:29 But hey. At least its perfectly balanced.
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:21:36 As all things should be.
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:22:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:22:37 Also can you see if i did anything wrong on my suggestion? Its in bot central still
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:23:03 Cool

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:18 Spam?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:39 Explain
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:39 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:03 I said the draw back for a large caliber is reload
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:31 Like pirate cannon? Or naval cannon?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:41 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:04:25 A cannon block is unnecessary. Ive made good looking cannons around rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:04:35 Too easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:04:50 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:05:22 No
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:05:58 Thats why you dont use guns on a battleship dipshit, you use rockets as the main batteries
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:06:16 You use guns for aa
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:07:02 Id assume hes working on winter update part 2, electric boogaloo
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:07:51 Id like to know when part 2 of the winter update  is coming
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:08:18 Define a ban wave
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:08:48 The hell is fps unlocker?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:09:11 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:09:24 Why would they ban ppl for usin it tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:10:19 I honest to god hope the second part of the winter update is a new map. Ik thats alot to ask, but i need that
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:11:20 Do you know how annoying it is, to have a naval battle. But you always get spawn killed by the shredders because the plots are right over the fuckin beach
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:11:35 We need a new map
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:12:09 The plots are right by the ocean is what i meant
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:13:11 Id like cutters to lose pvp capabilities altogether  and become double sided wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:13:49 Not even a dogfight anymore just a who can emp faster competition
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:14:32 True

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:20:59 Do you want the conversion of sps to mph or sps to kph cause i only know the conversion to mph. 1sps = .6 mph, so 1.4 sps equals 1mph. (Irl speed in mph) times 1.4
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:21:53 I just told you how to do it-
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:22:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:22:43 Wait thats not how it works
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:23:10 The conversion was from sps. To mph. Not mph to sps.
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:23:32 Wait now im confusing myself
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:23:33 Nvm

plane-crazy 2021-01-15 21:58:33 You got no damn clue what an inverted gull wing is do you
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 21:59:36 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 08:23:38 I think so yes. Drag is a huge factor as well. The fact drag is an option is what makes hover engines op in my opinion.

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:35 I hate that. So much. On my ship folds
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:45 And yes, i use motor 2 on ship folds

bot-central 2021-01-22 03:06:13 =skip
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:07:06 So
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:07:09 The servo thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:07:32 Ive done some test, and it appears, that it really depends on the way you built the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:07:55 The settings do have some affect, but it still varies from aircraft to aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:08:37 My yf-23s servos can only function properly on speed 1, torque 30. But my corsair's servos can function at up to speed 5 without breaking
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:08:43 So
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:08:58 Its really just dependent on the build
general 2021-01-22 03:09:59 Yes memes in general
help 2021-01-22 03:11:41 Ok guys
help 2021-01-22 03:11:54 So ive done some testing with various methods and aircraft
help 2021-01-22 03:12:15 And it appears the servo glitch is less dependent on speed and torque, and more dependent on the aircraft
help 2021-01-22 03:12:22 My yf-23s servos can only function properly on speed 1, torque 30. But my corsair's servos can function at up to speed 5 without breaking
help 2021-01-22 03:12:40 Eh
help 2021-01-22 03:13:06 I mean my aircraft still function right. Im not affected by this bug
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:12 Like i said
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:15 Its really odd
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:55 But ik for sure if you're covering the small gaps inbetween the custom panel and the wing with motorlocked panels, it WILL break
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:16:15 Luckily. I dont cover the gaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:14 Untoggled?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:28 Control surfaces have a toggle?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:41 Ok i thought thats what you meant
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:44 Thats what i do
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:18:13 But try hards cover those up, and when they cover them, the servo will break atm if the speed is above 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:18:56 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:18:59 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:19:48 I find it funny that this one guy ik, exfinity, he said since my plane can still work with slow servos, he called it poo
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:20:58 I see no need for vertical stabilizers. Besides the looks, they arent neccessary. My yf23 with its verticals bent horizontally can still fly like a normal jet. Just with a tiny drift
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:21:47 Do pre tell
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:22 I dont think you understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:33 I can fly my yf23. With all wings flat
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:40 And it still flys fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:14 The only side effect is a slight drift
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:36 Pog champ
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:24:14 He was using mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:24:20 I was using custom wasd panels
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:24:34 Go for it 👍
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:25:29 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:25:55 No
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:26:02 I like mouse for some things
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:26:04 But not all
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:26:29 I still use mouse on my star wars builds for elevation. A and d for turning
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:08 Define full glitched
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:11 What does that mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:37 So unfolding a ship on land
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:41 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:08 I sometimes spawn my ships on the base in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:16 Its fun to try and kill the spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:24 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:52 Ive found my corsair is rather... agile with wasd and bombs equipped
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:29:19 Sugar every single one of my builds are pvp capable to at least an average degree
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:08 Epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:47 Also wouldnt a cutter bomb be like a reverse flak bomb thing? Because instead of flak for aircraft, its for ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:58 Hes talking about clusters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:08 Bombs that split
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:36 You CAN
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:49 Just need an accurate aim and a big ass bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:32:38 Also i made the css virginia. Unfortunately for me, i did something dumb
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:33:59 Christ my ships from the side cant stand 1 torp without a huge 7 block hole. Those are 3 block thick sides. You bomb me from the top, im screwed
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:24 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:30 Like 1 tnt or 2 tnt blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:54 Is there armour in it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:03 Or just a shit load of aa?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:17 Is it all blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:19 No beams?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:46 Then make it fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:36:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:36:08 Like more water props
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:36:17 I just always shove more water props in
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:36:44 Has it sunk before?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:37:18 Damn
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:37:51 My ships can easily kill other ships with fast moving turrets and well aimed shots. Aircraft are just... they can easily kill me
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:38:20 Ngl that was epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:38:53 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:39:04 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:39:29 Depends
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:39:35 Wheres your seat
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:39:56 Is your seat in the bridge or hidden within the hull?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:40:10 Easy kill then
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:40:22 A few well placed broadsides
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:40:25 You go Night night
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:41:12 Motors dont matter. You can still control the ship. Hell one time i was going full speed, motor got shot and the ships back stayed on
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:41:44 The back was pushing the front, thus keeping it together
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:42:05 How many block layers thick?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:42:31 Does that count the deck or the armour underneath it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:42:44 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:42:57 Then my battleship has 1 more layer of deck armour than yours
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:43:07 I have a metal armoured deck under mine
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:43:27 Where
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:21 .thats a poor yamato attempt isnt it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:31 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:41 That thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:43 Looks weak
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:50 All my ships could take it on
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:53 And probably win
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:07 More pog
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:45 One broadside from any of my battleships
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:53 f
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:29 All my battleships have fast moving guns. And i dont rely on auto target so ive learned to actually aim
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:36 I could easily head shot that
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:57 Wont doubt you
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:48:24 Not even a motorshot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:48:32 Just shoot the bridge, its easier
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:49:01 No point in wasting time disabling guns when you can headshot and boom
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:49:55 Its broke rn. It depends on how the aircraft was made, but most are broke. Any servo above speed 1 will likely break

plane-crazy 2021-01-31 00:11:43 They need to fix physics lag. I swear my cruiser can do 46 sps (32 mph) and it looks like its doing 30 sps.

plane-crazy 2021-01-31 15:02:24 I think he meant build copy and paste
general 2021-01-31 15:04:58 Hey guys
general 2021-01-31 15:05:15 Wanna see something really disgusting from far away?
general 2021-01-31 15:05:39 Tick
general 2021-01-31 15:06:22 Tis a tick
general 2021-01-31 15:06:30 Ticks are arachnids
general 2021-01-31 15:06:53 Evidently not creapy
general 2021-01-31 15:07:21 Wow. So smart.
general 2021-01-31 15:08:01 Ok and
general 2021-01-31 15:08:38 It was a worthy cause. It was putting up a petition for zolure to get the hof he deserved.
general 2021-01-31 15:09:03 Cool
general 2021-01-31 15:11:06 Nein
general 2021-01-31 15:11:18 Join a public if you're lonely
general 2021-01-31 15:14:07 Wait shit i accidentally downloaded
general 2021-01-31 15:14:13 Damn it
general 2021-01-31 15:15:18 Why did you do creapy's homework exactly?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:01:21 The last p51 i tried to make started shaking at 310sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:01:38 Annoying as hell considering ive made planes of the same scale that only shake at 500
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:01:54 I guess i shouldve add some drag wingpanels
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:02:38 Wingpanels that only serve the purpose of adding more drag so you can go faster withou shaking to death
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:02:52 Ive only needed to do it once before
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:02:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:03:05 At the cost of speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:03:16 But you can add some speed with the drag intact
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:03:40 Epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:04:50 Its speed isnt the accurate conversion of sps to mph, but thats still a good speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:05:06 .
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:05:18 Ive heard 1 mph is 1.4 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:05:49 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:05:51 Ok then
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:06:01 Whatd be the conversion of sps to mph then
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:06:23 Im american, i use mph
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:06:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:07:01 Ok i think ill stick to my conversion rate.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:07:26 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:07:46 But that conversion rate is way too fast to aim a plane going the accurate speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:08:10 437 mph with that conversion rate would be like 1000sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:09:30 Ik but you said 200 sps would be 20mph. By that conversion, every 100 sps is 10mph
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:09:50 Lemmie do a calculation real quick
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:10:24 4000 sps would be equal to 400 mph based on that conversion rate
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 17:10:39 Which is way too fast to do any effective pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:30:24 I hate it
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:30:54 Its an f22 but designed with the dagger line of jets in mind
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:30:57 And i hate it
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:31:06 Yes.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:31:39 But thing about mutli role is its a  jack of all trades, master of none.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:32:03 Good
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:32:50 Unlike the f35. F35 is multi role, and thus can do everyone's job, just not as well
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:33:14 I thought f16 was a fighter
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:33:40 Please no. No more delta dagger jets, POR FAV OR!
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:34:05 Thats a10s brrrt in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:34:33 Why. Are those wings. Sloped down
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:34:35 WHYYYY
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:35:05 .
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:35:14 Stop with this madness of sloped wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:35:16 PLEAAAASSE
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:35:30 Worlds ugliest flying wing.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:36:12 I have a friend who made a plane with only 2 wings, no elevators. AND a vertical stabilizer, and called it a flying wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:36:13 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:36:41 The angle on those wings dont match with the nose. End my pain!
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:26 Much better
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:28 Thank you
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:38 Ew
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:42 Ew ew ew, china
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:48 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:53 But thats chinese made
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:37:58 So its disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:38:13 Taiwan. Yet.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:38:45 Their flying wing bomber is legit the b2 but with rounded end points instead of pointed wing ends.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:39:11 Damn commies cant make their own flying wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:39:35 Typhoon i would assume
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:00 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:18 Show me
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:32 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:42 I guarantee my first f16 looked better
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:40:49 And my first f16 was shit
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:41:25 Bruh china really copied the typhoon
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:41:28 Cmon man
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:41:57 Also if that is chinese, where is the commie star
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:42:11 All commie aircraft have a red star
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:42:32 How in the sam hill does that fly.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:42:40 China is commie
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:43:12 Tiny
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:43:58 Nah i see differences between this and the su47
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:44:22 47 reminds me of a swept wing blackbird. Dont know why
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:44:58 They already have global domination over the economy. Everyone buys from them
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:45:41 I hate that plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:45:42 Why
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:45:54 I hate the xb70
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:46:33 Oh god
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:46:45 I just remembered the flying pancake of ww2
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:46:48 What was its name?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:47:33 Not that one
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:47:40 The american one
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:47:58 No crap sherlocke they made the first jet fighter
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:48:13 No, the american naval fighter. It was yellow and dumb.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:48:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:48:48 Round, yellow, only made once.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:49:00 No
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:49:13 The wing was the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:49:23 With small vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:49:50 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:49:54 That cursed thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:50:08 It shouldve been burnt and destroyed at the sheer idea of it
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:50:49 XF5U Flapjack
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:51:43 102mm cannon?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:51:52 That thing looks small
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:51:59 Whats 102 mm in inches again?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:52:20 4 inch cannon
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:52:22 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:52:45 4 inch cannons are a joke to battleships
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:52:50 Even destroyers
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:53:17 Indeed
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:53:24 Because tanks are weak compared to ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:53:34 Railgun
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:53:40 Long live 1940s railgum
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:54:08 German scientists were the shit in the 1940s

plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:57:12 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:57:25 .
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:57:36 800mm on the water!?!?!?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:07 Waste of gunpowder
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:17 Or whatever germans used
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:58:45 The yamato is now shaking, along with every other fleet
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 18:59:23 But the real question is. Did the Gustav have american grade aa?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:00:04 Gustav was the one hit KO cheat code someone unlocked.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:01:43 Nothing short of a large rocket would propel it.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:02:30 What if germany nuked the allies first?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:02:42 Thatd be an interesting alternate history scenario
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:03:07 True
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:03:18 They wasted too much resources on the genocide
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:03:55 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:04:14 I cant silly mustache mans name
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:04:19 Ok. Adolf h. Then
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:05:15 No they have friends
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:05:26 But one is useless and the other is on the other side of the world
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:06:00 No italy went poof because its italy
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:06:51 Their navy designs were good as well. But they didnt have nearly enough oil to power their great ships.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:08:16 Adolf had to do all the heavy lifting. Italy couldnt pick up the 10 pounder, and Japan could do the lifting, but they chose the wrong weights (invested too heavily in battleships instead of carriers)
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:08:56 They destroyed our obsolete battleships
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:09:00 And thus we brought out the carriers
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:09:09 And promptly kicked their ass at midway
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:09:46 Oml
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:09:54 Why cant i say his last name
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:10:00 The bot is stupid
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:10:45 Seems counter productive
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:11:11 Erwin Rommel was a good man.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:11:22 Also this needs to move to general
general 2021-01-31 19:11:40 Ight bois the history buffs are incoming
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:12:19 Who doesnt like his silly mustache
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:12:46 No, we can say stalin because hes deemed fine by twitter
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:12:59 Even though he killed many more than A.H.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:13:27 But since A.H. only killed against a single religion, hes automatically worse than Stalin.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:13:35 Who killed at least 15m
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:01 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:07 And thus
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:10 We ignore him
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:18 And his autrocities in school
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:30 And only focus on mr. A.H. because muh jews
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:14:48 Thousands
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:15:02 And thats just the berlin wall
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:16:52 Anywho
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:17:03 Back to the genocide history talk
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:18:39 When you, the driver of the arch duke's car, realize that you're single handedly responsible for both world wars. And millions of deaths :
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:19:10 . They dont? WOOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:19:20 Arch duke of austria hungary
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:19:48 He got shot, died, and thus ww1 began
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:20:34 And ww1 started ww2
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:20:48 So yes, the cab driver is responsible for both world wars
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:21:25 Some other radical wouldve taken his place
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 19:21:46 Not maybe. Definently

creations-chat 2021-02-01 22:34:09 So you aint building the actual texas just using it as a starting point? If you are making the texas, add all the guns first, then the superstructure
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:19:37 Dude. Thats a pvp box. Its a shredder pvp box, seen dozens of em. That aint worth shit. Get it out of our sights.
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:23:42 Worthless garbage, its low effort, and no, 1 hour isnt alot of time, my standard ships take 3 or afternoons. From 4ish to 9pm a day. That thing you have posted is a killable shredder bug.
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:25:30 I  bet the hardest part for him was figuring out how to get 2 opposite facing motors to go the same directions
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:25:33 Its trash
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:26:36 <@514333972189151233> i would say add an emoji of a bunch of knobs for detail, but its a ww1 plane. Not much detail to them.
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:27:37 How so
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:27:43 Wait 5 seperate drives?!?
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 03:05:51 Stealth, rocket powered a10? Im nowhere near the skill to build this, but god it looks beautiful.
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 13:10:03 No, not all. Ships are much easier I'll admit, but there are good looking pvp jets.
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 13:13:30 Even if you cant make the jet look master class, you can still make it look decent. My a10 warthog was built with looks and pvp functionality in mind. It isnt the best, by far, but it still looks average.
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 01:03:06 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 01:03:21 Add a type 2 motor, with the base connected to the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 01:05:14 You used a servo to turn your tank head instead of mouse control?
bug-reports 2021-02-04 03:08:52 Mouse control is being worse than usual
bug-reports 2021-02-04 03:09:13 Its only on my 2 fold battleship for some reason, possibly to due with turret size.

bug-reports 2021-02-04 22:49:08 And you see kids, this is why we need ingame mods
creations-chat 2021-02-05 01:50:52 Nice. Dont see any need for improvement on that.
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 02:22:17 I have. Twice
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:45:49 Hey guys
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:45:57 Wanna see something gross?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:46:43 My cat's claw has evidently grown into a loop, and has now gone into her paw pad. Atm she is fine but here is scab that came out of the middle of the loop
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:47:42 I would give yall a grosser picture of the actual claw, but naturally the cat wont stay fucking still
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:48:29 Oh please it doesnt have puss and shit in it (yet)
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:48:42 Yeah she doesnt act like its there at all.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:49:19 But once it gets through the claw pad and into her skin, guaranteed she'll feel it.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:51:46 Finally, she gave in. Heres a shot of the claw (still not getting the full scale of it but better than a scab)
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:16 Yes
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:19 She acts like a dog
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:25 She sleeps and licks people
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:31 But she does go outside
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:53:22 Whats odd is the other toe on her other paw isnt big. Not even average sized. Its a midgit claw
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:55:32 Ok thats fucking good!
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:56:53 What?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:13 My cat didnt get the memo
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:19 I doubt it
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:49 Seriously though my cat didnt get the memo and now she has a looped claw digging into her
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:05 Wanna see it?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:11 NOOOOO
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:28 She doesnt feel it atm. Its only in her claw pad so far.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:37 Thats one hell of a trooper
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:51 True
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:59:15 The question is how to cut the claw off without this cat going berserk
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:00:21 All my cats scratch shit. I will always see them scratching stuff once a day. I think its because of her polydactly (having an extra claw/thumb) and thus this claw didnt get scratched
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:00:52 Eh
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:01:28 Thats Japan
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:03:15 Thats a fox thingy
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:03:39 Foxes are the best of both worlds (cats and dogs)

help 2021-02-05 03:14:03 Yes. We need an actual ocean so ships cant be spawnkilled
help 2021-02-05 03:14:33 That as well, deeper oceans
help 2021-02-05 03:14:52 But seriously though the fact the ocean is right by spawn doesnt help ships
help 2021-02-05 03:15:27 Oof
help 2021-02-05 03:15:55 Also we need sonar, radar, something. So we can look underwater
help 2021-02-05 03:16:12 Not just looking everywhere with 15 blocks of visibility underwater

plane-crazy 2021-02-05 03:19:13 Mad attack shouldve stayed

general 2021-02-05 03:20:10 No no, por fav or-
general 2021-02-05 03:20:27 Why
general 2021-02-05 03:20:34 What word
general 2021-02-05 03:21:14 Maybe this is why you need bi-lingual mods. So people can actually speak their native tongue.
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 03:21:26 Excellent question
general 2021-02-05 03:21:39 Google translate is unreliable

creations-chat 2021-02-05 21:57:48 <@711284968617410660> that. "Battleship". Is trash. I swear my poorly made uss Texas looks better than that, at least mine has the accurate amount of turrets.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 22:00:11 The hull technice is nice. But thats it. Thats the only good thing about it.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 22:03:42 No. That thing hardly looks like a ww2 New York class, i mean how do you misscount turrets?! The aa guns are painted bright neon green, the tripod mast top is square instead of pentagon shaped, the colors are too bright. I could go on. Are the guns even functional?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 22:06:04 No, your tank is fine. Its a beautiful ground vehicle.
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 22:10:56 Had a similar story happen once. A kid asked me if they could copy me. I promptly said exactly "hell no!" And then, out of the blue, instead of getting mad, they do something worse. They go full school counselor on me.
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 22:11:55 Idk phantom
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 22:11:59 Never tried it

plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:43:32 I met this player earlier today. First thing he says is "I am a pro." I say prove it. He proceeds to not load in any builds to back his claim, and then makes a large kidnap mechanism. Smh

plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:51:41 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:52:33 Why does the game give you a fake ship speed? It says my ship is pulling 47 sps, but if i leave my seat i get the real speed, which is like 12 sps
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:52:52 Is it rick's fault or roblox's fault?
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:53:04 Damn you roblox!

plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:56:54 We need the winter update to end already
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:57:18 This better not last as long as the summer update, that ended in what, October?
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:57:41 You can turn the fog off
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:57:48 But the way you turn it off annoys me
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:58:41 You cant just have a toggle button in settings, you have to go all the way to the lab and press the button. And then do that EVERY TIME you join a new server
creations-chat 2021-02-23 03:06:26 <@719112686612512819> Good sir. I love your ship. No complaints. I only ask, for more pictures. I require many more.
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 03:11:05 I was not expecting to see an ijn yamato.
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 03:11:14 But damn thats beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 03:11:46 Also someone else who armours their ships? I love it
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 03:14:20 I agree that something looks off about it
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 03:14:28 But i cant quite pin point it

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:47:48 Yf23's missile bay had a problem where if one missile jammed in the bay the others behind it couldnt.
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:49:05 Also does anyone know what rick did to the game? There's been massive delay spikes for like the past 2 weeks
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:49:53 Everytime someone loads in a massive build, the game delays and you cant place or save. Its not a pc issue, because my pc can handle big builds loading fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:50:06 Its only started recently though
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:50:20 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:50:21 It hasnt
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:50:53 My pc has easily handled 5k plus builds loading before with minimal delay. These past few weeks the delay can last up to a minute
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:51:23 And ik it isnt a me problem, several of my friends have noticed too
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:51:34 .
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:51:38 Its not
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:51:46 Its not for me
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:51:52 This shit started recently

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:53:10 Well then why the hell has it started recently for me and my friends?

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:54:33 Many alts
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:55:46 Maybe roblox just downgraded its china financed servers or something

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:38:34 Use motor 2 mouse. To make it work, keep the torque at 30 and choose an angle. Works fine on my red baron.
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:39:37 Amount of turns the motor can do
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:39:52 For some reason having the torque at 30 makes the motor 2 mouse work
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:41:10 No, it *shouldnt* effect how the motor 2 mouse operates at all. But it does for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:41:49 Just have the torque at 30, get a max angle of your liking, and there yah go
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:42:15 And if the panel moves the opposite direction of the mouse, put inverted on
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:42:52 Hm. Good question :)
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:43:48 Seriosuly though, idk because i used default mouse control surfaces for my red barons roll

general 2021-02-27 06:03:15 While rick is here. Rick, is there anyway to reduce speed lag (as in the problem where the larger the build, the slower it is due to lag)
general 2021-02-27 06:03:49 Lol
general 2021-02-27 06:04:15 I always armour my ships with at least 1 layer of armour behind the hull

plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:20:11 I wish there were icebergs ships could run into and be broke by, or trees for tanks to run over.
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:20:38 Also we need a larger ocean dang it
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:24:54 We just need a bigger and better map in general
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:25:32 The field is more hilly than it should be, the rails are just a short loop. The rail way should go around the entire map
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:25:52 We need a far larger and deeper ocean for naval engagements
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:26:42 And we need more interactable objects besides gas pumps that dont even explode when shot.
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:28:22 We cant have team build because its not possible
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 17:28:30 Smh

plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:22:48 Honestly just remove cutter's pvp capabilities and make them double sided wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:23:44 No mods mate
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:24:05 And there likely never will be because rick doesnt trust anyone, which is understandable.
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:24:52 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:34:21 Personally im fine with the german 1930s friendship windmill on builds if, and ONLY IF its historically accurate. Like if its on the bow of a bismarck or schanhorst, thats fine because its accurate, they had those symbols on them.
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 20:35:49 Nope

creations-chat 2021-02-27 21:37:03 Because it doesnt look like an f4u
creations-chat 2021-02-27 21:39:37 Firstly the wings arent bent upward like they should be, secondly the back gear is way too far up the tail, it should be under the vertical stabilizers, thirdly the cockpit is almost non existant.
creations-chat 2021-02-27 21:41:42 Eh my corsair is 2 propped as well, im too lazy to motorlock a 3rd
creations-chat 2021-02-27 21:43:50 We arent blind, we know, we can see that
creations-chat 2021-02-27 21:45:52 Cool (and yes i just wasted my 2 minutes for this)
general 2021-02-27 22:41:24 I love when people get offended over a friendship windmill on a german bb, because it was accurate and they did have the friendship windmill on said bb
general 2021-02-27 22:41:50 Thats history channel for you
general 2021-02-27 22:42:30 Mark Felton should be in charge of the history channel. We wouldn't be stuck with ancient aliens and fucking ice truckers.
general 2021-02-27 22:42:52 Idk
general 2021-02-27 22:42:59 I dont watch history channel
general 2021-02-27 22:43:13 Good
general 2021-02-27 22:44:30 I remember when CN reran the original teen titans instead of go for a bit
general 2021-02-27 22:44:33 It was amazing

general 2021-02-27 22:47:10 Robots in disguise was the worst sequel series ever made
general 2021-02-27 22:47:14 They ruined soundwave
general 2021-02-27 22:47:21 How the hell do you ruin soundwave
general 2021-02-27 22:49:44 We should widen the Panama canal
general 2021-02-27 22:49:51 So we can have larger carriers

general 2021-02-27 23:27:06 Not even racism. Just saying so and so is color. No specified color. Just the word color

the-dump 2021-02-28 00:32:40 *C A T*
general 2021-02-28 00:50:44 To recap :your vertical stabilizer was shot off, your wing is shot off, and your proppellors are bent like a bow.
general 2021-02-28 00:51:05 Haha
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 02:05:40 <@760543533064126544> dude your alien ship looks nice, but it looks like a mix of an x wing and a starfox r wing
creations-chat 2021-02-28 02:08:41 At least simple history gets *most* of its facts right. Infographics show is just shit. A prime example is their video about the bismarck, full of blatant mistakes. I think that video was ai made imo because no human could so badly fuck up the hunt for the bismarck. They call the super marine spitfire 'submarine spitfire'
creations-chat 2021-02-28 02:12:26 Dont forget the polish destroyer that harrassed the bismarck whilst flashing "i am a pole"
creations-chat 2021-02-28 02:15:08 Disgusting. If you want near 100% accurate history, I'd recommend the great Mark Felton, and for naval history, Drachinifel.
creations-chat 2021-02-28 02:17:09 Never heard of him. Whats his yt name. Also shall we take this to general?
general 2021-02-28 02:18:42 Well thats a first. Splitter bugs

general 2021-02-28 02:21:18 But we do have em
general 2021-02-28 02:21:25 Because they have no code of honor
general 2021-02-28 02:22:34 We need the pre-made proppellor blocks to be thinner. They look far too fat
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 02:24:55 <@643507783664402452> never thought id say this. But cool fnaf builds

plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:50:41 Because their builds are nice builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:51:39 Dont know
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:51:51 Also put the missiles under the wing, dont put them on the nose.
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:51:59 Never put missiles on the nose
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:53:07 <@456226577798135808> do yourself a favor and learn where weapons look nice and where they dont. Because the guns dont look nice, and never, EVER put missiles on the nose.
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:53:27 Its a fine plane, but the *weapon placement!*
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:54:48 Idc if it does, hide the guns better
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:55:22 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 20:55:29 Just, hide the actual pvp guns

plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:55:29 This 8 year old in pvp is trying to avoid criticism from his trash "battleship"hull thats a rectangle. He said the following "your talking disrepect to innovation inc member. Say that to the chairman. I say being part of a group doesnt matter to me, because it doesnt change his hull is low effort and trash. He says "groups are benifit giving. Group only stuff. YOU CANT GET UNLESD GROUP #######. I tell him that is unimportant to me. He says "say that to the roblox builders club. They will ban you. I respond by informing him im not in it. He says " SAY IT TO THE GROUP OWNER OF THE BUILDERS CLUB ##. ## IN ROBLOX, THEY WILL BAN YOU. I tell him i still dont care. He then tells me the thing that puts the nail on the coffin. He says, and i quote "im using. Diamond plats. "I say and? He says"plates, that is a metal". Mind you this is a pvp server. This kid thinks material gives you a pvp advantage.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:56:05 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:56:15 Just a rectangle
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:56:31 He isnt even using the full plot
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:57:07 His previous build he had loaded was a lazy pvp car, with all missiles pointed up. Not moveable.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:57:29 He thinks itll make it more bullet resistant or something to that nature.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:58:16 He also just said "most people hate thunder wolf. cause of his ########. ########. LITTL.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:58:31 I think he was trying to call my you-know-what small
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:59:10 Yes he does
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:59:51 He's a spoiled brat who most likely thinks being a grunt in a group means he'll get the owner to listen to every word or some shit
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 05:00:30 Yall can join me in public pvp and look for yourself if you want.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 05:00:32 Its trash
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 05:01:11 This all started, mind you. Because i carpet bombed his trash pvp car in a stuka.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 05:01:20 All of that. Because of 1 bomb run.

general 2021-03-13 18:24:30 How
general 2021-03-13 18:24:49 Cobi is as high quality as lego
general 2021-03-13 18:24:55 And they are made in poland
general 2021-03-13 18:25:05 Bruh
general 2021-03-13 18:26:02 Cobi. Is filling in a market lego doesn't particpate in. If Lego doesn't make war sets. Then its legal for cobi to
general 2021-03-13 18:26:38 At least cobi makes original sets unlike the chinese knockoffs who just make trashier versions of existing sets.
general 2021-03-13 18:27:18 Explain
general 2021-03-13 18:28:46 As long as you ignore the minifigures for cobi (which are pure nightmare fuel) they're good sets.
general 2021-03-13 18:29:05 From now

general 2021-03-13 18:32:06 Like a double sided stud
general 2021-03-13 18:32:12 Or a double sided 1 by 4

general 2021-03-13 18:33:09 Cobi brick quality is on par with lego
general 2021-03-13 18:34:40 Also I'd like to say that cobi hasn't made any british carriers yet.
general 2021-03-13 18:35:19 Long bois
general 2021-03-13 18:37:17 Also I'd like to point out that the cobi sets are (for the most part) not hollow. The submarine set is solid, and only costs 54 usd.

plane-crazy 2021-03-18 02:04:04 Me and a few others in pvp just bullied a kid named ethan08 off for his trash plane
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 02:04:23 To put it into full scope of how bad it was. He used super rockets to roll

general 2021-03-18 02:09:26 I'd like him to log this suggestion, and the 17 undes who upvoted it.

general 2021-03-18 02:11:03 Ew
general 2021-03-18 02:11:15 Why do the trash games always have the most players
general 2021-03-18 02:11:28 And the good ones only have a few thousand
general 2021-03-18 02:12:08 -gamepasses
general 2021-03-18 02:12:14 -many gamepasses
general 2021-03-18 02:13:13 Plane crazy is like minecraft but its smooth and you can drive your builds. Thats what makes it good
general 2021-03-18 02:14:10 Because they can't understand how to build an actually good plane.
general 2021-03-18 02:15:48 I mean how hard is it to pull up sketchfab or a schematic. My first planes werent the best but at least they looked half decent for a new player.
general 2021-03-18 02:16:31 Its a site with high quality 3d models
general 2021-03-18 02:16:40 Of just about everything
general 2021-03-18 02:16:57 Its a shrek meme, you get a pass.
general 2021-03-18 02:17:13 But its shrek
general 2021-03-18 02:18:04 I'd like to acknowledge the fact that this has been up for days now.
general 2021-03-18 02:18:37 Lets just set up a suggestion bot that removes any suggestion with the word whitelist
general 2021-03-18 02:19:11 . What
general 2021-03-18 02:19:13 When
general 2021-03-18 02:19:44 No
general 2021-03-18 02:19:56 I don't want whitelist, what i want is gunner seats
general 2021-03-18 02:20:15 Ie the ability for other people to control certain aspects of your plane in flight
general 2021-03-18 02:20:58 Except it involves coding some form of whitelist
general 2021-03-18 02:21:18 Whitelist is useless, yes.
general 2021-03-18 02:21:25 Gunner seats are not useless though
general 2021-03-18 02:21:37 You could crew a bomber while other people use the guns
general 2021-03-18 02:21:55 You could have a aa gunner for your battleship while you focus on the main batteries
general 2021-03-18 02:22:09 Gunner seats are a brilliant idea. Its just the coding that fucks it up
general 2021-03-18 02:22:41 Multi tasking only works for so long
general 2021-03-18 02:23:07 Touche, i do mostly use my destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 02:23:53 I- nvm
general 2021-03-18 02:24:14 No because its not a problem for me.
general 2021-03-18 02:25:09 I'd like for the new map to be an island. With a large, not very spawn killable, ocean.
general 2021-03-18 02:25:54 I-
general 2021-03-18 02:25:58 Actually thatd be cool
general 2021-03-18 02:26:09 I'd like that as well
general 2021-03-18 02:26:15 Maybe a cove or some rivers
general 2021-03-18 02:26:28 Rivers about 17 blocks wide should be good
general 2021-03-18 02:26:44 I-
general 2021-03-18 02:26:51 Ok i like where this is going

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 23:06:13 What atrocity is that. Why is the aft-most turret bigger than the others.
general 2021-03-20 23:07:42 You're dealing with world class shitposters on a discord, you aren't going to win.

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 23:26:27 That superstructure isnt even a superstructure. Its a sad, low detail tower with a small smokestack behind it.
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 23:26:52 There is no excuse for the empty space in front of the "superstructure" either
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 23:27:00 Hes just bad at looking at pictures

creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:32:21 <@754238494083252224> maybe add some curves in the fuselage with wedges and make it not a block? Also add some bombs and shrink the tail fins, besides that you're good.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:37:31 Debatable, im looking at a schematic and the tail fins on yours are pretty big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:40:11 Make them shorter by 2 blocks and then itll be scale ,because it appears on the schematic the tail fins end at the prop's center, hope that schematic helps.

plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:41:02 <@709209810310004837> while i like your suggestion, its a bit of a double edged sword. On one hand this would allow ships to have an actual interior, on the other hand this will prevent people such as myself from spamming water props inside the hull for an actually useful speed.
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 14:56:11 . If that is going to be a pvp ship like a destroyer or a bb, you need to work on the hull dude.

plane-crazy 2021-04-29 11:42:24 <@404539659440488468> i agree with the male no no part of the suggestion, and I agree 3/4s with your swas part of the suggestion. The only reason i don't fully agree on the swas part is because there are ships like bismarck and prinz eugen who had the swas on their bow, and thus its historically accurate to have it on them.
plane-crazy 2021-04-29 11:46:51 But then it aint accurate
plane-crazy 2021-04-29 11:47:06 I like accuracy on my ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-29 11:47:35 Eh

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:00:13 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:00:51 Unless its a motorlock spammer, this suggestion had pointed out a way to reduce spam, which is recoil based on block size
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:21:24 Propulsion...
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:21:28 Not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:22:03 Just floating island
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:22:17 But why do that when you can just make bombs
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:22:55 Maybe as an orbital cannon you could use an 18 inch gun turret.
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:23:18 How
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:23:28 Amx?

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:25:52 No, that base ruins everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:25:59 And you only get 20 sparklers
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:26:53 You know whatd be cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:27:16 If rick actually added naval guns, and someone made a yamato with said naval guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:27:33 Slow ass reload, recoil, and the damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:27:38 Oh the damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:28:14 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:28:26 Almost as if you can spawnkill ships or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:28:55 Slap a few german dreadnoughts together

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:29:43 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:29:59 I hate myself
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:30:28 Cause i want nice things but then i realize how there will always be people who just abuse said nice things
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:30:31 Like naval guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 03:31:22 I mean, imagine some kid just slaps 10 125mm guns onto a shredder. Barely any recoil, fast reload.

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:34:35 The upside is more detail and a better looking build

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:46:17 Easy
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:46:53 That person is a wuss
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:47:16 Ive devised a system to better saw off plane wings with guns
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:48:05 You have 3 gun stacks in the centerline of your plane. Place the guns in the nose or back its up to you. Just make them centered
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:48:36 Its really hard to describe how its beneficial
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:49:51 This design is mainly for killing slow bombers like vulpen tuts. The guns will continuously follow the plane so if you get off centered by a block or 2, at least 1 gun stack is gonna hit the spot you were aiming for previously
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:50:14 
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 23:50:26 True
