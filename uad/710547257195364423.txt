general 2021-07-24 19:36:12 roblox no physic
general 2021-07-26 18:34:51 so umm
general 2021-07-26 18:35:08 I just had an ingame discussion about the viability of mechs in the real world
general 2021-07-26 18:35:31 this dude was saying we could power a fast moving mech with a nuclear reactor tho
general 2021-07-26 18:35:40 entirely different
general 2021-07-26 18:35:49 Im talking about combat mechs
general 2021-07-26 18:36:06 that's a thing?
general 2021-07-26 18:36:20 ya but Fnaf world isnt even supposed to be real
general 2021-07-26 18:36:30 its not based in reality
general 2021-08-12 02:20:47 let me see
general 2021-08-19 20:58:38 question about this big update. Might it make some vehicles not work as well?
general 2021-08-19 20:59:43 will the aerodynamics and buoyancy be changed in the update?
general 2021-08-19 20:59:49 like, at all
general 2021-08-19 21:00:21 hey Rick, is there a CHANCE that a build might be lost in the update?
general 2021-08-19 21:00:34 HOLD UP
general 2021-08-19 21:00:43 INFINITE MAPS GONNA BE EPIC
general 2021-08-19 21:00:54 yes it is
general 2021-08-19 21:01:00 just look at space sailors
general 2021-08-19 21:01:19 to make bigger builds more feasable
general 2021-08-19 21:02:04 YO, how's the infinite map gonna work, will there be buildings at points and said buildings will just repeat? how's the rails and water gonna work?
general 2021-08-19 21:02:28 cool
general 2021-08-19 21:02:46 so like, the rails will be procedural generated
general 2021-08-19 21:03:02 they said it will
general 2021-08-19 21:03:32 I feel like there MIGHT be a chance that data is lost
general 2021-08-19 21:03:44 but overall I trust the devs
help 2021-08-28 02:12:46 so umm
help 2021-08-28 02:12:51 Im making a copter
help 2021-08-28 02:12:53 and
help 2021-08-28 02:13:13 despite being level on the left and right side, it leans to the left when it takes off
help 2021-08-28 02:13:36 right
help 2021-08-28 02:14:46 
help 2021-08-28 02:15:02 I can also provide a video of the issue if needed
help 2021-08-28 02:15:21 yes
help 2021-08-28 02:16:05 thanks
help 2021-08-28 02:31:29 Im now presented with a new issue
help 2021-08-28 02:32:19 Weight and Lift are balanced
help 2021-08-28 02:32:32 but when I fly, it frontflips
help 2021-08-28 02:40:52 nvm I managed to work it out
help 2021-08-28 15:41:54 so I'd like some tips on improving my copter
help 2021-08-28 15:42:00 it can fly, and decently at that
help 2021-08-28 15:42:09 but it constantly wobbles
general 2021-08-28 16:13:31 ya
general 2021-09-06 18:09:06 okay so I just had a stupidly good idea
general 2021-09-06 18:09:25 airborn semi truck and trailer that plays East Bound and Down
general 2021-09-06 19:19:18 can we just acknowledge how difficult Paint Blocks are to work with?
general 2021-09-06 19:19:28 aww...
general 2021-09-06 19:19:40 dude
general 2021-09-06 19:19:52 no matter how hard I try
general 2021-09-06 19:20:05 theres always lines of another color poking thru
general 2021-09-06 19:20:19 no
general 2021-09-06 19:20:26 i mean the paintblock
general 2021-09-06 19:20:28 like
general 2021-09-06 19:20:43 that's stupid
general 2021-09-06 19:22:34 its kinda obvious when the build is mostly black
general 2021-09-06 19:22:42 I use the paint can
general 2021-09-06 19:22:50 but then the lighter colors are funky
general 2021-09-06 19:23:03 it already is
general 2021-09-06 19:23:23 what if I dont wanna?
general 2021-09-06 19:23:34 aww...
general 2021-09-06 19:23:43 smonge bop popsicle lookin
general 2021-09-06 19:25:16 I have an idea that might work due to its sheer stupidity
general 2021-09-06 19:25:18 what if
general 2021-09-06 19:25:31 I set the blocks in a checkered pattern
general 2021-09-06 19:25:43 and use motor locks to set them in place
general 2021-09-07 04:06:43 okay I have a question about the revamp
general 2021-09-07 04:08:52 how is it redundant?
general 2021-09-07 04:09:21 no im friken serious
general 2021-09-07 04:09:31 how is hating furries redundant?
general 2021-09-07 04:09:54 . . .
general 2021-09-07 04:10:09 answer my friken question mate
general 2021-09-07 04:10:18 how is hating furries redundant?
general 2021-09-07 04:11:09 that makes very little sense imo
general 2021-09-07 04:11:25 the same thing could be said for hating alot of things
general 2021-09-07 04:11:59 look, I just hate furried because I personally see them as cringe
general 2021-09-07 04:12:17 I know
general 2021-09-07 04:12:24 but stereotypes exist for a reason
general 2021-09-07 04:13:01 yes, but it's hard to ignore them
general 2021-09-07 04:13:13 for every furry I see
general 2021-09-07 04:13:30 all I can think of is uwu licks ur leggy weggy
general 2021-09-07 04:14:00 oh god
general 2021-09-07 04:14:03 *runs*
general 2021-09-07 04:14:45 Ill have you know I talked to the cashier at McDonalds WITHOUT stuttering or being nervous
general 2021-09-07 04:14:50 so ha
general 2021-09-07 04:15:26 yo Lunar, mind if I take that FBI image
general 2021-09-07 04:15:34 I know a few servers that could really use it
general 2021-09-07 04:15:45 epic
general 2021-10-09 02:12:15 okay so I remember a while back people were talking about the new terrain generation system being worked on
general 2021-10-09 02:12:46 nevermind
general 2021-10-09 02:19:42 ya
general 2021-10-09 02:19:55 he looks like a dude at my school
general 2021-10-09 02:20:04 ya
general 2021-10-09 02:20:12 so guys
general 2021-10-09 02:20:30 Ya know the procedurally generated map thats being worked on?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 02:22:01 so is the Procedurally generated map gonna have things like paved roads? I remember someone saying the train track would be infinite so why not roads? It'd make things like my semi more fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:22:48 i just..
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:22:54 why do people use shredders
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:05 do they think they're skilled when they use them?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:29 but where's the fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:24:17 ye, I think a good way to fix it would be for blacklisted craft to not harm you
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:25:13 I actually go after them
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:25:24 also, I like calling them HMAVs
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:25:47 Highly Maneuverable Airborne Vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:26:10 I just think it sounds cooler than Shredder
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:26:30 okay one thing I hate more than shredders
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:26:43 those little troop squads
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:26:51 I hate those
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:27:15 because if someones using one
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:27:24 100% chance they gonna spawncamp you
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:27:35 okay so
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:27:46 how much better are fireworks compared to rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:28:08 that's JUST what I need
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:28:18 ya see I have this modded F-16 from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:28:25 and by modded
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:28:35 i mean it can turn crazy fast and IS crazy fast
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:28:50 but I cant use missiles effectivly due to the sheer speed of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:29:13 well THAT sucks
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:29:27 dont they have an ignore self like the explosives?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:29:39 darn
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:29:42 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:29:48 DO THEY WORK UNDERWATER
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:30:17 WHY DOESNT ANYTHING WORK UNDERWATER
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:31:02 I just want ONE projectile other than guns that works underwater
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:31:15 projectile
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:31:45 really?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:31:55 time for the ultimate ambush sub
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:32:08 yo Lee
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:32:16 that's lookin alot like the Apollo lander
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:32:38 shoot
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:33:35 💀
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:33:59 use ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:34:14 use more
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:34:25 **M O R E**
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:35:12 DO YOU NOT HEAR US
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:35:20 **M  O  R  E**
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:35:27 **USE MORE BALLAST**
help 2021-10-10 01:41:38 Nah, you just didnt use enough ballast blocks
help 2021-10-10 01:43:32 nah
help 2021-10-10 01:43:38 negative ballast
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:19:12 feedback since apparently everyone hates it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:20:31 <@!807336664627675226> Dude I legit custom built it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:21:28 WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH MY 1983 KENWORTH
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:21:56 well the original looked more like it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:22:17 until I found out that the wheels need a stupid amount of clearence
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:22:39 that forced me to add a block of length to the front hood
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:23:13 okay
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:23:21 I wanna see if the OG looks better
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:23:24 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:24:10 does this look more like a 1983 Kenworth?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:24:11 mind you I said MORE
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:24:32 hmm, yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:24:53 I've built planes most of my time on Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:25:07 and the helicopter from MASH
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:25:44 okay, Imma do this again
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:25:50 third rendition here we go
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:26:05 wish me luck with making this look at least presentable
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:27:31 Oh, I also forgot to metion
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 02:27:45 the 1983 Kenworth I built is a W900B
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:59:07 okay, Im working on a new one rn
but the huge fenders was a side effect of the wheels needing a stupid amount of clearance to not lockup
creations-chat 2021-10-14 03:12:11 3x3 wheels are too big and 2x2 wheels are too small
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:22:46 <@!839515883696816168> is that a joke?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:22:56 3x3 is too big
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:23:04 how would 5x5 work?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:24:05 well, tbf bipedal mechs are already not as common
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:24:36 cool
creations-chat 2021-10-14 03:42:52 Okay, here's the new one
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:00:50 as a rail enthusiast, I'd recommend using bogies. Most rail cars use multiple sets of wheels attached to the frame to get around tighter curves.
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:18:49 my mistake
I just got the names mixed up, my model IS a W900
Although it isnt a 1974
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:22:13 for the single stripe, blame plane crazy, I DO have another model with more accurate stripes and for the colors, I just suck at making custom ones. this is still a WIP though. it's just finished for now
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:22:34 <@!401530469952389130> lets continue this here because slowchat
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:23:17 okay so
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:23:45 this was actually the earlies rendition of the truck
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:24:31 I never thought of that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:24:51 also, how wide is that model and does it use motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:09 wow
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:14 and about the width
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:31 ya, that's the thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:38 I personally prefer 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:47 which my models are
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:25:53 which means
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:26:00 my cab is legit three blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:26:30 those walls on the cab are disconnectors and trapdoors
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:26:50 but Imma probably continue work on this tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:27:00 my biggest issue is propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:27:18 the first and third models use propellers
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:27:35 the second one tested the ingame wheels, which I found out SUCK
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:27:40 those things
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:27:45 need SO MUCH ROOM TO TURN
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:28:00 although, I might switch to 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:28:20 mainly because of that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:28:34 with 7 block width, you can make custom wheels
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:28:56 ive NEVER seen a 5 block with custom wheels
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:29:23 correction
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:29:40 ones that arent either really tall, or just chassis
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:29:54 wow, nice job
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:29:58 thats a good car
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:30:00 ya see
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:30:14 Im kinda moving from military vehicles to road vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:31:51 ye but back to the Kenworth
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:32:04 I just gave up on tryna do the trailer detail
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:32:32 the entire front end of the first one was legit motorlocked to hell
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:32:49 Id say I know my way around it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:33:00 cool
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:34:25 also Double
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:34:32 the third one I made
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:34:37 was legit made just today
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:35:15 HOLD ON
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:35:34 hold the heck did he do those headlights
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:35:58 how do those wheels turn?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:36:06 I just
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:36:27 ah, but do the wheel move back and forward?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:36:34 of course
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:36:54 man, seeing this made me realize how crap I am at this point
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:37:18 three years in and my best custom is a subpar Kenworth 1983
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:37:42 okay Double
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:37:48 now for the ultimate question
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:37:55 does it play East Bound and Down
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:38:08 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:38:19 also, just want to mention
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:38:35 I use 5 block scale because I feel like its more in scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:38:41 with people
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:38:55 your car there says otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:39:09 oh that'd be pain
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:39:13 but either way
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:39:19 its more in scale than 7 block
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:39:41 Ive actually heard someone say they build in 6 block scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:39:51 and I still dont understand them'
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:40:15 like I SOMEWHAT get how you could do that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:40:19 but why
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:41:34 Ive actually made a modded 1983 Kenworth for Pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:41:49 it looked like a bootleg mad max truck
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:42:14 I was just a dude blasting East Bound and Down as I rained missiles and bullets
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:42:22 and it WORKED
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:42:37 ya see, the upside of using only propellers for movement
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:42:44 you can fly with 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:43:00 that is smooth
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:43:34 this is my Pvp main, a heavily modded tutorial F-16
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:44:06 mainly modded for added maneuverability and more rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:44:19 oh, it also plays a eurobeat version of Kickstart my Heart
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:44:41 because it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:45:11 its a mix of using motors for more durastic turns and control surfaces for more fine tuned movement
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:45:23 its a vehicle of practicality, not looks
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:45:31 no actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:46:04 unless you count spamming bullets from a mile way, not hitting anything
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:46:10 and constantly missing rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:46:38 and couldnt any form of the gun item be classified as spam?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:47:15 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:47:21 this isnt a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:47:37 it can only move forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:06 I didnt say that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:19 why did everyone get on my case when I said it was a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:29 what's wrong with tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:42 I said I modded it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:49:25 it's my lame excuse until I build up enough skill to make a decent pvp craft
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:49:33 I tried before and lemme tell you
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:49:37 it was NOT pretty
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:49:51 yes it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:06 bruh its literally a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:19 oh so THATS fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:06 look, just get off my case
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:12 I have plenty of custom builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:27 I made it a year ago
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:37 maybe yor mom
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:59 I never said I was using it as an excuse for sucking
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:52:20 infact I said I was using it until I had accumulated enough skill to build a custom
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:52:36 i forgor
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:53:10 this is the equivalent of that meme where a kid asks if they have homework then gets covered in backpacks
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:53:40 you havent seen that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:54:03 mind if I DM it to you?

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:52:05 Im switching rooms in my house to a bigger one. That mixed with the fact that the trailer has a lot of detail, means it'll take a while
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:53:12 the doors dont work but it has a hatch on top
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:55:39 god I hope the infinite terrain update gives us some infinite paved roads

general 2021-12-26 21:06:27 my S&tB semi is 500 blocks
bot-central 2021-12-26 21:06:42 !rank
general 2021-12-26 21:08:39 does anyone know if I can use a single video to provide all needed info for rank requests?
general 2021-12-26 21:08:46 like, is that allowed?
general 2021-12-26 21:08:53 oh wait...video limit
general 2021-12-26 21:20:46 rank request has been made
general 2021-12-26 21:20:53 wish me luck guys
general 2021-12-26 21:21:27 geez if that were real I'd imagine a single gunshot would destroy at least a fourth of it
general 2021-12-26 21:21:45 due to the sheer amount of motor locks and clipping that would need
general 2021-12-26 21:21:50 thank you
general 2021-12-26 21:22:04 \:)
general 2021-12-26 21:22:23 as a person, sure
general 2021-12-26 21:22:34 \:)
general 2021-12-26 21:22:52 bro, theres no way that EXISTS in PC,
general 2021-12-26 21:25:33 GEEZ
general 2021-12-26 21:25:39 talk about a lag bomb
general 2021-12-26 21:25:59 its not dumb
general 2021-12-26 21:26:05 its called being gullible
general 2021-12-26 21:26:32 shut
general 2021-12-26 21:26:58 Imma go commit make a multi staged rocket
general 2021-12-26 21:27:00 cant be that hard

general 2021-12-26 21:29:49 anyways, has anyone ever made an 8 bladed copter?
general 2021-12-26 21:30:09 Ive seen 2s, 4s, and a few 3s but never an 8
general 2021-12-26 21:30:14 heck, even a 6
general 2021-12-26 21:30:40 because I may or may not be making a stupid one way sewer slide nuke
general 2021-12-26 21:30:56 and it may or may not be too heavy for a practical 4 blade
general 2021-12-26 21:31:12 plus. it just looks cool
general 2021-12-26 21:31:27 also
general 2021-12-26 21:31:37 does anyone actually have the heli tech rank?
general 2021-12-26 21:32:05 bc, Ive never seen a copter that can hover let alone fly with JUST propeller blades
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:34:12 to heck with it, imma get on PC and make a vtol
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:34:51 said vtol is gonna die
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:58:49 the worst part is
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:58:53 its a decent build
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:59:56 please dont say its...
general 2021-12-29 22:26:16 fun
general 2021-12-29 22:26:50 best part about the lack of image perms, its literally a skill issue
general 2021-12-29 22:27:25 I will admit, I have skill issue 😔
general 2021-12-29 22:27:35 Embed fail
general 2021-12-29 22:28:06 The first step of recovery is acknowledgement
general 2021-12-29 22:28:16 time to go build something cooler
general 2021-12-29 22:29:20 guys, question
general 2021-12-29 22:29:33 whats considered an expert rank?
general 2021-12-29 22:29:52 WHATS CONSIDERED AN EXPERT RANK
general 2021-12-29 22:30:23 WHAT IF I DONT HAVE EYES
general 2021-12-29 22:30:58 welp, time to make a Vtol
general 2021-12-29 22:32:19 this...is gonna take a while
general 2021-12-29 22:32:27 time to get VTOL Expert
general 2021-12-29 22:34:16 a **VERY** bad explanation would be, "reach all requirements, including the block requirement, and get a good score on it
general 2021-12-29 22:35:23 Men, wish me luck. For today marks the beginning of my quest to achieve the VTOL Expert role
help 2021-12-29 23:18:04 Hi, Im trying to make a VTOL and, despite the center of mass being equal distances from both sets of lift engines, the vehicle still tilts backwards when lifting, could someone help?
help 2021-12-29 23:20:43 its going vertical, slowly
help 2021-12-29 23:20:52 and this is happening the moment it begins to rise
help 2021-12-29 23:36:12 done, it works now, but requires A LOT of input to prevent it from losing control
help 2021-12-29 23:36:22 but, with the right training, it can be ran
general 2021-12-31 05:53:27 well guys
general 2021-12-31 05:53:34 I made a VTOL
general 2021-12-31 05:53:54 only issue is, I suck at controlling VTOLs
general 2021-12-31 05:54:24 hmm, no
general 2021-12-31 05:54:31 its unskippable
general 2021-12-31 05:54:51 *3
general 2022-01-22 02:39:58 does anyone else make their creations weird colors as they build to help tell the difference between blocks?
general 2022-01-22 02:43:50 yes, but
general 2022-01-22 02:43:54 *color*
general 2022-01-22 02:44:09 you could say the same for texture
general 2022-01-22 02:45:41 is it really?
general 2022-01-22 02:45:49 ye
general 2022-01-22 02:46:51 they're both good
general 2022-01-22 02:47:11 its really just personal preference
general 2022-01-22 02:48:01 TNT
general 2022-01-22 02:48:05 is your pfp
general 2022-01-22 02:48:06 legit

general 2022-01-22 02:51:29 aaand I have a problem
general 2022-01-22 02:51:39 I dunno what block I need to fill a weird gap
general 2022-01-22 02:51:59 nevermind, I found it
general 2022-01-22 02:52:03 ABOUT THAT
general 2022-01-22 02:52:07 fun story
general 2022-01-22 02:52:39 a dude in victorian England got his legs chooped off while working on the railway, he bought a monkey and trained it to switch tracks for him
general 2022-01-22 02:53:09 the railroad, being in Victorian England times, decided to let it slide and even gave the monkey a uniform and a salary
general 2022-01-22 02:53:27 yes actually
general 2022-01-22 02:53:32 really reliable
general 2022-01-22 02:55:32 i need to see this
general 2022-01-22 02:55:39 hang on
general 2022-01-22 02:55:47 gonna look up Dieselpunk, brb
general 2022-01-22 02:56:12 okay so
general 2022-01-22 02:56:33 basically, Dieselpunk is if early combustion was future
general 2022-01-22 02:56:49 like, ww2 era combustion engine
general 2022-01-22 02:56:54 but if it was future
general 2022-01-22 02:57:03 right?
general 2022-01-22 02:57:32 that's what I got from the first google results
general 2022-01-22 02:57:47 alot of it looked kinda like Wolfenstein tbh
general 2022-01-22 02:58:02 ye
general 2022-01-22 02:58:35 Steam and Dieselpunk kinda reflect the times that their real life inspiration came from/what they make you think of
general 2022-01-22 02:59:08 Steam is usually seen as more ornate and elegant while Diesel is seen as dirty and ugly, yet powerful
general 2022-01-22 02:59:20 go for it
general 2022-01-22 03:00:18 ye
general 2022-01-22 03:00:38 my favorite part of that story is the fact that the railway was fine with it
general 2022-01-22 03:04:54 nice
general 2022-01-22 03:06:18 and?
general 2022-01-22 03:06:58 not in Binary
general 2022-01-22 03:07:17 it is, just not in Binary
general 2022-01-22 03:07:46 we know this
general 2022-01-22 03:07:59 but Binary isnt math

general 2022-01-22 03:19:52 bro, someone just got into my plot while they were blacklisted
general 2022-01-22 03:20:04 they legit just somehow walked in
general 2022-01-22 03:20:16 odd
general 2022-01-22 03:23:53 yo, FireyOblivions tutorials are so good
general 2022-01-22 03:27:04 that is actually kinda funny
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:34:23 can I have some feedback on this Bell 74 Sioux
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:36:38 pretty cool

creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:47:06 I'd add some basic detail to the wheel sets along with increasing their size
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:49:12 you
increase wheel diameter and add some detailing to the outside
general 2022-01-28 00:57:12 guys, something weird just happened
general 2022-01-28 00:57:19 I got the beta tester badge
general 2022-01-28 00:57:54 but ive been playing since two years ago
general 2022-01-28 00:58:24 not complaining
general 2022-03-16 23:18:41 bro what
general 2022-03-16 23:18:43 no
general 2022-03-16 23:19:07 obviously you gotta use the poop for protein in your smoothies
general 2022-03-16 23:20:34 I've been in absolute sadness ever since I found out the music on by battle semi got copyright claimed
general 2022-03-16 23:21:03 honestly, worst thing Roblox has done yet
general 2022-03-16 23:21:32 I mean, they were gonna do worse, but at least those times they realized the community didnt want this
general 2022-03-16 23:21:45 this time, it doesnt even seem like they give a crap
general 2022-03-16 23:22:13 well, that's where you're wrong
general 2022-03-16 23:22:27 if they dont care for long enough, the devs will leave
general 2022-03-16 23:22:44 no updates to games = no braindead 9 year olds
general 2022-03-16 23:22:57 which leads to no bobux money
general 2022-03-16 23:23:39 ALL audio over 6 seconds long will be privated
general 2022-03-16 23:23:48 how's that not gonna affect them?
general 2022-03-16 23:25:03 but there's a limited amount of sounds you can upload
general 2022-03-16 23:25:18 also, I'd like to add
general 2022-03-16 23:25:39 you cant delete copyrighted songs from your inventory
general 2022-03-16 23:25:57 I have like 12 songs that got copyrighted and I cant delete them from my backpack
general 2022-03-16 23:26:50 heck if I know
general 2022-03-16 23:27:20 but I do know some of the songs I had are actually NC
general 2022-03-16 23:27:32 which makes it weirder that they've been copyrighted
general 2022-03-16 23:30:04 what of it?
general 2022-03-16 23:30:21 dang, he dead
general 2022-03-16 23:30:51 what's this about?
general 2022-03-16 23:31:10 THEN WHY POST IT?
general 2022-03-16 23:31:33 I thought you were showing us some kinda listing
general 2022-03-16 23:32:02 I was like, "dang, who's stupid enough to sell a 3090 for THAT low"
general 2022-03-16 23:32:20 IT WHAT?

general 2022-03-16 23:35:49 pov: your mom got privated by Roblox (she's over 6 seconds long)
general 2022-03-16 23:36:18 that is one well dressed man
general 2022-03-22 21:47:21 a nice surprise, people have already began to reupload their original music
general 2022-03-22 21:49:06 we should be able to somewhat recover from this
general 2022-03-22 21:49:19 fairly quickly I might add
general 2022-03-22 21:49:47 that was inevitable, they were copyrighted works uploaded illegally
general 2022-03-22 21:50:10 although, even Raining Tacos got taken out
general 2022-03-22 21:50:15 sad
general 2022-03-22 21:51:42 I know a lot of people don't agree with me, but I'm part on Roblox's side with this update
general 2022-03-22 21:51:53 the execution was crap tho
general 2022-03-22 21:52:19 or give us more time to prepare
general 2022-03-22 21:52:31 even that would've made this whole thing a LOT easier
general 2022-03-22 21:53:19 but ya, guess it's time to go thru my vehicles and change the audios on em
general 2022-03-22 21:53:57 that epic moment when Ghost Division got reuploaded so you can still use your Panzer
general 2022-03-22 21:55:31 daang, Roblox's audios SUCK
general 2022-03-22 21:55:47 the genre selector doesn't even work

general 2022-03-22 22:20:42 Jake, you're digging a hole
general 2022-06-14 01:50:20 how did I JUST realized Plane Crazy doesnt have a neon material
general 2022-06-14 01:50:27 hang on
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:51:37 how did I not notice until now that Plane Crazy doesn't have a neon texture...
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:53:15 man, sometimes Im mad that I dont have suggestion perms
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:54:02 Im out here, tryna make a car that can go into tornadoes, and I've hit a roadblock before even building the main body BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE A NEON TEXTURE
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:54:17 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:54:24 I am scared
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:54:40 the issue is
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:54:49 the lights need to be triangles
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:55:38 how am I gonna fit/position that into the size and angle of a half wedge down?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:55:56 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:56:04 my point is
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:56:17 it would be WAY easier on everyone if a neon material existed
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:56:43 is this man
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:56:55 so?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:57:07 how would a material cause more lag
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:57:29 just...make it not emit light?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:57:58 neon as it it's REALLY bright, just no light being emitted
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:58:04 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:58:16 the light block exists my dude
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:58:33 Im aware
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:58:41 my shower has been broken for the past two days

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:59:58 anyways, back to flipping between working and crying on a PC creation
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:06:15 isnt a conveyor engine basically abusing physics crap?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:06:33 ah, so it's like a kraken drive
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:06:44 fun
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:07:17 Im in extreme pain
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:07:44 Im 85% sure there's not a block that'll seamlessly fit here
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:07:53 dangit
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:08:20 
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:08:35 elaborate

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:12:05 oh, also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:12:10 did you draw your pfp?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:12:47 dang
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:12:53 that's a good answer
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:13:09 cuz the art looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:13:39 true
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:13:51 I would credit mine, but I cant find them for the life of me
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:14:19 just some random art of Gordon Freeman I found on reddit, can't find the artist for the life of me
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:14:32 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:15:02 whos idea was it to make a half triangle wedge, but not a half wedge triangle up?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:15:24 this build is going just like the rest of my building sessions
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:15:32 needing a bunch of blocks that dont exist

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:39:36 <@850927384789385238> check <#925563336500871268> to find out how you get a rank
general 2022-06-14 02:39:44 that IS a valid point
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:40:05 did it meet the requirements for the rank you applied for?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:40:07 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:40:17 how long ago did you do it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:40:38 from my experience, it takes more than a day
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:40:51 mods have other things to do than approve rank requests
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:41:12 just wait a bit, also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:41:19 what rank did ya apply for?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:41:37 ah, fun
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:41:45 I've been working on getting my terrain 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:42:15 idk, I havent checked the ranks in a while
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:42:21 imma actually check rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:43:05 okay, issue I see with getting expert terrain
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:43:17 it requires the community to, ya know, ACTUALLY LIKE YOUR BUILD
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:43:43 have you seen this community?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:44:05 if your build isnt god tier, it's getting downvoted to heck
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:44:30 huh...
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:45:42 fire, expert in what exactly?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:46:22 OH, expert designer
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:46:28 I was confused for a second there
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:46:37 I thought it was in aero or something
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:46:41 and I was like
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:46:55 there is no way that meets to block requirement
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:07 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:11 aeronautics
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:21 airplane, crap that flies
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:25 ye
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:32 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:42 exactly why Im not working for that
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:47:46 it's easy
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:48:22 I'm in the planning phase of a build for terrain 5
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:48:25 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:49:04 how so?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:49:36 legit only requirements are "it can move, turn, uses wheels, and over certain block count"
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:50:10 why do you think I went for terrain 1 in the first place, it's an easy role. I just got it for the sake of having a role
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:50:44 from experience, terrain specialist is one of the easiest ways to go
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:51:40 legit, I didnt even have to make anything with the requirements in mind. I just happened to have a semi truck that met the requirements
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:51:57 now, 3000 block, THAT is gonna be the hard part
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:52:20 might build something from Mortal Engines
