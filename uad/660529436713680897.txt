general 2022-04-02 16:17:01 oh yay its fixed for me
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 21:16:10 uh i have problem, idk why but when I spawn my m2m elevators just flap back and forth, its on the toggle setting where after i untoggle it'll follow my mouse, what should I do?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 21:32:51 no way
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 21:33:01 oh god ur right all my planes are gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 21:35:04 oh ok i checked the chat, gg for now
general 2023-03-15 22:04:56 do u use motor 2 for the controls
general 2023-03-15 22:05:46 so only control surfaces, if so then um
general 2023-03-15 22:06:10 try harder, idk thats the pain of building ig
general 2023-03-15 22:09:49 ok but does he know m2m broky
bug-reports 2023-03-15 22:24:37 yeah i can attest to this, like 4 hours ago i was fine after a new build, then 2 hours later all my plane were spazzing, idk what alternative we have rn tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:33:18 sign glitch what 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:39:03 bruh idk what the gltich even is
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:39:11 oh well imma go find it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:41:10 oh ok i see what sign glitch is, i experienced it without knows
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:41:16 looks like the case tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:43:36 yeap
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:43:43 happened to me starting a few hours ago today
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:44:00 my elevator is a flappy fish
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:44:08 we'll have to sit this one out ngl
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:44:29 ig build combustion engines using hover engines or sumthing
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:48:49 the glitch is honestly like the motor 2 lost all sense of torque
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:48:57 it dies at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:11 sometimes its affecting my planes that on ground too
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:26 lel
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:44 im assuming even wsad controls are gone too?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:51 if u run servo then wsad
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:50:05 n i c e
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:50:12 this is great
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:50:24 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:50:32 thats literally all avaition tho lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:50:56 the downfall of aviation in **plane**crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:23 too much weight will kill it if my torque theory is right
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:35 the irony
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:43 bugcrazy fr
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:52:26 another reason to not play planecrazy rn istg
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:52:43 i just built a new jet a few hours before this too
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:52:46 but oh well
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:13 fat gg to him ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:38 literally nam nam's thrust vectoring vid  💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:54 wat
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:56 ayyo
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:08 are u motor 2?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:11 cuz then u ded son
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:23 GG U ARE DED
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:36 motor 2 controls are shot rn
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:55:18 funny how the idea is solid with nice planes this is a fat L lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:55:44 wait does bro use control surfaces 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:10 al my jets are m2m
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:41 im gonna migrate to building car engines using hovers then for nwo
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:57 uh oh my boat is m2m rudder reeee
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:57:01 wrong reply

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:00:35 what is spinbreech wut
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:02:10 the big E of planecrazy is here
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:02:16 the era of m2m failure
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:11:22 istg
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:12:03 oh bruh so thats why my small planes are dying

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:42 good god
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:01 yeah the elevators

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:37 nah it was the rblx update
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:23:57 last time the game was updated was 12/29/2022
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:24:19 yes i am blind, it is waffled
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:24:26 AYYY
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:24:35 gjsolo planes be like
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:25:47 OH SHIT THATS WHY MY STEERING DIED
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:18 but nams tnt cannon isn't m2?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:26:32 yes

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:27:54 i mean they look nice ngl
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:28:09 opinion
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:10 how ya'll actually think is this objectively good 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:25 that subjective buddy
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:36 my point 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:29:58 he just made a video on how to do this lool
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:30:29 THATS NOT GOOD BRUH the ideal point is that custom control increase customizability
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:31:07 nah yall trippin
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:31:37 jeezuz christ i just fly jets with no weapons i just want nice controls
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:31:52 and it fucks up the ecosystem
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:32:10 thats debatable
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:32:56 the fundamental implementation of m2m was good, some bozo tryhards made it bad so this isn't really a win
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:10 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:34 ok then it depends on how bad someone's been harassed cuz i haven't been lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:51 like smol plane with m2m and spam weapons?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:07 it was equal before too tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:34 they aren't small?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:41 i mena like 4x4 block small
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:36:01 its a technique to build, but sadly many just copy
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:37:56 wth ppl do this 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:40:32 bet imma uhh idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:27 wait one clarif, the control scheme for that is glitched mouse right?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:48 then uh
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:56 oh so wasd controls
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:24 for finer adjustments
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:26 i asume
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:47 ok cool, tbh i ran that with motor 2 before i saw nams stuff
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:54 now just control panel ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:49:08 aight cool
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:49:31 uh this is fine with trapdoor wings aswell right? cuz dont normal wings increase drag
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:04 ok i see
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:25 aight cool
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:45 can u like uhh send me reference build, i live on trapdoors so ye
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:07 ye its fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:13 but
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:18 ah
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:20 fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:31 ok wtv i can figure this out it shouldn't be hard
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:52:16 nah thats fine im on break rn
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:52:32 but i do have a pending research paper sooo availability varies
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:10:12 ayy but my tank turret turns fine quickly
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:10:32 uh yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:10:41 hm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:11:09 but like my small spammer build has a small turret and thats fine aswell?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:11:50 me wh only made mini planes cuz they were fun 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:12:01 wait wait check something
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:12:13 put the m2 in the back end and see what it does
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:13:49 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:13:57 time to test some m2m to see something
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:21 somehow this seems like an unpopular opinion atm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:24 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:30 basically
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:16:23 classic m2m failure rn
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:21 u just realized
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:58 no its not
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:20:12 its only fine for u buddy
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:20:24 this is fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:21:25 wait deadass
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:21:31 the performance part
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:53:25 nam nam thurst vectoring i see
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:11 send pic of build thats fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:16 RIGH NEOW
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:59 yes that is the case
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:06 ur motor 2 is very dead
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:11 its land thats why
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:14 and big
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:26 wasd controls?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:19:22 me also comma
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:19:47 any control surface that uses m2 is dead
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:13 so low torque control surfaces work?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:23 plz do
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:27 bet
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:50 ye but thats big build, chat figured out big alierons and builds aren't affected
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:58 dam
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:21:15 reeeee
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:21:24 welp where is mr ricky
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:21:40 jk just make control surface binds and motorlock them for now
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:21:58 we'll see what happens in about 10 years from now

plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:10 hehe....
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:28 imma stick to random builds atm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:49 hes not wrong
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:00 its mouse motor 2 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:05 it follows ur mouse
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:14 thats why u do toggle and some rando bind
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:31 n i c e
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:54 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:25:04 not really
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:25:15 basic m2 is broken for planes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:25:38 weirdly the smaller the control surfaces I have the bigger the issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:25:59 like only one motor2 with like 2 wingpanels or sumthing
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:26:09 i think???
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:26:24 but then when I made a big build, at high speeds the elevator went flat
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:26:27 no response
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:26:49 nah the game was fine, the upkeep with rblx updates wasnt
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:27:17 i Like how the Trenches dev haruna is alone as well
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:27:44 but thats a pretty small game in comparison
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:27:57 this ^
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:28:01 where the bills at
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:40:03 ah yes this is a bigger plane crazy like rabbit hole
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:42:33 planecrazy big builders on their way to learn the art of folding (origami)
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:44:09 l o l
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:45:02 wait what is that
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:45:06 idk name
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:45:10 probs saw it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:46:17 good god what
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:46:28 ah yes this
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:47:00 watch him say m2m
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:47:15 sucks to suck ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:48:08 yah true
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:48:32 ngl i might just make my builds gjsolo, altho i despise glitch mouse even if its irl accurate
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:48:49 just personal preference there tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:49:19 um uh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:49:23 dood person
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:49:26 on the yootoob
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:49:33 other pvp sweat
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:49:56 and some ppl play press f to fire
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:50:02 very nice ppl they are
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:51:03 F because why not
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:51:30 would bind to my 3rd or 4th mouse button but game dont see that input
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:51:42 ah yes a non gun user
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:51:49 indeed a great choice
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:51:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:52:29 yeah gun kinda poo poo
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:52:42 too much lag
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:05 bruh my red tracers barely appear at times
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:19 fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:30 i just use 2 fireworks with diff distance tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:38 then bind to lmb and boom
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:45 oh nah
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:49 not enough range bruh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:53:59 unless they come to bomb me then its p ez
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:54:11 nah
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:54:18 indeed
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:54:32 also the correct use of the term velocity
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:54:56 since uhh its a vector value direction and speed are both considered
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:55:17 indeed
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:56:02 basically
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:56:40 and hopefully if I wait long enough m2m will be fixed but who knows so imma just build a ctrl surface plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:56:53 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:57:18 oh well gotta finish a physics paper so imma dip until whenever i finish
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:57:22 uhhh it broky
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:57:29 check chat history and u'll know
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:57:33 or bug reports
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:03:00 💀 this kid
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:22:58 just so like that right?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:28:01 the only time that tilt is validly a rblx thing is for helis with yaw tilt tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:28:23 but thats an irl thing too soo
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:31:20 
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:31:21 thingy
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:38:06 nha deadass it looks like the update conflict is worse than expected
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:38:15 like its not a simple ass fix
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:38:19 kidna big sad
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:38:27 ?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:48:43 he has experienced the fall of the m2
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:48:56 the suffering this has caused
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:49:03 indeed the big sad
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:54:04 Godfather moment
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:54:48 y e s
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:55:00 t h a t  i s  t h e  i s s u e
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:55:10 the whole motor 2 is messed up
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:07 he used control surfaces bruh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:35 at this point there are 2 factions, those who got hurt from this and those who could care less cuz they don't use m2m
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:46 wither motor 2?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:53 my point
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:57:04 there are still those who dont
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:57:23 just say it what is it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:57:48 ah well they think otherwise so don't argue with since all they say is basically:<:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:00 amazing
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:02 who cares
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:15 great leave him then
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:43 so wait how does ur build not be affected by the m2m issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:59:09 noice
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:59:38 uh um i would advise u don't use this line of reasoning as there are veterens who dont use m2m
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:00:01 control panels and glitch mouse
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:00:08 motorlock the panel
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:00:15 the whole wing is a set of waffle panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:02:25 btw does m2 gm work or thats gone too?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:02:40 motor 2 glitch mouse
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:02:57 did anyone check
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:21 so it doesn't utilize motor2?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:32 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:38 test it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:04:15 oh bruh ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:04:23 fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:05:32 white names?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:05:43 oh i see
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:06:06 cuz i only came here to ask abt it since i was already in the server
general 2023-03-16 03:08:09 that heart workin
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:09:10 OKOK
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:09:18 so i dont have to do anything
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:09:19 nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:09:30 well hopefully
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:12:50 no bruh 🤦‍♂️ the glitch mouse control scheme, works for control surfaces and m2
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:13:05 its motor 2 mouse which is broke as hell rn
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:13:31 afaik there are 3 main schemes, wasd, m2m and glitch mouse
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:13:54 go find a veedio
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:14:00 it'll make more sense
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:15:00 🐒
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:15:08 monkee
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:16:33 yaaaay
general 2023-03-16 04:23:44 this is art
general 2023-03-16 16:54:34 Green parakeet plane
general 2023-03-16 16:54:49 Noice
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:06:36 WAIT REALLY
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:06:51 oh wait no right
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:07:14 like with hindrances or full work
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:07:19 like before
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:07:30 ok imma check
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:07:47 but this funni has got me interested in trying control panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:07:56 they do seem more minimal in terms of jet design
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:10:08 oh ur right
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:10:10 yaay
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:10:32 idk probs in like 3023 tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:10:46 m2?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:11:04 are u happy mad or both?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:11:27 oh lel
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:11:35 bugs are bugs
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:11:51 we need the equivalent of a Raid Cockroach spray that everyone can pre build
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:12:05 or easily keep in one slot
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:12:22 but that might just become bugs 2.0 if they're better than the bugs soo
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:13:10 yeah true
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:13:27 honestly for the big balls scatter bombing them works buts thats too much effort
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:14:04 ah le wobble
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:14:36 since my pea brain can't comprehend big build motorlock my mini planes can fly or fall depending on 1 or 2 wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:14:42 but thats a skill issue on my part tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:15:21 yeah so basically lift tuning and what not
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:15:29 🐒
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:15:55 monkee
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:16:04 who knows man i have like 3 active braincells rn
