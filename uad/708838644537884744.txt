plane-crazy 2020-09-01 18:29:06 hi, I have a question
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 18:29:39 is the jet engine propeller color saved?
bug-reports 2020-09-01 19:30:58 this is a weird thing with the smoke pipes and probably with snow pipes too...
bug-reports 2020-09-01 19:33:55 nothing to fix it?
bug-reports 2020-09-01 19:34:10 ok
bug-reports 2020-09-22 18:57:23 blue suspension string is missing on some of the suspensions. it does the same when a load.
bug-reports 2020-10-25 13:24:38 sound not loaded (but not game fault)
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 23:59:19 does someone have a tip to make a throttle motor?
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 23:59:37 with a max angle but not a servo mode
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:01:02 i tried putting a block to stop the motor at the angle but when there are two motors they don't stay aligned
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:05:43 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:05:54 good idea
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:06:04 should I use cameras?
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:06:11 to make it invisible
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:06:54 ok
help 2020-12-13 17:31:08 what does rope restitution do?
bug-reports 2021-01-30 20:25:05 my character's legs go through the black floor and I slide until I get out of the block... this is annoying when I build and when I'm just walking around

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:48:44 thx rick
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:49:54 they are coming
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:50:23 we are under attack of robux websites spam
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:51:42 there is more of them
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:52:17 we need to fire back but how
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:53:22 when you type **'free robux'** it writes **'<-- scammer'**
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:54:48 yeet
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:17:41 it's night?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:19:30 low stability
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:19:33 i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:21:19 maybe physics changed a bit since that time
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:40:59 what is the friction value for a block painted fabric?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:42:21 that's because I'm building a wheel and there are half fabric blocks and friction blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:43:42 no
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:44:08 I mixed fabric half blocks and friction blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:45:11 I just need the fabric half block friction value to paste it on the friction blocks so the wheel has fraction equally
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:47:40 
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:47:55 it looks exactly like a fabric painted block
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:48:31 
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:48:36 and you can set the friction
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:48:49 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:49:36 yea
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:52:01 what value do I set to a friction block so it is as much as fabric?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:53:27 it has 60% more when its value is 2?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 17:54:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:57:51 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:58:19 ok
