plane-crazy 2022-12-12 17:51:37 
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 17:52:00 Feedback is appreciated 😄
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 17:54:06 He has shaders so it looks nicer

plane-crazy 2022-12-13 08:34:26 h.
general 2022-12-13 08:35:26 Rip
general 2022-12-20 00:33:54 Did I hear “tank”?
general 2022-12-20 00:34:41 How you build all that X-X
general 2022-12-20 00:35:20 Cool, the whole building part for that length of time is the hardest part
general 2022-12-20 00:36:17 I’d just get bored say I’ll do it later then never touch it again
general 2023-02-11 23:33:18 <@900865317373374555>, how do you motorlock in Flightpoint?
general 2023-02-11 23:33:33 I tried but it just falls apart lol
general 2023-02-11 23:33:49 Ok thanks
general 2023-02-12 11:08:35 <@900865317373374555> I think there's a UI bug, others say there are multiple engines whereas I can only scroll down enough to see 1.
general 2023-02-12 16:01:34 Oh ok thanks
general 2023-02-28 22:08:32 yeah?
general 2023-02-28 22:09:14 ?
general 2023-02-28 22:09:30 ok lol
general 2023-02-28 22:09:35 back to war thunder
general 2023-03-08 16:23:04 <@900865317373374555> Whats the difference between Motor and Non Servo Motor?
general 2023-03-08 17:00:04 he has a server?
general 2023-03-18 14:06:52 Anyone know how i report people?
general 2023-03-18 14:07:01 /dam
general 2023-03-18 14:07:48 ill wait for the channel to be back up
general 2023-03-18 14:07:59 oof
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 16:50:44 Rate my WIP custom bi-plane (based of Sea Gladiator MK 1)
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:17:20 Unfortunate
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:17:34 It’s all fun and games until a few too many bullets hit your motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:18:00 True
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:21:05 The armor is what causes you to use motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:21:33 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:21:53 Also is it true that tnt blocks bullets
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:24:54 Sad
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:25:00 Bullet best anti tank weapon
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:25:24 Hmm ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:25:26 Thanks
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:25:36 So in simple terms, guns are unstoppable
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:26:24 Scary
creations-chat 2023-04-13 13:29:16 ello
creations-chat 2023-04-21 22:19:43 and what would that be
creations-chat 2023-04-21 22:22:47 confusing but good to know, thanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 23:44:11 Plane Crazy is dying for me cos idk what to make
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 23:44:16 Someone plz tell me what to make
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 23:58:35 Damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 23:58:39 To google
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 23:59:44 That’s a big chainsaw
bot-central 2023-04-27 00:00:23 !rank
bot-central 2023-04-27 00:00:32 Good enough
general 2023-04-27 03:57:55 What y’all talking about
general 2023-04-27 03:58:44 Ah ok, what ya got so far?
general 2023-04-27 04:00:36 That’s a lot
general 2023-04-27 04:01:21 Looks pretty powerful
general 2023-04-27 04:02:07 Seems like US Wealth on steroids
general 2023-04-27 04:04:00 MQ-28 looks sick
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:04:11 I say yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:04:32 Although I can’t be bothered making shredders
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:04:45 So I leave it to other people
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:04:56 And play around with the shredder
general 2023-04-27 04:05:22 I’d say they kinda easy targets
general 2023-04-27 04:06:10 Sure against ground their devastating but modern SAM technology and other aircraft could likely tear them down easy
general 2023-04-27 04:06:47 Yh
general 2023-04-27 04:08:13 I’d say it would need ***Stealth*** to survive slightly better, but it would probably still get beaten easy in combat
general 2023-04-27 04:08:43 Cos if it can do it’s mission before it’s known, it should be able to get out of the area
general 2023-04-27 04:09:13 Hm
general 2023-04-27 04:09:23 Ground Attack Role?
general 2023-04-27 04:09:51 F-35 can kinda do that unless you want a dedicated one
general 2023-04-27 04:10:30 True
general 2023-04-27 04:10:43 I’m assuming A-10 is outdated
general 2023-04-27 04:11:18 Yh
general 2023-04-27 04:11:52 SU-25 is also devastating but old
general 2023-04-27 04:13:19 Yh
general 2023-04-27 04:13:50 It’s definitely durable like SU-25 but probably can’t take more than one missile
general 2023-04-27 04:14:12 Maybe ***Su-25SM3***?
general 2023-04-27 04:15:47 I mean they have ATGM’s if I remember correctly
general 2023-04-27 04:19:52 It can launch precision strikes with bombs
general 2023-04-27 04:20:12 Which is a good part
general 2023-04-27 04:20:33 A-10 is built for payload
general 2023-04-27 04:20:46 It will always do better once it’s actually there
general 2023-04-27 04:23:10 What’s wrong with having a white name anyways
general 2023-04-27 04:24:32 Increased F-35 count?
general 2023-04-27 04:25:25 Kk
bot-central 2023-04-27 04:26:10 !help
general 2023-04-27 04:28:26 I know you have F-18s, F-35s and F-22s. But what about F-15s?
general 2023-04-27 04:29:22 Depends what for
general 2023-04-27 04:29:33 In dogfights F-16 better
general 2023-04-27 04:29:48 F-15 excellent at range though
general 2023-04-27 04:32:06 F-22 your best dogfighter and the F-16 could be a far cheaper alternative
general 2023-04-27 04:33:10 Plus F-15 could protect the KCs
general 2023-04-27 04:33:46 Oh ok
general 2023-04-27 04:33:57 Yh
general 2023-04-27 04:35:15 I’d still say ***SU-25SM3*** because it’s much faster and agile than a A-10 and still has a pretty great payload
general 2023-04-27 04:35:41 I’ve also seen deadly hits from SAMS and they managed to get back to airfields
general 2023-04-27 04:37:31 Still a existing vehicle
general 2023-04-27 04:37:42 Plus it’s faster than a A-10
general 2023-04-27 04:39:46 A A-10 will struggle to turn and dodge incoming missiles
general 2023-04-27 04:39:52 Which is sad
general 2023-04-27 04:39:59 But atleast it can probably take one hit
general 2023-04-27 04:40:14 Yh but better odds ig
general 2023-04-27 04:41:03 Yh, the 25mm is good enough for CAS, but probably only against infantry and light armor
general 2023-04-27 04:42:43 Yh
general 2023-04-27 04:43:10 Every plane is easy to destroy, a good burst or hit from a missile and it’s the end
general 2023-04-27 04:43:58 Yeah, just weaker gun and far less payload
general 2023-04-27 04:44:05 Beast mode is an option
general 2023-04-27 04:44:17 Where they mount the pylons
general 2023-04-27 04:44:34 Yh, idk how I forgot those points
general 2023-04-27 04:46:18 Plus can’t F-35 have those anti-radiation missiles to hit the SAMs and Radars
general 2023-04-27 04:46:43 Yeah
general 2023-04-27 04:48:07 <@783146411843125248> It managed to keep flying and return to the airfield, I’d say that’s better than it crashing, even if it’s gotta be scrapped
general 2023-04-27 04:51:13 According to google. ```P. Pursuit (US military aircraft designation, 1925-1947; as in P-51)```
general 2023-04-27 04:51:49 Yh I still checking but that’s the first one I found
general 2023-04-27 04:54:02 Found a clear answer now
general 2023-04-27 04:54:16 ```For pre-Korean War aircraft, P = pursuit. Examples: P-38, P-47, P-51. These changed round the Korean War period to F for Fighter.

Since then it was used for Patrol, generally maritime patrol aircraft. Examples: P-3, P-8```
general 2023-04-27 04:55:23 I’d say you should have some
general 2023-04-27 04:55:41 Anti-Submarine Warfare unless you only have room for CAS
general 2023-04-27 04:56:14 Hmm
general 2023-04-27 04:56:55 Apparently the best ASW is the P-8
general 2023-04-27 04:57:28 Hmm
general 2023-04-27 04:57:46 I mean what will you do about naval stuff though
general 2023-04-27 04:57:57 F-35s got the ground covered
general 2023-04-27 04:59:27 AC-130, A-10 and SU-25 kinda all have the problem of AA and Aircraft
general 2023-04-27 05:00:21 But Radar
general 2023-04-27 05:02:17 To be honest, the CAS aircraft shouldn’t have to worry about AA, Planes and Radars if you have so many fighters and F-35s (F-35s have anti-radiation missiles for stuff like that)
general 2023-04-27 05:04:48 Both can do CAS effectively against all targets
general 2023-04-27 05:05:23 Howitzers on AC-130 or ATGMs / massive 30MM on A-10 for heavy armor
general 2023-04-27 05:05:34 Both can decimate a building
general 2023-04-27 05:05:42 Both can erase infantry
general 2023-04-27 05:06:16 But I’d say A-10 wins at Convoy attacks and AC-130 wins at combat duration
general 2023-04-27 05:07:35 I dont think cost is a problem
general 2023-04-27 05:07:44 They have like 550 F-35s
general 2023-04-27 05:08:48 Like a war
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 22:57:02 What should i the make in the game of the plane crazy? (the military stuff only)
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 22:58:01 my pc 💀
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 22:58:15 idk how to balance sub, ship is kinda doable
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 07:28:13 It was a joke this whole time
