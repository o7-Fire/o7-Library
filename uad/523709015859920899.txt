the-dump 2020-12-03 07:44:39 has anyone actually ever laughed at the 'uwu shotgun video?'
the-dump 2020-12-03 07:45:27 i have a simpler version of it that is actually funny but coincidentally i don't have it
the-dump 2020-12-03 07:47:32 on exactly November 24 1:00 AM PST i posted a video with the urban dictionary entry for November 24 as 'beat a furry day' with the 'woo it's showtime' meme

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:15:43 like every roblox game
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:16:24 so you're telling me i can run elite dangerous at 60fps on ultra graphics but i can't run fallout 4 on low at anything higher than 30
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:17:24 explanation: fallout 4 is badly optimized

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:18:39 yes but have you ever played meridian 59
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:19:11 but would the physics be cpu, ram, or gpu usage
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:19:55 roblox should count all parts welded together as one and physics would probably run another
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:20:00 smoother*
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:20:16 i really wanna switch my phone to ubuntu
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:21:34 sadly it's not compatible
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:22:12 yes that's how graphics card work
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:22:46 my computer broke because there were too many explosions in craftwars once

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:24:14 series
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:24:24 released in 2010
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:24:49 not even joking i have a graphics card that's 10 years old

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:39:10 that's only on like the mobile version of terraria
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:39:40 yup
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:40:08 That's what the next generation is going to have to explain
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:40:43 Every single game on the Atari 2600
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:41:32 does it run ubuntu
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:42:29 I feel like sp games in the future will disable pausing to try to make money or something and that's why future generations will have to explain it
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:43:19 EA turned plants vs zombies into a cash grab do you think that they haven't thought of this
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:44:08 ea made nfs?
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:44:18 well i only have underground and undercover
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:44:31 i dont even own the system to play undercover
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:45:28 also really difficult games should do it too increase difficulty
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:46:42 I wanted to speedrun Garfield Kart but it turns out their speedrunning community was really tense and people would get like 30 seconds on the longest race

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:48:35 then, and only then, will you reach level 146 like only 1% of players
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:49:51 the end of 2020 is near but the pain is still here
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:50:57 2021 will be 2020
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:51:07 except in everywhere but the usa
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:52:33 are you in the usa
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:52:49 oh ok you probably understand then

the-dump 2020-12-03 09:53:11 discord no longer uses that format
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:53:30 also I'll tap it anyways to see the funny twist!
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:53:43 there was no funny twist
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:57:39 i have never played that game
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:58:28 Stormworks
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:58:47 it's like 30 dollars so if i get it its coming from a torrent
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:59:23 same thing
the-dump 2020-12-03 09:59:34 not worth it though the point still stands
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:00:14 piracy
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:00:31 
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:01:34 i have this pessimistic feeling that nothing will change in 2021
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:02:14 or a version of Mad Max where there's no nuclear wasteland just no government
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:02:54 when will elon musk release catgirls i've been waiting but the release date keeps getting pushed back
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:03:40 not sure
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:04:38 forcing humans to breed with cats is impossible
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:05:01 if you wanted to create a catgirl like in anime you'd have to study feline and human biology and edit genes
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:06:04 when Elon needs testing for catboys I'll volunteer as a subject
the-dump 2020-12-03 10:06:20 so anyways

the-dump 2021-02-03 16:39:23 Me (M 9) screamed "dead body reported" at my aunts funeral. My mom said  that my aunt died and that we are going to her funeral the next morning.  As soon as she left the room crying I busted put laughing because it  reminded me of among us a popular video game. So as we were riding in  the car I was thinking about saying "dead body reported" at the funeral.  When we finnaly arived I screamed "dead body reported" everyone was  looking me like if some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my  grandfather's sister fell in the vents and died when she was 2 years  old. So I said grandpa's sister sus she vented. My grandfather started  crying and everyone was screaming at me instead of laughing. My mom took  my x box and said that I am going to therapist tomorow. Idk my mom is  acting kinda sus 😂

the-dump 2021-03-29 07:48:51 am the best
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:49:20 all the time (there are lots of people who play it surprisingly)
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:49:56 not much but that's because the game is filled with small people
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:50:05 i get simps in other games
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:50:24 you'd expect to find them in places like club iris right?
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:50:26 but nope
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:50:35 in the line at border simulator

the-dump 2021-03-29 07:52:12 ive noticed that i don't get offered help as much as the odds are generally in my favor
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:52:32 people tend to be nicer in terrible games like eviction notice
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:53:30 tell them to cope and seethe
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:53:49 by simps i mean people who tried to start a roblox relationship with me
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:54:16 yeah
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:54:48 the simps did
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:55:30 i go along with the roblox relationship to inevitably break their trust just like roblox skyblox in 2014
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:56:01 they're people who date in roblox of course it's funny
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:57:07 yes
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:57:30 problem is: they continued when i told them i was male
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:57:56 nope
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:58:09 one of them was like "LMAO knew it"
the-dump 2021-03-29 07:58:25 and the other one was like "ah yeah that makes it hotter"

the-dump 2021-03-29 08:08:53 *cries loudly*
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:09:25 am not sure what an isekai is
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:09:50 all the animes i watch i have seen in memes
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:10:14 and also there's nothing funnier than high school anime girls in fucking tanks

the-dump 2021-03-29 08:12:28 it's a high school sport
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:12:47 The schools are giant battleships
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:12:57 nope
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:13:02 there are no beaches on boats
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:13:24 They have an episode in the Russian tundra however
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:13:49 the point is to disable enemy tanks
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:13:51 not kill
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:15:27 Hideri is funny because the NSFW artist in the anime forces them to go into the men's bathroom
the-dump 2021-03-29 08:15:59 One of the characters is an NSFW artist
