general 2020-12-16 09:39:41 :/
general 2021-04-20 06:00:18 Motor 2 broken again boiz
general 2021-04-20 06:00:28 Right -_-
bug-reports 2021-04-29 04:09:05 motor 2 is broken.
When spun on high rotation or idk what's that called The motor 2 glitches and instantly glitches and won't work in any key bind, Nor position.
bug-reports 2021-04-29 15:48:12 it was on max :/
bug-reports 2021-05-07 09:20:38 Piston bug:
Every time I use piston and I switch from main pilot seat to pilot seat It bug's out. By I mean by bug out is it malfunctions. It Doesn't go up or down fully. It just stays there for no reason.
bug-reports 2021-05-26 03:04:43 Impossible
bug-reports 2021-05-26 03:05:02 Oh Normal motor and motor 2 bugged like damn
bug-reports 2021-05-26 03:05:52 The (Normal Motor) kept wiggling for no reason without any block on the offset side which can cause it.
bug-reports 2021-05-26 03:06:43 The (Motor 2) goes for same reason as (Normal Motor) But more bugged than ever.
bug-reports 2021-11-13 03:10:45 Some of the wedges 2 parts are not appearing for me or other
bug-reports 2021-11-13 03:12:36 wedge down and up is gone
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:19:19 does anyone know how to add super maneuverability in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:19:35 That's not the case
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:19:41 Beside thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:20:14 Problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:20:20 Motor 2 glitched af
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:20:44 prob
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:20:48 I haven't checked yet
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:21:32 how on earth do I send images
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:21:40 Nvm
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:22:44 aight
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:22:50 fair enough I guess
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:23:08 Alr I got the thrust vectors what next ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:23:25 every time I try to make it do maneuvers
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:23:29 Like the Cobra
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:23:50 Basically every ace combat or Russian maneuver üòê
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:23:54 It just wont do it
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:24:25 It's just stuck in going from 900+ to 100+ then just like whole thing just stops and I gotta redo üòê
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:25:27 The one on the thrust vector or the one on the control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:26:14 aight
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:27:12 kinda looks like the SU-57 tbh
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:28:14 Conveyor engines without any thrust vectors just control surface works with super maneuverability
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:28:19 But I want em at low speeds :/
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:28:27 so le how
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:30:49 those are not for stealth
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:31:00 That's just better design for thrust flow
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:31:12 kinda looks like stealth shapes tbh
general 2022-07-18 11:34:24 hey guys
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 11:50:27 
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 10:04:22 My helicopter keeps shaking for no reason. Anyone has any fix for it?
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 10:10:12 Really helpful üëç
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 01:05:29 Glitter bomb be like
