plane-crazy 2021-11-02 14:15:49 me too, but he/him triggers dysphoria so i prefer they/them
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 13:49:13 ever just get the idea "what if i removed the turret on my leopard and put a shredder up front"
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 13:49:32 cool

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 16:11:35 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 06:31:42 okay so a turret made for anti air turns out to be instant death for larger helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:19:31 toay on stupid fucking ideas: what if i strapped lava spitters on a homing missile
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:20:08 it worked
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:21:55 ramming a missile into a shredder ball  soo the missile gets stuck in the ball feels good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:21:59 *boom*
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:22:49 the ball died
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:29:38 anyone got a tut for a soviet attack helicoper? i feel like being not creative

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 12:31:32 finland was allied with nono-germany and they were extremely close to leningrad at the time
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 12:31:50 the USSR were never allied with germany
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 12:31:56 it was a non aggression pact
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 12:31:59 that the germans broke
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 12:32:35 not because they're allied

plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:49:41 spread legs to hurt your fazballs
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:50:28 and possibly get cut in half
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 07:51:11 😔
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:01:27 no one told me you could leave your heli hovering with no one controlling it
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:02:09 how
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:02:49 yeah but no matter where i stand it has no effect
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:02:56 the heli just keeps flying like normal
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:03:03 nope
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:03:09 its completely stable
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:04:09 no one in the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:04:42 mine is just heli
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:04:46 i didnt do anything for this
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:04:57 i just accidentally jumped out
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:05:01 and it kept flying
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:05:09 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:05:29 nope
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:05:32 just space
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:06:02 i mean the heli has a issue where it always flies foward with like 20 speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:07:14 mine does this
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:07:22 goes up and down with control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:07:35 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:07:48 i shoud probably try something else
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:08:43 it doesnt roll
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:08:53 the only stability proplem is that it always moves foward
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 08:09:10 ima try some different rotors now

plane-crazy 2022-02-02 15:31:16 moments before disaster

plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:07:44 how and WHY is it possible for me to just jump out of my heli and it stays stable
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:08:34 but i cant make it hover
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:08:40 it always goes slowly foward
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:09:26 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:10:55 it cant go backwards either
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:11:36 dont say that to me lol, its just a modified tut
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:11:51 i made it cause i wanna start learning heli's
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:14:51 now theres the issue that it automatically goes upwards all the time
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:14:57 it hovers now tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:15:47 i did change the ballast yes

plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:18:24 wait
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 18:18:39 that could be because my avatar is seated in the left side...

plane-crazy 2022-02-22 12:12:43 so thats why the big fucken speaker i built in metal takes more hits to break than default material builds?
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 12:21:37 uhm
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 12:21:40 im not a dude lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 13:13:41 HOW THE FUKC DID SOMEONE HIT A PLANE THAT GOES 700 WITH A LAVA SPITTER
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:11:44 I followed this tut with no modeificatiopn,s and it still wont work

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBOr6KgY-eE
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:17:08 bruh im just trying to learn helicoter basics
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:25:11 OH SDHOOT
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:25:15 wrong message replied
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:25:37 i came here to ask if there was something wrong with the tut, not what tuts to use thanks
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:26:36 i asked if there was a proplem with the tut i used for fucks sake, i could not care less about "Oh bUt ThIs GuY iS mUcH bEtTeR"
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:30:07 well im starting to think that updates to the game changed the way this rotor works, cause i used it before and it had the same problem
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:31:22 its the one where rocket engines make it spin, you use Q and E to go up and down
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:31:35 would you shut the fuck up already?
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:32:03 well the good thing is that the heli works perfect as car B)
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:32:46 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:33:20 its like 99.99% of this server expect new people to just know everything as soon as they start the game
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:34:31 ~~im going back to build a boat for treasure~~
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 15:35:00 i have a feeling Plane Crazy kinda just murdered it

if you dont use it on explode on impact bombs your plane will go pow if your shot at
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 13:31:59 and the detonate key should be the same asd the one you press to drop bombs
the-dump 2022-02-24 13:34:55 i've never had lean

plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:10:49 that cause then i can actually use it for aiming the rockets on the heli
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:11:19 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:11:30 but it actally helps sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:12:19 i dont have anything to shoot backwards other than a rotating gun soooo
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:12:22 and its a heli
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:12:28 it dont rly get into dogfights
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:16:04 and yes, its at the bottom of the glas
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:16:14 but its centered
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 19:14:15 ever just build a replica of a area in your friends plane to design bombs

plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:30:48 i will probably add a ♠️ when i get my fifth
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:31:10 and then at the 10th kill you'd have 2
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:31:51 jesus
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:32:33 i mean i only count planes i shot down with another plane using rockets or guns, if i counted kamikaze or airstrikes..
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:32:40 i'd have..
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:32:46 idk 10 ace's
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:34:02 okay theres nothing as scary as someone who can defeat a plane using a dropped bomb
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:35:27 honestly the only reason my kill count is so low is that theres no one using fighter planes in any pvp server i go to
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:35:57 i mean yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:36:18 ok seriously

plane-crazy 2022-03-15 07:35:15 h e l p
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 07:36:59 when your largest build is related to the war so you cant post it <:husk:892731762080378891>

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 12:58:43 how to defeat shredders part one
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 12:59:34 step one: make any car
step two: fill it with tnt
step three: wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 12:59:49 the only problem is they only fall for it ones
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 13:01:24 hmm.. whats a way to make a lag machine that is not just spammed ballz
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 13:01:32 that absolutely murders servers
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 13:02:05 its fun to see shredder uses suffer okay
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 13:02:17 horse
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:18:14 how to be me:
step 1: take mad vulpen tut plane
step 2: put hover engines anywhere you can
step 3: SPEED
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:18:32 speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:18:40 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:18:57 the original tut goes like 600 i think, so i made it go 1900
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:19:01 cause
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:19:03 i dont know
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:19:08 i like making things go fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:19:17 but suck at making okay looking planes
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:20:03 cause i have severe skill issue thats why
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:21:23 ok furry

wait..
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 18:22:45 the first time i made a plane myself people still called me a tut user
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:03:26 some shredder just called me a toxic tryhard
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:03:29 i asked him why
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:03:47 he said "stop making your planes so fast that i cant get them"
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:04:46 i embarrased him even more by saying "dude this is a completely unmodified tut.. it goes 300 and you cant get it"
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:05:14 you dont think he rage quit?
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:08:52 he was mad because i was too fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:09:14 tbh this was done just cause i dont like loosing, some dude told me tut planes cant be faster than 600 soooo...

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:41:13 fist i replaced super rockets with hover engines..
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:41:41 then i looked for any hole to put more engines without breaking the motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:42:22 aw fuck
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:42:46 donzo
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:44:54 my graphics card decided to turn into a frying pan.. uhm one sec
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:52:22 and no theres absolutely no reason for me to have a tut plane that goes 1900 speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 07:55:17 l + no imagination + cant see the a r t
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 12:09:55 that thing probably fills the entire plot when unloaded

plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:10:13 🤯
general 2022-06-22 19:13:36 should i turn on "ignore others" on thrusters for hover engines
general 2022-06-22 19:14:02 ah
general 2022-06-23 09:57:59 anyone got a good jetengine sound for speakers?
general 2022-06-23 09:58:39 good idea
general 2022-06-23 12:31:37 wat the hel even is that
general 2022-06-23 12:32:39 there should be a setting on TNT blocks so that if any part of your plane hits the ground they explode

why?

cause cool lookin crash's
general 2022-06-23 12:33:19 right that channel exists
general 2022-06-23 12:34:02 yes but its when any part is hit, like lets say a regular half block is hit then every single tnt block in the plane goes pow
general 2022-06-23 12:34:39 arm on key
general 2022-06-23 12:35:26 if arm on key is enabled tnt blocks wont go pow before that key is pressed
general 2022-06-23 12:36:14 its funny how its always the dudes with bacon or free item avatars who are the GOD TIER builders
general 2022-06-23 12:38:27 its

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:35:49 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:36:05 the a10 is a gatling gun with a plane mounted onto it
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:37:03 ok so this is the result of me mesing around with sounds
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:37:56 one thing

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:38:18 makes it look bettter
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:40:51 oh shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:48:22 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:48:48 ngl u should be able to pvp blacklist people, so that they cant deal damage to you.

of course u wouldn't be able to damage them either
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:50:59 we're in the sane server
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:53:09 **you got a hole in your right wing**
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:56:16 i rly wanna try making a plane that steers the same way as planes in war thunder
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:00:18 made this with one purpose, trigger the entire pc community
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:01:36 this is why
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:01:56 more like a railgunturret mounted on a tut truck
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:02:18 i wasn't going to
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:02:30 literally the only thing i made myself was the turret rotation
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:02:37 which btw is not motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:02:53 i have to manually steer it to the sides and up and down
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:03:14 
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:03:55 well i kinda just used a tut truck cause i was lazy, the thing i was trying to build was a railgun turret not a truck so i didnt have time to design one
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:03:58 so yeha tut
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:04:28 i'd say 85%
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:05:18 fireyoblivion's guides tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 21:05:25 :gigachad:
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:29:33 people are annoying
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:43:15 fuck you, motorlocked gun turret mounted on tutorial truck
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:43:19 
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:44:53 i aalso mounted a quad magnet gun turret on a tut truck
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:45:14 i literally just have mad vilpans truck saved for putting turrets on
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:45:21 too lazy to build as truck myself
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:47:16 i dont have any ships
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:49:28 why tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:49:31 why would i do that
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 09:53:12 plane crazy pvp servers be like: 
*spawn kills you multiple times*
*gets mad at you when you target them one time*

plane-crazy 2022-07-22 10:35:12 thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 18:04:04 welcome bacl to another episode of "What can we mount on MadVulpens german truck?"
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 20:42:59 fr*nch
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 20:44:27 its already like that
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 20:44:29 DEX_DK
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:20:11 ngl Namnam's pvp jet guides are really good
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:20:33 not the tutprials u idior
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:20:36 the guides
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:21:30 well i wont do that
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:21:57 the guide is based on a pvp Sukhoi
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:22:01 im gonna build an f15
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:22:05 but follow the guide
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:22:28 which means ill have the guide and some f15 blueprints
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:22:53 but to be fair every pvp plane ever looks the damn same
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:23:26 ok well if u took 2 pvp f15 planes built by 2 different people
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:23:34 they'd probably look kinda the same
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:24:40 actually what plane should i try to build
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:24:43 as a pvp plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:24:56 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:25:13 having to build something from somewhat scratch is hard enough already <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:25:24 whyy
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:25:42 otll just end up looking like a f15 or f14 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:26:07 FUCK YOU IM BUILDING A PVP ANTONOV 225
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:26:18 PRETTY SURE I'LL BE THE FIRST

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:27:37 ill start off slow, use guides while building, and base it ona  real plane,
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:27:47 then after that when im more experienced ill make a custom
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 17:28:42 this still isn't enough to carry ur mom

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:38:30 ur opinion is invalid
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:39:31 OH NO
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:39:33 IM DEFEATED
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:39:50 peeerrrfect
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:41:20 are suggesting using small gear instead of tiny?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:42:01 its not even an f15 anymore anyway cause i kinda wanna make something on my own instead so the intake being low dont matter
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:43:22 its a 1x1 so that might be why
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:43:56 i could edit it a bit and use a pyramid wedge on the nose to make it a bit less sharp but idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:44:33 yeahh.. would take too much work
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:44:43 and i like how it is rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:46:18 this kinda does the job already
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:46:29 and again it dont matter to me that much im gonna use it for pvp anyway
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:49:11 i mean this is kinda my first time doing something almost all by myself
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:49:37 ive kinda just gotten back into plane crazy, all my saves were full of tuts lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:50:02 wings too small maybe?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:50:14 
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:50:27 k
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:50:47 also its only the outer panels on pvp wings that are actual wing panels right
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:50:52 rest are trap doors
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:52:02 oh and also which looks best?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:53:13 right one it is pfft
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:53:46 it was supposed to be an f15 but it will probably just become some blorsed looking custom
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:54:51 sand
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:54:59 still too small?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:55:22 AAAA
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:55:29 ill make them right in between then
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:56:10 well kinda
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:56:17 its not anything super detailed
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:57:26 aight ill use these wings
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:57:44 not i dont know if i should put hover engines inside the intake or in the middle of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 19:58:41 now that i think of it most of the motor lock will be in the moddle sooo
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:03:51 dis how im supposed to do the wings right
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:06:02 nah
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:06:32 literally every pvp plane guide i find says do this so ill try it
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:06:40 if it fail i try something else
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:06:47 yes almost
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:07:18 why?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:08:42 yeah thats also what im going for

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:13:34 k, now i gotta find out why the inner trap doors wond stay on
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 20:15:28 pfft

plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:43:44 afterburners
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:47:47 they look even better with a jet engine behind them
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:47:56 like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:48:33 cant show the result cause the lack of steeinr makes the plane rotate violently when the jets are attached <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:49:44 also i didn't rly make them myself

plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:51:30 namnam's pvp jet guide is decent
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:52:14 its literally the only detailed guide on pvp jets wtf are people supposed to use othewr than that 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:52:37 yes, a lot of people just sue it as a tut and copy their sukhoi from the guide
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:53:33 i just used the guide for things such as wings, controlls, etc
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:53:41 i designed my pwn plane tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:56:47 like, i didn't know how to make trap door wings so i used the guide
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:57:09 1 wide canopys were also new to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 18:07:20 i dont think this guy understands how a 1wider works
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 18:32:45 the motors wong fokking move

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:11:53 i dont think plane crazy supports vr
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:12:24 🤨 📸
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:14:36 this is so cursed
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:15:34 thats what happens when you open all the rapådoors in a 1wide
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:24:45 best build ever
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:24:46 simple
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:25:41 ok so i just finished my first ever pvp jet and.. i didnt even mean to make it that way but its perfect for countering shredders pffft

plane-crazy 2022-08-01 17:33:05 being able to fly perfectly stable at any speed between 200-1500sps is amazing

plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:09:27 what skilled opponents does to an mf
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:09:49 a pvp jet i made
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:10:01 it basically looks like a scuffed f15
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:10:31 it looks like this when not almost destroyed
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:10:40 
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:13:44 its my first pvp jet ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:19:05 im very aware
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:19:12 i tried like 3 times to make it look good
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:19:23 i died make a decent one with more seperated ruddewrs
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:19:35 but the motorlock made the plane perfom terribly
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:19:57 and no adding another tower with wings to stabilise it did not work
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 09:20:20 i added so many that when it was finally stable enough it could only go 500
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:39:56 
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:40:52 studs ber second

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:22:31 i just dont know what tank to build, like..
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:22:38 i was thinking about the puma IFV
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:40:59 puma it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:49:29 .
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:49:38 right...

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:57:08 the back will be a bit of a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 09:57:34 omay why havent i built tanks before.. this actually looks kinda good
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:00:37 ye

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:01:05 got a 3d model to help tho, really huge help ngl
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:01:12 yep...
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:01:31 the turret will DEFIANTLY have exposed motorlock from the locked gun
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:01:57 wither that or i will have an ugly as hell gunbarrel
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:09:22 cause i dont have the skill
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:09:27 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:09:46 i know but still
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:10:02 also having a huge amount of motorlock on a pvp tank would make it kinda easy to kill
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:10:17 hit the mechanisms correctly and you glitch the entire thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:10:45 
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:10:53 protec
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:12:47 well
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:12:56 what you see is just the frame
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:13:05 every block that isn't exposed is tnt
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:13:21 
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:14:14 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:15:40 looks super good
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:15:45 anyway now i have an issue
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:15:51 the tank tips over when turning
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:15:53 how to fox?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:18:27 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:18:35 right now it turns with regular rockets
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:18:46 
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:22:54 is there a way to use motors for turning without having 2 motors for each wheel
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:29:16 figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:29:50 the wheels (used to) just go back and forward
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:29:53 i fixed it
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:30:05 i did
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:30:08 i figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:30:32 but if i only used motors for turning i wouldnt be able to turn while moving foward so i added propellers too
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:31:56 well i figured something out that works now
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:32:11 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:32:15 and motor
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 10:32:16 both

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:23:13 I sorta forgor how many blocks is used but.. if its 400 u guys think its possible to get terrain lvl 1?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:23:24 Smh
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:23:30 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:25:10 I mean.. my OFV meets all the requirements i just forgot how many blocks i used
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:25:34 Im on mobilr

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:29:01 I mean.. its made up of mostly single tnt blocks cause its a pvp tank so i wouldnt be surprised if its 400+
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:29:13 How tf does that look like a maus
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:30:04 Maus: big fucking tank bit fucking turret
This thing: an ifv with a small unmanned turret
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:30:32 The maus still looks way different
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:31:35 The sides of a maus is flat this one is round the front of a mause is short and is only wedged on the upper plate this thing has a long wedge both on the upper and lower
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:32:22 Oh well, its an ifv and i like it
general 2022-09-05 10:06:45 quidk question, to get designer rank III do i need to have 50 upvotes more than the downvotes or just 50 in general
general 2022-09-05 10:08:16 i'll ask in a more simple way, will 61(up) and 35(down) get me designer rank III
general 2022-09-05 10:08:36 wholesome
general 2022-09-05 10:09:53 zamn

bruh that means im like 4 away from rank II 💀
general 2022-09-05 10:10:18 it isnt cause II needs 30
general 2022-09-05 10:10:24 ill just get I
general 2022-09-05 10:12:03 who would've thought a type of build ive never done before, a fucken PVP tank would get 61 upvotes
general 2022-09-05 10:12:07 how
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 12:41:58 suicidal IFV
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 14:17:25 its a custom 😭
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 14:17:26 somewhat
general 2022-09-05 14:19:27 lmao i love how as soon as i make a ticket to get designer rank 1 my IFV reaches a score of 30
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 15:36:55 I changed my IFV a bit, so now its the IFV-1a3
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 15:37:10 first IFV ive ever built, and its the third modification
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 15:50:50 its not really a puma, was supposed to but i ended up making it slightly custom
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 15:59:35 hold on ima just make a BM-13 katyusha to delete that thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 16:10:30 3judging by the fact that its a mech, all i need to do is remove the leg and you're sent floating to space
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 16:24:35 are you using control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 16:28:40 ill just build one of those machines that make you glitch the fuck as soon as you come into slight contact with it
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 16:47:09 if you dont even know how to make custom flaps yet then... definitely dont try helis yet
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 17:07:41 shoutout to the guy and his 2 friends who in a passenger plane did everything they could to do an emergency landing even after i cut their tail wings and rudders of
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 17:07:46 they succeeded
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 19:37:08 having someone think ur build is a tut feels like an accomplishment
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 19:39:06 what abiut that one roscale mig 21 tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 19:40:09 ive seen it everywhere but never saw the vid
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 19:51:49 TWW community: turned into toxicit cause of lazy devs and lack of updates on game
PCC: literally always been hell

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:27:24 Namnam: im gonna make this a guide so you dont mindlessly copy like its a tut
Players: *mindlessly copies like its a tut*
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:29:43 Pffft
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:30:26 I might just make a videi that says its a tut on my puma then build a crappy version using regular wheels and shit
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:30:33 Like a super shit version
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:30:42 Of this
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:31:16 Remember vulpens mi24 where he said there wouldnt be a tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:31:19 I found 3 people
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 07:31:21 Asking for tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:06:54 i love how whenever 2 pvp tanks are in a game they just drive around some random place and bump into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:07:02 pvp tank builders are truely wholesome creatures
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:07:57 fr
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:09:40 goofy ahhh
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:10:01 if you make that and its able to fit a 1 wider plane then you will defiantly get hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:10:04 no doubt
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 15:20:01 1 or 2 SAM missles and thats 960 million worth of fighters gone

plane-crazy 2022-09-07 08:19:25 funny to think tank fish started as a plane crazy youtuber
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 08:40:57 his builds were up to standards
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 08:41:02 2019 standards
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 08:41:10 which makes sense cause its 3 years ago

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:43:39 ill make one simalar size as my friends then
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:43:45 except a different ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:44:33 mine will be a Iver Huitfeldt-class frigate
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:45:41 actually nvm it has too complicated angles and i am in no way ready for angle lock ships
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:45:43 Knud Rasmussen-class patrol vessel it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 15:49:48 ok.. are these good placed for folds?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:04:01 i mean..
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:05:52 what
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:05:54 for what
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:07:22 this is my first ship y'know... im not that good yet
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:08:19 whenever i try somehting for the first time i stay away from large amounts of motorlock and angle lock stuff
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:08:25 i hope it will be
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:08:32 ngl slate deck does a huge difference..
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:18:27 this will be a pain
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 16:19:34 does anyone even care about the rotors <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:10:34 pain
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:12:42 it did what its supposed to tho
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:14:09 oh what i would do for L/RCorner Wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:14:20 but nope
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:14:30 as the only wedge block its limit is 1x3 instead of 1x4

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:24:35 what happens if i use huver engines to power a ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:24:40 like, just to make it silent
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:24:42 somewhat
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:25:23 helopter
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:25:59 bru tell him about fucking control surfaces 😭
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:27:22 i use a pvp jet so the amount of kills i have already would be at least 5400mb of storage <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:27:33 if i took a pic of each
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:32:17 could this possibly mean im the first to build that vessel
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:36:28 try using custon flaps instead of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:37:24 i was talkign about wasd, m2m is something you use for pvp jets
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 17:37:27 mostly

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:47:11 ᵗʰᵃᵗ'ˢ ʲᵘˢᵗ *PLANE* **CRAZY**
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:49:07 real
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:51:01 well shit
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:51:35 how is it already the largest build ive ever made
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:53:30 plane crazy boat builders after making a boat that doesnt float at all
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:55:27 how to make ship not tilt
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:56:55 what i meant is how do i make it not tilt and almost go upside down as soon as it hits the water
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:57:14 AAEEHH
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:57:41 however something tells me i should focus on that stuff when the entire boat is done
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:58:13 so a fuckload of ballast tanks or blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:58:37 i have this thing in the middle tho
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:58:47 its what locks the propeller in place
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 18:59:21 funny
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:04:50 FUCKING
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:05:22 good idea
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:06:28 true true i agree with your statement
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:12:40 and its impossible to get rid of this ugly mf'er?
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:14:05 and what rgb is that
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:14:45 theres prolly a way but i'd rather have a motor haning arousn that no one rly cares about than some super complex stuff
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:22:31 i actually think it will only need 1 fold
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:22:54 that means i could've made it bigger <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:27:35 yeah but first i thought i would have to fold it like this (image), turns out it only needs 2 folds so it could have been a big bigger
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:27:55 but ngl this is already huge
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:28:30 im not gonna redo the entire build now
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:29:01 larger
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:29:17 besides 15 wide is kinda a usual size
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:29:32 ill make it bigger thenext time i build a ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:30:10 ok heres something you rarely see

oil rig
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:32:27 wont be surprised if i'll be able to get shipwright IV with this 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:32:36 how is an unfinished build already 1200 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:33:08 the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:33:13 how
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:33:48 MoBiLe UsEr
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:34:04 sucks
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:34:30 i have a pc that can fly that oine AN 255 tut on 60 fps
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:34:44 yes i spent time building a massive 2 hour tut just to test my pc
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:34:53 and being able to fly that thing at 160 fps
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:34:54 jesus
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:38:09 progress
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:40:36 should i make a woring crane
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 19:51:11 
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:08:37 make the small plane
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:08:42 ez
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:09:25 they're mid
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:09:38 the pvp fighters are pretty good for what they're supposed to do
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:09:43 which is kill people
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:10:42 theres a huge differenc ebetween average namnam jet copier and namnam guide user
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:10:58 the copier thinks he rules the world cause he copied aa super mid fighter
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:11:06 the user is a soon to be pvp god
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:11:24 cause he instead of copying just used the guide for what its suppose to be
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:11:28 fr
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:11:30 tlike
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:11:36 the guides are GOOD
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:12:20 it doesnt count as namnam unless its a literal copy of namnam's plane from the guide
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:13:45 pvp fighters are usually mobile as hell but they dont look very good when moving
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:13:47 m2m
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:13:47 cause
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:13:58 liek ti can do loops but it aint as smooth as wasd
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:14:06 but besides aiming with was is hell
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:14:17 basically control panels but cooler
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:14:36 its custom flaps that move with mouse
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:15:03 its like.. 10 times better than a wing made out of control panels
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:15:19 its a decent method
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:15:32 its easier to aim with it
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:15:38 public yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 06:15:51 they're good for 1x1 missles
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 08:14:31 progress
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 08:31:05 vessel funny
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 08:41:43 seems ill need even more folding on the top

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:49:14 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:49:27 ...

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:09 i looked at speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:12 and i repeat
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:13 slow
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:29 for what looks to be a pvp fighter its slow
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:36 mine goes 1500
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:52:48 hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:53:08 i make it stable by throwing a bunch of wings on a motorlock tower and call it a day
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:53:34 thats normal for a tank
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 17:54:11 s h i p

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:13:02 very awkward folds
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:14:09 they do work decent on pvp planes




and fuck all of you, namnams guides are decent for starters
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:28:22 how tf do i make it like this
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:28:32 
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:30:33 a guy with shipwright III doesnt even know <:empty:794431705070174238>

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:30:45 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:31:03 im assuming its not even possible
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:31:25 yes but the think im building has it like that
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:31:37 motorlock..?
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:31:43 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:10 yes but mine is even worse 😭
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:21 how the fuck do i aven
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:41 at all
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:41 ok i cna do it but it wont look smooth
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:42 or
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:32:50 i can make it differenct and have it smooth
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:33:08 probabbly a good idea
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:33:16 the ship isnt accurate either
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:33:18 like
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:33:19 at all
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:33:22 a little maybe
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:34:31 modern frigates have a lot of awkward shapes that are basically impossible to make even with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:34:39 ESPECIALLY the danish vessels
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:36:19 perhaps because theres a much MUCH simpler way of 90 degree folds
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:39:03 current ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:41:39 excuse me..?
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:58:08 i cant get a good front
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:58:09 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 19:58:26 the ship also has this kinda awkward shape

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:06:06 i could make regular sized wings instead of half block wide ones but that would make it look a bit worse
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 18:31:51 i swear large planes will defiantly be more popular when we get inf map
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 18:32:02 bombers will be mopre fun thats for sure
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 19:26:02 how the fuck do i make a bomb bay

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 20:40:47 it ISNT a mad vulpen tut

plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:07:40 i wont make an apache
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:07:49 it'll end up looking like vulpens tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:07:56 could be an option
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:08:38 facts
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:08:47 they cool AF tho
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:09:07 also can we talk about how the frogfoot became severely overbuilt after the WT update
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:09:10 same with the f14
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:09:14 when it was added
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:09:47 scuffed apache on gud
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:11:25 i could build that maybe
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:12:03 it doesnt have too many confusing angles... and it looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:12:18 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:13:09 actually ill start off with the KA 50 just cause it has thew double rotor which is probably the best rotor type for people who are just starting to build helis
plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:13:55 boys im ready to go

plane-crazy 2022-09-20 18:17:00 i will only use it on helys that acre actually double rotor
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:22:37 whats a more accurate size for the MI28, 3 wide or 2 wide
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:23:42 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:23:56 i just want the scale to be somewhat accurate to real life
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:25:07 k
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:25:18 3 wider it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 18:25:46 just saying i do not posses the ability to make it a super detailed motorlock stuff
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 12:51:04 some dude calling my plane a tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 12:51:24 i get that it looks like the namnam jet but also not
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:14:25 that is true
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:15:24 while i find namnams guide super good its still annoying how it causes every 1 wider user to be called namnam tut
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:15:36 its average 😢
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:16:18 resisting the urge to ping nam for no reason at all
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:17:39 im debating rather or not i should use trap door wings or regular wings on my F-18
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:18:07 let me guess you literally only watched the part about wobble
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:18:41 well maybe it was because you already knew the other things when you watched it <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:19:17 you do realise the light airframe is mostly for speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:19:30 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:19:43 except i used the guide to make a 1400 sps pvp jet
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:20:12 could it be, and hear me out, this may shock you, because most things in public pvp is slow as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:20:43 if you're fighting something slow its easier to hit it if you're flying the same speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:20:44 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:14 thats why i find planes that are stable at both the speed of fucking sound and like 100 sps very useful
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:39 okay why the fuck does this look pretty cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:50 no it doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:54 how is it supposed to manuver
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:55 if its not
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:56 fucking
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:21:57 moving
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:22:10 well then its not 0sps
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:22:25 if you're going o sps yopu're simply not moving
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:26:02 well im talking about your plane still being able to turn at fucking 50
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:26:04 which is hard
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:27:17 alr if my plane still glitches when using trap door wings ill use normal wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:27:19 if it doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:27:24 ill use trap door
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:27:38 for the one reason i like the look of it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:33:13 tf u want
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:33:47 its harder in pvp jets cause due to them natuarlly being smol asf you often dont have space to add propellers
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 13:33:55 besides you cant rly mouse control propellers

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:03:58 ik
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:04:14 its a bit hard to make 1 widers not blocky
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:04:29 aaaeeehhh
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:04:30 motor lock pain
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:05:04 still a huge improvement from the old one already
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:05:17 unless i want terrible looking in takes then yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:05:45 i guess, my old pvp plane was my first so
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:05:48 looks kinda trash
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:05:58 looks nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:07:11 not sure if the intakes a bit too thick for a wider
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:07:25 
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:09:00 i love making these planes and not think about where i out the engines and weapons
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:11:40 its nothing near finished and im already proud of it <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:16:30 the nono symbol is a symbol of hate, the hammer and sickle is just communism
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:16:34 so yes its allowed
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:17:01 fUucK
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:17:13 depends on the type
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:17:22 the nono german version is mirrord
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:31:32 le progress
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:31:39 no clue where i put the engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:32:14 
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:32:37 its kinda hard to copy a plane that they didnt use in the guide ppft
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:32:52 but i am building it based on what i learned from the guide and my old pvp fighter
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:33:13 but also motorlock go brrr
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:34:58 found space
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:39:28 what
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:54:18 idk its hard to make 1 widers look variant accurate
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:54:22 so just F 15 i guess
general 2022-09-28 14:56:56 ok hear me out, planes that are able to switch between wasd and m2m without despawning
general 2022-09-28 14:58:04 would probably be a bit challengign on 1 widers but probably also super useful
general 2022-09-28 14:58:20 fucks sake

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:30:57 i simply put toe broke by puttiong a "russian nose" on a nato jet
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:34:52 No.
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:35:02 it looks mid with nato style
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:35:23 its better than my old one
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:35:57 this one looks somewhat like an f15 unlike the older version
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:38:51 i guess
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:38:58 its hard to make it look acuurate
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:39:21 im trying to make these

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:40:33 its my second 1 wider ever
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:40:46 and you dont get as much space to work with as on 2 widers
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:42:19 i did, and it looks worse
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:42:25 im keeping the pyramid nose
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:53:52 ok but i'd prefer having it plain black ice when the canopy is loaded with wing panels and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 18:54:38 this is my old plane with wing glass canopy

plane-crazy 2022-09-29 13:14:56 if done correctly visible motorlock can look good somehow <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 13:15:09 oh come on at at least i didnt use trap door wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 13:15:31 i also used a pyramid nose for a Nato plane which namnam doesnt

plane-crazy 2022-09-29 13:22:16 a wise man once said "if you didnt make it accurate just call it a custom and all is fine"

plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:06:38 i guess
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:07:30 meh
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:07:43 i fixed the exposed motorlock by using cam angled wings tho
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:09:25 its a custom so it dont matter
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:10:26 if it was a namnam clone it would have trap door wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:11:15 i used trap doors cause disconectors broke the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 06:12:24 that gave me an idea

plane-crazy 2022-10-15 08:26:43 "Making tanks accurate require aot of motorlock cause of hoe detailed they are"

plane-crazy 2022-11-17 10:53:21 i want to make my Pe8 accurate.. but thats so tiny
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 10:53:43 ik
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 10:54:29 ill try to keep it somewhat accurate
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 10:55:32 it will probably be a bit oversized
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:02:23 ok it will be very oversized
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:04:38 just a tiny winy bit too big
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:10:52 ok yeah its gonna be a very large bomber
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:12:20 its already too large to be a PE8 lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:12:24 and this is just the nose
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:12:29 it'll be a 5 wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:12:52 beeg
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:13:02 i'll prolly end up having to fold the body AND wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:15:08 im gonna try to give it thicc wings

plane-crazy 2022-11-18 14:38:11 building a 5 wide bomber inspired by the PE8
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 14:38:24 probably just gonne end up as BIG pe8
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 14:41:35 thats gonna be a problem
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 14:48:03 how fast

plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:00:31 bobmer
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:08:09 whats bvest
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:09:57 getting a plane this large airborn will be interesting
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:11:08 considering im planning on giving it custom wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:11:09 as in
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:11:20 possible 2 block wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:20:09 w i d e
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:45:35 im gonna have to use a tutorial for the ball turrewt on my bomber cause no way im able to make that on my own
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:48:43 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:48:47 so im using a tut
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:49:20 a lot of the time simple things as the turret and landing gear are tuts/guides when i make a type of build for the first time, in this case a large bomber
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 15:57:35 i mean its useful
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 16:07:54 oh hey it worked
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 16:09:30 nah
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 16:09:50 i used a tut for this turret

plane-crazy 2022-11-18 18:55:38 i thought they were attached to the blocks thatmake up the nose but were colored wrong lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 18:56:49 lets hope my bomber doesnt end up looking like a vulpen tut like it did last time
plane-crazy 2022-11-18 18:57:25 🥶

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:14:27 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:14:40 and what block do you want the folding cam to be attached to

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:17:03 not to doa  full 90 degree turn
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:17:26 "it isnt hard to do" mfers when they realise not everyone has 5 yeard of experience
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:19:07 oh well no matter how i do it its a aeronautical engineer IV secured anyway
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:19:18 pain
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:27:19 the STRV103 is the worst tank to ever exist and i have multiple things personally against its existance
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:27:31 also
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:27:43 BrO iTs EaSy JuSt UsE MoToR
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:27:57 motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:27:58 ez
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:28:30 ok heres what you do
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:29:34 step 1: take ur strv103 build
step 2: delete everything
step 2: build strv 122 instead cause the strv 103 is so fucking ugly
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:29:43 done
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:05 same thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:07 still ugly
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:13 and its just ew
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:22 its swedish
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:37 actually everytime you get the idea of building something swedish
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:42 scrap that idea
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:30:48 build something else
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:32:01 love is not real
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:32:09 fuck the strv 103
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:32:15 fucking cheese wedge looking ahh
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:32:18 useless
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:32:52 "ItS a DeFeNcE tAnK" no its the result of swedish tank designers getting lost when they cant just copy the centurion or the leopard 2
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:33:24 that thing is israelian for fucks sake
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:33:29 it has nothing to do with this
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:33:48 besides its just the result of jews seeing too much sci fi
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:34:18 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:34:31 its an actual somewhat good design of israeli tank designers getting lost when they cant just copy the centurion or leopard 2
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:34:36 still scheisse
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:34:47 but less scheisse than the 103
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:35:11 CAUSE WHO THE FUCK CAME UP WITH THE BRILLIANT PLAN OF MAKING THE GUN MOVEMENT BASED ONLY ON THE TANK MOVEMENT ITSELF
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:36:58 it protects the crew until someone with more than 2 iq shoots the tracks off making the tank completely defenseless
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:37:15 *shoot track*

*go behind it*
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:37:21 boom
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:37:22 ez
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:37:43 swedes: 0 people with brain: 1
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:44:56 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:44:58 shoot wheel
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:45:07 🤷
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:45:41 or better, shoot the gun
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:47:12 i dont even get the hype of swedish tanks
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:47:26 they're all copies of better designs and the ones that aren't are just fucking stupid
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:47:50 the BKan is an exception to what i said
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:47:52 i must admit that
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:49:07 thats just a mom can we have BTR
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:49:57 that thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:49:58 is so
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:49:59 fuckin
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:50:02 ugly

ikea shark good
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:53:29 Blåhaj*
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:54:33 people always like "haha strv 103 funny" not realising how fucking outdated it is
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:54:42 we're still not talking war thunder
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:55:35 strv 103 shit
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:55:49 but im danish so i HAVE to despise it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:56:25 bro
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:56:28 ¨the leopard 1
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:56:31 is outdated
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:57:05 it getting into sertvice same time as the first leopard 1 doesn't make it less outdated
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:57:22 in fact it proves my point of it being O L D
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:57:40 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:57:46 so by todats standards
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:57:47 its shet
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:58:05 no
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:58:16 i was always talking about todaus standards
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:58:17 and
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 00:58:19 it is shit
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:00:25 swedish tree is irellevant
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:00:27 and it should be
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:00:30 fuck sweden
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:00:34 heheheha
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:01:06 i let stalin guide me to victory with my russian bias 😈
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:01:33 t34 won the war!!! *insert crying wojak
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:02:06 when you think about it what made the sherman so great wasn't the firepower or the armor
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:02:59 it was cheap as hell and you could just keep rolling out new ones, and if you had a sherman you could literally do anything to it! need a SPAA? sherman becomes skink! need bigger gun? just put bigger gun on it!
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:03:12 sherman = good
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:03:19 sherman good
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:03:50 stfu wehraboo
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:03:54 anime pfp
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:04:27 sounds like something a wehraboo would say
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:04:36 sherman = good

t34 = mid
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:05:32 what tanks are good then
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:05:36 lemem guess
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:05:39 panzer 3
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:06:15 thats like every tank, a panzer 3 is easy to kill too
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:06:52 how to kill t34: shoot the side with a panzer 3

how to kill panzer 3: shoot the side with a t34

its literally the same
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:07:17 the 103 is also easy to kill
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:07:47 true
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:08:11 "t34 bad cause easy to kill" mfers realising tank design is not just about putting more and more armor on the thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:08:33 or if you just stop whining and get good
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:08:42 i embraced soviet bias
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:09:04 the t34 is a decent tank at its battle rating end of story

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:11:06 idc 😈
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:11:36 airbrake wont do shit if you put enough engines on it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:12:14 that removes the ability to have the engines running while standing still
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:13:12 thick wings 😈
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:14:08 me on my way to spawn a large plane in pvp mode just to get shredded before even having folded
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:15:46 nah
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:15:52 dang
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:19:58 all that effort put into the shape just to have a unrealistic wing thickness
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:25:48 we do not care
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:28:01 Welcome.
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:28:05 Ilearned it a while ago
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:29:38 i am new cause i took a break
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:30:38 
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:31:02 !!!!!
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:31:37 thats right, shut up
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:31:43 yuh
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:32:22 shut up young man
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:32:29 respect your elders
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:33:06 Claustrophobia.
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 01:33:31 real
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 09:52:25 I remember i tried making a 1 wide F18

it for some reason bugged out when spawning sending me flying in a random direction with 10x the speed of light so i scrapped the idea
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:03:24 It gets easy when you get the hang of it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:04:13 When i built my F15 i just started by trying to build the part i needed without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:04:27 If it didn't work i did it with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:07:05 But my F15 also looks very beginner ish
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:07:16 Zero custom angles
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:45:17 camoflage
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 10:45:21 camoflage is real
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:07:04 wing fold time
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:07:43 its designed after the PE8 but its H U G E
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:08:17 shipwright IV doesnt require a score, its shipwright V and up that does
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:08:52 so yeah you can literally just make a box that floats and get the role as long as its the required block amount
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:10:41 i also have the funny leaf, however
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 11:11:05 look at the image

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:52:15 i dont really care about all these so called remakes of AP, im waiting for the official sequal
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:53:00 yeah cause its just "i sweitched the icons on items and re textured the terrain and now its a remake"
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:54:02 ooo

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:54:44 yeah and im broke
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:55:04 oooh.. so its just a graphics rework?
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:55:24 im sure it'll be decent
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:56:01 they probably have like a fuck load of content that they're just not putting on the early acess just to troll us <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 19:59:44 well shit
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:00:35 someone managed to hit my bomb with their machine gun
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:00:38 aka death
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:01:14 lemme guess

garbage tank replacement
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:03:14 my F 15 just got killed by a 1 wide propeller plane

embarrasment
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:15:44 oh god
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:25:39 jesus
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 20:27:56 someone shot my engine off? no! bite mark!
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:06:12 yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:06:15 except very large
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:07:01 i have seen that exact b17 so many places
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:21:31 ik
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:21:43 "noo you cant just copy the plane that i copied"
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:25:51 not thick wings dies from cringe
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:29:18 btw the color absolutely ruins it
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:30:24 it looks like he doesnt know that you can use the RGB slide to get more colors than the ones shown
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:30:58 bobm
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:31:41 i should probably remove the engines that make the blue exhaust thats visible
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:32:27 yes i could
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:32:29 however
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:32:38 that would disqualify it for the engineer role
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:32:44 thats why im using rocket
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:33:37 
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:33:58 thats colors used by the USAF during ww2
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 21:34:20 N17's werent painted chrome i think
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:47:15 just had someone pull out a shredder when i killed his jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:47:26 then he called me a hacker when i killed his shredder too
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:49:11 a mix of skill and a good pvp jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:49:25 jets built for pvp tend to poutperfom tutorial jets in every way
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:49:34 
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:50:35 960 sps
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:51:12 i could make it faster but when will i ever need to fly 10 times the speed of light
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 09:51:37 pain
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 09:41:55 POV: you have a large slow moving plane in public pvp ane you have been alive for mnore than 0.0000012 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 09:59:34 ow
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:39:40 so i moved my stabilizers on my F15 1 block back because it looked more accurate 

it killed the perfomance
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:41:03 after change
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:41:25 before change
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:41:34 eh, which ones *looks* better..
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:42:09 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:42:14 i just dont have much space to work with
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:42:16 its a 1 wider
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:42:32 i mean i guess
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:44:21 ok what do i change
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:45:15 yeah but where the lock moitor is is where the motor for roll is
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:45:27 wair
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:45:32 no wait one sec
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:45:54 if i did i'd be unable to roll
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:45:59 which makes it very hard to fly
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:46:19 its a M2M btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:46:29 wait one sec
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:46:48 if i replace 2 blocks with 0.9's this might work..
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:47:05 gimme a moment
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:47:25 oh and a little exposed lock doesnt hurt, as long as it can be used to ruin the fun for everyone else in public pvp
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:48:26 this *should* work
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:49:05 it did, but it got stuck in some trails that i cant remove cause it'd make the plane fall apart
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:50:17 wait.. i actually do think i can delete them
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:50:39 RIGHT
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:52:13 <@697870811117387899> it fucked it up cause you cant attach stuff to the side of texts
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:52:42 https://tenor.com/view/cat-angry-feline-creature-gif-23361370
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:53:35 depends if u have a nasa pc like mine
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:54:08 *casually loads a 4.5k block ship in around 5 seconds*
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:54:43 i feel bad for you
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:55:28 the extra real life accuracy had a cost
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:55:40 my exhaust is now fucking ugly
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:55:58 BUT HOLY SHIT THIS THING TURNS FAST NOW
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:56:18 me when 1 wider
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:57:51 looks
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:57:52 uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:57:54 okay
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 21:58:31 also dont listen to people who say "wedge for nato pyramid for russian"

pyramid just looks better on anything
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:00:19 whenever people ask me why the intake isnt angled i just tell them its cause the afterburnder is on
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:00:25 (i hate custom angles)
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:00:49 they look good but they are PAINFUL
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:01:32 exposed landing gear 😈
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:02:00 well it worked when i use trails but not texyt
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:02:41 
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:03:05 they need to be attached here, on the side of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:03:09 sure

plane-crazy 2022-12-12 13:57:00 hm?
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 13:58:40 pulls a 98g turn in 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 13:59:11 shredder bug in wt when
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:53:44 bombs on a pvp jet cause why not
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:55:01 namnam planes use trapdoor wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:55:13 this one dont
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:56:27 why is it that as soon as a semi pupular ytuber makes a guide on a type of jet every single specimen of that jet type becomes a [insert ytuber] plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:57:06 i like ruining the fun for other public pvp players yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:57:17 that is that fighter yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:58:00 my guy

i built a plane

1 wider

then learned about namnam when people called it a namnam jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:58:50 i cant believe someone already made it into a speech bubble meme 💀
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:59:10 namnam planes have trap door wings tho this one doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:59:27 it doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:59:33 
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 17:59:51 where trapdoors on wing
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:00:59 besides if i was a namnam wannabe i wouldnt be using a pyramid nose cause "pYrAmId iS fOr RuSsIaN pLaNeS WedDgE fOr NatO"
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:01:59 if i make it into a wedge nose it looks even more namnam
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:02:37 issue is while ugly as hell namnams planes are suspeciously effective ._.
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:03:14 fair point
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:03:54 ngl the "hide the motor in the fusulage" is a good idea, didnt think of that
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:05:45 Man.

Can't even build 1 widers without being compared to a shitty youtuber.
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:06:05 cant have shit in ohio
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:06:44 but i like the F-15 😭
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:07:23 what do u want me to build the goofy angled rudder f15
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:07:40 trap dor wing nam nam copy!11
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:08:23 also heres my f15 compared to namnams
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:08:26 how are they even similar
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 18:08:30 (mine is worse)

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:12:24 
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:14:06 i will not be admit to be worse than this
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:14:07 i may be bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:14:10 but not this bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:14:26 im at least decent
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:17:00 He couldn't survive 12 tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:17:04 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:17:56 That's true, if they hit me my motorlock fucking implodes itself
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:17:59 But
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:18:02 Here's the thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:18:03 They wont
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:19:17 I'm the kind of guy who eats Doritos and sit on public pvp all day and give new players a very hard time
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:19:22 Basically I'm a piece of shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:19:56 I go on the PCC private servers every now and then but no one ever wants to dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:20:59 I love pulling a 80g turn in less than a second
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:21:10 I honestly agree
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:21:51 Now that's something instill haven't been able to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:22:31 Ok but to be fucken fair if i got behind a plane ready to shot and the bitch started fucking reversing towards me i would scream in fear
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:23:08 Yeah.. i probably should make myself a better perso. And just build bombers and airliners instead
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:25:01 I am not gonna step that low
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:25:28 I mean at least i used namnams guide as a.. y'know.. fucking guide
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:25:37 Instead of copying it as most people do
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:27:26 The ones that tend to be the pvp gods are the ones that  change materials for perfomance but don't color anything other than a black canopy

Those fucks are scary
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:29:29 I do also have a PE8 inspired bomber (it's legit just a PE8 except huge) but bringing it out in public pvp is basically suicide
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:30:15 Aren't they the same but different race
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:30:37 How you gonna replicate that tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:31:38 I would shit my pants, like cobra capable pvp planes are enough to make me nope the hell outta there
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:31:57 Like bro pull a cobra on me in pvp and I'ma just surrender in
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:32:16 What's ur average speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:33:02 BRO NAH

THATS ACTUALLY COOL THO
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:33:55 Demoman is that you
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:34:21 Then fuck off i wanted demoman
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:35:07 I have the motivation to learn how to make mechs just to build a giant TF2 heavy with a minigun
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:35:29 W
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:38:07 I wonder if plane crazy 2 will have larger plots
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:38:10 I hope
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:38:34 If I'm not able to make an accurately sized Yamato I'ma be disappointed
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:40:30 I made what's probably the closest to a accurate Knud Rasmussen class frigate I'll ever get and it was 5k
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:40:34 And it ain't even done yet
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:40:42 I can't make it float 😐
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:41:52 I remember wanting to make a roscale pe8
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:41:58 That shit was disappointing
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:42:01 Small as fucj
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:42:03 Like
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:42:14 No folds needed other than the wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:42:22 which is BOOORIIING
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:44:07 I do the same
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:44:33 I looked at how large my Pe8 would be if accurate and was like "nah lemme make it 3 times bigger"
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:45:48 If we get larger plots I'ma see if i can build a accurate fucking Chernobyl powerplant
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 20:45:54 With all 4 reactors
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:07:08 absolutely deleting another plane feels soo much better when its an actual fair fight and not just pvp 1 wider vs starter plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:08:21 like, i was getting close to a shot on some dude and then he pulls the cleanest cobra manuver ive ever seen
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:08:25 fight was fucking on
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:09:07 i did
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:09:15 he fucking dudged my rockets with that cobra
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:09:18 no clue how
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:10:03 im not gonna use guns while going mach 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:10:05 that is just
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:10:06 dumb
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:11:08 rockets are ass true, but that means it takes more skill to use them wich just makes kills using them feel so much better
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:13:24 either spin or just mount them on something fast
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:13:36 like, my rockets dont need any spin cause my plane is going mach 2 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:32 yuh
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:42 actually idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:14:47 cause like
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:03 i just count mach  as if sps were km/h
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:12 how much sps would you actually need for mach 1?
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:37 no cause thats how many km/h you need and sps is different
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:15:47 still different
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:16:39 theres another pvp fighter in my server, fights on
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:20:40 when you think you have the best pvp fighter and this mf flexes his supermaneuvrability
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:25:27 speaking of, look at my goofy ass eff fiftin fighter
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:21 i made this one myself but ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:30 i tried to
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:52 yeah and daddy namnam said trap door wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:26:58 i ignored both of those
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:27:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:28:36 they are, im considering replacing my current wings with trap doors for that exact reason, then again i dont want another reason to be called a namnam user
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:10 i like fighting thats the thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:25 sure roscalers are cool but

kill kill death murder kill
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:50 yeah but
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:29:51 i use m2m
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:30:00 i know
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:30:24 a m2m can roll
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:31:04 a good m2m has 2 motors for each stabilizer, one for the mouse control and once for roll
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:31:22 oh right i also have this piece of shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:34:13 its good for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:34:20 yes it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:34:31 so=

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:34:58 i wish i could make my plane turn SLOWER
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:35:43 bro thats some ace combat shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:36:24 
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:38:19 it looks cool tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 13:38:27 i wanna see 2 planes with that control system fight
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:35:31 so yall know those underground bunkers?
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:35:48 yeah i accidentally developped a bomb that can get to them
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:49:12 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:49:27 and i reverse engineered the mechanish used to make them and made a anti bunker bomb
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:51:23 this is the damage the bomb caused
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:54:20 just know if you build one
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 19:54:31 you are not safe

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 12:24:22 i need better mobility so i am replacing my f15's wings with trapdoor wings even tho i will indeed be called a namnam user even more
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 12:37:20 best plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 12:46:50 time for me to go thru the pain of having to completely redo the wing panels that keep my plane stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 12:47:05 i replaced the wings with trap door wings for better mobility so now it behaves weird

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:22:24 imagine if they add lock on missiles in plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:23:27 i wish there was a way to make at least manuly guided missiles on your yet while still having it look good
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:23:39 Instead of flying around with 2 missles same size as your jet
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:24:26 I can but they're ineffective asf
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:24:55 Besides, 1 block thic missiles still looks hella large
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:25:33 Like imagine a missile the size of a sparkler toob that was manually guided and actually did damage
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 23:13:27 guys
the-dump 2023-03-18 07:36:39 just posted this on some Andrew Tate video about the possibility of lung cancer, wish me luck with the replys
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:37:38 i see lots of people where the rfirst thing they do when making a new plane is making a lock tower

uh whats a good height for said motorlock tower to start off with
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:43:06 i got a feeling mig23 would be a good starting point for a semi-roscale build
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:43:17 just cause it doesnt rlt have any goofy angles
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:43:34 its straighter than me
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:08:11 i wonder if its possible to shove thust vectoring into a 1 wider
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:08:19 hold on i gotta test something
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:52:12 im proud of being the reason ur quitting pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:52:18 exceot my jet doesnt use guns
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:07:58 i made a over engineered starter plane cause thats totally original right
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:03:48 minor damage
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:32:37 The entire belly, exhaust nuzzles, and the nose is ripped off
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:54:35 Today i found out my f15 can fly with both wings cut off
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:55:34 i mean, it's a 1 wider, the main wings have no flaps cause of m2m, and they're mostly trap doors so those bits of delta wings don't do much
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 17:59:47 i mena it's what works
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:00:23 I'm experimenting with somehow shoving thrust vectors into a 1 wider
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:00:39 Those usually need to be in a 2 wider at least
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:01:18 Do tell
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:01:23 If u say WASD I'm killing you
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:01:34 kill self
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:01:54 i use m2m cause i wanna be able to actually aim
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:02:58 Aiming with WASD takes skill
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:03:07 I don't want to have ti be good at the game
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:03:16 Having to be good at building is enough
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 18:04:59 Currently struggling with attaching rudders to my plane lmao

plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:48:40 he then copied my camo design
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:48:45 im 2010 dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:49:35 i was mocking the namnam user!!
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:49:59 wasnt even denying it 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:51:04 i do normally but only if i have a reason to
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:51:11 i JUST turned it on cause of him
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:52:34 i mena i didnt know he was going to
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:52:56 nah but look at this, its a namnam copy with namnam bombs and guns even tho namnam said no guns
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:53:36 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:53:40 and he left
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:54:15 well yeha
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:54:38 it was just cause hes so bad he cant even copy it correctly
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:55:32 the voices are telling me to ping namnam
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:55:37 yeah its ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:56:16 fuck you! *Su27 camo on a MiG29*
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:56:36 nein
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:56:54 i get called a namnam user cause i use 1 widers tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:57:38 even tho i prefer wing panel wings over trap doors and i build in a slightly larger scale than namnam jets are
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 18:58:23 1 wider with trap door wing doesnt mean it s anamnam jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:00:24 namnam jets are jets that have a motorlock structure identical to the namnam jets, the nato jets have wedge noses even tho its ugly, uften the intakes arent even detailed and are just wedges and exposed propellers in the nose and on the wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:01:27 and my jets have actually detailed intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:01:51 and i've put effort into hiding the nose props
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:02:03 and no trap door wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:03:20 and also pyramid nose on NATO jets cause fuck wedge nose, all my homies hate wedge nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:03:35 ok ima stop spamming images
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:04:02 kewl
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:04:57 clearly a plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:06:00 we didnt?
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:06:16 2wide and 1wide pvp jets are both gud
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:07:11 severe case of exposed motorlock i just cant fucking fix
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:07:19 good thing its on the belly of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:07:32 any plane with decent speed and manuverbility is a bitch to kill
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:08:37 its a finished plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:08:39 and yes pvp
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:09:45 PCC members with expert role when someone prefers a different design than them (how dare they have preferences)
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:10:48 so what if they're ugly, they're made to kill
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:11:15 theres a reason i dont put it in creations cause i play this game to bully kids not to make good looking stuff
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:11:25 good for you, moving on
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:11:45 advice
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:11:53 sometimes i run into an issue when building so i ask halp
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:12:10 no, shit like wobble fix
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:12:32 yeha but tuts are for nubs!1
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:12:53 sometimes if i cant get angle lock to work i ask help
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:13:08 if theres some weight balancing i cant fix myself i ask help

plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:13:59 smart guy
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:14:16 YT help is ass cause its always "how to do this, if you ahve the exact fuckign plane i have"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:14:41 PCC halp is better cause you can say "this is my design, i need help with somethign"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:14:48 you can be far more specific here than on yt
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:15:50 thats justa  tad bit too late dont yout hink
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:16:07 ill prolly use horizontal when i regain motivation to make a new jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:16:38 i would cover it up with a droptank but its too far back
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:17:06 
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:18:11 well yeah but its an entire motor block not just a tip which is what pains me
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:18:54 cant lie my first jet was soo much better!11
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:20:31 ok im out of ideas what do i build next
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 19:21:04 i dont wanna build a modern russian plane cause thats too similar to the mig i just finished
