creations-chat 2019-02-20 16:38:25 My first complete build, I think . I want to make a tank using tracks next.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:29:48 I think an amazon drone equipped with a mini-gun would be a amazing sight.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:33:52 Rifle you say, maybe I'do both, oh and also can some one make a working revolver?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:35:13 Yea?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:36:18 Problem being I have'ent made either lol but Im still waiting for the actual gun to be made so yea...
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:38:47 Ya talking about this
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:40:17 [enter photo here of all guns combined]
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:41:56 Good luck
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:42:23 That looks pretty amazing though wonder how it'll turn out.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:43:12 Oh...
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:45:28 Hey um developers, Is it possible to have 1x1 in the game as a genric block?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:47:05 Hum sizing would be great how ever you know build you're own mech right?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:47:15 That game.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:55:10 What is the point of the blades them self being on a rotating object or is that something different?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:56:08 Oh I see I'll test that out.
creations-chat 2019-02-21 18:29:43 Got the mini-gun just missing the drone, Guess I could say 1/2 finished
