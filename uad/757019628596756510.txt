events-chat 2022-02-08 13:03:57 no way that's enough
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:04:16 they should've allowed like 8 bombs
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:04:42 u hit folds?
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:05:24 that is good but aircraft carrier is stable
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:05:41 it won't flip so easily
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:07:21 i've made a cargo ship that i didn't mean to make to be hard to sink but it just deosn't want to go down until u destroy it fully
not even when u destroy the fold
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:09:10 it's not it separates but parts don't sink
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:09:26 that is true
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:09:49 true
you can't really sink a ship until u destroy it fully
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:12:15 i've made one just to see if i can modify it to be more useful
btw how do you refill/respawn?
if it's allowed
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:12:48 and yea it has really bad steering
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:13:50 yep if you can't respawn then you can't refill the bombs. Bomber is just not worth it
