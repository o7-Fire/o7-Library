plane-crazy 2022-04-17 12:01:07 if you attach to magnets to opposite poles of a piston facing eachother and then make them strong, you can go thousands of speed. if you put on a parachute first then it glitches inside of this magnet concoction and sends you flying billions of speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 12:01:25 i have harnessed this to send people flying in pvp modes but its very hard to control
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 12:01:39 because your going thousands of times the speed of light

help 2022-05-01 19:19:20 im trying to make a hinge for turning my vehicle and im turning it in the middle but the hingle isnt strong enough, how can i strengthen this
help 2022-05-01 19:32:13 i have made a middle hinge but it goes side to side instead of turning the entire vehicle
help 2022-05-01 20:08:13 the reason its turning left is because of rotational force
help 2022-05-01 20:08:28 the rotors are spinning the whole build
help 2022-05-01 20:08:42 you could double up the rotors and make one spin the opposite way to counter this
