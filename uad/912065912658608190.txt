creations-chat 2023-04-29 00:54:52 yo what plane is that
creations-chat 2023-04-29 18:04:10 Omg exposed lock!!1!!1!!!!
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:40:54 I feel the nose could get an improvement
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:47:43 Lol
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:15:51 He got the stealth hornet
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:17:54 That was a goated tutorial for the time ngl
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:27:24 The nose on you plane looks too fat
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:29:28 I think they mean the sides are too sharp not the tip
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:32:30 Wdym like that
I feel like you should send some pics like a 3 view of your plane
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:37:00 Yea but if you still want it sharp then you can use that 2,3,4 block pyramid wedge method
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:40:34 The triangle wedge nose gets too wide and is inaccurate since the nose is round
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:48:25 I'm not sure about this but the external feul tanks look a bit big
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:50:28 The nose is more of a cylinder than a pyrimid
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:52:45 Ngl I don't think it really matters that 2-3 blocks but if you make the canopy 2 blocks then the nose should be 2 blocks
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:55:09 What blueprints are you using
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:58:22 From the front the nose is circle Not a diamond shape
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:03:24 Send some more pics of the front and top of your f 18
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:05:38 That’s why I’m asking to see the nose from the front and top
bot-central 2023-04-30 01:06:16 !rank
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:15:56 Do any of y’all got some ideas for a plane
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:22:07 It's looking good from the sides but can you send a picture of the front and top
bot-central 2023-04-30 01:22:42 !rank
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:47:03 I feel like the tanks are too wide or the shape just makes it look too wide
creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:30:12 Maybe better than 35% of players I feel
creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:32:15 Bro think he Jeff bezos
creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:35:40 I think if they used motor lock they're mom's phone will explode
creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:38:09 It looks good but why backwards
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:15:42 yo thanks for the advice ima add that rq. also ive seen ur x 303 (its custom right?) and i really like the design. i was wondering if i caould make an x 303 of my own (ill make it bigger and change some stuff up) ill make  sure not to copy
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:24:16 ok thanks man
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:27:01 should i finish this
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:35:57 i dont think i can because the engine is made out of a bunch of signs ( i only made this cuz i was boerd)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 16:52:06 maybe 1.5 or 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 19:16:49 Bro can't come up with new colors
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 19:18:57 At first glance I thought that was some train
creations-chat 2023-04-30 20:26:45 I feel like you should try to make it a little smoother if you can

plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:10:54 It's hard to guess a play by It's nose
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:14:13 yall think i should finish this f14 (ignore disconnectors)
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:15:20 why that image got such a background lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:40:45 i like to do this to get measurements
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:42:14 i just use how wide i want the fusalage to be
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:42:28 yea
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:42:35 thats what im using
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:46:46 is this your f 14 lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:49:07 lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:50:38 no scale
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:52:29 what

plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:53:37 dosent that happen when you immideatley lock the piston after extending it
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:53:50 you gotta wait 5-10 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:55:08 oh that
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:55:18 that mostly happens to me with motors
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:56:23 i just make the nose last
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:56:47 i either start from the middle or the end
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:57:56 i just feel noses are the hardest part so i do them lasr
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 19:58:44 i just use the fusalage as scale
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:01:06 what black man
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:04:11 you dont even need a reason to call the police
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:24:13 I got an f14 afterburner that are 1k blocks (I was a little boerd)
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:26:04

plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:29:58 Nah
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:31:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:32:00 There's probably an easier way with no motor lock at all
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:33:59 The top of the nose (not cockpit) feels a little off
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:34:36 Yea I geus
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:35:21 I think you should make the blueprint a little bigger

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:43:31 on/off engines?
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:44:22 use a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:45:11 yea but it works better with a litle space
creations-chat 2023-05-09 19:45:21 https://www.youtube.com/@TheMadVulpen
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:48:02 its pretty much impossible to stop instantly unless you use anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:48:58 why not use normal engines for that
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:56:50 you cant glide in pc
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:57:17 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/529858892075761694/945049341486325841

help 2023-05-10 00:27:56 add them back in deifferent directiond
creations-chat 2023-05-10 00:36:01 The intake looks nice, try to blend it better and probably RE do the nose
creations-chat 2023-05-10 00:40:23 the nose shoould be smaller and make the plane a little more round
creations-chat 2023-05-10 00:51:53 just wing panels
creations-chat 2023-05-10 00:54:02 make it this big and you may get in the hall of famehttps://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/787468084898168843
creations-chat 2023-05-10 19:42:10 how is the nose so far
creations-chat 2023-05-11 00:33:06 White screen?
creations-chat 2023-05-11 19:37:39 <@753767259096219749> ngl thats a nice missle.  all i wanna ask is what engine you used and how stable is it
creations-chat 2023-05-11 19:40:11 wsg
creations-chat 2023-05-11 19:48:36 humble pretty much means you dont take pride
creations-chat 2023-05-11 23:47:48 wings too big and i feel theres something with the cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 12:53:16 Probably start with a motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 12:54:31 Maybe put a tower in the middle or offset lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 12:54:52 Send a picture on what you've done so far
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 12:55:52 Are you doing this one
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 12:56:24 You could use delta wings on the nose
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:31:53 Whoever down voted will feel the wrath of the deathron 5 grillion
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 15:34:36 Add some more color it blends in with the ground
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 17:37:42 It looks good from top and sides but you should smoothen it out more
creations-chat 2023-05-13 02:38:06 I'd buy
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:38:13 Maybe use propellers
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:07 Yea like the small ones
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:30 Put some in the back and turn them on until it balances
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:36 Or add ballast to front
creations-chat 2023-05-13 14:37:24 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWO-tzSZAs   try something like this
creations-chat 2023-05-13 14:41:50 Maybe an f18 or f5
creations-chat 2023-05-13 15:03:06 I would say f 16 but you may have trouble with the intake. Maybe a su 30 or a mirage
creations-chat 2023-05-13 21:28:52 anyone have an idea on how to make the whindow more like this
creations-chat 2023-05-13 21:49:39 no thats my plane but i want to make that part not glass
creations-chat 2023-05-13 22:37:05 this is what its like default. i wanna get half of the half wedge down default and the other half glass
creations-chat 2023-05-13 22:39:06 im a whitename not a white namnam
creations-chat 2023-05-13 22:41:11 yea
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:28:56 You should make the fuselage rounder and re do the nose
creations-chat 2023-05-14 15:08:36 What do you plan to do for the wing how do you make it flap
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 16:18:38 This isn't mine and I forgot who's it is if I find their post amazing send it

creations-chat 2023-05-14 18:48:16 probably

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:02:07 i fell the back is fine but you should work on the front
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:11:43 if you want
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:11:52 maybe after re doin the cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:12:02 or editing it

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:56:18 Wip
creations-chat 2023-05-14 23:24:25 its basically just a tutorial
creations-chat 2023-05-14 23:26:43 at least the other guy was trying their best, this is just another mans plane
creations-chat 2023-05-14 23:31:48 turn up torque
creations-chat 2023-05-15 01:08:02 End off the cylinder thing witha half ball and maybe move the stabilizers a little garter from the middle
creations-chat 2023-05-15 01:30:35 Can you send where it is in creations
creations-chat 2023-05-15 01:36:39 heres the vidhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq89OvzjXYc&t=29s
creations-chat 2023-05-15 01:38:48 i feel the cone nose would go good on a mig 31
creations-chat 2023-05-15 16:02:07 Any thoughts on my f20 tigershark wings so far
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:16:53 It looks too bright
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:20:22 do whe motors wobble while spawning
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:24:24 did he get banned from pc or roblox
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:26:31 can you send photos
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:29:48 why all the best builders getting banned
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:34:35 yall think its worth finishing this
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:36:38 i was boerd
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:47:30 Should I make flanker fuselage 2 or 3 blocks wide
creations-chat 2023-05-15 21:20:00 I don't even know if it's possible
creations-chat 2023-05-15 23:07:44 Them intakes ruin the f 35
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:02:03 I'm curious how he got that custom map and if it's still possible to do
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:15:52 Do that sharp nose thing
And add tons of bombs
creations-chat 2023-05-16 11:47:44 That looks really nice. Sad you can't spawn it. Same thing happened to my tu95 its mad annoying
creations-chat 2023-05-16 12:17:15 That plane is so smooth. Ima try to make a plane with a nose like that
creations-chat 2023-05-16 13:42:39 You should get rid of motor lock at tips
Make the decals look cleaner
Use better colors, the ones you currently use creates a bigger heat signature than the afterburners
Make it a little longer it looks too short
Cover up all the exposed motor lock
The main problem with your f14 to me is that it looks way too messy
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:54:53 What's your opinion on this then
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:57:47 I think I've seen it fly
As agile as a bomber
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:35:30 What's the plane
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:42:30 Add bombs and nose stick thing
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:47:26 I will one up you
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:50:19 A little later
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:01:31 We shall dogfight in the skies, winner has the true mirage 5
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:03:36 It is the pilot not the plane
-top gun I think
What
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:09:07 Ngl suspension landing gear isn't worth it
Tilting gear is better for airlines
I don't want an exposed gravity coil on my planes
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:12:14 You should make that cylinder thing in the engine more of a triangle if you want

creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:33:17 Try to get rid of the gaps on the control surfaces
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:35:18 Keep them separate with motorlock instead of control surfaces
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:54:43 Just a little more motorlock
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:01:20 Make it ice
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:03:42 Are the flaps the ones near the fuselage or are they farther away
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:05:57 Are they the ones near the fuselage or farther away
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:53:27 Did you max the motor 2 torque
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:59:56 Does the ailerons and flappers move separately

creations-chat 2023-05-19 00:59:52 Yea I'ma try to I don't think there's really much
creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:02:36 Should I just do that half wedge engine or use a jet engine

creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:36:29 2 blocks wide 3 blocks tall i think
creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:38:35 the only thing is try to make this part smoother
creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:41:25 
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:49:21 I didn't know what else to do
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:51:37 The only thing about it is the tip it should be a sharper angle

creations-chat 2023-05-23 13:22:07 Is the tomcat the most popular plane in pc
creations-chat 2023-05-23 13:25:54 What's the most
creations-chat 2023-05-23 13:38:16 I think the su 35 should stay because of all the namnam tutorials
creations-chat 2023-05-23 13:40:24 I think the b17 should replace a10 cuz I barely see them and I've seen them more than b2s
creations-chat 2023-05-23 18:28:24 Anyone know what's the best su 34 in pc
creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:18:13 thats because the downvote doesnt work (probably because of that nsfw spam)
creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:20:17 it goes back to 3 for me
creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:22:49

creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:29:47 it dont work it stays at 3
creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:32:55 Thats probably cuz it's your post nobody else can downvote
creations-chat 2023-05-23 19:36:10 That's because it's your post we can't do it

creations-chat 2023-05-27 20:05:23 ok
creations-chat 2023-05-27 22:35:08 I think the wings are too big and maybe too much forward
creations-chat 2023-05-29 16:52:08 wing panels maybe
creations-chat 2023-05-29 18:24:33 
creations-chat 2023-05-30 19:13:31 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhfpti8Eus&t=147s do something like this
creations-chat 2023-05-30 22:13:04 That hurt my eyes
creations-chat 2023-05-31 11:54:17 Make it more transparent with a lighter orange
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:03:22 also make it shorter
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:05:37 how fast
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:08:04 thats really not that fast
try 0.01
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:10:25 <@773913961883369515> iy looks cool but is hard to see so try to make it brighter
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:13:29 i use this on a similar speed plane
image didnt work mb
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:15:44 
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:18:36 heres where i put it
creations-chat 2023-05-31 19:35:32 i think its the byfron update
that update wont let me go into roblox through the website anymore
creations-chat 2023-06-02 19:08:58 Yea make them a little shorter
Also probably do something else for the wingtip instead of pontoons
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:44:46 anyone here know how to get shaders after byfron update
creations-chat 2023-06-05 00:51:30 Yea that's a huge improvement
Doesn't look like the same build no more
creations-chat 2023-06-06 13:10:18 <@579494514595463168> are those old photos or do the shaders still work
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:11:18 How many text
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:11:56 I think that's why
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:12:03 Is it that ship
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:12:33 In the background
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:14:13 Rejoin or something
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:30:45 It's either PC or some robloc update
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:32:41 Yes
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:57:56 Ain't that themadvulpen
creations-chat 2023-06-07 11:47:51 I think instead of tutorials people should use really good guides
creations-chat 2023-06-07 11:49:57 Yo how you get that and is it possible with 2x2 cylonders
creations-chat 2023-06-07 13:12:34 Mig 29 how it so far
creations-chat 2023-06-07 20:58:06 Yea the nose is kinda too long
Also why is everyone making an f5 now
creations-chat 2023-06-07 22:27:09 Trash build
So much exposed lock( stop making the excuse it's a rail
creations-chat 2023-06-08 01:02:10 Make the nose sharper
general 2023-06-08 16:30:23 Ngl pcmgs are dying out
creations-chat 2023-06-08 19:37:14 hows my mig so far
creations-chat 2023-06-08 20:03:44 Lol
creations-chat 2023-06-08 20:28:58 lvl 3
creations-chat 2023-06-08 22:33:42 So far I used 2 but I don't really need those anymore
I plan to do a cylinder canopy which is the only problem
creations-chat 2023-06-08 22:36:55 <@450079852922404864> send better pictures of the top and front
creations-chat 2023-06-08 23:43:57 Ngl I sometimes also br doing that
creations-chat 2023-06-12 12:33:27 That looks so clean
creations-chat 2023-06-12 19:48:31 <@567763933952475157> probably the best f15 in pc so far
only question is what did it take to get this i wanna see if i got space to do something like that on my mig 29
creations-chat 2023-06-12 22:39:44 I did the tail thing and ditched it. The tomcat feels like a very quitable plane
creations-chat 2023-06-12 22:42:22 Didn't feel like making it any more
Also because of the lag it's already 1k blocks
creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:22:23 At least he didn't send all his shit builds like the gonador guy or whatever
creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:29:37 I'll be honest that's a bad plane (whatever it is) but I wanna see one of your builds real quick
creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:39:30 Sure unless you just started it
creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:44:54 Normal glass
creations-chat 2023-06-13 18:02:56 Bro fr censored themselves lol
creations-chat 2023-06-13 18:10:52 A little swearing hurt nobody
creations-chat 2023-06-13 19:07:10 <@1066662878024843306> try windows, shift, S, that screenshots for me
creations-chat 2023-06-15 20:27:03 <@803292176418078720>  Try fixing the cheese grater wings if you can, try to use custom landing gear, use trails instead of a rocket for the afterburner (unless it makes lots lag), either go for a cylinder canopy or don't use cylinders on the spine unless you can flush it out, try to hide the guns or motorlock them into cylinders or sparklers, try to make the cockpit 2 blocks and move the trails in the cockpit a little.

Overall it's a decent build but it needs to be smoothened out a little
creations-chat 2023-06-15 21:43:40 yea that looks pretty clean
creations-chat 2023-06-15 21:47:36 for demensions i put a blueprint on a grid to help 
i made it the same size as ur mug 27 dw
when forget to attach image
creations-chat 2023-06-15 21:49:51 <@803292176418078720>
creations-chat 2023-06-15 21:55:56 Camera lock pretty mid unless your making a 1 block plane
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:00:14 What plane
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:03:20 I'm thinking of a mirage or something but the nose doest fit that

Maybe a typhoon
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:07:44 Is that a real camo or just aero
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:09:48 Yea lol
Probably 50-50-50 for the color code I'm guessing
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:14:07 Ik but at that point just use normal motorlock 
Caprock is actual dogshit
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:30:39 At that point just use motorlock 
Camera lock is actual shit with barely any use
Pistons and motors work better
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:35:19 It doesn't really matter how long it takes to spawn unless there's some namnam copy or shredder in the server
Most of my builds are for looks anyways so I don't really need to spawn quickly
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:37:27 Locked motor
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:40:09 I'm talking about those guys with a 1 block wide su 27 filled with trapdoors
creations-chat 2023-06-15 22:48:47 I don't got nothing with trapdoors 
I don't use them because I usually use disconnections or just blocks. I'm just describing them namnam copy su 30s or whatever 
Something like this
creations-chat 2023-06-15 23:58:42 What
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:11:03 hows the wings
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:34:46 there
in tower
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:37:47 gass canopy
i will try to hide the motors there but dont expect an interior
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:41:15 i tied that but it looks weird
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:45:52 Something like that would look better on a f16 instead of a mig 29
creations-chat 2023-06-16 16:25:11 the mig im making is pretty big
creations-chat 2023-06-16 18:22:50 you need lvl 3 to post image
creations-chat 2023-06-18 15:58:12 It's alright, idk why you used blocks for the vstab instead of wing panels
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:52:48 Yall got any thoughts so far on my su 27UB
creations-chat 2023-06-19 17:01:45 do you got a camo or something you reccomend i do
creations-chat 2023-06-19 17:57:29 are the proportions right so far
creations-chat 2023-06-19 17:59:44 nah nrn
creations-chat 2023-06-19 18:01:55 what
how wide do you want it
creations-chat 2023-06-19 18:03:59 that sucks, delete it
creations-chat 2023-06-19 19:48:59 Nah
creations-chat 2023-06-21 03:06:45 Most normal camera lock main
creations-chat 2023-06-21 13:21:18 Do you even use angle lock?
nvm he left lol
creations-chat 2023-06-26 20:35:39 Talk until level 3
creations-chat 2023-06-27 16:38:15 its alright. try to hide those guns
creations-chat 2023-06-27 16:40:28 get rid of this gap
creations-chat 2023-06-29 19:56:44 Not just him there are lots of copy scripts going around now
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:33:17 go to dms?
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:39:09 man we just here to play pc. if anyone wants to find that game let them descover themselves, or give a simple recommendation. you dont need to defend your game to a server of people who dont even care. A better way to reccomend that game is by one or 2 messages and reply if people react. you dont need to be so serious about that.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:43:04 why tho
doing  this shit doesnt benefit you at all
what do you get by doing this, a new player
just stop preaching the game, at this point its not about the game anymore and its just a useless argument
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:49:25 i dont know anything about EE but i feel its nothing like pc
comparing that is like comparing apple to oranges
this server is about plane crazy and maybe a tad bit of flightpoint but thats pretty much it
you should reccomend you game to the server of another game similar to it
then you have 2 valid things to compare
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:53:52 it aint even the same game
people joining pc most likely like it simple, as they progess and they start to gt more advanced, they may  join that game you want
for now the best thing you got is roblox adds
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:59:56 apparently thats shit to him
i dont think he understands that different games got different standards, different styles and diffrent types of players
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:26:43 how is it madvulpen
creations-chat 2023-06-30 01:00:15 Looks alright, maybe the fuselage is a little to square <@924060821670223912>
creations-chat 2023-06-30 02:00:37 motorlock them into a block
creations-chat 2023-06-30 02:02:46 yea do that you can still fold it
creations-chat 2023-07-02 02:58:50 Ngl I recommend delta control surfaces
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:04:33 nice looking, maybe add some shrubs or stuff because it looks empty, unless you want it that way
(add me)
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:46:05 why do you need to know
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:51:56 why
do you always start a conversation by asking pronouns
creations-chat 2023-07-03 01:07:55 First get rid of those triangles sticking out of the engine, maybe move the cockpit back a little and re do the nose
bot-central 2023-07-05 17:49:38 !rank
bot-central 2023-07-05 17:49:49 -servers
creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:55:31 i think the conveyors lag
creations-chat 2023-07-08 22:39:11 Can you send the blueprints
creations-chat 2023-07-08 22:42:01 Dms
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:51:43 What plane?
creations-chat 2023-07-10 03:03:58 Which 2 should I do
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:54:05 Just spam a bunch of blocks to the corner of the plot to move it there
Or go first person
creations-chat 2023-07-12 21:24:10 Which one
creations-chat 2023-07-12 21:31:22 The only ones I'm really in are pcmgs
They either ok or really toxic
creations-chat 2023-07-13 23:55:38 do some angle lock on the tail
creations-chat 2023-07-14 13:57:40 Depends but I'm guessing the fuselage would be 8-12 blocks tall
creations-chat 2023-07-14 14:00:00 I thought they ment something like an ac130 lol
