creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:10:53 I wish some of you "elite" builder could respect the finer things in life, not every build will be super detailed, not every builder has all day to practice, some of us have lives to live, some of use are not the BEST builders. Maybe just think about much they sat there, and thought "How could i make this work?" or "This doesnt look right, but this does!" we all struggle sometimes. You guys started out just like the rest of us, build shi**y builds that you thought where cool
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:15:02 Thanks, godly. I worked my ass off trying to figure out steering for the Albatros
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:19:33 A lot of these people who down vote simple builds are people who don't understand or don't remember how they started out, they are kids who sit in their room the entire day just building away, and every once in awhile sticking their hands in a bag to grab a few Cheetos, sip some rock star energy, and get back to "work". They just become oblivious that there are people with feelings that have jobs, school, family issues, etc
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:22:44 Still, just because you started out with excellent building techniques doesn't mean you can learn to respect those who aren't born a natural, some of us just don't automatically start walking out of the womb, some of use need to crawl first.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:25:03 Im not upset over a lousy downvote, its just i feel like things just start to get fuzzy as you get better
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:27:18 You think i havent taken this criticism? You think this is a first? Ive tried, and tried, and tried, ive used info as i went along, trying to get better, its so hard
