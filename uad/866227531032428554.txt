help 2022-07-03 03:34:25 motorlock 20-30 hover thrusters with max drag make them face all directions, and it is happening because of speed and you using  real wingpanels for rotors, the easiest fix is using propellors to make it roll to left, it cannot be completely stable but more stable then the earlier ones, the hover thruster drag does help in reducing drag roll due to rotors but they make accelerating to higher speeds a little long 
+ another fix would be to add 30-40 control surface 1x1 in both vertical and horizontal orientation your heli would become mouse controlled and would need less propellors to counteract the torque caused by rotor-wind interaction
help 2022-07-03 04:36:07 thats the upper limit it can be changed according to your convinience if your build becomes stable with 15-20 you can go with it <@456226577798135808> for control surfaces however a higher number would be much better perhaps a combination of both hover and control

help 2022-07-03 04:38:34 otherwise the back heavy effect kicks in
help 2022-07-03 04:42:19 you can counter it with ballast blocks but it won't help stablaise your heli when moving as rotor-wind roll torque on heli increases quite high

help 2022-07-04 14:08:23 <@682627773197844586> these are the two types of rotor systems I found the most stable the first rotor has wing panels motor 2 with servo on I'd recommend using motor with power-lock settings if motor 2 glitches for you, the second rotor has hover engine, propellor blade, and control surface you can change the position or number of control surfaces with propellor blades as per your adjustment hover has maximum drag for helping in overall stabalisation of hover of heli

creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:24:45 the nose is very short and canopy looks quite small compared to nose on a rela one
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:21:21 I am no expert on making planes, but this looks like it will need some angle-locking for the nose and canopy canopy would be much smaller than the nose over all the plane nose would start as 1 block externd to 2 block(1/2 block on either side) then further spread out into 6 blocks wide which would overall need very much motor lock to get the perfect shape 

you can however cut some stuff out for ease
help 2022-07-08 19:42:47 your heli looks like the rotors are run by motors so you'd need another rotor on top of it like the kamov attack helis have dual rotor system a

help 2022-07-08 19:43:54 make sure to hide them
help 2022-07-08 20:04:41 that would involve changing the propulsion system of your heli, it would no longer need torque from motor to turn, i.e. use proper engine or glitch engine to turn the rotor
help 2022-07-08 20:05:09 the motor would however be used to for a rotating hinge for rotors
help 2022-07-08 20:05:21 it would be unpowered(the motor)

creations-chat 2022-08-02 15:04:23 In a nutshell,
pre 1979 Iran was a USA puppet monarchy, then rebels overturned the regime to another form of autocratic islamic government,
By then they had recieved the F14 and F5
If they had waited a while more before overthrowing the monarch they'd have gotten f16 and f18 too.
