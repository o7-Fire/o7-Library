plane-crazy 2023-01-19 20:11:23 should i buy the motorlock tower in the front, middle or back of the aircraft?

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:25:07 but, it's not correct

creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:24:26 yes i do, so... what's the problem in being a bad builder MR. pro player??
creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:28:07 the worst mistake i ever done in pc discord was asking for everyone's opinion about my builds
creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:30:11 everytime i ask what is wrong with my build, i get no real answer, the only crap i get is harrassment, this community does not appreciate any newbie effort

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:20:21 i'm not an expert with motorlock, so i can't give it too many details
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:20:57 my first attemp to build f-22 ended like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:21:54 yea, the back is kinda shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:22:46 ye
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:23:07 i used the motors to give a more round shape, but ended like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:24:41 this is the unlocked body
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:27:03 alr, i'll do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:41:53 i used a 3d model to build it, but ty
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:02 just adjust some angles and i'll get closer to the bp
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:28 or there is too much difference?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:27:03 alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:28:22 like a 2 block space ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:48 like this, or more

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:44 the anlge is a bit miss placed
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:51 gotta move it a lil back
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:10 should i do this part of the wing with 1x2 or 1x1 deltas?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:34 and i don't know how to angle lock wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:37 su-35
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:47 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:12 aight
creations-chat 2023-01-27 15:01:28 should i do this part of the wing of the su-35 with 1x2 or 1x1 deltas ? (i don't know basically anything about  angle locked wings)
creations-chat 2023-01-27 15:07:56 idk how to open the damn overlay on the app my pc has
creations-chat 2023-01-27 15:23:14 now i'm sure i built the wing correctly
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:08:35 is the lenght of this su-35 accurate?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:08:44 or should i make the nose shorter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:08:59 alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:09:11 
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:10:02 alr, so the nose and the back are out of proportion

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:54:48 the plane is basically split in half
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:55:23 it's horizontal bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:55:29 i wanted to try something new
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:56:01 also placing the angle locked back with vertical is a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:56:13 for me, at least
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:56:48 negative
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:56:57 i'm not willing to spend money on this game
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:57:18 it's true that i spent robux in a game i don't even play anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 23:57:51 how much blocks further ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:02:10 good question
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:02:22 i just wanted to try horizontal locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:02:38 at least it locks all togheter correctly
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:03:53 worst change in pc history
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:04:26 bro has the best pfp i ever seen

plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:13:05 at least not terrible
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:13:21 i tried, didn't end that good
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:13:44 probably just skill issue but, who cares <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:16:26 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:16:42 but who cares about the unlocked visual
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:17:12 i'm not gonna use it on pvp mode anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:18:32 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:18:34 brooo

plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:19:46 alr, time to make it longer
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:21:33 i guess the plane isn't too short, just too tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:39:51 rate this unfinished su-35 from 0-10
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:41:20 
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:50:20 be honest, is this su-35 bad?
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:50:35 i still have some details to add, painting to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:50:42 what makes it bad?

plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:52:02 what is it then bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:52:22 do you have a su-35 built?
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:52:51 i just want to compare
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:53:02 to see what i can improve on mine
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:54:40 don't worry bro, i'm used to hear elitist critics
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:55:36 and i try to see them as constructive critics
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:55:56 it's true that 99% of the advanced builders are trashtalkers but
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 00:59:14 i tried using motorlocked wing panels, but i couldn't make it look good (skill issue)
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 01:03:40 i knew the plane was too short
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 01:03:44 god damn

creations-chat 2023-03-01 20:32:07 i use them to hide the cheese graters, and it's easier for me, i know how to do motorlocked wings, but it's not practical for me
creations-chat 2023-03-01 20:39:10 the afterburners got fat due to a modification i had to do
creations-chat 2023-03-01 20:41:37 too long right

creations-chat 2023-04-21 23:23:43 oh yeah, much better
creations-chat 2023-04-21 23:29:48 nope, it's not an IRL plane, just making a prototype
creations-chat 2023-04-21 23:56:36 added a canopy angle 🙂
creations-chat 2023-04-22 00:01:16 i'm not building any real plane
creations-chat 2023-04-22 00:05:42 i'll try to make it look cool, not sure how yet
creations-chat 2023-04-22 00:50:55 working on that rn
creations-chat 2023-04-22 00:55:38 alr i managed to make a custom angle for the spine

plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:04:58 dam
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:05:33 it's quite weird to receive positive feedback here <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:05:42 won't complain
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:06:03 do as you wish lad
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:06:10 i'm used to that
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:06:55 people say springs are way too glitchy
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:07:10 could use disconnectors instead
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:07:24 BUT
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:08:31 if possible, place em like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:09:05 never like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:09:37 how to freecam?
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:11:09 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:11:43 it's quite hard to have build something compatible
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:11:52 dayum
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:11:58 i'm not in that level yet
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:13:41 before learning custom angles my builds were like this crap
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:14:25 the thingy might get stuck inside the build, even with helium blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:14:47 ya, imagine if the disconnector waste had physics
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:14:57 it would ruin everything
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:15:43 but oh boy, the amount of trash feedback recieved for that, you have no idea
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:16:49 they acted like they were going to crucify me after that
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:17:35 i really tought about giving up the game like, 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 01:19:33
