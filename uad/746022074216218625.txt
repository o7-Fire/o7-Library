creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:01:41 that wasn't exactly my intent but okay
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:03:24 no one has it

they either deleted it or it broke
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:06:37 then it just broke
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:16:26 thats epic

just finish the arms and stuff though

creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:19:44 for a weird looking plane, i would say you did well
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 21:21:00 Add pontoon or use helium to balance
Thicken it or make it shorter instead of tall
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:33:46 it isn't?

screw this slowmode >_>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:35:18 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:52:45 no pistons, the mondo spider is already fine

also the rope is stable because of thrust from the front plane
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:56:21 lol you're suffering from slowmode

creations-chat 2020-12-08 20:33:28 very epic power rangers wheelchair
creations-chat 2020-12-10 13:56:25 Lol it is exactly the same, but you screwed up on the motorlocking for the propeller

The control surfaces look different actually
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:00:31 its fine to make tutorials as long as you learn from it
creations-chat 2020-12-14 12:59:54 <@!570182286029357058> you didnt provide an image

wait what
creations-chat 2020-12-14 22:56:58 <@!564663966509563914> the gondolas look strange, thicken axis iron cross symbol, give the thing a shape similar to an ellipsoid, fix front, put the guns to the sides

isn't that hard to make zeppelin fronts, i've made them before
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:01:10 <@!665408211582582795> make barrel longer and don't make it so thick using sparklers i guess

also add a bit more detail like engine ventilation
shorten the **FRONT MACHINE** gun
and use text instead of half wedges

you have perfectly enough space for 100 size text
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:03:57 
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:07:31 
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:11:03 As a replacement for the numbers on the side on NinjaBlue's Tiger 1 131

Or rather to show him what text looks like instead of half wedges
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:05:54 too blocky
unrealistic when it comes to the size of the rocket and the satellite
solar panel placement is strange
