help 2020-04-18 02:03:58 Do cutters work better when they are spinning? I need to know because I am making a plane that uses a spinning cutter to ram bombers
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:22:20 Don't you hate it when you're just building something and someone accuses you of copying even though you did not copy off anything?
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 01:00:53 it would be so cool if joystick controls were implemented in Roblox
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 01:01:08 I hate flying with keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 01:02:15 I just find it really hard to aim with them
