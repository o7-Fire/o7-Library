creations-chat 2020-07-18 14:18:07 cool i can't send the video without it making a whole new creation

creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:19:18 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:29:58 What kind of angle? Top down? Side? <@456226577798135808> <@!688416918872260617>
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:32:09 Left side
They are custom flaps? They even slow the craft down as intended
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:35:23 <@!705822048781598821> It can go 350 horizontal. Flaps on it goes to 225-ish after slowing with them on
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:40:05 Because that's what they do irl according to one of my friends
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:43:41 Wikipedia, and images off of my phone

<@!422347528688762880> in my experience in flying games flaps slow the craft down, so I use them for accurate strafes

Why tf is there a slowmode that's so long?
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:46:15 Lmao makes sense, wanna just move to <#384021699466756107> then?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:05 <@!422347528688762880> In this small scale Milsim game I play, when you unlock the A-10 (only plane/jet in the game) you can press H to lower your airspeed by about 25-ish percent
I use it when dive bombing enemy compounds
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:11 Trust him
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:15 You can trust the man
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:23 He is a man with good intent
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:54 I can show you one of mine
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:48:58 What era?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:49:12 PvP or PvE?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:49:15 Dude yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:49:30 Can't help then sorry :/
I make PvP battleships
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:49:44 Same bro same
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:50:20 I made it like last year
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:50:27 So it looks understandably shit
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:50:38 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:51:21 I did say it was shit <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:51:42 wtf why do they reduce airspeed in game
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:53:27 I have shit tonnes of control surfaces in this. That's why it rolls so realistically
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:53:51 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:53:54 The wings?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:54:18 Yea it's only like 2 hours work
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:54:24 Crammed in with online schooling
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:54:38 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:54:49 Use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:55:39 dw
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:55:47 Motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:55:54 Motor 1 allows full 360 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:56:02 Motor 2 allows a set degree turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:56:23 M2 basically allows you to turn sometihng, say 90 degrees and toggle that
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:56:51 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:56:58 No settings allows for mouse control?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:57:12 HOLY SHIT TIME TO EXPERIMENT
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:57:36 I could edit my Typhoon MG with that
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:57:44 So
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 10:57:59 If I set max turning degree to like 30 it won't turn beyond 30 degrees?
