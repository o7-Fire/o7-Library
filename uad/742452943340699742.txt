bug-reports 2021-03-03 15:43:13 ok
bug-reports 2021-03-03 15:43:43 lol ok
bug-reports 2021-09-12 01:21:23 when stacking 6 max torque and speed motors on eachother it freaks out (sometimes happens on 5 motors too)
bot-central 2021-10-24 06:49:02 ?rhelp
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:27:02 When i launch i get teleported to the void???
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:27:07 I have a video
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:27:11 As proof
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:30:06 Only happens when i have a camera on my creation
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:30:38 Also the motors on my build start tilting
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:31:03 (when i have cameras)
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:34:10 Now my seat sticks to my creation even though there is nothing to stick to???
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:35:08 Now when i remove the cameras everything works as intended
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:36:42 Are the tilting motors a part of it?

bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:38:30 My motors aren't set to lock (if that makes a difference)
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:42 I just have normal motors with the speed and torque up to max
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 19:29:57 Qustion : do different materials have different stats?
