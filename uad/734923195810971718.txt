creations-chat 2021-01-23 22:38:19 ok ill add the mountians next in the back near the sun
creations-chat 2021-01-23 22:41:01 oh i can always change the light of the build for the gird
creations-chat 2021-01-23 22:51:41 should the mountians be behind the palm trees? Or should the mountians be at the back near the sun on the right of it and the left of it?
creations-chat 2021-01-23 22:56:54 this is what it looks like in build mode some of the cameras near the sun are missing its because i was thinking there but ill put them back and put the mountians on the side but do i need to move the palm trees?
creations-chat 2021-01-23 23:50:19 thankyou i was eating dinner so im back now
creations-chat 2021-01-23 23:52:51 motor lock if you scroll up a little you can see what i used. And for the grid i used the trial block at first i wanted small squares but i ran out of trial blocks so i had to make them bigger
creations-chat 2021-01-23 23:57:09 but should i add mountians behind the palm trees or should i add them to the left of the sun and to the right of the sun?
creations-chat 2021-01-23 23:59:53 <@!422347528688762880> <@!628523381209169930>  thankyou. And ill add the gap another friend told me to do that as well

creations-chat 2021-01-24 00:48:37 but if i post this then it might be spam because i already posted the one before the mountians. And do you like the different colors of shades on top of the mountians?

plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:54:00 i wish the tracks actually had a loops and so you wouldn't have to go to the airport
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:55:06 you know i thought about a train making its own tracks but rlly almost sorta complicated
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:55:48 ik
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:31 you know maybe I could use this for a type of curved track if I tried to turn it into one
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:04:32 you know what would be nice if they actually added the train track but as a block in plane crazy because its not just a block it has a different design
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:05:19 not the same
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:05:57 look on the inner part of the track
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:06:31 here look
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:07:40 sorta like a 1x0.9 but on both sides

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:45:44 to see if it gets in or not
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:45:57 but it says it in the rank request
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:46:23 hall-of-fame submissions can be submitted by DMing a server admin or mod. You do not need to use this system to submit hall-of-fame entries.

bug-reports 2023-07-12 01:29:50 I was playing with my friend today in a vc and I noticed that his plane wings were thicker then usual as you can see I placed my wing next to his. But when he shared which is the second picture I will post his screen it showed that the wings were normal. Don't know if anyone else has noticed this but if not hopefully youll be able to fix it. Best in regards, Wolf20
