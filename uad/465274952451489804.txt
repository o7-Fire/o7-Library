plane-crazy 2020-11-18 20:34:13 Something I made in my spare time, idk what it is honestly. Looks like something between a WWII Tank and a battleship.

or questions
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:41:29 yeah I tried something more larger with the tracks but it looked worse than the current version, im not that good when it comes to decor
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:49:13 any way I can improve this?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:51:09 Tank tracks are difficult to make so I just usually use conveyors for a simplistic look
