creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:24:42 is it just me being dumb or has anyone else realised that explosive block locking works in PVP without blowing your creation up

creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:02:39 > so you broke rules twice with one image
pog
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:12:39 Not really, <@456226577798135808> , could use a runway tho
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:13:16 > Not really, <@456226577798135808> , could use a runway tho
Welll..... Not in that sense
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:13:25 you said it was a carrier?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:14:02 If it was a VTOL aircraft carrier a runway would be neccessary, or a catapult
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:15:23 Sure, but a catapult may be more space efficient. Or, if you really wanted a runway, you could flatten the top, and put a hangar lift from the hangar onto it
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:15:41 but it's your choice, Really cool so far Nick!
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:04:37 tried it, became a submarine.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:32:52 yep. I mean now I don't really care about it too much its like 2 years old.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:34:34 I have a more recent ship that's better and that i'll post like tomorrow.
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 07:07:09 Is anyone else having issues where if a wing panel set is attached to an aircraft and then dropped with a disconnector connected to an explosive block (e.g missiles), when the explosives are detonated, the aircraft loses control?
