bug-reports 2022-08-02 10:18:04 i said "to mimic" i dont have gravity slider nor did i use it, its just all of my builds that were once perfectly balanced are now lighter
bug-reports 2022-08-02 10:20:51 helium got stronger
bug-reports 2022-08-02 11:11:59 just checked and helium still has the same power
bug-reports 2022-08-02 11:12:09 maybe its not helium but some blocks that got lighter

bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:19:52 do you try to unanchor right after you spawn?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:24:01 cuz depending on the size of your build and your pc's specs u might need to wait a couple of seconds before updates get registered
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:10 does it have a motor2?

bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:17 happened to me earlier too
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:41 then when i re select the move tool the thing just vanished

bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:50:18 thats exactly what was happening to me earlier
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:53:32 it either does that, go to the center of the map, or just vanish
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:56:35 figured out a way to replicate the error 69 bug
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:57:06 if u place something ontop of the invisible hitbox of a magnet then you are guaranteed to get the error(atleast from my testing)
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:57:17 tested it 4 times just to be sure
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:58:14 o
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:58:38 its as if it does that when u try to place on things that arent normal blocks
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:59:06 or not real blocks
