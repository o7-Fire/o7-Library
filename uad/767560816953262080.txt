help 2021-07-06 01:33:52 https://youtu.be/mHc7yHZ60iY: can someone help me with my mig? I already adjust the angle for the on command motor lock, then I pressed the button to release the disconnectors, but the angle ends up being straight and not the one I made ( I used youtube because streamable wont work for some reason) ( sorry for the crappy video quality I was in a rush so i used roblox recorder)

general 2022-04-15 12:27:36 "Yea and I also want  to make specific guides and step by step tutorials on shredder bugs because people with actual building skills are NERDS"
general 2022-04-15 12:29:35 Exactly. You don't start a youtube career just because you want to gain subscribers and have a certain role in a certain community of a game
general 2022-04-15 12:30:01 ikr!!11!1!
general 2022-04-15 12:31:32 if the game is good but the community is stinky doodoofard then I don't think anyone would want to be part of that community
