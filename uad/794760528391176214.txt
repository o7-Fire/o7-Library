The Tale of 737Max5 (794760528391176214)
help 2022-06-30 08:06:35 any one know how to stop my tomcat from exploding ish, it also spins if I lock the wings so they cant swing, it uses motor 2s so I think that might be the problem
help 2022-06-30 08:52:41 what do you mean by that? ive been playing for like 1.5 years now and I only know how to make stuff look cool, i have no idea how to make stuff fly
help 2022-06-30 08:58:16 now that I look at it more, i can kinda see how the wings and tail are too small and the stabilizers are too big and how the nose is too long but I dont think that would have an effect on the way it flys or having the wings glitch
help 2022-07-01 10:15:16 so I aksed help on this before and i got nowhere with it so ima ask again, my plane keeps glitching as seen in the vid, and i think thats becuase of the motor 2s for the swing wing, If i put a block next to teh motor and stop it or delete it , the plane with just start spinning and wont stop, even after pressing the flip button
help 2022-07-01 10:29:13 it was someone else
help 2022-07-01 10:29:29 ohhh my bad
help 2022-07-01 10:29:38 i read it wrong
help 2022-07-01 10:29:42 where?
help 2022-07-01 10:32:12 i will lock it to the motor lock so it doesnt move and that helps but then the plane just spins
help 2022-07-01 10:32:21 and it doesnt stop spinning
help 2022-07-01 10:34:28 it may be nose heavy

help 2022-07-03 06:35:09 so ive asked for help on this topic before and one response wasnt helpful and the other was very helpful, this is sort of related to my other questions but my plane sometimes starts spinning for no reason and doesnt stop, ive tried adding helium blocks to the front stop it from being nose heavy but adding more didnt do anything
help 2022-07-03 07:42:31 thx ill try change the second one since the motor lock is all centered and it spins left and right
help 2022-07-03 07:53:32 i found that the stabilizer/elavator was clipped by a half wedge from wedges, so far it works fine, thx for ur help
bug-reports 2022-07-03 08:43:47 for some reason when I stop flying my build, it doesnt teleport me back to my plot like it used too, my build goes back and I have to manually reset and its kinda annoying

help 2022-07-03 19:00:47 anyone know how to make big motor locked builds be less lagy so they can go faster, my tomcat is really slow at 8/10 graphics , at 4/10 its really fast but the map doesnt load in unless your right next to it, also this might be impossible since im running off the rusty old 1980s chevy of computers
