The Tale of insultifying (529128519259652108)
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:27:14 half blocks, half block wedges, etc, hitboxes should actually take up half of a block. not a full one.
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:27:52 i was trying to build a car and physically can not because of the hitboxes being so fucked.
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:29:29 i dont think you understand, i cant BUILD it at all because of this. driving it isnt the problem because i couldnt even make it past building the hood of the car to drive it. so i cant use motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:30:56 cant. the design of the car is too compact. theres no room to make one
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:31:52 the part i need it in is yes.
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:32:24 im trying to make a car thats small and compact, as to make it harder for toxic shredders to clap my ass
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:32:46 i dont enjoy planes.
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:32:59 tank treads are too tedious for me
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:34:26 n o
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:02 i see so many kids just slamming a motor with cutters on it to a box with wheels and just clappin dudes
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:53 i wanted like an offroader with a mounted gun
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 07:56:15 ight so im a very amateur player, and just now had a brain blast and figured out i can use pistons as suspensions, and it changed the way i build cars. like honestly its more compact, lets you increase speed without decreasing turn stability, and is soooo much better than normal suspensions for on-roading.
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 08:00:38 nope
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 08:02:21 i forgot thats my status
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 08:02:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 08:04:41 fixed the pfp

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 06:21:08 yo how do i make turning better with suspensions?
(im a total amateur)
general 2021-04-27 06:23:29 yo how do i make turning better with suspensions?
(im a total amateur)
general 2021-04-27 06:24:12 I'm aware, but I dont exactly have any option to not use them for this build.
general 2021-04-27 06:25:36 area im working with is 5 wide by 10 long
general 2021-04-27 06:26:16 nah the wheels are a block to the side of the suspension
general 2021-04-27 06:27:08 i sent u a screenshot of what im working with
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:39:11 yo can someone help me make a wobble bar on my chassis? I'm making my first attempt at a double wishbone and the steering is so damn unstable
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 19:51:12 I'm taking my first shot at a double wishbone suspension (prob butchered the fuck out of it lol) and the steering (which is powered by 2 servo motors) wobbles the whole damn car to the point where its unusable. anyone know how to stabalize it?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:22:51 Would anybody mind helping me build a dependent suspension system? maybe 6, 7, or 8 blocks wide?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:23:57 I'm probably wording this wrong but theres obv independent where one wheel has its own suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:24:16 and then theres depenedent where the 2 wheels are effected by eachother
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:27:20 Well I wanted to have it be dependent because I had a plan to build a muscle car
help 2021-06-29 00:14:04 I have this chassis here and I want to put a dune buggy body on top of it, but I can't seem to get a design that looks right. any ideas?
help 2021-06-29 07:21:24 So I finished my dune buggy but whenever I turn the back wheels spas out and bounce up and down. any way to fix this?
help 2021-06-29 07:21:28 
help 2021-06-29 07:22:55 
help 2021-06-29 07:41:13 I could, but I might fuck it up. im horrible at bodies.
help 2021-06-29 13:37:37 update: I pretty much fixed the steering issue by just adding counterweight
help 2021-07-14 20:23:31 I'm making a muscle car and its using steering that works with ONE servo. Any way to stabalize it?
help 2021-07-14 20:24:37 The steering is wobbling back and forth
general 2021-07-15 00:42:36 there should be save codes so you can send them to ur friends to share ur builds
general 2021-07-15 00:42:58 it would also make data recovery infinitely easier
creations-chat 2021-07-15 18:53:08 <@!531042200017174539> dude the jeep is too fuckin cool also what suspension is it packin
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:29:32 yes. its my favorite car. unfortunately, there are no quarter blocks, and i was making it to scale with a robloxian. and on top of that, the empty space thats missing from a half block counts as the hitbox when building so i cant be percise.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:33:14 #1. I'm not good enough with motor locking to make it very compact. #2. it probably wouldnt have left enough room for the solid axel suspension AND the "interior"
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:35:35 With all-do respect, jeeps are all about offroading, so a suspension is crucial. and is THAT jeep to scale with a robloxian? (i.e the robloxian looks like a human would next to the car?)
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:37:50 closer to a monster truck, but closer than that one probably.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:40:56 eh, it happens. ive made better anyway. like this muscle car.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:47:23 bruh its to scale WITH A ROBLOXIAN and the basic block is half of a robloxian. how much detail can i put in? there are no blocks really small enough for that level of detail
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:54:23 not while leaving room for the solid axel suspension and seating area. also im not good enough at it.
help 2021-09-25 14:50:07 hey I'm using piston damps on my dependent suspension, but when i start driving the car it spasms. any way to fix this?
help 2021-09-25 14:51:55 https://streamable.com/bt4dnv
help 2021-09-25 14:52:21 I know it needs body work, but its mainly a test for the suspension
help 2021-09-25 14:52:55 what do i use then?
help 2021-09-25 14:53:14 I need more clearance because the suspension peeks into the front of the wheel
help 2021-09-25 14:54:06 so half pistons give that clearance but they also give the spasming shit

help 2021-09-26 00:36:16 or how do i make a stronger engine
help 2021-09-26 00:36:25 i dont wanna just be bumbass and use propellers
help 2021-09-26 00:38:30 dont have the car and the engine connected to eachother?
help 2021-09-26 00:49:06 so have the body be connected to the piston

creations-chat 2021-11-20 23:52:52 i know im late to reply to this but holy shit thank you for actually giving me feedback rather than just shitting on my build lmao
creations-chat 2021-11-21 01:56:23 I'm changing my jeep to mold toward your review, i cant really change the overall shape too much, but what do you mean by hooks?
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:02:52 added slight color variations, the smaller headlights, turn indicators, tools, changed the jerry can color, added bumper, added the hook, and got rid of the rear fenders. <@!757887014388367401>  what other changes are needed? (also i cant change the body shape too much due to the chassis mechanics)
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:06:21 what do you think of the changes i made?
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:08:22 ay is it me or did the channel just get locked?
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:10:48 yes jojo, i definitely see this "difference"
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:15:24 heres a tip: look at the things people are complaining about: for example, someone said my jeep had a back fender when the real one did it, so I GOT RID OF IT. DO WHAT THE FEEDBACK TELLS YOU TO DO
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:20:40 in all fairness we, the plane crazy community sure like to tell people to just motor lock more detail in then proceed to not tell them what in specific to motor

*laughs* im in danger!
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:34:02 thx dawg.  upvotes and downvotes seem to agree that i improved it, too.
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:45:33 one of my older, shitter bodies. pls give feedback as to what i can do to add more detail. if you want me to motor lock, tell me what to motorlock.

creations-chat 2021-12-20 19:58:57 good idea. lets all ignore this. not good anyway.
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:01:19 damn ppl are already bein mean to my solid axle suspension
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:03:55 but how does that answer why ppl bein mean to it? do u mean that brain dead noobs dont understand it? or that ppl in hof think it isnt good enough (or both?)
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:07:26 i mean i guess. it probably would have helped if i had a body on it already

creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:36:26 damn thats tough. how could they hate it? i put MINUTES of work into that! its got a tow weight up there in the SIXES of pounds!
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:41:03 nah couldnt be low effort (the pictures are unrelated i just thought they were funny)

creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:13:31 the motors arent on zero. if the motors were on 0 it would always lean to one side or the other. also, the suspensions dont do anything. they arent connected to anything. just cosmetic
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:16:06 suspensions are cosmetic
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:18:42 as i said, servos. its a passive stabilizing system. like using reset motors but you can set a max angle. when body roll is assisted by physics they have opposite keybinds, and together have just enough torque for enertia to make the body lean. when you want it to be entirely servo driven you make them the same keybinds so their strength combine and enertia doesnt effect them.
