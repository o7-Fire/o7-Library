The Tale of bloodcrayons (582280821642100774)
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:53:33 today i just made my first aircraft that works
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:53:40 its a tiny blimp
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:54:29 it a custom giant propeller at the front,mounted on the blimp's main part which is made of helium beams and blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:55:13 four giant wings,2 on each side made of fabric and a very long vertical stabilizer so i can turn
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:56:24 the lower part has a motor with 3 rockets that can be fired independently
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:57:54 it has a cargo bay for lightweight cargo and a small hangar outside for tiny planes to land and a total of 5 seats
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:58:00 3 for passengers
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:58:03 a pilot
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:58:10 and a copilot
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:58:13 im so happy
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:59:01 by the way
plane-crazy 2022-01-13 23:59:58 it has a maximum altitude of 600 meters (about 670-690 if you go further using the propeller and wings)

creations-chat 2022-06-28 00:45:44 yea, after taking a second look i must admit its not the best <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2022-06-28 00:47:47 ok, ill try
creations-chat 2022-06-28 00:50:09 you know what? i guess its better to rebuild the entire thing again

but now bigger and more detailed
bot-central 2022-06-30 23:26:19 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:15:19 Why do i have the slight feeling a good percentage of this game's players only like fighter jets, and will hate on any build that is not a overmotorclocked fighter jet with 300+ blocks?

Ive also heard some of them only like military builds, is that true?
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:16:13 Ive been here for a month ig and i dont know much of the community, is it really like that?
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:18:21 I can barely motorlock and all my builds except for 2 are poop, youre not alone
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:20:12 Nice can i see it?
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:26:46 ?
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:35:02 They look excellent
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:35:35 Also i cant believe you turned on your pc just to share your builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:35:43 Thats awesome
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:36:28 Its 11pm here
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 02:36:53 My english is not very good

the-dump 2022-08-01 02:04:48 is that some sort of black magic?
the-dump 2022-08-01 02:07:26 THESE PEOPLE ARE WITCHES AND WIZARDS
the-dump 2022-08-01 02:07:36 LETS ROAST THEM ALIVE
creations-chat 2022-08-02 01:10:32 why do most creations that are not overlocked military vehicles get so much downvotes?
creations-chat 2022-08-02 01:12:54 oh hi there i didnt expect to see you again
general 2022-08-05 21:56:29 sad
general 2022-08-08 21:10:19 i legit almost had a happiness attack when i noticed the announcements channel highlighted
general 2022-08-08 21:10:28 then i got disappointed
general 2022-08-08 22:11:03 if youre optimistic, 19
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:00:23 Heavy wip (work in progress) VTOL military dropship/gunship, still gotta add the 8 custom engines, another pair of wings and maybe arms (yes, you read it right, arms);

Thinking about adding rocket pods;

Heavily inspired by the Grabber from intrusion 2, and 2 concept art images i found on page 2 of google.

(Also has 4 spring powered ejectable seats to save the crew [pilot, copilot, gunner and flight engineer])
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:04:19 still has lots of details to add, also, it would be useful if players had something like a personal flashlight to help with depth perception (it was a little tricky to detail the interior since everything is the same color)
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:19:37 not mine, just a cool bomber i saw and wanted to share
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:21:13 its a matter of opinion, i think it looks quite decent for an average player, its fine if you dont like it, it's not even mine anyways
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:25:07 yea whatever, i like to think that instead of insulting unexperienced players for their low-effort builds, it would be nice to compliment these players to encourage them to get better and learn to build (as i said before, its just a matter of opinion, no problem if you dont agree)

i also also apologize if my grammar is bad/horrible, english is not my primary language
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:27:50 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
the-dump 2022-08-13 15:25:09 Sadly i have to agree with this (this is also why i never had to guts to ask my crush out)
general 2022-08-16 00:09:55 imagine if the development channel suddenly lights up <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
general 2022-08-16 00:10:10 i know
general 2022-08-16 00:10:18 its always an option

creations-chat 2022-09-06 01:07:42 this is unacceptable
creations-chat 2022-09-06 01:09:48 i upvoted both because i always upvote all creations for some reason, but a literal spaceship got over 70 downvotes while a tiny sailboat got over 130 upvotes, what is wrong with pcc?
creations-chat 2022-09-06 01:13:33 community is the forbidden word
the-dump 2022-09-06 01:14:38 i try to be funny and this is the answer i get

general 2022-09-08 22:09:34 do people like you expect others to build in order to visually satisfy others?
general 2022-09-08 22:09:44 i tought the point of this game was having fun
general 2022-09-08 22:09:50 im disappointed
general 2022-09-08 22:10:36 shredder bugs are the worst kind of build in this game
general 2022-09-08 22:11:11 <:bigyoshi:557242825301819423>
general 2022-09-08 22:12:00 i dont do that (i dont share my creations lmao)
general 2022-09-08 22:13:05 someone people just want to share what they built and dont really expect others to react at all
general 2022-09-08 22:13:29 dont look at it, problem solved <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-09-08 22:14:18 same
general 2022-09-08 22:14:25 yea
general 2022-09-08 22:16:37 we all know these people are dead but like why does it matter, theyre (sadly) already gone and talking about how some people dont know about it won't bring them back
general 2022-09-08 22:16:48 tiktok is shitty
general 2022-09-08 22:17:28 as if you would remember
general 2022-09-08 22:18:56 i guess we all cared enough to reply
general 2022-09-08 22:19:55 yes
general 2022-09-08 22:21:13 why do i feel like almost all people in this server are always arguing about something?
general 2022-09-08 22:21:44 we dont talk about <#504436696021204992>

general 2022-09-08 22:32:45 i think only <#497142796961054721> alone would be too much for a group of 10 high quality and experienced moderators, i dont judge them for leaving us to rot here
general 2022-09-08 22:34:13 only if the staff cared enough to do that <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2022-09-08 22:46:40 i dont think it would look pretty

plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:56:01 sad
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:56:19 ik but its not the same thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:56:47 i think rickje would add it if it wasnt for roblox shit "physics"
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:57:09 i once tried to
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:58:47 it came out looking like a giant soda can with 5 block long wings with tiny boats at the tips and sidewards facing bunny ears
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:58:59 it was an abomination
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 22:59:22 you could vomit just by looking at it
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 23:02:43 funny enough, the original lun class ekranoplan (KM) looked like exacty what a 8 year old would build in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 23:03:32 i know its necessary, but just looking at the engine placement makes it look weird/ugly
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 23:05:43 lol
general 2022-09-23 23:00:35 is roblox laggy af for yall too? it went down 3 times in a row
general 2022-09-23 23:01:28 true true, i agree with your statement
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 23:37:17 summer is gone just like rickje's soul
