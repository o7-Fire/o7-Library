help 2019-09-27 20:26:10 so it should be 100 speed correct?
help 2019-09-27 20:26:12 ok
help 2019-09-27 20:33:30 k well it doesnt break anymore its just slow as a tortoise and it dont fly
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 21:08:53 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 21:09:03 can we buff large jet engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 21:09:17 why are four small ones better than one large one
general 2019-10-29 06:36:30 guys i made a 100% mechanical chinook
general 2019-10-29 06:37:01 yes
general 2019-10-30 05:25:52 anybody made a working bell 212 yet?
general 2019-10-30 05:26:11 like, the proper way, without rockets or jets?
general 2019-10-30 06:18:34 yeah but like
general 2019-10-30 06:18:55 how do you make it stay upright without the stacked rotors
general 2019-10-30 06:24:06 non coaxial
general 2019-10-30 06:24:09 thats the word
general 2019-10-30 06:24:22 how make too hard for me small head
general 2019-10-31 02:36:35 how make non-coaxial 😠
the-dump 2019-10-31 02:45:00 stfu boomer
general 2019-10-31 04:29:06 if anyone makes a non coaxial heli please let me know
general 2019-10-31 05:54:33 alright im confident that i just suck at this game
general 2019-10-31 05:54:41 what the frick
general 2019-11-02 06:30:19 guys ok heres the issue
general 2019-11-02 06:30:26 how make rack and pinion?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:00:46 what is the easiest way to make gears of cogs?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:13:57 guys guys guys guys how make rack and pinion
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:17:31 what the frick i spent like 10 minutes trying to make a steering system in the most realistic way possible and this guys comes in and is like
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:18:00 aha but his wheels are not level with the ground i can make better one
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:18:26 oh wait that isnt true steering i aint mad no more
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:18:39 ok i see
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:19:05 it isnt like true steering though because the wheels are moving foreward and back
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:19:25 i did that man it just wont work
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:22:24 https://gyazo.com/986748280970465597f01cc5cc71e078
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:22:28 it doesnt i promise
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:22:58 does the friction block even do anything?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:23:13 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:23:26 does changing the texture do things?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:23:30 thats cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:24:28 ok it works but it is really shoddy
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:25:50 go away
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:25:54 i made it work man
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:46:51 <@456226577798135808> the fabric wasnt welded to the thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:47:00 i have wedges and half blocks under
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 07:47:06 also i made it work
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:00:08 i made steering system haha very cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:11:40 guys what is the most compact universal join that you can make?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:19:11 i made steering yaya
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:36:17 <@!216193164199985152> i tried to make it more compact but it aint workin
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:36:18 https://gyazo.com/e5e2b71a8891a92c22b08347b9156a35
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:36:22 any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:36:57 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:37:17 well it works extremely reliably on the bigger design that i put together
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:39:00 https://gyazo.com/cb64ddbfb1df64835651e6951ef96071
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:40:09 up like vertically?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:40:28 i dont see how that could happen
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:40:34 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:44:16 but it doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:44:25 it is only moving along one axis
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:44:30 left and right
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:45:06 what do you mean by not stop?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:45:34 i can if i remove the constraints on the rack
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:45:52 but it is constrained
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:48:38 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:48:59 you were mentioning another method for the rack and pinion earlier
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:49:09 would you mind sharing?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:49:56 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:50:19 is there a way to make it work on such a small scale?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:57:19 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 08:57:26 ill give er a try
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 09:14:24 ok well it aint workin
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 09:14:56 im gonna go to bed maybe ill get it in the morning

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 21:51:15 i made it work
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 21:52:30 ok how do i make a ball joint?
general 2019-11-02 21:53:35 anybody have a super compact ball joint design
general 2019-11-03 00:36:16 yeah but you need to use your imagination
general 2019-11-03 00:36:25 this is roblox after all
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 04:33:30 <@!216193164199985152> i made it work, double wishbone suspension system with functional steering arm!
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 04:59:45 by the way thanks for the tips about the rack
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:05:02 now comes the fun part
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:05:33 i get to implement suspension with a differential steering system
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:05:47 mind you a differential steering system i havent come up with yet
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:32:22 wait so you know how if you make something fabric it has more friction?
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:32:26 is there an opposite
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:38:23 that was so unfunnt jay im so unfunny not laugh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:39:16 bro i made this account when i was like 8
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:39:34 and i mean
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:39:44 make a railgun
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:39:52 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:40:12 yeah try and do cool tricks where you throw it at metal things
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:40:21 and make it stick
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:40:35 good idea
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:42:04 guys i made cool suspension
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:45:52 cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:46:16 did you know that you have been playing google chrome for over an hour?

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:47:19 im so proud of myself
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 05:47:58 i made suspension steering thingy and its super cool and definately nescescary for a working car

general 2019-11-05 01:15:05 hi
general 2019-11-05 01:15:28 do you know if the damping parameter does anything on a suspension block
general 2019-11-05 01:16:11 naw
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 01:20:22 oh ok thanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 01:21:42 makes sense

Variable Speed Control for Motors.
Mechanical

Add a toggleable setting to motors allowing them to behave like jet engines and propellers, in the sense that speed is applied linearly as opposed to only full speed, off or reverse.
