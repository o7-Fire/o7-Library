creations-chat 2022-11-10 04:56:31 True also the A-10 never had any modern cameras which lead to many friendly fire incidents, I think around at least 11 friendly’s were killed and in one in incident a A-10 blew up a friendly British convoy.

creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:00:07 Oh that was fixed like 2000 or sownthing
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:02:19 Accc longer prob still troops really hated it. Also still should’ve been fixed way earlier
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:06:20 Pilots not soldiers on the ground. Sure some of em love it but it’s not as good as you think. It’s pretty good for teAring up the Middle East tho
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:09:42 Some might not be but a lot of em are. Keep in mind the A-10 is a pretty old aircraft not really meant for todays battlefield and it’s main purpose to tear up tanks it’s uh kinda not good at doing. I mean to be fair we just middle eastern poor countries so yea it has a purpose
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:12:54 I mean helicopters and the ac-130 can fit the roll just fine, and get this, ac-130s can be fitted with hellfire missles pretty cool
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:15:20 Nah nothing yet and the f35 shouldn’t even be considered . And to answer the other guys question prob but it’s better and has more accuracy and we have a large number of money to do a whole lot with
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:17:21 It might be although to be fair the a-114 aardvark was a far better tank destroyer , not much use for it nor was it good at close air support but I felt like it should,be been kept or replaced
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:19:25 They might their looking at cheaper options rn like the f-16 aging fleet tho it was considered like 2 times and was rejected 2 times. Around same age as that A-10
