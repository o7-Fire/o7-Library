general 2020-08-06 16:08:15 I have a question
general 2020-08-06 16:08:57 What does "<--Scammer" mean?
general 2020-08-09 01:29:21 WHAT DOES <â€”SCAMMER MEAN
general 2020-08-09 01:29:25 IM SO CONFUSED
general 2020-08-09 01:31:26 That doesnâ€™t really answer my question
general 2020-08-09 01:31:28 Eee

general 2020-08-09 01:32:47 Iâ€™m waiting for more wedges
general 2020-08-09 01:32:51 Like damn
general 2020-08-09 01:33:01 I want my builds to be smooth
general 2020-08-09 01:33:19 Hmm
general 2020-08-09 01:33:39 Honesty i all I want is a gyroscope
general 2020-08-09 01:33:54 So that my zeppelin Isnâ€™t absolutely full of wing panels
general 2020-08-09 01:40:51 I stuff the inside of my zeppelin with wing panels, to stop it from turning unexpectedly or rolling side to side
general 2020-08-09 01:41:05 There are probably better ways to do that, but that has worked for now
general 2020-08-09 01:41:27 So a gyroscope would remove the need for excess parts, and keep the whole thing level
