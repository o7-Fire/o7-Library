I've been at it for a while
Thanks jeff that's helpful
creations-chat 2022-01-21 15:07:24 cringe
oops meant to reply to hyperbot downvoting
very nice build though
creations-chat 2022-01-21 15:12:37 it's not a meme build it's just a build
That happened to turn into a meme
bot-central 2022-01-21 15:15:37 !help
bot-central 2022-01-21 15:15:42 bruh no don't dm me
creations-chat 2022-01-22 01:37:43 besides not using a mac, what can I improve on this so far? (I'll paint later)
creations-chat 2022-01-22 01:39:46 Wedges and angle lock on what? Also lemme post a different angle
I've tried wedges, but the wedges are going upwards, so I can't make them go backwards too
creations-chat 2022-01-22 01:42:11 I can't use wedges backwards, as you can see. Imma look up angle lock tutorials
Isn't angle lock the thing where you use tnt to make custom angles? I tried that, and I blew myself up
Not to mention it doesn't work in non-pvp servers where I usually play to not get spawnkilled
creations-chat 2022-01-22 01:45:51 beacuse it'll look too much like brick
creations-chat 2022-01-22 01:48:42 make the flesh more fleshy
And stop doing my mum
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:07:11 it's very good if u ask me... imo it looks almost the same
Better than I can do
Also just outta curiosity can I see a build <@!790634040780390440>
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:09:28 It's a block game...
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:11:30 looks to real for a block game
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:14:59 <@!790634040780390440> Can I see one of your ships for reference? I can't find many ships in creations to go off of bow shape
Or anyone for that matter
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:26:31 "I feel like when people call a jet "custom" or a "successor" its just a failed attempt at a real jet."
Wow nice.
Still, can be applied to ships
Just make it "I feel like when people call a ~~jet~~ boat "custom" or a "successor" its just a failed attempt at a real ~~jet~~ boat.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:28:36 also <@!790634040780390440>  it doesn't seem you put much effort into those bows... they're just sideways wedges. I can't do that since my wedges go up, and I blow myself up with angle lock
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:30:38 ah yes my bow is an original design of modern engineering
More than yours
Your boat is what 1/3 of a plot?
And that bow used sideways wedges, so you really can't critise anything <@!790634040780390440> , since your builds are just smaller versions of that
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:32:55 <@!790634040780390440> not to mention that was my second ship ever built or maybe third I can't remember
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:39:30 <@!790634040780390440> These appear to be your first 2 ships, and that was my second-third. You used a ton of angle lock, yet still came up with these tiny no-detail builds? Most of that could'e honestly been achieved without angle lock
You may be more advanced in locking, but use that skill to make better builds, not some small ships like these
I never said you used no angle lock? I said you used a ton for no result
I honestly think you can use your skill to make something legendary, but you make these?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:41:48 Wut's that supposed to mean
Do you mean I should submit for a rank or sum?
Anyway imma go play Phantom Forces you guys have fun
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:43:50 i don't have much experience in plane crazy. What I'm saying is you're not using your angle lock to its fullest extent. Using that much angle lock for a tiny build that could've been achieved without angle lock? Come on.
<@!758208036631347230> What's that supposed to mean
Also, Purple, you could probably achieve a build way better than mine in the same time with angle lock. You should honestly try to make a nice big ship.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:45:54 Ok now I'll actually go die in Phantom forces you guys have fun
creations-chat 2022-01-23 08:12:40 ok
creations-chat 2022-01-23 10:11:52 just look up yt tutorials
creations-chat 2022-01-23 11:29:59 build something unseen to man

creations-chat 2022-02-20 20:38:02 not even 4 parts lol
creations-chat 2022-02-20 21:01:08 Agreed. The world uses the British Pound now.

Also <@!726536526972059679> Yes, that many revolutionary non-invented yet British pieces of technology
creations-chat 2022-02-20 21:18:04 oh yeah my bad was thinking of WWII Not wwii, before wwii
Also I'm a history major do you expect me NOT to be an idiot?
Sorry, I'm being stupider than usual today
creations-chat 2022-02-20 21:20:26 Damn that must be ruff
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:25:04 Can someone tell me why my motor 2s just break apart, with the top part just teleporting to the unknown realms, and the bottom part staying put?
bug-reports 2022-07-08 17:18:17 bruh ok
bug-reports 2022-07-08 17:23:13 Whenever I place a turret, no matter how small, on a motor 2, it always teleports under the world (I had da friend sit on one). The only fix I can find that doesn't completely immobilise the turret is placing a motor on top of the motor 2, and moving the motor 2 down a block. But this causes the turret to swing back and fourth after bearing on the spot my cursor is on. It never stops swinging, so I'm just stuck there with uncontrolled turrets.

bug-reports 2022-07-08 17:23:24 This is the last ship I haven't replaced the motors yet
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:21:50 as in? How do I fix it
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:21:57 it worked fine like a couple months ago
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:22:05 then suddenly I tried to play a naval battle and it glitched
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:22:59 damn I need a good pc for roblox now?
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:22 oh ironically
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:24 I'm using a mac
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:52 well this sucks
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:24:34 yeah I use chrome browser
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:25:13 how would I go about finding it
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:25:37 can you lock motor 2s?
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:03 I use anchor blocks
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:06 but then as soon as I unanchor
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:07 they leave
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:32 I mean as I said
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:40 the motors are the only way they don't leave, I tried disconnectors
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:57 I tried everything that has 2 parts
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:27:57 what's weird though is
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:02 the turrets upsidedown on my larger ships
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:05 don't teleport
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:44 I mean all up side up turrets teleport
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:50 I never use pistons in my ships
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:06 yeah well
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:09 it's only the turrets too
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:12 the machien guns don't tp
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:14 I'll try googling it
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:32 it's the one thing I haven't tried lol
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:45 hm
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:50 well
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:53 that should be fun
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:37:25 When I spawn on water is the only problem, water works
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:38:06 I mean land
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:38:09 when I spawn on land works
bug-reports 2022-07-09 23:00:16 That‚Äôs my second oldest boat, but I dunno what you mean by that meme
bug-reports 2022-07-10 00:47:31 Thanks :)
bug-reports 2022-07-10 00:47:53 You didn‚Äôt even screenshot the fully loaded version
bug-reports 2022-07-10 00:48:09 If you want real bad, I can show you my first boat
bug-reports 2022-07-10 02:20:37 Thanks :)
bug-reports 2022-07-10 02:21:18 Yeah it does that now it used to spawn fully above the water dunno what happened to that, it went wrong same time as turrets
bug-reports 2022-07-10 02:21:57 Also if you don‚Äôt like the design, complain to the people from 1960 who designed the heavy cruiser. The fact that it‚Äôs ugly is a compliment because I copied it so well
bug-reports 2022-07-10 02:23:12 I‚Äôd like to see your ship from 3 days into the game for reference on what a beginner ship is supposed to look like
bug-reports 2022-07-10 02:24:39 And keep in mind the ship has to have working torpedo launchers and 6 battles with a 100% winrate
