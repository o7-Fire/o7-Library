bug-reports 2022-10-31 08:56:12 Hello, I have had this problem for a long time now. When i fire pvp rockets when i am moving, in the air or on the ground, they just vanish bur when i stand still and am not moving i can see them firing. I have tried changing the graphics quality if it is a rendering problem but that doesn't work. I tried on an other account and it also doesn't work, it may be a graphics issue. If it is how do i fix it? It doesn't seem that that many people have this problem, i have only found one video about it on youtube but nothing else.

bug-reports 2022-10-31 12:01:01 Ok, thanks for the help. I am going to try and change some graphics settings to see if it changes.
bug-reports 2022-11-02 10:34:20 It isn't connection issues, it works on another computer that is on the same network. My ping is also very good.
bug-reports 2022-12-14 15:50:57 Hello, if someone knows a solution please let me know. When i fire rockets when moving they just vanish, there isn't any trace of them. Its not that they just aren't rendering because there isn't anything there. When i am standing still though they do fire as normal. When i try on a different computer it works. The thing is that my computer that i usually play on has a better graphics card, better ram and a better processor.
