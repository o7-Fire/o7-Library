plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:05:00 yes? or no
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:07:21 its supposed to be a hyperdrive build that held supreme maneuverability, its slow but the "plane" turns good
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:09:40 anyone ever feel like a "not good" person becuz of their creations?
i once make a mig carrying airborne smoke generator
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:10:24 cuz the cold war era consists of flying tubes
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:10:58 its also quite brain ded to build one
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:11:09 they are beautiful
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:11:22 and more useful than you >:)
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:12:35 i once made a flying destroyer, it travels at 600 speed and at 50 speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:13:48 
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:14:13 you to mate
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:15:20 who likes building torpedo bombers?
general 2020-12-02 12:12:58 so i build a creation using hover thrusters engine, i can't find much use for it except for a plane filled with bombs
general 2020-12-06 15:54:35 hmmm
general 2020-12-06 15:55:34 why putting pistons on motors just bugs everything
general 2020-12-06 15:56:05 like my 16/50 guns are having spasm
general 2020-12-06 15:56:31 ok mason
general 2020-12-06 16:00:06 i like the V1
general 2020-12-06 16:00:14 make it happen Elon
general 2020-12-06 16:01:37 the rocket should have parachute or ejection seat tho
general 2020-12-06 16:02:11 true
general 2020-12-06 16:02:22 except 9/11, the rest is true :L
general 2020-12-06 16:03:27 instead of a recoverable dive, you spin so fast the pilot just passes out if hes not fast enough
general 2020-12-06 16:03:59 dying is safest
general 2020-12-06 16:04:03 no suffering
general 2020-12-06 16:04:10 no pain=safe

plane-crazy 2020-12-07 04:31:04 Look no further
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 04:31:51 Putting pistons on motors cause the extension to go up in a spasm

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:46:21 it no longer makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:16:46 To the person who first discovered the shredder

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:17:58 Isn’t that too much to ask for?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:19:11 I don’t see copying is bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:19:36 I mean, the techniques to achieve Sth should be learned from others
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:20:33 I used to built flaps with big holes, like very big holes
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:21:18 I use control surfaces to cover it up now
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:21:33 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:22:17 My build is just wack
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:22:52 It has a body of a tank now
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:22:59 Cuz y not?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:24:19 I tried to build a layout for my chinook, when the rotors spins it just travels at 600 speed without glitch engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:25:32 And some reasons planes shakes violently when traveling at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:25:50 Build them smol
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:26:19 Like a prop engine on a block small
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:26:48 Holy

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:28:16 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:29:04 I hate motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:29:10 But I need them
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:29:17 What a predicament
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:29:58 How small
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:30:30 How would it work
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:33:59 How to build and not spam
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:34:41 Ive seen starter planes stacking stupid amount of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:35:14 Wot is coax?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:35:44 Contra rotors?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:36:23 Okay
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:36:48 I’ve advance to glitch motors :LL
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:36:59 What I need is how to design
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:37:17 Wut
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:38:14 I used to see a person with rotating blades of death, fast and flyable
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:38:36 Like it’s spooky af
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:39:19 Scientific advancement made
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:40:25 How cool would it be to have artilleries

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:22:52 i got 3 shreaders in a game, yes please
creations-chat 2020-12-20 13:25:48 hows my monstrosity
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 04:29:56 is this a shreader ?

plane-crazy 2020-12-25 06:07:51 when the server has ships for your torpedo bombing crave
but there were to many that explosives stops responding
creations-chat 2021-01-31 13:56:12 i have made a functioning harrier, how to make the actual one?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:05:46 uhm okay, how should i build parts in plane crazy that matches rl (i tried making the U2, ended up being a t-pose plane)
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:11:55 i somehow nailed the vtol part before adding meaningful shapes to make it ressembles a harrier, the problem before adding wings that i face was not able to control the plane while floating, that was fixed by adding control surfaces
anyway, i dont wanna rip down the thing and then nailing the design, the thing im lacking is power and willpower to add *curves*, how to fix that issue?
thks for feedback, i'll check the tool
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 04:15:55 guys how do you add grids to see when building
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 04:25:56 i meant grid on mah builds, not the plot, cuz my eye blind and im too lazy to color my builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 04:32:17 my eyes, it burns
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 04:32:35 my laptop, smelled like boilled eggs

plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:14:10 hey, its a bomb and not a shredder missile, so its gotta be funny, right?

plane-crazy 2021-03-14 19:10:29 no one can see that
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 19:10:56 ya know those nets that pokes out the carrier
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:14:02 hows my flaps
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:16:04 sounds very neat, but i meant the gray part that got extended/foiled down
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:18:40 imma paint it, i dont wanna use the custom made control surfaces cuz i dont know how to use motor 2 for that/ rollrate and speeds pretty ded/ it may overun the wing area, kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:25:51 apparently adding the new springs possesses my plane for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:27:24 
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:28:46 dear god, the shredders
its them again, how to cure from them
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:29:22 its not even pvp tho 🙂
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:29:49 its like one of those motor locked infested builds, but this time its for springs
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:36:53 half wedge 1
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:38:02 ironic
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 15:40:22 cant make out the full context of the air intake positioning, but looks quite close
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:14:04 how does this makes you feel
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:16:26 was expecting worse tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:13:14 help, bomb gone loose
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:19:47 wheres the gibs
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:44:03 pain
creations-chat 2021-04-30 05:31:16 Hows my obese u boat
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:00:56 any ideas on how to make this bomber head looking less chuby? (its detachable for exiting reasons, compromises will be made)
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:47:38 fat
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:52:36 america

JK
creations-chat 2021-05-09 10:18:30 how can i improve the chubby plane
creations-chat 2021-05-09 10:20:53 the bombay from within the plane
creations-chat 2021-05-09 15:56:07 A bit late to reply but, apologies. Let’s just hope my potato laptop doesn’t crash while I test for the custom control panels. Oh yeah, it needed those cheese grinders cuz back elevator and vert stabilizer is dead (vertical position when building) so those cheese grinders are quite important to wrangle the plane (vertically inverted controls). But anyways, let see what I can do
creations-chat 2021-05-10 06:46:48 <@!466673912760107009>motor lock pain
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:48:09 modified av8b harrier, how to improve
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:54:08 made sense
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:21:37 :((, im sad
Thanks for the feedback anyway (bad color palete is my attempt of painting winter camo, didnt go too well)
-imma paint all white if it hurts your eyes seeing what i posted
- revert to og vert stabilizer?
-bad graphics cuz laptop uses antique GPU, apologies 
- glitchy wing if i do angle my wings
-no, im not great at motor locks
-cheese graters to control jet in vtol better (less dedicated engine for controlling)
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:29:57 Is there anymore specific ways i can improve my "harrier-inspired" jet
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:39:37 appreciated, and dont just circle the whole thing
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:48:16 a very detailed description of what i did wrong, thank you
-intake is close to the front "nozzle", a bulge
-bomb placement is purely comical, just to maximise angryness
-im bad at nose design, kill me
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:42:47 just something i found neat
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:45:37 harrier, some "SU"s?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:45:56 harrier is brit
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:46:07 i believe f22 does have
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:46:29 hey, i like tea 😦
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:47:29 people associate government with china more than tea with british (not political, just meme)
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:50:13 mhh, gotta love eastern medicine
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:50:45 practically more sophisticated than western until penicilin
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:51:12 i live under china lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:52:37 it already exist within the form of lousy hitboxes
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:52:53 trails can go through control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 07:55:09 found that out trying to make struts that supports ju-87's rear horizontal stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:33:52 whats this convo
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:46:36 what you mean by scaling
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:46:56 in game?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:47:15 changing size, and thus angle of objects?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:48:27 yoooooooooo
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:48:33 thats goodd
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:48:42 how to do that in game
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:48:59 ah, well im for it
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:49:29 would be helpful in something like wing angles
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:49:50 hey thats not nice to your self :((
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:50:51 if building is easier, it is more complex and accurate, building standards will be higher
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:53:00 nah, im just saying, that if the community likes to build stuff accurately, with more detail, and not like trying to figure out how to do grade 9 asian math questions, then its better if they get the tools to do so
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 08:59:52 shredder is pretty weird tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 09:00:30 its fine if its complex, its not fine if such complex is a pain to build
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:33:12 any improvements can i make for my plane?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:35:21 a better view
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:21:29 torpedo bomber or really good (self)cruise missile, what should i build?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:23:01 smol gun
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:23:29 or you could make the 16/50 mark 7 gun
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:23:46 how that turned out
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:32:23 peni gun is big gun :>
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:33:15 cuz mini guns are tied to the hovering bois
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:47:27 hmm, sadge
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:54:31 do german builds allowed to have "that" symbol in sake of historical accuraccy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:59:43 reflects modern army, not the other one
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 11:59:58 thats just sad, imagine me262 in 2021
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:23:26 where can i get a better POV of the ww2 version of USS Midway
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:26:12 i believe you can manually change the color of paint by changing the value of the color shown in the color tab (you might wanna paste existing color "coordinates" instead of guessing)
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:33:17 color combination uses the three values (x,y,z) corresponding to red, green, blue
<@!229035780423680001>  your should find a color palete online to ease up the gradient mixing thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:44:06 whats this plane's name, looks smexy :))
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:44:19 mhhh, come to papa
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:48:07 why dont you use motor 2 and bind all angle keys to one key?
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:48:36 eww
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:49:27 dunno why people with starter planes kept building spiky wings, ofc i cant say much about your skill in this pic, you might be a chad :))
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:50:31 why not? you can set angle, then put on toggle
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:51:38 yeah, to an extent i do, my builds aint that complicated to ran into welding issues
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:53:07 i angle the wing, only that, the only usual motor lock i use is counter balance or adding wing to wing
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:53:42 oh pls, im nub :((
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:54:56 yep, thats why my f14 and other builds with angled wings have huge gapping holes to them
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 01:59:19 its just cause i guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:02:17 how do you put motor lock on motor lock?
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:03:55 why arent you shakin like mad tho, my f14 just shakes
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:05:00 nah, motor 2 are only used for rear contorl
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:05:49 oh, nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:05:57 my i copy for future use?
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:06:35 oh yeah, can you place colored blocks to indicate where can i put the blocks to the motor locks?
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:07:03 any
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:07:25 but im worse than you :))
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:11:30 uhm, so when i use these motor locks to stack bombs, where can i place the disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:12:43 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:12:55 sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:13:34 wut?

-<@!694009880507580528> ah, massive pain
creations-chat 2021-05-17 08:15:03 the white part that sits on the deck is the island, is my island big enough for this ship?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 11:49:05 Well yeah, you can call it something else, but’s it’s commonly referred to as the island
creations-chat 2021-05-18 03:57:57 how did i do?
and what more to add except to finish building and painting
creations-chat 2021-05-18 06:18:03 damn god, he be spraying napalm
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:29:50 yo, how you get mc fonts like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:31:03 oh yeah guys, quick question, how do you cope with building >2000 blocks builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:32:26 whos ifkin, is he a chad?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:33:07 im just imagining him hunting people down with a C-5 Galaxy
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:34:50 how do you deal with mental pain when building big builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:36:48 its cuz recently im attempting to build big builds for first time, that needs folds, and its hard ngl
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:37:45 i have to fold the superstructure twice to fit in the plot
general 2021-05-18 06:39:14 how about bbq
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:40:54 but why, advanced kamikaze?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:41:46 screenshot pls, i(we) need to see
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:42:14 WIP not allowed here?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:42:28 lucky you
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:43:43 hmm, im just gonna imagine your build in build mode lookin like noodles
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:44:44 is there heavy camera uses and motor locks everywhere?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:45:32 aye, you found something that actually hurts to my eyes and the others
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:46:16 a salvo of this knocks a ship in peaceful lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:46:32 and im proud of it :))
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:47:13 pepsi man aint got moves on it
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:47:47 its intentional, or rather my first attempt to make custom missiles
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:48:38 yah can never have enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:49:29 "there is no shame in deterrence my friend, having a weapon is different from using it"
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:52:19 yall know what, imma rename my plane the coke coker
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:52:59 thanks for the suggestions lads
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:53:41 ights im gonna
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 06:54:35 you have image perms?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:03:00 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:04:05 keeps the wings cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:06:39 wut
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:06:56 im confused ah
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:07:17 oh yeah this
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 07:08:49 yes
creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:22:42 aint that copying?
<@!701949629708632096> cool
creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:25:23 understandable, have a great day (night)
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 14:42:54 you can never have enough amirite?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 14:44:18 same
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 01:55:34 i think plane slow cuz server cant handle big builds moving at fast speed, so server slows the plane down
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 01:56:26 yeah, usually so
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 01:57:28 for some reason, plane moving at 100 moves faster than plane moving at 300
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:05:36 -Prob add functional smokescreen?
- a tow cable would be great if it wasnt added alr
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:09:56 at that moment, the winged hussars arrived
btw, any of yall built a winged hussar? would be epic
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:21:59 maybe cuz i used non-gamer gear so my setup displays magic
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:30:57 looks like bootleg millennium falcon tbh, yeah, tumor
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:32:53 i think its more of a deterrent than anything else, just a display of force you know?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:33:50 aint that ruins the point of pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:34:39 i think we should cutter's hitboxes more consistent
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:34:57 cuz somehow you can get hit while the aggresor is far
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:35:32 :L, at least make it less worse when theres lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:36:17 that exist?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:36:53 apologies, mein wifi sucks
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:38:55 people dont have brain or time to design and build decent looking vehicles to attach weapons to
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:39:54 or you could knock those vehicles into the air
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:40:53 can you explain this sentence, im new to the tnt armor thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:42:46 so the armor works by repelling far range attacks, but is vulnerable to short range, power weapons?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:43:40 i just looked at those tnt and thought the tank just wanna banzai the enemy
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:45:13 but becuz you use tnt armor, if they go inside you, you can banzai
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:46:24 the other is already using stone age manners against you, so theres no different if they were gonna 1 slice you anyway
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:47:02 :L, its a possibility
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:48:29 bite za dusto in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:49:31 just sayin, its possible, albeit slim
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:50:13 i see fireworks is quite effective

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 02:54:35 i attached like 12 rockets on a turret on a fast moving plane, is it camping?
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:55:46 do it, winged hussars op

-<@!723940197456281640> more details i suppose, might be a doozy
creations-chat 2021-05-19 05:21:15 heres the folded view

-<@!723940197456281640> thanks, i will try to add more details considering the amount of folds
creations-chat 2021-05-19 05:24:12 that was my first attempt at big builds, how did i do?
creations-chat 2021-05-19 05:29:31 quick question, hows the ship's rear
creations-chat 2021-05-19 05:32:06 im concerned

-<@!723940197456281640> LOL
creations-chat 2021-05-19 09:30:34 shoulder could house rockets cuz why not
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:32:54 check the internals?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:33:47 you could motor lock the turret onto the chasis
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:34:20 or that you create little room for motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:34:43 thats weird
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:35:06 dont rage when it doesnt fix issue, cuz i dont know more
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:37:12 motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:38:02 okay....
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:38:10 we will see them results
creations-chat 2021-05-19 09:40:07 i was thinking like inserting the rockets into the shoulder block, but yeah this looks way more fun
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:41:54 pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:43:21 is the turret siting on a block and then on the motor?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:46:15 build something else to relieve pressure
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:56:26 congrats

creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:50:15 what a predicament amirite?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:52:21 im sure you can do custom angles for wings
you can try motor lock magic to decrease the height

-you gotta do what ya gotta do
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:54:35 what magic is this

-restart pc
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:56:47 it actually looks kinda decent

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 00:57:00 add cameras for shield :DD
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:11:14 click on them, then pres config, and then set bind
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:12:53 how about you replace blocks, and then add disconnecters layer, so that they know that there was an additional layer of blocks
creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:16:58 if you are mad and want to achieve the greatest accuracy for your build, then you should tear them up, then build them back
or you can add half blocks to increase width :LL
creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:22:11 oh yeah guys, how to add catapults for aircraft carriers and such?
creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:25:21 i would say for counter balance
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:26:19 you see the little screwdriver when you click on an adjustable block?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:26:30 click on it from the cameras
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:27:33 there should appear a bar ,instead of a hud, in the lower part of the screen, where the "r,t,y" buttons are found

creations-chat 2021-05-23 09:49:27 I’m planning to get rank with this, it is over 4K blocks but I don’t think it can achieve them upvotes, what more should I do?
creations-chat 2021-05-23 09:58:25 So I just need to paint more, and add in details like secondary batteries, AA gun mounts, antennas, catapults and etc?


Will do, thanks

i dont wanna be called low-effort becuz of simple color scheme
creations-chat 2021-05-24 04:17:35 hmm, this might be hard since theres the majority of the community with them skillz
creations-chat 2021-05-24 04:26:26 given the space and my poor building skills, yes
carrier's lore, nah
creations-chat 2021-05-24 04:30:25 you made a point
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:18:16 dunno man, i like the rectangles carriers or the chopping board design more, they look classic
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:21:19 they do tho, just harder to implement, or is it just me who cant build them
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:44:20 oh boy, i get to witnessed the fire

yo, how would this work
general 2021-05-29 02:10:37 rockets would move at a straight line, and only start tracking when it is close to pvp creation
or is there something idk?
general 2021-05-29 02:49:10 nah, i didnt notice or that when i fire missiles it doesnt act that way
general 2021-05-29 02:50:58 so it already tracks the targets, so how do you "lock" on the target
general 2021-05-29 02:52:12 im confused about how the rocket acts, did you mention that rockets would "track" the target, and so would chase the target without you leading in advance?
general 2021-05-29 02:53:40 so the, how to perform this tracking rocket thing, i always cant perform this kind of action
general 2021-05-29 02:54:29 how near
general 2021-05-29 02:54:46 :L
general 2021-05-29 02:55:08 lets look at the building plot, how close is it relative to the plot?
general 2021-05-29 02:55:56 might as well be point blank shots i guess
general 2021-05-29 02:56:24 dunno why you need a hud at that distance, when the attacker is right behind you
general 2021-05-29 02:56:58 wish it would act more like the AIM 9s
general 2021-05-29 02:57:31 and not "autotracking cuz you suck at point blank shots but whatever lets fix that" rockets
general 2021-05-29 02:59:30 i see theres no problem to gun effects except that its inconsistent
general 2021-05-29 03:00:03 why red bullet travel less farther than yellow bullets

creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:38:12 pardon me, i held no amount of skill capable of making sharp nose in small area

- also, the cheese grater got bolted with another one, issue of cheese fixed
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:42:10 dont think that way, it hurts brain, i simply meant i cant perform such task building a sharp nose, for a plane, in a small amount of given space
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 03:42:39 im just gonna leave this here
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:45:20 im just gonna search the plane here to see how they did the nose

general 2021-06-03 08:35:32 those arent caves
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:25:40 you can try and use the half wedge in wedge 2, ie the smallest block, then motor lock it into position
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:27:45 use it in conjunction with sparklers

sparklers for muzzle break
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:30:03 you can try this cancer method
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:33:38 what i meant was, motor lock the half wedges into center position, then build that massive motor lock tower, and then further motor lock sparklers onto it, or is it that it doesnt look good?

plane-crazy 2021-06-03 09:36:04 i fealt like that was long time ago, cuz bots sends creations and not users, but does it still apply, and for what explanation?
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:38:35 i have never seen me262 with box engine design tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 09:39:42 hmm, i think he should unpin that to avoid confusion
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:42:44 people have not drop feedbacks for my pen when they downvote it, weird
creations-chat 2021-06-03 10:28:22 Will fix
creations-chat 2021-06-03 11:46:29 Are we getting into custom engine?
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:04:19 The average 2013 computer does not approve such propulsion methods

Aren’t conveyor and hover drives are glitch engines?
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:07:28 Come on iPhone 6, load pic
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:12:39 improved f104

i did:
-changing the proportions of the front wing and verti stabiliser 
-add 2 more drop tanks under the wings, and make drops tanks able to be dropped
-change the rear wedge part to fix the back proportion problem, im not going to move 2 very complicated motor locked towers that resides there

what more can i do to improve plane

*also the on ground vibration problem, how to fix that?*
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:34:37 yeah, thats what i did, it just to compensate my lazy ass to modify the whole rear
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:40:28 do you have any way to fix this, cuz i think its somewhat still in proportion
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:44:40 its too long i think, aight, imma go and fix it
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:55:13 i dont think this works, imma tryna make wing 6 block long

creations-chat 2021-06-05 13:17:03 your iteration of the livery just reminds me of choc milkshake lol

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:35:14 ._. interesting turn of events
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:36:26 should we spare him, or no?

cuz last time i see your skills in a picture, its you in a pink, persumably, russian bomber chasing after fighters
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:37:15 pretty large plane, and it doing stunts
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:38:06 i remember much bigger jets

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:52:05 i think they just lag, shredders cant be going that slow
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:29:38 even number wide planes and creations are pain, i think you should use only 1 motor that is locked to centralized your middle details
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:30:28 what the c.o.m mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:31:04 whats on that side anyways
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:31:28 also, why custom control surfaces sucky looking
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:31:49 those are wide gaping holes
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:32:35 imma just demonstrate how to get it closer
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:33:45 use control surfaces (no movement) to make small holes for clearence
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:35:08 you can do this
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:36:39 
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 03:38:15 wait, that affects the c.o.m even tho its should be the same?
creations-chat 2021-06-06 04:35:20 this look good for the f105?
creations-chat 2021-06-06 04:42:27 thanks for reply, imma try 1x3 or 2

creations-chat 2021-06-06 04:56:46 my version is prob different proportion than yours, but thanks for offering me help, i might need it
creations-chat 2021-06-06 05:01:43 already this look crappy, imma take nap now
creations-chat 2021-06-06 06:53:00 barrel can use unbinded cameras instead of trails


-<@!441125486312030221> this wing looks good for f105?
creations-chat 2021-06-06 06:56:03 i think the gen 3 plane engineers thinking big brain when slapping that intake on the f105, since its similar shape on the f35, somewhat


-<@!441125486312030221> thanks for feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-06 06:58:48 so far the only thing that concerned me the most is the sharp af nose on the f104, in which i have to copy from another bloke's
creations-chat 2021-06-06 07:02:27 this channel is testing and training everyone's sodium tolerance level bit by bit

i like it, but this is feedback tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:09:39 its a flying toaster
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:12:44 i love the gen 3 engineer's ideology of SPEED
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:13:35 i dont think the f18 can do that, but it did trade speed for service life so, yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:14:22 what does thrust to weight ration mean tho, i still dont understand
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:15:08 this is like strapping a rocket engine to a glider
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:15:26 but yes, why not they say
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:16:08 keeping as much energy as possible for each maneuver?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:17:26 but it was designed to be fast rocket platform ....
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:18:08 my plane losses 200 speed trying to roll, but it has 650 in the pocket so whatever i guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:18:50 stall horns?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:19:22 same goes for my pen lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:19:49 airbrakes and flaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:20:12 then make one
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:21:41 or, you can add this thing to plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:22:01 but it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:22:54 one time i see a ju 87's airbrakes are just 1x4 wing panels twisting 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:23:25 its more of custom, but dunno how you see its a harrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:24:53 0_0, wut, i think the bandonhokoros worth of coke bottles strap onto plane mislead your vision, its nothing alike lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:25:49 you got expert yet?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:26:29 add more rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:26:52 you can never have enough rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:27:44 thats fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:29:30 i wanna slap hover drives onto my f104 instead of rocket spam
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:29:50 but outdated 2013 laptop is bottleneck
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:30:25 dunno how to use lol, and magnets freaks the plane out
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:30:38 i got caped by equipment, sad
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:32:36 i think imma retain myself at 650 for now, cuz papa laptop dont like it when me exceed speed in large creation, he had lotta seizures before, most resulted in crashes
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:34:05 i dont like it when them seizures turn into mild coma
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:36:19 good for you, cuz im stuck with the *once* flagship of a laptop of 2013, that meant there is less upgrades i can do, so yeah, i will remain slow as ever and be pray to shredders
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:37:14 i dont like my laptop having a coma becuz i attempt to be fast man
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:38:26 10 fps drop
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:38:50 it dont shake, but game slows my plane down below true speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 07:40:09 i cant reach high speed, high true speed that is, beucz 4gb ram said no

bug-reports 2021-06-06 08:13:03 for some reason, plane shakes violently when i place wing panels extending out of the plot
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 08:13:58 whats the plane tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 08:15:04 so ifkin is building a formation, is that right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 08:16:06 i see lads just build planes smaller than 200 blocks to avoid pain, how big was each plane ifkin was planning for
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 08:16:53 activate the big brain, this would turn your build into the realm of multifold creation
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 08:18:22 mini-miner?

help 2021-06-07 14:47:54 What are the tips to make a helicopter? Mine is just a plane with a large rotor slap on
help 2021-06-07 14:50:12 My design don’t really need the rotors spinning or anything, so it doesn’t reap much benefits of a helicopter
help 2021-06-07 14:50:30 Also it big and clumsy, also kinda ugly
creations-chat 2021-06-07 14:51:26 It’s an original idea, cheese
creations-chat 2021-06-07 14:56:15 The man’s U2 ain’t look like a U2, at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:58:18 Or that he copying
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:02:37 The times I bring a U2 to bomb “death” cars and running away with it is unreal
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:03:27 I usually faced Chinese gamers tho, they be pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:04:49 My arrangement of bombs is basically bomb being placed side by side along the U2’s wing length lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:10:46 I think lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:11:52 I think it exploded
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:12:14 How tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:13:40 Yeah, I think lag and performance
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:14:07 Sometimes while firing 20 missile from my missile rig, 5 just froze up
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:15:14 Even with only 15 rods, it’s still enough to evaporate a whole plot
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 15:16:37 Place hover engine

help 2021-06-13 02:06:40 so you just end up rotating to one side?
help 2021-06-13 02:08:12 a hint is that you make those prop fake, so it doesnt tilt as much
help 2021-06-13 02:08:38 or you can just make biplane, it tends to cope better with the problem

creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:00:07 The thing is, it deforms so much, there can’t be any constructive feedback to be made to correct plane to original blueprint, might as well be custom jet made by the average new player
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:03:54 By the looks of the jet, it appears to be an attempt to replicate a mig of some sort, if you do so, type that model into search, add phrase “sketchfab” then investigate your confusion compared to the original plane
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:10:07 Sorry for not responding to your feedback earlier, and thanks for feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:12:22 I’m beginning to question if the average chad’s of the Pcc is actually just undes gaming more intense than medic gaming can

creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:28:58 but it works, thats the point of the camo

what i meant was, in pcc, the only reason of a camo is to make plane look "better", what i thought of was an effective color scheme that doesnt look too bland, and conceals a plane during dogfight, we can just copy real life camo into creations and such anytime so, why not?
creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:33:28 why is it in japanese tho

general 2021-06-16 03:55:33 or, add an option where you increase render distance without adding more details and such
general 2021-06-16 03:56:47 what happened, i dont know wt too well
general 2021-06-16 03:57:45 so, say a b17 against the harrier's cancer missile?
general 2021-06-16 04:03:24 how tho, he do ground attack?
general 2021-06-16 04:03:58 woah, skill
general 2021-06-16 04:04:40 how about you banzai them, air to air ***plane***

help 2021-06-16 10:39:08 how to increase roll rate and reduce energy loss for planes when doing maneuvers?
help 2021-06-16 10:41:54 this is the plane that has those problems, how to fix those (not looking to improve looks)
help 2021-06-16 10:46:51 dont ask the biplane me 262
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:08:26 how do you reduce energy loss when performing maneuvers on a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:09:17 ._.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:11:10 you can just go to <#478584971670454284>  and see the dissapointment i built, it also suffers from poor roll rate
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:13:00 i guess i could just reduce wing panels
help 2021-06-16 11:13:38 long nose
help 2021-06-16 11:16:13 k, lets hope i dont receive low fps during the fast
help 2021-06-16 11:31:00 plane now flies faster after i make wing dihedral, which removes the need for wing stacking (wing stacking was to fix c.o.l problem, dihedral wings also solves that)
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:35:48 i wonder if you include wing panels into the thrust vectoring to increase maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:36:20 die?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:37:04 i knew that, just thought that it would ruin your f22, cuz the nozzles are different
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:40:41 fixed roll rate issue by trying to improve looks lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:40:51 third hand
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:41:01 i meant limb

trust me that it does have a torpedo
creations-chat 2021-06-17 15:52:09 how tho, in this state of pandemic development
creations-chat 2021-06-17 15:57:29 damn goodness your good, we are living in a hell hole of a new outburst
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:07:35 torpedo bomber, what to improve on?
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:10:43 can i have feedbacks from yall german speaking mates rambling about the general pcc experience?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:12:32 "maneuverability and kills and air superiority"
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:12:59 crap, i accidentally do that, welp
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:14:25 dunno why people dont build something more exotic like the century series planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:14:32 f104 for example
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:15:01 ._.
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:15:37 hide cheese graters or custom?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:16:17 i really wish we could do sick moves like stalling mid air too make enemy overshoot
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:16:55 its how i improve at building in general
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:17:16 i cant think of an original idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:18:38 i have the superior plane, the better armament, rockets set in a way that is hard to miss, motorlocking, and yet i cant beat my nub friend with a flying tank with a tall ass rocket turret placed on top cuz he kept pulling up
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:18:45 ***SHAME***
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:20:07 plane in the left is the incarnation of his skills, sharp wings, bad shape
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:20:22 i feel the burn
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:21:12 turret with rockets on is only as good as ground harrassment
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:22:12 damn, you cant say hes bad at the game in terms of leading shots
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:22:45 i mean, this is my heli??
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:23:31 its just a "i want those ***d***" heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:24:00 ugh, helium user
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:24:55 put more wings to balance out, thats how i transform this into the heli your suffering from
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:25:22 you can just see the dna
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:25:53 i just balance my heli so that c.o.l and c.o.m is closer
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:27:01 you need to make the nose starting from the front end of the wings longer if you want those proportions of a wing
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:27:32 ? mine?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:28:04 so you be giving him the pics?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:28:10 plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:28:21 oh no
general 2021-06-18 00:57:28 rickje hiring the chads 😮
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:03:12 any tips to ensure the best ground-harassment-capability for a helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:04:08 when you build tutorials, that means you dont think when you build them, you lost your soul while watching people build for you
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:07:39 cuz theres really no other distinct alternatives to a sandbox + physics simulation game like plane crazy, i think, feel free to correct me
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:10:34 the kind of complexity you find in mc is very different that what you find here
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:16:24 tutorials that documents, illustrate how you should use a specific tool, a way to build is perfectly fine, theres no problem with that
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:17:37 thats a point of tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:17:47 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:18:08 you dont continue that person's technological development
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:18:18 you build from scratch
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:18:48 look what happened to pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:18:58 i just joined
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:25:40 how to improve building in plane crazy:
- build any thing with a clear goal (preferably with real life references)
-use you ability to think to correct creation's problem (movement, looks)
-post it onto pcc
-get pummled with words and such 
-retrieve the responses
-profit
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:13 thats how i learn, thats for sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:31 plane crazy community
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:37 mmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:40:29 X 29
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:41:13 4 fold build?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:41:28 ah
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:29:31 max speed builds being anchored?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:30:53 hoverdrive builds like my u.a.v i assume goes fast, but becomes stupid slow when rolling, rotating, it still makes rockets go fast tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:31:11 lemme test
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:31:56 "uav"
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:35:08 nah, its not the case
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:36:00 anchor doesnt allow you to still do the increase fireworks range even at max hoverdrive
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 02:36:07 LOL
general 2021-06-18 03:00:26 what happend here
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:01:37 me 262, what to fix?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:03:13 top down angle?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:03:34 
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:05:08 this? what about it?
general 2021-06-18 03:07:38 you gotta prepare for the toxic waste land that is pcc, amirite?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:08:31 you can add more area (make ship bigger with less inside)
general 2021-06-18 03:09:03 never knew that...
general 2021-06-18 03:09:28 holy potatoes
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:10:27 if you do that, ship is more prone to capsize, remember to reinforce your ship's bottom with ballast
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:14:37 im gonna post something bad + cringe in <#384025409945337856>  , and receive the roast along with the feedbacks, cuz i dont know how i can get feedbacks
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:17:19 oh yeah, the downvotes are coming in
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:19:54 ._. but like, how do i make plane from nub of nubs to mediocre?
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:22:38 but like, how do you fix the exposed lock that sits on top of thin wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:23:27 aye bois, i need feedbacks for my trash plane in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:24:56 uhm any suggestions? also the wings tilt so cant exactly do that
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:29:11 hmm, i might need to think more to fix this
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:33:36 those are great responses, i value you time and effort to pinpoint the things that disgusts you
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:37:58 so:
-cockpit needs rework
-cheese graters
-re think on arranging armament
-back yaw control need hiding
-the nose is long

and:
-wings + rear + vertical stabilisers okay?
-engine design okay?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:39:20 might as well crash him
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:39:42 or his plane became thristy and drinks the water
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:41:41 it would be poggers if you confirm the list i make is alike your thought on me plane, in any case, i thank your detailed feedbacks and your reccomendation to restart the building
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:42:26 basically world war but theres only 1 country vs the world
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:44:13 this unfinished chopping board will be my sacrificed, i will try my best to build a less scuffed version
creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:46:54 nah like, the chopping board is structurally finished, its just very bad looking n unfinished paint, also a non pvp build
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 03:55:54 never thought the me 262 would look this chonkus
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:04:10 It’s not a wip tho...
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:06:35 Now you have seen a 262, in white
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 04:50:07 He said the word, mmm, bad man
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:08:01 Well, thanks, the idea of crammed control surfaces seem interesting enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:21:13 yo , anyone have a good x 29 test plane 3d model?
i cant find any in sketch fab
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:30:31 pls bois
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:31:33 now i have to use this scuffed 3d model
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:33:11 i dont need to buy it, but it gives less freedom than sketchfab can
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:37:38 get yourself milktea
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:56:27 superfluous
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:58:54 this x-29 gonna turn out like shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 07:59:35 your in a dive, that aint average speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:01:33 there it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:17:50 yes?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:18:43 what happend?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:20:24 so... how is my half assed attempt at angle locked (or sth idk i never did that) cockpit?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:22:28 tell me how i did, this experimental plane is unironically my experiment of adding more custom aspects
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:25:33 wut
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:27:53 woah, trapdoor for plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:28:24 how is me attempt at custom cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:28:32 also:
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:07 dunno what you gain from an assumed weightless plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:17 ruins the plane's dive
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:53 yooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:03:15 this good yet?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:07:37 less insides?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:38:25 yes?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:43:50 surprisingly the plane is more stable at high speeds than my me 262
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:37:00 wut?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:38:41 you need to cleanse yourself from the high from heights, its just a very big ailerons
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:38:54 ea sports
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:39:07 ._.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:39:49 k, that would need experiment to ensure both modes doesnt affect stability
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:52:16 i have bad news
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:52:23 the concept got robloxed
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 11:09:22 he naughty

creations-chat 2021-06-18 12:36:33 a plane inspired by x 29, feedbacks are welcomed
creations-chat 2021-06-18 12:39:56 i actually have to search the word "anorexic" lul
aight, i can fix those stuff, it would be nice tho if you can provide me a 3d model of the x 29, cuz i cant find one
creations-chat 2021-06-18 12:42:29 those will do, thanks
creations-chat 2021-06-19 02:21:59 the only way to verify is to demonstrate such's knowledge through pictures
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:23:45 i remeber you have the sauces
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:23:54 sell him the sauces
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:24:12 ._.
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:24:29 you even ask that question, holy moly
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:24:50 idk, ask his "aspirations"
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:35:24 less exposed (excpet the obvious one to angle the cockpit) how did i do and how to improve?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:36:23 aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:38:43 how is it now?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 02:39:01 b u i l d  one

creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:35:48 plane shakes quite violently during intensive maneuver, do you know how to fix problem?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:37:53 so, motorlock more vertical stabilizers? 
also, what do you mean by decrease drag?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:39:55 what affect does 2 delta wings give to 1 normal wing panel (2 delta wing to fill up holes)

also, wing is 6 blocks long, and i use delta wing 1x4, so....
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:44:39 i heard some other people saying that i should increase wings "volume" (increasing wing size ruins proportions) to reduce shaking on some build (mini cruise missile travelling at 300 speed shakes stupid strokes, adding more wings seem to solve problem), so in what case should i perform the motorlock of 2 delta instead of 1 normal wing panel?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 01:45:42 must add 10 missiles per truck

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:45:47 alternatively, it can use it's specially designed yaw control of basically deploying flaps at the far end of one end of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:46:35 you are fine with clay models i must say

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:03:45 there must be a pivot for the plane to pitch on
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:04:25 im pretty sure very bad pitch control without using engines for it
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:05:01 question, mmm

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:22:52 wobble at high speed or standing still?
general 2021-06-21 01:23:11 what that game?
general 2021-06-21 01:23:47 why isnt rickje representing game
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:24:04 add more wings to stabilise
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:24:21 preferably different position
general 2021-06-21 01:25:14 thats a demand for you are an ultimatum to us?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 01:27:17 i think that plane wobbles because there arent equal forces acting on the plane, motorlocking more wings onto main wing does less effect cuz, its applying force closer to pivot point
then again, this is plane crazy, and game engine usually said to me: go fuck yourself so..
general 2021-06-21 01:28:01 
general 2021-06-21 01:29:38 2 warns just for that, wow

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:05:25 after this ship is done, i might attempt to build an auto loader system for the mk 45 turret you often see on many ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:12:08 aeronautical is pretty hard when you try to get aero 4 and above, since it results in big airliner, a bomber, or a really detailed plane to reach that block requirement, i think

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 02:15:49 yaaayy

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:45:37 like molecular vibrations
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:46:02 hover cause more lag, but it doesnt vibrates the plane as much
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:46:44 hoverdrive, not hover engine

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:30:52 Welcome to the land of domination
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:34:11 The person controlling shredders and stuff nowadays are just brainded children with no love given to them from parents trying to find a piece of joy from killing, they are not impressive pvp-ers
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:35:44 Then be faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:35:52 It’s not hard to be fast
creations-chat 2021-06-30 08:37:51 <@456226577798135808>  that’s an usually thick b52, thing’s wingspan is larger than b36, which is a beast itself

Now that it’s within eyesight, it’s looks very mediocre, not b52 like
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:40:19 How long it takes you to demonstrate your mechanism lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:41:33 My trash me262 that can’t track with mouse very well can slap most stuff out of the air lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:42:10 I meant vid length

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:20:09 all they need to do is just to designed an engine that is developer friendly, with minature bugs, others are just comsetics changes, it no matter

they screw both up, i think :LL

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:21:53 ah, "***F***" to you

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:26:29 holy, wait wut?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:27:25 the extent i go against them is calling them dishwashers ( maybe too much lul), but not targeting a single group to harm them

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:28:14 i can call them sandwich makers if you like me to :L

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:43:57 we should give out links that redirects viewers back to the original content creators
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:44:25 or, they can just do it to seem more legit :L

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 09:13:18 why is casual pvp so brainded
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 09:14:34 its not hard to build something that ressembles a plane that can do stuff with eas
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 09:18:36 im bored of playing plane crazy now, visualising the ship's stern kills me inside, imm mess around with rgb settings
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:04:50 imagine an air to air weapon that, when used, drops a big fat net that anchors itself on the air, catching the enemy aircraft, then explode the net
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:05:40 you go do it, your spaceship dont care about aerodynamics anyway :L
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:06:17 damn, your heavy :DD
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:06:44 what was the convo about anyway, they kept talking like training and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:07:48 last time i did that, i was sitting on my heli and broadcasting fortunate sons in the form of lead at the normies, they all died
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:08:27 maganets
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:08:47 physical locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:10:05 the other time i sweat is when im in my 262 and kept strafing enemies with salvos and bullets, it dont track with mouse well
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:12:49 the only time i sweat now is when my tring to combat competent shredder with high agility, cuz casual pvp is pretty ez if i say so myself
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:14:19 the what?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:14:48 they laggy af

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:17:44 now i just gotta add camo and fix the freaking stern of my destroyer to hopefully please the chaps of pcc
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:18:47 dunno why he cant use ball and socket kind of joints to insert the pieces like wooden bricks onto eachother and anchor them, unless he wanna move a multi save build
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:21:26 i think imma exit the doucheland faction or sth, nothing really interesting happens there
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:21:49 nah wait, its germany in german
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:22:16 bruh what
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:45:22 gamer lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:58:34 i replaced 2 bouncy bombs on my plane with 2 extra torps
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:58:58 bouncy bombs not good for dive bomb
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:59:06 sad
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:01:20 tri torp gaming
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:02:02 to cause maximum warcrimes
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:02:30 vent holes
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:03:23 im quite surprise at how tight the torps are, with little spread
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:04:40 ifkin gets shot down, what sadge
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:05:06 or shot up
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:07:10 oh gee, snifing like a dog on twitter
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 01:31:10 spicy nose
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:40:36 goldensword and his technologically superior combat brick terrorising us mentally
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:42:44 this looks familiar
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:27:07 shitty camo
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:27:59 tried to make the camo overlap into the superstructure, should i do it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:28:43 imma paint muh ship brighter ig
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:28:55 just the grey part

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:30:46 nah shit, how to add texture to side of ship, thats ez, and not shitty
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:31:05 i tried adding this camo lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:31:56 believe me when i said this morning i joined one with 2 shredder ball and a shredder swarm
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:35:56 Naval camo is different than traditional camo, they work by confusing the eyes of the range finder, thus they gave off false heading and range, they kinda useless when up against modern radar
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:37:35 Turret almost have 180 degree turn from bow point, damn that’s curse
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:41:51 Im gonna try the og camo, but without all the superstructure parts, that sucks hard
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:45:50 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:46:05 Now you can split screen and feel superior
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:46:28 Screen time, what cringe
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:48:17 Why don’t they just make big flat map
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:49:30 Dunno how tank battles would look like when suspension brokes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:43 Why you want to make anything that can be called a ship, flies
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:51:33 Imagine something called a sweaty ship battle, it sounds strange af
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:53:23 Other day some chad named battleship_man flying around in his 10k blocks carrier with “ocean man” written on the deck
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:54:05 Can see why he called my ship and other kid’s ship bad
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:54:42 Flies faster than 500 I remember
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:54:58 It melted the child’s setup

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:36:58 incase you are wondering why tail looks so weird, its cuz the body was borrowed from my other f105, yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:44:46 should i do the funny cheese graters to do this vent thingy?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:45:40 ooo, how that works, fixing the aerodynamics?
general 2021-07-02 13:53:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:58:47 its f105, but yes, becuz starting from somewhere then refining it is much better
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:59:13 ***refining***

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:12:46 my U2 does the stalling part well, can stall but not lose altitude at around 60 speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:13:41 is it a flying brick?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:13:59 just, engines over lift?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:14:15 thats too little
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:14:24 add like 6 to 10 more
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:15:19 when your plane reaches like 400, you know that its good
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:15:39 breh, cant throttle your engine
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:16:38 gib picture, you have image perms
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:17:44 why is cockpit so flat, like a panel riveted perpendicular to the nose?

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:18:55 imma go
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:27:21 Super rocket is best thrust to weight propulsion, you don’t need to care about weight
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:30:26 Your just bad at the center of lift, center of mass thing really, my plane flies decently fast (550) yet I can shift lock and still keep altitude
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 14:33:34 Not really a biplane tho, but okay
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:07:34 Build it from a tube, trust me
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:09:41 Take a look at the b29, the b36, the b47, b50 doesn’t count cuz it’s just a bigger b29, b52

They are all tubes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:11:26 Eh, it’s the way it is
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 15:13:18 I see a b2 with it’s edges painted red and blue
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 01:44:40 And if that don’t work, use more gun
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 03:07:51 All you need is trump’s wall and Karen’s funny to make yourself an adequate obstacle course

creations-chat 2021-07-08 11:30:53 I’m being attacked and used as a battleground like fucking Vietnam, chill guys this is feedbacks, why was it shitty, point the details out
general 2021-07-08 11:31:33 Special equates to spice
general 2021-07-08 11:31:40 That was my thinking
creations-chat 2021-07-08 11:39:04 Red wasn’t default but i guess it’s still too bright, oops
The only thing that isn’t offscale is the nose part, but then again the whole plane is stupid large and fixing scaling is a difficult task, might as well call it a custom build since I’m using it for bombing like a true lad, not chad

<@!718006867808485447>  I still didn’t know how to check the creation’s scaling accuracy compared to 2d blueprints, the way I build is to recreate a specific detail of a creation one by one, which might result in enlargement (in this case, very obvious) or miscaling, which sucks

From this point on, I’m might just finish up the jet with some other bits, thanks for your (both of you) constructive feedbacks
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 12:00:58 ah, good to know roblox agrees that my plane sucks

creations-chat 2021-07-10 01:19:26 What was noise

creations-chat 2021-07-10 02:14:01 poor you guys
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:35:08 the other day there is extreme thicc big robot (i think gundam, but i might be wrong) zooping around at mach 2, crashing into people
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:35:42 its in pvp, and not like his shots always connect, but it was real annoyance cuz you cant shut him down
creations-chat 2021-07-10 03:36:36 show the thing that makes people say thicc
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:36:59 jet is always for cosmetic
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:46:56 its not that they are shit, its just super rockets are too good
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:51:03 yeah, they do look cool with the fan blades tho
creations-chat 2021-07-10 05:23:32 very nice gun system mate
general 2021-07-10 05:24:52 but why they wanna explore early tho
creations-chat 2021-07-10 05:50:24 i think that there is a way i can use your design (rammer attached to the part the moves the rounds from vertical to horizontal) and incoporate it into mine, ofc that is if i have your permission
creations-chat 2021-07-10 11:21:43 how can you make your entire system not wobble so much during loading, when i demonstrate my iteration of a loading system the entire thing just wobbles around which really affects the performance of the loading phase
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 11:23:46 press the "toggle" button on for the motor 2
when spawn your turret will not follow your mouse, by pressing the binded key you will be able to toggle on/off floowing your mouse
creations-chat 2021-07-10 11:24:11 🙂
cool

i think i can just dispose the loading tube for the rotary drum and see how that do
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 11:27:50 long rod of trails set to lowest lifetime ig
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 11:28:43 its kinda hard to do except some stupid motor piston shenanigans
creations-chat 2021-07-10 11:31:08 superstructure is indeed too long or too shallow, looks smooth like the submarine's superstructure

you either shorten the superstructure by some amount to make space, or add a mast or sth
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 11:31:42 they are real small, people might not know
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 11:33:59 he want conceal the blade when not using, which is hard unless he use motors
creations-chat 2021-07-10 11:36:25 i can send an example of my yet to be detailed ship, to give you a perspective

plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:31:30 50. cal machine gun basically counters ERA
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:32:10 actually it basically counters most other armour
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:32:56 thought it was just to explode against the projectile
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:33:31 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:33:56 dont speak magic to me ya wizard
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:34:38 i think spaced armour and rails can counter that
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:35:40 HESH op
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:36:36 that wont work if you have same height
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:37:08 spaced armour turns Hesh into shrapnel tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 13:37:30 at the cose of losing the entirety of the spaced armour

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:08:17 very
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:12:18 if we could get the amount of <#504436696021204992> 's excitement to turn into actual feedbacks, then there wouldnt have been any cancer heads remaining in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:13:36 we should make arguments channel to free feedbacks tbh
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:14:35 i dont want to see <#504436696021204992> to be filled with poopoo when we needed it the most for correction
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:15:41 oh yeah, where should i improve my bomber on next :DD
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:16:25 i should remove that tbh lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:17:06 the guns were to serve as meme gunship variant, proven pretty effective lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:17:47 mmm, define enough, i dont got 2 years of continous pain looking at feedbacks to extract the needed
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:18:43 i cant build small, that is my most detrimental ***skill issue***
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:19:10 my f14 is bigger than my bomber in terms of block count
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:20:49 basically, i cant build small
-> i cant effectively add details

my learning techniques sucks
-> my ways of building is primitive, which leads to scarce space
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:21:00 i can, but it is not effective
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:22:18 also, i cant look at a build and slice them up to different anglelock/motorlock modules like chads :v
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:22:28 im still pretty new to pc lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:22:56 me and my lizard brain

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:27:35 i think my builds just now falls into thee region of "its bad but so good we cant give specific feedbacks so just git gud"
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 17:29:28 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:18:15 Bomb door, which is quite significant i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:18:27 That’s a sketch:L
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:20:11 The *old* jesko looks like it was made to understand how to implement certain elements, to try out ideas more than an actual build, it’s like a playground if that helps
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:21:11 Hmm, interesting
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:22:19 I’m still quite surprised the newer plane did worse
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:22:41 Oh well, expert aero gotta wait I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:23:22 When I build is bigger, people will expect more details and such
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:31:35 Do I have to fix the plane’s fuselage  cross section, which might potentially ruins some current favorable flight characteristics?

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 14:41:31 basically, i might consider this since newest plane does not meet the score requirement, why the older version does not meet the block count

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:45:13 although macro should be set at like 0.75 interval so to be effective AA
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:46:25 if rockets all missed, thats gone be deepshit since you gotta wait for reload

creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:32:51 You could just use locked motor 1 and keybinds as well as a protruding structure to set a specific angle, for me it seems easier
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:35:05 No it’s not lol, it’s just that you spam builds in creation, as well as lack of paint variations, and not sufficient use of motorlock
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:01:18 Angle tha back jet engines, also fix the roughness issue of the main body
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 14:02:39 You should chill, he is the person you would find most helpful in identifying your shortcomings
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:04:24 Hate to say this but, the whole thing, whenever there’s random protrusion, it is considered as rough

Especially fix the section from the main body to the neck, that looks dumb

creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:12:05 The normal everyday case of us gold people giving harsh feedbacks to the newer player base and they got mad and rage on why it doesn’t look that bad, usually it’s cuz we have high standards (not me, I’m still hot shit), or that the new player’s confidence in their build is far from the base standards of **good** in the community

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 08:08:40 More wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 08:09:52 With more stubby wings, you can control your heli better since it essentially limits your pitching, which would be easier to control, alternatively, it is tail heavy, so add weight on nose
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 08:10:39 Chill, you can work this out yourself, I’m not a better heli builder anyways
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 08:11:07 Ballast

creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:33:04 dont you think it looks a little plain?

fine, add weathering effect if you dont want people gushing about your uninspiring hull
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 03:43:50 some guy copies plain train (no offence)
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:45:02 you drunk?

you could borrow destroyer's camo since its easier that way
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:49:52 if it didnt have camo, you can use any ship's camo for that matter
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:54:28 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/866962385100079165 this ship is trash, the hull is made in prehistoric time of me, yet the camo, saved it from being dunked, so it's your choice of camo, or small little black circles and complex box geometry to break apart the plain looking hull

<@!414998453962145792> i literally linked my ship, what
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:57:24 mine, my ship is trash, bow is funny
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:59:51 i learned angle lock recently, so now i look at my builds very differently
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:02:43 add small rim line with different colours
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:10:01 looking at this angle, i can see the rims and the complex geometry a dreadnought can have, you should add in those complex geometry, cuz your hull be looking blank
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:17:35 im not saying you must you angle locks, im saying you should add more details besides the black holes to the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:19:47 ***rims***

i said rims earlier before, damn, just look at your model and ponder
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:22:18 you see the white line on the model's hull?

yeah, thats the rim
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:56:01 i think you should finish the whole ship before further detailing

wait for cooldown, and im not telling you to stop, its just that you didnt really get my idea of how to improve
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:58:21 the white part on the hull is the rims
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 04:59:11 weird afterburner
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:00:56 you see how the hull is not smooth and flat?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 05:01:48 awake hars
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 05:02:28 you dont say that
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 05:05:24 fard
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:06:19 theres no good 3d model of the ship lol
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:09:09 oh well, fuck it, rims is small insignificant detail anyway
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:12:50 if you look at the hull from this angle, you see boxes, geometry that sticks out and goes in, of the hull, just look at the right side of the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:19:38 yeah, said so
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:22:44 yeah, but its not that apparent
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:24:57 no not the red part, its the gray part i was talking about
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:32:36 i have e
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:34:48 individual fencing that curves

<@456226577798135808> pretty hard from those angles to see since the **rims** detail ive been gushing about is only ever visible when you look at a ship head on or you look at it between the side-top view angle, but i'll do circle the area that ove been saying
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:38:21 the individual lines that appears on that side is the best illustration of what i can muster out of this pic

<@!541089825428602915> its on the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:41:30 now i have to build what i meant cuz no good 3d model exist bruv

this is the kind of detail i want to see on your ship, sorry if i did, which i did, cause a mess in feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:57:20 5 inch smaller
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:59:36 well yes, as long as it breaks the plainess of the hull

fuck it, imma build dreadnought style ship since i started on the angled hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 06:05:58 weld lines are very hard to angle since small hitbox and less of an option, i also want custom angled so have to do that

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 02:04:50 :0
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 02:05:10 That’s when you demonstrate your cloak technology to him in creations

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:46:52 <@!702590900852883683>  recently you made an AH-1, which i very much like, currently im making that same choper, ofc not copying you

so anyway, how do you make the heli not spin out of control when changing the pitch angle of rotor blades?
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:47:12 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:47:57 some guy said jut use unpowered motors, that somewhat works until i pitch
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:48:25 shit
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:49:07 time to do un epik guessing gaming where i experiment tail rotor angle
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:49:28 un less i use math to counteract properly, but brain melts in summer
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:52:29 wait, i think i got someway to solve it, rudimentarily
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:53:27 but since plane crazy is an epik physics simulation game with benchmarking performance, this might not be so accurate
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:54:34 wow, it raining hard here
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 03:54:49 also, SR said he likely sleeps to 12 am lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:35:27 not known here lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:35:58 i think theres like one other guy that post it in creations, in a time where motorlock and anglelock is not common yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:36:29 the very definition of a bomber fighter
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:36:39 why D:

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:44:35 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:46:24 by building the wing tips with deltas in build mode to make up for that reduce of angle
creations-chat 2021-07-23 10:56:46 i somehow cant make it work, lotta game mechanics i still dont know of lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:57:06 wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:57:13 i meant delta
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:57:24 ah, good
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 10:58:43 i won a fight against a shredder in my bomber
creations-chat 2021-07-23 10:59:32 wow, that sucks then
creations-chat 2021-07-23 11:18:40 guys help, i got called out as tutorial user (no am not, im just nub) and i did this funny shit

no like, how do you control your helis?
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:29:16 https://streamable.com/6xnebg i dont fucking know anymore, that short movement uses 3 fingers
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:30:10 the ball camera thingy too hard to make, me ditch idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:31:24 it was supposed to be ah1 viper, but yeah somehow looks like that
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:31:37 oh well
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:32:56 a
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 11:54:30 i made heli worked, just gotta polish and do some more stuff
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:01:13 what happening here
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:04:06 e
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:06:39 swashplate allows individual rotors to tilt up or down, which allows helis it's movement, not the ability to rotate the rotor blades to change ascend and descend speed
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:08:55 dogshit ability to tilt the whole rotor set, heli still can do basic movements, h
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:16:04 heli, what should i improve on?

other than than the core mechanism ofc, that causes pain
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:16:54 lemme see your progress, you can find mine in feedbacks
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:18:59 <@!757887014388367401>  i like your enthusiasm, a feedback i would give is to use more colours

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:19:55 on the other hand, i did the rims canopy thingy :DD

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:27:52 wow you
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:28:14 body would be like 2 block tall cuz the rotors are so
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:31:42 muh heli uses real shitty swashplate crap thingy to move tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:32:36 thats why i add crap thingy
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:33:08 smh, adding 2.5 to ballast makes heli moves forward better, but cant hover
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:35:04 1 block wide is a thin heli tbh
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:39:22 that thing dont even have swashplate thingy stuff (rigid heli rotors)
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:41:26 https://streamable.com/08xgv2 i did the funny
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:43:10 my heli have like 4 different sets of keybind for movement lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:53:11 wot is now
general 2021-07-24 09:53:34 oh wat?
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:55:00 theres R+F for rotor angle
E+Q for controlling the pitch of the rotor and heli
A+D for rolling of heli 
Z+X for usage of tail rotor for yaw control
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:55:18 me?
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:56:00 i mean, it works
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:56:29 oh yeah, w+s for rotor speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:56:48 maximum ergonomics gaming
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:57:15 angle lock gaming
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 09:57:47 or, this

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:09:42 US needs to cut it's fat military spending cost
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:10:46 F14 in it's core is still a potent fighter

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:21:04 f14 is still better than f18 in air supremacy i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:23:50 apparently britain built their carriers around f35b
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:24:14 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:24:32 will drones be better at dogfight tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:25:21 f4 is still in service in japan i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 14:27:17 in that iraq war where the entire world battles against one country, lotta drones where launch to act as bait i think

creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:40:30 white seems too overwhelming for me to see, if you can, tone it down by 5-10 every value, other than that, plane looks cool
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:44:38 if its a mechanical demonstration, build it as a mechanical demonstration, you are building a plane, in which we cant exactly know your **abilities** on such plane, we take a look at it and judge such creation from style and look, as well as miniature details, i would like to see you build a better plane with design put forward

<@!541155734382182412> thanks lad
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:46:51 i cant make it what you are making, therefore i cant say if that creation, or something i dont know, is enough

plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:20:50 no yaw control props
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:28:08 the requirement doesn't need you to demonstrate taxi ability, just full yaw, pitch, roll in the air
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:29:17 use yaw control of rudder, or add motor to landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:37:52 i have no pvp able plane that matches pcc's level of pro in combat
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:38:20 it doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:47:27 finally, a good looking
creations-chat 2021-07-25 07:49:20 i finished the basic geometry for the plane to be recognisable as a f15 (or other plane, im building off of the f15)

is there anything i should fix besides from exposed?
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:49:25 f15
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 07:51:24 yay

plane-crazy 2021-07-26 02:15:35 without the thrust vectoring ofc
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 02:17:21 its ok, decent
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 02:39:32 you know the most annoying part is that the more skilled you are, the lest feedbacks you can get cuz theres not alot more people who can recreate a detail or some stuff

what i need in feedbacks is just a different perspective on a build to point out the flaws lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 02:41:29 the only ever feedbacks i got now is from the harsh high standards experts :L

at least their words arent as bad as i first start out

creations-chat 2021-07-26 06:48:07 motors are locked?

the ones connecting into the circled motors

motor 2s arent that great for angle locking since they arent locked, meaning that they will spazed out
creations-chat 2021-07-26 06:52:59 you could use cameras to make a specific angle (build cameras sticks outwards of the details as well as the base)
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 06:56:56 i think what i would try to do now is to reduce the number of exposed locks since theres nothing much you can add with a small plane
creations-chat 2021-07-26 06:59:34 impressive rockets and accuracy, as well as minimal fall off, props to that

creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:41:52 the pvp skill falls into a curve similar that of the bell

you have the most nubs, guns and shredders, very unfun

you have the average joe, capable of using rockets for carnage

then you have super pro who learned to use hyperdrives, so only practical way is gun

plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:21:20 i think that it is okay to leave it that way, also, fix the tail
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:21:28 
creations-chat 2021-07-31 14:23:08 i cant exactly hide the exposed locks anymore, should i add in a layer of halfblocks to conceal it? <@!719168864705052802>

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:46:49 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:47:14 Don’t think it would be needed
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:47:47 Texture the flight deck also
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:49:06 I don’t think trails do that much to landing
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:49:29 Motorlock wing panels?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:49:56 That is usually how people would paint flight deck
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:50:05 But why
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:51:40 Wow you
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:44 But it’s a spaceship  that launches extra large Phoenix missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:57:07 F104 is pen
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:57:26 The back do be looking kinda flat
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:58:26 Apfsds rocket
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:01:32 That would be the f117
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:06 It’s not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:38 Piston lock is still a bitch ass...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:58 Can’t make piston lock viable for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:07:20 I learned angle lock by myself, it hit like a truck loaded with crack
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:07:48 Deal with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:08:03 Me angle locking 2 blocks :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:09:07 Do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:09:13 Do the anglelock
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:10:57 Ye have to wait for sometime for the lock to be stable to collapse lock tower
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:11:30 I did it all the time, but it still is a downside
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:12:29 I think I can land my U2
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:09:57 ah yes, yamato

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:32:54 i think suspension bounces due to sudden movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:33:09 i should add weight and see what happens :L

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:30:14 okay, copy as you will
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:31:05 yeah, there is extra cockpit, theres also a variant for the sr71 buts its for training
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:31:27 nose is to accomodate the radar
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:32:19 all the recon payload where swapped out (there were 4 bays), 1 for weapon system, and 3 others for large missile
general 2021-08-04 09:33:01 wots that
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:34:08 not really, the development isnt too costly, since there was the already existing version that is the a12, apart from different nose and front part, plane is still very similar to a12
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:34:41 then again, vietnam war came out, russian bombers aint gonna exist and the real threat is from the bushes

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:30:28 they sucked
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:32:24 you wanna know something?

high lag ruins angle locks
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:32:29 very shid
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:34:40 i remembered enjoying pc, although with low amount of skill

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:38:27 i know for the fact that my build is a clusterfuck of i dont know what, its still not an excuse to be having this anglelock problem

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:49:22 no like, the yf12 has some more serious anglelocks than the f14
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:49:27 and somehow less blocks

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:58:55 no you
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:59:13 jetpack eliminates the need for intense parkours
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:59:34 this is not fun if you dont have jetpack
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:00:33 you cant really parkour on dense lock towers
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:01:18 you sure?
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:01:28 like, how complicated of a motorlock build?
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:02:33 how complicated is your lock tower
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:03:08 answer me
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:04:22 <@456226577798135808> show use your damn lock tower since you said you can parkour easily
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:06:19 this is fun, right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:07:53 man went silent, what a crape
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:08:15 the fuck?
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:09:57 your solution to everything complicated in motorlock tower maneuvering is just to slap ladders on top of it, while you cant provide any evidence of you doing it or having the same amount of complex parts in a lock tower
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:10:35 i suggest you to improve you ability to build, and went through pain staking, then we can talk about your ladder business
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:11:49 no shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:16:08 anyone know how to place springs so that they dont get caught up in a lock tower?

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 12:27:58 why dont US just build small boats that can easily swarm the somali pirates
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 12:29:23 darn

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 12:33:05 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 12:34:40 bombs are easier to hit, for cutter to work you must travel fast or put on blacklist, when go fast you hardly be able to aim

creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:36:29 exposed locks are hidden as best they could, the other stubs here are locked wing panels to improve pitching
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:38:54 i want to add landing gear, but since theres so much cameras for anglelocks, it sorta become a landing gear on it's own
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:48:53 added in slight geometry to the surrounding space of fake engines

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:50:57 Alright, I will try adding some red to it cuz yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:52:46 I hate building around folds on a plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:57:48 My upvote score situation has fallen into the state of “your creation bad but I’m not gonna tell you why cuz you have major skill issue”
Wowy
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:00:10 Pcc is hellhole, meanwhile boxnesx’s server is empty heaven

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:57:33 idfk
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:02:46 i dont even know anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:03:17 how do you make this kind of nose that is 2x2
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:03:27 wait, angle lock nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:03:31 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:03:34 crap
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:38:25 ive concluded that i cant figure out a way to angle lock a 2x2 nose :((
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:55:16 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:02:54 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:05:20 the size of the plane?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:06:04 i mean, it is...
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:20:42 bugs crawling on me plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:28:27 good thing i motorlock them seats into the plane <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:29:34 wemen
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:30:27 they dont understand high level of skill
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:31:16 the amount of springs this thing poob out
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:31:40 used for angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:40:03 yeah i had to reduce amount of springs me plane poobs to reduce springs being caught up inside plane
creations-chat 2021-08-06 03:41:55 anything i should change?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:42:36 :L, cant do much bout that, no spings got caught inside plane now
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:42:56 is this camera lock as people say?
creations-chat 2021-08-06 03:45:00 how do i make nose not sharp cuz its 2x2 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:45:44 i cant really camera lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:45:45 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:45:49 demise
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:46:35 no like, camera lock as in rotate the nose 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:47:22 since the nose is 2x2, theres not really any center point for me to put the motor to rotate
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:47:48 thats what i get for even width building
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:48:50 this is as small as it can get
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:51:32 :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:52:03 this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:52:25 i doubt people will make like 3 bends for that part
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:52:30 its just pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:53:45 i think it would also help with this part of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:55:46 still, its better than what im doing with the leading edge as you can see in the pic (my method is basically using cameras to block movement)
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:58:33 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:58:57 that was very old

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 13:49:42 my wifi been having skill issue since 3 hours ago and it still has it now
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 13:49:47 cant play any plane craze
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 13:49:49 sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 14:52:24 How can i know
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 14:53:31 Just kidnap shredder child and enslave them, ez time
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 14:54:11 H
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:32:59 You don’t use motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:16 How the fuck....
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:44 That’s why yo plane bad aye?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:34:30 Motorlock allows you to achieve planes that flies like ikfin
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:34:47 Be the funny drift man who terrorizes kids
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:35:56 Add gun on plane, shoot gun, estimate gun fall off, stop fire gun, fire rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:36:34 What moving part?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:38:23 There’s basically 2 major ways you pvp combat in planes, chase and intercept 

Chasing is just to get your plane as close to the enemy’s plane’s ass as close as possible, then fire rocket

Intercept is, crossing plane’s path, then fire
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:38:36 At least, that’s the way I do
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:38:39 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:40:01 Fancy aerobatics are for resetting your aim to target, resetting position, or to run away if you failed to kill plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:40:25 Well, they aren’t
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:41:42 Ask ikfin for more skill, mine is pretty basic, and relies on technological superiority and not skill, I have no skills
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:42:09 Okay whitename
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:42:52 Rocket spam and guns spread out for more hits, yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:43:09 Start using motorlock, h
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:44:38 no need to be lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:44:57 my me 262 before refit dont use motorlock, it kinda works
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:45:39 oh yeah, use vanilla control panels if you dont wanna do ddr on your keyboard
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:46:29 its just pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:48:11 if you want simplicity, gjsolo is pretty good at, simple planes for combat
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:49:31 ikfin is pretty much superior complexity
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:54:40 double rudder means less yaw
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:55:07 he gets his drift yaw from super rockets pointing sideways
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:26:21 yall guys are roughly same time right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:27:50 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:28:18 i have major skill issue dogfighting other planes in new plane cuz slippery
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:29:43 oh yeah, you know how to fix muh plane being locked in a roll or a climb?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:30:11 well no, normal seat
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:30:27 combination
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:30:37 uhm
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:31:01 wait some time
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:33:46 https://streamable.com/s30oot
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:35:24 one kinda way to fix is to move the mouse according to seat orientation, but thats a hassle, h
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:38:27 then how :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 16:39:03 the what
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 00:35:47 Don’t you think the tail is a bit too long?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 00:46:44 i have feeling wing should be bigger or sth
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 01:10:40 thats, kinda neat for a pvp plane

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:38:46 the stinky of cheese is real
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:19 i kinda think it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:49 cuz, its a tomacat, h
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:40:53 about midnight yesterday, some kid pulled out Thrizet's tomcat, and i cant chase him down, me sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:42:24 americans have the f111 that also does that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:53:36 for some reason, when joining a pvp server, it may contain up to half of the server being tuts of various kinds, and lotta dumb weapon spam on starter plane, then some turrets and battle cars
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:03:15 oooo, this bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:06:33 can kinda tell why ikfin don like AA turrets

plane-crazy 2021-08-26 12:17:36 Ah yes, finally, a carrier capable of landing my plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 12:20:23 I swear to motor god, if his land carrier is capable of internally storing my biplane
creations-chat 2021-08-26 12:21:48 It unfortunately, cannot be reduced, I would definitely add in half blocks and what not to reduce exposed locks and make airfoil shape
creations-chat 2021-08-26 12:25:14 Also, wing does fold, so there will be some compromises :L
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 12:49:55 Plane is within the tolerable zone
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 12:50:28 Oh god the intakes and exhaust tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 12:51:34 If the nose section holding the chair is 1 block thick, you can just smack yourself against the motorlocking seat and you enter it

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:00:52 clean
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:27:12 i just realised that, after finished the anglelock, i can just ditch the structure that would be use to form the needed angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:27:42 this would save lotta space and not block some other parts from functioning
general 2021-08-28 10:30:41 where default :v

creations-chat 2021-08-28 10:32:49 those would be pixel art, which wouldn't be so difficult if they know what they are doin

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:44:08 i sometimes believe im using a primitive version of anglelocks, cuz it should not be that dumb
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:46:20 so, you also use camera sticks to do anglelocks?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:47:15 so, what you use to do the angles....
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:47:34 motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 10:47:57 and, how do you set the angles for the structures....

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:17:34 disconnector for angle lock, way to go
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:18:23 not insult
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:18:56 you can see how lego turtles died
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:19:01 as well as my framerates
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:36:54 man, im just intimidated by said frames, since they all attached to the foldable part of wing, and ugly exposed locks
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:37:25 scew it, me yolo
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:37:48 alot
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:38:33 2 motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:38:42 would look unrealistic, but eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:38:55 they do
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:39:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:39:29 cant get wings to be folded at 90 degree cuz unskill
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:39:44 
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:41:43 i search inspiration and ideas from my expert aero plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:42:33 
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 07:44:36 i think i do the frames attached on lower wing to reduce complexity
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:01:57 man, this looks awful
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:03:30 the exposed locks on the wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:03:39 its too much magic
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:03:55 me like, bit bland tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:04:31 my only excuse to those exposed locks is the struts and detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:04:45 
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:06:09 uppers got wonky anglelocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:06:32 also, wings still needed to be able to do the fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:07:53 i think 2 motors for a pair of wing to reduce malfunction in case 1 part of wing got stuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:09:35 ooo, its crunchy
creations-chat 2021-08-29 08:09:54 pain for frames
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 08:10:36 stuck cuz unpro engineering ://

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:34:36 notre dame, but not in france :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:35:12 also, even with hole, plane still flies pretty stable :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:43:03 when the sr71's endurance so stronk, it deflects missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:45:33 who knows
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:50:26 i just realised the cutters i use for detail on my plane became pretty useful in pvp when nub blacklists :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:50:40 that means i can ram them
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:50:44 and they ded
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:53:21 i cant believe it, am shredr now
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:53:25 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 11:58:45 first reason is cuz he is pro in plane

speaking of plane, where your plane !!!!
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:01:26 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:01:27 i finished another one, and this time it is most pro pvp plane ive ever built
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:08:19 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:11:44 the wot?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:17:24 man, finnish engineering at it's finest
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:20:31 its a scuffed draken
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:21:25 anglelock
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:23:04 wot
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:24:28 anglelock is a teknique in which you angle a structure using locked motor, then you lock that part into main build, you can delay a lock tower from locking by using blocks that breaks weld
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:24:52 theres a tutorial for that, highly suggest you watch it
creations-chat 2021-08-31 12:27:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:33:01 when the lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:42:35 what you doin with sr :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:55:45 window kinda extends a bit further back
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:57:02 its the question of what you do with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:57:32 cuz i have absurdly high amount of hyper active keyboard control only planes that cant pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 12:58:19 man, airliner's nose are stupid hard to visualise
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:00:40 i think windows extend about another half block back would be ideal
creations-chat 2021-08-31 13:04:36 glitch control panels?

that, or the fact that your game lags, which affects physics
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:07:00 whenever i play plane craze, some of these people keep tryna fren me :v
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:07:26 pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:07:56 dunno what gold digging in this context is
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:08:53 man, i doubt they understand one bit of my creation
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:09:14 :v
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:09:16 but why
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:09:46 my late builds suffer from the cheese
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:10:27 and they aint gonna copy this
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:10:30 no way
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:11:24 man, cant join cuz unpro wifi
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:19:04 :0
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:19:34 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:20:40 i would say that skill is  capped at plane's proness, amount of rocket spam, and lag, but im not pro anyway
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:21:22 cheese allows me to save the weight, and fresh air
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:22:26 muh draken cant do fancy maneuvers, but its atleast best in balance and tracking
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:22:31 unless dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:22:35 turns like crap

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:24:26 cobra is really only useful when enemy have slow brain and cant pitch fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 13:24:34 :0

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:56:14 thats just you not being able to use other blocks as effective to avoid collision hitboxes affecting your cabin

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:58:16 use signs and other non collision blocks

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:55:29 i dont want ugly exposed locks on my small rear fin
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:56:09 so my dangerously big brain told me to motorlock 2 different parts of a moving rear fin together to get the colour scheme
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:00:04 on the other hand, this looks clean tho
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:12:41 dying cat fish, how is it

creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:17:06 you just search the plane on sketchfab and the colour scheme online

<@!414359638302130176>  wings died cuz of the way i do the tail, cockpit will be solid colour, thks

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 07:33:19 your plane from the start did make me question if you are part of pro pvp or not, nubs dont usually build like so

creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:06:36 Man, the engines, and the part that bulges out
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:07:55 Plane drifting?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:08:15 It somewhat works with a weak conv drive
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:09:37 You saw me doing some sort of a drift right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:10:02 My draken doing the cobruh?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:10:17 What if
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:10:36 Conv drive thrust vector?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:12:16 I’m thinking of slapping an external module, with shredder like motor 2 arrangement, at the end of that motor 2 placement would be the conv drive module
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:12:49 When used, it hopefully should make you move at a constant speed while you aim your plane like a sword shredder
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 09:12:56 Wait, that sounded cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:45:30 vertical booster and main part of the missile?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:46:15 so, a sub that fires a torpedo and the torp turns into a missile?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:46:49 ah
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:47:09 thought it was just missile into depth charges

general 2021-10-04 07:44:10 and the design of the props cacks the engines lul
general 2021-10-04 07:46:07 well, it was designed in the era that flying high prevents you from interception
general 2021-10-04 07:46:13 cues the U2 shoot down

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:06:59 yeah, they get spanked hard for either being too eas to kill or for using shredrs
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:13:45 just put the motor 3 on another motor to rotate it, the motor 3 would fine tune the aiming
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:14:45 thats like you say destroy the motor 2 cuz it is attached to a turret -.-

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 11:59:26 why is
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 19:36:06 ok, so i basically know how to make a sorta stable heli, minus the rotation issues created from the large rotors
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 19:39:43 question, should i fit a conv drive into my semi realistic heli <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 19:50:07 henlo ikfin
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 19:53:39 what the jar containin
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 19:57:20 are pvp helis fake planes?

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 23:22:26 the god damn A5 vigilante
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:32:08 late hello lad
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:32:33 what if aero and robo expert <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:33:49 dont you think helicopter lads should spread the know hows of making a heli more <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:34:50 like, ive only just realised how to make muh monoaxial heli stable when testing the vtol b36 concept
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:35:18 dont think i can fit that in a slightly larger than rl proportion heli :L
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:36:01 am doin the trial and error, to figure out helis basics
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:36:08 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:36:11 how tall
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:36:24 :0
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:40:24 another thing ive also realised is that you could spam control surfaces to handle the heli's movements if you cant make the rotor move so much
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:40:30 it kinda works i guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:41:38 no, am talking this style of control schemes
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:42:16 ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:43:15 wemen
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:43:37 well uh, yeah, if it is stable when hovering, why bother tilt or stuff :0
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:44:05 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:44:18 move mouse to the lower portion of screen
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:44:25 trust me, it *kinda* works
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:45:08 who cares, its plane craze
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:45:14 a
general 2021-10-10 10:48:25 post pic, an not there :L
general 2021-10-10 10:48:50 wow :0
general 2021-10-10 10:48:54 lookin kewl
general 2021-10-10 10:49:25 we don get that in busy city
general 2021-10-10 10:50:21 ye, but not in the main city cuz you study in basically nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:05:34 hmm, what needs to be change more, am having reignition of commitment to me heli

also, the prop spam you see on the sides is for roll, ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:06:09 i gave up some time ago cuz heli is very hard
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:06:21 well, mono axial heli atleast
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:56:51 cocopezae

i tryna made monoaxial heli and i think i figured out how to balance one
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:22 spank it
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:35 by any means but a shredr
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:59:46 uhm, so you know duoaxial or sth like that is 2 rotors contra-rotating like the Ka 50 right?

well i thought monoaxial is 1 rotor, sth like the huey
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:00:31 mono is particularly harder to make cuz rotor spins the heli in weird fashion
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:01:15 question is
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:01:44 how you make a heli with it's rotors actually spinning for lift, pvp capable ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:02:28 pvp helis are basically fake jets with spinning thingy, which serves little to no purpose
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:04:37 eh, cuz i cant fit a swashy boi, this will do i guess :L
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:12:15 when did you, fail to compete with Gamma's plane size
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:13:29 i know its pain, kinda like buildin botes lul

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:50:19 eh, i guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 18:38:52 any ideas on making the rotor look better?
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 18:40:04 and thats why it don hover
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 18:42:14 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:11:57 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:31:09 uhm, reduce weight i guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:31:18 its the problem with traction i think
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:42:44 this piece of technology dazzles most of pcc randoms

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:59:04 the kind of copier that i kinda respect is the ones that can copy a fairly sizeable motrlock build, spawned
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:59:16 it does took scary skills for that
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:59:21 or hecks :L

the-dump 2021-10-31 23:47:24 thought you would be more experienced with server etiquettes considering you got expert
creations-chat 2021-10-31 23:48:38 <@456226577798135808> your f14's nose dont look so good with that black panel sticking out for different colour

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:03:56 <@!619312093962829849> good dogfight lol, although you should train your aim more
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:04:11 me neither
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:06:27 they suck

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:25:30 hes gone
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:26:31 thats the conv drive dying to the complex evasive maneuvers this thing can pull off
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:27:51 i manage to fit 3 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:28:33 again, its a half pvp, half good looking build, which means its shitty at both
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:29:29 kinda hard if you want good details on a plane that flies well
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:30:08 not expose locks, the added weight to the details just cucks the plane's agility
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:36:08 well, yes

also, hi
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:37:30 man, what
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:38:57 the conv that was placed so was an attempt to make the plane do the cobruh that other's drakens can do

but it can makes the plane move in funny way, you can watch this i guess

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:23:18 Should I use text half locked onto the rudder for decals and such, or should I use signs 

My experience with decals don’t go great becuz at certain angles, they disappear
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:25:11 I think imma build the F104, I like the plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:34:49 <@!294980570885390346> should i, should i go for a 70% anglelock fuselage for the sake of looks?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:37:01 ye, now i activate muh builder tryhard mode, which is pain
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:42:25 e

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:46:56 is this the right config for using tnt in anglelock?

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:00:09 oh you prick
creations-chat 2021-11-01 20:11:03 is this good start for the f104's nose, and what could be done to make it accurate?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:23:10 F104 nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:23:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:23:45 make it epic
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:27:52 fun fact: due to the 104's T tail design, it could drop bombs at supersonic speed while not having to worry the bomb colliding with the rear elevator, but we all know what a ground attack f 104 turns out to be
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:30:38 hello yousuf
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:33:46 if so, the dual variable geometry wing would allow the wing to essenstially tuck in itself like a chicken
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:36:03 wow, that looks like crap, like, wow
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:36:48 am surprised by how bad it is lul
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:42:47 no like, it doesn't matter the combination really, the nose could be improved upon also

plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:36:48 camera lock is both a blessing and a curse
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:37:56 well, you can, but exposed locks
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:39:46 my star figher is an example of that, as there is only a 1.5 block allowance to hid motors and pistons
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:41:50 its gonna add an additional 10 blocks or sth to half lock the exposed motors into the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:42:01 ah yes, using motorlock to hide exposed locks
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:42:14 i can send it here lul

plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:44:27 just, think of them like normal blocks, and lock together like so
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:44:34 its kinda straight forward
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:45:26 just, motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:45:28 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:16:32 the super rockets engines exist just to compliment the plane's speed when needing to evade, other than that, it moves fast and weaves hard
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:17:35 its for torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:17:52 cuz
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:18:12 my heli dont even need them, the super rockets exist is to give variable lift output
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:19:28 bro, you just need motors and angled wing panels, that isnt hard at all

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 17:05:19 making sth big that needs folding would make it hard to keep it's proportions consistent

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 18:44:04 the b47 came out 3 years after the b29, crazy

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:07:49 :0
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:11:04 camo is not too good, superstructure is weird, bridge needs rework, and turret needs more work
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:12:01 and also the cone hat thing, but am not gonna say anything bout it cuz thats just pain
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:12:57 also, yeah, the bow is angled downwards, keep that in mind
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:17:20 well, i dont really care about the interior so, e

creations-chat 2022-01-11 19:41:25 supposedly the neu balgray
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:41:29 nose heavy
holes between the control surfaces and the plane
intakes narrows down to exhaust
and many other issues that cant be described by word cuz of the sheer amount of inaccuracies on the plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:42:22 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:43:23 i almost want to just say **no**

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:25:03 the
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:28:18 again, i dont really care about interior unless the build is centered around it
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:30:18 cuz, its hard to have good interior when your anglelock addiction just occupies that space
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:46:09 woah
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:18:12 That carrier is way too long and the tower needs to be larger or sth
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:21:08 Better throughput I suppose
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 21:46:50 You fold plates
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 21:46:55 Yeah
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:49:37 Put the half lock motor inside the plane, then extend that out with cameras or texts onto the folding motor
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:57:00 Cuz this place turns into an argument channel when an unde gets criticized

plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:53:14 its fine time you learn camlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:53:29 camlock is pretty easy
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:55:52 camera welds to main chair when you make it look at sth

it rotates the structure around it based on the amount of angles it rotated from original position

dont make the structure or the camera touch anything including main chair

camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:56:53 like, its even easier than traditional anglelocking

plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:13:19 i have an ide
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:13:20 idea
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:13:48 what if when you press a button, your motorlocked bomb expand to cover a wide area instead of spitting out all the bombs
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:23 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:30 instead they dont scatter
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:35 it forms a solid net
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:42 and covers wide area
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:51 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:14:57 idea
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:15:40 cuz this is just dumb https://streamable.com/jtpvsu
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:18:23 no like
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:18:30 you know those motorlock bombs?
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:18:58 instead of putting disconnectors on the tower, when you press the release button it would unlock the tower
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:20:13 ropes would have problem with that since you sorta have to figure out a way to expand that rope out
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:20:23 but yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:21:46 stucks to plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:23:10 why dont you just stuck the bombs into the motorlock tower and not worry about the rope :0
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:23:23 no disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:24:02 which is why it requires the skill to build a bomb with atleast 2 plot wide explosion radius
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:25:08 what if when the tower expand, it smacks the enemy and they got fling <:Thonk:509498568982134816> 

wait, cutters attached to it so that it would slice shit when it expand <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:25:57 you wont be expanding the tower when it is falling right?

only when it is close to the ground or enemy
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:26:10 it would kinda make a good anti air bomb at that
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:41:43 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:43:37 attach to wing to increase volume and flexibility, at the cost of roll rate https://streamable.com/cmidhf
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:44:22 the stratojet and the thunderchief

plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:54:47 <@!447221768520859659> hmmm, lookin at this makes me wanna do a super etendard firing an exocet <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:56:11 should i improve heli with the thing <:Thonk:509498568982134816> https://streamable.com/7ijpqq
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:56:50 cuz funny
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:57:44 how do i make heli faster tho, i know theres a lad here who hab a pvp heli, hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:57:54 its more realistic too lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:58:14 fake heli smh
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:58:52 blade tilting
the fake helis am talking about are ones that fly like a plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 02:59:21 make the mushroom more round
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:00:43 very little cuz essentially the jet engine inside the heli serves as a modified turbo prop
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:01:40 even if am going 200 and under aa exposure, i still wreak AA lol <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:01:54 the skill issue in them is real
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:03:33 theres gotta be a way i can remove wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:03:34 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:08:17 wing panels provide stability to heli, but it also limit speed
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:11:57 theres a reason why i kinda do that, cuz helicopter can remain in firing position (aiming down at the ground) meanwhile not hitting it, which means sustain fire
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:12:35 mmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:12:37 complicated
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:13:14 besides my vrigpen kinda fulfills the boom and zoom tactics
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 03:30:44 that took you long enough

plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:55:11 Although
How small do you want the bomber to be
Use size reference
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:57:14 That’s a fucking attacker
Not a medium or light bomber
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:57:22 Like, ground attack
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:57:25 Should have said so
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:58:30 The A10 by that standard would be a light bomber
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:59:29 Penetration bomber
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 13:59:54 Yeah but he brings out an attacker plane for reference of a light bomber

plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:01:34 Nah it can reach supersonic low to the ground
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:02:15 Yes
That’s why planes getting slower

plane-crazy 2022-05-18 14:03:02 Range would be poo water so it can only serve in a very limited role

creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:56:12 Hide pistons in the body and use texts to connect the parts ig
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:59:40 But the pistons can push less than half a block tho
creations-chat 2022-07-26 21:02:29 I still don’t see a problem how you can’t just put the piston in the bottom which negates the exposed piston heads tho
creations-chat 2022-07-26 21:05:08 Your right lmao I haven’t played plane craze that seriously since
Idk last year or sth lol

plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:56:42 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 16:56:49 It can still look good lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 17:01:07 Should I make the camo not too good
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 17:03:33 So you see how the camo is working to conceal the ship
Would it look better if I make a camo that’s like razzle dazzle or sth
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 17:04:11 I touched grass too long that I can’t make shots look good anymore

plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:11:04 photography lore
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:11:59 i dont really wanna mess with the settings much cuz dad already freaked out at me for using manual focus (he uses automatic)
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:12:21 so editing the pics?
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:12:50 sorry but i dont know or think i even have the tools for that
hows the propotions and focus tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:13:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:13:58 slapped memory card straight into the laptop and got it directly from it

plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:16:37 i had to change it before gave it back to dad
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:17:38 main reason is i wanna improve my skills and thinking that manual better
bulshit one is cuz environment messy and may affect the focus
idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:18:47 i would say this is a weird one cuz i focused it to the middle of those knob adjuster
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 00:20:20 hmm

general 2022-10-30 02:44:33 F105 but different
general 2022-10-30 02:45:30 Radar jamming still means you can track down the jamming tho right
general 2022-10-30 02:46:16 Your average ww2 AA don’t need that
Ye olden days
general 2022-10-30 02:46:53 What is the concept of stealth even
general 2022-10-30 02:46:59 Not appear on radar?
general 2022-10-30 02:47:08 So strike out of radar range
general 2022-10-30 02:47:32 A B52 carrying cruise missiles could be considered stealthy then
Cuz it uses stand-off weapons
general 2022-10-30 02:48:00 Yeah but you ain’t got radar on it
general 2022-10-30 02:48:05 Cuz cruise missiles moment
general 2022-10-30 02:49:14 I mean if you were to stay at the other end of the earth’s curvature firing cruise missiles then you won’t appear on radar right
general 2022-10-30 02:49:53 Cuz desert storm moment
general 2022-10-30 02:50:49 You gotta notice the role of strategic bombers are more of a power projection thing tho
So yes cruise missiles on B52 cuz large and it can
general 2022-10-30 02:52:25 Those are ICBMs
Which has virtually unlimited range
Cruise missiles do not
general 2022-10-30 02:52:52 Slow af
general 2022-10-30 02:53:35 Huh
general 2022-10-30 02:53:42 Must have got the wrong thing
general 2022-10-30 02:53:52 Cuz there was a transport plane carrying a icbm
general 2022-10-30 02:53:55 Cuz America
general 2022-10-30 02:54:35 In a sense the F104 is a cruise missile
Manned missile
Can carry nuclear payload
And can be launched from zero length launch pad
general 2022-10-30 02:55:06 Yeah cruising at you

plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:29:52 Low super structure
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:31:26 Actually motorlock wise it’s pretty simple
I don’t so so much complex motorlock needed to achieve that level of detail
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:33:59 You only need motorlock if your build small and you want small details
For that tho, no
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:36:08 Am talking ship wise

Your prob alone in this
Unless you want help with dumbing down of expectations cuz really tho, getting into a mindset of not making shit builds instead of making pro builds is better for your mental health

You could ask me for hull designs, dunno bout turrets tho, atlantas are small and for accurate scale you would be using my secondaries
general 2022-11-17 04:03:09 Doing online is surprisingly easy taken for granted the kind of people your with so
general 2022-11-17 04:03:10 Idk

creations-chat 2022-11-17 04:04:49 You scale the ship to the turrets

plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:50:41 although her problem is that she gets stripped of weapons way too quickly
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:51:29 ea
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:52:11 6 guns, 4 rockets and 2 fireworks is not enough of a reason

creations-chat 2023-04-27 12:18:17 Hof is kinda impossible to get since there are better builds that don’t get accepted into HOF

Am talking 400+ upvote builds that isn’t a block or a joke build
general 2023-04-27 14:48:22 Well my boat is pretty small so
general 2023-04-27 15:22:18 The average weapons are faster than shredders
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:06:52 Oh wow the gun did sth
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:11:15 I need to retire my plane omg
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:11:22 I never made anything better than that gripen
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:11:31 And that thing is starting to show its age
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:11:47 I can’t
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:11:51 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:12:04 I want to make 5th gen plane since they have more internal space
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:12:09 I want fit thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:12:35 But you don’t use Ikfin method of fighting tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:12:56 Am gone make the J20
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:12:59 Cuz funny
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:13:09 Or sth else
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:13:21 Did you?
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:14:00 So it’s not really Ikfin method
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:14:47 You claim him your teacher even though only thing you learned from him is basically inspiration and not from his own method
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:15:49 Hmm
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:16:02 I still retain much of Ikfin’s method
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:16:16 I still use his dogfighting method
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:16:24 Although my yaw is a lot stronger than his
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:16:32 Becuz flashy sky dancing
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:16:43 I use more lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:17:11 When I reused ikfin’s given plane, it felt a lot more sluggish than my gripen
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:18:30 Yeah you have less static mobility than mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:18:43 But my plane is best used at 600sps so
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:18:44 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:20:14 My plane too light that when I sharply turn with mouse only, it loses like 400 sps
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:20:17 When I use keyboard
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:20:22 Instant slow
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:20:59 But hey it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:22:03 
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:22:09 That’s not entirely useful
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:22:11 But aight
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 18:23:16 I basically just fly sideways against an approaching plane becuz I can dodge easily with that insane low speed maneuverability

creations-chat 2023-05-03 01:47:58 tbh tho, i dont think theres gonna be a truly better Tomcat in PCC

lotta higher qualities looks good yes, but comparing them is hard, they are just kinda like different flavors of the same thing, nothing is really outstanding
creations-chat 2023-05-03 01:55:28 no, i think its just another F14 cuz there really isnt a better Tomcat, for example Animated.P's or SR's or who else i cant rember cuz theres so much

they kinda saturated the standards of "good" for a tomcat

creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:18:38 You technically could make any build be PvP capable and be decent looking compared to pre-shit pcc standards if you have a strong enough set up that allows you to not be physics lagged

Camlock is short for camera lock, in which you use the camera to angle parts
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 19:13:38 my ship was entirely made from camlock since it was pvp

plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:11:24 OW2 is, ehh
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:11:48 for what PC2 would offer, its not even close
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:11:56 in terms of improvement
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:13:14 do you have the slightest idea how much of modern pc1 techniques derived from glitches?
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:13:37 most important would be water physics
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:13:42 or improvement to the game engine
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:13:47 that would be godly
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:14:19 dudeeee i had this 4k bote that i cant even spawn anymore so i deleted it
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:15:30 in pc2 camera lock would actually be more promoted
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:15:39 since the camera would keep the orientation
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:15:41 so thats good
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:16:08 plain pain
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:16:20 improvements to stability
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 17:19:08 your fake!
