help 2020-09-14 16:56:05 Does anyone got an idea of how to make an eccentric/cam?
help 2020-09-14 16:58:43 Also you can just use an anchored block to keep the pad on the ground.
help 2020-09-14 16:58:56 Or ballast.
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 21:52:18 
help 2020-09-15 00:56:48 Why can't I make a working v engine block?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 01:06:06 Now paint the motors
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:57 
help 2020-09-15 18:15:48 Look up motor lock gun
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:24:36 i think i might use that torpedo design but convert it to a drop bomb
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:24:46 anyone got a good bomb tail design?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:18 pistons
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:23 steam pistons
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:41 make an exposed steam engine
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:27:16 you could incorporate the steam locomotive piston design and make a vertical version for the steampunk machine
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:28:03 and then hide the suspension block
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:49:49 <@!319998854982270977> Here are 2 steam engine designs, one vertical and one horizontal. Red = Anchored Block. Dark Gray = Fixed Component. Light Gray = Moving Component.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:50:46 https://gyazo.com/49fb2dba87d4056714e8c42853ffd9b7
Here's a gif of the engines functioning.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:52:21 You can remove one of the pistons and the flywheel and just have a single cylinder engine.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:53:30 The engines I designed are meant so that the suspension blocks are able to be concealed so you don't see the blue springs.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:53:53 You could probably use motor lock if you know how to do it right.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:54:51 Also I just noticed that I forgot to complete the counterweights on the horizontal engine.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:55:32 The engines I designed are meant more to be for show, as you can see by the flywheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:13 You mean 0.2RPM
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:26 Wait oh
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:29 I'm dumber
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:40 I meant 0.2RPS
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:57:55 My steam engines run at about 96 RPM
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:58:48 Has anyone figured out how fast 1 speed is?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:59:07 No velocity of 1
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:02:00 Apparently a stud is 5cm.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:02:37 So the player travels at 4mph while running.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:03:07 And the default plane flies at something like 20mph
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:04:44 Well at that speed my Gotha Bomber travels at about 80mph.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:06:15 So basically one stud per second is equivalent to about 1 kilometer per hour.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:07:40 Subsonic planes.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:08:59 Damn the irl kamikaze plane is twice as fast as the ingame planes people make tutorials of.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:09:36 And wow my triplane is slow as hell.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:10:47 The triplane I made to scale travels at like half the speed of the actual Fokker Triplane.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:59 bruh all planes in the game made to scale travel half as fast as the real ones
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:16:30 The tutorial b-17 travels at like 120 mph while the real thing travels at nearly 300 mph.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:12 But studs are like feet
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:21 1 sps is like 1 kph
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:13 if a stud was a 20th of a meter then everything travels super slow
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:08 wait
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:18 little people
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:33 ah a model plane would be slow
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:08 20 mph for a plane the size of a model plane probably makes sense
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:19 for like some of the faster planes
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:47 Roblox is slow and small.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:21:29 Just average stud to average human height of 5 ft
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:21:37 then everything makes sense
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:22:14 lets not measure in beeg legos
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:23:06 i don't like using 5cm legos to base my speeds and sizes it just confuses me
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:24:07 Isn't a conveyer belt just a long wheel?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:25:08 A tired wheel is a wheel or wheels covered by a tire.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:25:30 You could have a car wheel where the metal wheel was actually smaller wheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:26:58 Modern fighter planes can't fly without their computers.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:02:42 By the way what do flaps do again?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:08:05 wait are we allowed to post gyazo links in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:10:33 it auto delets it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:10:50 But here is the link
https://gyazo.com/79c0a752f8d4ca79a8afa6032ad9fb32
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:12:48 Its cool when you turn of automatic controls because then you can do flips and rolls without the need of a propeller or thruster to do so.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:24:49 <@!516385356006817792> I took your torpedo design and converted it into a simple drop bomb.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:49:07 Anyone invent eccentrics yet?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:50:21 bruh inventor lel
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:10:44 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/750437062993379401
This is useful
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:13:52 Now how do I make the linkage
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:12 Steam train linkage
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:18 This
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:58 Its what Antelope made a while ago
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:19:06 the channel link
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:20:06 I think the screenshot I took is how the thing was assembled.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:23:11 need to make the wings thicker
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:28:20 I am using half blocks and motor lock
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:36:00 Powah
help 2020-09-16 20:08:31 how do i connect the motor to the wheel here?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 20:49:08 https://gyazo.com/a31925ab0115ef8ed9c68949838577e4
I did it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 20:50:02 So ladders act as connectors that phase through blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:22:02 https://gyazo.com/f15cb684b58c5e39bbda2050c207cbd1
I'm working on something.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:29:41 Mmm yes...collision.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:22:23 https://gyazo.com/6c39346d62ecba1f6cda8ab688ef5aaf
I added the cylinder.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:23:13 If you can figure out how to recreate the eccentric rods, sure.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:23 Now I need to make more cylinders and valve rods yay.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:40 Valve rods are complicated
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:47 They need eccentric rods
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:54 But we don't have eccentrics
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:27:19 So you need to do some weird physics breaking phasing through blocks stuff to create eccentric rods in the game.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:28:55 https://gyazo.com/23d1eb2ef1a475290ee1afc1a1352a89
creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:29:22 https://gyazo.com/900b649d269322e41c4edcb8f3a49cdb
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:33:41 The test that most trains fail in this game is the incline test.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:35:32 going up the hill track
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:35:51 you know that track leading up to the bridge
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:38:53 this seems to be difficult for trains to do
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:40:56 My 2-8-2 Mikado chassis can travel all segments of the rail.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:41:20 Even the sharp turns and high grade segments.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:22:59 It's not easy to fly a twin mustang when you only have one pilot.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:23:28 Its not easy to fly a twin plane in general when there's only one pilot.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:25:58 According to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, my F-82 Twin Mustang needs 21 more rockets than I have armed on it right now.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:26:34 25 missiles on a single small plane.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:27:08 Sometimes the engines sound like dogs.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:28:38 Freezing and noclipping while parachuting as only a head and torso is a totally intended feature.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:29:14 And ladders phasing through blocks is also a totally intended feature.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:29:35 No like on your own build.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:30:10 That phasing thing is actually useful for certain things like realistic train wheels and engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:30:55 You can attach a ladder to a motor and while the motor spins the ladder can go through blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:31:26 Ladders can go through ladders as well.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:32:09 no like you see here?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:32:34 where the cranks attach to the wheel
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:33:22 The ladders don't have collision like motor bases.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:33:51 Ladders don't have block collision*
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:35:38 https://gyazo.com/3d41dca6e8335d9ee34e652206799849
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:35:48 See?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:01 The ladders don't collide with each other all the time.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:24 I use that to make steam engines lol.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:37 I've rejoined and it still doesn't collide.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:44 I made that engine a few days ago.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:37:03 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:38:50 
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:39:06 The only error message I see
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:39:47 
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:40:37 It doesn't experience any errors so it's probably something else that has to do with how ladders work in the game.
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:16:18 Wings? Who needs wings?
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:17:33 Say that to War Thunder players
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:19:49 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSntnv9psXY
Say that to this player.
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:20:24 Both halves of his main wing were cut off
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:20:58 Well it's one big wing.
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:21:11 Those aren't wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:21:14 Those are stubs
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 22:16:52 This is fine.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:52:46 I think you do it on phone.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:15:42 Is that a rotary or radial engine?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:16:41 Both look very similar, but the difference is that one spins and the other does not.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:16:53 Rotary engines spin, radial engines don't spin.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:18:22 Wait what the hell is that engine it doesn't have propellers.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:18:36 Is it a jet engine on the front of a plane?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:01:24 Because the plane is too big
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:01:55 Because I don't have space
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:02:11 I don't have space
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:03:31 Ok I'll make the wings shorter
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:03:36 How much shorter though?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:04:05 k I'll make them 75% the size
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:07:03 If 50% wing size too small?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:13:00 you happy now?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:16:46 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:17:24 ok now i paint it and finish the interior
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:17:43 Rn the paint is 100,100,100
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:18:01 should i make the paint 150 or 125?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:18:33 ight shiny b-17 time
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:20:10 ima also tweak the interior
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:49:15 okay is it good now?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:50:38 I can't make the fuselage any longer without doing complicated stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:52:47 Bruh my vertical controls on my b-17 are reversed, so I gotta move my mouse down to pitch up.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:06 I use both manual and automatic controls.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:17 I have motor flaps and control surfaces.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:52 But because of where the control surfaces are, my mouse acts more like a yoke than the plane following where the mouse is.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:55:34 If I move the mouse down, the plane goes up, and if I move the mouse up, the plane goes down.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:56:22 No for like the control surfaces, not the motor flaps.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:56:31 The motor flaps are keyboard controlled.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:59:37 Well I mean it doesn't really bother me much, it just means my mouse cursor behave more like a mouse yoke than as the mouse as a target.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:09:25 How do I name the controls?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:09:42 Ah
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:23:25 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:27:14 Engine 1 stall
Engine 2 Stall
Engine 4 Stall
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:28:15 Make the bullet a magnet drive.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:29:24 No like use 2 magnets pulling each other.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:29:57 A magnet drive is 3 blocks long.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:04 How long is the bullet.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:31 Wait the bullet is 2 blocks long.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:46 Nevermind just use a single bullet.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:31:51 Ah yes, cramped spaces.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:37:24 If that's an AK, that magazine is way too fucked up.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:37:54 Unless it's supposed to be a 2-dimensional drum.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:38:44 AK-47 but it's very pro-government.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:39:44 At lest have a curved magazine.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:40:40 Even 16*16 pixel art of an AK has a curved magazine.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:27 See even this has a curved mag.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:50 Yes that's a minecraft texture of an ak
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:57 and even it has the curved mag
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:42:18 Oh god it's even worse.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:43:20 <@!710208141144489995> Please at least fix the mag first it hurts to see a straight mag on an AK
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:27:50 you use a computer to control planes like those
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:27:59 not manual controls
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:28:26 no not manual nor cursor control
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:28:36 onboard computer controls
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:29:13 has someone made an automated plane in this game?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:24:50 Yo how do I make a pumpjack?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:26:05 Those things they use to get oil.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:26:41 Kind of like an oil rig but on land.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:11 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:16 This thing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:47 Those things you find all over Arabia
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:30 hmm i think ill make a paddle boat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:56:52 how's this for a paddle wheel?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:15 Because it's a paddleboat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:45 It's like asking why the bottoms of ships were red
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:30 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:44 That paddlewheel looks pretty red to me.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:14 Paddleboat typically refers to riverboats.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:36 Paddle steamer typically refers to marine ships with paddlewheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:06:49 I'm making a stern-mounted paddle boat.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:06:56 Not a side wheel one
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:11:57 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:12:54 what im using as primary inspiration for the design
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:13:14 my steamboat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:13:19 and yes it is that game
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:48:08 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:51:36 *Hissing noises.*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:53:57 Now to make the boilers
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:54:14 Top speed of 20
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:54:26 I bet it's gonna get slower
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:05 I added boilers and now it moves fast forward but slow backwards
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:21 Which in a way is kinda realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:41 Steam vehicles typically had a higher top speed moving forwards than they did moving backwards.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:49 Both trains and ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:17:36 The advantage of steam over sail is that they don't have to make a full 180 degree turn to go the other direction.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:17:45 Also that they don't rely on wind.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:18:01 ikr
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:18:43 As long as you have fuel and water you can basically travel whever you wnat.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:19:13 Meanwhile Normans waiting for 6 months for the wind to change direction to invade England.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:19:47 The most dangerous things about steam are heat and pressure.

creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:02:25 What's the best material for a paddlewheel?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:05:11 What's the best material for a water propeller?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:16:30 
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:37:43 Damn my steamboat takes forever to turn
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:35:00 ok it back to actually moving
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:50:34 So apparently paddlewheels are made of steel.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:50:41 So that's why they're painted red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:18 No like the paddlewheels of steamboats.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:39 Like the riverboats and marine ships before the screw propeller.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:59 The same reason why the bottom of a ship's hull is red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:52:21 Because water likely.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:52:30 You paint metal so it doesn't rust.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:56:52 The red paint they use on ships is designed to slow the speed the steel rusts because the water speeds up the rusting process.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:57:49 When ships used to have copper hulls instead of steel.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:24 So they just painted the steel red because they were familiar with the red bottoms of copper ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:34 Before they used steel hulls though.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:38 It was copper.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:58 Wait no they painted the copper red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:59:34 Before they made the hulls of ships of steel they were made of copper and they painted the copper red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:00:15 To prevent a patina forming and barnacles they used the red paint.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:00:37 And when they transitioned to steel they continued to use the red paint to prevent rust and barnacles.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:01:34 But either way the reason a ship's hull is red and paddle wheels are red is because they are made of metal.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 18:48:35 You need more of it.

The bigger engine I made is able to actually work.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:37:40 I know.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:38:18 Spinning an engine is purely decorational.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:38:57 The things that go up and down less than the pistons?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:39:18 Those are the valves.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:39:50 They are what allow the steam to drive the pistons.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:41:28 Well the valves allow the pistons to continuously turn.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:42:06 The first steam engine was an atmospheric engine, which was really slow and inefficient because it relied on the air to push the piston back down.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:42:23 It was also very heavy, which made it basically impossible to use on ships.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:43:55 The valve gear allows the valve to automatically reset the piston.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:48:05 One of the main problems I have is finding a ship to incorporate the engine into, as practically all marine vessels from 1914 and on used steam turbines instead of reciprocating steam engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:48:38 And around some time after that those were mostly replaced by diesel engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:50:38 The most notable ships I am aware of that used reciprocating engines still in the 1910s and on were the Olympic Class Ocean Liners, but they had 2 sets of 4 cylinder engines for the side propellers and used a steam turbine to drive the main propeller.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:51:33 Parsons turbine literally replacing everything steamship.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 15:38:00 I now made it a "triple expansion" engine.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 15:40:50 What I mean by "triple expansion" is that it isn't actually a triple expansion engine, because all the pistons move at the same time.

plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:50:50 It's because me P-51 is painted in RAF Scheme.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:51:57 Maybe I should've painted mine with a Flying Tigers paint scheme.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:56:04 Or maybe like the third paint scheme.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:57:38 Red Tail paint scheme seems too mainstream.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:58:19 The YouTube tutorial for the P-51 uses that paint scheme.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:00:10 Yo what if someone made a P-51 but it was actually to scale but it also still retained a lot of detail?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:02:40 Oh my god the M O T O R L O C K that would need.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:03:21 But also what if it actually had the flying capabilities of an actual P-51 as well?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:03:40 Like actually be able to do stunt tricks like all the fighter planes of WW2?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:10:56 The P-51 I have is *cough cough* somewhat able to do barrel rolls, but no way in hell can it do an aileron roll.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:12:48 The main problem with an aileron roll is the plane typically noses straight down if you try to do it properly.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:13:10 Meanwhile irl planes can typically do a few rolls before having to nose up.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:15:01 Planes I make don't like to do aileron rolls, they like to crash into the ground if I try.
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 04:17:54 What kind of plane would do aileron rolls better, one with straight wings or one with angled/inverted gull wings?

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 04:31:32 And both serve the same purpose; reducing friction.
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 04:34:32 Also the paddlewheels come in contact with each other while spinning, but that doesn't really hurt the performance of either engine.

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 06:36:38 Yeah I died before I could even fucking lock the motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 06:37:23 There needs to be either longer spawn immunity or shredder bugs need to be purged of useability.
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 06:37:55 A 5 second spawn immunity.
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 06:38:23 But after that you have shit protection from shredder bugs and missiles.

creations-chat 2020-11-15 06:12:05 Whichever you chose is the one you count for scoring, usually and preferably the one with the most votes is the one you should go with.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:31:21 The center connecting rod snapped on this an Boom, sent flying into the air.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:33:17 While on the rails it works fine but win trying to operate in place it has a tendency to suffer damage.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:35:17 It's kind of like how dry firing a bow is dangerous.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:39:30 Because the bowstring isn't exerting force on any physical object like an arrow when the string is released.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:40:52 The energy doesn't go into an arrow because there is none, so instead it goes into the bow itself and the user holding it through damage.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:43:02 Also in many cases high speed can cause craft to lose most of their stability.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:43:16 Especially when attempting turning.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:44:09 That makes sense I guess
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:45:15 Lots of things make sense, like how text blocks have no collision whatsoever, and how with enough weird messing around with stuff, you get get blocks like ladders and even half blocks to phase through each other sometimes.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:46:26 Also I have noticed that blocks with smaller hitboxes tend to be more likely to pass through other blocks than those with larger hitboxes.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:07 Try making them fly slower.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:13 That usually works.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:49:41 If you make any hard maneuver on any high speed craft it tends to not handle well.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:50:41 Although sometimes you can stabilize an unstable craft that lost stability due to roll or yaw by making a hard pitch maneuver.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:51:20 Motorlock.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:33 Sometimes doing an unstable maneuver can stabilize an unstable craft.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:53:14 Is your rocket plane violently shaking because you tried to make a right turn while going at 1200 studs per second? Pull up.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:53:44 If pulling up doesn't work, throttle down.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:54:55 The two best ways to stabilize an over speeding aircraft are to throttle down and pitch up, in other words slow down the aircraft.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:31 Missiles still follow the same principle of high speed plane stability.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:58:56 Slow down missile
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:14:55 I made a better version of it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:16:31 No my design isn't mainly about size, it's about weight

bug-reports 2020-11-17 14:14:26 So it turns out with a high enough torque and speed in general you can use motors to force blocks to clip through other blocks in strange ways, be it partially or fully clipping through the block. Depending on factors, the clipping may result in the thing just passing through but slowing down, or the thing may do what I like to call a snap clipping where the thing just instantaneously clips through a wall of blocks usually due to jamming on something.

creations-chat 2020-12-05 05:22:25 It's not really that complex, and this will probably make it more understandable.
creations-chat 2020-12-05 06:09:42 It uses a single eccentric held in place usually by a single bearing around the crankshaft. Each bucket is attached to the crankshaft by pivots, rather than being held rigidly in place like with a standard paddlewheel. Attached to each bucket is a rotating arm connected to the eccentric. The motion of the crankshaft causes the eccentric to move and hold the buckets in the position they are currently in, which is vertical, so they remain vertical while in motion.

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:18:31 Now all I got to do is make the port side engine.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:18:56 And add a whole bunch of detail.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:20:05 Actually, it's roughly 1.5:1 scale if the player is the size of the average human, or similar in scale to the reciprocating engines in the James Cameron movie.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:20:37 1997 movie scale, looks bigger than it actually would've in real life.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:21:51 Making things 1:1 scale turns out to be extremely difficult, without the assistance of an agonizing amount of repetitive, overcomplicated motorlock.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:22:25 And there's only so much detail you can cram into something on 1:1 scale.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:46:57 Well, motorlock is intended to do what it says, which is lock motors in their position, but there's a bug that causes the motor to move halfway inside of the base when in fly mode. Roblox patched this bug, but Rickje brought it back into the game because it broke everyone's builds that took advantage of the clip spawning.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:48:30 On powered locked motors, you can fix the clipping issue by using the motor, which will revert the the half block clipping and the locked motor will function as intended.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:49:31 However, on unpowered motors, since there is no way to use them as the input command is disabled, they ont revert back to the correct state, which is what many of us take advantage of.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:51:02 Basically, <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:52:47 If you place 2 unpowered locked motors with the bases facing each other and the motors facing outward (in an I shape, big flat ends opposite each other), when in fly mode the 2 block tower will contract into a 1 block space.
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 05:54:19 You can use this to your advantage by linking them up in this arrangement of a sort of step-like manner to make a 30-block tower of unpowered locked motors contract into a 1 block space, and force blocks to bypass their hitboxes.

bug-reports 2020-12-20 21:42:04 The power of the jetpack is directly proportional to your framerate. Higher frames = more propulsion upward. Lower frames = less propulsion upward. If you have very low frames the jetpack may not even be able to propel you upwards at all no matter what.

plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:38:33 The bombs are so heavy they can't be moved at all by the player, even at half default gravity, and actually cause the bomber to require constant adjustment pointing upwards because the weight is so extreme.
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:39:45 If I'm not constantly tapping the up button, even with the auto control surfaces, the bomber will nose down when the bombs are loaded.
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:44:23 One main problem I have with Vulpen's bombers is that instead of arranging the bombs in the traditional, horizontal manner, he arranges them vertically.
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:44:52 I mean, yeah, you can pack a lot more bombs when placing them vertically, but motor lock exists too, you know.

creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:23:29 Well, the downward angle probably follows the principle of gull wings, minus the hard bend gull part of course. If you look at say, a WW2 monoplane fighter with the wings attached toward the bottom of the fuselage, you'll notice that the wings are angled slightly upwards, so the location of the wing relative to the fuselage probably affects it's angle.

plane-crazy 2021-02-02 15:50:26 Can I use this to make a steering gear for a rudder?
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 15:55:53 Is there a better design for a gear like that?

plane-crazy 2021-02-02 22:30:15 I don't know what to call this thing, I tore the wings off in a high speed dive.

creations-chat 2021-02-04 05:58:33 Well, I just started making it. Of course I'm gonna add more detail like windshield frames, and also plan to add the cockpit doors and such and such.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 06:00:48 Well, that's what I'm doing. I'm using motorlock to make it detailed. But until it's complete, I'm just going to use a simplistic paint scheme until the detail is added.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:13:20 How does the cockpit look so far?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:15:28 I need to add the pilot's door and then the cockpit is more or less complete. Well, also need to add frames but that can happen later.
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 17:45:53 I wanna make something like this but I want the rack to be a gear.

creations-chat 2021-02-05 02:59:59 Mmm should I make of variation of the He-111 with the Fritz X on it?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:02:20 It's kind of difficult to hide the motorlock on the wings, because otherwise they wouldn't be bent upwards.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:04:55 It's going to very quickly overcomplicate my build if I try and hide the lock in the middle, because of position of stuff blah blah blah, and the hole in the roof near the tail is where the bulk of the motorlock is concealed.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:21:21 so i started uhhh...
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 04:35:18 memory overload
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 00:21:16 so uhhh....
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:51:20 Apparently, this is a tank to some people.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:53:51 The back wheels are supposed to be on a track but that would make it not move well.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:54:18 Conveyer screw up steering.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:54:50 Because I the it together in 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:55:33 Besides there are people that make tanks without the treads.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:56:32 It's sole purpose is basically a mobile flak gun it just needs to shot down planes.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:57:04 It's supposed to resemble a half track somewhat but I'm not making treads.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:57:49 You know what would be a cool addition?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:57:55 Half block fuel tanks.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:58:41 So you can cram fuel inside the wing of your plane if the wing is thicker than 0.1 of a block.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:59:08 Realism
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:59:32 The majority of a plane's fuel is stored inside of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:59:41 We need more half block wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 08:59:57 And more wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:00:56 And some kind of half cutter-like block for when you wanna make a triangle.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:01:35 Also some kind of twin-axis wing block.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:02:43 Deleting block
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:02:57 Block that deletes itself when pressing a button.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:03:21 And levers too
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:03:40 We need a proper flight stick
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:03:48 And rudder pedals
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:03:50 And a yoke
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:03:57 And a steering wheel
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:04:10 And literally all kinds of controls.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:04:34 And one that is a half version
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:04:44 For 1 block wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:05:13 We need reversible water propellers

plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:07:01 Also for control surfaces we need auto controlled with manual override.
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:08:20 Add spars to the wings to reinforce them.

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:33:07 Hey
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:34:33 Would independent control on multiple engine aircraft disqualify it as an aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:36:12 Like so independent engine control wouldn't be allowed?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:37:32 Independent engine control mainly effects the yaw of an aircraft and would really only be used for ground-based purposes of tight steering or in the case where the plane has suffered damage that affects how it flies.

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 20:43:14 He even added a frame to the canopy he knows how to motorlock.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 20:47:57 Oh cool he made a tutorial B-29 but modified it as well and added those blockbuster bombs and I think an interior.

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 20:55:16 Although I don't understand why the radiator is literally inside one of the piston cylinders on the engines.

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:00:29 It looks like he's lagging a lot.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:00:43 Also the wreckage almost looks like a plane.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:00:56 I'm not lagging at all.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:01:21 That's not my plane.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:01:39 That kid probably either has poor graphics card or low memory.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:02:22 If I asked you if you could identify what the wreckage was, you could probably guess a plane, but probably not what type of plane.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:05:19 wow this kid is actually big brain
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:05:31 Flaps on a biplane.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:06:17 Only big brain people understand the idea of flaps on aircraft.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:06:48 Those are called ailerons and elevators.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:07:07 Flaps are the drag/lift control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:07:21 Well, motor flaps is what we call them.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:07:31 But they're called control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:08:28 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_control_surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:08:50 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics)
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:09:18 He understands what both of those things are.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:09:54 Flight control surfaces change lift to be positive or negative on a wing plane to affect the plane's trajectory.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:10:09 Flaps increase drag and lift to change stall speed.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:10:20 And do a whole bunch of other things.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:10:44 War Thunder combat flaps moment.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:13:06 Funny how in War Thunder you have to constantly use your flaps in combat and what not meanwhile IRL many aircraft only had 2 flap settings, down and up, like the Spitfire for example.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:13:38 Spitfire flaps are only good for landing, because the wings give it stupid good steering.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:14:52 And with planes that did have more than 2 flap settings, it would likely just be takeoff flaps as an additional setting.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:15:29 And if flaps did have a "combat flaps" setting it usually wasn't used much in combat because, well, your hands are on the throttle and stick.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:15:48 And you're paying attention to what's around you and in front of you.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:16:03 War Thunder logic.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:16:11 WEP and flaps.
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:17:12 Although even in WT full throttle isn't always the best power setting because obviously overheating engines but also when climbing sometimes it's better to throttle down to like 90-95% power.

general 2021-03-10 04:18:46 The only 7.0 planes I can fight in a P-51C are jet planes, because the prop planes have turn times shorter than mine.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:12:14 ooo a ball joint would be really useful for something like small machine gun turrets.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:13:42 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:13:55 It would also be really useful for like rotating retracting gear
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:14:07 Like something on the P-36/P-40 or F4U.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:14:42 Unless it's for a challenge.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:14:49 But there's no rank for fuel.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:15:45 Interestingly enough, the amount of fuel in a fuel tank affects your center of mass and as the fuel drops while you fly you get lighter and the center of mass shifts.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:15:57 Even though nobody uses them.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:16:24 Fuel tanks are quite realistic despite the fact that almost no one uses then.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:17:35 Just like place some fuel tanks in different parts of a light aircraft and see how it affects your flight characteristics and turn on fuel and as the fuel drops see how that changes your flight characteristics.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:18:21 Fuel tank level can affect takeoff speed and run, turn time, climb rate, bruh, these blocks nobody uses are so realistic lol.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:18:50 The only non-realistic part is that they work when disconnected.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:19:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:20:13 the only way to fix large air craft running out of fuel is to cram a million fuel tank blocks into a single space
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:20:29 which is really unrealistic and impairs you heavily lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:20:50 if fuel tanks had more use maybe it would be a good idea if we could place them on wings
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:22:45 Fuel tanks should catch fire when hit.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:22:52 Burn planes down.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:22:56 What if
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:02 A way to make planes realistic.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:12 Like using spars to support wings
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:25 And using engines to power propellers.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:51 And controlling control surfaces with cables.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:17 Here's a cool idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:22 Structural support.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:25 Spars
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:31 Made of wood or metal
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:47 Wood is weaker, flammable, lighter.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:28:01 If there's a Plane Crazy overhaul then things like structural support with wood/metal spars, engines that generate power instead of thrust, control cables to link up control surfaces and configure how they behave automatically, larger control surfaces without the needs of motorlock/servo motors, a use for fuel, etc. would be decent ideas.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:28:21 Also in addition to that wings produce less drag and slightly less lift.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:30:06 Biplanes are ridiculously unstable in this game and have a natural tendency to go into an upwards stall because the two wings creates an insane amount of lift but there's so much drag produced from a single wings so when both wings are combined they plane pitches into a steep upward climb before stalling and falling backwards.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:30:19 REDUCE THE DRAG ON WING PANELS
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:31:05 I actually like have to default my elevator on biplanes to the down pitch position because otherwise I can't fly it.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:32:55 Also there should be some kind of crosswing and t-wing thing that would be useful for things such as tailplanes on the tailfin, tailplanes and tailfins that combine, and bomb tails for small bombs.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:33:30 I don't want to have to motorlock every single bomb where I want it to have a decent looking tail.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:34:15 Also wing struts would be a cool addition too.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:34:26 These would be similar to spars.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:34:31 But exposed.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:34:50 You know what would be funny.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:36:21 If planes had speed limits dependent on their shape that if they exceeded would cause wing flutter and if they went faster than this would just tear their wings off.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:36:53 Like some kind of Sea Meteor ripping its wings in level flight kind of shit.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:38:00 Shredder bugs would disintegrate because they have no structural integrity with their tiny-ass wing stubs on sticks.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:39:05 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:39:21 And an idea for ground-based and water-based vehicles.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:39:26 Transmission.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:39:40 Like earlier with my idea of engines.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:39:56 Transmission can be used to power wheels/water propellers.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:40:11 Guided missiles are more rigid in shape.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:40:29 Shredder bugs bend and have no control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:40:58 The guided missiles use control surfaces or gimbals to control their flight.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:41:48 Also what if airfoil.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:42:11 Like you could have wings that looked like actual wings instead of flat sheets of paper.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:44:24 without needing that.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:44:49 And like the airfoil shape affects how your plane flies in a realistic way.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:45:00 Also
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:14:41 Someone make a flying toilet but better than mine.

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 14:58:31 most helis in this game use super rockets to make the rotor spin
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 14:58:46 and you can control the rotor speed with that
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 14:59:27 this is like the first time i made a heli so huey
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 14:59:33 because vietnam

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 15:01:08 also make sure blades are in up pitch to take off
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 15:01:47 or else you'll either not move up because 0 pitch or if pitch negative will be grounded

plane-crazy 2021-03-18 21:55:02 Although small aircraft like biplanes are often upscaled
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 21:58:59 Technically the way motorlocking works is a bug.
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:00:19 Locked motors are supposed to, as the name implies, rigidly fix the position of a motor's rotation and prevent that position from being changed.
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:01:57 However, due to a bug, when loading in the locked motor will shift its position a half block into itself until powered.
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:02:57 If you turn off the powered option in the config, it won't be able to fix itself from that bugged state.

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 02:54:13 do you like how i talk
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:24:43 Shrapnel bomb? Motorlock some cutters into a gravity bomb.
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:25:59 Motorlocked bombs in general tend to have a wide particulate dispersal range due to compression.
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:26:23 So including shredders in the particulate makes the motorlocked bomb a shrapnel bomb.
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:06 What if someone made a gun that shot cutters?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:18 Bull at
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:25 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:47 A fun that shoots an APHE round
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:28:58 Basically a cutter with a tnt block on the end
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:29:46 Has someone made an APFSDS shell?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:30:08 What about APCBC?
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:31:01 APFSDS = armor piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot.
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:31:13 APHE = armor piercing high explosive
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:31:33 HEAT = high explosive anti tank
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:31:56 APCBC = armor piercing capped ballistic cap
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:32:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:32:30 HESH = high explosive squash head
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:33:06 <:APFSDS:801840700840607746>
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:33:41 APCR = armor piercing composite rigid
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:34:31 High explosive anti tank grenade.
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:40:53 APC = armor piercing cap

plane-crazy 2021-03-22 23:43:05 No like
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 23:43:19 Something the wheels would not catch on.
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 23:43:26 But a tailhook would.

plane-crazy 2021-03-24 05:06:10 How to have control over tank speed:
Speed up = decrease graphics.
Slow down = increase graphics.
Side note: your device performance must be slowed by higher graphics to work.

plane-crazy 2021-03-25 04:09:54 Extendable tail
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 04:37:02 Can it still fly?
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 04:38:07 For some reason it seems like biplane bombers have the ability to maintain level flight if their tail is cut off if there is just enough fuselage to balance it.

Sperry ball turret or something.
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:24:26 You could probably fit it into the belly of a B-17 or B-24.
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:27:49 Now make a gyro bombsight.
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:34:48 a good gyro bombsight would probably keep a constant angle to the ground regardless of aircraft pitch and would not roll with the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:35:33 and then for aiming, there would be a moving horizontal bar that would be affected by speed and pitch
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:36:02 as well as altitude
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 18:36:39 dive bombing is just use your gunsight as a bombsight

plane-crazy 2021-03-29 06:28:40 How's this for a tail gunner?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 06:30:42 The turret itself actually does work and the guns also have vertical guidance.
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 06:33:27 Only 4 machine guns can't move. The nose guns and waist guns.

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 05:50:44 You can use them in underground bases, breaking through red boxed shredders...
creations-chat 2021-04-05 05:53:10 When making large motorlocked planes I usually put most of the motorlock in an empty space in the tail, which also means in pvp the tail cutting loose really destroys the plane outright.

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 23:45:03 because ooo actual tracks means because physics engine is reverted you wil no move

help 2021-04-29 03:33:37 Okay so for aircraft if you make something like a multiple engine bomber that has separate engine control would it be disqualified for a rank?
help 2021-04-29 03:33:56 Like if you can individually power each propeller engine.
help 2021-04-29 03:34:28 I mean would it be disqualified.
help 2021-04-29 03:35:24 Separate engine control changes the yaw effect of the plane.
help 2021-04-29 03:35:29 That's the concern.
help 2021-04-29 03:35:50 Because if you unpowered the left engine the plane will yaw left.
help 2021-04-29 03:36:03 And vise versa
help 2021-04-29 03:36:22 But the plane isn't supposed to use thrust to create yaw.
help 2021-04-29 03:38:08 I mean the only real uses of separate engine control is taxing on the ground when making a tight turn on the runway or in a combat scenario where you need to shut down an engine to stop adverse yaw.

general 2021-05-02 01:18:01 Of those 30 people who died it's pretty much just the people who died in the initial explosion and those unfortunate to be in the 2 prematurely launched lifeboats that got sucked into the propellers.

plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:20:06 The belly is curved
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:21:00 Move the motor to the other side
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:21:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:21:40 It wont be on the tail end.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:22:23 If you want the bay doors to look rounded use half wedges and the top half wedge things
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:22:34 Under half blocks to make much of the bay door
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:23:06 Half wedge up to make it look more rounded
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:23:54 And use the half wedges under the wedge1 category to make small link points to prevent the bay from falling apart.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:25:20 This is an example of what the cross section of most of each bay door should roughly look like
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:25:59 You use an upside down half wedge to make the hinge part
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:26:12 And upside down half wedge up to make the bay door rounded
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:26:22 And a half wedge to mate the door to another
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:27:08 My B-17 bomb bay actually resembles somewhat like the real bomb bay.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:27:24 Even the bay doors.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:28:09 When making a bomb bay understand what the underside of the bomber should look like
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 14:28:32 And using motorlock, you should bring the bay doors inward toward each other.
general 2021-05-06 15:04:10 What's the air brake looking thing on the belly of the B-29 tail?

general 2021-05-06 15:08:01 Ignoring the 20mm tail gunner, the thing underneath the bomber, what is it?
general 2021-05-06 15:08:38 On the belly of the bomber
general 2021-05-06 15:08:52 B-29 has tricycle gear.
general 2021-05-06 15:09:17 So what is that tail flap thing?
general 2021-05-06 15:09:52 B-29 has no belly gunner
general 2021-05-06 15:10:40 Controlled by waist gunners

general 2021-05-06 15:11:04 B-29 uses a centralized fire control system.
general 2021-05-06 15:11:32 So what is that extended flap under the bomber?
general 2021-05-06 15:13:20 The B-29 has reversible propellers why would it need an air brake?

general 2021-05-06 15:15:34 Yes
general 2021-05-06 15:15:36 What is it
general 2021-05-06 15:16:40 Is it like something similar to the leading edge flaps on the SB2C that extend when the landing gear is extended?
general 2021-05-06 15:17:03 Maybe some kind of takeoff mechanism?
general 2021-05-06 15:21:45 ?
general 2021-05-06 15:24:53 That's a wire connected from the fuselage to the tail.
general 2021-05-06 15:25:02 Not the underbelly flap extension thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 01:53:06 I decided to experiment with adding shredders to tank tracks and see what it would do.
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 15:33:40 The reduced traction causes the tracks to slip, causing the tracks to damage things underneath them.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 21:32:15 Now with **widetrack** horizontal volute spring suspension.
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:27:23 Use the .9 blocks instead
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:27:27 Better grip
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:28:12 Unless you wanna do what I did and use cutters instead to turn it into a mobile chainsaw
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:28:29 Do be cool tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:32:06 Motorlock is quite an amazing thing, isn't it?

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 05:33:13 Use piston lock or motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 05:33:36 And you extend the outermost wheels outward to stretch the tracks

plane-crazy 2021-05-09 05:39:18 I modified a thin track design to have cutters turning this thing into a self-propelled chainsaw
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:03:09 Shredders try to take out tracks only to realize the tracks themselves are weaponized.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:04:19 The tracks destroy anything I run over because they slip, anything I bump into in front or behind, and anything that falls on top of them.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:05:40 Close tracking on rockets is okay if the rockets are supposed to be mini sidewinders.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:06:09 Or if you are trying to kill a shredder.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:06:18 Shredders cannot evade a close tracking rocket.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:07:26 Sometimes I have found close tracking to outright fuck me over and the rocket tries to do a 180 to kill something behind my but slams into me instead killing me.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:08:06 I can't aim using servo control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:08:47 Jet battles in plane crazy 1 hour of people doing cobras and not hitting anything.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:09:31 Meanwhile jet battles in war thunder an aim-9 from a harrier gr does a 180 into a mig-21
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:10:45 Even with close tracking on rockets jet battles in plane crazy can get dragged forever because you can't lead something going mach 1 in a turn.

plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:11:23 Interestingly enough.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:12:02 I'm actually a better at using guns on a turret in a bomber than using guns on a fighter in plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:12:31 Despite the fact that I am absolute shit as a bomber turret gunner in War Thunder.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:13:02 It's easier to lead guns on a fighter plane in war thunder than in plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:13:42 And it's easier to be a bomber gunner in plane crazy than in war thunder.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 06:14:42 I think aerial ramming used to do something to open tops in war thunder.

plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:20:59 Well
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:21:05 Duh
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:21:56 Control surfaces are based on their location relative to either center of mass or center of lift.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:22:05 Or position or something
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:22:40 Like if a control surface is in the back it will act like an elevator or rudder depending on orientation.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:23:06 Making a shredder but it uses tank treads as the cutting edge
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:23:39 And then I can armor it with tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:23:53 And then that would truly be a set of tank treads you would avoid.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:24:42 Tnt means bullets and cutters do jack shit and the cutters will cut things also tnt can be exploded as last resort.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:25:27 I did
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:25:48 2 sets of thin treads but I replaced sign blocks with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:26:13 The only downside is the lack of grip when the trapdoors are closed.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:26:25 Which makes it very difficult to maneuver in that state.
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 14:26:40 But also means it will kill

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 21:10:32 I could probably use some improvements on the HVSS
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 21:10:55 Like moving the springs in between the wheels would probably be better.
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 21:12:04 There are tutorials for tank suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 21:13:03 If you want to make a specific suspension type you should look it up.
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 21:13:56 Examples of tank suspension include Horstmann, VVSS, HVSS, leaf spring, and torsion bar in addition to Christie suspension.

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:44:01 Imagine if you didn't need wing blocks to create lift
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:44:57 And if the interior of a closed off vehicle had no effect on fluid dynamics.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:45:08 Also imagine water physics.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:45:50 That would require better water physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:46:21 Like blocks that arent pontoons or super light would need to not be bouyant
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:46:33 Also you would need water displacement physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:47:16 Unless like you're making a seaplane or speedboat pontoons have no use whatsoever.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:47:47 Or special building that too
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:47:57 But motorlock also works
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:48:23 Blocks only sink if they are denser than water
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:48:43 Most blocks in plane crazy are less dense than water
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:17 Pretty much all materials have same density
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:25 Someone did a test
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:36 Comparing characteristics of materials
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:56 The only think they didn't test was lift factor
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:04 Barely less dense
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:13 But ice has almost no friction
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:39 Ice is really good for water because it's slightly lenses dense and also has super low friction.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:52 Well using a lot will add up the effect
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:51:23 Pontoons are very buoyant though
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:51:41 They can bee used to increase a boat's speed.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:52:20 Also very important to note that because of the lack of displacement physics you really want your boat to not have a deep draught.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:52:59 My he 111 can outrun a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:53:28 My sabre is immune to any kind of shredder once airborne
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:53:48 If my b17 didnt lag it might be able to outrun a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:54:10 Thinking of making a b29 that uses prop pitch to control speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:54:46 What if a B29 somehow able to reach 450sps only on motor propellers alone?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:54:59 You'd need like 2000rpm.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:55:59 I've made a plane that could control speed by prop pitch alone using a single propeller but it needed like almost no torque to stop from going into an uncontrollable spin.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:57:25 How do you make a constant speed propeller than retains constant speed and only changes pitch depending on engine rpm?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:57:49 Irl constant speed props use oil pressure
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:00:34 Like a constant speed propeller has the same rpm no matter what but when the engine power changes the propeller pitch is what is changed.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:01:29 Br
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:02:03 I'm not sure what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:02:47 A constant speed propeller uses a piston controlled by oil pressure from engine power to change the pitch that all of the propeller blades are angled at.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:02:59 The B-29 has constant speed propellers.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:03:17 It can even reverse the propeller pitch.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:03:41 Like a fully feathering propeller.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:04:06 The propeller's rpm does not change.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:04:15 The pitch of the blades is what changes.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:04:28 Rpm is the speed the propeller spins
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:05:03 The pitch angle is how steep the propellers are angled
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:05:12 Like a low pitch would be 10°
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:05:20 And a high pitch would be 45°
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:05:50 A fully feathered propeller has a pitch of 90° and is parallel to the direction of travel
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:06:18 A 0° pitch is a propeller that has the blades parallel to the engine cylinders.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:06:36 That's for rpm
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:07:09 This is what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:08:13 Say a constant speed propeller rotates at about 3000rpm
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:08:34 At low engine power the rpm is 3000 and the prop pitch is low for higher torque
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:08:57 At max engine power the rpm is still 3000 but the pitch is much higher
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:09:51 In an engine failure either the pitch goes to 0° and the propeller windmills or feathers to 90°
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:10:36 At low pitch the power will be too strong
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:10:46 At high pitch the power will be too weak
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:10:50 That is the problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:11:53 You cant change the max torque of a motor mid use
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:11:57 It has constant torque
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:12:56 That will change the rpm
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:13:18 Also if a motor has a constant rotation speed then engines wont change power output
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:13:42 Because the power of the motor will override the engine power
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:14:40 Ok a constant speed propeller is basically the same as automatic transmission.
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:14:49 You need a torque converter
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:14:58 Which uses hydraulic pressure
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:15:00 Like oil
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 17:19:34 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-pitch_propeller_(aeronautics)

plane-crazy 2021-07-18 05:29:43 what da porche doin
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 16:32:15 I forgot to mention the coaxial machine gun but it now has a magazine for reloading.
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 16:32:31 So now i can shoot multiple shells super long range.
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 16:32:48 A machine gun that fires on the same axes as a main gun.
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 03:40:35 
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 03:40:40 
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:27:47 with an excessive amount of motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:28:04 or if you dont want to make a motorlock madness thing you just scale up the build
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:28:54 also needs detail
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:31:30 paint and markings idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:31:46 i barely even have angled lock in my p-51
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:12 lots of trails
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:16 lots of motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:19 lots of cameras
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:25 lots of text blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:33 text blocks can be very useful
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:37 they have no collision
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:41 and can connect things
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:32:51 trails
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:33:18 if you want more detail
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:33:32 but it can get complex
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:10:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:11:04 i was constantly attacked by shredders
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:11:11 and then i loaded a 4k block creation
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:11:18 and all of a sudden the attacks stopped
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:11:41 i found a way to stop shredders
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:11:48 load a land mine
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:12:01 a creation that only lags the server if you interact with it
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:12:06 they will learn to stop
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:12:12 or else lose all their frames
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:16:51 just load a nimitz class carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:00 if anyone attacks it
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:08 because it is 12309128309 blocks in size
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:15 the entire server stops working entirely
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:31 also
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:35 an effective method
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:17:59 i have a build
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:06 that is basically a steam engine
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:09 but 4k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:23 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:25 better idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:35 make 8k blocks locked into a plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:51 if you have a 8k block locked vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:18:57 it wont really lag the server when in use
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:19:04 unless someone touches it and damages it
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:19:09 and then all hell is unleashed
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:20:06 landmine method of getting rid of shredders
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:20:25 hyper motor piston locked creation
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:20:32 anyone that hurts it regrets it
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:20:59 by also kicking everyone from the server
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:21:01 pro
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:21:25 ddos the server if anyone attacks you
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:21:27 pro gamer move
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:22:00 server memory overload using motorlocke
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:22:12 and a toxic shredder bug user attacking you
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:28:24 egg
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:30:03 P-51D.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:30:22 and additional screenshot i had
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:31:07 fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 05:52:43 Ew
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 15:26:24 Someone got perm banned for saying "no"
general 2021-07-20 15:34:42 Yo when did they add zeppelins
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 16:38:38 Retro-converted my P-51D-15 into a P-51C-10.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 16:44:49 It does?
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 16:45:24 I mean the wing extends slightly in front of the cockpit and the cockpit is still in the middle on mine.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 16:46:41 P-51C and P-51D both have similar proportions.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 16:46:57 Main difference is canopy and armament.
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:02:25 oh well
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:02:31 so what
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:02:57 looks better than if i made them straight tips
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:03:27 eh
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:03:40 im busy
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 17:03:45 ill think about it later
general 2021-07-21 23:13:57 so apparently a 76mm can pen a tiger 1 mantlet?
general 2021-07-22 15:30:06 America
general 2021-07-22 15:30:34 So
general 2021-07-22 15:30:44 Not only can a 76 pen tiger 1 hull
general 2021-07-22 15:30:55 It can also pen mantlet hull gun and driver port
general 2021-07-23 21:11:20 When the stuka is placed in the hangar the props move yes
general 2021-07-23 21:12:33 Same to how b17 wings bounce when it loads in hangar
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 21:24:57 F82 landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 21:25:50 I just realized how easy it is to hide most of the lock on a typical bomber
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 21:26:06 Because usually bomber width is 3-5 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 21:27:36 I should make an m18 hellcat
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 21:27:52 But what would I replace
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 18:26:01 wow i can see so much
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 14:31:40 I added a reflex sight to the Sabre how does it look?
plane-crazy 2021-07-26 14:31:45 
general 2021-07-26 14:59:53 Holy shit
general 2021-07-26 15:00:01 Rain in the middle of California summer
general 2021-07-26 15:00:03 Real
general 2021-07-27 02:42:11 I just noticed after not dying that they uptiered B29.
general 2021-07-27 02:43:54 mostly jets now
general 2021-07-27 02:43:59 super props less common
general 2021-07-27 02:44:59 b r u h
general 2021-07-27 02:45:06 the boosters were worth it
general 2021-07-27 02:45:46 i didnt see any when i was playing
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 05:04:58 
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 23:00:23 I improved the muzzle brake design on the anti tank gun.

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:37:55 the 37mm is probably the quirkiest part of the m3 lee i made
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 17:50:31 lots of motorlock

general 2021-08-13 02:30:58 a little b17 trolling
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:37:45 yo another tank with a detachable turret
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:42:20 the turret on my m4 sherman is designed to detach
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:42:52 and one of my friends made a tiger 1 that when detaching the turret takes the turret basket as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:43:35 i mainly made the turret on my sherman detachable for fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:44:03 
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:44:22 the tank die
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:44:33 thats my friends tiger
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:45:00 a tank with an actual interior
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:45:54 e+ is basically another way of saying multiply this decimal by 10^ whatever follows the e+
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:46:19 so 5.08*10^14
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:46:54 scientific notation
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:47:38 basically what i just said
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:48:29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:49:47 so basically you reached a speed of half a quadrillion studs per second
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 03:58:59 the easiest way is to just write/type the number and move the decimal place to the right however many times the exponent is
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 03:59:04 for example
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 03:59:18 2.23812908374978e+20
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 03:59:52 223,812,908,374,978,000,000
general 2021-08-14 20:32:48 do not let the size of a b25 deceive you
general 2021-08-14 20:32:53 it is a lot tougher than it looks
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 21:30:39 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:23:49 It do be like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:58:36 Wait what the new map is infinite?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:58:56 Ooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:59:02 Minecraft but roblox
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:59:46 Yo wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:59:57 What if plane crazy farlands
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:34:25 If a wing hits a tree it gets ripped off
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:31 Rocket racks too
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:42 Carry less rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:45 Like 4-8
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:36:07 Rocket racks are better for something like say ww2 planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:36:21 Also actual cannons would be interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:37:04 Like maybe guns should be divided into machine guns small caliber autocannons and larger caliber main guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:38:33 Medium machine guns and heavy machine guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:38:49 Also guns should have recoil
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:39:35 Use as effective braking mechanism on plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:40:44 The recoil of machine guns only really has an effect on things that weigh little like planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:40:56 But imagine if there were ship cannons with recoil
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:41:18 The hmg would just be the current gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:41:55 Because currently the gun ingame rn is basically a 50 cal
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:42 Also actual armor other than tnt would be neat
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:53 1mm steel
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:43:04 1mm bulletproof glass
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:43:23 Materials have no impact on damage resistance
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:58:33 the trollage begins
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:13:57 i added those spring cylinder things to this flak gun i made
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:06 whatever the hell these things actually are
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:38 not the recoil cylinders the twin horizontal cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:55 they are also on the super pershing
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:16:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:16:39 on both they seem to have something to do with aiming the gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:16:54 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:01 they arent gunsights
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:13 gaijin says they are vertical aiming drives
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:29 i used sparklers to make the thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:42 i added those twin cylinder things already
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:47 but i dont actually know what they are
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:59 they are round
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:18:12 also disconnectors are too big
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:19:25 oh heres an diagram
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:19:50 so it appears the twin horizontal cylinders on the flak gun and super pershing are balancing springs or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:20:36 because those guns dont really have a counterweight i guess?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:21:38 no its not that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:21:55 the guns use electric aiming drives
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:22:27 but it looks like the forward weight of the barrel with the lack of a counterweight means a counterspring is needed to balance it out
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:22:39 otherwise it would be difficult to aim it vertically
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:54:47 present on the super pershing as well because of the length of the barrel and weight of the additional mantlet and ears
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:55:17 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:55:49 water is wet if there is something that isnt water in it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:55:55 which is most water
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:06:59 
general 2021-08-26 01:34:22 i have only played this thing for one match and i already almost spaded it
general 2021-08-26 01:40:43 this is why
general 2021-08-26 01:41:24 i main america
general 2021-08-26 01:42:40 the highest br plane i have is a sabre and the highest br tank i have is between a 76 sherman and m36 jackson
general 2021-08-26 01:44:32 pew
general 2021-08-26 01:45:28 f-86f-25 still has the 50 cals
general 2021-08-26 01:45:34 f-2 has 4 20mms i believe
general 2021-08-26 01:46:39 pee
general 2021-08-26 01:48:50 they uptiered the b-29 from 7.0 to 7.3
general 2021-08-26 01:51:15 though if you have a shell that can pen the under armor in one shot but not both the armor and boilerplate you can kill the super pershing by just repeatedly shooting the same spot or something
general 2021-08-26 01:53:37 a m8 greyhound can pen the side armor of a tiger 2
general 2021-08-27 14:25:32 Hmm
general 2021-08-27 14:26:37 I'm assuming they store the spent casings the way tanks do.
general 2021-08-27 14:27:54 I don't think that's an option.
general 2021-08-27 15:35:32 Separate compartment
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 04:28:31 i made a few more modifications to the flak gun on my flak bus

plane-crazy 2021-08-29 18:02:09 Planning on putting it inside a B-25
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 18:07:05 making thing merge together
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 18:12:24 this tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 18:12:28 is made with motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 18:13:51 basically you can use it to make things like steering wheels and larger control surfaces
creations-chat 2021-09-04 19:20:13 thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 19:38:38 simplicity, i might cover them later, and if i want to i can add tracks but those significantly slow down the tank

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:31:51 so uhhh im working on something...
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:36:01 i have plans
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:36:36 currently a comically long modified landship
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:37:11 with empty space for a cylindrical object to be lowered into
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:40:50 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:41:03 if you have a comically landship body
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:41:09 but a comically large turret on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 03:06:02 j
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:49:40 thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:52:00 The cannon recoils but has less elevation than the coaxial machine gun.
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:52:48 Main gun about +/-20° elevation coax +/-30°.
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:53:43 I'm not home rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:53:57 It's part of a larger thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 23:54:27 Separately built because it makes it easier to make.

plane-crazy 2021-09-10 05:01:14 main problem with it though is the other sprocket is still able to spin so it takes power away to doing jack shit

plane-crazy 2021-09-13 14:03:54 From my knowledge the corsair used very large propellers to maximize the efficiency of the large radial engine.

plane-crazy 2021-09-13 14:04:49 The propellers on a corsair are like the size of the propellers on a b17
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 14:05:34 The corsair basically has a b17 engine on a fighter plane in other words
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 14:05:59 Maybe use the propeller block

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:20:44 How to stop shredders: leave
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:21:12 They won't have anything to attack
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:21:31 If everyone from a server leaves the shredders has no use
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:22:08 Don't make a lag machine

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:23:44 Like legit not only was gameplay impossible even after the lag machine was gone the server couldn't load builds or shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:24:06 And it took like 2 minutes to leave for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:24:41 Like the client with the broken server was still running while I was in a different game

plane-crazy 2021-10-07 05:36:28 Okay I sacrificed the gun elevation angle from 60 degrees to 30 so it's semi-proportional and made the shells a more reasonable size.
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 05:39:27 The turret is 11 blocks wide with a turret ring about 10 blocks wide.
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 05:41:08 Custom but somewhat based sorta off a cross between a Sherman and a Bulldog.

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 23:44:38 Thing.
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:17:00 Does +40/-10 degrees elevation sound appropriate?
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 23:19:14 Think TOG
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:17:38 question
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:17:54 has anyone made a proper vertical/horizontal/2-plane stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:18:02 like not just speed 50 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:18:29 like the gun actually traverses at a normal speed like 1
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:18:46 but when the tank bumps the gun stays pointed at the target
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:19:00 something like a sherman stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 04:24:08 i wonder if i use a ballast/helium block on a pivot i could isolate the gun from the body
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 18:44:12 Water TOG-like tank.

general 2021-12-21 01:04:09 Basically if you ever played simulator battles all air simulator battles are enduring confrontation.
general 2021-12-21 01:04:22 The map is like 100km by 100km
general 2021-12-21 01:04:35 And you have objectives to do.

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 05:28:24 thinking of working on making a new tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 22:38:05 more development on the turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:30:34 
creations-chat 2021-12-22 18:13:30 i began making hull
creations-chat 2021-12-22 18:22:06 it is nowhere near complete, and i have yet to add decorations to the hull so
creations-chat 2021-12-22 19:25:26 better? i will add the rear segment of the hull and tracks later
creations-chat 2021-12-22 19:29:49 for what? its just a wip, is it too wide?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 20:39:15 more power
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:25:10 So I got bored and decided to make a tank gun.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:28:29 First I got to think of a turret. Kind of thinking Pershing turret.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:32:32 The only notable thing about the tank gun I made is that it can recoil.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:45:16 Not yet
help 2021-12-23 23:40:15 you can fins
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 23:30:50 I turned the tank gun into an anti-tank gun with a coaxial machine gun.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:39:33 Is this good for a player-sized medium tank turret?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:43:39 The turret is lopsided to accommodate the 3 crew members.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:45:42 alternative lopsided turret design
creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:57:44 I made it not lopsided and added hatches and radio antennae. Better?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:01:02 no more like late interwar/early ww2
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:03:22 And that's what the extension thing is supposed to cover, because I cannot push the gun back half a block without removing the commander and completely redesigning the positions of the gunner and loader
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:12:54 okay, this better? the weird protrusion in front of the gunner hatch is required for the redesign to work, you can take with that what you want
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:25:11 periscopes too? now does it look like a proper tank turret?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:29:04 which hole
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:39:10 well this is the best i can do without having a elevation of 0 degrees and i also added a crude turret basket
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:42:45 none of the crew actually sit in the basket
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:46:37 in fact because of that fact that all the crew fit outside the basket i have made the turret basket the ammo rack
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:51:17 carousel ammo rack like the valentine tank except it's an even smaller rack because the turret is large enough to house the entire crew, therefor there is no need for a wide basket and i can fit the turret on a narrower tank
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:56:36 does the gun elevate though?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 04:01:07 Guys I built an F-15
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:28:24

plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:33:25 
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:33:46 flak bus bus with a long long long long gun
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:35:55 you should use something to make it so the gun doesnt look completely separated from the breech and mantlet
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:36:05 like a disconnector or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:36:38 that doesnt look like a tiger 1 hull
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:36:48 it looks like the prototype for the tiger 2
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 07:38:04 so that but with a krupp prototype turret
creations-chat 2021-12-25 22:10:32 progress
general 2021-12-26 01:45:01 is it time for revenge?
creations-chat 2021-12-26 22:56:32 hull and turret complete, time to add tracks or something
creations-chat 2021-12-27 02:23:57 hull without the tracks, the tracks will be wide and the hull will extend over tracks once they are built
creations-chat 2021-12-28 06:44:19 I finally made a recoiling tank cannon with a coaxial machine gun and gunsight that can be mounted in a medium tank, I believe.
creations-chat 2021-12-28 07:16:02 and this time the crew will be partially inside the turret basket instead of on top of it
creations-chat 2021-12-28 07:20:16 my behemoth tog3-like tank had 3 of the 4 turret crew sitting inside the turret above the basket because the tank is very large, the medium/heavy tank i was previously making had all 3 crew sitting above the basket which was instead used as an ammo rack, so in a way yes this is the first time i made a tank turret with all the crew sitting inside the actual turret basket
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 07:22:37 lmao

help 2021-12-28 07:33:41 in a way it would serve as both
help 2021-12-28 07:34:55 see, what if you want the gun to not be driven by a speed 50 motor 2
help 2021-12-28 07:35:34 nah

help 2021-12-28 07:36:34 even speed 50 motor is not stabilized
help 2021-12-28 07:37:35 there is definitely a way to make a reaction based stabilizer
help 2021-12-28 07:38:33 i made my anti tank gun self propelled
help 2021-12-28 07:39:18 originally meant to be a tank gun but way too large, so just put the whole mounting with sight and coax gun on 2 wheel gun chassis
help 2021-12-28 07:40:04 see, by putting a machine gun on the anti tank gun you can both take out tanks and infantry at the same time
help 2021-12-28 07:40:59 
creations-chat 2021-12-28 08:29:20 i just did
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 08:33:36 I got bored so I decided to "improve" the mantlet on Thrizet's tutorial M1A2 for fun.
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 08:44:56 the turret is lopsided <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-12-28 09:00:44 
creations-chat 2021-12-28 19:44:34 progress with probably one of the more weird designs for a mantlet
creations-chat 2021-12-28 19:47:24 alternative mantlet, is this one better?
creations-chat 2021-12-28 19:50:04 or how about this mantlet? all three allow for +/- 22.5 degrees of elevation
creations-chat 2021-12-28 20:14:45 turret is now complete using the 3rd mantlet design
creations-chat 2021-12-28 20:33:45 not really a pershing turret, it's a custom tank turret
creations-chat 2021-12-28 20:55:45 now with 20 shells in the basket, <@!527092191189925918>  no it is not a kv 1 it is just a random custom tank i made
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 00:30:11 
creations-chat 2021-12-29 05:15:52 work on hull
creations-chat 2021-12-29 05:18:59 the forward sponsons will carry ammo, the rear sponsons will have fuel tanks
creations-chat 2021-12-29 05:22:24 a sponson is a protrusion from the hull, for example the part of a hull overextending the tracks, or an extension to mount a gun such as on the mark1-5 series and m3 lee, it can also apply to ships such as a torpedo bulge or side gun, on planes it's an additional short wing
creations-chat 2021-12-29 06:32:21 added fuel tanks and more interior paint, oh and when i finish the hull i'm going to make a crane to put the turret onto the hull like i did with my tog3 thing
creations-chat 2021-12-29 06:56:16 like this
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:08:36 which is yes the tank i made with that can do this
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:38:52 narrow tracks that are extremely long allow it to cross narrow flat bridges without the over 100 tons of steel causing the bridge to collapse (for reference my pt boat at the same scale is smaller and shorter)
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:40:55 even better i can actually modify the hull to have an aircraft carrier deck <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:44:54 if you want to use it as a super heavy infantry support tank you can, if you want to use it as an aircraft carrier or bridge you can, if you want to put an fv4005 turret on it you can (fun fact the fv4005 turret doesn't have a turret basket because of the height)
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:47:59 people crying when they see exposed motors on the wings and tail to allow for functional controls surfaces well my tfb avenger does have working ailerons and flaps and i managed to hide the motors responsible for those in the fuselage but as you can see in order to do that you need control cables
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:52:55 marked the control cable and aileron said conrol cable, this is why people just use an exposed motor
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:56:38 oh yeah, and btw 9 graphics may look visually better than 10 graphics
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:59:42 nope, radar is more round and usually mounted in a more exposed area like on top of the vehicle or in the direction of attention like the nose of a plane
creations-chat 2021-12-29 08:04:18 mustang with airbrakes (btw does anyone actually put airbrakes on aircraft that would use them) 

<@!718409831639154718> not sure anymore

help 2021-12-29 08:23:58 heavy ballast along the keel of the ship (bottom centerline), use helium on the sides of the hull above the waterline
creations-chat 2021-12-29 11:29:38 i made it so it is possible for the turret crew to move from one seat to another without opening the hatches (though the commander has a little trouble trying to get down into either the loader's or gunner's seat), as well as possible to move inside and outside the turret through the turret basket
creations-chat 2021-12-29 19:38:58 should the tracks be 1, 1.5, or 2 blocks wide?
creations-chat 2021-12-29 19:44:31 I am not going to do any piston locking
general 2021-12-31 21:57:24 does btd6 have crossplay?

general 2022-02-04 14:45:54 Nobody doesn't use afterburner
general 2022-02-04 14:46:22 Every jet player takes a full tank and uses afterburner 24/7
general 2022-02-04 14:46:42 Sraam can do that
general 2022-02-04 14:47:06 It can tho I have seen it do that
general 2022-02-04 14:47:36 And I have been on the side where an sraam from an enemy harrier in front of me did a 180 at rammed my tail somehow
general 2022-02-04 14:48:17 I don't record all the games I play
general 2022-02-04 14:48:28 I am laptop gamer
general 2022-02-04 14:48:55 Just look up some harrier gr gameplay
general 2022-02-04 14:49:06 You will see it do all aspect shit
general 2022-02-04 14:49:38 Because gaijin doesn't understand how fair gameplay works
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 14:51:16 One wheel landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 14:51:18 Bruh
general 2022-02-04 14:53:14 You not see it all
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 14:53:56 Motorlock to offset a pair of landing gear half a block?
general 2022-02-04 14:54:21 Clearly you don't gaming
general 2022-02-04 14:55:17 It's as good as all aspect by how well it locks onto afterburners
general 2022-02-04 14:55:35 More or less all aspect
general 2022-02-04 14:55:37 End
general 2022-02-04 14:55:58 Basically all aspect
general 2022-02-04 14:56:57 Look if people can headon kill with aim9bs sraam can headon any jet
general 2022-02-04 14:57:36 Simply a difference in skill it is more or less all aspect
general 2022-02-04 14:59:08 But harrier gr is a 60 dollar premium so therefor what was a nearly all aspect missile is now in effect all aspect
general 2022-02-04 15:00:04 Doesn't matter it's a 60 dollar plane so it gets buffed to have all aspect regardless of what it says
general 2022-02-04 15:00:27 Gaijin says the t26e5 only has 101.6mm frontal armor
general 2022-02-04 15:00:54 It actually has thicker armor than tiger 2
general 2022-02-04 15:02:23 According to the card anything can frontal pen a t26e5, but nothing but leopards can pen
general 2022-02-04 15:02:29 At its br
general 2022-02-04 15:03:09 Yeah well gaijin says t26e5 has same armor as jumbo and normal pershing on the card
general 2022-02-04 15:03:24 Clearly it doesn't because a tiger 2 can't frontal pen
general 2022-02-04 15:03:32 Same angle
general 2022-02-04 15:03:45 Actually
general 2022-02-04 15:04:14 Pershing has worse angle than jumbo at 45-46° rather than 47° of jumbo
general 2022-02-04 15:05:15 Gaijin put wrong number on the card because it has 6in frontal armor angled
general 2022-02-04 15:05:49 And also has apparently 2 ghost periscopes
general 2022-02-04 15:06:55 They just took a pershing made the frontal armor thicker but forgot to tell everyone it actually has thicker armor on the card
general 2022-02-04 15:12:02 Okay lemme just open war thunder on my cell phone
general 2022-02-04 15:17:25 
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 05:43:40 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 05:48:32 made by the friend who made thin tiger
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 05:49:57 at least they widened the hull when changing the turret
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 05:59:46 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 05:59:55 how do the driver fit
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:00:02 there is like
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:00:06 no hull thickness
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:14:02 No like there isn't even room to lay down
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:14:21 The hull isn't long enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:15:31 Also if you look at the position of the driver's hatch it's set as close to the turret as possible
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:15:50 And clearly very far from the front of the hull
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:16:10 But on the super cursed flat hull the drivers hatch isn't that far back
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:16:49 Abrams driver actually has pretty decent room
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:16:56 And I think the seat is adjustable
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:17:09 You aren't laying flat
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:17:33 You're sitting in a very reclined chair as an abrams driver
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:18:41 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:18:54 Centurion doesn't have a telescopic gunsight
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:19:31 Despite on the centurion mark 1 there being a slit to allow for one to the right of the mantlet
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:20:04 However on the centurion mark 3 and other later models the telescopic sight slit is completely removed
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 06:20:29 And they all rely on periscopes as the main sighting method for the gun
general 2022-02-08 04:03:28 wanna see a magic trick?
general 2022-02-08 04:03:43 ​​
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 05:43:20 decided to start putting a white interior paint on the super tog
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 06:34:41 Wait so
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 06:35:01 Pc2 will be more efficient with save data?
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 06:37:53 No?
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 06:38:05 Or is uh
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:10:32 I know how to use piston lock but don't make use of it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:10:43 Use a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:10:45 More smooth
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:10:55 Bigger cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:11:00 2×2
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:11:27 1×1 cylinder is too small for your scale jet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:12:06 I'm not using x I'm using ×
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:12:18 Multiplication sign.
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:12:35 2•2 cylinder.
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:13:21 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:13:29 You can raise it up higher
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:13:42 By half a block it seems
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:14:00 Nice radiator
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:15:13 I'm considering making a Centurion Mk.3 with an interior.
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:15:45 You got to identify if the cylinder is in contact with anything preventing a lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:16:20 Preferably use the non centered 2×2 cylinder motorlocked to be centered as it has a smaller profile.
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:16:45 Centered 2×2 has a 3 block connecting profile face compared to non centered 2×2
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:17:21 You use 2 motors to lock it into the middle
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:17:39 One to lock it half a block horizontally and one to lock it half a block vertically
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:18:09 Make sure your locking mechanism doesn't contact the cylinders except where needed.
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:18:49 You may need to make a redesign if necessary
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:20:07 Are you planning on making the canopy transparent or functional and able to be opened?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:20:25 You can use that as your room for motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:21:08 Try to figure out if you can compress your build
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:21:23 You can also use side motorlocking to create a new tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:21:56 From which you can add new components onto the extra motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:22:40 If you don't want to redesign add a side locking tower that feeds into another tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:22:50 There is a tutorial on side motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:23:05 Horizontal space
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:23:12 You have horizontal space
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:23:30 Or on that side lock tower you made already
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:23:48 You can use that side locked tower as the base for a new tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:23:56 Like for the side parts of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:24:21 The unpainted sideways motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:24:37 You can use that for a new motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:25:17 Trying to figure out how to explain
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:25:28 You make your motorlock like a tree branch
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:25:35 There's the main motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:25:56 And then a sideways motorlock tower that feeds into a branch
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:26:45 Like the number 4 but with the ends disconnected
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:27:04 Instead of like resembling an Æ
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:28:20 It's harder to explain as I am on a phone in the middle of transit
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:28:46 You attach it onto the sideways motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:28:54 Directly onto the sideways lock in front or behind
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 14:30:27 If I could show an example I would
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 00:32:03 ah man i can't get matched against 1.0 tanks who are incapable of dealing with me

plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:28:15 What if bulletproof glass?
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:32:08 The slit was originally significantly larger and had an impractical hatch with no glass screen of any kind.
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:36:46 taken straight from the rhomboid design
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:37:00 and made them conveyors so they function
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:08:12 what if i make a turret that rests on rollers and isn't physically connected to the mount

plane-crazy 2022-03-06 14:11:34 Turn it into an elefant
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 14:13:59 Making a barbette for the turret?
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:34:01 Should I made disappearing guns?
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:49:20 "Kinda"
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:50:00 Legit the drag coefficient on wing blocks is like 178× higher than irl
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:50:11 Hi
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:50:37 Unpowered aircraft immediately stall
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:51:00 And they do not fall very fast when stalled
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:54:57 Water drag is also insanely high
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:55:06 And so is buoyancy
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:55:22 That's called center of mass
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:55:49 If the landing gear has a significant mass they will change the center of mass
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:56:09 Even if they don't use any kind of wing blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:56:20 There is also torque
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:56:54 The combined change in center of mass to further downward and the torque from moving the landing gear tip the aircraft down
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:57:14 Most noticable on like say the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:58:29 I don't believe non wing blocks are affected by drag in the air, are they?
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:59:27 Would be nice if pc2 had better aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 15:59:37 Also if more technical stuff
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:00:14 I would like to see some kind of epicyclic/planetary gear mechanism, along with other gears
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:00:58 Your build would actually have to look like an aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:01:23 Troll the shredder bugs by adding aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:01:33 Ooo
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:01:39 Adding a gimbal
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:02:03 Or some kind of ball-and-socket thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:02:24 Add door handles

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 04:18:55 disappearing
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 04:41:52 added little ring around barbette to make the gun a little less exposed
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:01:40 to be used on something
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:04:54 ? i made the barrel using sparklers
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:06:04 yeah this is non pvp build tho and i making it uh recoil barrel
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 05:04:07 A dual mount 5in/38 turret but the guns are mounted too close to each other so it looks wrong.
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 05:43:12 so
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 05:43:20 are cameras just completely broken now?
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 14:57:04 Use motorlock and cover it up with disconnected or trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:15:34 lopsided turret 👍
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:16:25 heheheha
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:16:30 fun fact
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:16:38 all churchill turrets are lopsided
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:16:50 heavily asymmetrical
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:17:21 the gun on the m18 hellcat is not only mounted off the centerline, it is inclined slightly to the left
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:17:41 (probably has something to do with uh sight calibrating)
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:18:00 centurions have periscopic gunsights

<@!694804483427008592> does it have interior?
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:47:44 room, but where?
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:52:00 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:52:09 but i'm not trapped really
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 19:52:17 because there is both an entrance and an exit
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 23:56:48 aa gun inspired by 1.1"/75 chicago piano
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:00:41 use text blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:00:42 like
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:00:49 1*2
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:01:27 connect them with a text block on the side of them
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:06:49 Here's a demonstration of how you can connect sparklers with text blocks and which faces work. First one has no text block connecting and the other 4 have the side they are connected to by text block
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:07:35 useful thing about text blocks is they have no collision
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:09 they can be used for all sorts of things
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:20 connecting two things invisibly
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:25 like parts of a turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:31 or parts of an axle
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:47 only thing about text blocks is
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:08:53 they only weld on the back face
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:10:01 machine gun blocks weld on all 6 sides, like normal blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 00:11:12 trapdoors weld only on the side, but not on the knob edge
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 04:00:29 pianist
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 14:35:36 Does anyone actually put flaps on their aircraft or do they just have a no flaps plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 15:35:34 Used as air brakes
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 15:39:20 Someone should make landing gear that function like air brakes
general 2022-03-18 03:20:04 so this is why people play wows

plane-crazy 2022-03-18 13:34:32 Wait so if you turn on toggle on motor 2s without turning on servo you can make them lock in place?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 13:35:00 Like basically have a gun point in a direction and then lock it there?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:41:41 So how long would a 330 foot long ship be in pc?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:41:48 100 blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:42:40 100 meters
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:43:00 Meters into blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:43:17 At 100 meters long
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:43:23 How many blocks is that
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:43:46 What is the length of the plot again?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:44:34 So basically 135 blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 14:45:05 So a 98 meter long ship is 140 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:35:47 Make a t34 and cover it in 3rd us army armored division livery
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:36:00 And call it an m34 pershing
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:36:36 No, call it an M34
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:36:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:37:00 Because the American T34 is a heavy tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:37:22 Instead of Test 34 Tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:37:28 Model 34 Tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:37:41 T is for test model
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:37:48 M is for production model
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 15:38:03 Idk anymore

plane-crazy 2022-03-19 04:57:04 i forgot how to make balanced ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 04:57:22 so that a submarine dives bow first and also rises bow first
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 05:12:37 But how do I keep it level when submerged
creations-chat 2022-03-19 16:37:52 how's this for a start to making a submarine?

plane-crazy 2022-03-20 02:15:56 How's this for a submarine bow?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 02:22:02 wait those aren't motorlocks i just forgot to activate the disconnectors

plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:05:18 while making my sub a friend decided to build a destroyer
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:08:20 my sub isnt done yet
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:08:28 no superstructure
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:01:19 Helium and ballast tanks are valid for ships right?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:02:25 I mean the purpose of helium in ships is for stabilization
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:03:04 Yeah you absolutely most definitely need ballast tanks for submarines unless you make it a vtol sub
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:03:31 Helium to prevent the ship from constantly capsizing
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:03:34 Also
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:04:26 The mass and buoyancy of a box fold setup on one side of the ship can be enough to lock it in a specific list angle and possibly capsize it
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:05:02 So putting an opposite one that doesnt connect to anything would balance it right?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:06:48 Yeah only really aircraft and rockets and vtol disqualify helium
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:57:41 wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:57:53 what is the diameter of a sparkler?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:58:18 is it actually .5 blocks in diameter?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 22:58:25 or slightly larger?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 23:07:10 So the cylindrical part of a sparkler is equal to or less than .5 blocks in diameter
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 23:07:26 As you can make a slit out of sparklers and fit another sparkler in it
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 02:58:01 aa gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 02:59:09 bofors 40mm
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 02:59:15 its a really long aa gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:00:06 what do you want me to do
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:00:12 shorten the aa gun by 1 block?
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:02:07 is this better length?
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:08:38 too laggy
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:08:53 ?
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:12:09 i mean i want functionality
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:12:16 it's just an aa gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:12:23 and i'm going to add 3 more guns
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 03:26:34 other aa gun made
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 14:36:13 Anyone got a good model or something of the wet mount 5"/25 used on US submarines?

creations-chat 2022-03-29 23:12:08 thoughts?
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:29:00 Thoughts on this so far?
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:29:30 5"/25 wet mount
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:29:40 For use on US submarines
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:29:47 it can
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:29:50 and it has recoil
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:30:42 i use a very simple recoiling gun with breech system
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:30:58 it uses a spring as the gun breech and recoil system
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:31:28 it's not supposed to
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:31:36 I'm building the USS Cod
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:32:16 Actually I believe a few US submarines had retractable deck guns
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:32:22 Like
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:32:35 The deck gun would be lowered into the hull pointing straight up
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:32:52 and a hatch would seal it up with only the waterproof barrel sticking out
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 03:34:15 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_M-1_(SS-47)
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 14:39:09 wait so it was mounted with both 5 inch and 4 inch gun or the 5 inch gun replaced the 4 inch gun?
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 15:58:26 exterior more or less complete, moved the 5 inch gun to behind the conning tower
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 15:59:36 well, it *does* have control surfaces, so if you were to hypercharge the propellers it might be able to fly

contest-chat 2022-03-31 01:59:45 But a dual-purpose gun would work?
contest-chat 2022-03-31 01:59:56 It is designed for both anti ship and aa.
contest-chat 2022-03-31 02:00:18 Take, a 5"/25, 5"/38, etc.

contest-chat 2022-03-31 02:01:11 what if it's a joke
general 2022-03-31 02:13:56 why is my plane emitting thin white smoke trails?
general 2022-03-31 02:14:05 new feature to indicate no ordnance?
general 2022-03-31 02:14:57 i mean
general 2022-03-31 02:15:12 it only started emitting the thin white smoke once i used my last bullets
general 2022-03-31 02:15:28 and the smoke only disappeared once i got close to airfield
general 2022-03-31 02:38:39 what are those side skeleton wing things on the back of the submarine
general 2022-03-31 02:38:54 us ww2 destroyers also had them for some reason
general 2022-03-31 02:41:59 but really what is it and why?
general 2022-03-31 03:06:44 how's this at replicating it?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:04:44 How do I make a stable torpedo?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:05:04 And how do I keep it stable when it has guidance?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:05:14 Homing torpedo
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:05:19 How
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:06:02 I'm gonna have torpedoes on my submarine
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:06:11 With only one reload available
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:06:42 It has to fit in a 1×1 torpedo tube
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:07:03 And be no longer than 7 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:07:23 And be stable when using homing into the target
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:08:41 Is there a way to make a torpedo have a contact detonator?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:09:03 Or will it just garuntee explode underwater when it reaches the impact speed?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:12:13 What if it comes in contact with a ship below the water line?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:12:41 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:13:22 So if it goes above it's detonation speed underwater, it won't explode until it hits a ship or reaches the surface?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:13:34 No, my submarine is too large.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:13:56 I'm just making USS Cod and want working homing torpedoes on it.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:14:32 Although it will only have 4 working forward torpedo tubes and while I will add aft torpedo room it will only be decorative.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:16:12 Huh, using this logic couldn't you make a naval mine with contact detonation if you made it sensitive enough?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:17:14 Like
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 14:17:56 If a ship bumps into the mine and pushes it at a fast enough speed in the collision, wouldn't that cause the mine to explode because it is in contact with the ship and moving fast enough?

plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:12:37 "Detonation"
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:13:27 It only propels in water so a bomb that can move in water
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:13:44 if you drop it on land its a bomb
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:13:51 if you drop it in water its a torpedo
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:14:17 a torpedo isnt the most effective bomb
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:15:13 an aerial torpedo isnt very effective as a bomb, considering even as a torpedo it may struggle to significantly damage battleships
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:15:56 meanwhile you got usn mk 14 torpedoes for submarines that can literally ricochet off the target without detonating
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:17:15 not me
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:18:03 but i do make small scale cannons that can recoil
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 04:24:50 this might be useful to tank builders and similar things other than me
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:09:35 ?
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:10:44 The design allows the gun to simulate recoil without the possibility of the projectile from the firework self destructing the gun
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:11:24 That's to show how it connects
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:11:31 And how you get the recoil
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:11:51 You can just change the signs to . With size 1
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:11:58 To make them invisible
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:12:44 Funky how the sparkler only has 3 weld faces
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:13:07 Front bottom and base
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:13:27 Front and bottom refer to uh
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:14:09 Using the front of the arrow as the front of the plot
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:14:35 In isometric view only the front right and bottom faces weld
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:14:41 Which would be
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:15:10 2 of the sides
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:15:16 And the base of the sparkler
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:15:20 Also uh
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 05:15:36 This connecting thing is the same with uh smoke and snow
creations-chat 2022-04-11 06:57:38 <@539537860215439360> a neat idea would be modifying the clamshell bomb bay doors into a rotating door as per the American variant of the Canberra.
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 00:25:04 Mfw I realize during WW2 the US Navy tried to make submarines a component of their carrier fleets of 33-knot destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and carriers.
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 00:59:08 what is what
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 02:48:47 Should I have the pressure hull deck of the conning tower be lower than the light hull deck?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 03:08:01 So in other words as shown in the image I posted?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 03:24:07 No...
general 2022-04-14 14:41:43 So naval AP is actually APCBC-HE-T?
events-chat 2022-04-15 05:32:11 So is there a length limit on submarines?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:48:28 Periscope on top?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:53:13 Like all the stug variants have a periscopic sight
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:57:41 On the left side of the roof, as the gunner is seated directly behind the driver.
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 11:58:31 On some variants there isn't a periscopic sight but there is a cupola for the commander, who is seated behind the gunner
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 12:05:21 You can't see it in this perspective but on early model stug variants like the stug a there is a hole cut out for the gunsight
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 12:05:37 Here you can see the hole
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 12:09:17 If you look up stug iii a you'll cone around images showing the gunsight hole more visibly that aren't just model tanks
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 12:09:51 On later variants it got replaced by a periscope or cupola
events-chat 2022-04-15 13:25:58 Which is?
events-chat 2022-04-15 13:26:53 So no box folding?
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 04:24:26 Should I leave the deck unpainted or paint it in a dark blue color like this?
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 04:28:04 Also if painted should it cover the whole deck or should there be a bordering ring like this?
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 04:32:18 I mean on the actual USS Cod the paint goes all the way over the deck so should I paint it like that?
plane-crazy 2022-04-16 04:43:46 well?

general 2022-04-24 02:22:15 Can someone explain why though?
general 2022-04-24 02:23:12 But they were used in Korea
general 2022-04-24 02:23:44 But they mainly fought jets in the air.
general 2022-04-24 02:24:11 I understand wing mounted gun convergence
general 2022-04-24 02:24:26 But why would you use gun convergence on nose mounted guns?
general 2022-04-24 02:24:35 Aren't nose mounted guns accurate enough?
general 2022-04-24 02:25:12 And wouldn't gun convergence on nose mounted guns just make them completely lose any sense of accuracy after a shorter distance?
general 2022-04-24 02:25:22 Than without convergence?
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 01:12:06 I redid turret interior a little bit.
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 01:20:10 There used to be a hallway between the gunner rooms and control room but it didn't make sense because then there was no room for the rammers.

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:48:36 I ran out of plot space to mount it onto anything other than the barbette itself.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:00 Maybe someone should make a large monitor hull that i can drop the turret onto.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:08 2.5k+ blocks.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:26 It's a heavily motorlocked turret with an interior
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:50:03 This is why the turret is 2.5k blocks.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:52:04 To make an interior like that you need a lot of motorlock.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:54:02 Here's a challenge someone should make a large semi-realistic monitor with space to mount this.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:55:06 That motorlock is specifically for the barbette and the build is literally too large to "just make it taller" because it hits the plot height limit.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:55:55 now have coastal artillery
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:58:09 I'm not going to waste time making the build even more complicated when the exposed motorlock is for a section of the barbette you would literally never see if it were mounted on a ship.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:00:17 Well if you make a large enough ship.

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:04:56 I didn't say 10k blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:05:04 I said a 10k block ship that is very wide
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:05:56 You can't make something 10k blocks wide without it being a single line.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:06:21 You can make a ship that is very wide and totals 10k blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:06:43 Drawing of HMS Terror, the sister ship monitor to HMS Erebus
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:07:09 I think?
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:07:22 Erebus class monitor
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:08:25 They took an extra 15 inch turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:08:45 And made a wide metal floating platform that could mount it
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:09:02 And then gave that floating platform crappy engines that liked to explode
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:10:18 Are you gonna just make the ship with turret or do you wanna make it without the turret and instead mount my turret?
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:14:25 I'm kind of busy rn but what I can say is that the barbette has a diameter of 14 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:15:19 1:1 scale of what a twin 16 inch or 18 inch gun might be.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:15:43 So larger than 15 inch turret would be
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:16:22 I might make a 15 inch turret  on its own.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:17:21 But rn I'm too busy to be making anything ingame
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:19:11 The width at the waterline is is 26 meters.
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:19:26 Which would be roughly 30 blocks wide at the waterline?
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:19:52 And 135 blocks long?

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:22:06 9 block wide turret?
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:23:17 From what I've seen the diameter of main battery barbettes on WW1 battleships are usually 1/3 the beam of the ship?
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:23:43 Stability reasons
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:24:20 Actually not just WW1 battleships
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:24:50 Make it an odd number 27
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:25:24 But also WW2 battleships too the diameter of the barbettes is 1/3 the max beam of the ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 14:25:59 Though on like say the Iowa class the forward turret is mounted much further ahead when the hull starts to narrow down

plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:55:44 should i keep this turret face design?
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:55:59 or use this face design instead?
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:57:11 2nd one has an increased angle on the face plate to 45 degrees instead of 30 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:57:52 and increased elevation by 15 degrees but decreased depression by 7.5 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:58:48 also 2nd design has smaller internal space and reduced gun elevation rate above 25 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:59:43 so which one is better?
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 04:14:22 should i make the top of the blast bags larger like this?
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 04:15:34 but then they stick out when i depress the guns
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 04:48:02 I've already settled on the 2nd design and now I've got this.
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 04:50:10 This is the original turret I made.

general 2022-05-13 04:45:32 hmm...
general 2022-05-13 04:53:27 i just realized hms royal sovereign's guns don't really recoil when they fire, or at least they don't seem to recoil
general 2022-05-13 04:54:28 unlike how disappearing guns have a recoil system which is what appears to be the sort of mount royal sovereign had the barbette guns simply retract at some point after firing when they decide to reload
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 12:59:00 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 13:00:00 I’m gonna make the entire 15 inch mk 1 turret assembly

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 13:00:54 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 02:02:53 Is this fine?
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 02:03:17 Or should I find a better way to conceal the interior?

plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:44:52 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:45:01 should i make the 15 inch guns fire at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:45:08 or should i make them fire independently
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:45:34 like this?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:47:01 that's called a broadside salvo where all the guns fire at once
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 04:47:29 what i'm saying is should the two 15 inch guns for my 15 inch turret fire as a salvo or independent of each other?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 01:44:37 How's this so far?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 03:01:32

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:56:59 Does this look decent so far for a 15 inch gun?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:57:42 In terms of scale and proportions?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 19:33:53 Better 15 inch guns?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 15:36:44 trying to make guns recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:09:40 They aren't but they do recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:09:48 
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:09:57 I'm uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:10:05 Making Vanguard turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:10:44 It's because the breech is like twice the diameter of the barrel.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:36 I gave the guns separate recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:44 No I just use a spring
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:52 That's how I make all my guns recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:12:28 But I use something else like a firework or rocket to fire a projectile out.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:13:14 Well it's kind of hard to fire a projectile out of a solid cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:13:44 What am I gonna do? Make a round heavily over angle-locked pipe?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:14:27 Nah I'm gonna make the gun turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:15:10 Ok but I can complete the turret in less time than that.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:15:38 It's not a recoiless weapon.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:16:09 What I do is hide a firework launcher or rocket in the gun so that when it recoils it shoots a projectile.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:16:55 Like I can make a ro-scale 5 inch deck gun that can recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:17:21 I put it on the USS Cod I made that doesn't yet have an interior
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:17:46 This
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:18:06 The deck gun on the aft can recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:18:51 Hmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:19:42 A miniature aircraft carrier with a 508mm turretless cannon?

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:20:30 On my submarine?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:21:01 Have a flying torpedo boat
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:22:43 Battleship gun breeches are fucking enormous in diameter
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:23:48 While the barrel length of the BL 15-inch Mk I is 16 meters, the breech length is only half a meter, however the breech is also like 3 times the diameter of the bore of the gun.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:24:53 So the breech of a battleship gun, while significantly shorter than say a tank gun's breech in terms of scaling, is significantly thicker.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:25:10 In respect to the caliber of the gun

plane-crazy 2022-09-24 05:45:30 (Very cramped but manageable to get in and out of gunner seat)
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 05:45:36 (For now)
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 16:50:35 For easy service of the engine
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:52:36 I don't know if I've ever posted my completed M22 Locust here?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:52:51 I had tried to make it as close to roscale as possible
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:53:44 I think it did indeed have a gunner and commander position
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:53:54 But was cramped to the power of 5
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:54:57 Either way did not last long as a worthwhile tank just like the real ones
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:55:52 I couldn't figure out a way to make the turret look good without it feeling oversized
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:56:09 It's just too fucking small
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 19:57:09 Consider the following
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 23:13:51 The amount of motorlock required to make this functioning turret with a "turret basket"
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 23:14:31 Aka the gunner seat
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 00:51:58 But roscale is roscale

creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:22:15 I didn't use angle lock on the armor plate and there will be incorrect proportions due to the nature of it trying to cram enough space to fit 4 people inside while the commander can just poke his head out the top, but I can consider other detailing

general 2022-09-25 16:51:48 Because they can't stop it from swinging on the move
general 2022-09-25 16:52:22 The metal yoke shaped thing on tanks that the gun fits inside so the turret doesn't move when the tank is traveling
general 2022-09-25 16:52:59 Prevents tanks from accidentally swinging their barrels into shit and possibly damaging other things or their own gun
general 2022-09-25 16:55:48 While yes tanks do generally have a separate pin inside the turret to lock the traverse and another separate pin inside to lock the elevation that's all they are, two pins
general 2022-09-25 16:56:04 Travel lock is basically redundancy

plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:05:34 Dead weight
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:06:36 If the cockpit was almost entirely gone except for a wireframe and the seat that would actually make it more flyable

creations-chat 2022-10-13 15:15:39 Should I add a large spotlight on this like I did my sherman or should I just leave it at a 50 cal, periscopes, and the radio antennae on the roof?

creations-chat 2022-10-13 19:58:51 At least for me
creations-chat 2022-10-14 05:48:21 I should also probably note that this is what the interior of the turret looks like, the interior of the hull is no different but the turret is slightly less cramped than the Sherman turret

I recommend using a smoke/snow pipe for the sponsons and then modifying the hull very slightly so the pipe only welds to the motor and gun

I recommend using springs that have weld break disabled and autoretract enabled for simple small scale recoiling guns. You can conceal the spring through a variety of ways and use text blocks to connect the free end of the spring to the barrel, and even armor the rocket/firework. There just needs to be internal space for the mechanism
