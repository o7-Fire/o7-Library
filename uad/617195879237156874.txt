creations-chat 2021-04-28 02:59:15 added bonus if you put ladders at the ends so it really ties together that bunk bed look
creations-chat 2021-04-28 03:03:20 i use that bed design on virtually all my builds because its compact, good looking, and really easy to do

creations-chat 2021-06-02 15:28:15 anyone have an idea how i could add more control over the height of the forks

since i use a piston it only goes to the max height or the lowest height, and cant have it in the middle

i need something compact, and suspension with rope wont fit in there

i'll just try it anyways and see how i like it (nvm)
creations-chat 2021-06-02 15:42:01 not possible, not nearly enough space

(which most dont know how to do)
