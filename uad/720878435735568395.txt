creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:16:02 Why are people so harsh with the downvotes in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:18:04 Thats harsh, people try there best and they get shut down with all the downvotes, just like your doing
creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:22:11 Do you see people giving advice, theres some decent builds on there and you and alot of other people keep downvoting because its "trash" i have seen no one give any good advice other than downvoting, be a little less harsh, some people are really sensitive as well, i atleast expect some better criticism other then downvotingðŸ˜•
creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:24:24 And you resort to insults, you saying a build is "trash" doesn't mean you have to downvote
creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:26:28 You are twisting my words, im saying you dont have to downvote, it can make people sad because they prob spent hours making it, this server is fucked im out of here
