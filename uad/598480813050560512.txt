My personal feedback would be an olive color like you see on every 1960s american tank. 
The barrel looks a bit funky, try flipping a few sparklers to where there flat pieces meet, reduces the amount of little plates on the barrel

And also, Not that you can fix this but the graphics make it look a bit funky

Aside from that, I would make the yellow a little more pale and also spread a slightly brighter/darker yellow randomly around it like camo, it'll separate the big yellow with some spots of brighter/yellow. Here's an example but white
creations-chat 2023-06-09 22:38:05 90% of these are trucks with blue led strip lights, and irl white lights would be better overall because they're brighter. Even if there are trucks with blue lights, the blue light still an eyesore

creations-chat 2023-06-24 17:57:02 Go to the subreddit, over there people don't tell you to delete your builds and actually give you critisim/help when you ask for it
creations-chat 2023-06-24 17:59:09 ong, but it's better than asking a wall (this server) for help <:clueless:942802644043464734>

the-dump 2023-07-02 18:53:47 2
the-dump 2023-07-02 18:54:18 could be 2/2 or a 2/10
creations-chat 2023-07-04 18:36:25 <@342662955575410690> I think a muzzle break would look better if istead of ladders, you use circle emojis
creations-chat 2023-07-04 18:51:36 Can't exactly see the emojis from their flat side, also, if possible try to motor lock 1 block back, it makes the barrel look weird with the motor lock clipping through.
Also, try to adjust the suspension to make a little curve in the wheels because it looks a little odd with how flat the wheels/tracks are
creations-chat 2023-07-04 18:54:18 I would make the text size small enough for 2 emojis and where they don't get cut at the top, and also that top piece where the half blocks are, I would make it out of disconnectors and cameras
creations-chat 2023-07-04 18:56:28 Unless there's something above the disconnectors (where the pillar is facing), they should always disconnect. I'll post an image to show you what I'm talking abt
help 2023-07-04 19:04:32 Does anyone have a color that matches this perfectly? I'm tryna get a camo
help 2023-07-04 19:32:45 ty
help 2023-07-04 21:26:44 I would add some more details
help 2023-07-04 21:27:47 Adding trail blocks around to make it look like cables or ropes holding things up, split up the plain grey by making some of the grey slightly darker or brighter
help 2023-07-04 21:30:23 what mountain camo
help 2023-07-04 21:31:15 If you want it in <#384025409945337856> you're gonna have to make sacrifices. Personally, I would just do the coloring thing (splitting the grey)
help 2023-07-04 21:31:51 Here's an example
help 2023-07-04 21:32:02 It makes it look a lot better
help 2023-07-04 21:33:26 Do you want it to be exactly like in the image or just like those in general
help 2023-07-04 21:34:14 I have some colors but they might not be too accurate because I don't feel like going ingame to check what they look like, but I generally know what they look like
help 2023-07-04 21:34:49 the darker grey 50 50 50
The grey 90 90 90
The bright grey 120 120 120
help 2023-07-04 21:35:12 if you keep all 3 numbers the same in the coloring section it'll be a shade of white/black
help 2023-07-04 21:35:21 The higher the numbers are the brighter it will be
help 2023-07-04 21:35:28 The lower the numbers the darker it will be
help 2023-07-04 21:35:44 Yeah no problem
creations-chat 2023-07-04 21:38:54 Pcc members resisting the urge to tell noobs to delete their builds
creations-chat 2023-07-04 21:45:03 What is it supposed to be? Whatever it is it looks pretty cool so far
creations-chat 2023-07-04 21:47:09 <@563012956447571968> I would make the green and the brown on your jet much much more pale, What you have right now makes it look like a pretty puke-look-a-like camo
creations-chat 2023-07-04 21:50:58 A core? Like a nuclear reactor core?
creations-chat 2023-07-04 21:53:08 You just gotta paste multiple images in one text, ie: upload 1 image, then another, then another, then upload it and it'll all pop in the same message
creations-chat 2023-07-05 10:53:53 I remember seeing that in pvp mode
And I also remember what you did in pvp mode.

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 07:10:50 I'm trying to make an airship that looks like this, but I don't want it to just be an airship with turrets, so I'm looking for some ideas, like cosmetic features or features in general, like maybe a magnet arm that picks up cargo
help 2023-07-06 07:16:11 I'm trying to make an airship that looks like this, but I don't want it to just be an airship with turrets, so I'm looking for some ideas, like cosmetic features or features in general, like a robotic magnetic arm that loads cargo onto itself
help 2023-07-06 07:57:15 I plan on mixing a steampunk and modern theme to it. Think like as if it were found in modern day and just given upgrades
help 2023-07-06 07:58:55 I've never made one before, sounds like a great idea ngl

help 2023-07-10 06:01:08 Black, grey and red
help 2023-07-10 12:53:46 You need to counteract the main rotor's torque with a tail rotor, like a real life helicopter
help 2023-07-10 12:54:33 What's a tipjet
help 2023-07-10 12:55:16 Oh
help 2023-07-10 12:56:09 Well, either way, the blades still produce torque (or another force, dunno), so I think you'd still need a tail rotor if you're actually making the spinning blades produce lift
help 2023-07-10 12:56:33 My huey actively uses a tailrotor
help 2023-07-10 12:57:01 Balance completely fucks it up when hovering though but moving works great
help 2023-07-10 13:05:53 Cause they're just really complex machines
help 2023-07-10 13:06:08 They can be extremely simplified if you used a double rotor (forgot the name)
help 2023-07-10 13:06:25 Coax rotors yeah
help 2023-07-10 13:06:33 Don't add a tail rotor to them
help 2023-07-10 13:06:39 it makes them look hella ugly and nooby
help 2023-07-10 13:06:48 But they can look great
help 2023-07-10 13:08:25 Not to pat myself on the back but my attack helicopter is a great example
help 2023-07-10 13:09:11 Add your propulsion (hover engines, rockets, propellers, etc) to the very top
help 2023-07-10 13:09:28 Typically what I do is I just motorlock the rotor and stack engines on the motor lock tower
help 2023-07-10 13:09:48 It's about average sized ngl
