general 2020-04-08 05:59:11 Without being banned for life?
general 2020-04-08 06:00:12 No, like a developer, or moderator, who can I dm?
general 2020-04-08 06:01:22 Ok, so are there requirements to talk to someone a higher level then you? jeez what is these rules, what requirements do i fulfil to do so?
general 2020-04-08 06:01:59 ok.

general 2020-04-08 06:08:51 Yes
general 2020-04-08 06:09:19 And that, is why you always ask the highest person possible on the server.
general 2020-04-08 06:09:31 Well, there is a certain level of trust...
general 2020-04-08 06:10:00 ?

general 2020-04-23 05:29:53 Rickje allowing us to mute is a silly idea, we can do it manually anyway!
general 2020-04-29 00:46:26 I created a 4 axis robotic arm
general 2020-04-29 00:47:15 What, my English is perfect
general 2020-04-29 00:47:40 Same
general 2020-04-29 00:47:49 It pisses me off to be quite frank
general 2020-04-29 00:48:08 I‚Äôve got an idea, we could sign a petition
general 2020-04-29 00:48:59 Ok then
general 2020-04-29 00:49:29 Who should I ping to begin it?
general 2020-04-29 00:49:57 Oof we should ping Rickje
general 2020-04-29 00:51:01 Statement: petition states that once this is accepted, object ‚Äúfloating island‚Äù will be added into the game. Tick to accept

general 2020-04-29 00:51:31 Hmm
general 2020-04-29 00:51:44 How to add reactions on mobile?
general 2020-04-29 00:51:53 Lol I no England rn
general 2020-04-29 00:53:04 Yeah, how do I make a vote?
general 2020-04-29 00:53:13 What‚Äôs the bot command
general 2020-04-29 00:53:41 *then a plane*
general 2020-04-29 00:53:51 Lol
general 2020-04-29 00:54:01 Fair enough
general 2020-04-29 00:54:30 Me?
general 2020-04-29 00:55:35 Map bigger, no extra blocks yet, fix lag on conveyers. A new 2 axis gimbal block would be cool, but would take the fun out of making it yourself
general 2020-04-29 00:56:09 You are not speaking correctly sir
general 2020-04-29 00:57:51 Mil base no, it would inspire all the littleler kids to play army on the server. Not fun. A test grid, like for robots would be cool though
general 2020-04-29 00:58:37 Oh yeah I would also like them to fix the glitch with motors not turning with larger water engines on them
general 2020-04-29 01:02:15 <@!468207489524039680> sorry for pinging you rudely like this, but a couple of people (including myself) have been asking how to use the suggestion bot... how do we use it.

Kind regards

bot-central 2020-04-29 01:04:40 Ok ok
bot-central 2020-04-29 01:06:04 &suggest A map update would be cool. For example adding the floating island back but higher up would be brilliant. Perhaps the  glitch of motors not working with motor props attached would be a good bug to fix too

creations-chat 2020-04-29 08:56:41 MECHANICAL CLAW. 4-axis. No it doesn't look damn good, but it WORKS and can be used to manipulate blocks up to 7X7 beams or even as small as a single block. This mechanical claw is stationary however and is not capeable of movement. The claw can even remotely drop things off the side of the plot!
