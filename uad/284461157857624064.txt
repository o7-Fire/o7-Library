help 2020-04-16 23:25:54 I have a fighter with 9 rocket engines, 1 super rocket engine, and ~10 jet engines. The speed registers at like 250, yet flies horrifically slow. Anyone have an idea of what it is?

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 03:13:45 Why don't turbines and rockets actually activate until they're near or at full power?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 03:15:47 But aren't they releasing energy by being on?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 03:16:58 Then why don't they release any kinetic energy?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 03:17:33 I put mine at 75% and nothing
