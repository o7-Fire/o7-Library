creations-chat 2020-06-11 12:50:23 ~~Figuring it out by myself, which was a pain~~
creations-chat 2020-06-11 12:56:38 Okay 15x15 is too large
creations-chat 2020-06-11 12:56:51 Should i make it 4 barreled?

creations-chat 2020-06-11 13:44:15 No need to post that 3 times because its nothing special
creations-chat 2020-06-11 13:44:23 Alot of people probably have done it already
creations-chat 2020-06-12 02:59:40 Is this good?
creations-chat 2020-06-12 03:05:34 Would be nice if they add invisible motors
creations-chat 2020-06-12 03:06:01 That way i can remove that stupid little tower that is ruining the looks
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:28:41 <@!459749464434016266> The power of wedges2 will help you fix your ship
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:29:29 You wont be able to get alot of upvotes if you just place wedges and blocks everywhere
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:29:55 You have to carefully build it ~~Like me spending half a day just to build one turret~~
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:30:26 ~~And in the end i changed up my mind, and took another day to build a bigger turret~~
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:12:52 chonk
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:17:01 <@456226577798135808> Your battleship has no turrets
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:17:23 Its more of a destroyer
bot-central 2020-06-12 09:57:55 !help
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:26:37 <@!584019963556134913> I suggest making small carriers before making big ones
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:26:50 Because it just looks like a weird floating box
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:27:12 You gonna make smooth bows
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:29:15 I actually could'nt recognize your build until i looked at the description
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:14 It does make it cooler
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:20 But ye, it doesnt need it
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:56 Also is that a youtube tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:31:17 I dont like youtube tutorial builds
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:42:18 I like flexing with my carrier
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:42:34 I am going to flex harder when my battleship is finished
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:10 <@!516385356006817792> The problem is that you just copied the youtube tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:26 Theres no point of showing off your creation if someone already build it
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:30 Are you sure?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:40 It looks like its from the tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:53:41 <@!409676438682206218> Its on youtube, i forgot which youtuber though
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:55:52 Because i saw that exact jet in youtube
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:24 It is
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:28 Look harder
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:52 I always see that tutorial jet in public servers
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:58:56 How could we know if you didnt copy it?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:59:05 Its looks exactly the same
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:02:13 Hmm the back looks different
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:19:06 <@456226577798135808> I didnt like how you didnt use wedges2 in the b2 stealth bomber, but i will upvote because it looks awesome
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:20:27 Oh no
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:20:33 More tutorials builds pls no
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:20:55 Oh no
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:20:56 Okay
creations-chat 2020-06-13 13:06:22 <@584019963556134913>  Holy oof, your creation has 63 downvotes lol
creations-chat 2020-06-13 13:16:10 What is even happening? Lol
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:40:44 ~~Pls use wedges2~~
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:41:14 You're an expert at everything ~~Why arent you using wedges2~~
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:48:47 <@456226577798135808> I have seen you post that like 4 times now
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:48:49 Stopppp
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:56:57 Ill rate it 1/10 because you posted it again and again
creations-chat 2020-06-15 13:50:05 Tbh the system should stay, so you can post pictures in this channel without it being posted in <#384025409945337856> .You can let people see your creation being constructed, you can post the picture where your build was based off, or you can show a picture what your build does...
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:09:52 USS Montana vs Yamato, who do you think would win?
(For people who doesnt know Montana, its a US battleship that was planned to be the successor of Iowa, but the construction was cancelled.)
creations-chat 2020-06-19 04:15:48 Nice
creations-chat 2020-06-19 04:16:36 Hmm i wonder whats up with people building ww2 carriers instead of modern carriers

creations-chat 2020-06-20 00:26:26 I am not really expecting that my battleship will get into hof

creations-chat 2020-06-20 00:44:30 I get like 7-10 fps when my battleship is launched
creations-chat 2020-06-20 00:46:41 And thats why i wanna build working tank tracks
creations-chat 2020-06-20 00:46:54 ~~It doesnt look realistic without them~~
general 2020-06-27 12:27:53 His going so fast that the game cant read his speed anymore

general 2020-06-28 03:18:53 <@!551573378662662145> I am probably the one whos casuing the most lag spike
general 2020-06-28 03:18:58 Causing*

general 2020-06-28 03:20:00 Also i have a big problem with building bridge, so i have to start the whole bridge again
general 2020-06-28 03:21:32 My turrets also work, and it uses alot of piston so = More lag
general 2020-06-28 03:26:04 Someone came up to my battleship and said that to me too
general 2020-06-28 03:26:13 I am like ~~Bruh~~
general 2020-06-28 03:26:39 Well obviously no one can steal my build atleast
general 2020-06-28 03:26:46 Too complex for the minds of public players
general 2020-06-28 03:28:31 Me?

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 05:18:27 
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:39:55 <@!467765396108476426> Cool ship but i suggest not painting your creation while its not finished
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:40:02 Or else it will take a long time to finish
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:40:22 Look at my battleship... I built it within 4-5 days
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:40:36 And its 8k blocks with complex systems

creations-chat 2020-06-28 08:52:14 Do you guys think that there should be another creations channel for builds that made it up to 20+ or more upvotes?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 08:52:57 I think good builds deserve more
creations-chat 2020-06-28 08:53:27 I also think that time is the only thing thats blocking good builds in reaching HoF or something else
creations-chat 2020-06-28 11:22:52 That thing is insane
creations-chat 2020-06-28 11:22:59 The insane pc setup

creations-chat 2020-06-30 12:45:20 I have an unfinished battleship, if you wanna take a look at it

creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:39:38 Wdym
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:39:54 The wedges
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:40:10 You didnt use wedges2 to make everything cooler didnt you?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:40:21 wedges2 is the most op blocks in this game
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:41:45 For me, the reason is that theres no wedges2
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:43:05 Why not use traingle wedges2,3,4,etc.
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:43:13 it made my ship alot smoother
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:44:18 <@!430394898726780940> Thats why i said use wedges2
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:44:25 It looks like a box instead
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:45:11 lemme just make a small nose of a zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:46:14 I meant like using traingles wedges2,3,4,etc.

plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:07:57 Its fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:08:16 Are you sure, its lagging the WHOLE server?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:08:25 Maybe its just you
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:08:39 How can you tell?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:08:53 And?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:09:15 Are you sure its not an FPS drop
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:09:40 Usually big builds doesnt lag the server that much
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:09:46 If theres only one of course
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:09:51 So your FPS is at 3
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:09:59 That means your the only one who is lagging
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:10:17 Have you asked them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:10:32 And did you check your ping?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:11:07 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:11:10 Seems fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:12:27 How much blocks does he have on his build?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:13:17 Usually that only affects fps

general 2020-08-06 14:26:04 <@339519624968404993> What does outlines have to do with roblox physics? Isnt just a visual thing?

plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:25:59 I am planning to change the hull once its finished
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:26:50 Hmm i use pistons
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:27:02 To lift stuff up
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:27:18 Are those magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:27:30 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:27:47 Thats actually a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:29:01 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:30:10 For now my ship is like a prototype...
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:30:18 I might start from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:30:50 Trying to make folding that is seamless..
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:30:59 No random flying motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 10:33:13 Did you try using pistons to lift stuff up?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 02:13:32 It was a rushed build btw, decided to move on to another project
creations-chat 2020-08-08 02:13:48 I wanted to change everything like the hull...
creations-chat 2020-08-08 02:14:05 But it will be harder so... I am gonna start again from scratch

creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:57:21 I really miss the outlines
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:58:02 Removing the outlines made building large stuff 10000% harder
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:58:54 Hmm thats a good suggestion
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:59:02 Or a option to enable outlines in settings
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:59:19 Or an option to enable outlines in settings...

creations-chat 2020-08-08 11:01:25 I dont think they really need to bring back outlines... I think they just need to fix the lightning
creations-chat 2020-08-08 11:01:40 So we could see better
