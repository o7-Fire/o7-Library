general 2023-07-02 19:27:58 I wonder if the beloved plane crazy plane on load screen will be in pc2
general 2023-07-02 19:28:21 Daaawwwwww
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:30:35 Ik why
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:31:03 It is because you don't have a counterforce against the inertia of the heli going in the other direction
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:31:12 Try making a spinning back like this
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:31:51 Also
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:31:52 Have a bunch of wing panels facing straight
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:32:57 /tail rotor is needed
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:32:58 <@777954191699869737> show me ur heli
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:33:17 Also try not to use propellor blade
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:33:26 Instead use a motor set to lock and 0.2 speed
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:33:45 Connect normal wing panels to that
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:33:47 And add super thrusters like me
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:33:54 another solution is
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:03 Adding double non powered motors
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:20 Both motor tips are non powered kind of like a motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:40 This causes there to only be an upward force and no spin
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:48 Kind of like a rope
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:52 
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:34:59 It cant be pulled as easily as it can be spinned
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:36:12 Got it?
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:36:32 Simply( use non powered motors to connect the rotor)
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:37:13 SS it
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:37:35 Hm
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 19:37:43 What do u play on
