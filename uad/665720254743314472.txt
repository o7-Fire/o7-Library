general 2020-03-24 07:48:48 Ohh nice
creations-chat 2020-03-24 07:49:35 Look at all these beautiful creations! Wait there is none because all I see is people arguing in a chat made for people creations.
creations-chat 2020-03-24 07:49:57 Oh this is the chat
creations-chat 2020-03-24 07:49:59 I‚Äôm new here
creations-chat 2020-03-24 07:50:05 My bad bro
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:27:44 I can infact agree.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:28:30 I don‚Äôt see why people act like people on mobile are less capable of building things than people on pc.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:29:36 Same
creations-chat 2020-08-07 03:32:54 Fastest response times to what?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:20:35 BOYS
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:20:42 I just got a lot of goodies
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:21:21 My man here called my Sabre trash and then goes onto say that this is his best build
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:21:33 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:21:45 The Sabre is mine the a-10 is his
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:21:52 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:22:26 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:22:39 Oh you didn‚Äôt want to see his tanks
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:22:46 I didn‚Äôt screenshot them though
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:23:02 He did have wheels on one of them
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:23:16 The others were just straight up blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:24:30 Sorry about the discord notification but this was his best build and the a-10 was his next best
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:25:10 Cylinders with guns on them
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:25:51 He then went on to say about my build ‚ÄúThis is from war thunder‚Äù ‚Äúis this a tutorial?‚Äù
creations-chat 2020-11-29 00:10:16 Maybe
creations-chat 2020-11-29 01:53:10 <@456226577798135808> now that the nose is fixed may I see it?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 06:58:33 <@!720891502108344360> that is quite the a320! üëç
help 2020-11-29 18:35:47 My aircraft was very tail heavy so I used a few ballast blocks to even it out. It takes off fine now but then it will not be able to gain altitude and if I let go of the control surfaces it will slowly decend. Would this be caused by a lack of control surfaces or wing panels?
help 2020-11-29 18:38:10 I‚Äôm on mobile so my pitch keybinds are simply my joystick
help 2020-11-29 18:40:56 When motor locking wing panels into the nose is it possible to hide the motors afterwards?
creations-chat 2020-12-05 22:44:51 <@314383347214319616> is that a T1 Trust?
creations-chat 2021-03-24 15:39:22 <@!402617794606399488> Based off of the Coulson Aviation Chinook scheme?
help 2021-05-16 01:05:08 Anyone know how I could get this bathtub flying? I‚Äôve tried ballast blocks, control surfaces and rocket engine placement.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 01:08:03 The experimental XF-85 Goblin. This aircraft was to be able to be deployed and retrieved into the fuselage of the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 Peacemaker. Thoughts on how it looks? It wasn‚Äôt a very appealing plane in real time.

creations-chat 2021-05-16 01:14:08 egg look good? Egg look bad? **egg**
creations-chat 2021-05-16 02:40:03 I would make a bomber to launch it but that would require two separate builds. I will have to try and find someone that can create a compatible hook mechanism
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:16:51 I will probably try a hovering platform with a hook mechanism just to see how it works on a flying object.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:08:40 Very **hot**
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:11:00 Eh. I can agree but ever so slightly. Still looks good in my opinion.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:13:02 Not really. The wings just come straight out of the fuselage. You should create a triangular transition.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:18:54 I am happy to say that after many test flights, propulsion revamps, control surface revamps, and the insertion of a ridiculous number of wing panels that the **egg** can finally maintain stable flight.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:22:20 I did incorporate suggestions and still am. That‚Äôs the original picture. The cockpit is now changed and has been.
