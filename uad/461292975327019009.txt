help 2021-03-26 23:07:24 This is my first copter with that advanced rotor system
help 2021-03-26 23:07:26 rather than rigid
help 2021-03-26 23:10:59 Yea, I, however if I dont force the yaw to the right when its flying at max speed it shifts left, but other than that its stable. Cant hover though idk how people get it to just hover
