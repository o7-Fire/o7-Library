[Title] - Floating Islands
[Catagory] - Gameplay
[Description] - A large array of floating islands that have holes and gaps in/inbetween them, sort of like the ones in War Thunder's April Fool's 2021 event or the movie Avatar.

general 2022-03-16 23:22:01 At this point they dont have to care
general 2022-03-16 23:22:17 Since the vast majority of the playerbase is braindead 9 year olds
general 2022-03-16 23:23:21 The problem is that the devs that are in charge of the 9 year old games are unaffected by the change (mostly)
general 2022-03-16 23:24:29 Im pretty sure it wont be a big deal for the largest game devs to get approval for new sounds
general 2022-03-16 23:24:41 Considering some games have like 200k concurent players

I didn't realize you were in this server
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:12:50 Some of these ratioes are insane bruh
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:32:18 Oh wait wait wait

When was the last time you looked at this server?
In 2022 it was picky
Nowadays even mid builds get good ratioes
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:35:07 Guh
Even the glass trend from a while back (paint bucket glass and post) trend was more creative
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:37:14 Mfw I slap a shitty turret onto a recent hull and get a 35:1 ratio:
*Edit I did my math wrong lmao
It's actually 52:1 when getting rid of the hyperbot default upvote/downvote
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:47:20 I just went back and grabbed a random one
(This isnt mine)
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:32:32 Barrel is excessively long but other that that it's fine

Barrel length should be roughly 2.5 times the turret length (take the length of the turret, multiply it by 2.5, and that's how long the barrel should be)
