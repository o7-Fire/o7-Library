The Tale of brght_lght (745453888492142662)
general 2023-02-21 00:50:02 YES FINALLY I VERIFIED
general 2023-02-21 00:50:23 the verification system is pretty bad roblox keeps tagging
general 2023-02-21 00:54:46 when is the winter update
general 2023-02-21 00:55:02 :(
general 2023-02-21 00:55:07 i just want the snow map
general 2023-02-21 00:55:18 i never got the fireworks
general 2023-02-21 00:55:59 maybe rickje is manually rebuilding everyone's creations in plane crazy 2
general 2023-02-21 18:16:37 no they arent
general 2023-02-21 18:17:01 the only thing they are good for are those spammy tanks made by noobs which is just a rectangle with wheels and a crap ton of rockets
general 2023-02-21 18:17:06 shredders suck
general 2023-02-21 18:18:13 why would you want a shredder for air to ground just make a bomber
general 2023-02-21 18:18:17 its so much more fun
general 2023-02-21 18:18:23 or make your own ground vehicle
general 2023-02-21 18:18:51 💀
general 2023-02-21 18:19:06 bro just drank all of them
general 2023-02-21 18:19:21 im sure mad vulpen has one
general 2023-02-21 18:19:39 maybe hes new
general 2023-02-21 18:19:43 new people use tutorials
general 2023-02-21 18:19:49 so lets give him one so he can learn
general 2023-02-21 18:19:55 well now they do ig
general 2023-02-21 18:20:03 oh
general 2023-02-21 18:20:14 idk just experiment with crap
general 2023-02-21 18:20:30 dont watch tutorials look at guides, to help you learn how to build one
general 2023-02-21 18:20:43 like fireyoblivion
general 2023-02-21 18:20:49 he has some very good guides
general 2023-02-21 18:21:07 just get better
general 2023-02-21 18:21:19 !!
general 2023-02-21 18:21:44 does it count as a lag machine if my build is gigantic and it sucks at folding
general 2023-02-21 18:22:30 :(
general 2023-02-21 18:22:31 yeah
general 2023-02-21 18:23:19 if you can make a sentence you can make something fly or float in plane crazy
general 2023-02-21 18:23:22 dont make helis
general 2023-02-21 18:23:31 helicopters are hard to build
general 2023-02-21 18:23:37 the one thing i cant comprehend
general 2023-02-21 18:24:01 i have made very good submarines, jets, large planes, boats, cars, but for the life of me i cannot make a helicopter fly well
general 2023-02-21 18:24:38 they arent very good but sure, most are small
general 2023-02-21 18:24:43 very good in flying
general 2023-02-21 18:24:49 like theyre easy to fly
general 2023-02-21 18:24:53 they look pretty crappy
general 2023-02-21 18:24:56 but they fly well
general 2023-02-21 18:25:12 its hard to make a heli fly well thats what i was saying
general 2023-02-21 18:25:29 it leaked fuel when it wasnt moving
general 2023-02-21 18:25:49 when it was move the titanium tightened and sealed the gaps that leaked fuel
general 2023-02-21 18:25:54 yeah
general 2023-02-21 18:26:21 they would blacklist you
general 2023-02-21 18:27:09 why couldnt they use the plane crazy ice material, its very lightweight and has a high melting point
general 2023-02-21 18:27:26 i read about that
general 2023-02-21 18:28:02 it does
general 2023-02-21 18:28:06 its shiny though
general 2023-02-21 18:28:24 if youre interested in the blackbird you should look into operation sand dollar
general 2023-02-21 18:28:28 also pretty cool
general 2023-02-21 18:29:05 wrong reply
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 18:04:50 r
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 18:05:03 how to get image perms
general 2023-02-26 18:15:28 how to get image perms
general 2023-02-26 18:16:19 brick seperator doesnt do crap
general 2023-02-26 18:16:39 yummy snack while building
general 2023-02-26 18:16:46 how to get image permissions
general 2023-02-26 18:17:11 but you have image perms
general 2023-02-26 18:18:41 i checked that its rickje telling people that ask for mod no
bot-central 2023-02-26 18:19:51 !rank
general 2023-02-26 18:20:10 oh
general 2023-02-26 18:20:18 ok well i need to be level 3
general 2023-02-26 18:25:50 how do i apply for architect role
general 2023-02-26 18:28:26 can i see the helicopter you built
general 2023-02-26 18:28:31 for the heli technician role
general 2023-02-26 18:29:38 add ballast blocks and some super rockets to it and now you have a submersible gun
general 2023-02-26 18:30:02 does it just shoot rockets or does it shoot tnt
general 2023-02-26 18:30:24 in game
general 2023-02-26 18:30:45 yeah but the gustav shoots gigantic projectiles
general 2023-02-26 18:30:54 so a rocket or a tnt
general 2023-02-26 18:31:00 oh
general 2023-02-26 18:31:08 haha balls
general 2023-02-26 18:31:12 balls go boom
general 2023-02-26 18:32:05 what is the fastest speed that someone has gone in plane crazy
general 2023-02-26 18:32:34 can you do that for a long period of time?
general 2023-02-26 18:32:38 or is it just a glitch
general 2023-02-26 18:33:09 im new so idk
general 2023-02-26 18:53:29 thats nitrous right?
general 2023-02-26 18:54:46 oh
general 2023-02-26 18:55:12 used in nuclear reactors and rocket fuel, number one cause of drowning, anyone who consumes it dies
general 2023-02-26 18:55:18 must be banned
general 2023-02-26 18:55:24 dangerous chemical
general 2023-02-26 18:55:41 HAHAHA
general 2023-02-26 18:55:49 water
general 2023-02-26 18:56:13 i wasnt correcting you i was asking
general 2023-02-26 18:56:34 tank master 48
general 2023-02-26 18:57:15 ammonia+bleach=wonderful air freshner
general 2023-02-26 18:58:32 can a hover engine work under water? my sub goes too slow underwater, above ground it goes 500 below water it goes 29
general 2023-02-26 18:58:52 will it glitch out or something
general 2023-02-26 18:59:08 ok thanks
general 2023-02-26 19:00:06 who wants classified military documents of the su 27 ( so you can make your plane crazy creations extra accurate)
general 2023-02-26 19:00:30 so is that a yes?
general 2023-02-26 19:00:53 is that my ip?
general 2023-02-26 19:00:56 let me check
general 2023-02-26 19:03:04 e
general 2023-02-26 19:03:21 im not a high enough rank to post my classiffied documents here
general 2023-02-26 19:03:51 <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-02-27 01:36:01 whats the glitch where you can see the ocean floor by looking through a glass block
general 2023-02-27 01:36:17 is that it? you just go first person mode in a plane with a glass cockpit
general 2023-02-27 01:36:28 idk what to call it, bcs ur supposed to see the water
general 2023-02-27 01:36:40 but u see the ocean floor so how do u do that
general 2023-02-27 01:37:14 so is it legacy glass or normal glass
general 2023-02-27 01:37:28 like glass material
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:19:42 whats the fastest you can stably fly in plane crazy in a plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:20:15 40k is the fastest i have hit in a moc plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:20:20 mine is also wasd
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:20:30 kinda?
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:20:39 it looks pretty bad i'll send a picture
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:21:43 i dont think you can classify it as a plane though
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:30:55 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 03:30:58 foil
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 04:05:26 Bad angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 04:05:52 It looks like an intricate camo pattern from a distanc
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 16:02:52 same tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 04:50:58 build a boat probably
general 2023-03-25 04:51:45 im trying to make a cinema drone that need to move left right and forward very stably, what is the lowest powered engine i can use
general 2023-03-25 04:51:48 not water jet
general 2023-03-25 04:54:34 really?
general 2023-03-25 04:54:36 that works?
general 2023-03-25 04:55:30 what conveyor drive though, the one with a locked motor, or the one with fabric cylinders and springs
general 2023-03-25 04:56:04 yeah im pretty sure i've seen something like that idk
general 2023-03-25 04:56:10 ok so its the other one
general 2023-03-25 04:56:12 ok got it
general 2023-03-25 05:03:59 oh
general 2023-03-25 05:04:04 i did the spring one and it works really well
general 2023-03-25 05:04:12 thank you for all of it though
general 2023-03-25 05:07:13 i wouldnt say really well but pretty good
general 2023-03-25 05:07:21 good enough for my purposes
general 2023-03-25 05:08:57 oh
general 2023-03-25 05:09:09 idk it works well ig but i cant set the conveyor speed below 1
general 2023-03-25 05:13:07 thank you very much for ur help
general 2023-03-25 05:13:51 thats pretty cool, i made a steampunk airship once that was like 1500 blocks but i saved over it
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:48:00 im trying to make the darkstar from top gun maverick and i cant think of a way to make the ridge that's in the center of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:48:09 like it runs all the way to the back
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:48:14 nbm
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:48:14 oh wait no i see a way
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:48:16 *nvm
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:51:15 yeah the spine
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:51:38 i didnt see that there was a flat bottom peice with a weird rhombus on top of it
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:51:44 i know how to build it like that
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:52:21 how do you know?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:52:26 some have a backbone
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:53:32 yeah but there might be a beam on the top of the frame of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:53:37 that counts as a backbone imo
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:57:27 so many control surfaces that it sucks at flying
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:57:47 if u build something really big and slow, it can do that too
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:00:24 it allows you to u turn quicker in my experience, and it also helps get someone off your tail
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:01:12 thats a kvochur bell
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:01:15 cobra flatspin
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:01:45 just get good at pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:01:59 then u can chase them
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:02:51 oh yeah i forgot those spam tanks
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:03:04 yeah bcs theyre annoying
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:03:09 and people build spam tanks
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:03:29 *plan c weaponry
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:04:52 guided missiles ruined pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:05:12 guided missiles brought in shredders and then everyone started building hyper maneuverable tryhard jets
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:06:52 if u use wasd, i use e to pitch the nose up, so add a super rocket that activates when you put e to get much smaller turning radius

plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:12:32 HOW TF DID YOU DID THAT ON A PHONE
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:14:47 cool leopard!!
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:15:22 i have a question, how do i delay motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:15:31 looks like a mig 15
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:15:37 how do i use springs?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:15:48 no i just never needed to delay motorlock before
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:16:01 ty
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:16:10 im trying to avoid tnt
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:16:27 i think i have space
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:16:31 i'll do disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:17:08 can u show me how to do disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:17:11 like with a picture
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:18:00 oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:18:03 ok i can do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:18:04 ty
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:19:37 motorlock isnt motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:20:01 thats a good point actually
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:21:17 i need the half wedge beam to lock into the triangle wedges but it keeps pushing off of it
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:21:41 fine i'll double check
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:22:38 ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:22:54 one of them is powered to tilt the half wedge beam inwards
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:23:21 bradley more like badly 😂(im unfunny i know)
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:29:40 those arent missiles those are lifeboats
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:30:02 no the thing theyre attached too
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:30:06 whats it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:33:44 theyre lifeboats bro
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:33:48 theyre lifeboat sized
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:34:27 thats a good excuse, ima use that the next time one of my builds is shitty
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:34:53 btw thats not supposed to be a dig at you thats a dig at me bcs i suck at building
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:36:50 thats a blackbird?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:07 💀💀💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:13 canards????
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:19 really?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:41 atleast remove the canards
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:43:11 💀💀one vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:43:24 not even one on each engine
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:46:36 then why make it int he first place
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:47:01 but...... wouldnt u have known it was useless before u started making it?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:47:08 unless u made it terrible
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:48:58 shower
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:49:15 oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:49:23 you should build a
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:49:35 ||clicked on this for nothing||
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:50:53 is there any way to glitch through a blacklist red cube
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:51:13 make an ornithopter
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:51:30 huh
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:51:46 are u saying "no shit, bozo" or "no, shit bozo"
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:53:16 im sorry for not going out of my way to harass people who dont want to be harrased
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:53:22 i asked for one of them
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 00:31:51 best way to cover exposed motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 00:32:21 plane crazy players using trigonometry and military grade algorithms to bomb a box car
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 00:32:36 plane crazy players leaking classified documents so their builds are accurate
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 00:32:38 both jokes
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 00:40:45 copyright
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 05:40:38 whats a good way to hide this exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 05:41:03 click the first image to see it spawned in
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 05:41:07 it doesnt show fully here
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:37:01 The radar should weigh a lot though and it should take up like 3x3 blocks of space
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:37:31 Also you can add stealth with special blocks at the cost of speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:57:33 has to be balanced
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:57:39 and it should be in ur plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:57:43 u cant have it on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:57:54 1x1 is op though
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 22:58:12 it needs a drawback so the tryhard jets cant become invincible
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:26:40 its pretty decent but the landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:26:50 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:28:16 1x1 is op
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:28:23 you can slap that on anything
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:28:42 thats the idea, radar is only for the larger planes
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:28:49 not the hypermaneuverable tryhard jets
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:04 not a cyl though just a box
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:15 ah i see, so less range and precision
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:17 for a smaller size?
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:21 thats a good idea
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:40 but then missiles should not have infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:29:52 lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:30:03 *snobbish chuckling*
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:50:43 ok yeah but is plane crazy realistic?
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:50:47 do hover engines exist?
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 23:50:55 non physics wise
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 00:54:52 1x3 ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 00:55:43 auto tracking ig, like it only works in a 300 block radius maybe and it follows whatever u want it to follow and u can continue flying
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 00:58:06 300 is way too small considering the speed some dogfights occur at ig
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 00:58:11 maybe 600 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 00:58:31 and to avoid conveyor drive missiles, u can only use tracking on a special missile with a set speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 02:53:44 not the engine, the thruster itself
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 02:54:02 the mechanics arent realistic, theyre meant to balanace the game, like the pvp, infinite ammo
plane-crazy 2023-03-30 05:08:36 i actually had fun in plane crazy pvp for once and it wasnt shredder balls, box cars, and tryhard jets
plane-crazy 2023-03-30 05:09:04 it was me an another guy with aircraft carriers fighting against ww2 bombers and other bombers
plane-crazy 2023-03-30 05:09:23 it was laggy as hell though
plane-crazy 2023-03-30 05:11:32 actual fair boat pvp 🤯
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:03:36 im pretty sure thats gooing to get u banned
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:03:48 bcs its pretty obvious what ur intention is
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:04:19 idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:04:41 also if i wanted to mount a very heavy bomb onto a plane, is the best place to mount it at the center of mass?(yellow sphere)
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:05:29 yeah it does if i put it at the back i have to keep pitching the nose down and have a hard time getting off the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:05:34 at the front same thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:09:58 well yeah but where would cause the least issues
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:10:01 im assuming middle
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:20:58 yep angle lock with wings and delta wings
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:21:14 maybe to save urself sanity and not to mess with ur boat, you can try it with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:21:18 its much easier
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 03:21:28 build it normally, rotate, and lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:21:37 for dogfighting?
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:21:45 aw no april fools
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:49:39 does newtons 3rd law apply in plane crazy? can 2 magnets pushing of of each other propel something forward?
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:49:51 aw

plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:50:53 wait nvm i found a good one
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:51:42 ikr
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:51:47 does build a boat have one?
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:52:06 maybe like you build half the plane, select it, and copy and mirror it
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:52:51 does angling the wings down improve handling in any way?
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 16:55:29 has anyone made a bob semple tank in game
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 02:04:59 does anyone have a conveyor drive that can fit in a 2x4 space
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 02:05:03 1 block tall
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 16:50:28 bruh i was just telling someone that their build looks like it
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 16:51:06 looks like it but it looks pretty cool
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 16:51:13 idk how thats gonna fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 16:51:36 the camo u used looks nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:01:06 u even made a mouth
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:01:12 and eyes
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:01:30 that is a sunfish
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:01:55 so it was a sunffish? or a sunfish themed spaceship?
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:02:20 oh so it just VERY coincidently looks exactly like a sunfish?
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:02:27 oh so u just embraced it
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:02:30 cool
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 18:27:57 Fr there was a guy in the server talking about autism making people less of a human but sure I get banned
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:40:56 That’s against tos but what I said isn’t
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:41:07 Still very extreme
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:14:22 Do you really need more ocean? I would say more small islands and seafloor variation with caves to explore
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 21:43:30 how much does the speaker gamepass cost
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 21:44:31 can u tell me im banned and roblox isnt letting me see

plane-crazy 2023-04-02 22:17:43 so a ball?
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 01:13:07 vaping simulator
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 01:13:44 basically no matter how the thing its attached to moves, it stays in the same orientation
bot-central 2023-04-03 01:19:41 !rank
creations-chat 2023-04-03 02:09:49 3 fs, 2 is boring(just gray), 1 is on a lot o jets(opinion)
creations-chat 2023-04-03 03:18:40 that doesnt have enough prototype in it
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:19:42 why does this community hate mechs? whenever i see one in <#384025409945337856> it gets downvoted like hell, most dont even look that bad
creations-chat 2023-04-03 03:21:03 solid choice; why is the chat cooldown so long
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:27:54 they take a lot of effort to make work well
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:28:03 yeah they suck to operate but theyre pretty cool
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:31:25 idk if im just imagining it but did someone make a christ the redeemer statue where the head opened up and it was a missile silo
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:31:33 idk if i just imagined that or if its real
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:31:40 did someone actually make that
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:37:17 i would just not put it into creations
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:37:30 i like my builds and i dont want them to be hated on for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:38:06 yeah exactly
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:38:41 some madlad made a 10k block cargo plane FLY but has 1 upvote and like 30 downvotes
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:39:16 no one in creations looks at the actual performance, just how it looks
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:15 thats true
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:29 but dont let it affect your confidence some people just hate for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:52 i have seen beautiful builds get 50 downvotes and meme shitposts with like 10 blocks get 100 upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:57 its just stupid
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:41:07 like i get it haha funny meme but what about the actual nice builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:43:39 how does THIS get into hall of fame
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:43:44 but THIS is horrible
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:44:27 i mean yeah but cmon thats a hof but this has an above 1:20 like to dislike ratio?
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:44:40 pretty nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:45:53 credits to rbk123https://streamable.com/ru1ml9
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:46:12 yeah ig
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:48:02 the tail end doesnt rise up steep enough but the front is really nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:48:07 i think ik why u got hate for it
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:49:00 the horizontal wings at the back are really plain and become worse when its in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:49:12 let people enjoy the game
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:53:45 wha
general 2023-04-03 03:58:04 the rockwell star raker is such a weird plane even for a concept, like its WAY too good to be true, if you told a three year old to come up with a great space plane, thats what theyd think of
general 2023-04-03 03:59:02 100 ton payload, single stage to orbit, airbreathing ramjet with a cryo rocket engine,
general 2023-04-03 03:59:06 thats so unrealistic
general 2023-04-03 04:00:53 well yeah but this is an actual aircraft manufacturing company coming up with a genuinely serious idea
general 2023-04-03 04:01:36 basicalyl
general 2023-04-03 04:01:49 it was even going to somehow be a vtol but they ditched that
general 2023-04-03 04:02:28 oh yeah good point
general 2023-04-03 04:02:31 frfr
general 2023-04-03 04:02:47 the pilot is way to close to the engines but its ok
general 2023-04-03 04:02:55 plus whats all the front part for
general 2023-04-03 04:03:28 really? canonically?
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:56:28 the more advanced vehicles become, the easier they are to make in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:57:36 quaileer more like poopyhead
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:57:39 OWNED
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:58:20 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 05:02:19 dumbleer
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 05:02:41 replace the quail in ur name with stu and replace the leer in ur name with pid
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 05:02:43 whats ur new name
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 05:02:45 OWNED
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:07:59 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:48:09 why is angle locking so stupid now
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:48:17 maybe im just bad at building
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:48:25 but the motor lock isnt staying locked
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:32:32 why does the wing kill itself in flight
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:32:40 im not even going that fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:32:43 ime going 400
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:32:51 the wing is motorlocked
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:33:40 theres no motor 2's in the entire build
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:34:43 the wing collapses in
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:34:58 wait its always the left wing let me see if theres something wrong with it
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:40:29 alr thanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:42:14 on the locked motors?
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:44:21 what in the
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:44:30 the wings keep clipping through the body
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:45:24 all the motors are locked so idk what torque would do
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:45:27 it does
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:46:17 oh phew i fixed it
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:46:38 its bcs one of the motors was used for angle locking so the wing kept pivoting but i replaced it with a block and now it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 03:48:53 my thoughts exactly
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:36:41 I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT AUDIO WHAT IS IT
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:43:50 you killed a platypus?
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:47:41 idk it looked like it had a bill
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:47:53 maybe that was the tail
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:48:08 yeah true unless hes a very small human
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:48:59 the tail is kinda short
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:49:10 it might be a woodchuck? thats a huge stretch
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:49:35 the fur matches though
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 01:34:09 use him as snapping turtle bait
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 01:34:30 cottonmouths?
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 02:42:18 who starts building at the engine cover
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 02:42:24 also it looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:32:28 thank you
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:33:15 THATS HOW PEOPLE KEEP BOMBING MY SUBS
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:33:30 never occured to me
general 2023-04-06 13:25:30 well yeah but dont jedis need to like activate their own lightsaber crystal? im pretty sure in one movie they do something similar to what you said but with a gigantic lightsaber crystal
general 2023-04-06 13:25:54 the death star laser also ran on kyber crystals
general 2023-04-06 13:26:35 they can use the lightsabers of the order 66 jedi, not like they need any more
general 2023-04-06 13:26:58 **human papillomavirus**
general 2023-04-06 13:27:03 why
general 2023-04-06 13:27:27 bruh
general 2023-04-06 13:27:42 havent watched the mandolorian
general 2023-04-06 13:28:57 no disney plus :(((((((
general 2023-04-06 14:53:17 if the ship is small enough then definetly
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 02:59:27 sry if this is a dumb question but how do i motorlock a bunch of hoverdrive together
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 02:59:40 im new to motorlocking and i need like a really tall stack of hover drives
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 02:59:54 any help or pictures is appreciated
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 03:00:17 tyty
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 03:29:00 tysm
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 03:29:28 bcs theyre mostly russian
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 03:29:48 i have seen like 3 non american carriers and they were all charles de gualle
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 03:29:58 every battle ship is either american, german, or british
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:11:11 are the motor settings powered and lock?(the tower ones)
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:13:23 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:13:49 i build those towers sometimes and it only works with powered on as well but that may be just bcs im bad at building
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:20:43 oh ok yeah im probably building wrong
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:20:47 ty for ur help
general 2023-04-07 13:33:29 that will be 2 million reichmarks
general 2023-04-07 13:35:19 normal plane crazy is fine besides the motor 2 glitch
general 2023-04-07 13:35:27 you dont need pc2 that desperately
general 2023-04-07 13:35:29 maybe for map changes
general 2023-04-07 13:35:31 and optimisation
general 2023-04-07 13:35:34 but thats all
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:44:56 i have a plane with exposed motorlock and physically cant cover it up
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:27 yeah but this literally looks DISGUSTING
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:32 it ruins the entire build
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:36 and theres no way around it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:40 alr
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:00 wrong ss
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:02 oopsies
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:39 idk who that guy is but hes near the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:42 see
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:44 on the wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:47:50 it looks like garbage
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:48:03 it sticks out like a sore thumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:48:27 the rest of the build is semi decent but that specifici part
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:49:09 tf lmfao
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:51:33 the only VERY annoying plane crazy bug is when u turn on night mode, and switch to day mode, its SO DIM
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:56:26 EW THE MOTORLOCK IS WORSE
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:56:52 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:57:46 this?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:04 its meant to be a cockpit window<:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:12 its the darkstar from topgun
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:28 bcs the whole thing is only two blocks wide and i refuse to piston lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:58:51 eh idk still sticks out a bit but the angle makes it worse
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:59:09 OH WAIT THAT WAS YOU????
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:59:21 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:59:23 alr
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:01:20 in my reference they were no where near that small(might also be the angle)
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:19 f35 looks pretty ugly imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:40 f22 looks ok but still kinda eh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:47 most 5th gens look pretty bland
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:09:54 f 104 looks pretty nice imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:10:19 the wings are kinda thin but i like the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:10:35 performance wise it was amazing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:10:54 down swept rear wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:03 scandalous
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:55 this is probably a terrible take but the u2 also looks pretty cool minus the pencil wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:59 fsfs
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:12:04 lancer looks really nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:06 yeah but the thing needed wing tip supports with wheels to take off, so that was probably the least of their problems
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:20 i really like the panavia tornado f3
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:59 ew
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:03 WOAH
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:32 i think we can all agree this shoulve been a kamikaze plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:57 btw im leaving the server
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:17:13 the zero has a nice canopy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:17:43 so clean
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:18:27 i dont like the f16 either
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:18:46 convertible version
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:19:18 isnt it extrememly small compared to other jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:19:39 mouth intake and single rear stabilizer
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:03 yak141 moment
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:30 looks equally goofy imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:55 EW THATS WHAT I MEAN
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:58 JUMPSCARE WARNING
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:01 MOUTH INTAKE
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:37 as if the f15 wasnt beautiful enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:54 btw this was just a one off prototype used as a testbed for some stuff
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:07 yeah basically
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:19 it was much better performance though
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:28 in a dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:57 that was the only livery it had but yeah i agree
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:24:40 :0
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:24:52 thats just the intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:01 but i see ur point
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:48 plane crazy model jet fr
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:55 vought f7u
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:04 by far the best looking aircraft imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:18 the fact that this thing was in the skies in the 60s is amazing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:24 15 years after ww2 ended
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:28:08 1941 was the first jet fighter(me 262), 1964 was this beauty
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:28:32 a bunch of people say "if we know about that jet, theres probably something better flying around"
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:28:56 THE 60S, WE WENT TO THE MOON IN THE 60S
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:01 wow
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:59 there is only one force greater than god and it is the united states department of defense
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:37 i want what 60s engineers were on bcs my god they landed on the moon, and created the fastest manned air breathy aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:31:57 why would u need stealth aircraft on a carrier
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:53 stealth aircraft are meant for long range i think
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:33:03 like the b2 has a whole four seasons up there somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:04 damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:19 build a boat is like blender but shittier
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:36:09 i HeAr MaD vUlPeN hAs a GoOd tUtOrIaL oN iT
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:36:47 it looks fine before you do that thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:39:04 in my defense of this atrocity, my reference was pretty bad, and i cant use half wedges bcs the whole nose and fuselage is two blocks wide, if the half wedges touch each other, its too short, if theres a 1 block gap, its too far apart, so this is the best i can do without harry potter magic
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:02 yeah it does in the image it doesnt show very well but it only sticks out by 1/4 of a block
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:19 thats extremely good for roscale
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:49 idk i just think roscale is like 1 seat wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:59 yeah the f14 is a huge plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:10 how tf do u center a seat in a 2 wide plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:52 you can use angle lock to shift something by only half a block?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:58 i thought that was piston lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:18 oh shit yeah mb im just dumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:19 i knew that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:38 OH THATS WHAT YOU MEANT
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:58 yeah thats roscale to me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:43:22 two blocks side by side; not half block, block, and another half block
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:45:36 cool c130 hercules (joke)
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:48:37 i got jet shamed by a mad vulpen tut
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:48:50 like the guy with the f14 said my jet sucked
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:08 someone had the audacity to build a hangar for it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:24 namnam
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:30 bruh why does weight matter so much
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:43 im not using 20000 different materials on each block so i weigh a gram less
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:57 stalemate
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:30 most of them forget to lock their trapdoors so you can just go open a few and completely screw up their aero
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:23 i only use helium in bombers
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:52:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:08 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:10 afterburners
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:27 trails+smoke pipe
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:45 that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:54 thats sweet
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:06 i throw in a smoke pipe to give it that kinda twitch
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:45 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:01 depends on ur jet speed
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:08 whats ur jets average speed?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:22 i find that for around 800-100, 0.01 works best
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:30 0.02
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:47 do u want rgb values?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:55 for this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:57:33 ima give a quick tut on my afterburners
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:58:13 smoke pipe these settings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:58:30 trails like this for a jet that goes roughly 800
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:59:01 the orange on my jet is on 250, 160, 150; and the purple is 150, 150, 255
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:59:50 put 2 trails, one purple one orange, in front of the smoke pipe
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:00:15 its modified for faster jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:00:22 its jsut the rgb that i used
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:00:27 and to be smaller
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:00:41 i liked the colors he used, i'll give him credit for that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:01 what if i leave a game mid flight
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:09 color doesnt change
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:18 even if u paint it white its still the same
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:24 stick with the default though
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:42 it works on teh snow pipe so idk why it doesnt here
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:59 no u cant, snow pipe does that, not smoke pipe
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:03:06 thats the default
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:04:02 any gray looks the same, even white, but not neon pink
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:04:05 mb on that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:04:17 yeah it was mb i didnt know both could do it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:06:46 psychopath
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:06:56 you definetly have people tied up in your basement
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:04 everyone does, printer means bottom up
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:09 same tbh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:19 someone's tied up somewhere then
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:39 like 3d printer or paper printer?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:49 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:53 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:16 thats not a thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:19 youre screwing with me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:27 IT IS????
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:37 oh that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:40 i knew that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:09:16 well yeah no one starts with vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:26 can i motorlock motorlock into motorlocked motorlock? its a genuine question, i have a tower and a horizontal line that needs to intersectt, so do i motorlock the motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:30 is that possible?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:36 ik the phrasing is garbage
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:11:12 does motorlocking add weight bcs sometimes i make super tall towers to weight down part of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:11:47 oh....
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:11:53 i completely forgot about that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:12:11 i am going to close discord and reminisce about the time i have wasted
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:14:02 Making a helicopter fly decently  kills me internally
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:14:07 They’re so annoying
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:16:09 M2m helis are in my nightmares especially for rp, helis should be wasd imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:17:51 That’s only for the gjsolo helis which are just jets with a prop blade on top
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:17:58 They maneuver so unnaturally
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:19:53 Sticknub’s ch53 king stallion is perfection, it’s literally the most perfect helicopter imaginable
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 16:18:38 Just use small propellers you don’t need to be doing all that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:26:50 can someone send me the emojis they use to add detail on planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:26:56 like yk the black square thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:29:01 hashtagged
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:29:35 anything i do gets hashtagged
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:29:44 i was asking if someone had a unique one
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 23:30:27 thanks ._.
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:53:37 does this at all resemble the darkstar from topgun
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:54:05 yeah ik the cockpit sucks but the fuselage 2 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:55:15 yeah idk whats wrong with the ss either
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:55:33 i turned on night, and then switched to day, and everything looks like a calculator display now
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:56:42 someone told me to use it to see their build
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:56:57 is there anything specifically wrong with it or does it just suck
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:57:10 it was actually nice it was like a "bedroom" thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:57:44 yeah its only 2 blocks wide and the lock is basically impossible to hide
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:57:55 ITS A NAVY PLANE?????
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:03 (i havent watched topgun)
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:07 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:10 its a naval academy
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:11 oh shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:13 im so stupid
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:58:23 yeah i agree
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:00:31 ESTUPIDO
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:03:00 if it helps this was early 2021
general 2023-04-10 23:04:00 do the side parts of the sr 71 taper in towards the wings?
general 2023-04-10 23:04:09 or is it just straight directly to the wings
general 2023-04-10 23:04:50 i cant in general
general 2023-04-10 23:04:55 i can send them in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:05:02 
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:05:07 do they taper in like that?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:05:31 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:06:17 so like that?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:06:24 im not done with that part
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:06:29 oh ok ty
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:48:45 why?
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:48:50 also how the hell
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:49:04 is there some kind of joke im missing out on
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:49:29 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 23:49:40 why was i sent to the shadow realm?
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:49:00 1 hour no messages
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:49:43 what no
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:49:46 it was 1 hour
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:50:15 no im in pst it says 4:49 and then 5:49
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:50:32 oh boy that was a lot of typos
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:50:42 5:49 when it sent my messages
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:50:44 so yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 00:50:45 1 hour
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:00:48 i hate motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:01:01 im making custom landing gear and it keeps sending the wheel upwards into the plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:01:29 yeah but when i spawn  it in the wheel just goes up and gets stuck with some of the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:01:35 oh yeah good idea
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:02:22 well i need a limit to how much the gear can turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:03:22 motor settings
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:03:39 motor unspawned
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:09 motor when spawned
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:13 m1 has the same issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:14 
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:25 the cylinder sticks up at the top
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:41 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:46 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:04:51 alr ty
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:05:04 its a decently big motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:05:19 thats why theres the tower lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:05:23 im stacking hover drives
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:05:33 i'll just put the gear elsewhere
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:06:59 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:07:18 i just sacrificed some looks for my sanity
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:07:28 now the front looks weird but atleast theres gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 07:08:03 thank you for ur help
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:26:52 just use a stationary 3rd person camera
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:01 like mounted a bit off the back of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:13 and build a hud system
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:33 i agree but i dont see an alternative unless you want an ugly go pro system on ur plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:30:15 https://tenor.com/view/screaming-internally-nervous-gif-12650126
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:31:36 please stop
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:31:59 check ur notifs man 😭
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:40:28 motor 2 is so dumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:40:42 im using it for custom landing gear and when i taxi it just collapses
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 23:55:50 wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 23:56:41 if its rocking up and down towards the nose, put horizontal wing panels motorlocked in the nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 23:56:51 if its shaking side to side a lot, vertical wing panels in the mose
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:00:35 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:00:51 put more maybe
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:01:02 or move the thrust towards the front if youre going overkill with the engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:13:07 a6m zero
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:13:16 make sure u add its special weapon
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:13:30 jk make like a mosquito bomber

plane-crazy 2023-04-12 21:09:33 how does superspeed work
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 21:09:36 i bought the gamepass
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 21:32:35 @everyοne
creations-chat 2023-04-12 21:47:02 best build i have ever seen
creations-chat 2023-04-16 21:30:57 the wing paint job is really good
creations-chat 2023-04-16 21:38:39 yeah maybe i just really like how you motorlocked it; plane looks amazing too
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 21:45:06 i have spent 20 minutes angle locking something that couldve been camera locked
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 21:45:57 and i just realized it coulve been camera locked
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 21:57:53 YOU WANT TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING TURN WITH CONTROL PANELS???
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 21:58:06 if you want mouse control use m2m
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 21:58:17 or just make custom flaps and elevators
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 22:09:09 mouse to motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 22:09:10 basically
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 22:09:25 you can create powerful control surfaces(custom) and still have them be mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 22:09:39 you can look at a quick guide bcs im not exactly sure how to do it
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 22:09:42 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:16:14 what plane even is this
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:17:19 oh
general 2023-04-17 01:23:05 WAIT ACTUALLY???
general 2023-04-17 01:23:10 IS IT A TEST OR LAUNCH?
general 2023-04-17 01:23:42 frfr
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:31:18 what if its lag and u think its anchoring so you press the anchor key and actually anchor it
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:31:24 and then press it again and unanchor it
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:33:08 neon pink and neon blue
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:33:49 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:34:28 
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:34:33 why isnt this camera locking
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:34:42 like why does it revert to upright when i spawn it
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:48:19 lime green
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:48:30 actually paint all of it black
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:48:32 all of it
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 05:15:02 more than an hour no messages
general 2023-04-17 05:15:38 me when the
general 2023-04-17 05:15:58 me when
general 2023-04-17 05:16:18 dm me
general 2023-04-17 05:16:34 i will give u one more
general 2023-04-17 05:16:55 i have one for the su 57
general 2023-04-17 05:17:05 i use it to make my builds accurate
general 2023-04-17 05:17:41 we have similar ones so nvm
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 22:33:46 thats not even fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 22:33:57 i have functional aircraft that go that fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 22:34:43 by functional i mean like decent looking with an airframe, landing gear, control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 00:17:49 good luck getting that to fly with all the delta wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 02:57:42 piston lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 02:57:56 that defeats the whole point of the game
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 02:58:03 the point of the game is to make planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 02:58:06 not buy them
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 02:58:37 also even for buying blocks is kinda dumb bcs that inhibits your building ability in a sandbox game designed for u to build whatever u want
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 23:43:47 cam lock is so goofy
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 23:43:56 i have multiple small car things with camera lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 23:44:07 but the camera locked parts all connect to only one car
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 23:44:12 its so weird
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 00:25:55 like 3 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 00:26:00 2~ blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 00:26:04 and its like a bunch of them

general 2023-05-06 15:00:45 💀
general 2023-05-06 15:01:05 are u the guy who said someone's huey was fake?
general 2023-05-06 15:01:44 i couldnt find the message
general 2023-05-06 15:01:48 is it actually fake?
