plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:40:55 does this seem good? the holes on the side are for the wings and the holes on the top are for the motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:41:18 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:42:06 so if i add the wings itll look better?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:47:44 i just realised i dont know how to make wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:48:27 errr like this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:48:29 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:49:36 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:51:07 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:21:29 :((
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:21:55 should i move the wings up
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:22:08 cuz the plane dips down when i fly
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:22:27 darth vader
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:22:53 oh.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:23:29 well is there anything i can do to improve
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:25:11 how do i improve my fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:25:27 i dont understand anything ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:28:36 well at least tell me how to improve it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:50:17 ???
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:50:37 anyways how do i make a good fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:52:43 hey tooty
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:56:27 i just wanted help
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:58:02 so i mean how do i make a good fuselage then? i mean if its bad, what makes it bad?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:36:58 is this a gud plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:37:12 well is it even a plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:37:14 i cant tell
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:37:51 ill take that as a no
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:38:17 idk man i tried making a plane ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:38:32 it suprisingly handles gud tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:40:11 hey man its my first plane since 2 years ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:40:47 my plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:43:45 also why do you keep calling my fuselage bad but proceed not to tell me why
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:45:22 hes gonna talk
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:48:02 you wanna see some bad planes?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:48:15 i made this when i first started playin
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:50:33 so how do i make a good plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 20:56:06 ok from my perspective  i have no idea what that is
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:13:38 is this looking good?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:13:44 cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:13:48 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:14:02 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:14:27 well is it kinda better than the cockpit from my other plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:14:59 oki
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:21:16 err now is this better?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:21:33 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:24:14 im tryna make this look sharper but idk how to
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:25:03 whats pcc
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:25:32 doesnt sound real but ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:26:16 damn im stupid
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:27:17 oo thats me
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:18 whats roscale, is it like some type of building technique
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:30:07 so pretty much trying to make planes as realistic as the real thing?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:30:30 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:31:18 oh crap advance stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:36:03 i feel like i made it worse
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:36:40 just a jet, im not really basing it off anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:38:55 does it look better by any chance bubbington
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:30 damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:38 motor locking?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:56 i can do that vertically for like rockets but thats about it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:42:09 oh boy
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:42:33 ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:44:57 man i suck at making planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:50:41 a while ago yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:56:36 is it possible to motor lock from bottom to top
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:57:12 as in 
making the bottom motor line up with the motor in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:57:27 like can it go up
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:58:07 yea it doesnt seem be the right way to motor lock it cause it ends up not locking
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:58:40 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:58:50 theres blocks holding it but if i were to remove it the motor would fall
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:00:07 the side of the motor?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:01:45 im just gonna
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:01:50 redo the entire front
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:05:50 i dont even know how to make the front with motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:06:46 i dont get it how your supposed to use motor locks for design
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 22:17:29 can someone tell me how to use motor lock for designing
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 20:45:08 does anyone see something wrong with my plane?
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 20:46:42 i may have drove the plane into a couple of rockets
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 20:47:00 lets just say i cant go up and down anymore
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:10:08 can someone teach me how to use motor lock for design
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:10:16 looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:10:34 reminds me of the flintstones
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:12:18 it didnt end well
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:12:59 damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:16:17 when should i learn motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:17:11 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:18:12 well ive havent played for 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:18 as in should i learn now or later
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:36 alr
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:39 no i have
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:46 its just that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:52 ive only known how to use it for
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:19:55 rockets
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:20:01 not design
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:20:49 ???
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:21:27 motors?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:45:46 can someone teach me how to use motor locking for design like this
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:46:35 idk how, im the worst at making planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:47:22 okay
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:47:39 is just that i dont know how to use it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:48:05 like people say i should use motor locking for the design cause it looks bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:49:24 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:50:16 tailedfox how do i *use* the motor locking for building tho? i can build it, i just dont know how to use it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:51:13 ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:51:20 well i mostly mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:51:26 i dont know how to use it in certain ways
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:51:31 like if its needed or its not
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:51:40 i dont know how to determine that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:52:25 i see that but im making a plane bigger with a longer nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:54:09 like would i use it like this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:54:28 its just that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:54:32 it sticks out
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:54:43 alr gimmie a sec
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:54:56 
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:55:14 do i remove that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:55:27 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:56:08 so i would decrease the wideness by a half block?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:57:32 so increase the highlighted part by a half block?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:59:13 i wish plane crazy made it so you can move placed blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:59:44 like this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:00:05 and then make the nose not touch the uhh motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:00:16 alr i think i kinda got it now
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:02:21 so like this?
i dont think i did it right
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:03:32 ye as in i did it right or i didnt do it right
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:03:37 cause it still doesnt contract fully
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:03:54 
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:04:31 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:04:37 so ill remove em?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:05:26 aha!
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:06:18 so if the motor is being help from the top and bottom its ok?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:06:26 about 7
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:06:32 looks good
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:07:38 i wonder, will motor locks be included in the next plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:09:02 ive heared people talkin about another plane crazy comming out or is it just like a fake thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:09:46 i got rickrolled ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:11:01 eh i couldnt find anything talkin about motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:11:09 wait am i being dumb
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:11:29 oh that sucks
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:12:21 gliding as in planes moving without rockets n stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:12:35 what was its intended feature?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:13:23 ahh ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:15:18 <@619312093962829849> 
does this look better than the original look?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:15:43 i think its a tad more smoother
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:16:36 welp
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:16:39 its progress
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:17:30 is there a wedge that can fit that tiny corner on the nose?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:18:10 too tall
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:18:37 ah ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:22:57 hey can you help with something again?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:23:45 i need somthing to cover the hole but when i place a block down to cover it up, its too close to the motor and the motor lock doesnt contract all the way
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:25:02 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:25:09 i can just use a half wedge
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:25:28 no im the other side now
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:25:36 but i fixed it anyway
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:26:34 should i motor lock the top part? i think its a bit high
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:26:43 wait
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:26:55 i dont think im gonna have any room for the motors anyway
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:33:48 are triangle wedges good for the nose?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:38:44 alr, also is half blocks or blocks better
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:48:48 <@619312093962829849> is the cockpit too long?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:48:50 
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:49:15 damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:49:28 yea building is hard for me
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:54:35 is this better?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:54:36 
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:54:54 epic
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:54:59 alr imma stop for now
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 02:55:04 its 10pm for me

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:27:56 nothing, im making it up
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:28:12 it just a jet i didnt really base it off anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:30:02 well i did look up some jets, im mostly combining the design of them from my memory
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:30:55 im on laptop and not really
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:31:05 ive had my laptop for about 2 years so far
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:31:15 oh lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:31:22 uh yea im new to that sort of
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:31:29 i had stopped playing for about 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:32:17 for it to be smaller try cutting off the end of the glass
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:32:28 thats what i did to make it smaller
the-dump 2022-06-05 03:54:17 ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:54:28 whats the difference between a half wedge
and a half wedge
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:56:15 smh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:58:31 how do i make this look less like a stick
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:58:37 
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:58:55 ok

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 04:11:01 <@619312093962829849> 
ik i said i was gonna stop playing but i decided not to
anyways is this good?

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:00:07 also how do i make the nose stop dipping down
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:16:35 ive done it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:16:58 a jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:17:05 its not based on anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:18:08 ik but it looks kinda cool, this photo is a bit old cause i added some panels on the front to help the nose from not diving
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:19:18 well its my first complete plane ive made after 2 years of not playing
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:19:35 thanks 😄
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:19:45 ok but i should really sleep
its 2 am for me
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 06:19:46 cya
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:36:21 hey i know i should be alsleep but about that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:37:26 now its furturistic
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:38:43 lucridous speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:39:18 its not based off of anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:45:59 i added some
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:46:05 "advanced tech"
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 07:54:23 so uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:11:13 <@619312093962829849> are you there? i finished the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:12:33 i added something cool to it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:13:03 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:13:17 i saw it when i was watching one of those plane basic videos
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:14:28 i think i just gotta add the back and color it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:15:24 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:17:00 ik
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:17:07 anyways does it look cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:17:13 like the wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:24:46 gliding in minecraft
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:26:35 what have i done
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:26:56 i kinda tried to make the uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:27:08 back part of the jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:27:11 idk what its called
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:27:21 ig
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:27:38 well idk angle lockings so thats a start
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:29:25 does it look a lil bit better?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:31:02 yup i cant do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:35:42 i am asian
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:35:48 how do you make

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:12:34 how make plane look less like stick
help 2022-06-05 20:33:15 why does the motor lock not lock all the way?
help 2022-06-05 20:36:38 oh
help 2022-06-05 20:37:58 so in order to make motors lock smaller i would do somthing like this?
help 2022-06-05 20:43:58 should a nose for a jet be wider than it is taller or be as wide as it is tall
help 2022-06-05 20:44:40 alr
help 2022-06-05 20:50:59 ok

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:17 like the bottom?
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:46 not exactly sure how to tell
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:52 do i replace the ones facing down?
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:28:53 i replaced the springs with the disconnectors cause im not sure which is causing the problem
(that exposed landing gear is giving me cancer)
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:30:16 alr
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:31:48 a bunch of springs got loose so thats good
but some still got stuck

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:32:03 so it wont stick
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:32:16 it shows

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:28:19 im trying to make a biplane
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:28:30 but the wings in the front are too much
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:28:31 i hate this
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:31:15 solution

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:31:37 i wonder if i should use motors to control the front wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:48:22 sure
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:49:26 btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:49:35 is a ballast tank heavier than a ballast block
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:52:35 agh

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 21:55:06 uh gimmie a min
