creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:29:54 no idea how to use camera lock but thank you, i'll try to figure it out
bot-central 2021-08-23 13:30:42 !rank
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:36:37 <@456226577798135808>  it's good but i don't think the slate material is a good idea for the pipes, as for the paint you should try to use less saturated colours.
40, 45, 50 or 50, 50, 50 for the wheels would be good
search up steampunk colour palletes online aswell
colour pallete ideas:
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/88040
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/52100
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1865
i suggest trying to work with all of the shades of brown + a green/green-blue colour and a soft black which i gave you the rgb colours for above
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:39:07 maybe you could also try to incorporate more motor lock into your build to add on detail
use online references of steampunk cars too for ideas
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:54:56 <@!695983848575598664>  got another camera angle? like a side view of the turret
i think the smoke kind of ruins it for me, try to increase the transparency of it and make it a tad darker
paint job is decent
wouldn't use rockets for the barrel
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:03:51 why do people spoiler pings
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:08:02 to me it looks like a mig-31 and f-14. plane isn't that bad but <@!758330155562696764>  you should use half wedges for the front rather than full wedges, try making the nose smaller and it'll look fine
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:51:02 plane crazy community i guess
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:54:26 i think the su-37 looks more like a su-37 than the saab j21r looks like a saab j21r

im talking about the GLASS being at least 1 block tall, not the whole plane itself

im not the only person who is trying to explain to you that the f-4 phantom doesn't have such a tiny canopy, small build or not
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:12:38 your build literally does not look anything like that, as i said im not the only person who is trying to explain to you that the canopy is too small

are you blind? compare your build to any f-4 variant. i am aware that the f-4's canopy is smaller than most other fighter aircraft but what some people here have already said and what i am trying to explain to you in the simplest terms that i can is that your build's canopy is too small, what do you not understand?
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:15:06 cockpit examples = examples of how f-4 cockpits look like = yours is too small

i don't care what you're making, most phantoms look like one of the things below, hence "examples"

creations-chat 2021-10-18 16:33:33 <@!626036997546442763>  very sexy ship, but there's not much variation in the colour so you should probably add some very slightly darker grey parts for bit more contrast and so that details stick out

general 2021-10-29 14:15:54 Just a quick update on the bot and automatically assigned roles situation, as there seems to be some confusion and some people are screaming "roblox got hacked!!"

Roblox did not get hacked. Once again they were not able to handle all the traffic that came with a huge update, this time from some Chipotle event. It broke pretty much all of Roblox, so our bots can't connect to the system for it to give you your roles.

Once Roblox is fully functioning again our bots will automatically give you back your roles, so no worries.

creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:40:21 could still fix the shape itself without motorlocking, reference off of real planes so you know how planes are supposed to look.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:43:29 that's where the s at the end of plane comes in, don't reference off of a single plane, look at a variety of designs, fictional and real, etc to give your plane a sense of realism while having unique aspect.

creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:39:36 shame because you look like you know  how to play the game properly, you're better off trying to remake the front so that it's actually your own üëç

creations-chat 2021-12-21 22:00:39 i could give more feedback if more picture angles, colours could be improved a bit as the white on the su-33's camo isn't the same white as used on the nose cone thingy. you could add lines on the cockpit aswell which would look nice if you blacked out the cockpit
overall is hot üëç

scratch the more angles thing, i just had a look at it in <#384025409945337856> , looks good to me, i can't name any other flaws other than the colour issue and maybe cockpit
creations-chat 2021-12-21 22:04:46 yes the paint is good but the white in pictures looks too white, make more blue, also i reccomend using colour picker from image website so you can upload a picture and nab the colours directly

cockpit fine anyway

creations-chat 2022-03-05 07:42:38 <@!499693926878281728>  very nice details, pulled off one of my personal favourite helicopters well but i think you need to  get better lighter and less saturated colours and when you take photos of your build turn up max graphics temporarily so it's easier to see and maybe take your screenshots a bit closer to the aircraft and not standing away from it, i feel like some of the screenshots should have been taken from inside of the cockpit, but either way good job üëç

creations-chat 2022-03-06 18:40:31 i know its supposed to be an ifv but i said that it looks very plain, not that it doesnt look like an ifv or has a bad camo. add more depth and detail to it with signs or something

creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:33:48 <@757760986848559256> the rotation of image is slightly off but i think you should take people's advice on the length, front looks very good though in my opinion
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:35:32 better pic for you + blueprint that i used
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:39:17 yeah but i think instead of measurements its much much better to just use blueprints/visual measurements, measuring by the eye is often a better approach to things like these and if you look at your build with the eye compared to an actual top down of a mirage 2000c you'll notice that the back is extremely short

help 2022-04-19 20:41:55 
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:43:19 fair enough but if youw ant to avoid people trying to attack like hungry dog cause of the length then i would strongly suggest rebuilding the rear, front is perfect tthough so good job nonetheless

creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:28:52 looks decent but i dont think cockpit should be glass since interior white stuff looks kinda shit and you could get more detail in the cockpit if you made it black with normal material

btw the gun infront of it that isnt attatched looks really chunky so i probably wouldnt put that on or id find a way to make it smaller/more visually appealing while functional
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:31:17 this is what i meant btw by "interior white stuff"

<@918581321004089364>  idk what you mean by the connected thing
also the guns could always be mounted on wing side thingies, theres also another more compact way to make that same gun with same amount of guns but less motor lock but youd have to check a yt video for it
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:34:22 im sorry english is my second language but the gun doesnt look attatched to the build (the build itself looks very far away in comparison to the gun and the gun is very very low down)
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:37:48 okay i have 0 fucking idea what im looking at, do you mind if i try to join you in a game so i can try give better feedback? 
if you let me know if you're in a vip that would be helpful if yes
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:47:41 it looks better but why is it floating off of the helicopter? you should really move it backwards and higher
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:49:47 sometimes you gotta decide whether its more ugly but better function or less ugly but slightly less function
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:53:40 dont remember saying that ü§®
i think you cnn'd me
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:57:51 üò¢ 
what i was trying to say was
i dont find joke like that funny and  i dunno why the guy would make that but aight
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:59:46 but i dont evne know you man üòî
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:02:17 nope, not even that active in here lol

üëç
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:08:59 i think hyperbot's time is coming
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:14:48 2nd picture looks a lot better, first one looks bent but i think you should colour the motor tower at the back and try to cover it up a bit
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:20:42 nono i mean the back by here
colours could use bit of work too i think
and maybe you could use something else to attatch ropes because instant thought is "did not hide motor lock" rather than "ah yes for the rope"
creations-chat 2022-04-29 21:55:52 colours awful (i think golden gste bridge meant to be red too) and needs a lot more detail + smoothening out
creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:32:11 <@673670368757678106>  the build looks very nice overall, it has a nice shape in my opinion and looks very much like a corsair but i really suggest doing some work on the colours, the blue seems way too bright / saturated and i think you should try taking colours directly from image (search image colour picker online) , maybe possibly smooth out the canopy somehow or add detail to it.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:35:04 i dont see how there's exposed lock anywhere, the only motors i see are for flaps and propellor + the wing folding lol
creations-chat 2022-05-11 20:18:32 <@845396941373833226>  is it a joke build
general 2022-05-31 18:02:59 cant you search how to fix wobble in plane crazy on youtube
general 2022-05-31 18:03:16 if you cant fix it with a tutorial maybe you need to just make a better jet
general 2022-05-31 18:03:52 doesnt it lag?
general 2022-05-31 18:04:08 i have a good pc but when i stack about 20 hovers in a jet my fps shits itself
general 2022-05-31 18:04:19 how do you check
general 2022-05-31 18:04:33 i have a legion 7
general 2022-05-31 18:04:35 but when i put
general 2022-05-31 18:04:43 hovers in a heavy motorlocked plane

creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:02:19 well it works now if you didnt notice, but either way really nice job on it, looks great, but it hink you should fill in the white bit in the image i attatched

creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:04:40 <@388730515823525889>  very very nice, but i think an interesting feature would be if you didnt do an exterior, you could have some kind of rotating thing on the outside of the build that could change the images that the submarine takes photos of like in the real game and make like pixelated photos or something that it cycles between
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:17:42 do you know how a revolver's reload system works? you could build it like that on the side of the submarine, with four images that rotate with a motor but make sure that everything else around it is black to keep the immersion. also maybe try to add that note thaat was on the floor if you didnt e ither with a paper emoji or a sign. also maybe you could try and see if anyone uploaded sound effects on roblox like with the creaking of the submarine when the thing moves or camera sfx. i woudnt be able to point you to any though since i havent played iron lung for a while but it's nice to see someone appreciating such an interesting game
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:36:08 im not sure if this diagram will help, but the grey box is approximately the submarine area, the red circle is a motor and then you can rotate the images along the motor like that to go infront of the submarine's camera thing
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:53:37 hi
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:34:58 i've watched this about 10 times because of how satisfying it looks, i know its the wrong size but you should really make a different build with that thing cause of how cool and smooth it is, how did you even make the moving part?
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:44:18 holy shit, thanks man, i appreciate the thorough explanation üëç 
very heavy or not,  its still an awesome concept
creations-chat 2022-08-02 21:49:07 "lets get some downvotes"
> upset over 11 downvotes

<@456226577798135808>  you seem a bit upset + even though its hard to build on mobile people mainly judge on appearance and yo useemed to expect downvotes so idk why you're surprised
creations-chat 2022-08-02 21:51:49 ok but why complaining over 11 downvotes
what score did you expect <@456226577798135808>  cause you seemed to expect downvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-09 23:23:36 <@804692015887417375>  nice and clean, maybe  add trapdoors for details  on wings but it looks  pretty good otherwise

<@658318819248570381>  the engines look good for the size imo but could  bei mproved tbh
creations-chat 2022-08-09 23:36:00 captured it very well too, might be nice to see some other kinds of armaments but i dont know much about the j-8b at all
perhaps try putting disconnectors or details around the drop tanks

also like the guy said below maybe the engines could use work too but overall the plane looks good imo
general 2022-08-13 23:23:59 i thought this was a build for a moment with reshade
general 2022-08-13 23:24:08 üò¢
creations-chat 2022-08-15 23:49:01 <@551806781609869313>  satisfying to see new vs old chinook in same angle, improvements look good well done üëç
 but the back rotor area (wouldnt know what to call it) could maybe use a bit of work. the sea chinook one is a bit less curved and there's a few more details i think you could put but overall great imo
also maybe change the colour of it to white/grey or something, i know few sea knights are olive but i personally think a grey would look better
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:04:16 i only call it chinook because sea knight is part of the chinook family, sorry lol
the rotor housing (thanks for the correct term) could still use more detail but like i said looks good üëç
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:08:34 looks roughly the same to some1 who doesnt know shit about helicopters ü§∑
creations-chat 2022-08-23 22:03:22 <@745004934222577684>  why the watermark lol

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:13:49 how good is this for someone with 5 hours playtime (not my plane)
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:06 my friend has only ever made 2 planes in this game after being taught by someone how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:08 and he says he only has 5 hours
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:44 
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:49 5 when he finished it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:17:08 y
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:17:46 he spent 3 hours of his play time copying another friend of mine's plane but he only spent 2 hours making a bomber and that plane i sent
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:17:56 make a su-30
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:18:12 you have 5 hours play time
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:18:20 i dont think yo uneeed to worry about that
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:18:54 depends what scale
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:19:25 go look in <#384025409945337856>  for examples
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:19:33 some people make really big tanks but some make them pretty small
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:20:48 not very good at them
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:20:58 cause you use motors to fold the different pieces together
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:21:12 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:23:17 looks very good
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:23:25 nice colours
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:23:46 its not a military ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:24:19 make your own militarised britannic no balls
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:24:58 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:25:31 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:25:35 join call

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:29:11 why did you put a cannon on it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:29:20 
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:29:27 the motor lock one you made ingame
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:29:36 its a tu-22
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:30:23 you're weird
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:30:41 <@853253570202828820>  you should post your plane in creations when you finish it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:02 upvotes and get colour role
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:08 but you need to talk in chat a bit for image perms i think
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:41 reddit karma
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:51 that was a joke
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:12 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:43 get 90 upvote total
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:52 or score
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:57 the score is upvotes - downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:00 i think
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:15 shouldnt be too hard for you
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:17 you picked up game very well
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:27 i have 1,200 hours on the game and i cant make mini planes like you
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:07 you need to fill in the spine <@853253570202828820>
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:30 ^ <@853253570202828820>  you have a really really strong start i think
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:35 but a bit of practice wont hurt
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:40 so you should probably try making more planes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:50 practice
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:57 = reddit karma (joke)
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:35:01 = colour role
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:35:52 no unless you want the expert role for ships
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:36:09 look at swag cat roles
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:36:11 he has ship one
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:36:22 focus on designer first maybe
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:36:32 cause it covers basically anything as long as 90 score
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:37:00 <#925563336500871268>  <@853253570202828820>
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:37:35 i dont evne know if anyone has that
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:38:06 <@853253570202828820>  i think people like realism more than custom planes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:38:18 probably not an f-4 or a f-14
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:38:24 cause so many people make those
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:39:19 f-16
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:39:43 j-17 or mig 21
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:39:48 or mig 15
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:39:54 since you wipe floor with people on dcs with these
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:40:35 would have to be very detailed if making small plane <@853253570202828820>
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:09 idk
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:24 <@992189220837937172>  he has like
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:28 2 hours playtime of building his own shit
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:41 but hes rlly good

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:43:03 most mig 21 ive seen in creations gets downvoted a lot
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:43:06 cause it simple plane to make
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:43:20 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:43:21 be unique

creations-chat 2022-09-09 06:18:14 yea but proportions on it are a nightmare
creations-chat 2022-09-09 14:18:01 looks 10x better good job
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:10:38 looks very clean idk why the planet making guy calls it gay
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:13:06 smooth it out by adding longer wedges at the edges on top and bottom and sides so it wont look like triangle
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:38:55 proportions look just fine + its smooth

creations-chat 2023-05-26 06:20:00 <@862160384206962749>  its really clean but i think the image quality doesnt do it any justice, maximise your graphics and take far closer screenshots and maybe people will find it more visually appealing. either way nice colouring, its very cool
creations-chat 2023-05-26 15:22:18 well imo it looks clean, nice work
creations-chat 2023-05-27 07:53:54 assuming these are old vs new , old nose looks more like raptor, new one too sharp
nice job tho, looks a lot cleaner all round
