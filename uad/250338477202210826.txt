plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:41:05 *oof its 9:40 pm*
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:41:49 not rly, bc discord voice calls, and i got one of my friends to do it in 5 minutes
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:42:21 but it might get repetitive so i might jus tmake a video
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:46:55 when u forget roblox is still open so ur just sitting in the community vip
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:55:16 that 230k save data's getting awfully uncomfortable for me
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:20:23 whos in the community vip atm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:21:29 i like the pattern my spinny boi makes when i die
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:26:52 bc my spinny boi explodes in a cross shape, if i make it fly and then reset, do we now have fireworks?
general 2018-11-19 06:30:01 when spinny boi explodes
general 2018-11-19 06:31:39 i would be better if it was night time cuz of the 300 thrusters
general 2018-11-19 06:32:18 (this is the orignal form)
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:33:43 just rename urself dyno, change pic, and have a clipboard manager rdy for quick reactions
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:34:41 oof
general 2018-11-19 06:35:27 firework is primed and rdy for launch and detonation on community vip
general 2018-11-19 06:36:14 bc sometimes ppl complain ab lag
general 2018-11-19 06:36:44 it lags, is an effective entry denial device, and is a firework
general 2018-11-19 06:37:17 it just looks like a spinning cross wen it spins
general 2018-11-19 06:37:34 except it gains another 4 arms cuz frames
general 2018-11-19 06:38:45 best of all, wen it explodes it keeps its sphere shape
general 2018-11-19 06:39:23 oh and normaly it has wheels so its an effective trollling device
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:42:15 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:15 just make rockets, that drop and dont ignite an engine
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:50:05 lets add rocket drop first, and then consider bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:50:59 id say no to explosive blocks bc then ppl would make ___cide trucks
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:51:32 just u know, detach ur engines mid flight
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:22 oh god, ppl would also make su___de torpedoes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:48 thats why id say no to explosive blocks

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 06:00:41 personally i use dedicated turning engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 06:00:47 but u could use a rudder
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 06:01:21 or have two engines, both on separate keybinds so wen one is on it will turn but both are on its moves forwards

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 04:34:06 ima try folding it soon
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 04:34:32 i swear, all i want is the floating fortress rank, except its an invisible deck

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:48:15 wait a second, can cameras be used for trains.............. cuz since they turn invisible, hover trains?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:48:57 or you know, just a floating seat following the tracks

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:03:38 should i go on gimp and make a 1 pixel wide transparent line
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:04:26 wot
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:14:45 should i?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:14:51 look at the zoom btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:17:31 my 1x100 pixel transparent image
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:17:51 its still stransparent
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:18:24 look at the file name
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:18:40 im going to gimp and gonna try to scale it to 0.5 by 0.5
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:20:17 there we go
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:21:43 how to get 1x1 pixel images, go to ease of access, get the on screen magnifier, find it one pixel at a time
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:34:05 i think i broke it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:39:19 ***SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE TYPING***
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 23:01:54 hmmmmmmmmmm if i make a b17, put a flight deck on it, land it in the water with ballasts, and have two planes land on it, would it be considered a floating fortress?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 23:09:44 oof this ball spammer, ima get a pic of the name
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 23:11:08 gotcha
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 23:11:54 you can also make out the same name via this name plate

creations-chat 2019-01-01 23:33:18 all i did was search up concept spacecraft and built what looked cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:52:43 no its not, the number is still here ree
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:03:32 use alts

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 18:15:02 i had to make my 43rd alts rip
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 18:15:24 i think i build too much
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 18:15:45 although i only used 5 total players of filled save data
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 18:18:47 the other alts are for different purposes
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 18:28:02 go to the vip server youll see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 21:53:39 dont you hate it wen internet dies, goes back online and theres a message in ur inbox saying theres a maintenance for the internets in like a few minutes so it goes down immediately
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 00:22:14 did the vip server die
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 00:25:05 i mean, i try to land anything on a carrier, no matter how small said carrier is
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 00:25:45 i dont care if i have a carrier, ILL LAND IT
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:47:15 now try to make it have a perfect hover
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:48:12 oof, so im still ***kinda*** special
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:48:24 ye, without anchor
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:49:09 its not technically perfect but it goes up one pixel every few seconds (fully zoomed in)
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:49:32 ill show u it once im done with this thing im doing on my alt
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:49:46 im on the vip server point man posted in <#501059272675688468>
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:50:20 this is what im working on
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:50:39 the mobile launch platform with the detachable crawler transport
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:50:55 crawler doesnt move atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:53:23 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:53:42 now, i need to make be able to carry the MLP
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:59:12 ill show u mine later
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:00:47 would you consider this max speed accurate?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:02:10 o ok ill record a vid for you
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:41:07 o
creations-chat 2019-01-04 22:51:19 i forgot the first pic lol

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:52:54 ughhh thats done
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:53:54 *concealed wing panels*
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:54:24 i mean like put the wings inside half block wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:54:32 or soemthing
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 22:55:06 Scree im done with my damn MLP-1
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 23:01:55 scale shuttle with folding on this or no
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 23:02:35 it would have to be approx that high
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:42:16 why is this so annoying sometimes, but heres a progression image
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 00:48:27 <@!324566285155434497> its the buran with a mobile launch platform and crawler transport
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:27:56 BOTH
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:41:18 wen u gotta fold like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:41:49 no......*run*
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:42:29 i mean the orbiter is the buran but the launch platofrm is not the energyia
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:43:19 big oof, this folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:48:08 make a carrier, except ur assigned a segment
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:48:19 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:49:02 the first vip server is rly empty
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:50:53 i might do the tank like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:51:39 bc lord this is compact
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:56:49 x is the mounting point
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:56:54 also ima go eat
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:25:31 its coming along nicely
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:26:16 #weirdfolding
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:31:49 think the top of the fuel tank is too high?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:31:58 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:32:24 ill figure that out after i build it
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:32:42 the thing is, i never meant for it to fly in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:33:01 oh so basically RCS
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:33:32 so basically rcs
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:34:03 i mean, the nose of the shuttle has a build in rcs pod
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:35:40 linh in in the first one
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:53:50 ALMOST
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:05:22 now heres the thing if u look at reference photos, the launch clamp was never attached to the MLP
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:05:56 and the MLP and CT were separate vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:08:20 big oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:08:39 i couldnt make the energyia, cuz i was too lazy to find pics
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:09:09 the platform has the pipelines, and shuttle clamp also thats how blocky it is (ill do the indentations later)
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:10:51 i had this singular photograph to follow off of for the MLP
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:11:38 MLP
Mobile Launcher Platform
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:14:07 well, they're actual wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:16:50 and as you can see from the image (of a 3d model that i didnot make) the blast tunnels are not attached to the MLP
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:18:09 you want me to make a LUT (Launch Umbilical Tower) also?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:18:38 they werent on the shuttle launch platforms but they were on large single use rocket launch platforms
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 03:22:52 just build the tutorial plane, and make it more stubby
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:14:16 hey if it flies, it flies
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:15:09 now i try to make the damn orbiter controlable, and ik the cockpit looks more like a nose cone
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:31:23 now that i have a MLP and CT should i make a LUT for a SLS Rocket?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:33:30 what rocket should i make?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:40:13 big oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:41:02 the fi103r
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:41:23 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:41:26 sure?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:42:24 ***LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR AT BEST TO PARACHUTE***
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 19:43:23 ~~Wikipedia doesnt lie~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:06:23 it flies decently well
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:07:01 and yes the front it an explosive payload
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:07:38 specifically this portion
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:08:24 unless u go underneath the target
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:08:40 also the last one is more or less to kill me
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:11:48 look near the last few frames
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:11:58 youll see me
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:12:11 it was a failed attempt
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:12:30 ye
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:12:40 jhu is my alt
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:14:02 should i give the Fi103R a launch ramp?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:15:05 what are legos lol i never had a childhood
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:15:36 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:16:12 the only thing i played with back then was a screwdriver without a bit
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:24:27 the view of my manned v1
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:24:37 that crosshair is from shiftlock
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:39:12 someone should make a synchropter
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:39:59 this is a synchropter
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:40:17 two separeate intermeshed rotors
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:41:46 exactly, if the blades hit eachother, its not a true synchropter
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:42:58 well this will just confuse people oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:43:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:43:50 those are two rotors
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:44:05 they on the same level plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:44:16 well not rly but you get what i mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:44:18 same height
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:45:03 big oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:45:43 clearer image
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:46:08 yeah.....
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:48:00 well then
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:48:36 wait a second
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:50:23 1998: the Flying Grill's first flight
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 20:52:25 im making the grill first
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 21:43:54 why am i trna make the ka137 flying grill?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:58:25 the damn unfinsihed flying grill
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 23:59:33 the grill isnt finsiehd yet
creations-chat 2019-01-08 02:40:22 hmmmmm making a plane, made out of drop pods............ ill be back
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:31:32 what was the first robloxian powered (by walking) air vehicle?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:33:36 aight bet,
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:33:47 lemme record something ill be back
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:34:24 like, your not in the seat, and ur just walking forward but still airborne, without helium or engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:34:31 or flip
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:35:04 and ik gaining enough speed is possible because of my camera box
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:35:22 lemme just show u
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:38:17 this is a weird creation, because if u stand on the seat u go up, but if u walk, you accelerate rly fast
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:38:25 not the first time ive showed this
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:38:48 yet all it is, is just a box of camera
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:39:25 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:44:59 https://streamable.com/lj551
is it just me or is this entire creation broken?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:46:35 but that camera box is what i mean by robloxian powered flight by walking, something like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:49:27 which chair
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:52:15 noone still answered my question about what was the first robloxian powered aircraft (powered by walking, no helium, engines, etc, just walking. the camera box is an example of that)
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:53:22 no but rly, was there any robloxian powered aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:53:52 and ik this seems like a stupid question, but were camera engines made yet?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:08 bc i may or may not be trying to make a camera engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:45 no i mean, like an engine powered solely by cameras and a loose object
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:57 the camera box is an example of that as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:55:12 in which the robloxian is the loose object
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:55:22 ye that camera box
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:56:16 noone answers any of my questions........ welp, back to doing boolean algebra for majority vote project thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:57:16 literally all my alts owns a camera box =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:58:47 also linh believe it or not, farollo373 was my old steam account that doesnt exist anymore xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:59:24 it was wen i was using the keypad to type the 377 fast and i accidentally typed 373
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:00:03 but rly. has there been a robloxian powered aircraft?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:01:21 because if not, then i own one of the first RPA's with my box, although its literally just a camera box, not worthy of inventor and the thing is 100 blocks, so it wouldnt be considered one either
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:02:01 hey, if its voluntary its not that cruel. and i mean the creator powering it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:02:28 as for the slavery part, im not going to talk about that
creations-chat 2019-01-09 03:12:21 i just dont think the bot likes gifs
creations-chat 2019-01-09 03:12:48 bc ive done a gif one time, didnt send, but thats just what happened to me, idk
creations-chat 2019-01-09 03:14:51 well then. the bot doesnt like people rn
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:41:25 wen noone knows of the buran and energia ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:42:03 the russian space shuttle
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:44:47 hmmmm should i make this
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:06:51 i need to turn this box into a dropship =/ this is yet another alt ree
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:12:51 unsuspecting cargo crates
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:17:29 greenscreen container will now gain a energy shield
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:19:04 wen ur placement cursor has no green box it just looks weird to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:21:01 making energy fields is fun
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:21:54 i tried that one time, for my gunship, didnt work out well
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:24:01 more cameras! so imperial can make his 747 have an energy shield

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:04:47 im not gonna actually sit thru and make my finger hurt
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:04:58 4 minutes *
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:05:25 specifically an autoclicker that allows for key presses and works in background
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:05:50 i remember my old CIWS with autoclicker
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:06:11 it was before cylinders, or max torque. or pvp mode
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:06:43 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:08:19 explain how i get basically 1k ping from spawning in 1k cameras but my other 2k block creations doesnt raise ping
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:09:56 now add cameras
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:10:35 another layer?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:10:45 layer
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:10:54 ***LAYER***
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:11:11 im not that insane, so ur safe
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:11:41 or am i?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:12:10 after i place this, ima go to a vip server of a friend's
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:13:36 dont worry, im medically a pyromaniac
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:14:43 you think i was actually going to do that? this is my only pc i own
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:15:58 i need a new one but im running out of storage
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:16:38 i only got 500 more GB to spare and thats gonna fill up quickly with schoolwork
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:17:03 dont ask
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:17:14 i have too many multisim and solidworks files
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:17:46 ik, im talking about the amount of one) steam games and two)applications
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:19:06 wen u accidentally unplug the external hard drive
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:19:23 what server i want to know
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:19:50 uhhhhhhhh what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:20:32 idk why but now that i think about it, noone has rly ramed my weightless sphere thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:21:00 the sphere isnt complete yet so i cnat volunteer to be the ball yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:21:33 a little football game. except the ball doesnt care about gravity
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:23:31 ~~new soccer court here?~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:24:34 now to fill up with helium so it doesnt weight like a ton
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:24:52 im talking about greenscreen container camera box
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:26:11 use a 3x3 sphere
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:26:59 imperial, why u think im making a weightless giant ball? so i can be pushed around
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:28:58 i can move the 1k camera box 😄
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:40:39 how do you join, trace via avatar
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:08:54 id say to have helium, but not enough to make it start to float upwards
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:09:41 then the rest of the framework(usually for me) is made of configured ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:15:11 random question, are you sure the props are moving your craft upwards or downwards
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:16:01 basically, is it rotating the correct way
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:16:08 just wondering
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:41:26 how dare you build helicopter with TAIL ROTORS
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:42:12 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:43:08 and ik helicopters have tail rotors, but there are some NOTAR's
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:44:07 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:50:11 fine, ill try to make a helicopter without motors... wen i get home im at schol
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:51:03 hmmm making a swashpate without motors

plane-crazy 2019-01-10 02:26:33 like conjoining three of them together and seeing how it goes
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 03:58:43 idk why anymore but i wanna see someone make a typing test
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 04:00:11 define typing in ur case
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 04:03:06 scree time to make a 14 segment display
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 04:03:44 and 46 different keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 04:04:16 
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 04:05:39 no reason, i just wanna press any key on my keyboard and have the character appear (not doing shift for alternate characters cuz i dont know [or think] you can)
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 06:08:07 i tried making a paper plane but failed horribly. mainly cuz i couldnt figure how to throw it
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 06:15:24 the build box is 51x51 right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:31:00 places
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:36:35 folded pixel art launched to space xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:37:04 welp. people now know what im doing =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:39:29 wen i spawn literally anything that folds it becomes a tourist attraction. even if its just a damn straw
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:40:27 well the camera box explains the "hax" part
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:40:52 skree its GREY
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:41:20 its not TRANSPARENT
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:42:29 ima design the payload first
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:42:52 ~~even tho im supposed to type an essay rn bc im at school~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:43:24 wen ur school doesnt block discord
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:44:56 launching my weird drone that floats
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:45:32 does anyone remember that camera box that had like 1k cameras? launch it to orbit
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:45:50 not up, not down
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:45:59 not side to side, just stays there
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:46:09 no anchors
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:46:25 ~~stays there until u ram it(midair)~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:47:08 ~~still tryna find a way to factory reset a school chromebook so i can launch an OS on it~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:48:25 now put it in space
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:50:28 exactly, put it in space
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:51:45 or
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:51:47 use alts
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:51:58 more alts
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:52:09 like approx 43 more alts
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:55:21 random question: ariane 5 or energia?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:56:44 so this family? but the real question is. WHICH ONE
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 17:57:49 so basically the one that the buran space shuttle was supposed to be strapped onto
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:03:24 wait a second. for the space craft competition, could i have more tahn one launch vehicle (mostly identical) with different "weightless" payloads in which case they can be docked together to make a station
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:07:20 For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. (polyus on energia rocket) HMMM
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:09:51 *back

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:08:57 yeah, i dint try to make a decent payload
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:08:59 
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:09:12 thats why im not putting it in the contest, it looks pretty bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:12:50

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:14:03 thats the job of these props
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:15:14 i wasnt rly thinking of any rocket while i built this it just happened
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:17:48 i dont know why but i wanna make the srb's launch their own payload at mostly the same altitude and "dock" everything
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:23:21 what people see from the ground
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 04:23:57 you dont

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:07:17 new fairings
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:10:28 o**o**o Several People are typing...
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:15:10 idk why but i just wanna make a magnet launcher with impact explosives in it. then make it fly
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:18:45 idk if i still have the picture but there was a server i was in and if u didnt have a folding ship, noone talked to you
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:19:51 i would
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:19:55 but im at school
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:46:45 this is legit like the  only roblox game i play idk why
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 01:54:54 (this is my alt, yet naother one) ands thats a large payload <:thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:09:07 idk what i was trying to build tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 19:20:45 test 1
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:19:56 progress on one of my dropships =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:54:37 top view atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:01:13 i need to make it fly better =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:06:03 *wen ur dropship is faster than ur fighters*
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:37:27 what color scheme should i give this
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:38:28 so basically what ur saying is, make it a very visible target for anti air
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:39:11 it has no armament... its a dropship
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:40:11 oof but which one
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:40:53 i regret asking...
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:41:43 make the bottom blue and the top green xd, so wen AA sees you they dont see anything, if you land it looks like grass
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:51:45 well this is a first for me
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 00:52:20 me neither. should i type in my country's language randomly
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 01:18:09 wen ur flying around and you see a small periscope
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 01:18:53 and you go closer and you notice its a motor
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 02:43:07 wait a second, for the steam punk engineer for height control, you could have the main craft have a perfect hover (weightlessness if wanna call it that) and helium pods you can disconnect (wen u reach desired alt) to gain altitude
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:47:19 this is the second variation of my dropship (its just smaller and has differenct doors, thats about it)
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:47:23 
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:47:38 oh and its a VTOL
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:47:50 the doors
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:48:13 and the max speed
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:49:26 so remove the paint?
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:49:48 ill just change it to grey, like all my other crafts
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:50:00 not a variation of grey, just the normal grey
creations-chat 2019-01-13 02:53:59 that better?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 02:57:44 so i got my landing gear stuck in the hole and i cant take off, even tho im a vtol
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 02:59:27 so we'll assume that there was a splash bc the engines are elevated
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 02:59:38 also thats from below
creations-chat 2019-01-13 03:24:29 now thats the thing, it doesnt have one
creations-chat 2019-01-13 03:24:46 who said i needed one

plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:38:40 unless you know, ur used to it
bug-reports 2019-01-15 00:40:57 also they sometimes go horizontal and not vertical
bug-reports 2019-01-15 00:42:26 https://streamable.com/2sz0b
the horizontal variant
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:44:35 wen chrome stops responding bc u opened a new tab
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:46:32 wen the taskbar stopps responding bc u opened discord
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:49:00 wen roblox stops responding bc u tryied to fold in between two large boxes
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:54:10 look in wedges 2
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 00:55:14 
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 01:01:40 wen u dont know where to start the spearhead's propulsion and /or landing struts
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:38:22 i linked him it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:39:02 not the vip server the notoriety disc
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:39:38 also might i ask, who is deception?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:40:23 oh him
creations-chat 2019-01-15 02:41:14 wen noone calls it by it proper name
creations-chat 2019-01-15 02:41:23 ~~the energia~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:42:02 dont know, dont want to know
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:13:59 i mean, sure?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:14:35 thats the spearhead with landing strusts down and cargo bays open
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:16:35 im not even gonna question what im watching with the discord channels
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:17:01 currently yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:17:06 that you moved
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:23:38 should i have the spearhead carry military cargo in the form of volatile explosives?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:25:43 wen u gotta build ina cramed space cuz u want a working accelerator
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:29:02 the hardest part for me will be making the projectile
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:50:05 should i make the spearhead weightless xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:52:19 2d plane?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:52:58 oh wait thats game oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:53:15 it looks like a single layer from my plot =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:57:52 anyone need helium?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:04:19 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:04:31 i usually star off with the floor
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:09:51 xd ive done it bois
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:10:06 ive made the spearhead mostly weightless
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:10:44 just remember, use helium
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:10:59 ima remove some tho, i want it to fall rly slowly but not float
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:11:42 just took 3 layers of helum beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:12:21 now the harder part, making it a vtol
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:12:55 i mean, if u want to. but i dont like helium sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:13:13 in this case, i basically have to
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:13:28 i dont want like 1.5K super rockets to hold me up
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:17:26 wasnt that hard now that its rly light xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:27:35 i hate doing test flights
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:31:55 now i need cargo, a way to stabilize and the accelerator cannon that i might repurpose to RCS
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 04:41:38 i dont know why but i wanna get novice pilot with the spearhead but i cant because im still working on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:30:53 my teacher apparently doesnt work on anyday that ends in "y", except for those few days he has to
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:32:08 he also doesnt work on days that end on "w"
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:32:36 tomorro**w**
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:33:39 im just making sure people knows, he blatantly stated to all his classes, he doesnt work.
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:36:02 from what i recall, he only taught us electrical safety and how to use a variable power supply
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:36:26 this should move to offtopic so ima just shutup
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 05:39:12 kiwi wants to know why he has the big mute
general 2019-01-15 07:28:35 homework xd
general 2019-01-15 07:29:34 why is my teacher like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:36:36 uncolored goodyears blimp?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:36:56 ik
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:37:35 it just reminds me of the goodyears blimp for some reason, even tho ik its not one
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:38:19 xd pls no i dont need to see like 150000000000 f15's
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:39:13 just make a tutorial but wen it gets to the middle, just yeet a meme at them, never finish it
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:39:48 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:40:26 Aultismes sounds like a candy
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:41:24 skid: **s**ketchy **kid**?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:44:42 i see you got un big muted
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 01:45:07 wats happenning over here
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:07:36 the investigation on how deception got in the vip servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:07:43 is why they are locked atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:20:32 aaais this a decent speed for my freighter, it was still accelerating
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:21:32 xd ye the spearhead is indeed long
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:39:41 i dont know why i try anymore
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 02:44:07 tank controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:42:54 i have to start somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:46:28 i had to start the 16 segment display somehow
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:47:47 im not tryna achieve inventor i just want a 16 segment with 46 keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:49:02 have the balloon be weightless and then u have ejectable helium pods, wen u get to the alt u want, u eject the extra helium
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:49:35 which basically sums up height control for steampunk engineer
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:51:05 im prepared to have this piston chain be long, and yes thats the name JKA_Gamers1, which is another alt made for segment displays
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:53:03 you know, ill hate keybinding the display
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:54:11 why ill hate keybinding
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:56:44 this mess of pistons is only qwerty
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:57:03 16 segment display
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 04:57:27 
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:03:07 this is what i mean by 16 segment
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:03:10 and keybinding
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:03:36 *sigh*
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:04:15 ima end up keybinding 672 pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:05:09 im pretty sure someone made a 16 segment before so i wouldnt get inventor
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:05:45 5 displays? xd id need approx 2k pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:06:40 also itll be hard cuz if i pressed H, all 5 would appear as H, so id need more pistons that would appear with the keypad and lock the letter inplace before moving to the next one
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:07:22 XD inventor for the first 5 letter word you can change to whatever word thats 5 letters
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:08:02 xd 5 letters is all i can fit
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:09:03 id have to use the keypad for the locking mechanism bc im making 46 combinations, which include numbers and special characters
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:09:44 this is what digital electronics does to people
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:11:35 itll be done in approx 1-2 months cuz school exists
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:24:46 ah shoot i just realized, how am i gonna use half pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:31:32 top row of keys have been completed (qwertyuiop)
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:48:38 moc all i have to say to that is 0.9x1 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:49:46 wen u forget the anchors
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:57:30 boi im about to do the letter H
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:57:36 on the 16 segment
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:58:10 random names from other games before i found PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:58:42 and JKA_Gamers (the real one on steam) is the steam of my DE teacher lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 05:58:53 thats how i found out about segment displays
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:04:08 i have decided im not going to do []\;',./ because i need more normal pistons and if i dont include those i will wost likely be able to have 3 complete displays
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:06:53 xd already used 178 pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:07:18 all i need is 1234567890zxcvbnm
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:07:43 progress
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:09:04 well, i am making 36 characters per display
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:09:35 done with 19 characters
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:12:46 approx length of each display
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:13:43 this however is NOT a true 16 segment bc DP (the period after every display) is not present
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:17:50 xd its so wobbly
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 06:21:20 ill prolly have stability ropes or disconnectors to ease it up, then release it
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 07:35:39 im pretty sure they have, vip servers are on lockdown atm im pretty sure (after the deception incident)
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 07:39:08 any suggestions on how to stop a line of 42 pistons to stop wobbling (cannot use 1x0.9's for stability due to size restraints)?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 07:44:43 returns the motor to its original position, although, i never found that it works wen lock is enabled
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 08:43:05 wen u wish there was a block like this but dont want to submit it to suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 08:58:09 boredom has taken over
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 00:13:42 hello from school
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:02:17 xd?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:21:58 you know what ill hate rn
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:22:17 taking a pic of every single letter i have on the 16 segment
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:22:43 cuz reasons
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:25:23 also its rly hard to see the Q
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:25:48 and if u cant see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:27:17 249 piston required for ONE 16 seg display
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:28:13 479 blocks for the basic segments and filling gaps
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:28:49 overall with cover 1079 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:28:57 and this is ON purpose in general chat
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:30:24 someone give me a letter, ill take a pic of it. (and itll take a while cuz friction and piston chain is wobbly)
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:31:21 last segment is slidin out slowly
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:31:48 xd the piston chain detonated cuz glitches
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:36:12 excuse me for amoment ima try to fix the damn letters dropping down
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:41:35 wen u need stability
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:49:45 can you see the h?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:50:15 i guarantee you its there its just rly finicky
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 02:58:36 the lighting setup for this was a pain, can you see the H now?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:00:23 you do realize how hard it it to do lighting wen 1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm is already keybinded?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:01:28 numpad is taken too
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:01:52 i dont trust those bc of the Fn Key
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:02:41 no, just lights
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:02:48 bc i need 16 lights
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:02:57 also anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:03:08 also wen u extend it all out
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:03:59 as i said, i dont trust the F keys
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:04:18 why i need supports
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:04:50 wen u extend all 46 16 segment letter/number keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:05:34 and i KNow theres an easier way but this is a MK1
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:05:48 mk2 soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:06:10 whatever is the most effective, im using for the 5 letter-16segment display word
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:07:47 mk2 will only use 16 pistons (80 for a 5 letter word) instead on 249 pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:21:31 its just like boolean simplificationa ll over again, except this time its lesser pistons instead of lesser letters
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:34:39 i said, for the third time, i dont trust the F keys
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:35:12 most of those are lighting and anchors
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:36:20 bc theres a FN key i have and all the F keys are comboed with FN, besides, i use the FN key ALOT
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:46:09 imperial, while this deign for the 16 segment is more effective, im still doing the 1500 piston design too
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:46:12 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:47:37 imperial ill see if i can fit in 5 more to spell that out
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:48:51 definitely can
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:59:28 xd first person to make any 10 letter interchangable word(s) without needing to delete or place blocks than original creation. but ill ask for other things later with the mk1 16 segment display
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 03:59:36 soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:13:31 the mk2 keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:16:56 numpad keybinds for switching letters
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:22:30 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:22:53 original pic without enchancements
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:23:44 proof i didnt just hightlight random things
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:26:46 5x 16 segment mk2 displays
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:27:24 big letter thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:27:54 awesome what 5 letter word do you want me to spell out
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:28:03 still working on the top rows
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:28:15 tops rows of another 5
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:28:53 if i had both sets or 5x 16 segs, id do furry admin
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:32:10 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:32:26 still doing coloring
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:33:20 id need the top row (not completed)
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:33:40 hmmmmm, maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:33:58 imperial, make it fly, fold it, and make a sentence
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:34:04 xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:34:10 first customizable sentence
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:34:27 not yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:34:45 im not even done with the second row xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:35:51 multiple pics xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:36:52 learning the alphabet in PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:44:40 is that clearer?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:45:46 *sees hole in left wing but not hole in right wing bc you dont have a right wing*
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:55:49 imperial, that clearer?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:56:54 the system is just before switching characters, a panel drops down to stop it from being changed, and to help see it better
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:58:18 keybinds for that
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:59:40 why is there a category called wake me up inside
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:31:23 wen u find a random block below the surface
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:39:42 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:40:12 ur just hallucinating
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:53:54 different angle (taken before future joined im pretty sure)
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:54:36 oof sry =/
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:54:53 the lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:55:27 wen u get 5 seconds of normal frames then it dies again
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:56:20 xd lol roblox gonna crash
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:56:38 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:56:40 still am
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:57:00 all i see
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:57:21 ima attempt to rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:58:04 game, whats a random person avatar thats not urs
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:58:47 its called tracing the server again
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:59:15 ik that much
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:59:39 ye'
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:00:11 didnt need it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:00:22 i traced it as the last server with 8 players
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:01:09 nah, its called that one pic i had that was my frozen screen
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:01:18 there were 9 players, subtract me thats 8
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:04:26 yeah i cant be in that game my frames go from 60 to 5
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:04:38 xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:19:14 the 16seg mk1 was rly long, the mk 2 you couldnt see, the mk3 you have a backboard in prep of folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:20:17 mk4 would prolly be wen it has the folding, mk 5 is prolly gonna have more aesthetics
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:21:07 mk6 will prolly be mobilization for advertising
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:21:31 dont know yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:21:58 you think 9 is a real number?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:22:24 its a wannabe
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:23:58 HERES ANOTHER ONE
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:24:45 i swear to god that damn hull has been spotted by my around 17 times
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:30:28 wen someone doesnt believe that you have a functional 16 segment so they give you the word FLEKP
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:30:42 i did it and he proceeded to crash me
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:23:42 thats last night
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:59:49 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 00:30:48 i atill dont understand why people dont do this

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:08:02 starting the other half of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:09:34 imperial, is u very sure that noone had made a 16 segment before
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:12:27 i just realized, if anyone needs a picture of their creation, and they want the name of it in the picture frame too, i can just drive up to them
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:21:38 is it illegal to spawn this in, bc every time i do, this is as far as i get
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:22:21 bc every where else, if i spawn i crash
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:23:02 bc for some reason, i spawn in the ground, also i unlocked every anchor block i have, no results
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:23:13 pushing one piston, will freeze my game
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:23:36 i have anchor blocks, so yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:24:06 imperial, if i did that, id kill me PC AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 03:26:38 one layer works fine

plane-crazy 2019-01-21 00:51:59 one that doesnt use shift
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 01:15:07 idk why but it produces lift even wen theres no engines producing upwards lift and its just control panels (non functional control panels)
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 01:15:35 as for that, thats roll
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 01:17:16 random question, does this look like it would contain weapons?

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:27:43 so i was bored
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:28:18 i crashed cuz russia and jumps can sometimes mix well

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:21:34 o no

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:27:55 someone called my BMD a BTR D=
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:28:35 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:28:52 lemme just go build a BTR and see if they call it a BMD
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:29:11 ok nvm they left
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:30:26 but which BTR
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:38:00 its a necessity for imperial now
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:39:19 you have been chosen
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:40:12 smol
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:41:27 which tank we talking about
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:42:45 3 mods on phone, 3 mods on pc
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:43:12 3 mods phone, 2 pc
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:45:04 1+1 = 1
assuming A is 1 and A' is 0
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:45:52 <@!362351190618538005> its my homework
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:46:03 its boolean algebra laws
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:47:41 did you guys know 1 is equal to 1?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:52:50 infiltrating
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:55:23 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:04:52 im having a DM war bc someone is tryna convince me america doesnt have orange space suits
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:05:21 its the shuttle reentry suit
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:05:36 im not talking about EVA
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:06:53 or the launch entry suits
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:07:50 those work too
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:21:16 i dont see a different from the BMD and the BRDM at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:21:43 BMD is on the right
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:24:57 those turrets are oddly similar tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:29:57 ima work on airlifting it so i can put it on a carrier or an oil rig or someplace
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:34:16 decent enough for me
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:34:29 
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:36:44 now what russian lift helicopter to make
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:37:06 thats not the mi26
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:37:27 or the mi10
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:38:39 ka32?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:43:06 im not tryna make another attack heli
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:43:19 im doing the civilian version of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:43:43 it waws built as a heavy lift helicopter but then guns came along
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:48:22 apparently we're not doing the KA, just a helicopter my mind comes up with
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:59:26 wen u misalign it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:00:08 duck bill, it reminds me of
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:00:53 Solidworks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:01:09 ah, looks similar to solidworks
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:02:13 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:02:35 those flares are awfully close to the blades
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:03:20 looks like plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:04:14 and awfully misaligned airlift heli
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:04:18 im too mazy to move it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:05:01 it started its life as a KA32, now its whatever my mind takes me
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:06:14 less misaligned
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:07:18 ree ima have to resort to hjku and arrows
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:13:35 sure
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:13:43 flying is gonna be a pain
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:16:08 surprisingly, it isnt that imbalanced
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:16:24 still is imbalanced
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:16:29 just not that much
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:17:48 youd expect it to be front heavy
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:19:34 gotta get used to flying from the tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:20:00 bc im in the tank, and im tryna fly a helicopter thats above my normal flying view
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:20:06 also i swing around
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:20:11 even wen retracted
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:23:09 who NEEDS gun pods
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:24:39 how can people fly like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:27:52 imagine if i had to
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:28:52 ye
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:29:24 *looks down*
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:31:04 down prolly isnt an options, considering the controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:36:04 wen u press g wen taking a pic
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:37:03 pic before the drop
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:40:42 got it to fly
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:40:44 now i need turning
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:40:52 also, yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:41:20 the heli, is controled with numpad and hkju
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:41:35 wsadqefrzxmn is tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:41:49 look closely
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:41:52 its not attached
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:42:07 
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:43:25 bc i prefer the look of the guns
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:43:54 also wen i tried the half wedge, the tank glitched
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:44:11 like the gun was inside the tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:44:27 somewhat, yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:45:33 i prefer the look of the airborne IFV than the heli, but then again, thats the main point
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:46:03 for future reference, down arrow, then 4 for the blades
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:46:19 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:48:03 once i deploy, i just leave the heli there xd, cuz it cant fly without the wright of the tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:48:23 or just crash it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:49:08 oof i joined ur game
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:15:46 o no
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:17:02 its prepping to jump
creations-chat 2019-01-23 06:18:51 i remember the days wen u would drop a bunch of blocks above people
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:20:53 wait a second, now that i can airlift the tank, i can place one at the sea
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:21:08 i dont have to drive there and flip anymore
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:21:26 also the thing hates going uphill
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:21:47 the slightest incline will move you from 45 to 7
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:22:18 its hanging from a stand, did someone catch it
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:22:34 o no

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:36:29 why does it look like they deployed from that
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:37:33 it went to a watering hole, and now its drinking that nice soil
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:38:17 and that soil was ***ON POINT*** so it didnt need to fly anymore
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:38:40 what am i typing lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:43:32 got back on to test the helimachopper, and it CAN fly without the tank
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:46:19 i was just using my normal keybinds to fly
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:52:01 first person flying isnt so bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:52:10 even if all u see is a small slot

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:11:48 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:16:59 i wonder how people work
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:22:50 depends what ur looking for
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:22:54 and what software u have
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:24:01 i usually use grabcad for inventor and solidworks. sometimes blender
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:25:51 G4M, give a model u want to use for reference, so i can see if grabcad has it
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:26:49 ok then, software then?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:29:08 i mean, if u can open STEP/IGES files, u could use grabcad. no guarantees tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:30:11 for example, need a pavelow?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:30:12 https://grabcad.com/library/sikorsky-mh-53-pavelow-1
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:35:20 need a b1?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 03:35:56 i sound like an advertiser
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:38:27 color 1 or color 2?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:39:27 color 1: drab olive
color 2: whats on my tank rn
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 04:40:51 also the  heli's view

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 01:39:10 so i might as well request for the rank here Rank: Lightspeed
Done using no helium but 50 speed motors and the blades facing the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 02:03:51 i live that nice curve at the tip
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 02:03:54 top

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:02:30 how is it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:03:05 the coaxial rotor is there until i figure out my tail rotor
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:13:40 tats why i use hibernate and not sleep cuz you can only hit either sleep hibernate or lock
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:19:25 it somewhat works, i just stops rotating it to take a pic
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:20:01 i will, but wen i get it to fly without toggle
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:21:27 reasons
creations-chat 2019-01-25 03:42:15 wen ur heli control are wayy too sensitive for your liking
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:44:07 vip1 is empty ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:44:09 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 03:47:15 i almost got it but look at how steep those tail rotors are
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:08:50 i can tell why people think we either collabed or followed a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:09:39 the olive is me, the black is wofd
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:10:20 look at the similarities

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:11:15 he has two for all 3 motors, i have 3 for all 3, i have fixed landing struts, he has wheels etc
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:39:52 i want to make the aigaion
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 04:39:59 from AC6
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:17:12 i hate making aigiaons
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:35:24 this is a rly bad represent of the aigaion
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:35:56 
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:36:12 i havent done the fining yet, im still doing the builing
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:39:45 this is why i dont build massive flying carriers
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:49:30 i dont care if its blocky anymore but i hate building this but i want to continue
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:50:13 thats the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:51:14 itll be dark grey later
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:55:39 i hate my life
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:55:43 the wings are wrong
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 05:56:49 except they dont have a head
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:04:48 reasons
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:05:21 its about to get another fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:05:38 cuz the wings aint done
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:06:03 
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:08:28 rftgyhuj is all folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:09:45 
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 06:10:45 fly

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:28:31 hello from ap world history
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:43:57 i swear, wen me and wofd are in the same server, people are gonna ask for the tutorial link bc our helicopters look VERY similar. but then again most attack helicopters are similar in design
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:44:58 i mean, just look (old pic from yesterday), should i change anything to make it different?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:45:35 also, i love my rotor
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:48:55 thicc heli, go look at my ch53
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:50:37 i just need to conceal my main rotor more, and remove the coax
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:52:43 walmart

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:55:07 C
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:55:34 C. Both Choices Apply
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:55:43 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:59:20 if the insides is hollow, you could hide propeller blades

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:27:20 ik but i still want to roll easier bc i prefer rolling and pitching than yaw
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:27:41 and who said i made it big enogh to land?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:28:12 and currently at the pace it rols, i can use it for fine adjustments
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:37:11 so this is why i dont turn xd, that arrow is where im flying
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:38:27 decent amount of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:38:30 mostly beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:43:13 long way across
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:43:43 not that long, only 3 plots
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:44:28 if u can fly thru, gg
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:44:41 should just put tutorial planes there

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:45:58 anchor
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:44 bc im not done
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:02 the hangar?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:21 about 10 block, if u count the wedges
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:36 u gotta fly thru it to fire a missile into the core
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:46 thats was AC6 mission 9
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:48:09 i think i was 9

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:56:09 ye
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:56:32 each engine pod has 8 engines like the real thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:57:18 the thing requires 10 kc10s to refuel and still has to lower its altitude
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:57:55 not to mention the task force that can be launched and the 24 flak guns on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:58:12 usually escorted by 2 gyges class carriers

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:55:54 3 fps 😄
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:56:57 that fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:57:11 0.18
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:57:34

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:59:58 what u expect at 0.02 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:01:02 0.0 could be simplified from 0.02
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:23:55 im sure u can guess what im doing
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:26:03 xd i guess u can call this strigon team xd

creations-chat 2019-01-26 04:39:20 make multiple compact them, and yeet them all out a cargo plane
creations-chat 2019-01-26 04:39:57 you could load it in via a rod with the compacts
creations-chat 2019-01-26 04:46:31 sounds alot like my old drop pods xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:40:10 i was trying to do that for lightspeed, succeeded 4 times with a heli, didnt get a rank xd. at least i dont think i did, still have the pic in clipboard manager, it was taken 2 seconds before i died
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:41:55 found it, 2 seconds until death
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:42:05 o wait thats the wrong one xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:42:09 i did four tests
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:42:20 trierd at four times xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:42:24 ill try a fifth time
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:43:04 i just need to remove the coax to make it commit lightspeed
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:56:49 had to ake another alt xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:58:12 im sure u can guess
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:58:48 does that door design look familiar to you?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:59:17 doors thats very similar to clone LA/AT's
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 23:19:50 what i have rn
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 23:20:18 yes, doors work
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 23:20:37 LAAT, Clone Gunship

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 01:55:08 front guns complete, now i need the ball turrets
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 01:55:14 coloring comes after

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:47:11 the rail gun wen u fire it, you lag alot, but you cant see teh round exit the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:47:48 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:48:14 u only know wen if fires if u dont see a orange cylinder in the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:48:25 anti lag doesnt do anything for 36 magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:50:12 then again the entire barrel is made of magnets basically
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 02:50:20 to make sure it leaves the barrel

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:55:41 decreased magnet count from 104 to 4, also has a SR to propel further
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:56:16 not flak, just undersized rail guns
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:56:26 ***UNDERSIZED***

creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:08:02 oof i read it wrong The New Block count is 2497, the old one (with 104 magnets is 2500)
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:09:17 and in case your wondering, this is the top details
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:10:10 The Two images i based it on are as follows
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:10:17 
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:11:41 oh you can hold down space? that makes it alot easier
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:12:06 easier than spamming v and space over and over again
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:12:17 v is my ragdoll keybind
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:14:09 wait a second, they were considered electromagnetic cannons by usea oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:17:17 rip, twas gonna make the arsenal bird's props to be able to feather but apparently, they dont
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:18:56 oof i gotta make these but rly small
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:24:14 reminds me alot of the MQ101 HMMM
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:26:28 idk why i want to go into a game, take out toe stone henge and slowly say the lyrics of ace combat 6's chandelier ost
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:29:01 take a pic of his deck, put it on ms paint, color picker it and look at the rgb in the color menu

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:31:02 which one to make
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:51:14 jesus what is this in game lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:22:06 i hate keybinding engines for uav facilities
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:23:56 should i stay with a flight of 35 drones or a flight of 140
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:28:13 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:18:59 im not who i stole this drone from but its to show that you can glitch into third person camera on non manned vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:19:46 
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:20:47 im not sure, i stole it from someone here but ik its light enough just to use keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:25:19 xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:25:33 do these 7 drones count as 1 plane or 7?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:27:31 well it stalls at this altitude
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:28:48 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:29:23 i should make the most amount of drones and try to land as many as i can on g4m3's carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:29:45 bc they're pretty small
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:29:56 swarm em
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:30:08 oh no not that
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:47:27 we about to swarm people soon

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:32:55 just a cockpit of a fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:33:34 thats why i made it in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:34:35 the left has a lighter borderline than the right
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:36:27 this look better or worse?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:37:07 there was no other side at the time of that pic
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:37:43 basically this or this
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:37:46 
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:37:52 
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:38:46 if ur wondering what im doing
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:38:59 just a concept fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:39:13 for now yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:40:09 from what ive found out, guns align here
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:40:24 if placed on the smae level as the seat
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:46:40 this is the closesnt thing i can get without using wing lights
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:47:42 might try pistons tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:48:49 might use this
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:53:00 yes but how would i replicate such thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:53:51 xd. its a half wedge down of glass
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:53:57 thats what makes the sides
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:55:55 in that one space right here?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:59:37 cuz reasons
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:01:20 its....... suffice
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:01:51 xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:05:44 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:06:33 i cant do that for mine bc building reasons
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:08:55 this is it from the outside
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:09:18 im not basing off of anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:09:25 just a jumble of concepts
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:10:43 i might use gunpods of the wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:11:41 yeah, it looks weird sometimes in first person
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:53:27 front view atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:53:44 coloring comes later
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 05:44:24 yea that much is obvious due to the green
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 05:44:48 ok back to being afk for another 50 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 01:57:33 225 just went concorde status
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 03:31:12 progress so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 08:03:26 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 08:04:18 are you just mistaking the pre registered mouse controls?
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 08:04:29 or am i missing something
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 05:51:14 now heres the thng
i dont watch yt but i just sub for no particular reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 05:51:46 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 18:04:53 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 18:05:14 them wheels tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:28:29 my railgun IS the projectile
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:28:43 winter wheels
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:29:10 like wdym?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:29:58 bc theres the normal wheels that use smooth plastic texture and theres winter wheels that use the roblox fabric texture
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:30:32 looks alot like winter wheel textures tbh =/
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:32:53 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:35:25 theres also something called making 30 missiles, sink them in the water and just launch them wen u find a prey
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:37:52 ye, helium rope, and tnt
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:38:09 now make explosive barrage balloons
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:39:15 i mean then again the missiles i make only have 2 explosives on each
creations-chat 2019-02-01 17:39:28 places
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:40:06 ill have to remake my underwater missile launch site
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:40:38 i used to use them as target practice drones before explosive blocks were in game
general 2019-02-01 17:56:55 wen ur playing geoguessr and this is what u see
general 2019-02-01 18:04:35 it was in washington dc
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:24:28 now i need to make it fly... properly
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:24:45 nah
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:25:09 tbh, i didnt base it off anything
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:25:37 i just built whatever came to the top of my head for "fighters"
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:38:28 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:38:57 literally never heard of that aircraft james =/
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:39:19 but i can see the similarities
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:40:51 except i have a tailfin
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:41:23 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 21:45:42 ran out of space..... for the 17th time. time for another alt
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 22:47:54 still tryna figure out how that would work
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 22:48:54 well then
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 22:50:31 i can see how everything else works but i cant comprehend the cockpit folding/extension, but thats prolly cuz im missing a few brain cells from that fold
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:09:34 so i found the server and decided to use this old, ugle thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:11:45 made one rq =/
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:11:55 just bc i launched
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:12:24 and there goes another =/.............
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:15:06 ok back to my other alt to make a catastrophe of a uboat
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:16:07 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 23:19:23 dont you just love off center holes
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:21:15 Ultrasurf. the one application that ive seen that effectively keeps the school firewall inactive so then i can get blocked apps like steam and roblox. if the usb is still in the pc.
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:22:21 ye
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:22:32 doesnt work all the time, but it works
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:23:11 i mean, wen its running i can connect to game servers
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:23:58 but if the computer is being monitored (like the host pc can see the screens of the other pc's) it commits die
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:27:29 what i have atm....... this is my first. and most likely my last sub
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:28:02 all three
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 01:29:04 i just realized its already 1.3k blocks..... and i havent gone into functionality yet

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 01:25:57 g4m3, if i was trying to trigger people, id use vertical 90 degree piston magnet folding
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 01:32:59 using the pistons to push it into place and magnets to weld it in place
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 01:41:35 seems about right

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:17:01 ye im doing that but im also making the bolt
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:18:17 btw it fires 1x3 caseless
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:20:40 its only 400 blocks per magazine
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:20:52 and one motor
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:20:56 and 2 magnets
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:18 https://streamable.com/xybol
battle ship, this is basically what im putting the drum mag into
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:37 thats the older pan magazine
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:24:44 i only loaded 1 round tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:25:58 G4m3 are you alive currently
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:26:15 bc you kinda just said my name and stopped moving
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:26:19 in game
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:37:31 its rly inefficient. its only 17 rounds
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:37:38 and it hates being upright
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:39:10 welp time to make the gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:39:41 bc i havent figured out automatics yet, ima try using my semi auto
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:48:45 reeeeeeeee
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:17:07 FINALLY
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:17:22 its the basicas rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:19:10 so it decided to like me rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:19:16 and load in a round
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:23:29 i just have this glass here in case of jamming inside the clip
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:23:47 it happens but its rare
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:24:25 my pc dies every time i spawn it and im too broke to get a new pc
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:24:30 i can reset jams
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:24:54 so i can see if its the ammunition or the slider thats jamming it
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:25:27 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:25:30 not rly
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:25:44 slider jams i use the magnet to reset it
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:25:51 the ammo jam i can just move the slider
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:26:43 thats the slider
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:26:48 the slanted bit
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:28:23 the point of this is the push the round into the camber, and keep every other round in the clip/drum
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:29:04 i dont care about speeeeling mostaikes
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:29:52 i said clip/drum bc i use both
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:30:25 ree its a caseless cartridge holder
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:31:36 i call it that cuz noone seems to know what a magazine is in roblox servers these days
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:31:57 but when i say clip for some reason they know what it means
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:32:56 how about i just call it a gun with cartridges
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:34:44 in cambodia, "the plate" refers to the thousands of landmines in our forests
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:35:19 even tho im in cali
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:35:31 we only removed about 15% of all the landmines
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:35:41 they still active
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:35:51 all 450,000 of them
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:35:55 estimate
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:36:12 blame the vietnam war
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:36:45 oh and most of them are reported to be anti tank mines set to the weight of a well fed german shepard
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:37:07 also g4, its not just one forest
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:37:11 its all the forests
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:38:20 the combined forces of ~~both~~ mostly the US, and not so much of the vietcong
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:39:15 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:39:24 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:40:02 ***HMMM***
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:41:03 revolvers have 17 rounds, is fed thru a cartridge dispenser, and have a bolt, seems about right
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:42:04 so uhhhhhh, the pusher round fell out (the one that pushes all the rest of the rounds out)
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:43:20 so i decided to shove 4 rounds in the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:47:27 *i tried 5 rounds but the 5th yeeted my gun into the abyss*
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:47:33 i was anchored
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 05:49:04 wen ur on an alt account but the only vehicle you have is a nonfunctional (for now) uboat, every thing else is part of a gun
the-dump 2019-02-13 05:59:30 hmm
the-dump 2019-02-13 06:00:08 how about
the-dump 2019-02-13 06:00:11 no
general 2019-02-13 06:03:10 but g4 why didnt you get rid of chrome, edge, firefox, i-explorer, safari, roblox, discord, and system 32?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:05:28 AH SHOOT

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:05:56 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:11:47 uhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:11:52 that just happened
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:12:35 i fired 7 rounds, and someone rq's or leaves idk, bc i actually fired the rounds
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:12:45 and loaded them
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:22:24 bc im that kind of person, you can eject the drum after usage
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:38:24 Builder/Lag Specialist Ranks (Build a creation able to travel on land, sea or air. Requirements for surface based creations are doubled.)
Master | 1000+ blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:39:13 just show a pic of the save thing with the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:39:21 and ask for the rank
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:40:03 im not a mod, i cant do much
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:40:18 aka the save
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:40:47 you still need proof of block count for the rank =/
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:45:29 ive seen four types of people with ranks 
1.people who are determined to get most of the ranks
2.people who build and occasionally ask for a rank
3.people who build but dont officially post anything (in <#384025409945337856> )
4.people who just dont care but still post them
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:49:01 im like number 3
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:49:28 there
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:49:49 now the message has been edited to include numbers
the-dump 2019-02-13 06:51:42 seems about right
general 2019-02-13 06:54:39 so i searched up "uranium" and wikipedia appears with Plutonium 236
general 2019-02-13 06:55:03 welcome to using bing for an entire day
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 06:55:20 uhhhhhhhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:40:50 who said i cant change controls
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:41:16 so in theory i can have it as f
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:42:39 abdcfejhigklnmoqprtsuvwxzy
you know how about i just edit my message up here yousuf
in that way, my message slowly gets longer and yet i can talk without being the victim of "below" messages
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:47:13 but ill admit it im a noob at skyrim
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:49:44 lets see, the last time i played skyrim was about 11 months ago, and that was the intro and then i ran out of space for solidworks to update
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 07:50:11 and i need solidworks to model things in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 08:54:20 i turn on my disc status and apparently roblox is still running
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 08:54:44 ree
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:12:27 iS tHaT dUsT II bOmB sItE a?/?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:17:04 has anyone remembered playing on dust 1?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:18:39 ah, so im alone in the group who played dust 1 csgo
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:19:03 mine couldnt either
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:19:22 forced it to run csgo at 5 fps
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:19:42 surprisingly i got decent playing at 5fps
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:19:52 which is why i dont care about Plane Crazy frame drops
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 10:20:10 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:20:21 then uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:20:25 things happen
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 01:54:54 ima take a break from PC bc a power line just fell on our car, shaved a door clean off
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 01:56:29 please note, power lines are known to cut straight the frame of small cars
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:09:25 keybinded control surfaces can be used as prop blades jako
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:11:41 i want to get on pc rn but ima wait like another 30 min bc of the powerline door incident
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:12:44 in the mean time, ill just create ideas for pc
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:23:03 so i got bored of planning ideas so i made this THING
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:23:35 its like coaxial helicopters but its odder
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:24:00 not gonna lie, it works
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:28:15 and to stop rotation you need 5 rotors, for some odd reason
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:51:32 hmmmm, the bottom rotor oddly stops counter rotation
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:53:24 correction, it doesnt stop it
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:53:30 it stops rotation
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:53:36 not counter rotation
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:54:06 so now i have an odd 3 rotor helicopter thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 02:56:01 so some guy tried to flex at my with his turret...... i fired one round bc i was testing loading, he left...... why do people do this to me
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 03:35:35 hm
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 04:46:30 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 04:46:36 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 04:46:48 ***HMMMM***
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:41:32 i failed alot xd, its just the sights for my cylindrical cartridge holder and ejector also known as a gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:43:13 and cuz of cartridge loading problems i sadly cannot eject the mag
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:09 i dont care much about terminology
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:20 sometimes i do
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:25 sometimes i dont
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:29 depends on the day
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:41 so far
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:48:41 also it looks like shit
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:51:09 to the barrel of a ppsh 41? i noticed, not what i had in mind at first
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:56:59 but then again compared the the 41, that barrel is SHORT
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 05:57:38 thats like seeing the 41, with the barrel cut off there
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 06:41:18 its so BAD, but at least it pushes the round from the mag into the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 06:41:48 why do i even bother
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 06:45:45 ***GIVES PPSH A PISTOL GRIP BUT NOT A STOCK***
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 06:45:50 xd no
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 06:54:14 *doesnt have trigger*
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 23:54:27 4. Fall Up
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 23:56:08 4. Die Quickly
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 23:58:45 i mean Nicholas Alkemade survived falling 18k feet without a parachute
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 23:59:28 oh, he fell on tree branches
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:01:00 5. Alt F4
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:01:39 3. DOnt breathe
general 2019-02-15 00:03:33 if u google image search that picture you get "pc game"
general 2019-02-15 00:03:48 
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:39:45 hehe
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:43:13 why do i even bother playing anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:56:30 i mean i dont use tnt for the propellant but i do have to push the round into the firing chamber to actaully fire it
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:16 hmmmm now i figure out how to make a damn calico magazine
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:08:34 OOF

plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:09:31 im just saying i prefer to be in smaller servers, but im too lazy to magrate servers
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:27:19 what should i make with this
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:27:27 hovers remarkably well
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:28:54 i originally just wanted to see if i could make a 5 rotor coaxial that worked
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:32:07 just why are five rotor coax's good at hovering?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 03:38:08 the formation of the solar system is in progress

plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:07:54 thats the front view, i made it almost as if it were a strike fighter

plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:10:22 i dont make aircraft with guns to pvp, i make them just bc i want to xd

plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:15:26 i just noticed how much that aircraft is =/ also thats the name of one of my earlier aircraft that looks VERY similar
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:15:50 it was the RF-56 Pleaides but this is the RF-60
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:16:16 dont ask what RF means, just something i made a LONG time ago
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:18:24 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:19:51 jameson, so i decided to search up concept aircraft to see what i could make and i found an aircraft that looks VERY similar to the Pleaides.... and no, i found this AFTER i made the pleaides
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:19:55 https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/concept-aircraft-1

plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:55:33 it uses a gear to push it ree
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:02:03 with the help of magnets and an extra gear (thats the keep the empty mag moving even wen it gets past the first gear) it got out completely, but its only that far away cuz the magnets

plane-crazy 2019-02-18 04:47:28 this rly isnt even a plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:06:36 now with escort drones
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:21:49 i was bored so i added another pair of escort drones
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:25:43 i might add a squad leader for the drones
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:27:04 its under development and i refuse the take it out if theres people in the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:27:21 bc its 6 different mags
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:27:38 no.... not until im done
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:28:06 wdym? its 6 different ways to make stripper mags
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:30:04 also theres not much of an interior to the freighter lol.... its the cockpit (cramped) and the cargo lift.... nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:30:46 i might make the cargo lift for troop deployment
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:33:14 dont need ur escort? use them as flares
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 05:54:30 uhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:02:57 thats from his c-2 post
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:08:41 long barrels are SOMETIMES a problem
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:08:46 and im not the one making the gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:10:52 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:16:05 is this cramped enough?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:16:11 for a cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:37:24 so i just watched int rq cuz of water spawns
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:42:28 just a minor leak
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:42:59 just a MINOR leak
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:43:25 just need a bit of flex seal
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:43:32 we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:44:07 bc no matter waht you try, it refuses to sink
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:48:06 you forgot the crew xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 07:00:51 im just gonna back away slowly
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 07:02:10 uhhhhhh...

plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:14:07 i clicked the link and chrome is now taking 90% of my disk
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:15:00 i use chrome bc theres literally no other browser on my pc... even microsoft edge doesnt exist
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:15:25 theres an internet explorer but its a shortcut to a folder
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:15:34 and that folder is empty
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:17:06 i mean, im currently running windows but i can load up bootcamp and go to macosx if i wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:18:33 in the year 3000 some of us will still be here, but they're all dead
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:25:38 and this generation is dead
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:28:28 but mercury wouldnt survive
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:37:53 i guess you could use this as a way to chamber bullets
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:38:14 the top one acts as the slider, the bottom one actually pushes the rounds in
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:45:15 this is what i resort to ..... airbrakes bc this thing is so damn fast
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:55:18 im really considering if this cramped THING is good enough for a light freighter lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:58:05 does that mean planes from boeing cant have midair collisions either?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:58:29 i can, but its in deveopment
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 19:59:10 havent decided. just a bolt for now bc im currently editing a space craft and not doing gun mechanics
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 20:00:03 someone should build a tree and wen fall comes, detach a bunch of wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 20:03:31 how? thats a 56 hour build
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 20:03:54 also i dont vote in creations..... most of the time

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:24:11 hmmmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:24:21 i should remake my torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:02:53 Several people are typing...
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:03:26 can it fly without its wings?
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:03:55 just use ww2 tech then
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:03:58 ww1*
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:04:34 in that case, ill ***back away ~~quickly~~ slowly***
creations-chat 2019-02-19 23:15:52 not me...... although im currently making a LAAT/c
creations-chat 2019-02-19 23:16:37 im just gonna make it carry a box for now
creations-chat 2019-02-19 23:16:46 until i finish my own atte
creations-chat 2019-02-19 23:16:56 cant rn, im at school
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 23:22:20 im in chemistry in the apwh kahoot
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:47:53 uhhhh what if the military bases that were attacked created enough noise that the aliens could identify each target with ease, thus having the military mistaking the alien using sight rather than sound
this is directed for congtrolligceator
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:49:54 thats not the answer, thats just what came up in my head
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:50:12 back to dealing with IC Chips
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:50:42 ye, Integrated Circuit Chips on CDS Programs
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:51:01 Circuit Design Systems
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:51:31 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:51:46 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 01:51:57 for 13 minutes currently
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:40:42 o no, not this argument again.......... im just gonna back out of this slowly as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:03:42 right
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:09:05 disregard this message, its for me to reference from so i dont have to change discord servers to look at this and to talk
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:09:23 blame me tryna make drum mags
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:09:32 and?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:09:46 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:10:17 now how the hell am i going to make this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:15:56 integex, ur gonna cause anothe LANDING incident with that kaga of yours 
 (as in this wen i say "landing incident" ) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/537012860006432768/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:16:33 i actually want to see that again tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:18:23 g4m3, if you and integex can somehow get the two carriers in the game, we have extended landing space for more LARGER aircraft
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:19:16 another landing thing soon ? *am hopeful but ehh it might happen, it might not*
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:20:02 go to general if u wawnna see what i meant by landing thing
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:20:12 it was wen g4 finsihed HIS carrier
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:21:31 didnt he use motor folding from under the deck to get his bridge deployed?
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:23:02 ok
creations-chat 2019-02-21 03:23:20 expect a landing from wither the Liset or the RF900 Escort Flight

is all ill say for now, if i can even GET the liset done soon
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:30:44 minecraft for an hour currently
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:32:46 longest i played minecraft? 16 hours, i tried to make overly complicated piston things
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:33:31 oof, i was on ps4
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 03:43:04 ***F***
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:08:09 i hate making curvatures like this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:09:31 this is my attempt at the warframe Liset landing craft (the starter one) which makes me hate my building abilities
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:10:03 like....... makes me hate it ALOT
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:10:40 very easy to fail indeed
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:10:53 and i already did
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:24:25 Cancer wedges
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:25:00 it looks better in person
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:25:05 still cancerous tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:33:51 i swear this GOD DAMN HULL
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:34:08 ree its already 680 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:34:26 its so BAD
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:35:59 i still need the back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:36:02 and the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:36:56 at least it looks good from up here
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:36:59 decent not good
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:39:34 and from the pictures, the antennae is the same length as the body so ima do more folding and motor work
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:44:12 uhhhhhhhh any mod watching chat rn?..... or anyone for that matter?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:45:37 bc this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:46:16 was watching creations chat
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:46:22 wen i saw it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 04:50:37 If anyone needs the pic again i have it in my clipboard manager
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:14:25 guess ill just wait until a mod sees it (it as in this)
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:17:51 you know, why does roblox let you set your birthday to the current date
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:19:31 hmmmm, if ur account gets compromised, just set ur birthdate to the current date, and make them suffer
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:20:06 bc if ur above 13 u can change ur bday, if ur below, you cant. therefore, they have to wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:35:59 sure
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:36:29 i mean, i tried to make it as life sized
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:37:02 just so you know, it has 2 propellers bottom of track one on each side to turn
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:37:19 4 props to move forwards
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:37:23 2 to move backwards
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:37:35 and 4 blocks of helium if im not mistaken
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:37:50 helium isnt necessary
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:38:02 sadly no
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:38:48 then again, its 2.5 blocks in height, not including the fake track
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:39:05 correction
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:39:11 2.5 with the fake track
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:39:27 i might be able to show more tmw but im doing hw rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:40:01 xd so im not the only one in pst
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:40:52 damn, i have to deal with AOI circuit to NAND IC conversion
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:40:58 2 hours at minimum
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:41:29 prolly will sleep at 2 and wake up at 5
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:41:48 school is an hour away, extra hour to do chores
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:42:36 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:42:47 technically its personal chores
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:43:07 damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:43:32 gotta deal with that DUST that collects on the breaboard so the fuses dont DIE
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:44:53 if ur future highschool doesnt have college PLTW engineering courses, you definitely wont know
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:45:27 Project LEad The Way, basically STEM engineering
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:46:06 oof then you might encounter digital electronics
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:46:27 good luck with the equation 1+1 = 1
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:47:05 bc power cant have values over 1 unless you're overcharging it, therefore ur power source stays at 1
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:47:33 discrete mathematics that use binary only
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:47:36 is worse
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:47:48 also known as Boolean Algebra
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:48:08 which gets easier wen u learn Karnaugh mapping
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:48:29 K-Map for short
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:48:44 in which to simplify A'+B and B'+C'
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:49:26 which is equal to A'+C'
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:49:46 bc B' and B are opposites of each otehr, they cancel out
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:51:56 it gets worse from there
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:52:33 you know whats gae
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:52:36 converting this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:52:39 
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:52:43 to this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:53:52 you think you have it bad?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:53:58 this is offtopic now isnt it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:54:18 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:55:47 for tht cicuit you saw up there
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:55:58 this is the ONLY thing we had to go off of
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:55:59 The original design of the fireplace control circuit was quite simple. For the gas valve to
remain on, all four sensors needed to output a logic (1). During field testing it was discovered
that variations in gas pressure and humidity cause the thermal sensors to occasionally output
a logic (0) even when a flame was present. This caused frequent unnecessary shut downs
and constant customer dissatisfaction. For the redesign, it has been determined that the emergency cut-off value should remain open as long as three of the four sensors indicate that a flame is present.
Additionally, the designers have asked you to add a second output indicator to the control
circuit. This indicator will output a logic (1) when the four sensors do not all agree (i.e., not all
on or not all off). This indicator will be used by the service technician to diagnose whether a
faulty sensor exists.
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:56:08 no pictures
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:56:12 nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:56:26 digital electronics
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:56:53 like, how the hell am i going to get a circuit from THIS diagram
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:57:42 datasheets make we want to stop DE
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:57:52 me*
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:58:46 then i assuming you know CDS software issues
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:58:54 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 08:59:05 we had to make a traffic light and i didnt like it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:00:04 ah yes, scripting is MUCH easier than using ur hands to strip wires wile the power is running
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:00:12 while*
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:01:04 yeah, that sums up the traffic light project
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:01:17 we had to deal with 530 different LED lights
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:01:24 individually controlled
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:01:48 which is a pain bc ur tryna make a trafic light state your name and birthday
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:02:37 i cant code ree... i can 3d model but i cant code
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:03:05 Autodesk Inventor
SOlidworks
Blender
CATIA
etc
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:04:12 ye its 1:03
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:04:42 i hate my life, i found the folder i though i deleted
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:05:30 i was never taught blender and i still hate it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:06:31 im assuming you know whatr this is for, this is the CAD system i grew up with. i cant do shit in Roblox Studio so i have to import
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:07:52 https://solidworks.virtualtester.com/
you can go pay the like $150 test fee to go get that certificate ~~70% fail~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:08:17 at least im an intern at BOEING now
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:08:36 i have the internship ONLY bc of the CSWA
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:09:47 and to prove thats not a fake certificate
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:10:55 i want my refund
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:11:09 they be selling the CSWA for $70 rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:11:17 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:11:36 i want my $5 back bc the school paid for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:12:52 ah shoot ill be back J-476B just overheated
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:13:18 im like half back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:13:35 J476B is my breadboard
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:13:46 no pls
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:13:55 leave my breadboard alone
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:14:49 this is basically (very similar) my breadboard
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:15:06 now stop tryna take my bread
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:15:58 how could this happen to me
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:16:36 ima just shutup and deal with my DE HW
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:19:43 O1005
N1 G91 G28 X2 Y5 Z0
N2 T03 M02
N3 G23
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:19:47 ah shoot
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:19:51 wrong application
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:20:01 dont mind that
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:20:38 youll learn about CNC mills later, thats all you need to know
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:25:24 for VIP, tank controls are set to yhgj for turret movement Keypad: 14 for left track 25 for right track 36 for ATGM . to fire ATGM
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:26:06 airlifted variant has controls set to wsad for movemtn qe for left and right rf for up and down
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:26:14 o ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:26:40 what about the airlift vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:27:02 the aircraft in which it carries the dropped payload
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:27:58 just use that for all of them tanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:28:20 thats what i did wen i had a airdrop swarm
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:28:37 o damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:29:29 so im not the only one with v as anchor
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:29:42 why do people use B
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:30:24 damn, i use zx for roll
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:30:53 people with kill me for this, i use e for pitch up q for pitch down
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:31:11 yaw is ad, thrust is ws
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:31:51 hmmm now i recall if i have ever used shift and ctrl
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:32:09 numbers are easier for me
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:32:18 alt is ragdoll for me
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:32:32 m is parachute
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:32:54 oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:33:17 why would you
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:33:41 i mean i use \ for the nexus command bar, but thats only for !fps
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:34:23 and now i say gn bc of circuitry
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:34:48 ping me tmw after 4:00PM PST if u have questions on my tank/BMD
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:36:04 ah yes, the damn thing gets over the hill at the beach with EASE
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:36:11 the cliff face
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:36:30 but the damn thing hates hills
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:36:44 it can climb a cliff but not the hills/mounds
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:37:12 i want to see how youll compact it in that tiny thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:38:06 the most compact parachut completely takes up a cross in chape
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:38:08 shape
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:38:11 ive made
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:38:19 not  in the game, that ive made
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:38:50 i dont release my chutes so the public can steal them
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:39:27 lets just say its just a dedicated airbrake pod that you can fly back to base wen u dropped ur target
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:39:56 basically ye
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:40:03 a drone parachute thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:41:05 the bmd with the helium needs two of those drones to drop it, but thats understandable bc each airbrake pod has 4 1x4 wings and 1 single 1x1
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:42:00 uhhhhhhh what?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:42:41 i mean....... imagine the top view of a quad copter except the engines are in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:43:10 sortof?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:43:50 flower with 4 petals that hasnt bloomed completely yet

theres a nice reference for the body for you
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:51:39 best turning propellers
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 09:54:27 me neither
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:45:38 id get on a game' but im at school reeee
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:46:07 i should reset my school schromebook..... should i?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:47:17 yes
creations-chat 2019-02-21 22:00:56 it reminds me of bomber crew
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:50:32 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:51:38 thats age counter seems a bit odd
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:37:56 this is some great way to crsh and burn
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:00:00 starting on the back of this damn thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:20:11 its ***an*** carrier
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:20:48 im almost done with this ridiculous top curve
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:46:26 cancer tail
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:54:51 WHAT EVEN IS THIS
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:55:10 it looks like the liset but its doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:00:42 obviously yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:08:55 stonehenge as in the EML?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:09:32 ElectroMagneticLauncher
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:10:47 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:10:52 basically a railgun
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:11:32 ***stonehenge***

OLD picture
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:15:01 i prefer making models..... bc then i have an excuse to use Solidworks
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:15:51 CAD software
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:16:07 Computer Assisted Design Software
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:16:12 aka 3d modelling
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:16:32 expensive to run tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:17:18 my turret? my rly old turret that i never see or use anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:18:13 i use solidworks to help me by having a reference source 
yes it costs money, but thats bc boeing and aerospace comanies use it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:18:25 alot of companies use it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:18:29 i got it for free
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 01:18:34 ***dab***

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:56:11 wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:56:22 wat color did you use for the hull
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:56:30 and color picker isnt helpful
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:57:06 bc of the shades of lighting
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:57:38 looks alot like 104,102,82 tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:57:43 although a bit darker
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:58:11 so maybe 94,92,72

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:14:00 6 times my RF900 light freighter with drone support
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:14:12 but then again, that thing is smol for a light freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 02:37:19 did i get pinged?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:33:10 ah yes, that vehicle

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:34:35 never fire the turmpanzer wen climbing a cliff
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:34:58 bc you wont be climbing anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:35:13 youd be there asking for a towrope

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:37:35 ah yes, its clear again
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:38:50 HMMMMM
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:39:19 "They are simply snow-blowers and jet-dryers used at some Russian airports, like the ones shown below - with Klimov VK-1 engines taken from MiG-15 " HMMMMM
the-dump 2019-02-23 06:40:44 i searched up jet engine this is what appears
the-dump 2019-02-23 06:40:50 why

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:44:20 best tank to ever be =made
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:44:34 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:44:44 its russian tractor tanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:46:28 what i see people building in PC
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:48:20 int, can you bring me a sample too
creations-chat 2019-02-23 06:49:35 *looks at plane*

*looks at ju52*

hmmm
creations-chat 2019-02-23 06:49:56 not like i could make a decent plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:55:18 ree ghost pongs
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:56:57 i just realized, i never got my sub commander rank for this
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:57:36 im dont care much about ranks, i just prefer it
creations-chat 2019-02-23 07:09:25 my skyguard defensive platform 4? its ***decent***
creations-chat 2019-02-23 07:09:46 and the LAAT/i? it cant fly with my piloting skills
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 07:15:49 i remember this xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 07:15:59 it was like 1200 cameras
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 07:16:14 correction 890
the-dump 2019-02-23 07:25:20 yes i dont know why i posted it
general 2019-02-24 02:55:23 i regret tryna learn the warframe corpus spoken language
general 2019-02-24 02:55:43 tf is a corframe lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 03:43:25 i will now join the people with the big detailed ships, but not have a convention ship rather have a corpus cantilever cargo ship
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:06:46 time for smaller details of the front
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:08:38 ofc, i dont have high res pictures to go off of
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:08:50 bc this is normally in the background
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:09:56 light freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:10:27 corpus cantilever class light freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:10:46 thats the community name of it
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 05:11:10 this thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:25:38 when you are medically blind without ur glasses
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:25:56 #20/200_vision
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:29:08 ~~ur not alone~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:29:44 i dont exist
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:32:23 wen u close roblox via task manager. but then it crashes
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:36:55 wen u gotta make the interior upside down
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:55:34 that moment wen this segment is only 1200 blocks... and you still havent done the large cargo tanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 19:43:41 the freighter is not a vtol (the dark grey one and no anchors on mine)
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 19:44:02 it just has alot of helium
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 19:44:29 was it kip xd?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 19:49:12 yield, idk why my drones are heavier than the freighter, thats why wen i landed, i ejected them
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:21:51 oof wofd is idle
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:23:45 also plave a seat half embedded in the ground, and sit in it, just to see if u have parts under the map
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:48:50 time to start the cargo containment, bridge and engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:06:32 if u couldnt see with the yellow construction boxes
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:07:42 there isnt much to see on the outside rn, bc ive been working on interior

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:08:59 old pic
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:09:04 line is where im at
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:09:34 ill just LOVE doing the cylindrical cargo tanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:09:49 twice
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:10:10 ima just end up using motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:10:45 im doing basic shape then details later
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:11:57 the boxes are merely just guides
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:14:08 ima have to remake my boxes
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:14:37 to compensate for the cargo tanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:17:36 cant rn, bc hw issues
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:18:02 besides, half my box doesnt exist anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:18:50 brb then
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:18:58 i guess i can get a quick photo
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:21:16 
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:22:15 and bc ima get screamed at for age and my username
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:28:10 o no
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:28:47 new drop pod block leaked xd?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:29:18 its ROPES
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:31:19 decals
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 06:31:33 ok im logging off
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 01:58:23 a tram? (or trolley if u wanna call it that)
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:36:25 i got the bridge segment MOSTLY done on the freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:37:02 from here on out its gonna get alot chunkier
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:56:16 my pc is dying from 3k blocks alone xd... time to degrade my 8 bars of graphics
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 04:06:00 the first cargo tanks are attached
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 04:06:32 and ima go afk
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 04:56:43 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 05:33:58 i swear, half blocks are my savior wen it comes to making a undetailed surface "detailed"
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 00:50:23 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:17:39 got te second tank done
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:19:04 how much is one block in meters?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:19:21 bc the cantilever is 600 meters long
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:20:18 say a robloxian was 2 meters tall approx, this would be about 1/4 scale
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:20:44 5'11; 2 meters, close enough
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:22:00 thats a different way to use disconnectors than i normally see =/
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:22:45 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:23:07 ye idek his name or havent seen him before
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:23:28 minecraft ship building almost
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:25:23 isnt it like 51x51x idk height
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:27:34 i hate making the cargo tanks like this
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:27:46 just 9?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:27:51 46 alts
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:27:56 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:36:21 now i go on discord to wait for my fps to stabilize
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:42:19 REE IM AT 4K BLOCKS ALREADY also i just noticed caps lock was on
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:43:44 how the hell am i gonna pus landing gear on this
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:43:51 put*
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:44:12 idk yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:44:26 the cantilever class was never shown landed/grounded
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:44:40 and dont say inside, im making the interior
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:44:59 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:46:36 but its not dark xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:49:13 i m on this segment and theres another cargo tank and 6 engines ree
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:50:44 my frames lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:50:52 im at 0.023 fps
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:51:01 bc i spawned
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:51:12 wen u got shitty pc's
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:52:39 wen u realize the size of the cantilever (the middle one is the one im making)
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:17:55 after i finish my corpus freighter, should i make a propaganda poster for it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:18:05 ~~wrtten in corpus~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:22:34 and g4m3, i want landing gear cuz carrier landings
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:47 did someone mention lag?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:13 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:17 its called alt tab
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:10 i prefer 3d modles
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:12 models
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:36 then use extensive searching for 3d models..... but then again its biased in my favor bc i have paid 3d modelling software that costs about $140 but the school pays for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:46:00 if i find a model of any of those two ill let yall know
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:50:05 im assuming curly means CV5 and not CV10 for the yorktown
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:55:11 note for future people, if you see someone in the server named RedFireIndustries, dont tell people to try to land on your carrier, ill most likely attempt to use the cantilever or my other rly bad at flying transport ship
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:56:44 so land this thing on the carrier deck
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:56:49 gotcha
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:58:11 oh shoot
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:58:14 wrong pic
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:58:26 that was corpus writing
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:58:28 sry
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:28:53 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:25:05 i USED to be in vip 1
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:29:48 time to make myself for the engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:48:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:48:40 sorry i have a cantilever out
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:54:25 think this is long enough?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:55:17 the fat dark grey ship isnt heavy tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:00:25 hmmmmm if i filled all this up (currently hollow) and landed it on someone's carrier, you think it could support it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:09 should that freighter be a bit longer or no bc i can squeeze abit more length into it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:43 what is 5000 blocks rated at. no helium
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:03:45 by the time i get the cantilever to fly i approximate itll be about 6500 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:06:40 battleship, what if u launched the anchor UP
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:06:57 ~~and retracted it~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:34:19 my engines ate all my half wedges
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:34:37 and i need one more engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:35:14 the engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:37:11 600 half wedges dedicated to the engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:37:48 899 for internal details and exterior details
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:38:05 also i only have 500 normal blocks left xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:38:29 5.2k blocks, not close to being done
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:38:32 as i said
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:38:42 i estimate about 6.5k wen i get it to fly
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:39:18 no, the corpus propaganda poster will be made
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:40:11 hey, you think the servers can withstand 3 corpus freighters and maybe some escort fighters?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:40:32 use 0.9 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:40:44 or move it down one
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:41:30 or make it a stretched out octagon so you have one layer of wedge, 2 layers of block, 1 layer of wedge
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:41:56 it depends
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:42:40 and what im making, just picture this with this engine config
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:42:44 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:43:12 oh and i need one more cargo tank
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:43:22 and one more engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:43:54 what am i trying to achieve? nothing. i just wanna make a propaganda poster
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:44:11 no u
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:45:00 isnt it supposed to be the back not welded
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:46:06 think ill get pinned if i post it to creations chat xd
also i might not even POST it in creations chat
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:46:26 ill put up a poll wen i get to it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:48:30 test 1 dont mind the picture
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:50:26 thats expected
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:50:40 i was testing my inet connection
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:50:58 and u prolly cant read it cuz its written in corpus
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:51:15 Join The Corpus!
Help Fellow Colonists Today!
is what it translates to
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:59:26 if yall wondering if i ran out of space yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:00:08 and current progress
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:00:19 now ill go do my hw
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:04:54 im on the final stretches for ***basic shape*** details come afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:07:01 gimme a moment
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:07:27 bc i need to join a server
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:08:20 now i wait for lag to subside
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:09:35 its 5k blocks, ofc ill lag
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:10:52 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:11:51 ye its widest area (not including tanks) is 11 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:11:56 most of it is 7 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:15:15 now
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:15:21 whats a good way to make this fly
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:15:28 with as little helium as i can use
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:16:30 ill face a problem with that
theres an interior
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:16:58 yes, burn the crew members
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:17:07 if it flies it flies
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:17:12 who said we needed crew
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:18:52 who said we needed computers either
we only need an anchor block and alot of engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:19:04 add alot of lag to that list
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:19:16 i meant for the picture
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:20:07 but will it hover fine if its slightly tilted to the left
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:20:45 thats why i need the anchor block for the propaganda poster xd
~~and i need 3 more freighters~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:21:01 ~~maybe some escorts~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:21:10 ~~and server death~~
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:21:36 are they corpus technology?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:23:46 god damn corpus interceptors
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:25:22 i might use these later on
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:35:16 wait, how long is the flight deck of the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:36:26 damn, i cant fit the cantilever on it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:36:31 ill damn try tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:36:48 ik
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:36:55 the cantilever cant fly yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:37:04 so i couldnt if i wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:37:19 (the cantilever is the freighter if u needed to know)
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:37:28 warframe
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:37:54 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:38:28 just started playing last week
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:38:36 on ps4
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:39:03 i like the ships in it more than anything else, it gives a challenge for me
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:39:49 mainly bc of the curvatures on the ships
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:41:35 ehh
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:41:38 i dont mind it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:42:44 and wen i say curvatures im refering to spheres, energy orbs,, etc
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:42:52 search up warframe corpus ships
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:42:56 or just corpus ships
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:44:19 ye
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:44:33 i still need another cargo tank
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:48:38 no, its not
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:48:54 thats a corpus supension field
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:50:01 these are engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:50:29 why do you think there are no bigger ones in teh other viewpoint
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:51:26 ehh, personally i dont rly care if its an engine or a cargo tank
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:51:37 as long as i get the basic shape
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:51:41 im mostly happy
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:15:38 ropes make this happen xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:33:09 ughhh, it might take more than 6500 blocks to make it fly bc i just got 500 blocks just for the engine details
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:33:15 at the details are miniscule
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:39:33 concerns for the people in my server
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:50:51 starting the engine cover
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:52:49 when i say smaller details

plane-crazy 2019-03-01 03:53:17 (details of the non accessable engine room)

plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:42:40 basically
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:42:58 convert head smash into keyboard gibberish into numbers and letters
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:43:08 in 2 hours
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:43:10 by hand
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:43:28 except someone smahsed their head into a keyboard for about 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:44:36 bc i gotta do base64 -> binary -> ascii -> decimal -> octal -> hexidecimal
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:45:00 id rather be on PC, but this is a project grade
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:45:44 and CIM is Computer Integrated Manufacturing im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:45:50 idk what that means
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:50:45 SHIT
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:50:49 i did it wrong
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:50:53 its ascii to binary
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:50:58 REEEE
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:51:48 no i can do my work and talk at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:52:04 but why
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:52:28 uhhhhhhh its something that happens
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:53:12 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:53:18 have fun with DE then
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:53:33 POE and IED is lit tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:53:57 CIM is supposedly cancer
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:55:12 POE teaches the basics of things like aerodynamics, thermodynamics, etc
IED teaches you 3d design
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:55:54 DE is circuits
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:56:02 CIM is coding i think and circuits
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:56:13 i forgot the 12th grade one
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:57:58 omfg, this damn teacher makes us decode a youtube like on how to decode it
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:58:01 i wanna die
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:58:16 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 04:58:21 im decoding for hw
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:00:05 as in decode i mean convert the following into ascii
the following is an example
SGVsbG8sIHRoaXMgaXMgYSBhdXRvbWF0ZWQgbWVzc2FnZQ==
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:01:05 SGVsbG8sIHRoaXMgaXMgYSBhdXRvbWF0ZWQgbWVzc2FnZQ==
converts to Hello, this is an automated message
and then convert to binary
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:01:11 and etc
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:01:12 etc
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:01:42 its not even comp science
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:01:46 its circuitry
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:02:16 but
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:02:19 hello is SGVsbG8=
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:03:03 bc the computer needed to read input in a 64 bit space (thats what the text book said)
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:03:32 tbh, me niether
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:03:34 neither
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:03:54 protoboarding
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:04:15 we do this, so we can convert it into circuits and make the computer do that
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:05:37 and if i dont do this, i cant go to physics day (the school's excuse to make people go to amusement parks to "find answers" to questions noone answers)
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:06:29 anyways, ill be back ima go ask for an extension
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:07:08 well then
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:07:19 68 other people have asked for an extension
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:14:43 now do yo see why im still trying to make a input 16 seg?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:15:40 as in i press a key, one in game actually presses, and the key appears, while only using 16 pistons for the 16 seg and 10 pistons for the inputs
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:16:06 how would i accomplish this? 
sensors and third party sources
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:18:42 quick thing about IED, vip, they use SOLIDWORKS and HATE people who use blender and autodesk series, for reasons idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:18:59 at least, t hat was my school
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:21:29 trig is cancer
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:21:39 ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:22:01 math youll do later on
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:22:32 then again im in 10th grade, trig is a 11th grade course
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:22:52 they placed me in the wrong class xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:22:59 and they refused to move me
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:23:11 im supposed to be in algebra 2
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:23:17 xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:23:34 nah 11th grade is hell
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:24:07 correction, 10 and 11th grades
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:24:19 colleges dont pay attention to 9th or 12th
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:24:59 9th is just hey, did you improve in 10th?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:25:16 yes and?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:25:47 oof trig is a requirement for most colleges
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:26:43 im in the engineering pathway =/
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:27:03 aeronuatical/aerospace
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:27:39 ok ill cyall in a bit ima go EAT A TANGERINE and shower
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:27:52 u2
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:51:00 HMmmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:51:25 im doing hw due midnight sry
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 05:57:38 *memories of attacking capitol ships intensifies*
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:14:01 reee
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:50:08 did i hear dodecahedron?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:50:15 here xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:51:19 just make an inverse rhombicosidodecahedron
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:51:39 also known as
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:51:43 a nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:52:00 aka this thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:52:58 actually lemme see what i HAVE made
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:53:31 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:53:40 ive made a rhombic hexecontahedron
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:54:03 https://grabcad.com/library/rhombic-hexecontahedron-1
my upload of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:54:18 its also where i get a majority of my 3d models
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:54:26 bc they usually have it
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:54:37 ~~even if it uses iges/step~~
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:55:40 a small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron was also made
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:55:46 i should try to make em in PC
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:55:48 xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:56:00 and call it some sorta energy core in PC
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 06:56:30 or make any kind of antiprism
general 2019-03-05 06:57:19 should i??
general 2019-03-05 07:24:57 how to fold furthest flying world record paper plane be like

plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:59:02 it depends on what ur replicating
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:37:22 has anyone attempted the habakkuk aircraft carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:37:52 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:25:11 i was bored
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:25:19 and yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:25:22 it does dhoot
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:27:13 yeet
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:27:23 idc
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:27:50 they dont even look like 50 cals xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:28:09 they look like you put 20 mm repeaters on a quadmount
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:29:11 uhhhhhhhh
i dont build aircraft or ships xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:30:03 how about
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:30:04 both
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:30:18 cuz i cant teach for shit and i got DE to worry about

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:15:26 oh wait thats the power line
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:15:42 ehh, rip my neighbor's power
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:16:36 rickje is here
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:18:00 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:18:29 wen roblox refuses to close
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:18:47 was lock on?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:19:06 hmm. pistons work fine without lock.... for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:20:49 im supposed to be doing chem rn but WHATEVER
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:22:06 
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:22:40 sometimes it does for me, most of the time it doesnt. but thats me
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:23:09 you know ive supported my FREIGHTER with 2 right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:23:18 no helium
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:23:30 5.6k approx bc no more interior
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:23:41 but i didnt use lock
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:24:09 piston lock is useless to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:25:00 like sticky pistons ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:25:32 theres something called metal and insulation
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:25:53 so basically NAND GATES
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:26:36 dec, just use motor chain on lock
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:27:11 it still happens tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:28:42 200 wen im on at night

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:32:06 *liking illegal things*
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:35:19 o no i see dec in game
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:36:16 i am now currently pointing that ugly quad 20 at him
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:44:10 you know perfectly who got a tank stuck on ur build by accident
and i know im happy, not as in drunk, but mostly happy

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:46:47 fig
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 08:42:08 im so damn tired but i  need to do hw
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 16:59:39 why is people talking about boolean rules now?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 17:49:45 just drop them on the nearest populated airbase
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 17:50:06 specifically in front of a taxiing civilian aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:19:52 ILikeTerrains, wasnt that a nuclear device dropped from a AI controlled bomber in the animation?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:20:37 it dropped 4 i think
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:21:18 ehh, powerful cluster munitions, same thing (not rly)
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:49:29 commit wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:50:25 ***exactly***
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:51:34 why does it look like thomas has pink eye
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:52:03 no wonder hes so happy
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:52:21 ima commit do hw
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:53:21 its 11 pm on 3/6/19
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:53:25 cya
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:53:43 = X'
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:55:48 im more worried about why the cursor is aligned with the arrow
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:55:53 part of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:56:31 nah its just a normal cessna 105
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:56:59 thats got some pixels
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:57:37 just run
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:22:47 hey, id it works, it works
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:22:52 if*
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:23:35 its thicc tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:24:29 problem 2. im not going off of a picture so idk wtf im making
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:25:36 i dunno, maybe it could a british naval aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:27:10 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:36:50 i have the wings, but i dont know how the hell ima build a body cuz i got no pics
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:13:08 wen u got folding problems
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:14:28 as i said
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:14:32 IDK WHAT IM BUILDING
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:14:46 i got no reference pics
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:15:16 i originally wanted to make a fairey barracuda but it went down hill from there
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:15:31 bc i dont make surface aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:41:03 it flies
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:41:27 side note: wen wings are folded ofc it doesnt fly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:42:51 folded wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:46:02 why does it remind me of a cessna172 wen its folded
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:06:59 i added worlds shittiest torp
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:42:28 ILikeTerrains, i mean, i can force my ppsh to do that
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:42:51 then again, the ppsh doesnt care what angle it is to load a round
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:43:08 unless ur magazine explodes randomly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:48:34 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:48:47 its 9:48, pm, time to start my hw
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:48:53 agian
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 06:20:51 104,102,82 work fine for ur intenions?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 06:23:54 that ones basically olive drab
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 06:24:08 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:06:10 hmmmm. not enough runway for my torpedo bomber in that state
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:06:40 OOF\
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:07:50 *making turrets in 1x1x4 areas*
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:08:06 ok ima off to school
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 00:46:00 nah its FINE
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 00:47:25 i think so too cuz now all i see is this
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 00:49:50 step one of making motor tracks
get unpowered motors
step 2: dont make them touch each other
step 3: use blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 00:51:08 i wanna find a carrier to land on now
and just fold the wings, just to see if flight then folding does anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 00:59:13 *wen a moderation bot goes down on one of ur servers so you have 567 pings so u outright mute the server's at eryones*
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:36:33 a fuel boom?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:37:10 then again, the fuel boom needs a receiver rod.... hhmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:39:21 just go commit biplane fueling
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:40:36 REE its called a reception coupling
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:41:13 i search up aircraft refueling and i find this
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:42:52 from what i saw ye it did
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:42:59 but idk about anyone else
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:45:45 **lunch lines**
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:46:08 that'd be cool to do... but laggy
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:47:55 i dont see why you'd want to do this, unless its for stunts (and it is)
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:49:43 i meant like moving from plane after plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 01:50:09 like you fuel a plane, but that plane is fueling another
creations-chat 2019-03-09 02:01:15 just wait about 2 minutes, if its still not responding close it, bc thats what i do
the-dump 2019-03-09 02:06:29 when people spam spawn units
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:59:53 the distance from touching down, to coming to a full stop
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:51:48 rate this wing fold out of 10 bc im just currious how people view it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:53:24 side note the wing fold brings the plane from 19 blocks width to 7 blocks width
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:53:53 im on a vip server =/
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:54:02 so i have no lag whatsoever
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 05:11:31 why is this trppy to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 06:03:07 reasons
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 06:07:55 
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 06:18:46 ik its that glitch, but still
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 06:19:05 *i had a bomb armed in both occassions*
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:27:23 reee the new physics makes my plane too light again, so i need to find all the damn helium deposits
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:56:27 hmm smoke trails.... now people can see my torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:05:28 i changed my bomb, i didnt like my first one
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:06:07 my plane is now a true torpedo bomber
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:06:39 the one that i didnt have reference pics and i made its wings fold in a different way
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:07:05 this thingh
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:07:37 its a carrier based torpedo bomber had no refernce pics tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:07:52 the propellers was cuz the damn physics broke my plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:08:07 as in it made it too light
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:09:55 i was at the vip server 1 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:11:05 i should make the hellcat now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:23:44 fuel? i have no space for fuel bc the majority of my plane's blocks are wedges, 0.9 blocks, glass, helium, and or wings/engines
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:25:08 im pretty sure its having 2 other people land on the carrier
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:25:15 pretty sure
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:25:23 not 100% but more like 80%
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:27:11 i mean, im almost certain the carrier should be in the water
and the planes on the flight deck
but the flight deck is above the water so try not to have heavy aircraft land on it
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:27:28 "Carrier Commando | Build an aircraft carrier capable of servicing aircraft. Entire flight deck must be above water in order to qualify. The aircraft carrier must be capable of moving around in the water."
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:27:52 " Aircraft Carriers must be capable of servicing at least 2 planes or 4 VTOLs."
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:31:39 and then there are those who dont car about reversions like me
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:32:01 care *
typos arent a big deal
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:32:22 o ok
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:32:48 if i can find your server, i can provide you with ladning my plane on it
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:32:59 but then youd still need anotehr one
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:11:25 you can edit them but it doesnt change the actual settings of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:11:40 as in you cant mess around their keybinds and mess them up
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:11:56 but you can however copy the keybinds on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:22:22 what is going on?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:26:29 oof
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:26:53 i still cant find your server
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:14 ik but last time i checked i cant join via profile
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:51 i m eant like i didnt have to option to join via profile
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:30:41 am the only one here who has 20/200 vision?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:30:56 20/200 aka legally blind
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:32:03 *that is, until you have to replace your glasses again*
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:35:24 i will but server profile searches are long and lenghty
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:35:52 and my acc is RedFireIndustries2 bc i have too many alts
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:37:14 ik ur account is that im saying that bc your settings doesnt allow everyone to join you game and im not friended i have to search the the server list for ur pfp
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:38:03 it should be privacy settings
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:38:06 i think?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:38:17 the fourth one
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:39:38 i found it finally
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:43:30 if ur gonna join join via RedFireIndustries2 bc i have my settings as so everyone can join
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:44:19 oof server is full
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 04:09:05 holdup lemme turn off my music
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 21:19:17 jet engines also refuse to save color
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 21:19:43 that is, unless you use the paint bucket for some odd reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 21:22:27 idek what im making
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 21:22:58 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 01:50:24 what in the world happened wen i was gone
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:16:02 made this thing for a 12x12 carrier lift
idek what it IS
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:16:44 ikr
but it isnt
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:16:52 at least i dont think so
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:18:37 it flies, at 185 dpees
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:18:40 speed*
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:28:04 i forogt to mention, that smol plane has no helium
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:47:29 i can now land at 55 speed
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:47:34 /i got 210
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:47:38 go not got
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:48:01 and i have 2 chutes, one for carrier final approach and one for nearing touchdown
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:50:07 1 is touch down 2 is final stop and parachute release 3 is bc i taxied
creations-chat 2019-03-11 04:52:38 ***i can land on that thing and use the lift now***
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:55:00 scree
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:55:06 is not centered
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 04:56:51 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 05:32:07 ***car***
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 05:41:51 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 21:56:48 would you consider school a full pvp server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 21:57:07 if not, then you know the answer
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:26:39 upwards facing ejection seats on helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:27:02 just eject the rotor and then the pilots
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:27:10 xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:27:49 isnt the nickname like the black shark or something?
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:28:47 dont even eject the swashplate ONLY THE ROTOR BLADES
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:29:52 the rice GROWS????
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:56:15 hmmmm, you can steal colors with the color dropper
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 23:56:38 well i apologize for not caring about the color dropper
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 01:25:19 ***ree its dusk for me***
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 01:32:50 bc im poor
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 01:33:04 please no, not again
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 02:59:47 crew capsule...i guess
no helium, just ballast
and no for the last time, its not the crew dragon, i dont know what it is
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:01:31 whatever this is idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:05:25 is it safe to pull the main chutes at 200 speed?
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:05:50 ***CAN I OPEN THEM DURING REENTRY***
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:06:40 just the pod rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:09:52 thats all i have rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:10:59 cap comes off wen u deploy the drogue chutes
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:11:13 they should be smaller ik
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:11:33 idc about spelling
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:11:42 as long as i get the point across
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:12:21 sure
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:47:18 chrome hates me ree
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 03:48:24 or just close solidowrks

plane-crazy 2019-03-12 04:09:36 i use that as an advantage
aka the cap on my command pod
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 04:24:01 HMM
the-dump 2019-03-12 04:29:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 04:32:37 ree its not synced its off by 0.784 seconds

plane-crazy 2019-03-12 05:32:53 build the giant rocket
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 05:33:23 and join cancerous curves simulator
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 06:59:30 my planes only needed to add/remove 1 helium block to fly
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 07:00:04 ima just START my hw now cyall
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 07:00:21 even tho its 12 am

plane-crazy 2019-03-12 08:05:04 stridel, im tryna make the wings fold so i can fit on the lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 08:05:18 also im still doing hw

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:12:45 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:13:44 wenever someone wants to copy me, if its low effort build. they can try if they want to. theyll just have to take pics of it wen im flying, or two, ill just tell them that they can, but they have to make it from memory
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:13:59 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:14:51 partition ur hard drive to have windows, but only get steam on that windows so u can run bootcamp
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:15:17 ***thats steam's only purpose for me***
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:15:35 all it does is run bootcamp so i can switch to mac
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:16:21 i prefer mac, but i used windows so i can make fake viruses and troll people at my school computers
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:17:07 correction you missed "rolling like a breeze" after the mountains
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:17:42 high off of recycled air?
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:18:04 yeah
high off recycled air confirmed

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:22:37 its the best prize you can get
eyes to read the ToS
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:23:27 high off of recycled air confirmed part 2
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:24:41 part 3 of getting high on recyled air confirmed?
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:53:33 this is my build restrictions (for stridel's carrier lift)
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:55:47 my f/a18 was built in the same area, but the wings are one block too big
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 00:56:02 its a 11x11 space
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:37:30 in that 11x11 space, i made this ksp jet
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:38:52 and ive tested, these work well with indents in carriers to land faster, but not smoother
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:39:58 my propeller plane's wings are just glorified landing flaps
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:41:50 for times when i dont trust myself to land smoothly
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:42:30 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:42:42 i just have to make it fit on stridel's carrier lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:42:44 nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:43:43 my old one built in the smae space, was one block off on the wings (i guess thats two but still) to fit in the lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:44:12 now
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:44:35 a very visible change
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:46:12 average flight speed of the old one was 210 and that was with one ballast block no helium
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:46:47 the new one (has the same amount of engines AND more blocks) flies at 310 average (430 in a dive) and has no helium or ballast
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:51:00 downside: roll time is slower
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 01:51:13 aka, ill turn slower
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 02:00:54 maybe....
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 02:01:01 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 02:03:54 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 02:10:30 kill ur friend and claim he gave you his guns

plane-crazy 2019-03-14 05:22:38 and personally i like to have it public so i can read the cringe wen i want to
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 05:22:51 or wen im wayyy to bored for my own good
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 00:17:02 wot did i join
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 02:33:03 id join but im working on hw and prop engines with landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 02:34:16 xd wen boolean algebra says 1+1 = 1 but ur learning that 1+1=10 and its all in the same class
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 02:34:38 ree
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 02:34:47 also landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 02:35:06 i mean i have a design for the gear but idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:25:02 when i said landing gear this is what i meant
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:25:08 
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:30:18 decently compact
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:33:25 i would share my design for that but its in the works so no, not any public ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:33:33 that i know of
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:35:09 belt fed mg's
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:35:26 but then again thats for model guns
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:35:53 also any opinions on my engine with landing gear so far?
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:39:06 one downside of how i have it, making the cover is cancerous
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:44:42 each landing gear is only about 66 blocks with like 2/3 of a cover
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:44:53 but then again
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:44:59 im using 1x1 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:45:04 but not any beams
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:45:17 so you COULD compress it
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:45:20 but ehh
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:48:13 pvc
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:48:33 Playing Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:49:51 g4, would there be any practical purpose for the engines with langing gear? (scroll up a bit)
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:53:36 the engines with gear, i wont have a use for bc i cant build decent looking aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:53:52 so what do i do with it
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:54:04 it just EXISTS rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:54:29 maybe after i finish a cover for it
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:54:53 its compact but the cover is like... gay
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:58:56 this cover is gae
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:00:00 lemme record it
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:01:47 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:04:00 https://streamable.com/5rarl
poor quality bc i dont wanna launch obs rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:05:26 havent tested it bc i got no plane xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:06:31 and that was a lucky video bc all the motors are on lock which surprisingly well (for the engine itself)
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:06:41 an entire plane?
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:06:42 idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:07:27 only problem with that was the locked motors refused to let the engine motor turn
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:08:01 the egine wasnt locked
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:08:12 the landing gear motor glitched itself into the engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:08:31 so it couldnt work properly
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:09:20 im assuming you can figure out the mechanism
if not just tell me (later) so ill get the simple mechanism for you
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:10:05 i dont want fuselage gear tho bc i was gonna make the bomb bay
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:10:15 but ehh
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:10:18 whatever
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:10:52 into the wings? im storing them in the engine
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:11:09 thats like
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:11:14 the only reason why i made that engine
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:11:35 so then the gear dont look edgy and ugly
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:11:43 they still do tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:12:38 and now that i think about it, i can have locking pistons for the gear to stay in place
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:12:48 but thats more work
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:12:53 and im too lazy rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:15:01 hmm but where would i put mine, ill figure out later
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:15:14 probably the non gear door side
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:16:15 its Possible just a bit different
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:20:43 so far tho it supports its own weight
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:20:57 and i cant take a pic rn bc roblox just crashed
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:22:37 and for the bomb bay ima just stick to my 24 bombs with explosive payload design
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:24:14 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/538524244171292682/551619378953715713/unknown.png
this alone containts 18 bombs with impact explosives
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:25:18 (its bombs made with Control Surface -> Cylinder -> Explosive) and just alternate explosive at top, then bottom then top then bottom etc
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:25:58 so maybe 24-32 bombs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:26:07 judgeing by the engine i made
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 04:26:14 ill be back
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 06:55:55 turismo, the earliest bday u can set it to is the day before. so now one of my alts is severly underage limit
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 06:56:05 i dont use that alt
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 06:56:21 i think its called ImNotUnderage337 or something

plane-crazy 2019-03-15 07:08:02 and i mean bug as in listening devices, hidden cams, etc

plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:03:25 just open ur personal parachute at high speeds
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:03:38 thats one way to do it
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:04:04 youll either 1) just continue to go that fast or 2) oblivion
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:04:13 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:05:54 do magnets affect parachutes
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:06:19 damn it used to
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:06:43 back wen we had 1500 parachutes yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:07:57 bc i was bouta make a plane that flew via parachutes and not wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:08:27 ***no, ammunition is***
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:09:18 **why do parachute storms still fly??**
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:11:26 i mean, i can still try to force the parachutes to be wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:11:34 but thatll prolly end horribly

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:01:25 reeeeee dont you hate dealing with PLD's on FPGA's?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:01:53 Programmable Logic Devices
Field Programmable Gate Arrays
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:02:10 uhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:02:11 water

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:09:23 reeeeeee i hate PLD configs
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:09:43 bc i dont know what kind of FPGA im using reeee
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:17:21 no u
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 03:52:16 no its 11x12x5

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 04:34:01 so g4 decides to stop procrastinating at the same time that i do 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 04:46:19 ree its a tutorial aircraft
the-dump 2019-03-26 23:36:57 **fresh taste***
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 23:42:13 chair
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:47:25 wait a second, now that we have explosive balls (for a while) i can use the drum mag again
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:47:56 but i have to use a new loading mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:47:59 ree
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:50:27 hmmmmm the drum mag i currently have contains approximately 22 rounds, all 3 blocks in length, if i replace it all with balls, thats approx 66 rounds
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:51:04 the canister mag is just 4 of those stacked on each other
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:51:44 so i could potentially load about rounds total
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:51:50 264*
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:52:53 it uses magnets, yes and if its segmented into 3 per area, it would most likely be a burst
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:53:49 the rounds that i have made are set to impact rounds, even tho the speed it fires it is 37k
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:54:14 i only know its 37 k bc i shot myself
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:54:59 yes, meaning theyll mostly go faster so ill have to edit with trial and error again
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:55:23 ill test with 1 rounds, then 3 then fill it in
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:56:02 the other speed for the impact detonation (it was a balast a cylinder and a impact explosive) was 154
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:56:11 ballast was set at 0.4
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:56:34 and i cant go on and take pics rn bc autodesk inventor is being a bitch so i cant do my hw
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:56:44 also inventor slows down my pc
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:58:43 id use solidworks rn but i dont wanna convert 1.6 gigs worth of files
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:58:53 about 2895 total files
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:59:34 nah
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:59:37 for homeowrk
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:00:04 then we print it at our school
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:01:34 its a project
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:02:18 i have to make the casings, code the FPGA's   (programmable circuit array), and then build it
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:02:21 thats just simplified
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:05:41 ugghhhhh now my pc says solidworks isnt installed
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:05:42 ree
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:07:06 highschool
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:07:14 sophomore
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:07:28 its engineering pathway
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:07:56 ah shit i forgot to do the boolean expressions
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:08:08 ill be back in like 30 minutes or less if i procrastinate
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:08:49 this is what i get for going for the aerospace sub-pathway
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:11:07 why has this happened to me, it deleted solidworks AND the file with my licensing
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 02:25:53 dont you hate it wen u have 14 gigs of open data and windows does a "software update" that removes 4 of ur applications and ur licensing just to add 1.5 MB of update?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:39:40 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:39:49 i tried to type if they added the swordfish yet

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 23:43:03 i speak █
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 23:43:47 id actually speak in binary but that is considered 1. spam by the bot. and 2. the fact this is an english speaking server

plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:07:11 motors dont require fuel right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:07:21 good
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:07:36 also apparently i dont have internet atm

plane-crazy 2019-04-02 01:25:05 a cessna 172
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 01:26:04 cessna 172 with 500 kg bombs
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 02:35:24 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 02:35:49 how much fuel you got?

plane-crazy 2019-04-02 06:29:33 in prolly a 10x9 space to make the heli
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 21:41:20 i dont even got room for fuel in some of my aircraft
mainly bc its mostly wedges, engines, or functionality blocks
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 21:41:36 (68 block aircraft)
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 22:12:58 eject the engines
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 23:57:37 does transparent count as a color
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:50:09 "delta"

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 03:07:51 hmmm, jet powered cropdusters
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 03:52:34 whats a tv show?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:13:02 curly be like me and have like 50+ alts
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:21:46 curly, now u know why i have started to abandon the freighter project
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:22:51 also curly, that build doesnt have anymore helium beams, 1x7's, and half wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:23:02 and only 100 super rockets left
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:23:19 well, wen u got soemthing thats HEAVY
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:23:23 you gotta use it
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:24:06 termin, you describe my life
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:24:44 curly, one time i used all the rocket engines, it refused to get up
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:24:51 hence why i use helium
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:25:04 only for that
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:25:07 nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:25:16 i dont use helium for anything else
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:25:30 i had box fold its just mad of cameras
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:26:16 im kinda sad, it got cut in 2/3's i could have done a 6 box fold for it

also roblox decided to yett my biplane save
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:27:08 yeet*
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:27:45 no u go search a PZL M-15 polish biplane
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:27:56 yes polish
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:28:39 heres the only problem
it was built wen poland was part of the soviet union
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:28:55 as a CROPDUSTER
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:29:02 a jet powered biplane cropduster
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:29:39 and also carries 2 passengers or cargo
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:31:22 PZL-Mielec M-15 "Belphegor"
was the name
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:32:11 it was deemed noisy and ugly
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:32:53 this thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 06:33:02 i just happen to not be able to build for shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:11:15 oof
the-dump 2019-04-22 20:05:36 i mean, it was at one point
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:06:51 foots
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:07:13 Foteses
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 00:10:12 oof
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 18:00:30 ~~wen ur on spring break but is still getting actively assigned hw~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 18:01:13 yes, bc wiring circuits without the materials to do so is easy
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 18:01:56 i leave for the school in 30 minutes to go complete my circuit due tmw
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 18:02:12 except noones prolly gonna be there
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:38:00 battleship, that much homework is normal..... in alot of places ~~including mine but noone gives a shit~~ so for us its not abuse ~~ok maybe slightly~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:38:45 oh, well gl in ur soph year
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:39:14 i have to make a fucking 6 page report in chemistry due by midnight the next day ree
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:39:36 chem is hell, mostly bc of the teacher (for us)
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:40:10 also our school might be different bc we gots them odd pathway things
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:40:27 env sci is always freshman (so it biology)
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:41:00 you gotta choose engineering, health and med, or crim& justice (but those pathways affect what classes u get)
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:41:07 naturally, im in engineering
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:42:56 for example, crim and justice are required to do terminology and forensics in sophomore
health is having to do CPR classes as a soph, and us engineers? we get to 3d model as a freshman xd ~~and its totally not bc we get the majority of funding~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:43:16 our school is decently new tho
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:43:34 aerospace is what sub-pathway im in
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:44:15 i have to learn physics and aerodynamics as a damn sophomore but the official class is in junior year
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:44:24 so ree
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:45:04 i plan on enrolling to either UCLA, or CSULB (Southern Cali)
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:45:31 trig and pre calc is in alg 2
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:45:37 just the basics tho
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:45:51 the actuall classes are in junior year
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:46:01 oof
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:46:35 trig is decently easy, if u know ur trangles and angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:46:50 ~~and ur radian chart~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:47:35 why has this happened to me.....hw JUST got assigned 2 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:48:02 and yes, theres pi radians in a 180* angle
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:48:19 also negative angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:48:29 also 450* angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:49:04 ree pong
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 21:49:38 battleship wdym ur 15.5 yrs but in 9th? im 15.5 yrs in 10th

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:19:11 and i dont mean by the ragdoll
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:19:41 sustained flight by "walking"
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:20:07 HMMM
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:20:12 ive made a glider of sorts
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:20:16 ill try to record a video

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:34:16 well then again theres alot of "malware" in my computer but thats literally code for robotics
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:35:20 its not from the internet
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:35:27 its from a club
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:36:21 yes, but that doesnt mean much to me, i do not understand your statement, could you try rephrasing it
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:37:36 also yeah, that might be one of the first, if not the first robloxian powered glider or whatever u want to call it by walking
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 03:41:07 ehh, ill just have to wait until a later date for the rephrasing i guess
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 05:55:16 voxel now u see thetrue power of robloxian powered flight
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 05:55:32 ~~and camera~~

plane-crazy 2019-04-28 18:38:20 i might start at 9 pm today
creations-chat 2019-04-28 18:39:48 video? maybe? idk
creations-chat 2019-04-28 19:28:18 yes, its possible
creations-chat 2019-04-28 19:28:38 i dont have one, but ive seen plenty
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 19:34:21 odd camera angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 19:34:27 i cant explain it
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 20:07:25 uhh neutro, if you would find Bellflower Blvd. and take a right on Lakewood Ave. You should find a costco. you can buy vegetable oil there
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:11 i made this bc i was bored, an E/A-18G Growler
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:17 
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:43 also ngl it flies decently even if the wings are folded
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:56:34 
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:58:29 also without reverse thrust, it takes about 1-2 plots after touchdown to completely stop rolling forwards
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:58:46 side note: i am aware this is <#384021699466756107> and not <#504436696021204992> , i sparsingly put creations i build in creations chat anyways, even tho some of them qualify for ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 02:34:54 technically i invented the 16 seg bc i had school issues
thought it was already done
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 02:57:18 hmm whats a movie
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 02:57:44 whats endgame xd
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:06:22 imperial, you mean the country that put about 200k landmines in our forests
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:09:45 kelvin
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:10:11 yeah, basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:15:16 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:26:35 it belonged to cessna originally
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 05:36:30 dont u hate it when ur keyboard died so u use the onscreen keyboard with autocomplete
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:20:50 oof, the carrier in the picture, i have a decent plane that can fit on it, its decently small, im not asking to join but im just saying i can
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:02:55 odd gun design, but it spins the round like rifling... by spinning the launch mags
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:20:10 idk but it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:31:55 looks ugly but launches stable rounds, (when i say stable i mean only rotation is roll)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:32:22 yeah, basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:34:55 only problem, the actually get a round to launch, i need 3 different stages of mags
the first stage is activating QE (the mags that spin, the actual mag that propels the round), the second BN (the mags to push the round into the QE mags), and keypad12 (to stop jamming of the mag)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:36:33 if the gun is angled at this angle, it land where the x is
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:36:36 
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:37:07 so that makes me wonder what speed the round goes
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:37:23 and the barrel isnt meant to fire a seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:41:18 snopping tool?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:02:18 i agree with neut, the wires bet annoying
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:02:22 get*
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:03:36 the only usb port is BEHIND the mac mini so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:04:20 besides, i can play plane crazy from my bed without worrying about wire contraints
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:04:30 ok i go now
creations-chat 2019-05-06 21:57:12 MAIF, now you also have the thing i have sitting in my save slots
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:02:08 yes
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:03:49 ah dont worry sometimes you wont receive ranks for approx. 58 days and counting
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:04:34 no like seriously im still waiting for submarine commander
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:05:21 grab teach me your ways so i can make that damned calico magazine
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:07:05 actually wait, i requested it on 2/16/19
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:08:05 personally i dont care much about ranks
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:13:11 this was the sub above water

creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:13:48 Also, i used literally a singular transparent pixel to send that in creations chat

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/546503445692284948/unknown.png
creations-chat 2019-05-06 22:21:03 technically it was never officially posted as a creation submission, only as a rank request submission. But its on the account DistantHunter (the same acc as my failure of a ppsh) and its modelled after a Type VIIC Uboat
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:22:38 oof, i have never built a surface house in minecraft =/
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:23:03 but i agree b0xel's house looks better
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:23:23 integex's looks more like a tavern
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:26:05 ew its above ground
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:26:25 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:27:36 its called loading
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:27:58 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:28:10 no i did not
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:28:42 concerns about why its flooded

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:14:32 i meant his requirements
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:14:51 its not what i need =/
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:14:57 its what he needs
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:15:03 im not the one asking for it
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:15:20 thats why i asked
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:17:05 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/564280391444332552/unknown.png
this is the smollest one i have, discord link is bc this is a month old snipping tool image
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:20:08 problem is, thats on another alt
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 02:22:26 thers a gun hidden in it but ehh
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 02:06:54 ree when u realize the trapdoor cant be glass
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 02:58:54 as of rn, this is the closest ive gotten to single rotor flight
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 02:59:42 originally i was gonna try NOTAR but ehh, also not atm no
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:00:19 who are you talking to exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:00:50 no i cannot hear anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:01:10 still nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:01:26 MD520/500 is what i modelled it off of
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:01:52 its more common sibling is the little bird
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:04:51 the only thing thats triggering me about that heli is not the flight. its the god damn skids
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:27:12 also if anyone wondered why the trapdoor stays on the side of the seats. its bc of disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:27:14 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:49:18 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/538524244171292682/577701057094746122/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:51:10 tbh, you could fit this on someone's ship's helipad. if the pad is minimum a 5x9
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 03:52:52 if anyone wants to try to copy it just to 1) put it as aesthetics or 2) try to perfect it's flight. message me
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 22:28:28 the coffee maker? excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 22:37:53 Walking doesnt use an engine. so just submit a video of ur character walking around

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:22:23 100 of my 110 partitioned GB is school stuff so i cant DELETE them
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:22:42 350GB goes to MACXOS (i rarely use it)
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:22:56 i need at least 50 GB for other things too
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:22:58 ree

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:50:08 ah dont worry katze, even tho its scorching in cambodia at all times. everyone wears winter coats
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 23:58:37 oh ffs partition process takes an hour
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:06:43 disregard the cutting up the cat. WHY DOES IT TELL YOU TO USE A COFFEE MAKER
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:08:19 like i swear. WHY
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:10:38 wait a second
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:10:48 i can partition my flash drive?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:13:41 OML so many warns
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 01:26:04 ***TANGERINE***
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 01:26:39 the longer i look at the word tangerine, the longer i think its misspelled
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:53:42 ree dyno has a 500 ms ping rn. on my server at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:54:28 well. technically 537 to be exact but ehh
general 2019-05-16 02:27:35 So im deciding to reinstall KSP, any mod (thats not a visual enhancement) that you'd recommend
general 2019-05-16 02:29:05 ATM i have
MechJeb2
DarkMP
BDArmory
TweakScale
KIS/KAS
PlanetaryBaseInc
KerbalAlarmClock
TransferWindowPlanner
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:29:55 at least they tried.
general 2019-05-16 03:08:22 hmm aight
general 2019-05-16 03:08:29 ill look into them
general 2019-05-16 03:09:32 personally, im asking bc the school approved of me using KSP for a project. mods make things alot easier
general 2019-05-16 03:11:04 hte only catch? i have to get to DUNA with a cost limit, all live.
general 2019-05-16 03:11:21 they havent specified
general 2019-05-16 03:11:53 well. they view KSP as a sim
general 2019-05-16 03:12:30 arc's, periapsis, and 3d modelling
general 2019-05-16 03:12:51 wen i get more info ill tell you
general 2019-05-16 03:14:05 atm, i only have a SSTO, no rockets bc of corruption bc of hard drive partitioning
general 2019-05-16 03:14:28 welp, ima go study for the AP test
general 2019-05-16 03:14:30 so cya
general 2019-05-16 03:16:02 also before i go, i have to worry about something i have never used before. Life Support
general 2019-05-16 03:16:20 apparently i have to deal with LS
general 2019-05-16 03:17:23 SIDE NOTE: BDArmory RDS-15 Cruise Missiles are a great short term Landing Booster
general 2019-05-16 03:25:13 now thats the problem
general 2019-05-16 03:25:19 i dont choose the LS mod
general 2019-05-16 03:25:34 it was a poll
general 2019-05-16 03:25:55 now thats the thing. Kerbalism was the highest.
and not my class its 5 people
general 2019-05-16 03:26:40 bruh, they sent us the manual.... the corrupted manual
general 2019-05-16 03:27:19 and bc theres 5 of us, we're all assigned a segment of the launch (hence why i have DarkMP)
general 2019-05-16 03:27:36 im assigned Crew Transfer from Kerbin to Luna
general 2019-05-16 03:27:47 yeah
general 2019-05-16 03:28:43 its literally my final. so much paper work to get to do this
general 2019-05-16 03:29:16 as in it took 15 of us 4 days 4 hours a day to do this
and yes our instructors send us the save file
general 2019-05-16 03:29:47 all we know is
Its Sandbox. with a money constraint
Kerbalism
general 2019-05-16 03:30:20 ***i *** personally dont have to
general 2019-05-16 03:30:29 others do
general 2019-05-16 03:30:53 im glad im not the gateway assembly person
general 2019-05-16 03:31:24 OR the fuel resupply assemply
general 2019-05-16 03:33:04 all in one
general 2019-05-16 03:34:49 16 total
general 2019-05-16 03:35:19 i plan on using a SSTO
general 2019-05-16 03:35:37 thx
general 2019-05-16 03:38:10 and we arent using days. we're using cycles (equivalent to 2.5 in game weeks)
general 2019-05-16 03:39:30 mission for the colonizers before returning to kerbin? survive 3 cycles
general 2019-05-16 03:39:49 meaning my second phase is cargo transfer
general 2019-05-16 03:41:17 how will i do this in one launch?, ill be using ejectable extermal command chairs (or a capsule) in a cargo bay. after crew transfer, ill leave the command capsule near the tranfer station and go pick up supplies (and refuel)
general 2019-05-16 03:41:49 one mod i thankfully dont have to deal with. DeadlyReEntry
general 2019-05-16 03:45:32 ah fun, manual page 15 and i can understand just basics
general 2019-05-16 03:54:04 in theory i could F up the entire operation. bc BDArmory
general 2019-05-17 00:34:36 i can get into orbit in this thing. and one WAS in orbit. until an AI Ship shot it down.
general 2019-05-17 00:35:16 i might go cluster bomb it
general 2019-05-17 00:36:40 tell to get rid of that ship, should i use 105mm aircraft cannons, Cluster Munitions, or a JDAM
general 2019-05-17 00:36:55 or should i outright use a warhead
general 2019-05-17 01:07:40 hmmmmm
general 2019-05-17 01:17:14 its decent. depends on how much funding you have. i personally prefer those but ehh im not sure
general 2019-05-17 01:21:06 ah
general 2019-05-17 01:23:08 in my opinion i would stick with the 7700 but as i said. im not sure
general 2019-05-17 04:03:40 EVA..... while ur plummeting towards the sun
general 2019-05-17 04:04:14 and yes, if ur fast enough you can collect a sample of the sun
general 2019-05-17 04:04:22 and transmit it
general 2019-05-17 04:51:52 ree KSP wont let me use teh ManualDockingAlignment Modification bc i dont have the correct dll file
general 2019-05-17 23:53:41 From This Point On: I might start posting pictures of the antics we do in our school ksp server
general 2019-05-18 03:37:01 Side Note: How are you not able to understand the Kerbalism manual
general 2019-05-18 03:39:37 tbh, as of rn, i prefer Kerbalism over TAC
for some odd reason
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:41:53 181 yrs until Chernobyl is safe again
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:42:02 according to the website
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:43:06 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:43:16 bet
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:43:41 does the pixel count change if i extend the page with inspect
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 03:43:58 im not gonna try atm bc other reasons
general 2019-05-18 03:47:05 this is my school modlist (kerbalism is on the server modlist [i have two copies of the game just cuz])
general 2019-05-18 03:48:24 by any chance, do you use SSTO's?
general 2019-05-18 03:49:51 hmmmm
general 2019-05-18 03:50:19 i might give you my SSTO then. mainly because i use it for duna transfer missions
general 2019-05-18 03:51:42 its a decent sirvice bay. i forget what it is tho bc its been 2 days since i launched it
general 2019-05-18 03:51:48 service ree
general 2019-05-18 03:52:25 the thing is, i cant make normal rockets, can only make ssto's=/
general 2019-05-18 03:52:42 my game is loading wait one
general 2019-05-18 03:53:01 oof ok
general 2019-05-18 03:53:49 problem is, most of my ssto's are converted into high altitude bombers
general 2019-05-18 03:54:37 whats the shallowest angle do you fly at to get them into orbit. if they say
general 2019-05-18 03:55:11 oof. 5 degree orbitals
general 2019-05-18 03:55:38 idk why i need 5 degrees to reach orbit, but hey, it works
general 2019-05-18 03:55:59 oh god, stationpartsexpanded is loading
general 2019-05-18 03:56:18 i dont even use station parts to make stations
general 2019-05-18 03:56:31 i just use their inflatable parts
general 2019-05-18 03:57:12 tbh, my pc is too shitty to run ksp decently with 4 other applications open
general 2019-05-18 03:58:03 just collect samples of the sun. ~~easy~~
general 2019-05-18 04:01:49 so i leave ksp on idle and it just commits die.
general 2019-05-18 04:02:07 as in i cant open it or close it via task manager
general 2019-05-18 04:02:51 is a minute considered a long period of time
general 2019-05-18 04:03:20 no, im asking. ya think 1 min is long
general 2019-05-18 04:03:33 ogod
general 2019-05-18 04:03:53 i mean, then again im launching it from a flash drive
general 2019-05-18 04:04:11 i gotta get it to school somehow
general 2019-05-18 04:04:49 Bruh
general 2019-05-18 04:05:20 i dont think ShipManifest likes me
general 2019-05-18 04:06:07 hmm, helicopter to duna. yes thats why i have AirplanePlus
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:06:19 ***End Task***
general 2019-05-18 04:08:49 Why is the Kerbal Parachute able to protect you from reentry =/
general 2019-05-18 04:09:54 the module manager broke
general 2019-05-18 04:10:17 bruh
general 2019-05-18 04:10:44 i only have to do a measly 15000 patches. with the low amount of mods i have
general 2019-05-18 04:13:17 bruh
general 2019-05-18 04:13:30 do people not pay attention to the names of SRB's
general 2019-05-18 04:14:07 i prefer the kickback for stock missiles tho
general 2019-05-18 04:15:23 which is one things i use with tweakscale
general 2019-05-18 04:15:50 tweakscale is useful for one thing. modded parts
general 2019-05-18 04:16:55 this is the ssto i use
general 2019-05-18 04:17:25 not stock but ehh
general 2019-05-18 04:17:37 ehh, OPT Expanded
general 2019-05-18 04:18:00 i only have OPT for the cockpits and the helicopter blades
general 2019-05-18 04:18:37 not all are futuristic
general 2019-05-18 04:19:06 oof?
general 2019-05-18 04:20:02 yeah seems reasonable
general 2019-05-18 04:21:45 tbh my end goal atm is dragging an asteroid back to each planet
general 2019-05-18 04:21:55 so maybe use that
general 2019-05-18 04:22:36 the randomly spawned asteroids that you can drag around. bring one to each planet's colony
general 2019-05-18 04:24:12 idk. i mainly use it to practice getting heavy lift to planetary orbit but idk
general 2019-05-18 04:25:46 and theres two colonies on each planet im aiming for
one surface, one station
general 2019-05-18 04:27:22 oof
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:42:28 0 in the morning is midnight tho
general 2019-05-18 05:43:52 whats in this massive rocket? a singular command pod xd
general 2019-05-18 05:44:06 thats the .325m i think
general 2019-05-18 05:44:28 thats literally all
general 2019-05-18 05:59:45 and yes the SRB's are tweakscaled bc otherwise i wouldnt have been able to gotten off the ground
general 2019-05-18 06:02:32 dont ask
general 2019-05-18 06:02:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:13 i have one, but i dont use the destroyer bc its literally 4 months old
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:27 i cant take a pic rn bc KSP
general 2019-05-18 06:23:20 bruh
general 2019-05-18 06:23:38 also, im using a coaxial bc i dont want to deal with counter rotation rn
general 2019-05-18 06:26:01 that heli is legit made in a minute
general 2019-05-18 06:26:23 id spend more time but its almost midnight
general 2019-05-18 06:26:40 what was that?
general 2019-05-18 06:27:01 oh, no we didnt
general 2019-05-18 06:27:38 i was more interested in watching the show at vandenburg
and we learn soldering in 10th grade
general 2019-05-18 06:28:32 oh
general 2019-05-18 06:28:47 we'll mostly be soldering IC chips
general 2019-05-18 06:30:22 manned. its easier to do a mun flyby with a manned pod in my opinion
general 2019-05-18 06:30:29 only problem is LS
general 2019-05-18 06:31:32 what about science junior pods or mystery goo, well, then youd have to recover it
general 2019-05-18 06:31:44 hmm
general 2019-05-18 06:32:48 for now id say just use a probe, get money, and a slight amount of science, but in the end its ur rocket
general 2019-05-18 06:33:25 i mean, you know u can just offset the parachutes in the capsule
general 2019-05-18 06:33:43 oh
general 2019-05-18 06:34:29 but yeah, offsetting the things to be slightly showing helps with reentry
general 2019-05-18 06:35:08 for now, im sending a helicopter to the mun... for no particular reason
general 2019-05-18 15:31:45 hmmmm
general 2019-05-18 15:31:49 ill consider looking at it
general 2019-05-18 16:20:54 you know i might port forward my pc just so i can run a public server
general 2019-05-18 17:09:49 hmm
general 2019-05-18 17:09:56 blanacing took a bit
general 2019-05-18 17:50:07 reasons
general 2019-05-18 19:47:48 its just off topic
general 2019-05-18 19:48:48 bc people mainly use it for ksp
general 2019-05-18 20:23:31 ik its shit but it gets the job done, just to get science from around kerbin
general 2019-05-18 20:26:21 and, it has intake problems sometimes
general 2019-05-18 20:26:55 otherwise its a great thing for easy science. but then again its AirplanePlus Parts so ehh
general 2019-05-18 20:33:08 average 50 m/s flight speed
general 2019-05-18 20:33:18 thats at a tilt of -10 degrees
general 2019-05-18 20:33:24 correction
general 2019-05-18 20:33:25 -5
general 2019-05-18 20:35:57 its just 3.228 tons
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:36:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:37:19 excuse me but the @ is slightly bigger
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:38:04 do it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:38:46 Roblox has stopped responding reeeee
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:42:25 @noone
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:47:35 wdym, my ears are fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 00:06:26 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 00:19:00 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 00:20:56 i assume ur doing the ping roulette thing
the-dump 2019-05-19 00:22:50 bruhh, nether portals are not limited to the 5x4
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 02:12:33 highest i remember was 3.3k
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 03:02:05 my lander may have too much thrust
general 2019-05-19 03:29:01 Drop Pods
general 2019-05-19 03:29:20 
general 2019-05-19 03:29:50 the parachute at the top is just incase i deploy airbrakes too late
general 2019-05-19 03:30:16 also i dont actually need the drogue chutes
general 2019-05-19 03:32:42 this is the 2 minute rocket i made to test it
general 2019-05-19 03:33:09 hmmm
general 2019-05-19 03:33:28 hmhmmmmmmm
general 2019-05-19 03:34:15 ono the heatying has begun
general 2019-05-19 03:35:19 
general 2019-05-19 03:35:51 
general 2019-05-19 03:37:24 
general 2019-05-19 03:37:47 
general 2019-05-19 03:40:11 
general 2019-05-19 03:53:27 oh, bc my pc is running a update for applications in the background so i have to lower my graphics otherwise my pc dies
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 03:56:16 the ones that hack
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 03:56:42 not exploit, the ones that hack. what are they hacking? idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:07:19 aluminum pan
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:07:40 just use an aluminum pan, youll be FINE
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:10:30 exactly, ur FINE if u hold the pan
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:10:57 idk how much AIR im on
general 2019-05-19 04:19:35 i dont listen to music =/
general 2019-05-19 05:05:47 Drop Altitude
general 2019-05-19 05:06:22 dont ask why im dropping at 1.274M meters
general 2019-05-20 02:40:34 Side note: for some reason the drop pod kills my comp... its literally 14 blocks. BUT if i put 4 of them in the VAB, everything is fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:44:28 i mean, you could always just memorize them. but that takes too long for some people
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:48:14 so i have this project i want to do, but im just procrastinating on it, i want to make it, but i dont want to get on roblox atm, so overall, ill just procrastinate for another 2 months
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:48:53 what is this project? logic gates using unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:52:24 give me like a month and maybe
general 2019-05-20 03:01:48 Computer
general 2019-05-20 03:03:07 it can handle 4 pods but dies on 1
general 2019-05-20 03:11:07 dont ask why
general 2019-05-20 03:20:47 REASONS
general 2019-05-20 03:25:16 so it survived reentry without a heatshield
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:20:40 And there are also some of us that don't watch movies whatsoever. that is... until alot later on (personal preference)
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:15 i mean, the word discord is censored so ehh. you can sometimes say it and sometimes u cant
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:45 WhAtS a B-17?/????/
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:57 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:25:48 yeah, you can tell its roblox from the pic
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:25:52 the WHEEL
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:27:21 Should i restart mag cannon development?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:27:56 bc i kinda stopped playing PC overall bc of schoolwork. and because i dont know what to build
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:42:10 that ET is a bit large. just saying
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:10 Hey, if it works, it works. so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 05:14:50 i mean, thats one way to make a clover... just without the stem
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 05:54:11 thts odd bc currently its says 12:53 AM
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:34:56 ree id get on roblox but i have to deal with synchronous counters atm.... specifically 74LS163N and 74LS193N Chips
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:36:56 i cant do anything in VR bc GLASSES
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:37:29 Thats why i have prescription VR Lenses
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:37:34 xd
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:37:41 dont ask why
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:38:09 its █████
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:38:42 now heres the thing. i dont have a VR system, i just have the lenses
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:39:11 its whenever i go to a VR Flight Sim area and i cant see shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:39:24 so i give them the lenses so i can actually SEE
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:39:55 ofc the only downside with that is i have to carry my certificate of legal blindness around ree
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:44:38 am i the only semi active person in this server that has 20/250 vision?
What i can see at 20ft is what a normal person with 20/20 can see at 250ft
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:46:54 So, you're also legally blind?
as in the threshhold is beginning at 20/200
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:47:01 ree threshold
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:47:56 a SSTO basically?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:48:13 Single Stage To Orbit
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:48:42 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:53:50 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 00:59:13 Who's to say it isnt just Google Chrome Renamed
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 02:20:21 vip1 has recently been dead
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 02:20:32 for quite a long time too
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 03:05:35 or, you know be like me, who USED to memorize how tall the dummy was. then i stopped with studio
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 04:29:17 id be down, id prolly be the smallest but id be down
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:20:14 Do you have schoolloop? if so just click hide grades or something and just take a pic of the classes. that might work. idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:10:22 I've seen that mech somewhere.... i cant seem to remember where
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:40:44 Is ThAt PiRaTeD fOoTaGe??//???
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:05:34 voxel, you sure ur f117 was in 2017? the timestamp says 2018
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:05:55 oh

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:20:17 i guess ill hibernate for 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:21:34 i should seek medical attention, ive eaten 10 cough drops in th epast 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:22:10 welp, 46 more cough drops to go
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:22:50 i mean my HR is slightly faster, but im not that concerned
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:24:43 DaMn I gOt A c- On My HeArT eXaM
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:25:46 im not lying either
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:29:01 ree deploy is so CLOSE
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 03:30:09 should i be worried
general 2019-05-25 01:13:30 welp time to fuck around in ksp
general 2019-05-25 01:15:09 also i now prefer the ALCOR command pod instead of the mk1 command pod
general 2019-05-25 01:17:43 the only reasons? IVA
general 2019-05-25 01:17:58 ksp is kinda loading atm tho
general 2019-05-25 01:19:10 what should i do in the game
general 2019-05-25 01:19:35 because i may or may not have a helicopter on minmus atm
general 2019-05-25 01:19:56 its, there, it cant get back or around. but its there
general 2019-05-25 01:25:23 oh god vessel viewer just commited die
general 2019-05-25 01:31:03 i mean mechjeb is an easy way to space them. if you know how to use the rendezvous planner
general 2019-05-25 01:33:38 i only use mechjeb for 1. rendezvous, and 2. dV
general 2019-05-25 01:34:23 yes, well atm i have to deal with 1.5.1 bc of the school's restraints
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 00:08:51 why, just why? josh
the-dump 2019-05-26 00:09:42 Average life in california souns like

plane-crazy 2019-05-26 05:32:13 If you're going to post it, do it in the dump maybe
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 05:33:22 ~~i only said to put it in the dump bc of what i posted in the dump, doubt anyone will try to translate it~~
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 20:05:01 whats winter... temperature in southern CA is all year round
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 20:05:10 is constant all  year round*
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 20:09:27 the only time ksp is taxing on cpu is if u have a large creation. and sometimes when ur loading (for me at least)
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 20:11:25 you know. i should start a DMP server for ksp bc im that bored
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 20:14:57 HmMmMmMmMMMm
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:13:21 Now heres the thing. im not up to date on memes, and i dont watch anime so ehh

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 22:50:52 i really dislike designing compact ejectors
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 23:10:36 this makes me want to stop playing PC again. not being able to cover this up. all for a ejector seat
creations-chat 2019-05-28 06:06:42 you dare use red, for letters, dont make me bring back the sixteen segment display
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 06:07:51 why did it take me 2.56 hours to make something count from 0-60 ree

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 05:42:27 you tried reloading the save?
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:14:51 thats a nice pen you got there. but wheres the ink
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:16:09 on my accounts, should i start building these again? not this specifically but things like it
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:18:54 thats a pencil not a pen =/
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:21:40 this archaic technology still works
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:23:03 and i mean archaic.
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:28:44 im done with this discord. my 16 segment from JANUARY is still getting upvoted
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:30:04 which block
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:30:09 oh that block
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:30:25 now heres the thing. was the block not pinned at some point
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:30:49 yea. its the very last pin
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:32:01 tbh i never upvoted the block
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:32:12 i didnt downvote it either
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:35:02 yknow, its not the bluescreen, the keyboard, the mouse or the tower that bothers me
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:35:05 its the wiring
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:35:22 especially the bends in the wire
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:35:53 ehh. that happens on a normal basis
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:47:08 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:47:23 be like me. have 56+ roblox alt accounts for plane crazy alone
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 06:48:01 but then stop playing bc u dont know what to build. and the things u want to build are complex as hell
general 2019-05-29 15:28:24 reasons

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 05:08:10 personally the fact that i have a clipboard manager kinda helped me not run into that issue for the past 5 months
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 05:13:34 i mean, why not just do Win+R then cmd?
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 05:19:37 obviously its true. its coming from a random person

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 05:30:15 a trapdoor can also be a arresting hook
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 05:32:23 you can mount it properly by a disconector that the trapdoor is attached to
general 2019-06-02 00:53:31 ***concerned on why u dont know how to dock***
general 2019-06-02 00:58:20 might as well launch ksp atm
also who needs the map or maneuver nodes to get a circular orbit
i use landing aim to circularize ~~end me~~
general 2019-06-02 00:59:55 my space station is in a circular orbit and thats the only time i circularize other times i jkust leave it as an ellipses
general 2019-06-02 01:00:53 here wen i finish booting up ill show you one of my space crafts orbits
and elliptical orbit that goes slightly past mun and i dont like it bc the mun sometimes steals it
general 2019-06-02 01:02:24 well, im too lazy to circularize sometimes
general 2019-06-02 01:03:21 aerobraking?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 01:04:01 no, its a cessna 172

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:51:29 there
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 19:51:31 i think

general 2019-06-02 20:42:14 google
general 2019-06-02 20:42:24 extract files to a folder
general 2019-06-02 20:42:30 put that folder in GameData
general 2019-06-02 20:43:20 usually in the extract folder theres a folder called GameData
take the files from there and paste them into the file directory of ksp's GameData
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 20:47:35 the hat is interns
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:25:26 tbh i thought the gun was the engine at first ree
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:43:57 ahh no big deal......
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:56:13 oof?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:56:36 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:57:50 its a decent aircraft, better than id build at that scale, but random question, how do you roll bc i can see pitch and yaw but not really roll
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:59:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 21:59:56 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:00:49 left and right movement
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:01:16 oof, i only use yaw wen landing on carriers
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:03:29 tbh i dont know why i have an ejector seat on a decently thin plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:03:58 
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:04:16 
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:08:26 yes i know its small. for something i spent 20 minutes on, its a decent flier
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:09:17 this is why i dont drop the bombs untill AFTER i take off
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:12:19 ah yes
grab that is the best thing ive heard
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:12:37 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:12:46 thats the point of 17 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 23:16:41 internet test 3
general 2019-06-03 01:40:30 hmmm should i start a dedicated lmp/dmp ksp server?
general 2019-06-03 01:42:23 hmm
general 2019-06-03 01:42:41 ill just need to port forward and know what mods so support on it
general 2019-06-03 01:43:34 yea but idk if i should use LMP or DMP
general 2019-06-03 01:44:17 Both are corbon copies of each other but the community is arguing over one another
general 2019-06-03 01:44:23 carboN*
general 2019-06-03 01:44:36 ***CORBON***
general 2019-06-03 01:45:41 i go for more command pods over engines tbh
but its ur choice in the end
i only do that so i can build more
general 2019-06-03 01:46:07 bruh
general 2019-06-03 01:48:11 ssto designs i prioritize over ALOT bc they are useful in many ways
like for one, its a good way for payloads without returning to SPH or VAB
general 2019-06-03 01:48:37 well damn
general 2019-06-03 01:49:10 we should prolly add Community Tech Tree as a mod bc science gets useless after a while
general 2019-06-03 01:49:29 true
general 2019-06-03 01:50:13 Deadly Reentry and Comfortable Landing?
general 2019-06-03 01:51:22 one thing we are NOT getting is the ALCOR expansion, that thing is literally too much for ONE command pod
general 2019-06-03 01:51:52 Deadly ReEntry is more heat, instability, and more ablators
general 2019-06-03 01:52:01 as in airbrakes ablation version
general 2019-06-03 01:52:23 it got implemented into a version of DRE
general 2019-06-03 01:52:30 ye
general 2019-06-03 01:52:34 that might help
general 2019-06-03 01:52:39 for people who dont have expansions
general 2019-06-03 01:53:42 if we're going APUS im adding VV and AirplanePlus
general 2019-06-03 01:53:59 hmmm
general 2019-06-03 01:54:17 havent tried it
general 2019-06-03 01:54:25 you know what VV is right?
general 2019-06-03 01:54:50 its only purpose is to help people who go IVA launches
general 2019-06-03 01:55:38 its Vessel Viewer, one of the small black screens in a pod shows structural integrity, fuel, if it can be detached, adds memory light external cameras, etc
general 2019-06-03 01:56:04 aight
general 2019-06-03 01:56:48 ill look into these after i get the base server up
general 2019-06-03 01:57:59 BDA is optional
general 2019-06-03 01:58:19 ye, its optional
general 2019-06-03 01:58:23 depends if people want it
general 2019-06-03 01:59:00 KAS and KIS?
general 2019-06-03 01:59:21 ye
general 2019-06-03 01:59:50 idk how soon i can get a server up tho
general 2019-06-03 02:00:32 one that i WANT but will prolly kill peoples pc's is FAR
general 2019-06-03 02:00:46 Ferram Aerospace Research
general 2019-06-03 02:00:53 yea
general 2019-06-03 02:01:18 its good that it stops alot of bugs but bugs is what makes ksp ksp
general 2019-06-03 02:02:14 anyways ill be back, i have to go do stuff

that will be decided later

LMP and DMP can have a server run and change a mode during its running
general 2019-06-03 02:02:30 and yes, LMP/DMP allows for carrer
general 2019-06-03 02:02:43 CAREER REE
general 2019-06-03 02:02:56 kk
general 2019-06-03 02:06:45 the only thing it doesnt like is
if the host doesnt have any dlc, any dlc part will summon the kraken
if the host has the dlc, anyone who doesnt have the dlc will be destroyed by the kraken
If the dlc's are disabled, its stock ksp. just stock ksp, with mods, but you cant click the dlc items, you can see them, just cant click them
general 2019-06-03 02:07:22 hmm
general 2019-06-03 02:08:03 if we cant have breaking grounds i might as well agg MagicSmokeIndustries so we can have motors, bc i use motors ALOT
general 2019-06-03 02:09:04 the client doesnt need to install the mod to have the part show up, they just cant interact with that craft
general 2019-06-03 02:09:40 i only know this bc im searching for my old server files
general 2019-06-03 02:10:21 it depends on what kind of server u want
moddedNightly or moddedRelease
general 2019-06-03 02:11:01 moddedNightly is the dev build, each players gets there own KSC located somewhere on kerbin, moddedRelease is stable stock ksp
general 2019-06-03 02:11:17 both are publixc
general 2019-06-03 02:11:30 i dont care which one
general 2019-06-03 02:11:49 maybe later, not now
general 2019-06-03 02:12:00 dont advertise until i have a server up
general 2019-06-03 02:12:09 ill be back again
general 2019-06-03 02:12:40 hmm
general 2019-06-03 02:14:04 wdym by complacted
general 2019-06-03 02:14:09 complicated ree
general 2019-06-03 02:14:37 oh
general 2019-06-03 02:15:02 you mean j size etc
general 2019-06-03 02:16:06 i can give ip rightnow, for later
general 2019-06-03 02:17:48 192.163.86.24 i think
general 2019-06-03 02:27:28 DarkMultiPlayer - Based on an Older MultiPlayer Engine
LunaMultiPlayer - Based on DMP
general 2019-06-03 02:28:50 lemme bring up the two websites
general 2019-06-03 02:29:38 http://lunamultiplayer.com/
general 2019-06-03 02:29:53 https://d-mp.org/
general 2019-06-03 02:29:59 for people who dont know
general 2019-06-03 02:30:31 Supports career and science modes (funds, science, strategies, etc are shared between all players).
This is on LMP
general 2019-06-03 02:30:54 then again they arent exact bc LMP got updates like a few weeks ago
general 2019-06-03 02:31:40 kk, just expect me to have lower fps bc the hoster will have a portion of their ram taken by the server
general 2019-06-03 02:32:00 and i aint about to pay like $15 for a server
general 2019-06-03 02:32:08 monthly
general 2019-06-03 02:32:30 sure i CAN pay for it but id rather not
general 2019-06-03 02:33:11 make it a doc so we can all type it
general 2019-06-03 02:33:19 mbson377@gmail.com
general 2019-06-03 02:33:24 to share it
general 2019-06-03 02:33:35 ur choice
general 2019-06-03 02:34:47 kk
general 2019-06-03 02:35:27 and if it says my name is Kevin Morales, thats not actually my name
general 2019-06-03 02:47:27 oh
general 2019-06-03 02:48:02 i didnt get PBInc from KPBS
general 2019-06-03 02:48:23 what i suggest is just a suggestion, otherwise its ur choice
general 2019-06-03 02:51:31 oof, ive somewhat already dm'ed
general 2019-06-03 02:51:45 whatever
general 2019-06-03 02:52:40 im kinda working on that but problem is
general 2019-06-03 02:53:00 next week is regular finals not ap finals
general 2019-06-03 02:53:09 and the week after that is pathway assessments
general 2019-06-03 02:53:29 pathway assessments is the week i have to land on duna
general 2019-06-03 02:53:40 with kerbalism
general 2019-06-03 02:56:36 ye, except i leave my computer on hibernate and i never shut it down but u can try hosting one if u want to
general 2019-06-03 02:57:11 ehh, we both have the same ram then
general 2019-06-03 02:57:40 i just happen to have prior knowledge on running servers
general 2019-06-03 02:58:17 schoolwork, and the setup takes a while
general 2019-06-03 02:58:52 stock game setup is easily 3 hours alone bc it has to read my computer and the people joining
also i have to go reenable my port forward settings
general 2019-06-03 03:04:15 also a school project (they never said i couldnt use ksp for this one) im doing an orbital debris field around kerbin (bc i dont want to do launches im using alt f12 to get to orbit , the only purpose, deploy as many fairing as possible in a sible launch
general 2019-06-03 03:05:03 of the supposed 375k objects in space, i have 234k objects around kerbin
general 2019-06-03 03:05:10 mostly fairings
general 2019-06-03 03:06:20 which is why i dont time warp
general 2019-06-03 03:06:47 also the despawn timer is deleted from my game files
general 2019-06-03 03:07:32 yes, there are some satellites in orbit in collision paths ON purpose in the simation
general 2019-06-03 03:07:36 simulation
general 2019-06-03 03:07:59 also i wont take a pic bc i dont like taking pics at 2.344 fps
IDK when im going to start it up
general 2019-06-03 03:09:09 you should try setting one up, also once the server is running, no matter how laggy the game is, the server will not take up more than 5% of ur disk, 10% of cpu, and 7% of memory
general 2019-06-03 03:09:25 thats the conditions ive seen the highest at
general 2019-06-03 03:09:44 that was a 0.0932 fps clusterfuck
ye
general 2019-06-03 03:09:50 should be yes
general 2019-06-03 03:10:01 thats for initializations
general 2019-06-03 03:10:20 afterwards youll find new files
general 2019-06-03 03:10:23 thats serer setup
general 2019-06-03 03:10:35 one of those files is PartWhitelist or something like that
general 2019-06-03 03:10:43 heres the annoying part
general 2019-06-03 03:11:05 You have to find the name of each part, modded or not, and put that into the txt document
general 2019-06-03 03:11:20 same thing for players, settings, mods etc
general 2019-06-03 03:11:36 now you can close that and do file editting
general 2019-06-03 03:12:12 oh also noone can join you (unless its for LAN) until you port forward the pc
general 2019-06-03 03:12:33 the directories im not sure but they all get compiled in the LMPserver fodler
general 2019-06-03 03:12:37 folder
general 2019-06-03 03:13:13 config, check there i thing
general 2019-06-03 03:13:15 think
general 2019-06-03 03:13:36 send a pic
general 2019-06-03 03:14:35 youll have to edit

general 2019-06-03 03:14:53 ye
general 2019-06-03 03:15:16 the rest u can find online, i dont remember much from here bc my guide doc got corrupted
general 2019-06-03 03:16:23 i prefer getting Notepad++ for editting them
general 2019-06-03 03:16:44 youll also have to edit Universe AFTER you playtest them
general 2019-06-03 03:16:56 and plugins is for the dll files
general 2019-06-03 03:16:59 like module manager
general 2019-06-03 03:17:38 thats the thing, my guide doc got corrupted im not sure, search it up, i might search it up in a bit
general 2019-06-03 03:17:50 also have you port forwarded?
general 2019-06-03 03:18:21 i dont want to port forward bc last time i tried, this wifi appeared xd
general 2019-06-03 03:19:00 and from the presentations we had from the LB Bomb Squad, their wifi signals look almost exactly the same
general 2019-06-03 03:19:31 they're both TCP connections with no DCFP encryption
general 2019-06-03 03:20:27 dmp server config is much easier but its rough to start the server
general 2019-06-03 03:23:41 i mean, you could prollynot tell the others you did something when they're all offline
general 2019-06-03 03:27:58 if i cant run a server ill prolly config them and put a zip file up for someone to run
general 2019-06-03 03:28:20 theyll just have to change ip and port and then port forward theyre pc
general 2019-06-03 03:28:28 their
general 2019-06-03 03:29:40 you mean things like netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=[your_local_ip_adress] listenport=80 connectaddress=[any_ip_adress] connectport=[any_tcp_port]
general 2019-06-03 03:30:00 or things like searching up ur ip address
general 2019-06-03 03:31:01 yea its a hassle
general 2019-06-03 03:31:07 by chance
general 2019-06-03 03:31:15 do you have the google wifi application?
general 2019-06-03 03:31:21 for phone
general 2019-06-03 03:31:34 bc that just makes port forwarding literally 3 taps
general 2019-06-03 03:32:10 it should
general 2019-06-03 03:32:29 you just need to know router username nd password, thats the sticker on the router
general 2019-06-03 03:34:57 damn
general 2019-06-03 03:37:46 oof
general 2019-06-03 03:38:08 its this video again reee
general 2019-06-03 03:43:51 isnt it on the sticker on the router?
general 2019-06-03 03:44:27 oof
general 2019-06-03 03:44:51 then search for the command prompt version of it
general 2019-06-03 03:49:34 idrk, i use otehr methods and not cmd, cmd is a last resort so im not sure
general 2019-06-03 23:26:41 bruh i just got hme, but u could add it
general 2019-06-04 00:57:31 Finals and Pathway Assessments > Setting up a KSP Server
general 2019-06-04 00:58:16 next week is pathway assessments, this week is finals
general 2019-06-04 00:58:40 2 weeks minimum, my life is decently busy
general 2019-06-04 00:59:04 also programming a CNC Mill is not easy to do while testing
general 2019-06-04 00:59:22 ill try to get some things done over weekends tho
general 2019-06-04 01:00:23 by any chance does anyone here know anything about long strings of G-Code
general 2019-06-04 01:03:36 pathway assessments is gonna be hell. Wiring a counter to display multiple birthdays. Sounds easy-ish but its really infuriating when you dont have a guide of any sorts
general 2019-06-04 01:06:58 just to give an example,

plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:12:10 so wait, ur saying apple wants 35k for a cheese grater?
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:12:21 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:13:09 what did i just say xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:14:03 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:14:22 apple zest will be a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:21:27 heres the thing, can it run CHROME
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:21:40 you sell it
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:21:51 not legally
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:22:31 it better support KSP Dedicated servers with North Kerbin Dynamics on it
general 2019-06-04 04:23:03 you can technically get past it, just not legitimately
general 2019-06-04 04:23:09 how? Alt+F12
general 2019-06-04 04:23:59 have you tried ***SET ORBIT***
general 2019-06-04 04:24:35 or just use HyperEdit Lander Configuration
general 2019-06-04 04:24:59 you select the body ***INCLUDING THE SUN*** the altitude and the long/lat and u teleport there
general 2019-06-04 04:25:13 i only use hyperedit so i can LAND ON THE SUN WITHOUT DYING IMMEDIATELY
general 2019-06-04 04:25:33 correction, you fall thru the sun, theres a rock in the center of the sun
general 2019-06-04 04:25:52 except that rock hates everything that exists
general 2019-06-04 04:26:13 as in, if you revert flight while on that rock, you wont have a KSC anymore
general 2019-06-04 04:26:21 i wont say anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:26:39 run internet explorer?
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:26:56 a dedicated IE server
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:29:03 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 04:29:20 ksp, except its 100 players. and they all have nukes
general 2019-06-04 04:39:51 I cant make cargo aircraft anymore but ehh
general 2019-06-04 22:39:54 id rather have voxel get it in case my pc dies while server setup
general 2019-06-04 22:41:11 oof
general 2019-06-04 22:41:24 also rick went offline when u said that so hmm
general 2019-06-04 22:41:47 i need to get a better pc. i swear
general 2019-06-04 22:44:27 i need to go check so ehh brb
general 2019-06-04 22:45:12 its not even me who decided to get it, my uncle just decided to give us it, decent for most 3d modelling software and CDS
general 2019-06-04 22:45:54 chrome decided to not respond
i know its a mac mini, im looking for the model
general 2019-06-04 22:47:12 mgem2ll/a mac mini late 2014
general 2019-06-04 22:47:49 its useful to me as long as i can run multisim at 50 fps
general 2019-06-04 22:48:32 i run windows on it so EHH.
general 2019-06-04 22:48:48 well. hard drive is partitioned so ehh
general 2019-06-04 22:49:15 out of 750 gb its 200 to macxos and 550 to windows
general 2019-06-04 22:50:11 oof intel i5
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 23:02:19 ree i prefer WACO gliders over horsa gliders
plane-crazy 2019-06-04 23:04:02 or maybe a hamilcar glider
general 2019-06-05 00:50:33 this prolly wont sound like much help but when making a ssto, design it like a manned rocket with a cargo bay instead of fairings, then worry about making it look like a space plane
general 2019-06-05 00:50:44 thats how i usually build my ssto's
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 00:51:52 the best movie is not watching movies
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:35:53 Probably the Worst WACO made on this discord. scales to the size of robloxian, fits 12 (WACO CG-4's normally contain 13 or a jeep with cargo)
First Craft made on PC in the past month as well as in preparation for 2 days
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:36:03 also, door
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:36:27 and why is this not in <#384025409945337856> ? i never post there anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:37:01 according to COM, COL and overall mass. it should fly.. if it wasnt a glider
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:37:25 Made with 68 disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:38:18 originally i was gonna make it 200 blocks exact but then i got lazy and didnt try to
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:39:20 time to launch roblox and have discord die again
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:41:43 theres only one thing left to do. put engines on it and watch it crash and burn
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 05:06:51 side note it only takes 2 jet engines. no helium no ballast. and 3 prop engines (im too lazy to add actual control surfaces) to fly the damn glider
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 05:07:18 i can get pics another day. preferably 2 days from now
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 05:19:32 hmmmm. its been a while since i heard gunpoint
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:14:31 i mean. i have a kinda decent WACO CG-4A Glider.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 23:24:32 my old kmax could also
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:27:42 you CAN. i dont know how but overall... you dont
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:31:42 FoRnIIe
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:32:17 Gay, they forogt the extra blade !!!!111!///
general 2019-06-06 23:33:36 ***if it works, it works***
general 2019-06-06 23:39:40 the fourth option
general 2019-06-06 23:40:06 leaving ur kerbals to suffocate while in orbit around the sun
general 2019-06-06 23:42:45 oof
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:57:27 idk, i might get into the server tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:58:12 just go into options and make that light grey the transparency filter
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:58:38 uhhhhh.. i use GIMP only so i can get transparent backgrounds
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:18 hmm. i found a transparent pixel in my files
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:26 yes people are in vip1
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:51 wait on
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:07 here you go
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:39 i already posted it, at the end of these messages is a transparent pixel
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:58 
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:10:25 
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:11:24 hmm. i saw my mouse flicker on that so hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:12:36 HMM
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:13:40 use a third party source and walk close to 0 but not at 0
general 2019-06-09 01:55:41 its ur choice, i have to deal with soldering and wiring a FM radio rn
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 01:56:32 ok i wont ask how
why?
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 01:56:56 aight
general 2019-06-09 20:42:04 what do you need explaining, im only setting up the server, cant actually host it my pc is too trash
general 2019-06-09 20:49:15 LMP Public Release
Career Mode MP
Every player has their own science points but all points contribute to the same tech tree, you all use one KSC, you also use the same money as well as reputation, kerbals, etc, plan wisely
Science Mode
Same as career, without money involved
Sandbox
 Same as Science Mode and Career, you dont have to worry about anything tho

LMP Dev Build (Nightly)
Career Mode
You all have different KSC's around Kerbin; Science, money, kerbals, reputation, etc is for your KSC only, useful for storylines
Science
View desc for PubRel
Sandbox
Varying options between one ksc and multiple
View desc for PubRel

Mods
Every mod plugin, mod part, and mod file have to be put into its respective places, for some reason im the only one who knows how to do thios bc i hosted DMP servers and LMP is basically a similar copy of DMP
general 2019-06-09 20:49:20 <@!194241218811658240>
general 2019-06-09 20:50:34 Compressed zip file will be sent out so another person can host it
Port forwarding is required
Maximum Players at a time : usually 50 (Nightly) and 100 (PubRel)
A Queue does not exist.... for some reason it breaks the game
general 2019-06-09 20:50:53 Problem:
Setting up a server WITHOUT mods takes about 3 hours
general 2019-06-09 20:51:01 We are using mods.
general 2019-06-09 20:51:32 Problem 2: I have to deal with circuitry and a surgery coming up so idk when im working on it
general 2019-06-09 20:51:45 Any other questions?
general 2019-06-09 20:53:16 we could hire a person with a server for $15 modless but im broke
general 2019-06-09 20:53:41 $15 monthly that is
general 2019-06-09 20:53:50 for PubRel
$20 for Nightly
general 2019-06-09 20:53:57 thats the cheapest i could find
general 2019-06-09 20:55:43 ping me if u need anything
general 2019-06-09 21:39:59 DMP now hosts career also
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 22:48:43 oh, that the only thing i havent landed a an 225 on and successfully taken back off of
creations-chat 2019-06-10 00:59:15 what if i like AND dislike?
and i dont have an opinion about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 06:19:15 that moment when u realize youve been typing an essay on Notepad and not Word
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:47:03 whatever action above carries to the person above and below me
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:47:57 but which "u"
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:48:18 there is no "u" in "whatever action above carries to the person above and below me"
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:50:13 is this what happens when im not home? is this the odd world the discord is when im not home
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:51:42 can u fill a bean... with beans?
general 2019-06-10 22:08:28 depends if i can set up career mode or not
general 2019-06-10 22:08:39 if not its defaulted as sandbox
general 2019-06-10 22:09:13 the pain of setting up mods is that i need a list of EVERY SINGLE mod part, and plugin for a txt file
general 2019-06-10 22:12:09 bc otherwise we'll have the mod but not be able to use it
general 2019-06-10 22:13:13 its kinda a pain, especially with a ksp forum page that has a part converter that recently went down (2 months ago)
general 2019-06-10 23:51:31 CoNfEtTi FaIrInGs
general 2019-06-10 23:55:39 and thats why i make roll cages whenever i test the cheats
general 2019-06-11 00:07:43 when RCS control goes down
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:59:41 hmm whats this
general 2019-06-11 01:02:17 this isnt ksp, i dont record ksp, but this is the cancer i have to deal with. just with 6 times more circuitry
and i know the NAND Implementation on a SSI is incorrect
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:02:56 hmm BAI
~~the only reason why i have a napoleonic uniform~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:04:08 oof, i only got half bc i mainly didnt give a damn about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:05:07 ehh... just something that happens and passes. not a big deal
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:05:48 even with the eggs i do have, i wont ever use them.. and prolly rarely change my avatar
bot-central 2019-06-11 01:08:52 !rank
bot-central 2019-06-11 01:08:58 hmm
general 2019-06-11 01:37:24 it tells you ur birthday
general 2019-06-11 01:37:26 one
general 2019-06-11 01:37:27 digit
general 2019-06-11 01:37:28 a

plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:38:25 HMM
general 2019-06-11 01:40:23 here lemme get a pic of the truth table, aka the paperwork... simplified to one page... of 4 pages
general 2019-06-11 01:42:23 HORRIBLE photo taken from an unfocused webcam bc im too poor to own a phone
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:43:25 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:44:01 dousing something or Do Use
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:44:48 and then you notice the player name
general 2019-06-11 01:47:34 if you want more information... its mislabelled.. its supposed to be 4.2.1 not 2.4.1 but its Combinational Logic Design: Date of Birth - AOI, NAND, and NOR SSI Implementation
general 2019-06-11 01:48:18 oh computer programming is next year
general 2019-06-11 01:48:35 im still in 10th grade
this is Digital Electronics
general 2019-06-11 01:48:58 very simplified version minus 5 major components
general 2019-06-11 01:49:11 thats from the pptx
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:51 i should knock out another inventor-esk thing but ill still procrastinate on it
but its just stuff similar to what is shown in <#497142796961054721> , because i know for a fact (i have some prototypes lying around) that logic gates can be made with unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:53:12 not nothing, but VERY few.
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:05 i never intended to get inventor but noone made a 16  segment display at the time so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:05 Anti, i live Southern Cali
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:22 ehh. its only humid
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:40 83.5F indoors isnt much
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:05:07 76% humidity.. not too bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:05:27 Go to cambodia. its worse there
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:06:19 Cambodia, Heat, and Humidity are three things that never go well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:06:41 Warm and Dry im fine with but not warm and humid
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:07:25 106 humid in shade is pretty much an average day for me now that ive visited relatives in cambodia
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:08:22 In Cambodia, if it rains. its at most 4 hours intervals. 3 days apart
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:15:51 registration date is this year HMM, few months ago
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:40:26 literally the simplest AOI OR Gate Implementation i could complete
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:40:29 
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:53:08 now to make an AND gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:53:50 bruh if rudimentary gates are this large, no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:54:28 ill probably hook this after a while to a rudimentary multiplexer
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:54:40 im on a 9 player server
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:58:02 this is the gate im currently working on, a rudimentary AND gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:05:43 SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:07:10 hmmm, i might join bc i havent fired a musket in roblox since a month ago so might as well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:08:59 VERY rudimentary 8 input AOI SSI circuit utilizing 6 rudimentary or gates and one rudimentary and gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:00 next step
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:08 NAND and NOT Gates
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:26 well, NAND NOT (Hex Inverters) and NOR
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:11:38 Also Am i the only one who prefers to use the Rifleman Class over others in BAI
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:11:50 Rifleman, Skirmisher. Same Concept
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:06 in the game the rifleman is under skirmishers so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:09 well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:11 some of em
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:47 yes, you did, scroll up
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:13:46 hmmmm. ~~i refuse to talk about aegon jsyk~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:14:13 ehh, raided him enough
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:15:13 I dont mind the reload for rifleman
i trained with it so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:15:59 oh wait, i wonder did they fix the bug in which for SOME CHARACTERS, IN EVERY GAME THE JOINED, they would lose their legs
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:16:39 why do i ask, i was a person that for some damn reason, never had legs. in which if i ever crounded i would fall under the map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:16:47 crouched*
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:17:33 the BAI community nicknamed me Sir Legless because of it, if u search the discord's archives
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:18:01 you cant find it under the phrase sir legless bc thats what they call me in game
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:18:07 not on the disc
creations-chat 2019-06-11 03:20:15 Flying BOX
general 2019-06-11 03:52:19 on some servers, this is why my name and icon doesnt exist
general 2019-06-11 03:52:46 im there, just not immediately noticable
general 2019-06-11 05:19:16 Heres the Birth Day Counter. ehh
general 2019-06-11 05:19:42 07-19-03
general 2019-06-11 05:23:11 you put the modules i think its named MechJeb (ARSomething)
It displays some stuff when u fly, and theres the ascent guidance, which is basically autopilot for your rocket to get into orbit
general 2019-06-11 05:23:56 Ascent Guidance hates SSTOs but theres another setting (idk what its called) that allows for it
general 2019-06-11 05:24:29 use atmosphere auto for ssto's it works better with sstos than mechjeb
general 2019-06-11 05:24:37 mechjeb ascent is for rockets
general 2019-06-11 05:25:23 the only few times i use ascent guidance is if im launching multiple station parts at the same time
general 2019-06-11 05:25:59 i think its [ and ]
thats what i use
general 2019-06-11 05:26:46 i mean with bd armory, just put a ai flight computer on it, fly in the pattern once, and the ai will follow that path until it detects another team
general 2019-06-11 05:27:23 i know this mainly because i had a war earlier this year
general 2019-06-11 05:27:42 sending the save file back and forth bc we had no server
general 2019-06-11 05:28:36 oof all my ssto's are named after predatory birds. but none of them are good in dogfights
general 2019-06-11 05:29:57 single stage to orbit
general 2019-06-11 05:30:03 space plane basically
general 2019-06-11 05:30:32 i have an ssto named DNHelVar
you know what thats for airliner?
general 2019-06-11 05:30:52 Its only mission is to get a HELICOPTER without oxidizer
general 2019-06-11 05:30:54 to duna
general 2019-06-11 05:31:15 ill get a pic next time i launch ksp
general 2019-06-11 05:31:27 i have a littlebird just on the north pole
general 2019-06-11 05:31:35 AirplanePlus
general 2019-06-11 05:32:02 for spaceplanes i use a mix of OPT and BDynamics
general 2019-06-11 05:32:13 the prop engines are BROKEN as hell
general 2019-06-11 05:32:29 ehh, i dont use PE often
general 2019-06-11 05:32:37 mainly cuz my pc is shit
general 2019-06-11 05:33:01 uhhh gimme a moment
general 2019-06-11 05:33:38 i dont have time to state the stats and all that but just look for a mgem2ll/a late 2014 mac mini
general 2019-06-11 05:33:44 i still use b9
general 2019-06-11 05:34:32 i agree, but then again i have a ssto thats literally two cargo bays a probe core and engines
general 2019-06-11 05:34:48 its my best ssto for SOME REASON
general 2019-06-11 05:35:36 all i need is oxidizer and JET ENGINES
general 2019-06-11 05:35:43 dont
general 2019-06-11 05:35:44 ask
general 2019-06-11 05:35:45 why
general 2019-06-11 05:36:24 i made it to minmus and back (with 5 oxidizer left) with only jet engines, lemme find that video file
general 2019-06-11 05:37:18 well. its 57MB so i cant upload it here. and i dont use youtube or anything as such so im might just compress it
general 2019-06-11 05:37:40 Need Money
general 2019-06-11 05:38:46 might get nitro just so i can pirate the games i have on discord... and upload size
general 2019-06-11 05:38:57 but then
general 2019-06-11 05:39:07 im too broke to boost or get nitro
general 2019-06-11 05:39:18 are you sure about that
general 2019-06-11 05:39:34 ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
general 2019-06-11 05:40:03 ik but still
general 2019-06-11 05:40:08 i have a mac mini
general 2019-06-11 05:40:12 but i run windows on it
general 2019-06-11 05:40:18 so i have a point in doing it
general 2019-06-11 05:40:39 
general 2019-06-11 05:40:45 it looks dusty
general 2019-06-11 05:40:47 but it isnt
general 2019-06-11 05:41:53 also because reasons
general 2019-06-11 05:42:26 also legendary if u scroll up u can find my birthdate counter
general 2019-06-11 05:42:41 ye but thats the easy part
general 2019-06-11 05:42:51 next
well. i have to solder it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 05:43:01 e
general 2019-06-11 05:43:11 thats gonna be cancer
general 2019-06-11 05:43:25 all for 204 test grade points
general 2019-06-11 05:43:51 yea, but graduating does
general 2019-06-11 05:44:12 to graduate at my school, you have to pass the pathway assessments. this is this year's pathway assessment
general 2019-06-11 05:44:40 and passing is 184-204 points
general 2019-06-11 05:45:01 ono
general 2019-06-11 05:45:28 hmmmm. SRB on helicopters...... and turn off air resistance..
general 2019-06-11 05:45:35 HGMMM
general 2019-06-11 05:46:10 actually, no. i have deadly reentry, that wont go so well
general 2019-06-11 05:50:36 ima get back to working on circuitry
general 2019-06-11 15:49:00 dont quesion it
general 2019-06-11 15:52:39 
general 2019-06-11 15:56:19 engine is on
general 2019-06-11 16:50:45 ***oxidizer***
general 2019-06-11 18:45:29 kiloseconds
general 2019-06-11 18:45:36 is now a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:52:46 o ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:30:58 what is going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:31:40 okay

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:41:11 i use watered down oreos. ~~i dont regret saying this~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:41:55 i dip my oreos into the molten plastic it came with
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:43:03 ~~an oreo emote~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:43:40 because water exists
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:44:21 what is that?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:44:36 minteos
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:45:02 minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:45:40 cave dig simulator
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:20:49 i might join u if i get bored of hw.
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:36:14 except it loops at the beginning and at the bottom. otherwise its literally a two.
general 2019-06-14 03:34:23 quicksaving and reverting flights. something i manually disable in the game files
general 2019-06-14 03:34:34 well. disabling the ability to do so
general 2019-06-14 03:34:53 as for the server im trying to work on it but surgery is tmw, and i was at a graduation
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 17:19:57 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 17:25:41 idk whats happening over there im just in my own area
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 19:33:15 i need mental help i used a fork to drink one cup of milk
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 19:54:46 i have the urge to make the object that Grab described.
general 2019-06-17 17:25:48 <@163143541160148992> im working on the server but at the same time i have ALOT of orthodontists appointments for removal of wisdom teeth and the jaw surgery
general 2019-06-17 17:26:09 and yes
school just finished on friday
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:40:46 just use a mac pro to support the mac pro
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:41:14 not that im rich enough to afford anything.
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:43:54 ree i have to transfer 14 GB of stuff to clear my flashdrive but its going at 14 bytes a second
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:45:20 its 32GB but tthis is old stuff that i dont need anymore
mostly Multisim and SOLIDWORKS/Inventor Files
bot-central 2019-06-19 02:19:35 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:21:25 tbh, i dont know what im building
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:22:16 all that i know is canopy
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:32:14 at first i was tryna build the F-16XL Laminar Flow Experiment aircraft but idek
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:42:31 also because reasons, gear bay doors
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:43:11 its just a motor and a 0.9 block
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:44:11 now heres the thing. i dont use first person often and besides i wont use first person until i can make another simulated hud
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:45:31 ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:45:43 such is the life of making compact ejector seats
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:46:31 id buy the jetpack but i dont play PC much anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:46:42 ill prolly buy it later
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:47:42 same, except it uses the player parachute physics
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:48:33 use springs
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:48:58 ehh, ive slowed down a video (i sadly do not have it anymore) the plane goes beneath the seat, meaning i technically dont impact the plane when ejecting
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:49:52 ehh, i keybind my spring to my parachute button
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:50:02 so it ejects and pulls the chute immediately
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:50:56 also that plane is a failure of this
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:52:33 wait hmmm
you said yours is a F-15?
then technically im building the plane that was beaten by the F-15 during the ETF competition
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:53:59 first sentence of wikipedia bc im too lazy to get an actual source
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:00 The General Dynamics F-16XL is a derivative of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, with a cranked-arrow delta wing. It was originally conceived as a technology demonstrator, later entered in the United States Air Force's (USAF) Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) competition but lost to the F-15E Strike Eagle.
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:07 bc it IS a f16
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:30 also its asymmetrical actually
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:42 the f16xl
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:46 
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:55:02 laminar flow experiments by nasa
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:55:25 lemme find a better pic
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:56:06 asymmetrical
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:57:42 OOF, apparently they also put the engine slightly off center.... TOWARDS the side with more weight
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:00:22 the F-15 only beat it becasue it was 300mph faster than the F16XL
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:00:29 both could carry the same payload
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:17:29 barrel-less armored fighting vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:19:50 i wont
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:21:15 yes we know trollers have cons
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:34:43 ngl, the mechanism xookdook1 is stating, can be seen in V0xel's Ka-52 gear retraction video
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:35:23 its a video. gifs are merely recorded videos on a loop
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:38:52 you can make logic gates via motors also, they arent that difficult to make
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:39:06 *unpowered motors*
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:40:50 wait do streamable links post in <#384025409945337856> cuz if they do, could you delete the following?
https://streamable.com/5rarl
my shitty compact landing gear
slightly more complex, poor video quality, but its the same concept. its a landing gear
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:41:25 im purposely trying NOT to get it into <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:42:02 lemme verify the links of this video brb
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:43:11 ree streamable decided to yeet my video into nonexistance

creations-chat 2019-06-19 23:42:30 if you think thats the first, put "box wing" into the discord search bar at the top right corner
creations-chat 2019-06-19 23:47:49 sorry =/
general 2019-06-20 00:30:47 reeeee, the mod list part file for the server got corrupted.... again. i have to start typing out each mod part ALL over again
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:42:09 hmm i caught stream at the right moment again. 6 minutes from landing
last time i was 2 minutes after soyuz's departure
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:44:21 bruh m60 with vcog full auto is better
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:53:39 USE A DAMN FULL AUTO M60 WITH A VCOG
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:53:59 the spread is ~~horrific~~ WONDERFUL
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:54:19 and like no joke. yes i snipe with the m60 vcog full auto
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:54:27 its actually quite effective
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:55:07 m60 is better (for me)
but colt lmg is good substitute until you get m60
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:45:58 you saw nothing battleship
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:46:20 100% didnt click universe by accident
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:55:23 BET
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:55:34 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:08 hmm. TOR didnt crash
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:12 ye
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:15 yet*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:23 thats why i dont use chrome
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:45 i use TOR
but then again i just want privacy but i still dont believe TOR gives complete privacy
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:57:39 ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:58:29 so what ur saying is i should launch BootCamp and switch to MacOSX?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:00:05 i could if i wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:14 i only use windows for 2 reasons
Multisim hates MacOS (Circuit Design Software)
SOLIDWORKS hates MacOS
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:43 tried. tbh. it made it worse
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:56 mac os is decent
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:03:17 and when i say multisim hates mac os, you cant get an installer for macosx multisim
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:07:32 i should buy the stand but not the monitor or anything. just the stand... for absolutely no reason even tho im broke
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:08:13 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:08:45 thats why i should buy the stand. and make myself in debt
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:11:21 become not bored
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:11:59 uhhhh
take CNC Mill lessons
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:12:36 or learn how to use a manual lathe
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:13:28 or uhhhhhh, study the factory stats of bending sheet metal
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:15:07 bruh why is it 87deg F at night still REE
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:16:07 i own too much air

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:06:20 so this is my first time using F3X... its shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:06:45 its actually shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:07:05 last i left i was 56

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:22:14 i dont know what colors/colours to give this. and how does the mesh tool work
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:23:47 nvm, i found it. you literally click the item and click the mesh tool
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:23:52 i cant import rblx id's
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:24:50 drag ur mouse over it <@!255361087262818304>
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:01 like how selection boxes work

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:26:16 nope apparently shift x is just delete
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:01:42 what im more concerned about is, why u eating dinner at 2PM PST

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:48:51 now*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:49:12 
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:50:01 all the parts are now starting to move around, like the polygon area of PC

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:53:29 the only missile name i can think of is Black Trident but it sound more like a fighter
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:54:21 trident is my interceptors name
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:54:52 the ship thats dying rn is a Mk.VI Medium Interceptor "Trident"

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:56:54 does that mean a 9y/o can become an anti aircraft projectile?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:57:21 so if i went to the airport, i would be arrested for bringing a small child correct?

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:09:47 hydra was here earlier (as well as another detailed builder that i forogt the name of)
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:15:53 ppl get detailed with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:16:49 is it unfair that im certified in the CSWA and CSWP?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:00 oh its kaiyon, i heard that theres a faction dispute going on rn
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:18 the liset?

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:54 i plan to remake the cantilever LIGHT freighter again
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:19:01 just to see how many ppl recognize it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:19:32 bruh i should make a corsair or some old plane in astrocraft for absolutely no reason
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:02:59 bruh i spent so long making this
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:03:08 i rly hate f3x sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:03:50 i prefer conventionals like solidworks not f3x, this is only the second time ive used f3x
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:04:32 bruh this is astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:46:58 World's shittiest bf-109
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:47:02 proportions are wrong
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:26 thought about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:31 but im busy rn'
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:49 but not to scale cuz the build limit
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:24:13 hey i talk most days
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:24:49 im just not well recognized bc all i did is cicuitry for inventing stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:08 this is what astrocraft's sun looks like if you drink the mango juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:40 we also managed to keep the effect of the mango juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:46 even after drinking it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:58 but it doesnt work if you reset
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:56:14 you drink strong juice, then mango, then die from strong juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:56:55 this is all i see
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:57:34 and this is the hub
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:21:43 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:29:11 dont ask why
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:29:27 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:30:04 why waste my time on astrocraft? im taking a small break from PC for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:35:56 yes, yes i did <@163143541160148992>

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:40:33 having background with 3d modelling helps, especially blender
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:42:32 dont worry my small engine took me like 1 hour 50 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:42:58 *without the blades, landing gear, bay doors or the back*
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 01:08:38 i need to learn how to use the surface motors ree

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:05 felt that from south of LA
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:42 it felt somewhat like a 6.8 where i was
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:50 but officially its 7.1
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:29:49 VI. Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.

VII. Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken.

VIII. Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned.

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:30:47 i can still feel the ground moving ever so slightly
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:31:23 ik but. if the shaking has been continuous for 15 minutes and going. is it an aftershock?

plane-crazy 2020-02-15 04:11:02 ono
general 2020-02-18 03:09:22 simple, you stop it and build it again
general 2020-02-19 00:10:22 apparently just API errors and latency
and sometimes messages repeating itself
general 2020-02-19 00:11:39 its gotten better, used to be a 36 second response time about 11 minutes ago
general 2020-02-19 00:12:51 im just stating what the website says
general 2020-02-21 07:47:09 ah yes, a recorded 17k ping according to shift f3
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:56:47 wing push air down, air push wing back after hitting ground
plane fly more
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:57:09 i mean, it doesnt have to be a plane but ehh
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:58:17 theres ALOT more but kinda yea
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:59:31 and some arent even planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 08:01:50 i shouldve phrased "air push wing back after hitting ground" better bc its more like the air is being displaced by the wing, and some of the air gets moved downwards; since this air has no place to go due to the ground existing, it attempts to push back up against the wing, giving more lift to the craft
general 2020-03-01 22:16:49 what the heck is ahppening here
general 2020-03-03 06:28:09 damn, we wont see what happens at 15000 hours

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:41:40 google works for finding blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:44:43 you google a blueprint, and you build it based on your knowledge of the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:45:30 literally just google a vehicle, then add the word blueprint after it
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:46:20 as for pre built structures? no, they simply do not exist
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:47:21 i dont think thats what he means by "type in blue print of (ur creation)"
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:48:44 im pretty sure its more like this
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:11 not saying ur making a stapler but still
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:26 (creation) blueprint also works for me
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:33 yea i prolly should
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:17 so i googled
fw190 blueprint
blueprint of fw190
they're almost identical
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:43 it just moves the images around
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:48 both ways work

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:54:10 oof
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:56:59 the only concern id have for making a stapler is making functional staples

plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:52:33 So random question
i want to access expert servers (and im aware you need an expert rank to do so...)
but if you check my ranks; i do indeed have Expert Aeronautical
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:53:10 How then, would i obtain access?
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:53:26 check bot central
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:53:29 i cant access them
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:53:36 ive tried
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:53:38 check the channel
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 00:54:03 tbh, id wait for a mod

plane-crazy 2020-08-22 01:02:13 although last year i couldve sworn i had those separators
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 01:06:03 it changed as of november last year?
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 01:06:25 if my memory servers me right
