general 2023-07-16 11:26:51 Hold on 
Thrust vectoring is a technology used in aircraft and rockets to control the direction of thrust produced by the engine. It involves changing the angle of the engine's exhaust nozzle to direct the thrust in different directions.

There are two main types of thrust vectoring: mechanical and fluidic. Mechanical thrust vectoring involves physically moving the engine nozzle to change the direction of the thrust, while fluidic thrust vectoring uses secondary airflows to deflect the exhaust flow.
