plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:06:20 Hey do you guys think they will add a space in plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:07:17 do you think there will be a new map and more items?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:07:33 they said they are already like 75 percent done
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:09:05 ayooo
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:09:54 one thing bad about the new one tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:10:13 the chance of it being free to play when its released is in the negatives
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:18:18 ayo when do you guys think pc2 is coming out?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:18:36 wait from now?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:19:29 mk
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:19:40 3 months ago he said he was 75 percent done

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:20:08 prob not tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:20:30 anyways

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:20:50 ture
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:20:51 true
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:22 what are you guys exited for, in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:36 Ye
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:21:45 Im exited for the inf map
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:23:13 It prob will come out 2-5 months from now
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:23:44 I hope its around 3 months from now
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:36 so uh
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:53 what do you hope they add?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:24:56 I hope they add space
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:18 I mena
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:21 mean*
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:25:42 There is gonna be an inf map so, what if they add a ton of players at different areas of the map, and have a minimap of sorts
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:04 wait you didnt know
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:11 rickje announced it 3 months ago
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:30 actually,
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:26:41 what if they added a radar, that would be sick
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:09 Tracking others in PVP, if there trying to sneak up for you
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:28 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:27:50 Wanna know what would actually be really cool? If when you shoot down or destroy an engine it explodes, same with fuel
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:28:28 Imagine if theres a hardcore option where damage is X2 and you have to use fuel
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:29:28 That would fit in a different gamemode, like pvp and not inf fuel, that would be fun
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:29:42 also
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:05 something that would make pvp so much better is allowing people to operate guns and other stuff while you drive
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:08 like imagine that
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:12 it would be so cool
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:30 Yet, sadly they wont be adding whitelisting..
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:52 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:30:54 they might
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:31:01 if they rework the whole system entirely
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:31:49 **OH FUCK WHAT IF THEY ADD BATTERYS**
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:18 god this would be terrifying if you were forced to use batterys AND fuel
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:32:54 Wanna know what would be insanely cool? Handheld guns
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:33:10 Imagine tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:33:23 It would take plane crazy to the next level
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:34:15 Ayo, imagine if they had a story gamemode, purchased from robux or something, that would be so fun
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:35:15 like imagine if you had like a story gamemode where you were tasked to fight npcs with the builds you create
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:36:12 Bro imagine if they had a tutorial that can teach you stuff about the game and not how to build one tiny plane ðŸ‘€
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:42:25 something that would be really cool is when you finish a build you would have a blueprint generated with it, and you can say a command or something saying like !Giveblueprint (Name) And then they could accept your blueprint or decline it, if they accept it so hologram of your build will showup and show them how to build it. Like the pc1 tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:49:22 I mean... Maybe it would be a gamepass for blueprints
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:49:41 and they would have like a 1k block limit
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 00:50:14 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 00:56:13 when yall think plane crazy 2 will come out?
