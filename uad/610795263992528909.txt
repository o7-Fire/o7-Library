help 2020-04-08 14:59:12 Okay thanks
general 2020-04-08 15:30:46 BIG HINT :  Use smaller blocks to defend your vehicle better , because big blocks will be destroyed in a single hit , small blocks however, there is more blocks which means only some a few blocks will get destroyed , while others will stay intact.

general 2020-07-17 10:43:07 if i add in blocks, it will be blocky
general 2020-07-17 10:43:32 and i actually need a decent aircraft for one
general 2020-07-17 10:47:02 ?
general 2020-07-17 10:47:05 Ill try it.

general 2020-07-17 10:47:25 i appreciate it
general 2020-07-17 11:03:05 
general 2020-07-17 11:03:11 looks like an F-111 advark
general 2020-07-17 11:03:34 also my folding system doesnt rlly work : it gets stuck a bit

general 2020-07-17 11:12:12 o k
general 2020-07-17 11:12:37 should i make this bit
general 2020-07-17 11:12:39 
general 2020-07-17 11:12:48 if i do, control surface will need to be in the middle of it
general 2020-07-17 11:12:51 and tail will be delta wing
general 2020-07-17 11:12:56 which makes some ugly holes
general 2020-07-17 11:19:11 Quick question
general 2020-07-17 11:19:20 shall i make custom landing retractable?
general 2020-07-17 11:19:22 or no?
general 2020-07-17 11:19:27 if its retractable it uses more space
general 2020-07-17 11:19:39 if it isnt, it doesnt use much space
general 2020-07-17 11:19:44 but it removes that feel of realism

general 2020-11-04 18:42:14 get warned
general 2020-11-04 18:42:43 > water isnt wet because its a fluid and has no defined area, gasses are also fluids, this means that gas cannot be wet either
> if you were to boil water and put a solid substance above the water, the solid would get wet due to the gas produced by the water boiling, this is condensation
> since water is contained in the gas this means that the gas can make the solid wet, however the gas isnt wet because it has no defined area.
