creations-chat 2022-12-24 02:29:58 This may be a really dumb question but how does one post an image of their creation in the creations channel? I cant paste screenshots there.
creations-chat 2022-12-24 02:34:05 Ok, thank you so much!

general 2022-12-24 02:55:17 I beg your pardon
general 2022-12-24 03:00:21 I wanna go home <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
general 2022-12-24 03:01:51 I just need to talk for like 5 more minutes and then I can get level 3 to post in creations channel
general 2022-12-24 03:03:47 fun
general 2022-12-24 03:05:41 I think that would hurt a little

general 2022-12-24 03:08:52 the fan will always be there for you
general 2022-12-24 03:14:44 reasonable
general 2022-12-24 03:22:34 you can laser things in half with an auto clicker
general 2022-12-24 03:24:26 as you do
general 2022-12-24 03:29:31 never
general 2022-12-24 03:33:35 my favorite activity
general 2022-12-24 03:35:36 it is slightly inconvenient that you have to be level 3 to post things in creations
bot-central 2022-12-24 03:38:16 !rank
general 2022-12-24 03:38:34 terrifying
general 2022-12-24 03:39:26 as you do
help 2022-12-26 02:24:21 hey usually how long does it take for mods or helpers to respond to a rank request?
help 2022-12-26 02:34:18 so if they dont respond in less than 24, your build is not worthy?
general 2022-12-29 22:40:23 at least I tried
general 2022-12-29 22:42:10 its not terrible for the third post I have ever made
general 2022-12-29 22:43:02 how many f22's have you made
general 2022-12-29 22:44:08 make flush doors that open and have functioning flares and then Ill listen to your opinion
general 2022-12-29 22:46:49 the f22 I made has side doors that are fairly flush and can open and launch out custom flares
general 2022-12-29 22:48:48 look I get it, im not great at making planes but you can chill with the toxicity
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:42:21 There's a video on how to do it but you have to go into the roblox game files and replace the skybox
