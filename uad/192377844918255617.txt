plane-crazy 2022-06-02 04:44:51 you didn't have at least 190 locked motors, you aren't permitted in this server and you will get downvoted like it's reddit
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 21:25:30 "planned release date this summer"
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 21:25:38 alpha hasn't happened yet
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:13:24 this game just straight up gaslit me

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:18:37 what's worse is there is no vaccine for this plague
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:18:38 it's like
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:18:41 a social plague
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:19:45 dawg one of my close friends posted questionable beastars pics in the gc as a "joke"... but with no context
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:20:58 the bc hats are limiteds now

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:22:22 obc was what
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:22:35 that was a $20 hat
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:23:22 i kept using bypassed clothing (nothing inappropriate, just stuff not fit for roblox) and i got refunded everything

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:01 i'm not getting a btr5 with hd600s
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:07 too expensive and not portable
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:33 dawg i already have expensive headphones that i got for a fantastic price
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:39 and i'm not getting iems
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:40 ew
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:42 no sound stage
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:27:51 it feels like it's in your head
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:28:31 yeah but 1000xm4 have a bit of soundstage, decent profile, portability, wired support, good clamping force, and are comfortable
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:28:37 iems are sweaty and fall out of my ears
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:28:49 over-ears don't depend on the shape of your ear
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:28:58 well here
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:29:00 i haven't had IEMS
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:29:07 but i've had in-ear headphones
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:29:19 i have consumer-grade JBL in ears
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:29:28 hence why i wear contacts
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:30:02 me when <#384021699466756107> turns into #audiophile <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:30:26 i know a guy with a btr5
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:30:32 it makes cheapass headphones sound decent
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:30:37 it's like magic bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:30:54 fr
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:31:38 zs10 fr

plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:32:18 he also had hd600s that he just had in his backpack
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:32:26 ong those eggs fry great
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:32:50 still sounds nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:32:53 balanced isn't everything
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:33:08 though imo too v-shaped makes it feel like someone is sucking on my ears
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:33:12 and not in a good way
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:33:53 same
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:34:15 just spared the last bit of hobby money on new switches
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:34:55 hedephon
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:35:08 nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:35:16 mine are $350 (but not worth it)
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:35:22 i got mine for $70 so worth it but
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:01 thats how the 1000xm4 was like in best buy
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:04 was crazy bru
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:12 my headphones are JBL CLUB ONE
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:16 the noise cancelling sucks
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:44 oh nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:36:51 if you have solder skills you could custom one
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:37:06 oh sick
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:37:13 this is what happens when you have money i guess
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:37:24 jealous
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:38:07 these ones dont even clamp on my head right, and they have very little clamping force anyway
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:38:12 so the noise cancelling is poop
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:38:43 nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:38:55 my backup headphones are jbl live 300tws if i remember right
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:39:42 dawg these headphones
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:39:51 at like 40hz you can hear artifacts in the sound
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 17:39:54 like weird popping
