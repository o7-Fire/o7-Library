bug-reports 2022-03-13 03:47:25 I hopped on to fly my heli today and my speakers would t play. I tried changing the code and on my other builds, but it didn’t fix it
general 2022-03-13 03:55:45 Is there a place to make suggestions
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 03:06:31 Dang how did you get those sight things
bot-central 2022-03-14 03:08:02 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 03:16:36 Did you just use colored text blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 03:16:58 Ok thanks
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 04:08:46 Looks like you could use some helium blocks near the front it’s dipping down in straight flight
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 04:13:36 When your flying straight you nose goes down and you lose altitude and straight flight. Fix this with helium and if it goes to high add ballast with the right mass and it should fly perfectly straight
