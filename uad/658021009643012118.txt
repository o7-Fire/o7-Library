general 2021-02-28 23:41:52 hi
help 2021-03-03 18:01:29 hello does anyone know how to avoid that with motors 2 stop moving crazily?
help 2021-03-03 18:03:14 I am trying to create a 5-blade heli rotor.
help 2021-03-03 18:04:03 I was testing and that when I put less wing panels on it it stopped moving and started to be normal
help 2021-03-03 18:05:34 And do you know why they do that? because of the torque angle or is it a bug?
help 2021-03-03 18:11:11 Oh well, then it is confirmed that it is a bug, I guess they will fix it, thank you very much for the help :)

creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:01:32 14? you are confused, I put a cylinder on each side to make it look more "realistic". Do you understand?

creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:28:24 Ok, nice joke? I'm just saying that I don't dedicate as much time to the game as others, that's why my constructions are not as good, and let's say I'm not an "expert". and yes im a noob

help 2021-04-27 01:11:43 Yo, some know if i can make motor lock whit motor 2?
help 2021-04-27 01:13:34 With the normal motor it is not precise and with motor 2 it does not work directly. :/ Does anyone know if something can be done?
help 2021-04-27 01:15:06 Motor 2
help 2021-04-27 01:17:07 And normal motor, That line is very difficult to remove if you put it even the slightest bit wrong.
help 2021-04-27 01:38:22 yooo, thanks u!
help 2021-04-27 01:38:34 Very good idea thank you very much
help 2021-04-27 02:30:12 I made this system of angles, you just move the motor and it stays in the angle, now so that the cameras do not bother you can remove them with a disconnector, but with the spring nozzle leaves no trace, it is very basic I guess but I highly recommend it :D
help 2021-05-15 22:52:55 â­•  ðŸ”˜  ðŸ”´
help 2021-05-15 22:56:48 Does anyone know how to make the motors 2 not move "madly"?

help 2021-05-30 17:47:51 How can I make my rotor more stable, so that it doesn't go sideways, I don't know if I understand?
help 2021-05-30 17:54:46 Wut?
help 2021-05-30 17:54:57 Aaaahhhhh
help 2021-05-30 17:55:03 Yes
help 2021-05-30 17:55:56 I know that if I put another rotor on top of that one but in the opposite direction it will not happen, but I know that it can be avoided
help 2021-05-30 17:56:31 and is rolling to the left
help 2021-05-30 17:57:54 yes sir
help 2021-05-30 17:58:01 sorry if my English is bad
help 2021-05-30 17:58:44 It is behind the rotor but I reduced it with a balast block.
help 2021-05-30 17:59:38 Nope,it is turning to the left I guess because of the "lift", but I don't know how to control it.
help 2021-05-30 18:00:30 i can add u?
help 2021-05-30 18:00:54 Only if you want
