creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:40:43 its a really good motorlocked creation but, it doesnt look good...
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:43:25 why? just why the need to say that?
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:45:30 sorry personally i don't like the nose cone at all. its looks really good, probably took a lot of time to make. i just don't like the look of it. and also just cause i have aeronautical 1 doesn't mean i cant have a opinion.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:47:32 KV-1? if so i like it a lot.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:49:35 you could try and make the barrel a bit more detailed... or maybe add tracks. but i think you should keep it the way it is
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:55:01 i guess i just dont like the saab my friend. i dont like the look of it. But im not saying its not good cuz i can tell that took some time and effort. it is good just in my opinion it looks bad
creations-chat 2021-04-17 16:57:41 nice. but if you were gonna do something. i would like it a bit more if you fixed the nose. the half ball on the front is kinda annoying lmao.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 17:00:26 aight.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 17:02:31 change it back. the turret looks to thin now.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 20:01:01 i dont remember any rocket using helium ever, but thats just me. idk if thats even a rocket. looks like a flying black rod.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 20:04:38 you see how you said BEFORE it takes off? it doesn't use it to fly....<:Mhm:551152556324159488>. It also looks bad.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 20:06:40 well then try better. that simple
creations-chat 2021-04-17 20:11:01 lol
creations-chat 2021-04-17 20:47:20 anything i should change/ do? this is for the competition btw. more pics on the way

creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:01:30 My ta-152, any suggestions before i do anything else?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:05:42 bruh like more specific?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:07:44 i meant something helpful for improvement to the aircraft, not just to get rid of it...
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:13:42 ok, thanks for some actual feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:18:05 holy shit
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:51:05 Ta-152, Done the body im about to do the wings. any thoughts about what i should add or take away?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:53:52 another angle
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:21:11 its an emu
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:25:17 is this better? i think so
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:07:31 My Ta-152, anything i should change or add?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:10:41 why do you have to be like that. ive sent hours on this and you just have to be toxic like that? im even looking for some advice to improve and you say that.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:13:28 bruh really? "Im NoT TrYINg to bE ToxIC"
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:17:26 Mr.bigshot over here thinking hes better than everyone and has the right to say whatever the hell he wants with no concern for the others feelings. Ya know, you could have said something like "fix the nose" or "improve the tail". but know you just say "delete it". and you really said "im not trying to be toxic." all you are is a 23 year old man still living in his moms basement that gets a kick outta bullying kids.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:19:38 there is absolutely no need for that at all. never said i was better than him, stop being toxic.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:22:18 well if he is then how bout instead of him being toxic, he could maybe try and give some advice or help to the less experienced. like a decent human being
creations-chat 2021-07-06 17:25:22 Ur a piece of shit.
creations-chat 2021-07-27 21:25:16 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-07-27 21:27:29 i think ur right <:hahaa:773727260539617280>, just a worse one. Very similar
creations-chat 2021-07-27 21:29:38 <:nooo:787097964946259978>, its garbage. makes my eyes hurt, wouldn't you agree?
creations-chat 2021-07-27 21:34:01 if thats better than the other one, i might die from disgust.
creations-chat 2021-07-27 21:48:21 its nice
creations-chat 2022-01-22 23:11:04 I just finished my Panzer IV/70(V) chassis, anything i should improve/remove?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 23:13:08 I haven't added them yet. Before I did I wanted some feedback on it.
