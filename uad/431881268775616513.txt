creations-chat 2021-07-18 20:35:33 looks very good. The only thing i don't really like is the lack of colour, it's all rally one shade of grey. Why not mix it up a bit?

REPLY: <@456226577798135808> Well it's clearly a boat, so why not make the bottom a hint of green to indicate moss growth or a darker shade? or even make some patches of darker grey to indicate repairs from bullet holes or something.
creations-chat 2021-07-18 20:43:44 great! but you should add some detail to the door/gate . remember this thing's been trough heck and back also you should make the seats a different color so people can see them better.
creations-chat 2021-07-18 20:58:31 tbh the  bulletholes look more like spots, i was thinking more rust, some moss and the gunholes should be black

help 2021-09-10 14:58:30 for the front part
help 2021-09-10 14:59:01 basically
help 2021-09-10 14:59:05 can paint every side of the block
help 2021-09-10 14:59:11 a different colour
help 2021-09-10 14:59:26 but does not apply with materials doe
help 2021-09-10 14:59:31 which is stoopid

help 2021-09-10 15:00:36 not the easter egg
help 2021-09-10 15:00:54 also wdym 'fix the wings', like what's wrong with it?
help 2021-09-10 15:01:10 control surfaces
help 2021-09-10 15:01:15 too chunky
help 2021-09-10 15:01:24 want it to be as sleek as possible
help 2021-09-10 15:01:32 i am using those
help 2021-09-10 15:02:14 üò¶
help 2021-09-10 15:07:57 why ping
help 2021-09-10 15:08:04 oh yeah
help 2021-09-10 15:08:08 yeah looks good
help 2021-09-10 15:08:11 but should add
help 2021-09-10 15:08:20 some half wedge 2's on the sides
help 2021-09-10 15:08:34 so it more round
help 2021-09-10 15:14:36 i think it looks great
help 2021-09-10 15:15:04 just finish the build and then evaluate the flaws
help 2021-09-10 15:30:04 motorlock i guess
help 2021-09-10 15:30:09 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
help 2021-09-10 15:31:22 added custom control surfaces
help 2021-09-10 15:35:13 i'll try, i dont have much space
help 2021-09-10 15:35:32 ok
help 2021-09-10 15:37:36 the thing is, i dont have any space for a motor lock tower.
help 2021-09-10 15:38:29 yeah.
help 2021-09-10 15:38:52 yeah.
help 2021-09-10 15:38:57 maybe i could.
help 2021-09-10 15:39:06 let me try.
help 2021-09-10 15:54:45 vertical meaning the side ones right?
help 2021-09-10 15:54:50 or the top one?
help 2021-09-10 15:56:05 ok
help 2021-09-10 15:56:14 step 1 : remove it
help 2021-09-10 15:56:25 step 2: add half blocks wehre it was
help 2021-09-10 15:56:46 step 3: remake the stabilizer ontop fo the half blocks
help 2021-09-10 15:57:05 step 4: remove a half block under the stabiliser and set it to motorlock
help 2021-09-10 15:57:22 should make it less of an eyesore
help 2021-09-10 16:01:24 so i've managed to make it flush wit the side of the plane, but i cant quite figure out how i'm going to pull it flush with the control surface.
help 2021-09-10 16:01:42 
help 2021-09-10 16:02:26 i've literally never done any motorlock towers on planes so bare with me.
help 2021-09-10 16:03:46 better.
help 2021-09-10 16:03:52 yeah
help 2021-09-10 16:03:58 kinda chonky
help 2021-09-10 16:04:09 but it has some potential
help 2021-09-10 16:06:36 maybe with the wings it'll kinda even out
help 2021-09-10 16:06:47 one's powered and one's ain't.
help 2021-09-10 16:07:13 yes
help 2021-09-10 16:07:19 and unpowered it a fake motor
help 2021-09-10 16:07:25 because it looks similar to a motor
help 2021-09-10 16:07:28 if you colour it
help 2021-09-10 16:07:49 or the back of the plane
help 2021-09-10 16:07:50 if it's easier
help 2021-09-10 16:08:30 something happened
help 2021-09-10 16:08:35 
help 2021-09-10 16:09:11 i think it's good
help 2021-09-10 16:09:24 but something's clearly **ruh roh**
help 2021-09-10 16:11:02 
help 2021-09-10 16:11:19 the cockpit actually starts before the air intake
help 2021-09-10 16:11:41 literally the middle of the plane he means.
help 2021-09-10 16:11:46 look at the real photo
help 2021-09-10 16:11:53 it's a **long boy**
help 2021-09-10 16:12:59 yeah
help 2021-09-10 16:14:47 so about my motorlocking
help 2021-09-10 16:14:55 do you have an idea what i did wrong?
help 2021-09-10 16:15:16 
help 2021-09-10 16:16:11 wdym
help 2021-09-10 16:17:06 that's just the bottom of the plane i hollowed out
help 2021-09-10 16:17:09 for it to fit
help 2021-09-10 16:17:15 but i'll try something
help 2021-09-10 16:18:53 i dont think it even matters because they're both even
help 2021-09-10 16:22:48 what difference does it make?
help 2021-09-10 16:23:31 
help 2021-09-10 16:23:47 like that's better than how it was before
help 2021-09-10 16:24:23 i dont need to make the control surfaces flush
help 2021-09-10 16:24:33 i'll do something else

help 2021-09-11 10:47:09 helium, wing panels disguised in the walls, balanced thrusters
help 2021-09-11 11:08:06 less stable imo

creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:51:08 because is funky.

creations-chat 2021-09-11 15:13:01 no? 
let me post a pic
creations-chat 2021-09-11 15:15:27 motorlock 
yes just because i used the same rotor and back antenna its a copy, besides the wings are not the same, the only thing i copied was the cockpit. and even that i added my own twist to it.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 15:18:49 by all means join my game and you'll see how much of a 'copy' mine is.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 15:21:59 the only thing i admit i copied was the cockpit and the nose.
the-dump 2021-09-11 19:56:02 dude's copying my build and making a yt vid outta it. (I blacklisted him and turned on anti copy blacklist)
the-dump 2021-09-11 19:58:00 that.
the-dump 2021-09-11 19:59:18 yeah
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:00:23 that burger looked good ngl., if the bun was cleaner.
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:00:32 and it had ketchup on it
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:00:36 and cheese
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:00:45 maybe it'd be like some kfc burger
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:00:52 or maybe i'm high sleep deprived again
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:01:02 and without the trollface
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:01:13 i'd imagine it as a small piece of paper on a toothpick
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:01:17 ontop of the burger
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:01:20 holding it together
the-dump 2021-09-11 20:09:13 looking kinda tasty, without the troll face ofc.

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:09:15 i can agree on that fully. also, like when i first started to play plane crazy half of my save files were vulpen tutorials, now i'm building my own versions of them.
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:13:19 he enjoys making tutorials that actually teach people to build rather than copying every single block of a build, and i like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:15:39 regular day flying over the ocean, nothing strange.
