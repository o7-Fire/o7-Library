creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:10:15 hence the name "BO A  T"
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:11:22 obsessed with that thing?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:12:30 > Boat doesnt have any words relating to water inside of it, meaning if you didnt know what a boat was and heard the word, you’d have no idea what it was. So your hence the name comment makes no sense
<@456226577798135808> lmfao have you ever seen boats that goes on land (besides amphibious vehicles)?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:13:08 then what's your point? i aint reading that damn essay

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:17:31 the word "boat" actually means something so it isn't the name itself that plays a role. A boat means a water vehicle that is used for military and or civillian purpose
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:19:06 well who doesn't know the word "boat"? in this entire server?

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:34:50 > You shouldn’t say that as if you’ve won something, if you can’t relate those sentences I’m convinced a chicken learned to type
<@456226577798135808> i didn't say that like i won something

bug-reports 2020-10-06 23:52:57 > So i have experienced this bug before, it is VERY annoying, it happens with signs and text throughout the whole build, so in my case i am building the H-4 Hercules, and i was putting the tail registration number on (NX37602) When doing so, i found that *NX* was tagged, i easily got around this by typing *N X*. when i moved the *N X* to the tail of the plane, it tagged, it also tagged on the other original text. It put a stricter chat filter on the signs and text than before and theres no way to reverse or get around this.

creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:39:43 > It has downvotes cuz its kinda not good for a creation of that size
<@!588596347272167456> i dont know it looks pretty good to me
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:40:06 there's literally nothing more to add to the paris class

creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:43:32 > there is literally a community in communities for space things
<@!447221768520859659> yes there is and its inactive ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:43:57 > Well, this communities standards have dropped so much since when i joined, back in the day my 109 would have been lucky to get 20 upvotes, and your arguing over a couple downvotes?
<@!588596347272167456> Not arguing but yes standards have dropped sadly
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:44:26 to the point where shit builds could get 60-70 likes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:14 > If a boeing 747 can carry a space shuttle, why cant it carry overfull luggage?
<@!712243348639055913> im not answering this
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:31 > Its because of the huge amount of braindead idiots who dont know what a good build is bcuz they cant build well themselves
<@!588596347272167456> EXACTLY.... EXACTLY
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:47:24 yeah..... People spend hours on some build. And yet they couldnt get pass 50 likes (not all but mostly) and **SHIT**  Builds could get SHIT tons of LIKES
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:49:19 > Well, the og people left bcuz upvotes have no merit anymore, they are guarenteed upcotes if they post something even just average, the new people just upvote everything and its basically ruining the premise of creations
<@!588596347272167456> you dont need to post something that's average. Shitbuilds could get tons of likes (20 block builds)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:49:49 lmfao
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:50:15 > i doubt the og people left from upvotes, they probably left because they're tired of pcc or pc
<@!447221768520859659> they're tired of having unders coming to the server basically acting toxic like what happened to guggi
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:50:57 he left the server cause some kids decided it would be funny to bully him (probably just annoyed rather than mad)

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:00:38 the map preview is almost done
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:01:06 it should be done on january or faster
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:01:26 lmfao yes  the runway is too short too
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:01:42 rens has it. its nearly done
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:03:25 maybe multiple airports would be cool
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:03:41 > What if rick added weather
<@!615810446724694018> and wind<:PogU:670373666164572172>
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:05:47 not that he cant. Making wedges is hard. according to rick, it takes a few hours to make a single wedge. He's currently trying to make the game sorta softcoded for easier additions like said wedges
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:06:10 > Rickje said he will never add a bigger plot
<@!683069192143896594> that would change soon idk when
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:06:43 maybe plane crazy 2?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:07:09 > 2.1k lines of code for motors<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
<@!447221768520859659> see? imagine wedges. a single wedge type has 4 sizes.
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:07:28 > we would lose all of our progress if rick makes a new game
<@!447221768520859659> idc tbh, a better game would be better game i'd risk my savedata for a better game and who knows maybe he could implement savedata in the new game
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:09 thats easy to make
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:29 > Well i mean how hard can it be to make a wedge, you take the 1x1 and extend it  and then take the hitbox and stretch it
<@!588596347272167456> that part is easy, the coding is harder
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:56 you gotta account for paint, rotation X Y Z axis
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:09:20 which would be a pain to code according to rick (no im not a coder_
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:09:59 > and movment and destruction
<@!615810446724694018> exactly. Now imagine doing that on 3 types of wedges with 4 diffrent sizes. thats 12 items being coded
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:10:19 > Its his own fualt in the first place
<@!588596347272167456> well maybe he wasnt expecting the game to blow up like this
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:11:24 softcoding is easier said than done expecially for rick
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:12:31 > <@!582834773773254656> From my experience, soft coding is basically how organized your code is. If your code isn't organized, thigns can break easily
<@!615810446724694018> yes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:16:23 My country sux. Education is wack as fuck
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:16:44 no
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:17:09 indonesia
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:17:44 where budget for books are effected by corruptions. So basically we get some shit quality books
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:18:01 like till the point where the paper isn't white no more

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:11 while those aussies are giving away free laptops, our country wont even give free books goddamit
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:39 7.00-12.00 for me
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:59 > huh never realised how fortunate I am
<@!615810446724694018> you might be really fortunate. my country may be bad at education but not my school
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:21:39 so basically the students in my country including my school gets oppressed by the amount of burden they put on us
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:22:16 and my school is really tough. Like till the point where the min score is 78 and gettign 85 is FUCKING hard
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:23:39 > you guys get opressed , at top schools in my country they get a average of 3 pages of homework at every class
<@!672135256958173225> mine's not homework frankly its the amount of shit lessons they cram into your head
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:24:56 especially when on finals where we gotta study shitloads of shit (2 tests per day) for 8 days. so basically its like hell week but for your brain
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:25:29 > the worst thing is, in some countries, the government makes profit of expensive health care. Basically making money off lives being lost
<@!615810446724694018> America....
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:25:52 we get cheap healthcare here. Well compared to america that is
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:26:59 > my school fights other school lmao
<@456226577798135808> my school wouldnt dare do that but some other schools would assault other schools with machettes and *Clurit* a traditional weapon go look it up
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:27:48 not mine but others yes they act kinda wild sometimes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:28:26 my school has educated students (polite) compared to other schools since my school is a catholic one
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:28:58 so for god's sake we wouldnt assault other schools since our uh religion is minor compared to the other religion (muslims) we would be murdered and we mostly chinese  indonesians so we should watch ourselves or else discrimination is visible but invisible to tourists
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:31:22 > <@456226577798135808> That kid is messed up

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 01:53:34 or
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 01:53:44 reduce the lift
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 01:53:54 by making the angle on the motor 2s lower
general 2020-10-26 01:56:14 isn't he always
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 01:56:27 the one that tilts the blades?
general 2020-10-26 01:56:42 yes

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:04:09 then post the link here
general 2020-10-26 02:10:05 wooman
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:10:47 top needs to go 2x as fast as the bottom one
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:00 > the top has to be twice the speed, doesnt that make coaxial helicopters super inefficient
<@!489910972946055172> it makes it efficient
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:03 lift is greater
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:07 and offers better stability
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:27 what
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:32 we odnt have fuel in pc
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:37 unless if you wanna use it
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:50 its
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:11:51 gay
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:01 well this isnt real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:08 ofc
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:21 > what can i use as a equalizer for going down when it goes foward
<@!404539659440488468> wing panels on the front side
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:12:36 so it generates lift when moving forward
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:03 make it hidden
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:49 he tilts forward too much i suppose
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:13:57 well DUH
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:36 well yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:49 you gotta have a stupid advanced swashplate to do so
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:14:54 or else it wont work
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:15 yeah its kinda odd
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:19 sometimes it shakes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:23 and sometimes it doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:15:30 try playing with torque
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:16:27 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:16:32 drag is stupid high
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:08 idk
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:10 up to u
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:17:52 increases acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:18:03 and yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:18:06 increases power
general 2020-10-26 02:18:37 2 shots of codka
general 2020-10-26 02:18:39 vodka
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:00 dont worry about torque too much
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:06 it isnt relevant yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:19:16 yeah

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:22:51 unresponsive controls?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:23:06 isnt agile?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:23:21 add super rocket engines at the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:23:33 so it could be triggered and lift your heli up
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:23:53 go up
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:05 i suppose
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:14 oooh
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:19 you wanna recover from a dive?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:28 then put rocket engines on the front
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:40 or
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:40 so you could trigger them and make you pull up faster
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:52 you could use those tail wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:24:57 and make them act as eleveators
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:25:30 so you could use them to pull up faster
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:26:02 np
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:26:14 my first heli was worse than yours lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 02:26:18 ka 50 shit thing

general 2020-12-04 01:41:52 roblox server bad?
general 2020-12-04 01:42:08 you know that general isn't for shitposting?
general 2020-12-04 01:42:24 idgaf
general 2020-12-04 01:42:55 seriously
general 2020-12-04 01:43:02 is the roblox website okay?
general 2020-12-04 01:43:24 rick cant even make magnets that latch to eachother lol
general 2020-12-04 01:44:46 yeah as if
general 2020-12-04 01:45:09 *lag intensifies*
general 2020-12-04 01:47:27 you know that thing's not gonna happen?
general 2020-12-04 01:47:45 like it's impossible with the current roblox engine
general 2020-12-04 01:48:04 take ultimate driving for an example
general 2020-12-04 01:48:18 that giant of a map takes a shitload of processing power
general 2020-12-04 01:48:30 did you detail it?
general 2020-12-04 01:48:49 you make flat things
general 2020-12-04 01:49:07 same as earth
general 2020-12-04 01:49:24 a sphere so big that "flat" has almost 0 degrees curve
general 2020-12-04 01:49:59 that could work, but the sphere must be big. Or else the curve would be noticable
general 2020-12-04 01:50:07 really big
general 2020-12-04 01:50:17 roblox doesn't like big things
general 2020-12-04 01:50:42 especially a sphere with trees, sea, orbital mechanics, and all of those thingamajigs
general 2020-12-04 01:51:01 so yes i'd say it's impossible for the time being
general 2020-12-04 01:51:07 the lag would be insane
general 2020-12-04 01:51:15 yeah right
general 2020-12-04 01:51:41 ^
general 2020-12-04 01:54:13 yeah that sphere that he made
general 2020-12-04 01:54:30 it has to be like 30X bigger
general 2020-12-04 01:54:37 maybe more
general 2020-12-04 01:54:57 100X may be possible

the-dump 2020-12-13 12:48:01 Tis true my form is something odd.
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew,
I would not fail in pleasing you.
If I could reach from pole to pole,
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul,
The mind's the standard of the man.

general 2021-01-08 08:53:32 Tis true my form is something odd.
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew,
I would not fail in pleasing you.
If I could reach from pole to pole,
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul,
The mind's the standard of the man.

general 2021-01-25 09:21:16 Idk
general 2021-01-25 09:21:18 That's simple
general 2021-01-25 09:21:24 But a swashplate is hard
general 2021-01-25 09:21:32 Idfk how to do it tbh
general 2021-01-25 09:21:38 I don't do mechanisms
general 2021-01-25 09:21:45 I do fuselage design
general 2021-01-25 09:22:17 No they aint
general 2021-01-25 09:22:20 I made a few
general 2021-01-25 09:22:39 It's pretty easy to make coaxial helos
general 2021-01-25 09:22:47 The non coaxial ones are
general 2021-01-25 09:22:49 Shitt
general 2021-01-25 09:22:52 Hard to make

general 2021-01-25 09:25:05 Ofc
general 2021-01-25 09:25:21 Did you expect to  make a non coaxial one with  little to no experience?
general 2021-01-25 09:25:34 Even some of my friends who have a ton experience can't even make it
general 2021-01-25 09:26:53 Top rotor must spin twice as fast as the bottom one

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:35 20 studs is  a metre?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:44 dunno man
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:54 that would only work in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:19 cause a 400 stud snipe in phantom forces feels far
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:50 then 400 studs will be 3 meters

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:59:42 or
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:59:42 robloxians are usuallt 2 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:59:46 5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:59:57 assuming robloxians are tall af
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:00 like 2 meters
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:11 we could conclude that a meter is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:26 which sounds more reasonable than 1/20th of a meter is a stud

plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:36:54 battlecruisers are literally
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:36:58 Its own class
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:38:29 But they are on a different class
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:38:36 But if i were to classify them
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:38:41 I'd classify them as battleships
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:39:06 Since battlecruisers have similar displacement and firepower
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:30 Battlecruisers are a lighter version of battleships

general 2021-04-19 07:03:33 When barrel rotates
general 2021-04-19 07:03:39 The rocket launcher gains speed
general 2021-04-19 07:03:56 Just like when you go 1k speed and launch missiles they dont go backwards
general 2021-04-19 07:04:05 mechanics
general 2021-04-19 07:04:07 Like
general 2021-04-19 07:04:12 When you go 1k with a plane
general 2021-04-19 07:04:15 and launce a rocket
general 2021-04-19 07:04:20 it goes faster yes?
general 2021-04-19 07:04:38 he does the same thing here but with sideways speed
general 2021-04-19 07:04:43 witht he same results
general 2021-04-19 07:05:01 Yes
general 2021-04-19 07:05:13 If not then your missiles would lag behind you when you shoot it at 1k sps

help 2021-04-21 01:11:56 But you don't really need to use motorlock to make a good looking build
help 2021-04-21 01:12:05 For example
help 2021-04-21 01:12:09 Rbk doesn't use motorlock
help 2021-04-21 01:12:18 And he ended up in HOF
help 2021-04-21 01:12:37 thats on you
help 2021-04-21 01:12:46 then you can't
help 2021-04-21 01:12:48 Simple
help 2021-04-21 01:12:59 If you want to build small stuff, motorlocking is a must
help 2021-04-21 01:13:08 Or else it'll end up looking down bad

help 2021-04-21 01:18:57 set
help 2021-04-21 01:19:16 you wont build anything with 6 hours spent with motorlock
help 2021-04-21 01:19:26 12 is the minimum if you wanna build something good
help 2021-04-21 01:19:49 i spent like 6 hours on my mech and only got the cockpit

creations-chat 2021-04-22 10:35:14 Eh you can do that later on when you have free time, btw coloring the canopy with another color to give it a "frame" makes it kinda look worse, so you might want to consider the idea of motorlocking wing panels into the canopy

creations-chat 2021-04-22 10:44:28 First of all, I''m gonna say what i usually say, 

1. Desaturate the brown
2. Give the walls some texture and a different color ofc
3. Remake the stairs, it's bland
4. Behind the cactus, i can see a gray wall, it would be nice if you'd add some other colors and add texture to the walls

creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:01:57 Yeah i think he's got a point, shaders add depth which I also usually do on my creations

Probably what he means is to add shaders to further emphasize the in game shaders since there is almost no actual shading in game
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:04:15 You should try a less saturated blue as the accent, a few shades of white to give it some depth. And yes as for now it kinda looks like a white blob lmao

the-dump 2021-07-03 09:21:28 if you're trans then

general 2021-07-22 05:32:17 though i could make it turn longer
general 2021-07-22 05:32:22 but i dont like

general 2021-07-22 05:34:15 yeah
general 2021-07-22 05:34:24 i could adjust the angle to like 5 degrees
general 2021-07-22 05:34:29 and have no turn at all
general 2021-07-22 05:34:44 i am aerodynamics <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-07-22 05:34:58 doesnt apply to plane crazy though
general 2021-07-22 05:35:33 drag decreases at a certain altitude
general 2021-07-22 05:35:42 perhaps rick could add that
general 2021-07-22 05:35:52 the wings have drag
general 2021-07-22 05:36:06 alter the variable after it passes a certain altitude
general 2021-07-22 05:36:12 yeah thats the point
general 2021-07-22 05:36:22 thats why unrealistic shit planes exist
general 2021-07-22 05:36:35 2000- 0 in a second
general 2021-07-22 05:36:51 yeah
general 2021-07-22 05:37:17 wait what
general 2021-07-22 05:37:29 less lift= slower?
general 2021-07-22 05:37:33 isn't it the opposite?

general 2021-07-22 05:39:18 i'll do it cause its fun
general 2021-07-22 05:39:35 i mean if you put it that way
general 2021-07-22 05:40:34 i think the best way to simulate sorta realistic drag is to use a miniscule amount of wing panels to make your plane fly
general 2021-07-22 05:40:49 "sorta"
general 2021-07-22 05:41:11 thats where my motorlock comes into play
general 2021-07-22 05:41:29 i make it seemless
general 2021-07-22 05:41:30 so yeah

creations-chat 2021-07-27 00:42:40 <@!835296760649744384>  You'll be like us when you get a few expert ranks. Since you'll probably have a different view on builds. It might take a while though

Your point is? <@!835296760649744384>

plane-crazy 2021-07-28 01:37:06 FUCK?
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:40:24 well yes but no, a few torps and you're down
especially if it hits the folding motors
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:46:14 i mean sure that would work on torpedos that activate on impact, since they would explode upon contact. But its a different case for manually detonated torps
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:50:00 i have plane which i modified to fit in 9 manually detonated torpedoes. Each torpedo has around like 6 TNT. And yes it does quite a lot of damage.

Sometimes it literally splits ships in half if it explodes paralel to the ship
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:52:52 Indeed it would, since you would face a lot more aerial threats in plane crazy. Especially them pesky motorlock bombers. Yes i have a motorlock bomber which shits on massive ship user's FPS

help 2021-08-02 09:50:12 ah
help 2021-08-02 09:50:16 check the collisions
help 2021-08-02 09:50:25 something might be colliding with the moving part
help 2021-08-02 09:50:34 did you check cameras?
help 2021-08-02 09:50:47 hmm
help 2021-08-02 09:51:23 so if i were to press F ( the keybind that moves the motor) it would commit seizure?
help 2021-08-02 09:51:44 alright show me the motorlock mechanism
help 2021-08-02 09:52:03 alright
help 2021-08-02 09:53:48 wait wait

help 2021-08-02 09:58:33 jesus christ
help 2021-08-02 09:58:48 i only use 3 for my ovely motorlocked ship

help 2021-08-02 09:59:11 ah i could help with that
help 2021-08-02 09:59:24 i created a mechanism to help you time your builds
help 2021-08-02 09:59:52 though it might be frustrating to time more than 3 keybinds
help 2021-08-02 10:00:06 tbh, you don't really need more than 3 keybinds to fold
help 2021-08-02 10:01:11 would it still move if other motors are moving?
help 2021-08-02 10:01:21 can you group them into 1 keybind?
help 2021-08-02 10:01:24 if yes then do it
help 2021-08-02 10:01:27 it makes life way easier
help 2021-08-02 10:01:48 thats how i rotate parts

help 2021-08-02 10:03:10 just 1 side
help 2021-08-02 10:03:13 leave the rest

creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:12:01 desaturate the blue
make it grayish and pale
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:13:33 too much contrast
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:13:43 it looks sorta like a beginner's build first glance
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:15:36 hi
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:43:27 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:43:31 lit surely looks better
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:44:37 but maybe it would be way nicer if you were to slightly make the blue color (the one nearest to the fuselage) closer to gray to have that worn out effect
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:44:55 unless if you're trying to make it futuristic and bright

the-dump 2021-09-08 06:43:07 jojo summed up:
the-dump 2021-09-08 06:44:46 why are you spamming that?
the-dump 2021-09-08 06:54:01 I FORGOR
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:54:37 what would happen if we were to find out that aliens were somehow ancestrally related to us humans
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:55:18 correct
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:04 ion think wormholes could send you back in time
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:10 freeze time? probably
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:25 since you would probably move so fast that time slows down
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:58:07 we would be in deep trouble if they are fully blown space age civilization
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:58:51 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:03 perhaps the universe is infinite
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:10 no beginning no end
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:16 infinite
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:44 the observable universe is only around 12 b lys
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:51 yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:51 we dont know beyond that
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:00:06 perhaps there are more after that
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:00:22 well there must be more
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:01:16 i'd love to hop on a spaceship
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:01:25 liek the ones in sci fi movies
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:07 they must exist
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:23 we probably couldn't detect them yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:31 perhaps it has connection with dark matter or something
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:42 that would be almighty unlikely
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:47 but possible
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:03:31 send death row inmates for the ride of their lives
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:03:47 that would be the best way to go out imo
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:26 slower
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:32 not faster right?
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:47 the bigger the mass
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:50 the slower time flows
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:54 no
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:55 slower
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:01 oh yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:03 yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:12 wait
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:14 confused
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:29 thats why it's exciting
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:38 you never know what to expect
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:48 expect the unexpected
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:06:07 wait, if you were to expect the unexpected, wouldn't that make the unexpected expected?

the-dump 2021-09-08 08:06:50 Brainstorming moment
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:34 What if wood is one of the rarest material in the galaxy and has uses that we don't even know yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:43 think about it
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:49 wood comes from plants
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:57 plants = living beings
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:13 so it  would probably be rarer than diamonds in the galaxy
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:38 yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:40 wait.
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:51 you never know
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:58 there might be heat resistant plants

general 2021-09-30 10:40:04 Hear me out
general 2021-09-30 10:40:13 I've got a theory as to why crea became a weeb
general 2021-09-30 10:42:24 Crea started puberty, his voice started to crack and whatnot, His face is filled to the brim with pimples, which causes the girls to run away. The current sad and depressed Crea can not touch women as they would scream and run upon contact. Depressed crea went home and started anime, where he could find unlimited amounts of waifus and satisfy the need of "women"

plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:27:03 <@825584157009903636>
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:27:13 probably closest to what you're looking for
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:27:25 and its somewhat doable in plae crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:27:35 interceptor
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:27:36 so kinda

plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:29:02 man's looking for a fighter
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:29:04 not a battlecruiser
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:29:59 imma find some designs from ED
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:30:40 Elite dangerous eagle
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:31:31 Ship has multimple thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:31:41 main thrusters are located at the rear
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:31:45 i forgor how many
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:31:48 you can google it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:32:01 probably around that
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:32:21 Krait MK 2 Elite dangerous
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:32:39 (cockpit placement on this ship is kinda funny)
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:32:50 this one has certainly more than 4 thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:32:52 iirc
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:17 just google the 3d model
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:28 create something based on the model
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:36 and let your imagination go wild
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:40 yes.
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:47 but if you add wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:52 it becomes more subtle
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:33:58 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:34:03 but its incredibly inefficient
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:34:15 use hidden wing panels instead
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:34:22 those work better
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:34:35 you dont have space
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:34:37 right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:00 Thruster roll
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:01 or just
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:05 classing wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:13 whichever you link
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:15 like
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:47 would probably work
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:51 go test it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:35:57 never done something like that before
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 05:36:04 thrust vector for roll i mean

general 2022-05-24 11:26:31 that's what i would do

general 2022-05-24 11:26:53 i mean i would do that if i was given like 50 robux outta the blue to build him some shit

general 2022-05-24 11:53:53 Thats my line
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 13:59:39 looking cool
general 2022-05-26 14:00:37 there is always room for fixes
general 2022-05-26 14:01:01 there is always a way
general 2022-05-26 14:01:14 though that way might be absolute torture to execute
general 2022-05-26 14:01:20 yeah true
general 2022-05-26 14:01:43 fiddling with motorlocks that are already built in place and calculated
general 2022-05-26 14:01:44 is just
general 2022-05-26 14:01:47 hell
general 2022-05-26 14:02:01 as you can see
general 2022-05-26 14:02:02 lmao
general 2022-05-26 14:02:31 i find it an absolute PAIN to add or reduce motorlock
general 2022-05-26 14:02:40 so it looks good?
general 2022-05-26 14:03:46 quite a rare sight in pcc
general 2022-05-26 14:04:06 oh that would be a good benchmark
general 2022-05-26 14:04:32 are you not one?
general 2022-05-26 14:04:52 do you
general 2022-05-26 14:04:54 understand
general 2022-05-26 14:04:56 motorlock

general 2022-05-26 14:05:13 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2022-05-26 14:05:19 non motorlock user
general 2022-05-26 14:05:26 same <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2022-05-26 14:10:03 can't wait to see the seventh

general 2022-05-26 14:13:02 
general 2022-05-26 14:13:09 this is a pain in the ass to make
general 2022-05-26 14:13:14 goddamn
general 2022-05-26 14:13:37 doesn't change the fact that its absolute hell to achieve
general 2022-05-26 14:13:47 he probably has one
general 2022-05-26 14:14:04 have you seen hars's horten?
general 2022-05-26 14:15:05 eh wait
general 2022-05-26 14:15:08 hars doesn't have a horten
general 2022-05-26 14:15:56 dont forget to re hydrate
general 2022-05-26 14:16:00 LMAO
general 2022-05-26 14:16:07 you still haven't seen his work
general 2022-05-26 14:16:14 he's a beast
general 2022-05-26 14:16:23 that is not an exaggeration.
general 2022-05-26 14:16:37 as you can see
general 2022-05-26 14:16:39 he is a beast
general 2022-05-26 14:17:01 dude's honed his skills to the maximum
general 2022-05-26 14:22:52 Best of luck
general 2022-05-26 14:25:15 idk about you but i find you choosing his job slightly offensive
general 2022-05-26 14:25:20 its just me
general 2022-05-26 14:25:24 dont take it personally
general 2022-05-26 14:27:06 please tell me you're being sarcastic
general 2022-05-26 14:28:03 oh no
general 2022-05-26 14:28:06 nevermind
general 2022-05-26 14:28:46 there are a few people in pcc who do this to subtly roast people who do this on purpose with serious intention
general 2022-05-26 14:31:42 nuclear power would probably be really safe when in the hands of next generation engineers
general 2022-05-26 14:32:04 i mean it's already safe as it is now
general 2022-05-26 14:32:17 yes
general 2022-05-26 14:32:28 fission is literally
general 2022-05-26 14:32:32 no?
general 2022-05-26 14:32:32 atomic bomb
general 2022-05-26 14:32:53 it goes kaboom
general 2022-05-26 14:33:07 too much and it evaporates everything in a 5 mile radius
general 2022-05-26 14:33:28 fission is quite scary tbh
general 2022-05-26 14:33:43 its a controlled atomic bomb
general 2022-05-26 14:34:01 fr?
general 2022-05-26 14:34:22 i think the main problem with fusion is that it takes a lot of energy to jump start
general 2022-05-26 14:34:24 iirc
general 2022-05-26 14:34:50 are you an engineer?
general 2022-05-26 14:34:59 cause you talk like one
general 2022-05-26 14:35:33 interesting way of learning
general 2022-05-26 14:35:42 ohh kyle hill
general 2022-05-26 14:35:47 yeah i like him
general 2022-05-26 14:36:07 it takes a massive amount of energy to start right?
general 2022-05-26 14:36:38 no
general 2022-05-26 14:36:40 fuck you
general 2022-05-26 14:36:44 ungreen energy

general 2022-05-26 14:37:54 what are those?
general 2022-05-26 14:38:41 yo what
general 2022-05-26 14:38:46 those exist
general 2022-05-26 14:39:04 excited for the future of energy
general 2022-05-26 14:39:15 man knows his things
general 2022-05-26 14:39:16 goddamn

general 2022-06-04 23:23:04 besiege is insanely hard
general 2022-06-04 23:23:16 yeah.
general 2022-06-04 23:23:31 doesn't matter
general 2022-06-04 23:23:43 all of that goes to the drain when in face with besiege
general 2022-06-04 23:23:49 trust me
general 2022-06-04 23:24:19 closest to plane crazy is
general 2022-06-04 23:24:21 stormworks
general 2022-06-04 23:24:22 imo
general 2022-06-04 23:24:38 ???
general 2022-06-04 23:24:48 yeah whatever yous ay
general 2022-06-04 23:25:07 what?
general 2022-06-04 23:25:36 cause of the innerworkings required for the build right/
general 2022-06-04 23:25:37 ?
general 2022-06-04 23:25:48 oh and dont forget
general 2022-06-04 23:25:56 besiege lags a LOT.
general 2022-06-04 23:26:04 worse than plane crazy
general 2022-06-04 23:26:17 yeah
general 2022-06-04 23:26:18 sadly
general 2022-06-04 23:26:48 you spawn a mid size fighter in besiege

general 2022-06-04 23:27:27 state your specs
general 2022-06-04 23:27:53 GPU CPU
general 2022-06-04 23:27:54 not ram

general 2022-06-04 23:31:21 <@464259154916147211> have you tried space engineers?
general 2022-06-04 23:31:40 yes.
general 2022-06-04 23:31:45 a lot of space
general 2022-06-04 23:32:05 planets
general 2022-06-04 23:32:16 yes
general 2022-06-04 23:32:20 it is literally that
general 2022-06-04 23:32:31 there are servers
general 2022-06-04 23:32:35 building system is good
general 2022-06-04 23:32:42 physics is good
general 2022-06-04 23:32:50 less buggy than plane crazy
general 2022-06-04 23:33:10 yeah
general 2022-06-04 23:33:12 there are plenty
general 2022-06-04 23:33:23 i mean you join servers

general 2022-06-04 23:36:22 basically like minecraft with plane crazy
general 2022-06-04 23:36:40 i like space engineers
general 2022-06-04 23:36:44 cause it isn't DLC based
general 2022-06-04 23:36:56 everything is in the base game
general 2022-06-04 23:37:04 DLCs are just decorative blocks
general 2022-06-04 23:37:05 mostly

general 2022-06-04 23:37:39 btw
general 2022-06-04 23:37:45 learning curve is quite intense
general 2022-06-04 23:37:52 but not as intense as beseiege
general 2022-06-04 23:37:55 besiege
general 2022-06-04 23:38:25 hk
general 2022-06-04 23:38:26 hm
general 2022-06-04 23:38:31 6/10
general 2022-06-04 23:38:40 space engineers is like
general 2022-06-04 23:38:42 7/10
general 2022-06-04 23:38:50 11/10
general 2022-06-04 23:38:55 its
general 2022-06-04 23:38:57 hard
general 2022-06-04 23:38:59 tbh
general 2022-06-04 23:39:20 space engineers is like plane crazy + stormworks to a simpler degree
general 2022-06-04 23:39:30 1/10th of stormworks
general 2022-06-04 23:39:47 my all time favourite space engineers
general 2022-06-04 23:39:58 though i don't play multiplayer too much
general 2022-06-04 23:40:05 so take that into consideration
general 2022-06-04 23:40:13 most multiplayer servers are survival
general 2022-06-04 23:40:15 i play creative
general 2022-06-04 23:40:26 i get beat up
general 2022-06-04 23:40:38 cause my ships aren't as good as theirs in terms of firepower
general 2022-06-04 23:40:45 but
general 2022-06-04 23:40:54 my ships are better in terms of looks
general 2022-06-04 23:40:55 so yes
general 2022-06-04 23:41:15 expect that
general 2022-06-04 23:41:16 yes
general 2022-06-04 23:41:22 there was this
general 2022-06-04 23:41:33 pyramid thing spammed with guns on a space engineers toury
general 2022-06-04 23:41:36 tourny
general 2022-06-04 23:42:02 gets boring if you can't stand single player for 4 days straight
general 2022-06-04 23:42:36 i spend most of my time in single player building spaceships inspired by pinterest or instagram
general 2022-06-04 23:43:03 idk
general 2022-06-04 23:43:07 go watch some youtube
general 2022-06-04 23:43:13 about space engineers
general 2022-06-04 23:43:19 and decide for yourself if it's fun or not

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:46:55 it is okay
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:04 like i said
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:07 until you realize
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:12 before that

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:54 is
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:59 bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:48:12 its mentally demanding

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:49:50 you got a point
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:50:10 gets repetitive after some time lmao
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:20 then the entirety of the game wouldn't exist
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:30 since anime - styled people don't exist
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:54 Honestly i dont understand people hating on genshin
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:03 its just from my perspective
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:12 let them play the game
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:25 what exactly?
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:32 that one i can't argue
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:57 what in tarnation

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:17 fans are down bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:43 still watch my fair share of anime sometimes
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:46 what bothers me is
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:49 the voice acting
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:56 my god is it bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:19 some of them are really good don't get me wrong
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:40 but the regular not-so-popular animes have shit voice acting
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:50 that would be interesting ngl
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:17 really depends
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:21 on what the artists make
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:31 degenerate content
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:37 or just something that looks cool
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:05 I also do not understand why people like furries
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:07 they scare me
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:35 okay this might be a good excuse as to why people love them but
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:37 hear me out

plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:24:24 is called insane motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:24:38 2000 motors used and the build isn't even close to finished
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:05 i forgot the motor amount
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:08 🗿
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:15 has been a year since i last touched the game
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:25 why use motor2
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:30 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:32 i use that too
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:25:34 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:04 wing sweep, fuselage, color scheme
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:06 goodness
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:13 no no no
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:16 cam locking isn't required
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:34 i despise cam locking
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:26:40 i do everything motors
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:27:00 for now
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:27:00 i think it looks okay
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:27:26 then you've already hated 90% of the game
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:28:22 its too small to look good
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:28:33 for your skill level
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:28:46 yeah i know
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:28:51 but if you wanna make something look good
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:28:54 then start bigger
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:29:07 dude shut up with the "i hear a pp joke"
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:29:24 then you're off to a harder start
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:29:26 goodluck
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:30:26 exactly what i was thinking
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:30:53 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:30:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:31:14 a sacrifice should be made in order for a build to look good
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:31:20 personally i dont really do PVP that much
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:31:48 but there are a few pvp thingamajigs that kinda look better than average
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:05 pvp build = less motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:10 usually ends up looking mediocre
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:16 unless you're a god like nam
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:19 or ikfin
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:49 if you want your builds to look aesthetic then
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:32:56 consider taking inspiration from
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:33:35 all of my jets are functional
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:33:42 so are my ships
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:33:57 who the fuck builds a plane just to be on the ground
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:34:00 psycho
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 13:34:19 yeah you just might end up better than now after 5 months
