creations-chat 2023-04-02 02:39:25 Push the part in front out of the way, there is clearance between the pieces
creations-chat 2023-04-02 15:55:24 Capturing uses a ejector to remove the piece. The "anchor arms" are offset, so there will be two rows. They use text to noclip, so a piece can move over a ejected part's anchor arm.
