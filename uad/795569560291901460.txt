plane-crazy 2021-12-25 15:23:59 If my helicopter functions, but it's only 19 blocks, should i be proud or disappointed of myself?
general 2021-12-25 15:25:41 I knew it's a joke <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
general 2021-12-25 15:26:07 Tomorrow christmas over <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-12-25 15:28:03 My mental problem causes me to be fine with that<:PewPew:532303441293344778>
