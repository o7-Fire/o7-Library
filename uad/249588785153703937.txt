The Tale of ozmitoskol (249588785153703937)
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:30:34 I made a submarine the length of the build zone and armed it with 8 guided missiles. For some reason, when I launched missiles out of the submarine (fully submerged or partially submerged), they moved slower and turned slower. If I spawned the submarine out of water like at the airport or base and fired the missiles, they worked close to normally (almost as fast, maneuverable and controllable as the guided missilesâ€™ are supposed to be). I think this is either something to do with the weight of the submarine affecting the missilesâ€™ speed and maneuverability (less likely) or the air/water resistance affecting the submarine is transferring over to the missilesâ€™ (more likely).

I think this would be classed as a bug but Iâ€™m really not sure...

(This may help: I tried doubling the amount of thrusters and swapping out the thrusters for more powerful ones on my missile and launched them from the water with my submarine but there was barely a noticeable difference in speed or maneuverability.)
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:36:45 <@456226577798135808>  Is that an insult or congrats? If itâ€™s like an American term or something then I donâ€™t get it...
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:36:56 Ye
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:37:21 The missile in out of the water but the sub is in the water
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:37:41 And Iâ€™m piloting the missile
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:38:46 Water physics should just be affecting the sub and not the missile when is is in the air out of the water.
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:42:05 > fly a plane into the water
<@!609198621526589450>  When the plane come out of the water it should fly without water physics affecting it. But when my missile comes out of the water, the water physics seem to still affect the missile because my submarine is still underwater. It seems like the water physics affecting the sub is affecting my missile even when the missile is out of the water
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:43:17 Ok
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:43:58 <@!609198621526589450> I tried with the seat underwater and out of the water, same results
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:44:41 As long as the sub is affected by water, the missile is also affected even if not in the water
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:45:05 The missile does detach from the sub if thatâ€™s important
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:49:27 Should I send a vid? (Using my original design)
bug-reports 2020-05-11 22:50:37 Canâ€™t do it now tho, almost midnight and currently no access to the computer, Iâ€™ll have to send it in around 7-8 hours time, soz

general 2020-05-12 16:26:18 What does the physics setting on anchored blocks do?
general 2020-05-12 16:26:51 I donâ€™t really see a difference
general 2020-05-12 16:27:03 Ok thx
general 2020-05-12 16:27:30 Kk thx

plane-crazy 2020-06-26 19:55:54 Letâ€™s put a tank in a sub
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 19:56:16 Like trash builds on a server
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 19:56:32 Jk, all build are good

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 20:06:40 Wait, materials have different properties?
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 20:22:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 20:23:12 Since your build platform is empty, I assume you copied his dark void and used it against him
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 10:16:09 Whatâ€™s the lightest material?
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 18:14:13 Donâ€™t to be safe
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 18:20:53 Just change the server link
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 18:21:24 It you can only have 1 per person

general 2020-09-02 17:44:04 OMG, save data 4m, I hope there are more slots too or maybe a bigger build area...
