creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:04:28 To get a good score in <#384025409945337856> you must design something that meets one of the following:
Achieves a record (Speed, Least of X, Most Y carried without hindering Z)
Looks really cool (Many ways to achieve this)
Looks very accurate to something
Has an absurd amount of motor lock (The use of motors with lock enabled to place blocks in places they usually are not allowed in)
Good photography (Don't just put 5% of the creation in frame)
Meme (May result in warn)
Misc (The people of PCC are weird and may randomly upvote something)

general 2021-08-26 21:53:16 im not saying i believe the shit
general 2021-08-26 21:53:37 im saying you took it as earth had literal rings like saturn

general 2021-08-26 22:00:07 so your saying that
general 2021-08-26 22:00:15 the center of gravity is in the middle then
general 2021-08-26 22:00:58 so wouldnt all the mass be sucked into the center then
general 2021-08-26 22:01:21 yeah
general 2021-08-26 22:01:23 it spin fast
general 2021-08-26 22:01:54 it would have to spin a hell of a lot quicker for that shit to normalize

general 2021-08-27 16:42:11 rickje said that PC2 map will be about 20x the size of the current one in land mass so i measured that out and put our current base plot and also the airport and traintracks as a reference of scale
general 2021-08-27 16:42:36 its not that bad
general 2021-08-27 16:42:44 the water will be infinite
general 2021-08-27 16:43:02 noo noo in land mass it will be 20x the size but the water will be infinite
general 2021-08-27 16:43:09 im assuming the same way dynamic ship simulator does it
general 2021-08-27 16:43:15 with just a massive plane of water
general 2021-08-27 16:44:00 im going off of this which he said back in july

general 2021-08-27 16:45:05 20 player servers though
general 2021-08-27 16:45:35 current map is suck
general 2021-08-27 16:45:42 i hope the new map has a circuit and also a rally track
general 2021-08-27 16:46:33 heres a picture with the entire land mass of plane crazy
general 2021-08-27 16:46:38 besides the rocky area

general 2021-08-27 16:49:55 i love how everyone that the map was gonna be procedurally generated like minecraft
general 2021-08-27 16:49:58 when he said infinite
general 2021-08-27 16:49:59 he meant the water
general 2021-08-27 16:50:02 not the land mass
general 2021-08-27 16:50:10 jesus christ imagine minecraft terrain generation
general 2021-08-27 16:50:12 thatd be terrible

general 2021-08-27 16:50:32 java
general 2021-08-27 16:50:40 but uh no procedurally generated would suck
general 2021-08-27 16:50:46 cause it would be extremely bland
general 2021-08-27 16:50:48 no cool land marks
general 2021-08-27 16:50:56 and it would probably break
general 2021-08-27 16:51:20 not true

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:45:03 😎
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:48:24 my plane still better ten urs
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:54:42 hows it not better 🤣
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:56:16 least i got motor control surface
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:57:32 that makes no sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:58:44 more drag means more lift <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:59:53 with lift comes drag
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:00:14 theres a whole formula for it
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:00:23 it does in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:01:33 nobody is going to place shit horizontally
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:02:17 it adds stability
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:02:22 im talking about motor control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:02:47 i meant vertically
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:02:50 he made the same mistake
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:03:05 and i guess it would be horizontal to the axis of the wing <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:03:30 motor control surfaces are more efficient than regular control surface
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:14 your going out of the way to disprove a point i didnt make
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:32 nobody puts a rudder infront of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:37 nobody
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:48 your making terrible analogy's
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:05:52 is either of our plane a flying wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:34 i dont even know what your trying to disprove anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:35 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:50 my plane will still be better
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:52 😬

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:20 never said they didnt
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:33 unde built a better plane more then
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:59 they are
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:06 they provide more lift then control surfaces for the space they take up
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:13 they are more efficient at the task at hand
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:15 i won
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:17 your bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:57 never said you were bad

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:16:26 or is that just reflection
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:16:29 because roblox glass is ass
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:16:59 mig-23 have terrible reliability
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:18 probably the least successful production scale fighter aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:20 but they still cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:29 yeah but the mig-25 was way better for that job
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:45 f-14
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:49 aim-54 phoenix
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:51 100 mile range
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:17:58 before mig-23 shitty radar even see the f-14
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:18:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:18:28 deff
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:18:33 mig-29 crazy success
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:19:18 shitty soviet parts combined with complex variable sweep wing rotation
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:19:24 and other bs
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:19:39 mig-23 was a weird plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:20:24 in full sweep the mig-23 was incredibly unstable and liked to nose dive, and in sweep completely forward it was also extremely unstable and liked to flat spin
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:20:26 shitty plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:20:27 but its cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:21:03 flat spin isnt controlled tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:21:04 at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:21:24 imagine having a actual PC that can run shit, have actual games and still play roblox

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:11 at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:11 they arent the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:19 f-15 in a dogfight would eat a mig-25
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:39 mig-25 is a interceptor and a f-15 is a air superiority fighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:46 doubt that too
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:47 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:49 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:23:51 not balanced
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:24:22 F15 has better aesa radar, long range weaponry and other bs
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:24:41 su-57 sucks in comparison to the f-22
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:24:50 cause theres only 13 of them 🤣
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:24:59 13 su-57s vs F-22

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:25:25 india pulling out of the program and russia cant afford to build more
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:26:02 CHINESE F-35

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:27:27 aka the thing russia made because they cant afford the su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:27:38 also its good for export
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:27:51 fighter jets are massive man

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:15:20 i wanted to do a stealth livery
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:15:21 but like
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:15:23 it was boring af
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:15:31 so i based this one off a CAG f-18 livery
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:15:49 which wouldnt be as stealthy as the stealth paint bs they put on f-22s and crap..
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:16:09 to make f/a-18
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:16:13 step 1, make SU-35
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:16:15 step 2, fail
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:17:42 su-35 came to my head because of the intakes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 04:17:45 literally the only reason
