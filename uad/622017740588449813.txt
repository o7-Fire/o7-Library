general 2020-04-22 13:35:56 tnaks
general 2020-04-22 13:36:21 They should add tank tracks
general 2020-04-22 13:36:26 And torpedos
general 2020-04-22 13:36:36 ~~And a good map~~
general 2020-04-22 13:37:06 Kinda
general 2020-04-22 13:37:17 Torpedos you can but you need to give them a bunch of room
general 2020-04-22 13:37:35 Because regular rockets just explode under water
general 2020-04-22 13:38:00 I'm yet to make a good VTOL
general 2020-04-22 13:38:03 I dont get how it's done
general 2020-04-22 13:38:11 I've made pretty much everything except vtols
general 2020-04-22 13:38:26 They kinda just tip over because you can't really make mictrocontrollers
general 2020-04-22 13:38:42 Jet VTOL's, 4 prop VTOL's
general 2020-04-22 13:39:00 I know how to make Jet VTOLs but im not very good at it
general 2020-04-22 13:39:13 That's what I mean, vertical rotor vtols
general 2020-04-22 13:39:31 I believe you have to balance it really well
general 2020-04-22 13:39:33 Or it tips
general 2020-04-22 13:40:03 Wdym
general 2020-04-22 13:40:46 What do you mean by that? Like the Center of Mass should be aligned with the thrusters?
general 2020-04-22 13:41:25 I see
general 2020-04-22 13:41:52 Is the blue marker for Aero Dynamics or thrust?
general 2020-04-22 13:42:14 Which I assume is thrust
general 2020-04-22 13:42:18 Like engines
general 2020-04-22 13:42:33 Is lift where most the wings are?
general 2020-04-22 13:43:07 I assume that signifies where on the aircraft most lift is produced
general 2020-04-22 13:44:44 I might have another go with VTOL's, but so far I seem to have very little control over it
general 2020-04-22 13:45:11 I can't figure out how to have control over yaw, roll and pitch all without having like 20 thrusters
general 2020-04-22 13:46:04 Stuff like that IRL requires precise microcontrollers that obviously you cant get in-game
general 2020-04-22 13:46:27 nice
general 2020-04-22 13:46:37 10am? I had to get up at 9
general 2020-04-22 13:46:45 to sign in
general 2020-04-22 13:46:51 And then go straight back to bed
