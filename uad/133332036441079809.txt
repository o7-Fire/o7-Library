plane-crazy 2020-04-05 01:50:52 <@!217336009455566848>  Hello. I do not want to waste your time or anything, and this is a great game. May your team add a function to check if for deleting a save "undo". As in, when you load a build, it asks if you are sure. I misclicked and my single rotor heli was deleted. 6 hours lost :/. Thanks. I will make a new one, its a joy to build in this simulator. Thanks.
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 02:00:47 Wow, I didnt know

help 2020-04-09 23:57:00 Interesting. So all blocks are the same density except the weird ones like ballast and helium <@!419477639229865984> ?
help 2020-04-09 23:57:58 Well then thats volume... not mass
help 2020-04-10 00:02:52 What is the mass of the helium block then, to calculate density? or is all mass relative?

creations-chat 2020-04-10 19:36:23 &suggest programmable sensor blocks that have spherical relative inputs. People can use taylor polynomials to approximate the conversion, but allows for radar, sensor avoidance, and links to motor2. This can allow for fire&forget missiles, easier avionics, electronic swashplates, adaptive supension, and neat stuff. Maybe like space engineers but only to motor2. Thank you. This game is epic

general 2020-05-10 04:48:23 weird math question
general 2020-05-10 04:48:34 Say I have a vector field
general 2020-05-10 04:48:53 And I have another vector field of differing magnitudes.
general 2020-05-10 04:49:02 Is there a way to compare them to see if they shifted?
general 2020-05-10 04:49:25 Is there a defined process
general 2020-05-10 04:49:40 that scales the magnitudes of the second field to the first one,
general 2020-05-10 04:49:45 and then subtracts the second one
general 2020-05-10 04:50:12 to resolve whether the second field is actually the first field shifted?
general 2020-05-10 04:54:48 in other words
general 2020-05-10 04:55:01 is there a mathematical process to tell if a vector field has shifted ?

creations-chat 2020-06-03 15:25:45 How the heck do wings actually generate lift in this game
creations-chat 2020-06-03 15:25:51 Is it only by angle of attack?
creations-chat 2020-06-03 15:26:13 If so, I think there should be an airfoil block 1 x 2
creations-chat 2020-06-03 15:27:00 Or airfoil option for each wing block

creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:41 define
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:48 does that mean there were vibrations?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:04 or angular momentumn conservation thing?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:29 wdym rough?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:41 I am just curious. I have not seen blades with "dampening" before
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:14:17 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:15 Usually when I have blades hit the limit, I try to increase rotation rate or make the blades more massive for a larger correcting force. I will try out some suspension though.
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:24 thanks for the idea
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:54 Still,
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:09 wouldnt just increasing the motor 2 hinge angles reduce the vibration problem
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:15 sure it would have more flapping angle
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:26 but it could save some space
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:17:50 Technically with that design, I dont think you need a lag hinge
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:18:28 because the heavy blades can just wiggle about the suspension,

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 22:24:54 <@!437152336176087052> is the hub tilting on it to be considered semi rigid? wack.
help 2020-09-11 22:27:15 <@!586086848833519617>        maybe your heli does that cause there is a weird motor angle thing going on. Using vertical double motors on the lower swashplate made my heli have weird vibration issues and wildly flung the rotor in the AD, but it only had 1 double motor thing on the lower swash. Maybe you can just put rope? Probably smaller .
creations-chat 2020-09-26 01:19:23 <@!437152336176087052> thanks for the kind words. All swashplates are neat in their ways, and I guess I found my nich for 1 blocker ones. So has sak with their motor magic ones.

help 2021-04-01 04:09:41 Oh yeah
help 2021-04-01 04:09:49 So you gotta tilt your rotor blades forward
help 2021-04-01 04:10:02 Draw a line from center of gravity to tail rotor
help 2021-04-01 04:10:14 The main rotor has to be parallel to it

help 2021-04-01 04:10:49 
help 2021-04-01 04:11:01 You have to make it

help 2021-04-01 04:11:22 To the line drawn between the tail rotor and center of gravity (2points)
help 2021-04-01 04:11:49 Is to tilt the rotor blades with camweld or locked motor 2
help 2021-04-01 04:11:50 Or
help 2021-04-01 04:11:54 Bring tail lower
help 2021-04-01 04:11:56 Or
help 2021-04-01 04:12:11 Raise center of gravity but that is in feasible for Huey
help 2021-04-01 04:12:26 Wait a sec
help 2021-04-01 04:12:29 Wait a sec
help 2021-04-01 04:12:41 Is the main rotor powered?
help 2021-04-01 04:12:59 Motor or super rocket?
help 2021-04-01 04:15:49 Is tail rotor always on?

bot-central 2021-08-14 18:29:06 !servers
creations-chat 2021-08-16 19:36:56 Extremely accurate details and approximation on form, so great job. However, with roblox crude blocks, the effect is kind of clunky . It is definitely awesome and I prefer clunky, but others prefer less accurate just smooth stuff that is less perfect. Still, great job. Making an entire heli in this style is a way different take and I really like how it’s going so far so good luck. I’m actually making a MI26 halo right now too for the past months but a smaller scale with an 8 blade swashplate. Godspeed. Totally didn’t think this type of cockpit was possible
bot-central 2021-08-16 22:35:07 !servers
creations-chat 2021-08-17 16:57:20 Ayo you can do this with TNT balls. Literally the exact same thing but with 2 breech blocks. Very neatly made though. Made a BMP3 and armata loader using T-90 type loading. However, the bmp didn’t use an elevator. I guess the bmp3 is more t-80 styled though I really like how yours is so accurate though and the carousel labels are genius.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:20:43 I need one of those
help 2021-08-19 00:24:25 Ayo not a help but a thank you. In the past year, the game seems to be working a lot better with motor interactions and ropes. My swashplates from 5 months ago don’t work anymore, but the new ones are so lag free even faster. Extremely bussin game

I have no idea why the hell people are so insistent that a character is not functionally 2 meters tall, thereby equating 1 block to 1 meter. Cringe bro. This insistence, hot damn.

creations-chat 2021-09-15 03:57:07 ok motorlock custom trails cylinder. Just not what it is right now. Maybe half wedges in a square. Not that though
creations-chat 2021-09-15 05:00:32 just my opinion. A great tank, but if there was 1 glaring detail I would change it wouldnt be the tracks, the paint, the contours, but the barrel

bug-reports 2022-03-05 19:03:13 I feel like something has changed as on multiple PC's, rope builds work differently now
bug-reports 2022-03-05 19:03:59 When they are spun, its as if they have more centrifugal force. This may because they are heavier, or because they have drag
