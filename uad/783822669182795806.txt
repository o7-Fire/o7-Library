plane-crazy 2021-07-09 14:56:22 if they get shot or exploded in the perfect spot they completely crumple
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 14:57:04 like one i shot once or twice and it looked like their plane split into another plane like a single cell organism

plane-crazy 2022-10-31 15:15:47 ok so
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 15:15:50 tf do i build lmao
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:44:07 is it confirmed or not if pc2 will have a larger plot?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:48:22 sweet
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:48:39 what im building its near impossible and folds weaken builds
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:48:46 which is what i dont want
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:53:26 a fatass futuristic tank
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 19:55:27 so far its just the front treads
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 20:48:14 "tnt armor"
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 20:48:30 i dont know how to feel about that
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 21:58:09 more shit and things
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:08:16 yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:09:14 my expectations for pc2 arent too high
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:10:01 im expecting a far larger map, better models for engines and other blocks of the sort, larger plot, better physics and more mechanical bits like pulleys
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:10:16 not really too much in the longrun
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:11:33 depends
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:12:33 idk why would you need conveyors
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:12:41 or ball wheels
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:12:49 or magnets
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 00:08:47 mostly finished i think
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 00:09:00 still need to add sounds and improve the barrel
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 00:10:05 also need to add outriggers purely for extra detail
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 00:33:16 goofy key
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 01:26:35 aside from a better map my main expectation for pc2 is a laser pvp weapon
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:19:15 tonk do a stretch
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:20:32 i would keep the ability for it to do this if the motors on the front treads didnt freak out
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:20:41 since it uses motor 2s for turning
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:20:58 they just freak the hell out when theres second motors on the y axis
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:22:31 but i kinda do prefer this
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:26:40 thats the problem
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:31:45 so since the tank uses motor 2s to turn its front treads for
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:31:47 turning
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 01:31:59 its kind of impossible to make it walk without it glitching out
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 15:50:16 they're too long
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 18:49:47 *SNIFFFFF*
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 23:31:03 opinions on this custom jet design?
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 23:31:36 epic
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 03:22:24 average parachute experience
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 03:57:27 i fucking hate the laws of physics
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 13:20:03 add some stuff like supports and pipes along the walls
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:30:48 bro said "fuck it" and made the entire plane an air brake
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 18:07:08 some mf blacklisted me after i flung his build after he flung me lmfao

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:43:11 i went to the null zone with just the jetpack
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:46:04 basically a point where robox cant recognize where your avatar is anymore
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:46:17 its at least 1 million studs away from the game's center point
