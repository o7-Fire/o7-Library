help 2022-12-11 10:01:00 You need a plane with strong Yaw. Pull up then YAW and when your nearly finished with the 360* hold the same direction but as roll (if you are spinning rightwards, hold D, leftwards hold A) then stabilize yourself and pray you did it fast enough.

creations-chat 2023-01-08 12:57:25 just ask them whats wrong and try fix it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 13:00:45 in my opinion the wheels could use some texture, and perhaps you could work on the design of the weapons, perhaps adding some depth into the armour design. you could also add Missile Railing on the side of the thing to guard the wheels from any damage
