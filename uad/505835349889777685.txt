plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:37:27 Crazy Planes oil rig 1 is now active
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 23:37:40 fuel prices dropped 10 dollars a gallon
bug-reports 2018-12-09 05:19:10 Whenever i sit in a pilot chair all sound previously made by my contraption stops.
bug-reports 2018-12-09 05:19:30 and in order t get that sound back i need to hit the "control" button
bug-reports 2018-12-09 05:19:52 and with jets hitting any control button shuts them completely off even at full power.

creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:24:39 fuel prices have dropped 10 dollars per gallon in the Crazy Plane world cause i built this baby
creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:25:25 and then people decide to destroy it dumping millions of gallons of crude oil into the ocean
creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:26:38 
creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:26:55 the build limit needs to be higher so i can complete the drill tower
creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:27:45 there is little room to do so, but good idea
creations-chat 2018-12-09 05:27:49 im going to try

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 05:45:44 Drill tower stage two completed
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 05:45:56 going to drill pipe extension
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 05:57:57 i finished the drill tower, but my only issue is that the motor for the spinning drill pipe is at the top of the folding tower meanign the second bottom portion of the drill pipe cant move
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 06:06:29 
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 06:06:45 Drill tower and drill pipe extension completed

creations-chat 2018-12-09 22:45:02 No offense, but no body would ever bother to create that cause its a "not good" idea
creations-chat 2018-12-09 22:45:27 the rotors hit each other and the shaking cause the heli to be unstable

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:01:09 How come two magnets wont attach?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:02:46 Those two black boxes which are magnets are supposed to touch and when i press "2" they're supposed to attach and "weld" together, but they dont.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:02:52 why?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:05:12 you probably have European blood in you
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:06:01 have you ever had a heritage test? <@!184819059404046336>
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:07:12 at this point in life everybody should have just about everything
bug-reports 2018-12-09 23:15:21 magnets wont stick to each other

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:41:29 unless the ude is hacking
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:41:33 *dude
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:46:30 how come i cnat place the large thrusters and jets in the middle of the block
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:46:41 make my builds look more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:47:57 let me PLACE THE LARGE THRUSTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANG HUGE THRUSTERS.... REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:48:08 whats with all the mutes?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:48:21 long?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:49:28 the huge thrusters is 3x5x3 the large thruster which im trying to place on the side the huge thrusters is a 2x4x2
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:49:56 i know but its driving up the wall and across the ceiling
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:50:09 (its driving me insane)
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:51:16 i could probably use pistons but that would cause mass chaos in the perfectionist department
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:53:13 im in a broken PvP server
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:53:27 the chat barely works and i cant despawn my truck thingy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:53:53 actually none of the buttons are really working
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:54:28 i fell like the server itself is melting
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:54:35 it shouldnt be this laggy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:54:52 especially since a bunch of tiny boi planes are flying around
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:54:56 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:55:17 lag cleared
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:57:56 what would happen when you turn that on?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 18:04:14 some dude blew himslef up trying to missle bomb me
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 18:04:36 the harmless truck stuck in the water unable to move
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:43:24 the ggam shut odwn and gave me no time to save my creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:43:49 somebody who works on the game, give time to save your builds before shutting down servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:44:20 there was none
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:44:37 and now the server is shutting down twice and now it has a countdown
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:44:45 🙄
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:45:11 i see that after the server restarted for the second time
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:45:19 read dude
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:45:51 i just got kicked
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:45:59 A+
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:46:28 so you restart the servers twice and then kick us?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:46:31 lovely
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:47:00 i got kicked twice now
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:47:22 somebody should fix the server updates
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:48:47 somebody apparently got kicked times in our server
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:48:55 *5
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:49:05 jeez my brain is fried after school
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:20:50 omg the suspension is to bouncy
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:23:13 can i post two things in suggestions. That make it less triggering for some people.
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:24:41 it says ask to post in suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:24:47 so i assumed that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:33:23 notice that i ask for one simple thing and its completely ignored... story of my life
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:34:25 there are copies of every popular game yet they either get deleted or ignored by everyone
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:34:43 let me test magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:36:36 im still testing the magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:36:41 so far they dont work
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:37:02 they attract i can confrim that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:38:05 magnets do not wled still
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:38:09 *weld
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:39:35 hmm... i put the strenght hi enough and it started slowly spinning the lose object like its supposed to, but no weld
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:40:21 also the lose part is having a massive siezure
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:41:19 roblox probably broke this game along with others
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:41:32 jailbreak is one good example
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:41:37 its broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:42:03 roblox needs to stop updating so much, or take into account the other games
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:46:51 ITS A PEEPER
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:48:01 do yo actually play subnautica <@!121007634714329089>  or do you just like the icon?

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:57:14 but then people remembered jailbreak and meepcity exist and went back to that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:57:42 somebody just take the top 5 games down so other can have a chance
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:57:57 wonder why we dont see that many new games
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:59:08 its make no difference after 30 FPS cause your brain cant process any smoother than that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:59:58 plus there is that framerate sync with the screen to reduce video glitches
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:00:27 how does one tell that high
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:00:43 do you have super human vision?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:01:49 imma go to PvP and try and drive my chubby mobile form the airport back to spawn without getting destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:03:11 from what i heard your device only takes 33% of the processing needed to run roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:03:20 the rest is done in the servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:05:22 somebody put osme dang crossroads on the train tracks so vehicles can easily get across
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:05:57 anybody that can work on the game

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:11:57 thats not an actual thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:20:50 somebody made a flying turret and is fighting wiht it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:21:23 theere are a lot of LEGIT builds in my PvP server

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:24:59 i need it for my plane to aim easier

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:46:59 what requirements?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:48:23 imma try and make a fast vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:48:42 planes in the game are finicky
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:48:54 but i made a stable trike ultralight
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:49:17 i made this small of a plane stable
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:50:15 so i ahve a vehicle that can go faster than 500 SPS
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:50:41 got the trailblazer rank (not actually but technically)
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:50:49 now imma go faster
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:54:07 we need a long flat area of the map for testing the speed of creations and ahving drag races
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:57:49 actually imma work on my oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 23:57:58 try and get different ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 00:00:19 my biggest build has 1499 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:26:29 whaats with all these creations?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:26:36 and what are they?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:27:34 somebody should make a clock using pistons and motors and other things
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:31:54 i just realized that one of the ranks is bombardier
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:32:09 isnt that a company that makes planes and trains?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:38:28 so i managed to get my car under the ice...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:38:46 that was not supposed to happen
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:41:03 Part of plan would mean burning down a server :?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:41:06 :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:41:51 i dont want to wake up cause then i have to go to school
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:44:54 you got a hole in your right wing
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:45:08 XpertNub
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:46:37 <:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:49:54 so in my server somebody made a box that fills the entire build area, a vtol plane with 500 to many wings, an a shark car that is chasing people around trying to eat them
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:50:22 and im in my corner making a better version of an oil rig compared to my first
the-dump 2019-01-17 04:53:15 thats funneh
the-dump 2019-01-17 04:53:32 but youtube doesnt care about the middle and low class youtubers
the-dump 2019-01-17 04:53:54 aka copyright claims and the elsa gate crisis
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:56:01 yeah dat goof
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:56:06 *good
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:58:34 somebody made a steampunk style cannon on rails
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 04:58:47 why are there so many cool builds on my server
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:01:03 and then you do it but you do donald trump voice over
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:01:11 trolled
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:03:33 so there is gustav the railway gun and tim toom truck
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:03:38 in one server
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:06:04 this is my server
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:14:17 gah i have to redo the stilts for my oil rig all over again cause somehow they where not aligned
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:20:31 somebody flawlessly bypassed the chat filter
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:21:01 is saying swear words as if the filter doesnt even excist
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:23:15 Heres one
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:25:12 why is my chat red?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:40:00 no we all died
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:46:24 so now i have to redo the stilts to my oil rig a second time cause the dang folding mechanics will make it uneven
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:47:03 we seriously need something that allows us to move individual chunks of our build, it would allow me to correct that issue
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:59:36 so im using a method of testing how a fold will work using a motor attached to an anchored block, and i did that, but for some reason one of the four subjects doesnt move as fast as the others
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 05:59:49 all motors are the same and nothing is in the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 06:00:18 so it under no circumstances should it be different
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:35:33 should i work on a brand new, a whole lot better than the original, oil rig, or work on a multi stage rocket carrying a satellite?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:42:51 somebody apparently is my friend on roblox, but neither of us remember ever accepting a friend request by our usernames
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:45:54 you know what would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:46:10 if somebody built a rocket ship to carry the space station into space
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:46:50 im building a new oil rig so fuel prices in crazy planes can go down
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:47:48 i already have one in operation, but a new, bigger, and more efficient one is needed
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:48:08 nuclear fusion is only an experiment
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:48:54 plus the environment to sustain nuclear fusion is just insane
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:49:23 mobile fukushima
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:50:02 gravity is the weakest atractive force in the universe
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:50:52 and you think fusion is crazy, try an internal collision antimatter reactor
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:18 yeah and stars are not dangerous
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:45 big balls of plasma emitting the power of several millions of nuclear bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:51:55 per second
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:52:17 antimatter
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:52:42 a nuclear bomb converts 17% of its energy to an explosion
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:53:15 antimatter when in contact with the matter we know and love releases all the energy form bot particles
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:53:52 the sun will burn helium until is reaches carbon and then the sun will go stellar cloud
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:54:11 the sun needs to be 8 times more heavy to go supernova
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:54:38 20 times hypernova which is 100% chance of a black hole and a gamma ray burst
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:55:38 festus
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:55:51 latin for happy

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:02:45 okay now that i got the silts aligned i just have to connect them and build something to hide the folding mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:03:20 SEOMTHING JUST WARPED INTO THE VOID
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:03:28 srry caps

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:21:45 you died in heaven?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:22:17 what if you glitched the game so hard that a black hole literally formed and destroyed the map
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:22:30 and once everything was destroyed the server crashed
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:23:53 to destroy a black hole you need to increase the hawking radiation to "..." levels
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:24:42 you need to be god
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:31:10 k i havnt been pwned
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:40:02 This is my new oil rig so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:41:02 one of the big bois of the Galaxy discord had sternly warned us to change our emails and passowrds
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:41:10 *passwords
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:45:10 omg it takes a fricken long time to load groups on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:45:22 its not even funny

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 23:53:15 hes trying to inspire a new UI for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 00:03:43 if i could make the drill pipe go all the way to the ocean floor and have a blowout preventer... that would awesome
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 21:35:47 leeches? leeches are creepy
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 21:36:19 you mean chicken?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 21:36:29 KFC is a restuarant
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 21:40:43 time to work on my oil rig after playing with the folding stilts first
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 21:42:02 somebody in the server is trying to make a vtol thomas the train
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:01:37 we need a block that has sides the can be toggled to stick to other blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:02:14 im starting to get irritated with certain mechanisms im building
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:13:15 Why is my oil rig so lopsided, physics say that it should be more balanced. Sire there is that little stair to the left, but that is so small compared to the rest of the rig that im like <:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:18:12 so i cannot flip my oil rig at its current state, because the games balancing physics are obviously broken and then rig tries to drown itself
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:18:30 racist
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:18:55 so its roblox not being sensative
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:19:03 FLIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:19:17 school has severly damaged my brain
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:20:07 Who to blame... Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:20:30 how am i supposed to know
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:21:25 this is not an american oil rig tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:21:55 Pennywise
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:26:08 
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:27:15 why is my username my roblox user?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:27:56 no its supposed to be SupernovaGaming
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:28:45 thats extremely stupid
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:29:00 i put my username the username i wanted
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:29:18 not my roblox username, cause maybe i want it a secret
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:30:25 how do i change my nickname
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:30:47 now im very mad
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:31:35 i seriously dont want my nickname to be my main roblox account name
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:34:37 ironically as we were arguing about my nickname being my main roblox username (which i absolutely do not want) google chrome detected suspicious activity relating to my roblox home page
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:35:20 im complaining cause i dont want that
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:35:59 i'll give my username to certain people when i want to
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:36:11 and its not my pass so dont try
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:37:13 what bot also made that happen?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:40:30 i dont want random people trying to send me friend requests and messaging me, plus i dont fell SECURE (not actually yelling just to get it out there)
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:41:20 you can change my nickname right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:42:28 how about violation of security
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:43:56 it should have a reason to change my nickname without a sufficient reason itself
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:44:25 i seriously do. not. want. my .nickname. my . roblox. username.
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:45:02 also i sound like im mad at a specific and that making me even more uncomfortable
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:45:33 no not that
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:45:52 i truly dont care
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:47:11 i think it making me uncomfortable and violated should be a good reason, plus the no one has a good reason to change it. its not inappropriate or anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:47:36 seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:47:53 -sigh-
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:49:17 i dont like my username being the same every where
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:51:32 i swear in all cases, i would not copy another persons build

plane-crazy 2019-01-19 00:00:03 ideas bout what
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 00:00:27 he already got punished by another mod
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 00:00:34 so dont punish him again
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 00:01:45 i smeel pizza
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 00:01:49 GOOTA GO
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:06:55 WHy do i always have to load in my save from what i was building to get the full build?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:26:32 hmmm.... nearly just exploded the toilet
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:26:51 it probably got a crack or two
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:27:06 at least it wasnt taco bell
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:28:09 stuff is going on
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:29:27 those two half blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:29:46 ooh
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:31:51 the is the one for my creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:32:44 i showed the horizontal one like what you might want
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:34:12 im tryign to recreate what you want
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:35:39 so im testing it and it may not fold together, but let me try again
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:38:51 i dont think they will fold together to align
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:39:20 we need new folding parts to make smaller folds
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:39:28 like powered hinges
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:40:52 okey
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:49:57 is that real?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:50:10 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:50:26 it like a particle emitter
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:50:48 where would it be?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:51:06 when will it be added
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:52:28 he complaining that 1,000 SPS in 2 seconds isnt fast?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:52:44 where did he come from?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:52:55 that is very good speeed
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:54:26 thrusters are so loud in stereo headphones
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:54:35 but it sounds a whole lot better
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 17:59:06 rank for what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:02:11 We need corner pipe connectors so you can connect cylinders without blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:11:55 i have the feeling that someone in our server keeps following mea
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:12:13 which wouldnt be very surprising since anyone can join me in gaem
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:15:11 people are saying the build height limit is gay, which is also a good time to add a stackable gamepass that increases the build height by either 1.5x or 2x
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:15:47 oh yeah i absolutely hate that
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:15:57 the dang keybind glitch
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:16:36 there are two helis flying around and both crashed into a folding subamarine
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:20:20 i got the frame to the folding heli pad on my oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:25:36 i hammer head shark just at a CRJ
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:25:56 and now his lower jaw ripped off
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:26:04 and a plane just flew into me
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:33:48 MY OIL RIG IS UNDER ATTACK BY AN OIL EATING SHARK
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:36:01 IM UNDEER ATTACK MY OIL RIG IS UNDER ATTACK
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:39:56 its not american
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:40:02 its paradian
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:43:06 the oil rig exploded and now millions of barrels of oil are flaming in the ocean
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:43:40 and the blow out preventer is severly damaged so now oil from the reserves are flooding into the ocean
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:44:04 the shark died, and the rescue probably is gone
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:50:59 oooooooooooooooh
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:51:02 its you
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:54:28 LEaR JeT

plane-crazy 2019-01-19 18:55:53 This is my second oil rig and it ahs about as many parts as my first
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 19:09:42 natural gas generators are being installed
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 20:35:29 the official private server link is no longer valid
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 20:38:14 im inn the vip server and a few people recognized my oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 20:50:48 can you make it so in the vip servers what you type in chat doesnt connect to keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:10:11 you could try and use pistons
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:10:22 have an extension feature
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:10:35 like my oil rig next to you
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:15:21 imma build the mud pit of the oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:26:01 is that a threat?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:28:04 <:thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:28:12 that launches cars
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:28:44 the concorde died
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:28:56 just like the A380 is going to

plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:29:21 mine is water based tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:29:39 first vip server
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:29:59 although those rigs are commonly launched form ships
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:30:42 gyroscopic technology
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:30:46 boiz
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:33:43 i figured out what paint blocks are and now my life just got better
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:33:54 search it up
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:34:17 search it up on the fastest web browser ever internet explorer 😉
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:39:13 bootyfull
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:39:31 idk
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:42:57 He needs more build room
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:44:15 yeah vip was being quite rude to minecrafter
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:45:51 where does it say "no ghost pinging mods or admins" in the rules?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:46:31 rank request?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:46:35 he asked for a rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:48:20 quick question
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:49:18 will warns eventually become so old that they get taken away form somebody
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:51:02 didnt vipEmpire at that "noob" part to his nickname once?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:52:09 that was part of his nickname once
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:52:54 before any thing worse happens lets jsut let it be
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:53:32 actually hes not spamming
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:54:12 yeah he posted it twice
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:54:51 if the subject switches it best be to stop this argument
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:55:22 guys lets just stop arguing
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 22:55:38 just go with the flow
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:07:43 i wouldnt call people noobs, cause you cannot tell wether they are being serious or sarcastic when typing
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:08:51 calling people a noob is actually mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:09:17 and they can pick up on it and start calling people noobs
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:09:31 and maybe even you
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:11:03 we need a new text channel for like arguments on the servers politics and a court based channel
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:11:29 calling people a noob isnt a joke
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:11:35 or any other offensive name
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:11:43 unless they can hear your voice
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:12:39 you call people a noob, but vip what you said is actually stupid
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:13:32 it is now in the national school curriculum to teach kids NOT to use offensive words as they can very easily be taken that way
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:16:22 i only want to be a moderator because i believe i can be fairer and more professional than some of the current moderators
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:18:18 i had enough smarts and common sense as a 12 yo that many mistaken me for an adult on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 23:18:23 true story

plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:14:34 ha
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:17:18 inappropriate language big boi
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:19:27 is my username easlity taggable
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:34:59 okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:36:15 my dang oil rig will not balance, even though the center of mass is in the center of the rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:36:21 <:THONK:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:39:36 lovely
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:47:31 Please explain
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 07:59:28 ive been working on trying to balance out my oil rig for 2 hours and its so not working
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:00:26 using anchor blocks would ruin several hours of work
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:01:31 I took this a while ago, and those stilts are supposed to make the rig realistically elevated
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:02:05 only now for unknown reasons the rig wont stay balanced no matter how hard i try
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:02:54 redo the entire stilts with ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:02:58 that may work
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:03:27 right now i ahve helium blocks at the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:03:44 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:03:50 okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:05:34 i have quite abit of helium in the drill tower
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:06:18 what should the ballast density be?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 08:09:18 that will take a while as the other button that sets the settings for all blocks you place of that type doesnt work at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:10:50 -refreshes page with vip server link-
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:12:22 now to replace the stilt tips wiht ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:13:46 why is it so cold in my room?

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:23:10 Got any oil?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:36:10 you need to learn
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:38:24 imma make my psaceship
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:38:30 the MISL 19-21
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:45:28 imma make i 4 blade heli wiht a single rotor
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:47:21 imma build the heli on my alt
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:48:26 what if i verified both my alt and my main to the same disc acc
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:53:57 gah
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:54:10 i suck at building noses to planes or helis
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 19:59:30 how does this look for a nose?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:04:19 go to vip servers and click the pinned messages <@!214072411140784128> for the community server
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:04:27 <#501059272675688468>
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:08:04 i should make a starship
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:08:32 preferably the  MISL 19-21 as i have a lego model of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:11:33 im attempting to build a heli using no propellers, no thrusters, and no jets using a trick i learned before
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:11:48 with the exception of forward and backward movement
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:14:01 wait how will i get the inventor rank if im building the heli on my alt acc?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:14:19 it will look stolen
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:16:44 i will put the rotor on last to avoid poeple copying the idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:26:35 rotors are being put on for testing
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:27:49 SKFJA;
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:27:55 IT WORKS
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:28:16 AND I ACCIDENTALLY LEFT THE GAME SO I LOST HALF THE KEYBINDINGS
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:28:19 BUT I DONT CARE
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:33:19 uuh
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:33:41 my heli keeps spinning out and i dont how how to stop it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:35:03 it also keeps tipping over even though the center of mass is centered
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:35:41 
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:43:22 WHY IS MY DANG HELI ROTATING
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:43:28 ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:43:36 I AHVE THE ... thingy
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 20:51:54 oh my god

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:06:46 every thing else
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:06:51 is fine

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:14:27 people are trying ot help me make my heli stable and keep giving suggestions, but all those ive tried or already have
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:14:40 i keep telling them to check out my heli to see whats wrong
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:15:11 but they are so lazy and wont do anything more than give suggestions that i know wont work, ive tried or already have
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:15:22 and its very annoying
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:16:24 AND THE FLIPPING TAIL ROTOR ISNT NOT WORKING AT ALL ANYMORE
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:16:27 REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:18:17 so the games physics dont allow realistic helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:18:51 
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:19:42 whos an expert in helis?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:20:15 i need him/her
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:20:46 before i destroy the oil economy
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:21:14 im trying to make a realistic heli
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:22:23 im going to be the first to dislike the game because the game North Koreas realistic helis
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:22:36 tis stupid
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:22:46 this is why i own an oil company
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:23:08 but no one will do contracts with me to transport anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:23:50 my heli will NOT SPim!nG
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:24:10 but i have to much patience to stop building
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:25:13 i have some steering control over my heli
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:25:20 WHICH IS AWESOME
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:25:33 (im still going to break something)
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:27:05 :swear_word: :swear_word: :swear_word:
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:29:10 eventually im going ot work so hard on the heli mechanism that not giving me the Inventor rank will be like Slave labor
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:30:54 😖
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:31:07 https://tenor.com/view/explosion-nuke-boom-nuclear-gif-5791468
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:32:19 so i have steering controls, forward movement, and height controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:32:29 with trash stability
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:32:53 how do i F'ing solve the stabilty
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:33:13 its stable until i engage height controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:33:27 then that heli has a sugar rush and starts spinning
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:33:33 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:35:19 the only jets are forward movement
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:35:32 im trying ot get inventor rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:40:47 <:ban:532301642864001052>
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:41:33 until rick makes realistic helis a thing and cures my stage 42974829173907 cancer

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:36:21 -gets hit by texting driver-
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:36:46 -U.S. makes texting and driving jail time with extreme fine-

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:37:49 and what powers it
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:37:59 a chain reaction of springs?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:40:07 The Blue Horizon oil drilling and extraction platform has reached 1000 blocks...
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:40:26 
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:40:54 my oil rig will be a *M E G A C H O N K E R* when its done

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:47:34 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:47:43 i can ping myself
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:47:55 but can i get banned for spam pinging yourself?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:48:09 (myself... whatever)
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:51:10 <@283338701193609217> is that the North Korean flag?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:54:01 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:54:19 wanna know something
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:54:34 Integex
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:54:56 that is normal for drag cars and F1 racers
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:55:05 but the spoiler is supposed to stop it
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:55:31 that looks more like the millisecond after a nuke detonation
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:57:26 <:omegalul:528987216643489792>
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:57:38 there was an AFK plane stuck in my oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:57:51 and after several test spawns
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:58:14 he flew into the ocean at a speed that would completely destroy his plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 00:01:20 omg
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 00:01:40 i pressed spawn and my rig was taking so long ot start loading that i though i deleted it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 00:02:07 also its taking so flipping long to load
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:26:20 me  trying to figure out why very suggestions will get added even though they get a lot of attention
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:28:06 I just realized that im screwed
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:28:40 ive built 2 oil semi-submersible oil rigs
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:29:06 one is partly anchored, the other is free floating, but none of which have actually controlled movement
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:29:52 (unless there are ocean currents, cause my first one used to have a system that keeps the rig in one plane despite the currents pushing it)
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:31:27 (the only physical connection to the ground was the drill pipe which is like pushing on something attached to something that cant move via a soggy twig)
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:40:02 who is spamming?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:46:49 using to many fold systems (and the relative size of my second rig) i might end making the largest, not deleted due to purposeful lag, (semi) static structure in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:47:13 i may also run out of save space
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:48:10 we need not traumatic folds
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:48:21 or a special block for folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:49:07 i have no idea how taht will owrk
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:49:18 but we so need motorcycles
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:50:02 he means he wants to be able to spawn in the red mountain area
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:50:24 over der
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:50:56 😒
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:51:00 very stupid idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:51:28 i dont know where invisible motors will work
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:51:41 or how they will make the build look less traumatic
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:52:08 furniture is good
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:52:21 bigger wheels>
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:52:31 just use 3x3 cylinders nub
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:52:52 we need wheels that take up less space
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:53:16 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:53:26 just go the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:53:38 actually thats impossible
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:53:47 the game is to blocky
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:54:24 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:58:47 wtf is a hover pad?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 05:59:02 why have i never heard of those before
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 06:00:59 make a gamepass that makes the build height go <:upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 06:03:27 https://gyazo.com/b4b28df41a933bfc633cda48ff519ebd

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:00:05 i saw no ping towards devs
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:00:51 they aren't even online
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:03:27 maybe there should be a rule not to argue with mods or admins, if you have a complaint about how a mod is treating you them DM a higher ranking personnel.
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:05:10 I got muted for 3 hours for spamming with no actual *definition* to support the reasoning
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:05:31 i looked through two english dictionaries at home and 5 online dictionaries
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:05:40 and then i laughed at the mod who muted
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:06:28 just mute them for a couple of minutes to let them cool down
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 18:07:23 just mute for like 5-10 minutes if they start arguing to help them calm down

creations-chat 2019-02-07 22:27:47 first of all, it reaches the hight limit. Second of all, the base floor doesnt touch.

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 23:56:04 on plane crazy

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:00:14 or like a plasma torch
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:00:42 cause breathing plasma would kill you due to the pressured explosion from the heat
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:01:24 plus plasma lasts barely a second in atmosphere in the first palce
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:02:13 i just like naming everything wrong with anything and how one thing can be explained
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:02:17 in other words

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:03:23 then why did he ban him
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 00:03:28 did he find more?

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 21:59:55 im going ballistic already
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:01:06 does rick actually look at the suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:02:29 its to laggy to use the fly glitch and now i cant take that good angle pic of the escape boat i made
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:03:24 it actually doesnt seem like it
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:03:48 i see so amny good suggestions that i would put on a list of things to add for my game if i were you

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 20:54:19 notice that planes are american
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 20:54:43 cause the first plane was made in the U.S.
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 20:54:55 West virginia was it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 20:56:17 they flew the first powered heavier-than-air aircraft and flew it in North Carolina

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 21:09:08 cause he is so slow to fix the most useful item in the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 21:09:23 reminds me of Cars 2 the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 21:13:28 its very hard to know whats not been suggested and what has been
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 21:13:58 plus sometimes we need multiple of the same suggestion jsut to get it added due to popularity of that idea

plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:34:45 i hate these arguments
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:35:00 seriously
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:35:08 these arguments are now out of control
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 21:42:11 trapdoors are now falling of my ship even if they are properly connected
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:18:24 "high" was censored out of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:19:03 supposedly anyone with an age on their acc under 13 cant say it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:19:16 even if they mean in terms of height/elevation
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:29:45 i ahve to go to a new vip server cause the one i was in was getting way to laggy

plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:53:12 how do you make a
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:53:21 controllable
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:53:43 i cant get this thing to actually not do constant back flips
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:54:06 (now that i think about flight, i may have came up with a partial solution)
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:54:44 i have helium blocks in back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:54:54 though i could move them further back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:10 we know
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:17 we all know nub
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:25 thats all everyone says
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:34 so stop talking about it
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:44 literally everyone knows
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:53 plus those are landing gears
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:55:56 not wheels
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:56:08 unless you mean the prop
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:56:20 those are tiny landing gears
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:56:34 they're a separate entity
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:56:48 just to get that clear
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 22:58:08 you have a anfpiabfiuspahdnj imagination

plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:17:46 -spams ballast blocks at max density in front-
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:18:08 it did nothing
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:18:14 the cneter of mass dint move
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:18:39 unless rick did a 10 IQ and didnt account for mass when making the center of mass detector
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:18:52 looks like an ice breaker
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:34:46 roblox servers are melting
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:35:28 omg
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:35:35 the dang game isnt loading
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:35:48 every single time my brother plays polyguns
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:35:55 everything exploded
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:39:08 hey
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:39:10 hey
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:39:14 hey guess what
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:40:19 has rick added a save revert system yet?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:40:59 cuase lag just completely destroyed my 1.5k ship build
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:41:03 my space ship
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:41:12 so i kind of need the save back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:41:17 if he hasn't added one yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:41:31 is there one
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:43:05 i do
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:43:08 trust me
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:43:31 so has rick added a save revert system?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:44:06 -adds rick to list of not smart people-
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:44:13 there is so much room for error
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:44:34 i dint think he added that nub
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:44:42 i was just asking if he did
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:45:18 but if your like me who looses his thousand block saves to lag
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:45:33 better add a save revert system
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:45:55 i lost this
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:46:02 with no chance of it getting back
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:46:15 not really
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:46:25 its curvy and is quite complez
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:46:36 how about inside
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:47:11 ik
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:47:19 but he should add one
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:47:28 there is a decently large community
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:48:24 what about my second oil rig
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:48:32 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:48:48 and 40 hours of work
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:49:07 sure my ship only took about 5 hours to build the hull
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:49:24 but the inner workings are complex
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:49:32 even then it would work right
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:49:36 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:49:41 dude
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:50:06 you couldnt even build it because of copying rules
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:50:15 plus you sound like your exxagerating
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:50:55 no matter how hard i try to believe it, it DOES NOT sound possible
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:51:29 how would you like to loose a multi-thousand block build
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:52:11 you shouldnt loose any build due to glitches period
bug-reports 2019-02-21 23:54:12 lost this 1.5k block space craft due to lag. I also lost a 2.4k block build due to me not paying attention. A save revert system should be top priority over glitches as it can help combat glitches
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:58:03 now what to build
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:58:26 dude
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:58:28 stop
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:58:46 stop going after me for the save revert system
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:10 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:17 i disabled it to save space
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:28 its not my fault
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:35 its the stupid lag
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:47 go loose your builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 23:59:52 see how you liek it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:00:20 thats your doing
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:01:29 yes, we have slow internet
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:02:12 he can see when your typing you know
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:04:04 the build wouldnt even load fully before
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:04:14 so i rejoined the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:04:32 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:04:39 it only happened once
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:04:45 so i rejoined to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:05:23 idk
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:05:41 everything is broken between roblox and plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:05:57 i could just have the unlucky gamble
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:06:08 i ahve 2018 HP

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:07:17 can you read
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:07:21 thats what i thought
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:07:34 my computer would have no issue
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:08:20 i liek ti
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:49:57 so after the save incident with my space ship, i have decided to dedicate my main account to building random junk, and my second account to building the oil rigs
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:58:40 prt sc
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:58:46 normal roblox screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 17:00:15 How come i cant figure out a good way to make this fold

plane-crazy 2019-02-24 22:08:06 when its completed i will need a partner to help test it as the selling point of ship is one that is outrageous
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 22:08:25 and probably never has been done before
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 22:08:59 you will need to be inside the ship to test it
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 22:11:08 the build is now over 3000 blocks large
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 22:11:26 flight capabilities are decent

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:37:45 or what ever the plane is called

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:38:34 fit me?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:39:07 
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:44:45 okay
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:44:59 so my ship is confirmed flight capable
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:21 i got a 3200 block monster in the air and saying in the air
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:26 however
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:47 stability in climbing are quite low
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:50:22 stabilty of my ship has most likely increased
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:50:27 along with control
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:50:58 fix the issue with loading
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:51:10 my ship will only load once in a server and go flop from there
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:51:24 wont load at all afterwardds
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:51:49 omg my typing
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:52:37 how come im having 0 motor glitches
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:53:07 and im having the most irritating glitch ever
bug-reports 2019-02-25 23:53:26 why hasn't it been fixed then?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:54:14 what?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:54:25 no, obviously
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:55:51 the engines on my ship take a friging long time to actually get to full throttle
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:57:44 either my ship is to heavy, i dont have enough thrust, or both
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:00:31 ey?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:02:28 my ship has two layers of 7 block beams
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:02:38 not the best armor
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:03:58 where did the second warn come from?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:04:56 how about a short range shotgun with lower damamge pool
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 21:36:23 stupid school
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 21:36:35 i dont like school
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 21:37:05 but at least it gives me time to imagine planes to build more creations and work on current projects
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 21:38:26 imma extend the frontal section thruster array to improve maneuvering and speed
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 21:38:56 Who lives in Colorado Springs?

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:11:07 once my ship does that, the server is to laggy to revert
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:11:11 so rick
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:11:33 please make the land in front of the spawn area completely flat and then it drops
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:11:43 no bumps in the way
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:12:33 then how will i load the cargo inside?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:13:17 landing that thing over the mountains and then stopping just above stall speed would be like
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:13:24 <:eyes2:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:14:04 then having room for take off would be like hacks
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:44:43 hmmmm
bug-reports 2019-02-26 22:45:01 the bug is obvious
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:45:16 found a glitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:48:06 for the cargo hold, should vehicles be placed in the front of my ship or the back?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 22:48:23 back is by the cargo hatch

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:03:20 
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:03:27 look at those upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:03:44 it will even allow me to finish my space freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:03:48 that is already to big
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:07:12 ik, but it would be so crazy useful
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:07:21 and the upvotes on it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:08:22 <#498473314445033472> more likely to be seen
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:19:03 question
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:19:30 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:21:21 wright brothers plane?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:22:01 rick, how many upvotes does a suggestion have to get before you decide to add it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:22:47 thats unfair
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:23:03 that also seems a little lazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:23:30 36 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:24:04 plus any other non-discord member, inactive or those that may have not seen it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:24:13 that want it in-game

plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:25:35 also im pretty there is no such thing as cross-player connections
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:26:08 magnets suck at welding
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:28:12 couplers connect with other couplers
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 23:28:25 only without the attraction to each other

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:00:25 excuse me rick
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:00:38 that spawned with active anchor blocks
bug-reports 2019-02-27 22:02:09 I spawned with anchor blocks. Last time i remember i was supposed to spawn above the water, not completely submerged destroying most of the cargo.
bug-reports 2019-02-27 22:02:43 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:03:11 dont mind me destroying the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:06:26 f word
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:06:38 now the thursters broke
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:07:09 im sueing rick for destruction of private property

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:07:48 i cant test in water cause is spawns under water
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:08:08 half the thruster array is no longer on on/off mode
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:08:22 which means i ahve to tear it apart to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:13:01 why does it seem the admins are very likely to downvote on most suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:13:19 i keep seeing admins downvoting suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:13:59 what would the old engineer ranking system do?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:14:16 having all creations have a chance at the rank
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:14:25 instead of just planes
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:15:14 cause plane crazy sounds catchy
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:15:45 unless your trying to discourage imagination in the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:15:51 its quite sad
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:16:27 spanish boost ad playing
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:21:36 glitches are annoying
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:21:49 plane crazy glitches are my mortal enemy

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:29:18 that is very mean as your insulting my dream to be a roblox dev
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:29:35 im not worried about scripting
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:29:45 just model construction and landscaping
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:30:18 i could always learn from the other scripts
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:30:43 ik
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:30:55 i know how hard scripting is
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:31:59 Retail Tycoon and Lumber Tycoon 2 are great examples of *INSANE* scripting
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:32:55 make the game more stable, smoother, more organized in the studio
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:33:37 but not very efficiently
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:34:35 your looking at the dude with experience in modeling
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:34:40 include unions
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:35:44 its called "training"
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:35:50 he could do it in off time
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:38:43 i have so few free models in my game compared to the work i have done
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:39:23 we should carry this into <#497142796961054721>  before the cops show
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:39:46 calm down
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:40:24 calm down
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:40:39 and stop heavily swearing in all caps

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:03:57 island nations
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:04:15 north korea is the exact opposite of illegal immagration
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:04:28 south korea has no illegal immagration
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:04:54 who said it was contreversial
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:05:19 i have oil
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:05:43 thats hwo you kill a conversation
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:06:08 roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:06:29 wait is the loading glitch roblox's fault or ricks fault
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:07:06 most likely rick's fault as the script that spawns the builds may be broken
general 2019-02-27 23:07:42 see <#497142796961054721> came along and the conversation died
general 2019-02-27 23:08:25 i dont like plane crazy government system
general 2019-02-27 23:08:34 but i cant do nothing
general 2019-02-27 23:08:42 no one can do nothing
general 2019-02-27 23:09:14 unless we form a literal army of people and storm the chats
general 2019-02-27 23:09:23 but that would be extremely hard
general 2019-02-27 23:09:37 -USA joins the chat-
general 2019-02-27 23:10:37 my development channel has no slowmode in general chat
general 2019-02-27 23:11:14 and even though that channel was made for anyone interested in my games
general 2019-02-27 23:11:28 general chat in it is reserved for talking
general 2019-02-27 23:11:34 just talking
general 2019-02-27 23:12:32 
general 2019-02-27 23:12:43 general chat of my channel
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:13:25 why is <#550286359064084480> private
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:13:34 why have it at all?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:13:47 not really
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:13:54 well yes, but no
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:14:08 general is un-safe
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:14:42 so we have to post in general cuz the chat room designed for reporting is blocked
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:15:27 whats rick doing?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:15:57 i ahve him bookmarked
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:16:24 no u
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:16:42 rick isnt even online
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:17:37 are you being racist?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:19:57 i only remember one other warning

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:24:01 to heavy back
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:24:15 (obviously as thats where the bridge is)
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:26:13 im crying
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:26:29 im so sick of the stupid loading glitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:26:39 its worse than motors
bug-reports 2019-02-27 23:27:58 are you another one who built an oil cause i decided to build like three?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:32:04 that glitch were you load and the speed bar is stuck at infinity and you have absolutely no control over your build
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:32:14 and you have to rejoin just to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:32:34 happens on large builds that have folding sytems
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:32:52 like builds that have over 3000 parts with motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:33:17 i dont know how to avoid it or to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:33:37 i believe its a bug in the script that retrieves the build
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:35:50 i am seriously getting annoyed by it
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:36:07 high priority glitch mode activate
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:36:21 i cant stand it no more
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 23:37:04 i seriously cant
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:25:27 i saw link to galaxy
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:25:48 vipEmpire is now my fried cuz he like galaxy
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:26:02 i have a Leviathan in that game
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:26:24 the best non-vip/limited ship in the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:41:57 so im mentally disabled cause of
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:42:01 *school*
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:42:09 please dont ban me for saying school
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:42:25 how did it get cancelled?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:43:19 what is "yaw" in flight terms?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:44:37 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:44:42 im on my main
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:44:49 and i dont even have an alt named that
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:45:10 -goes into underground bunker-
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:51:55 who me?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:52:20 what did i do?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:52:24 i did nothing
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 21:54:06 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:01:30 omg
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:01:46 im so flipping tired of the stupid loading glitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:02:24 how come, after the first time loading my ship, it will not work
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:02:29 every single flipping day
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:02:51 good reason for a rewrite
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:03:00 that would happen a whole lot less
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:04:03 i know for a fact it a problem with either the loading script, or the script that retrieves the builds from the data banks
bug-reports 2019-02-28 22:06:52 so, if a rewrite happens, please redo the loading scripts and the scripts that retrieve build data to load them as that is most likely what is causing the glitch where large builds will spawn the first time, but after that absolutely nothing works on your build at speed is stuck at infinity
bug-reports 2019-02-28 22:08:37 i know for a fact its a problem with plane crazy and not roblox's fault cause how many games have pretty much the same system of loading. Examples: Lumber Tycoon 2, Retail Tycoon, Theme Park Tycoon 2, Pool Tycoon 4, Miners Haven, Space Mining Simulator, and much much more
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:10:22 so, i cant play plane crazy any more
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:10:33 until rick fixes the issue with loading large builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:10:47 i have lost all my patience
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:49:24 imma paly lumber tycoon cuz i can
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:49:53 is grab online
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:50:10 not yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 22:50:21 only if its close to a page long
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:07:58 dont go in vip1
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:08:05 its going critical
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:18:28 most likely not
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:19:05 you know how that goes
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:19:11 *badly*
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:19:25 thats how rick invents new enemies
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:21:22 who knows how ion boosters basically work
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:22:33 rick uses his dev powers to make gravity that pulls stuff down
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:23:16 no the roblox gods gave him the power
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:23:43 wdym you improved the speed bar?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:24:01 that was America's fault
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:24:57 you should make it so the speed bar tries to find the max speed by determining the thrust to weight ratio
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:25:15 how do you know?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:25:26 i mean with rick it will
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:25:51 that was your fault
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:26:15 not really
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:26:38 filter?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:27:00 which did absolutely nothing
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:27:16 everyone knows that roblox breaks the games
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:27:46 why cant you report inappropriate builds?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:28:10 so then change the script
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:28:34 well tons of other games dont have that issue
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:29:23 you most likely use an easier style
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:29:30 which is common in exploits
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:29:54 i know nothing about scripting
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:29:58 only how it works
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:30:04 in basic form
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:30:25 where did i say your basic at scripting?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:30:37 js?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:31:06 javascript is like 99% of all scripts
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:31:18 in other websites
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:31:45 scripting across all languages are the same but lua is universal
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 23:32:49 same

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:00:14 ViewportFrames allow you to render 3d objects into a 2d GUI
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:00:32 so you can render in the blocks when you hover over them
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:00:41 although there are few uses for it
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 22:01:36 i ned somthen to du

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 22:41:12 complaining how parts rotate slightly when cloned
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 22:41:25 from 2014

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 22:41:45 good thing to
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 22:42:05 builds would probably break if the cloned parts rotated when spawning

plane-crazy 2019-03-15 21:21:24 bully
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:06:33 requesting permission to build the true server crusher
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:06:56 i say crusher as it will be massive
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:07:09 and IT WILL kill servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:07:31 but it will hopefully be the largest flying folding creation
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:07:49 what is the largest folding creation that flies
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:08:21 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:08:36 how many blocks is that
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:08:55 hoe ma good
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:09:00 that is massive
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:09:09 where are the folding seams

plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:10:21 my fingers are going jelly mode
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:16:27 im constructing the scaffolding for what im making
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:16:46 so you can begin to understand the scale of what im going to build
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:18:41 why do i keep hearing a sound come from the game that sounds like the hunting oscillation SFX from Jailbreak (sound of the train wheels hitting the  tracks)
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:20:20 wish you had the option to select multiple blocks by either dragging a selection box across your build or do the ctrl - lmb like in studio to select multiple parts
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:20:45 then i could copy the scaffolding and place is on the other side of my build
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:21:41 OOH
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:21:48 i have a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:54:58 i have doing this for 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:55:04 see lets ragdoll drop

plane-crazy 2019-03-16 17:57:22 You know its big when it needs scaffolding to build properly
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:00:53 what happened
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:01:00 why are there two
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:01:23 -german for what-

plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:02:32 rewind 2018
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:02:41 presented by youtube
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:02:53 dont be a youtuber btw
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:03:11 unless you have a million subscribers
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:03:37 cause you can get a copyright strike jsut by saying "hi" in youtube
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:03:51 (not actually true, but it still is)
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:04:36 now how am i supposed to build the ship
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:05:25 also i should add a turntable to turn my build around after spawning so i dont have the issue with my MT-1

plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:28:59 
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:29:09 the big one?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:32:34 so while i was murdering our toilet, i hatched a plan to make the secondary engines on my ship a whole lot larger
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:32:46 but it will push the ship fromm 5 planned folds to 9
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:34:03 im so obsessed  with the addition of Rythm onto my discord channel
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:34:33 imma start building the frame of my ship
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:36:57 so i am now scared of the sheer scale of my ship
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:37:10 even though i have the bow sketched out
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 18:37:16 im still a little scared

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 22:51:02 im not a fan of tanks, planes, boats, or cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 22:51:19 really im into stationary builds and space ship
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 22:54:26 i prefer a setting that rotates motors in proportion of the mouse cursor

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:06 that means that the plot is two and a half blocks high
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:20 wrong measurment
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:05:30 a 1x1 block is 2x2x2 studs

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:50:42 btw katze
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:50:50 i crashed the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:51:36 im immune to power puff girls
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:51:41 after time it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:52:34 its an excuse to argue with the TV
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:52:39 that wont work
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:52:54 im virtually to anything related to TV
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:53:32 i live with a cat who nickname is taco bell cat
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:54:02 a sad number of suggestions get accepted
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:54:13 its truly depressing
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:54:27 rick doesnt accept anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:54:43 do i see dramatization
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:55:02 quite a few suggestions would really benefit the game
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:55:31 i know that as i think of all the bad and good for everyone in future persepctives
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:55:44 thats trash
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:55:48 but yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:56:01 it would be beneficial for PVP
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:56:07 like what
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:56:10 other than abuse
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:56:19 massive abuse
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:58:13 cant ell if jameson is either supporting shield blocks or discouraging them
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:59:42 i see trollgenius suggestedconnecotrs
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 21:59:48 let me find that one pic
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:00:04 
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:00:23 look at those likes tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:00:45 how does that be denied
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:01:05 yes i know it would take a while and would be hard to script
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:01:32 but at least add it to possible updates
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:01:50 fuel is an interseting idea
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:02:03 but it would break tons of builds
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:02:09 its not a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:02:32 wasnt that like 4 months before mine
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:02:58 so it would be near impossible for me to know unless i asked
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:03:15 and i made a description on how it would work
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:03:37 sometimes you need to try again to be noticed
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:04:06 so in other words 99.999...& of all suggestions have no chance of being added?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:04:13 cause thats the impression im under
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:04:45 i only suggest good/beneficial suggestions to that benefit the community too
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:06:06 this suggestion argument is very contriversial
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:06:43 and controversial arguments have me on one side strongly so i try to avoid those arguments
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:06:53 glitched
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:07:25 fly very high, jumped down, and like 2 seconds before impact i deployed my parachute
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:07:31 like fly very high
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:07:38 make a soup of helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:07:53 fly up for about 5 minutes or so
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:08:09 jump down and right before you hit the group deploy your parachute
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:08:22 that is assuming that still works
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:11:27 we need a large ocean that connects to the lake via a river with a small water fall
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:14:04 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:14:16 i need to split the scaffolding in two
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:14:27 jsut to accommodate my ship now
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:16:28 whos scared
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:16:31 dont worry
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:16:40 there will be a second fold
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:17:16 making this thing large enough to be a runway
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:17:23 like a realistic runway
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:17:28 im not telling nobody
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:17:55 it wont be
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:18:54 it would most likely get me the server inventor rank
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:19:05 server inventor?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:19:07 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:19:14 oaky
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:23:59 my ship hit the 2000 block mark

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:38:28 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:39:42 you know that either the entire game will have to be transferred onto your terrain map if it gets accepted
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:39:53 unless this is the start of the rewrite
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:40:06 terrain loading?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:40:14 wdym

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:50:29 will there b fuel tanks that increase fuel capacity?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:52:16 there must be fuel tanks to increase fuel storage, and thruster type and sizes most likely take different amounts of fuel
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:53:31 why is there an orangeskii emoji?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 22:53:36 <:kek:532300771769974827>

plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:10:31 is it possible to build the same thing from a picture and get to same models?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:10:37 it probably is
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:03 anti copy blacklist makes your build invisible to blacklisted people
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:28 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:31 erm
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:35 maybe
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:55 that depends if your build remains invisible when spawned

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:45:01 i have arrived
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:45:43 soundcloud keeps spamming me with adds for their premium service
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:45:53 i literally have no money to get anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:45:58 other than matchbox cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:47:59 i literally will have enough room to have full services in the beast
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:48:42 some hates i just dont understand
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:48:48 like pinging and jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:48:54 especially jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:49:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:49:23 i dont understand the hate behind jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:49:40 i understand the community point
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:50:15 i got banned from roblox for one day cause some 12 year old decided to report me for killing him
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:50:33 ne it hasnt
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:50:45 how is jailbreak pay to win
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:50:51 really its more skill
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:51:00 sure there is bigger duffel bag
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:51:25 but that just means more time waiting in the bank allowing more time for police to get you
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:51:43 the only gam passes is the swat and crime boss
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:52:03 how is badimo bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:52:26 at least its more balanced
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:52:37 im bad at being a cop
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:52:47 to much junk
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:53:00 why
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:53:06 thats a very dumb reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:53:43 i dont see a reason to stop playing jailbreak cause they added some cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:53:59 and
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:05 jsut grind more
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:10 still a dumb reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:13 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:15 campers
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:17 gross
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:31 the cash is extremely overpriced
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:54:37 to buy alone
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:55:09 lowering the price by a lot will result in more income
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:55:20 becuase mroe people will buy the cahs
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:55:48 i think there should be a gamepass for a higher build limit
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:55:55 even though i have no robux
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:56:21 robux isnt very useful in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:56:34 i have never had any robux
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:56:58 i dont feel broke
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:57:22 not really
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:57:28 not if you ahve no use
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:57:40 now your judging
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:57:51 no one likes people who judge
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:58:09 i didnt say i dont like you though
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:58:31 i mean judges of justice are good
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:58:52 who is not funny?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:59:00 what are you talking about now
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 20:59:22 still
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:00:06 even if its constructive criticism, people can still feel bad about them selves
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:01:30 never got into tradelands
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:01:42 i dont see the point in tradelands
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:02:50 
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:02:56 dont not move in folding builds
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:03:03 or that will happen
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:03:17 also im tired of the build area
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:03:39 if not very good
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:03:43 omg
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:03:49 i can not inglish
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:04:05 also wish you could rotate your builds while building
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:05:28 do not ask
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:05:44 also why is the move tool so unresponsive
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:05:53 it almost never works for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:06:56 rickje is bad at coming up with ideas and amking them not break
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:07:43 i ahve 5 blocks of room to lift my creation
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:07:50 so why cant i lift it
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:08:29 so rick wont fix it cause you can yourself
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:08:35 even though msot people dont know how
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:08:52 is it jsut me or almost all devs like that
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:13:46 shirt stealing is a bad business strategy

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:43:14 noobaris
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:43:19 check the dang server would you
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:43:26 it may have snapped
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:43:50 did i kill the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:44:21 im literally stuck
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:44:35 i cannot respawn but i cna move my camera liek normal
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:45:12 vip1 died
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:45:24 vip1 is unresponsive
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:45:40 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:45:47 i will kill those servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:46:09 definitely
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:46:37 ye vip1 is totally ded
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:46:55 i killed vip1 guys
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:06 so the void kills servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:16 rickje139
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:33 you need to make it so builds judt dont break into individual peices when players die
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:39 it will save plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:59 by removing 2-8000000000 free moving parts
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:22 i only know spaceships
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:28 i know no boats
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:35 (other than oil rigs)
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:49:15 off-topic makes no sense now
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:49:25 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:49:27 i agree
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:50:20 i did on accident
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:50:28 sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:50:35 i didnt mean to
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:51:00 i jsut vip1 for no reason what so ever
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:51:30 how come plane crazy is by madattak
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:51:49 what exactly has madattak done wiht plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:55:06 imma work on interior design
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:55:26 i have this much room
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:58:26 what did i do
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:58:40 i didnt even crahs the server on purpose
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:59:06 plus builds really shouldnt have to fall apart when the owner dies
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:59:20 so it mostly ricks fault for making that a feature
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:01:46 do you think that map project will ever be added?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:02:26 really
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:02:40 if you can make a better map then do so
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:03:15 okay then
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:07:31 block her
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:10:50 i will need to clean the saves soon
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:11:26 i jsut did an oppsie
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 22:11:54 imma go explore the world of the public servers

plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:02:49 this cant be happening
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:03:01 there is another simulator on the front page
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:03:32 also why did mad city do an alien invasion
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:03:44 dont they know that jailbreak already had one
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:01 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:13 it doesnt even have simulator in the name
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:20 dynamic ship simulator?
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:30 im not a fan of those games though
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:04:46 ouch
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:05:09 what will the next contest be?
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:05:28 @notmoderators
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:05:33 whats the next contest
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:05:58 vehicle simulator isnt very relaxing
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:07:25 why do you think jailbreak is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:07:41 name them
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:07:59 grindy?
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:12 thye added a level system
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:27 which rewards you with skins, wheels, special bases with special cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:41 and allows you to see where all the servers players are
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:50 cars
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:09:05 quite a few people
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:09:19 they added like 20 skins in the last update
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:10:09 this next update they are adding a new prison for players that have something 4,000 or more bounty
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:10:14 harder to escape
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:10:22 idk why they are adding one though
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:10:25 i see no point
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:10:52 they still did add stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:11:16 i think now they may go into weekly updates even after mad city dies
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:11:24 plus they may have jobs or college
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:11:45 actually jailbreak mentioned a level system before mad city did
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:08 as they have wiki page that shows possible updates and current ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:12 and twitter
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:27 so mad city is kind of copying jeilbreak
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:43 im not a fan of the front page
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:55 i agree with turbo
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:12:58 quite cancerous
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:13:14 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:13:27 jailbreak really needs a gui rewrite
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:13:39 i ahte jailbreaks gui
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:13:57 i only really like jailbreak and PF
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:14:13 and mining sim, LT2
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:14:48 i should like play galaxy again
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:15:00 i ahvnt in like forever
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:15:45 one good thing about jailbreak is its run by two close friends who ahve been developing since the beginning of time
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:01 so the game is mostly broken by roblox
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:24 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:31 forgot blackbird was  my friend

plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:50:29 so, for wierd reasons i have to go to a meeting to determine if i need counseling or not
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:50:35 i dont think i do
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:50:42 as im mentally stable
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:50:48 (to some extents)
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:51:16 stuff
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:57:21 anyone notice that mad city doesnt know what a tank is
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:57:28 they literally added an APC
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:57:41 A+
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:57:55 where?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:10 where?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:47 THEY CALLED IT A RHINO TANK
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:58 -dies of laughter-
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:59:36 how did they do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:59:54 they could have put the actual name of what they added
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:09 or came up with a suitable name
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:26 i have played it
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:55 i have Aspegers, so i pretty much cant play it
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:01:07 sensory overload
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:01:11 like actually
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:01:39 i cant play mad city due to excessive noises and VFX
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:02:29 its a decent model
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:02:39 just the wheels look like paper
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:02:54 the tank would be immobilized if the wheels got hit
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:04:25 dont touch purified's build in vip1
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:04:34 it causes extreme lag if you touch it
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:04:48 with a chance of physics engine meltdown
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:05:07 probably will be low
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:05:33 mad city tries to hard in some cases
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:05:37 to many noises
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:05:44 to many visual effects
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:06:00 and i have Aspergers
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:06:02 so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:06:21 i cant play without freaking out
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:06:42 prisoner
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:08:05 sounds like mad city
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:08:21 mad city is not bad, but the devs try to hard
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:08:41 that phone thing is unoriginal
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:08:50 the robberies are unoriginal
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:09:01 with the exeption of the robbing place
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:09:33 the boat is unique, but it is the same idea as the cargo train from jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:09:56 the night club is unique but both police and criminals can make money alone
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:10:09 just like the passenger train from jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:10:25 bullet?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:10:37 jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:11:09 they did an alien invasion
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:11:20 which jailbreak did like a year before
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:11:42 the phone idea
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:11:51 vehicle simulator
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:12:16 it helps mad city that jailbreak gives teasers a week before the update
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:12:42 items get crafted automatically if you ahve the materials
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:13:11 which reminds me of minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:14:03 good job
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:14:12 now figure out how to aim
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:14:26 (which took me like 50 shots to actually hit someone)
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:14:36 which was my brother
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:14:50 he is not bad at dodging
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:15:21 in jailbreak i kill him very quickly (like literally everybody i kill quickly)
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:15:30 but in mad city
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:15:44 i struggled to hit him
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:15:51 eventually i gave up
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:17:17 do you know him?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:17:43 if you dont i would call the police
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:18:18 oh
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:18:26 irl?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:18:34 oh k
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:20:11 scp?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:20:23 wat dat?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:21:06 their speed boats
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:21:13 what did you expect

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:30:24 dont worry
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:30:27 its moving
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:30:35 the ship for sure is unfolding
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:42 once i have the secondary wing engines on
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:47 i go vroom vroom
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:56 and a freaking high amount of lag
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:34:17 like 5 ish people are literally wathcing as my ship unfolds
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:03 perks of cinder block folds
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:07 they dont move as much
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:17 but they can get stuck when testing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:28 also i killed another server
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:40 for the bendy people
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:36:49 stupid Keralis memes
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:37:21 i killed a public server
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:37:29 its completely frozen
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:41:38 wth is flipping lag
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:41:50 HWY IS THIS ONLY PRESENT IN PLANE CRAZY
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:42:04 i like plane crazy and i like what rickje is done
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:42:20 but i dont like what he does in terms of bugs and glitches
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:43:02 OMG
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:44:30 there is a glitch where in laggy servers, you can walk and let go, but you still keep walking.
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:45:52 it doesnt happen anywhere else since player walking is localized,  meaning that even in laggy servers for other games, you let go of movement keys and you stop moving, no matter how laggy you are
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:46:15 it literally only happens on Plane Crazy from what i know
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:48:41 also any build larger than 7000 blocks will not work after spawning once in a server, it will load but you wont be able to control anything at all. It was fixed before, but it only happened for builds larger than 1000 blocks
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:48:46 now its 7000
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:49:28 the only thing you can do is rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:50:33 why do i always find to worst, and stupidest glitches in the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:50:52 and i found the same glitch that made me leave the game for literally a month
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:51:37 the stupid glitch where large builds stop working after using them once
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:51:46 the only way to fix it is to rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:52:24 i already stopped palying for one month because of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:52:32 and it may happen again
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:52:46 the point of fixing a glitch is to end it all together
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:52:54 not make it less likely to happen
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:05:35 i wanna play a song but that song will have to wait for like 8 hours to paly
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:05:46 and i cant clear the que for it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:06:00 and i cant revert lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:17:15 im literally 45 blocks off of 8000
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:21:14 what is the largest build ever constructed
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:21:19 by block count
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:22:04 whats the largest build ever constructed by block count
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:22:42 cmon
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:22:45 i wanna know
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:23:18 🍔
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:23:54 whats the largest build by block count?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:24:27 was that just a box?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:24:52 whats the largest build with actual use
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:25:14 100k vtol
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:25:22 how do fit that
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:25:36 how does one have an actually functional one

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:32:40 rule 10 is kind of racist if you think about it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:32:59 you could just have language specific chat rooms
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:33:19 but then moderation strain
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:33:34 you guys wont understand what anyone is talking about
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:34:01 maybe because they have no idea how to get to the discord
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:34:11 since they cant speak english
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 19:35:16 guys

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:20:41 everybody pick on rick
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:21:09 thats good in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:21:17 it means less broken junk
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:21:42 and im sick and tired of all the glitches that happen when rick joins
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:22:37 time to build the secondary wing engines
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:24:00 found a new glitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:24:17 its red
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:24:26 look
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:24:29 its all red
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:25:08 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:25:18 its a glitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:25:24 the time is locked
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:25:36 so it cant be light
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:26:09 its all the way up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:26:18 https://gyazo.com/a4a13dfc85716ac786a35b8cf0ca8a92
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:26:38 wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:26:47 its the blacklist glitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:26:57 which is even worse
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:27:04 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:27:14 RICK WHY HAVE YOU NOT FIXED IT
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:27:40 everything going through my head is literally saying rick is lazy
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:27:50 that or he is very bad at bug fixing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:28:33 he is online literally everyday
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:28:41 so that isnt a valid excuse
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:29:13 anyways
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:29:18 it is so freaking annoying
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:29:35 i just hate how rick manages glitches
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:30:40 maybe after he updates the game he should prioritize all major glitches and bugs
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:30:46 except the fly glitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:31:02 i like all that rick has done with the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:31:04 i truly do
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:31:36 but just all the glitches that have been present for entire months is truly dumb
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:32:05 there was also a lot of ads
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:32:15 i only found the game from an ad
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:48:36 Beginning work on the secondary wing engines
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:55:42 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:58:08 i can fill that with super thrusters and times that by 2  for the other side
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:58:16 or shouldi mix jets
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:58:27 i should mix jets for performance purposes
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:02:13 *thrust*
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:02:38 now times that by 2
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:02:42 for the other side
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:19:04 
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:19:42 
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:19:48 it no longer stupid
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:19:50 it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:19:53 a god killer
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:22:11 <@511080180966752256> it is not effort
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:22:23 saying that would be a big fat obvious lie
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:23:33 there is a ful interior
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:23:47 plus the original ship is designed for war
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:24:21 i cant break inot my mind
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:24:38 my reference is a full scale design from my mind
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:24:43 and trust me
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:25:03 the original ship is not one to mess iwth
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:25:07 this one isnt
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:25:26 there is no rl reference pic
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:26:30 cause the real one from my mind is scary if your going to battle it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:26:37 unless your small and fast
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:26:48 Galaxy is good
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:27:58 the old game looks old
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:05 like just plain old
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:23 functional economy
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:35 i still play galaxy
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:42 i have a leviathan on it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:45 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:28:50 thats the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:29:00 its available?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:29:03 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:29:31 they took all artifact ships down due to hacking and exploiting
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:30:37 i jsut got a ping from Galaxy
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:30:47 the Kodiak quest is broken apparently
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:31:15 your supposed to take a pic of your warehouse after getting peices
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:31:19 in case it breaks
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:36:11 chat died
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:41:47 this guy is on the verge of crashing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:50:06 my ship is so laggy the rockets are hardly responsive
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:50:24 like you cant tell if the throttle is working
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:50:58 the chance of it flying is higher than me actually being able to get it to fly
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:52:29 im like
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:52:30 so dead
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:52:39 like truly dead
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:52:48 i killed a server with my ship alone
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:52:51 just my ship
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:53:11 8801
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:53:43 the ship is more likely to fly then me being able to get in the air
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:53:59 from just controlling
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:54:49 which means i cant post my 8801 flying build with a full interior
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:54:59 cause integex says its low effort
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:55:22 when really if i had more space i could make it more realistic on the outside
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:55:28 plus he is just jealous
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:55:36 and he likes being the best
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:01:19 so now we're fighting against who is trying to stop an argument?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:01:43 then how come no one has ever fought against me when i try to stop an argument
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:01:45 oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:01:58 no one cares that i exist in the chat
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:02:55 he means stop arguing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:04:37 not really
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:05:05 it jsut means your being a jokester when you post it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:05:15 cause wonder woman's jet is invisible
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:05:28 maybe it wont fly
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:07:44 would my 34 ish block trike ultra-light count
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:00 its really small but it  is realistic
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:18 took a decent amount of work to make as stable as it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:31 (which is actually how stable a real on is)
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:33 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:36 its real
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:08:55 that doesnt seem fair but okay
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:09:28 oh
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:09:36 i thought you mean regular creations
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:10:05 to bad my ship wont be ready in time for the contest to end

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 17:55:59 i feel sad in general due to how many ideas wont get added regardless of how good or popular they are

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:35:39 how come no one will update my user?

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:38:18 everyone who is not says its good
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:38:23 lmao what?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:39:13 everyone in the first discord to update my user said it was good
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:39:24 except one dude who eventually said he was picking on me
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:39:50 limited item
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:39:57 why exactly limited item
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:40:34 also stop judging me because i changed my username to like the only original name left in the existence of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:40:42 and one easy to remember
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:41:27 Did you mean: *Slovakia*
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:42:06 Ukraine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:42:42 i called everyone fishy
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:42:55 see now you dont stand out cause of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:43:31 just the way most of the way people act here can be interesting
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:43:39 so in a way im fishy myself
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:44:14 also there is nothing wrong with finding people suspicious
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:44:30 lmao i dont know what im saying anymore

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:38:14 unless whoever else said my username was bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:38:55 i have the feeling anyone who said my username was said that because they were pronouncing it wrong
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:39:53 its pronounced "Suh-vo-ick"
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:40:05 not "Sah-vo-ick"
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:42:04 who else is getting tired of hearing the word "Fortnite" is just about every insult and comparison sentence?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:45:31 im looking at the development and i dont know what to think about what rickje has done with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:46:37 i see major bug fixes (except the one i literally stopped playing plane crazy for) new materials, and save price reduction
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:47:13 two things being released the make my life easier, but released so late i dont find it worth it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:48:49 somebody needs to encode a message into a picture of rickje
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:49:56 im not seeing it

bug-reports 2019-05-14 20:47:45 when you have infinite fuel on while using any jet or rocket, and then turn it off, and back on again
bug-reports 2019-05-14 20:47:56 that thruster will not turn back on again
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:50:40 concrete is not a material
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:50:50 im being picked on
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:50:59 concrete is not a material in the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:51:59 why are we complaining about minecraft in plane crazy?

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:57:50 what if rickje added plasma/electricity based guns?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:58:10 that put an effect on blocks that amkes them slowly loose health

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:03:12 humans are good at doing stupidly hard junk
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:03:54 reflecting a bullet with a katana is totally possible

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:47:28 thats literally defeating the purpose of a *boat*
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:49:02 now i ahve to deal with folding
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:49:20 folding is like my worst enemy but i use it so often
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:50:46 rip
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:50:57 what are you even making?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:51:40 my crew abandoned me
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:52:08 wings dont work when they are wet
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:52:15 do you even biology?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:52:24 my wings it does
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:52:50 my wings are fabric attached to a wooden frame
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:53:05 a really thin wooden frame
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:53:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:13:40 -insert overused meme here-
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:30:17 how come this turret will not traverse (aim left or right) there is nothing blocking the motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:30:25 it should be moving but it wont
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:30:51 what side block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:31:38 broken hit box
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:31:48 now the turret looks unrealistic
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:32:31 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:33:46 i know
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:34:04 but i cant do anything about it without breaking the motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:45:11 i get annoyed by it, but dont say anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:45:31 i dont get after people for speaking different languages
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:45:40 i jsut pop out google translate
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:48:08 began the extension of the destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:49:39 -casually discovers i can make the deck wood-
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:49:50 <:Hwat:559717069919223839>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:51:17 👌
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:59:33 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:00:09 good thing im building a WWII destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:00:18 so im fast and nimble
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:00:38 makes for a really annoying and difficult to hit target
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:01:23 (plus i have torpedoes ((which will have to be rockets due to the game's limitations)) so i could get you accidentally)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:04:28 its more satisfying to blow a huge hole in a unsuspecting ship
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:04:49 has anyone else made a destroyer with torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:04:59 i know of torpedo bombers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:08 as i was attacked my one
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:26 what does it look like
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:31 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:05:33 okay
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:06:00 im glad rickje added the new textures
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:06:17 mainly cause now the deck of the ship is realistic being wood and all
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:06:43 k imam go to bed
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:06:53 and die in my sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:06:55 kbye
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:02:44 Cosmos is a flower, and that flower is one of my favorites (since when i was like 5 years old)

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:24:35 torpedo tubes (which sadly have to be rockets)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:26:51 uu
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:30:43 this is how the professionals dock
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:45:08 we should be able to change the pitch of the horns
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:45:26 make them more realistic to some builds based off of real life things

help 2019-05-18 22:44:30 how do i stop this from happening
help 2019-05-18 22:44:40 what ever i do the ship flips
help 2019-05-18 22:45:22 i ahve helium blocks on top to pull the ship up
help 2019-05-18 22:45:48 including some in the hull attached to ropes to continually pull up
help 2019-05-18 22:45:55 and yes i have ballasts
help 2019-05-18 22:46:00 in the hull
help 2019-05-18 22:47:16 the ship leans to whatever side
help 2019-05-18 22:47:29 it doesnt matter
help 2019-05-18 22:47:47 especially since ships those small lean when they turn
help 2019-05-18 22:48:11 so if i have the right side balanced and then turn right i will fall to the left
general 2019-05-18 23:06:23 russia didnt win

general 2019-05-19 03:58:52 im listening to the soundtrack from the most awe inspiring, and saddest youtube video in history that literally says "The universe literally isnt worth it... :/"
general 2019-05-19 03:59:27 it is not usually what i listen to, i usually listen to my 156  song long soundcloud playlist
general 2019-05-19 04:05:58 omg some of the songs literally make you tear up
general 2019-05-19 04:06:12 especially if you watched the video like 10 times
general 2019-05-19 04:08:17 what sucks even more is that the music is in order of appearance
general 2019-05-19 04:08:41 so it triggers your prior emotions
help 2019-05-19 04:28:16 k the balancing issue on my boat is fixed if i dont use the propellors

help 2019-05-19 04:28:52 and not turn
help 2019-05-19 04:29:36 other wise my destroyer does what a destroyer is not supposed to do and lean 30 degrees to the side
help 2019-05-19 04:30:21 and once my ships leans there is literally no going back
help 2019-05-19 04:30:41 it will lean to the side and it WILL NOT correct itself
help 2019-05-19 04:31:17 and physics in literally every game should be that it would correct itself and then lean to where there is more weight
help 2019-05-19 04:33:10 rickje has not token any physics classes cause sometimes the physics in the game are jsut not right
help 2019-05-19 04:33:18 or dont exist at all

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:41:32 the ropes are for decoration
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:41:58 the ropes CANNOT move anywhere
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:42:20 they could not have done it
bug-reports 2019-05-19 16:42:47 i dont even know
bug-reports 2019-05-19 16:42:59 its not locked motors or ropes doing anything

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:46:42 or add motors that follow your cursor for some *SICK* naval battles
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:47:28 naval battles and fights with turrets would be so fun in my opinion if that was a thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:47:40 any battle is a lag battle
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:48:22 to bad they are still fun
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:53:20 add another motor to the motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:54:36 these props spin at around 60 sps

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:17:40 i made the turning on my destroyer scarily realistic
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:33 my ship, the RPS Opra, now turns like a real destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:19:13 however the balancing is still freaking broken

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:26:51 i need more balancing for my ship
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:29:52 so somebody in vip1 was testing a cruiser of theirs at the same time as me testing my destroyer, so we had a battle
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:29:58 and i won... somehow
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:30:13 idk what i did but the other ships exploded
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:52 i know those types of hits as citadel penetrations as cruisers and battleships have i special layer of armor inside the ship called the citadel
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:43:55 wish there was a way to change the key binds for guns

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:56:18 I don't want to be part of this confusing online social group conversation
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:15:12 I managed lucidity without even trying
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:16:26 So I gained complete control of a dream I had... at least for 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:18:16 It was weird, but it was still fun to open a glass a door. <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:19:10 I only just learned what a lucid dream  was that day
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:21:10 I have mastered the art of day dreaming, now just to master the art of lucid dreaming
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:22:05 The first thing I want to do is turn into a dragon
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:22:18 Cause I really like dragons
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:22:32 Dragons are cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:24:20 I'm very good at imagining stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:25:25 Throughout the entire dream I had thought control, just couldn't control the dream
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:28:10 Usually my dreams are about exploring office buildings or starting a war because a form of magic I control tends to react with other forms of magic and cause an explosion
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:29:22 I don't remember having nightmares
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:32:09 The closest thing i had to a nightmare was like three or four years ago when this evil lady enslaved half a city and accidentally destroyed a very large skyscraper
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:33:04 I escaped to another island country where is tried to process all that was going on
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 15:33:22 It didn't even scare me irl

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:48:05 somebody built a hanger with a tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:48:14 plus the hanger doors open and close
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:51:46 i made the guy with the tank depressed with the 1/4 completed commercial jet im building
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:52:25 this one dude is scared by the landing gear alone
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:54:02 either jets got a thrust boost, or normal blocks are much lighter
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:54:58 cause the 1000 block front section of my plane has a top speed of 250 or greater
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:56:22 what does your plane look like
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:57:35 the wing design looks unstable at that speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:26 is the wobble up and down or side to side
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:33 or a circular movement
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:59:55 if there was more tail on your plane it may become more stable
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:00:23 the tail is mainly for stabilty
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:01:18 wouldnt larger planes be more stable?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:02:42 i have Aspergers so im better then you <@!557172100545249281>

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:58 magnet drives are very laggy
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:15 just the front section of my plane is 995 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:27 the entire plane im building may get up to 5000
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:50 ya

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:10:28 makes me wish there was a truss block so we can make easy ladders

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:45:51 this is the folding mechanism i installed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:46:01 i have no room to build the plane roof
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:47:38 i hate folds
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:48:27 though i could use a camera guided one, even though i never have done one
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:51:52 imma go to bed and worry about that tommorow
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 16:35:04 i have like 15 dowloaded pictures for my computer background

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 16:47:16 yeah that is normal
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 16:52:42 who here builds during night?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 16:53:02 i feel like im the only one that does
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 16:55:23 i jsut came up with the idea to add vending machines to the game as a joke

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:01:31 birds cant see glass
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:05:27 somebody with brain cells. tell me how to make a fold for this. one that will accommodate the plane roof
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:07:37 "Tell me how to make a fold for this." -Savoic 2 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:08:25 yeah well im becoming mentally unstable because of it
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:09:06 i need a design where the fold will align with the plane cabin
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:13:56 okay i just accidentally pinged somebody
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:14:08 i dont know how
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:14:44 i know how to do a dang fold, but cant get them to align with the plane and still have room for the roof
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:15:01 the best alignment i got was with the overhead bins
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:15:07 180
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:15:15 above
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:15:39 have no room
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:16:13 with the plane design i will use at least one horizontal fold and one verticle
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:16:30 
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:19:20 the plane body is 11 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 17:20:28 as my brain slowly heals from engineering trauma im thinking of a design for my plane

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 18:41:51 he is not a developer
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 18:43:24 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 18:43:27 game broke him
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 18:43:54 the only issue i have with studio is it not logging in from the app
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 18:44:01 i have to log in from my profile

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:03:21 there is nothing like in suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:03:24 i checked
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:03:47 mine was a slider controlling the time
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:04:14 so you could find the perfect balance between blindness and not being able to see
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:06:10 there is a suggestion like it but it was a setting
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:06:16 so you still have limited control
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:07:28 imma suggest it but also include Grab in it since he had the same idea
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 19:08:03 no it hasnt

bot-central 2019-08-31 22:19:30 !colors
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:36:38 I would not understand how being called gay upsets people since it doesnt bother me being called gay
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:36:50 Kevin got banned for causing drama
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:37:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:37:34 being banned is an offense and a defense to the community
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:38:04 he said he going to expose plane crazy for being gay
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:38:36 in other words he was saying gay people were a nuisance
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:39:02 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:40:28 I noticed he had the "I read the rules" Rank but broke rule 3
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:41:01 okay now the rules changed just now
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:41:41 now it is rule 12, subrule of 11
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:42:18 if being called gay makes you cry, then you must not like gay people
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:42:54 also, i have the feeling that was an alt account
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:43:02 the way that person acted
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:44:46 the youtuber he was talking about didnt want to live anymore for being called "gay"???? 😂 that is an obvious lie
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:44:54 that had to have been an alt account
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:45:13 it is very obvious it was an alt
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:45:21 no one acts like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:45:41 unless your like 6, you wouldnt act like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 22:46:29 you know, if that actually is true, he wont survive the first week of public school

plane-crazy 2019-09-02 03:46:38 what are the fuel prices?
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 03:46:59 for 1 gallon of Jet Fuel
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 03:48:29 Thats more like a fighter or recon ship

plane-crazy 2019-09-02 03:50:03 can somebody tell me how much fuel prices are for 1 gallon of jet fuel?
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 03:53:13 i want to know how fast i will go bankrupt
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 04:07:10 for my local airport, it is $4.89
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 04:08:47 THat means if i land my plane at the current max fuel capacity, i will over run the runway and end up in the mississippi river, and end up with a $256,725 fuel bill
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 04:09:26 10 million people have played this game
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 04:10:55 adding to the cost of repairs, the full bill, and whatever fines i get for boating in the mississippi river with a supersonic jet, i now have to repair the front landing gear as the hydraulics broke

plane-crazy 2019-09-02 15:16:34 <@351809528209080324> being parked in the middle of the ramp at the airport for half an hour with the jet engines still running (for whatever reason) means that the smell can wander into the cabin
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 15:19:04 im setting up the economy bois seats
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 15:19:37 so if you have like 1500 dollars for a ticket then you can afford economy class

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 02:13:46 haxorr
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:02:11 a lot of people like to copy
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:02:39 copying from a picture is nearly impossible though
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:03:05 there is still the chance of the lingering human
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:03:28 one that never speaks but still looks through this server
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:03:54 i took 20 minutes for a 2 minute song to load
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:04:10 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:15:48 I wonder if i started the <#617941134605549579> thing since like 2 or three days ago i said i would create my own faction type deal of a discord server
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:16:16 or if was suggested commonly in the feed-back form
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:16:25 i want to know
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:31:10 im making the PCAA look professional despite my lack of knowledge on discord bots
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:31:20 and anything else having to do with discord
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:45:46 WoWS is lagging my computer like heck with the update
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:46:10 So far so good
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:47:27 a little something
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:47:44 a little bit of flame grilled death from the skies
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:52:00 Bethink is a true artist
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 03:52:34 and his modern art hat

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:01:59 but i borke boi :(
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:08:14 i should really move the wings forward more and extend them back while making the engine larger to accommodate landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:08:25 make this looks less like a spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:12:53 the same thing happened awhile ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:13:24 where people got very mad of having a seperate plane crazy only chat room and a off topic
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:15:00 boixy
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:20:23 the suspension on the front wing
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:20:40 looks like it shouldn't be there
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:22:24 btw this is how you use delta control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:22:46 because people before seemed to not know how they worked
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:44:56 i cannot figure out junk right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:45:33 how do i make this engine look good and have room to put landing gear?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:47:54 this is midly infuriating
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:48:48 the wheel is 1.75 blocks long
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:49:47 im going cry
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:52:46 oh my i just nearly choked on my saliva
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:23:52 im just making the engines bigger
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:24:41 i was on a random baseplate and a bunch of people claiming to be youtubers showed up
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:25:05 this one dude claimed he had searched up my username and saw i was in this game and joined me
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:25:16 cuase everyone can join me :/
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:27:00 and i acted like i wasnt real, but made it obvious i was joking
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 05:27:13 however i convinced one person for awhile that i was a bot
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:47:09 wait
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:56:28 how did superidra get a community on <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 20:56:40 he doesnt meet some one of the requirements

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 21:29:34 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 21:30:10 the game engine roblox uses is having to move a lot of entities at once, track the position, and relay that info to you and other players
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 21:30:16 and a whole lot of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 21:30:31 seriously

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:06:07 i would just shutdown the servers

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:06:23 make the game private
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:06:29 then it cant be botted
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:07:18 roblox cant do anything good
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:07:27 well, sometimes they do
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:07:46 but most the time thye either change something, or break something
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 23:08:18 nad usually the change isnt very helpful
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 02:20:27 for what?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 02:20:47 is that the lag fixing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 02:22:34 wonder what people will think of the lag busting

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:45:56 im just going to point it out, its the 25 hour estimated time till the songs start playing
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:49:54 the large shell to the left is the new engine design, the noob on the right is the old one
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:50:56 *casually disconnects from server*
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:51:09 the plane is a supersonic boi
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:52:04 i jsut got an announcement from the roblox discord saying servers are down
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:52:19 roblox completely crashed

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:53:33 current font page player counts
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:53:40 some players still exist
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:53:52 you can see the low counts
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:54:40 plane crazy still has 37 poeple alive
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:56:22 notification time
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 03:59:56 dont servers still operate even when the HQ is out of power?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:01:54 games are slowly dying as the remaining servers update
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:02:55 imma see if studio is operational
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:03:42 i noticed on Plane Crazy before servers crashed, all the builds despawned
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:03:49 then like 5 seconds later we all died
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:04:50 you can log into roblox studio

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:06:25 one of my main games that i work on occasionally is not at all loading
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:06:43 the one game not saved to my computer
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:06:57 or actually there is a backup copy
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:10:01 google wont show me the irl roblox server locations
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:12:35 i just want to point out La Crosse and Holmen are being detected, but no one else, like Wisconsin Dells, or Madison
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:15:30 that is an old pic
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 04:22:04 10 minutes later my game has not loaded yet on studio

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:17:15 the two rear landing gear are exactly the same
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:17:26 there are no extra blocks in the wrong places

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:36:55 and rickje has magical powers called coding
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:37:24 you literally cant get a negative density in the entire world of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:38:03 hydrogen blocks would be fun

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:38:17 but they are explosive
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:39:08 doesn tthe engine power the plane?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 06:39:21 which spins the props and generates thrust

bot-central 2019-09-08 22:32:33 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 22:37:32 sounds like a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 22:50:18 you cant copyright a design
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 22:50:38 you can, however, get a rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 22:54:17 what?

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:39:41 however i can give some of the specs
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:40:02 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:41:00 the one time the pistons dont cause an nuclear explosion, they all dont fire
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:41:24 one piston in the right landing didnt extend
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:42:43 also prt sc still opens all trapdoors
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:45:23 why wont pistons retract
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:45:33 pistons literally wont retract
bug-reports 2019-09-09 03:45:41 okay

bug-reports 2019-09-09 03:46:30 it will extend but not retract
bug-reports 2019-09-09 03:47:32 watch as disable lock on the pistons and then break the entire build
bug-reports 2019-09-09 03:47:55 i dont if it will
bug-reports 2019-09-09 03:48:18 but knowing the physics behind pistons, it most likely will
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:48:45 vip1
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:48:50 vip1 never dies
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 03:49:11 it only becomes inactive

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:30:49 dont ruin it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:31:19 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:31:27 it is bound to happen
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:31:41 yo
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:31:57 us WoWS players should team up and then fight each other
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:32:01 that would be fun
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:32:08 and then do other games
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:32:16 but first i need to get those games
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:33:23 or destroyers
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:33:30 destroyers are small
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:34:23 little dinghy with a machine gun attached
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:36:40 dogfights
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:36:54 or maybe floating base sieges
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:38:23 where you have person who takes a large floating base, goes where ever they want, and then the people who participate in the event look for that base and then try and take it over
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:38:25 OH
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:38:28 that reminds me
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:43:26 **No, it's mine!**
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:44:46 **Even better**
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:46:23 **Space Bismarck**
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:46:50 though helium boats would be very easy to knock out of the sky
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:47:13 its usually first hit kill
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:47:27 the battle has to be longer
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:47:32 not like a draw
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:48:20 ahh shoot vip1 link has changed
bot-central 2019-09-14 02:48:33 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:50:07 lag?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:51:26 explain how i have no saves but still ahve used 257 units of data
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:51:47 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:51:52 no autosave
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:51:57 i never have autosave on
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:52:52 its not a big enough issue for me to take 10 seconds of my time just to report it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:53:02 plus i cant show the entire save menu
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:53:53 all the names are default
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:54:10 yeah they do
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:55:24 everytime you save with a new name is more data took up
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:55:44 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:55:51 its every time you change it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:56:23 my save data is now 354 with one save saved 3 times with a different name each time, and 3 others with no name
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:57:11 i cant prove it in a gif
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:57:27 i would have to create a video or something
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:58:55 wut?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:59:05 gamebar?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:59:23 what game bar?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 02:59:30 what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:00:19 oh figured it out
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:06:36 https://streamable.com/9ansd
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:06:57 watch the save data change
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:07:08 as i change the names
bug-reports 2019-09-14 03:07:41 https://streamable.com/9ansd
bug-reports 2019-09-14 03:07:57 watch as the save data changes with the save file name changes
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:10:25 what the?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:11:08 how did he bypass the thingy
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:11:23 go to <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:11:33 and do ;verify
bot-central 2019-09-14 03:11:51 ;verify
bot-central 2019-09-14 03:11:58 :verify
bug-reports 2019-09-14 03:44:40 why is the save data rising and lowering randomly when saved?
bug-reports 2019-09-14 03:44:46 even then it makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:57:16 imma play WoWS and be focused to death right next to 3 battleships that could all one hit the enemy
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:58:08 i need to painfully grind the omaha out and get the pepsicola
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 03:58:16 with coke and mentos guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:00:03 St Louiseeee?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:00:14 isnt the cruiser with 13 guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:00:39 4 smoke stacks is to general
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:00:48 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:00:53 wrong ship noob
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:01:08 WoWS jsut  crashed when
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:01:10 loading
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:01:28 and so did game center
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:02:25 i just found that pictures
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:03:49 we should build random low tier ships from WoWS and then fight with them
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:04:04 tier 5 or less
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:04:09 like the omaha
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:04:18 the most painful ship in the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:06:41 I claim the USS Omaha
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:08:15 i rememer the day you guys where spam pinging savoic, but not the day you were spam @'ing Sa🅱oic

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 04:09:38 1 fold builds try not kill themselves
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:17:21 that tank has much detail
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:17:35 that is much good
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:25:42 General is confusing
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:26:13 rename it Plane Crazy so it isnt confusing me
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:26:53 because every channel but this uses general as a chat room for jsut about everything

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:45:05 he seems underage
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:45:13 he agrees with the ban
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:45:39 based on the way he acts
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:45:43 he might be
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:46:00 ask roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:46:35 50.000
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:46:47 or something like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:47:40 there is no 8x8 block and you cant take up that much space for 64 painted blocks

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:53:57 no but seriously, i cannot figure out why that is happening
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:54:21 those landing gears are **exactly the same**
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:54:34 they should look the same and be tilted correctly
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:57:42 yeah that is normal
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:59:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:59:12 question life before you know it existed
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 05:59:43 how about questioning life before you had the ability to question at all?

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 06:34:21 you cant move a build up if anything is phased into the ground
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 06:34:54 why cant you move anything even if there is space to move?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 06:35:01 its so freaking stupid

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:54:16 i just broke my computer
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:54:25 the taskbar will not at all show
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:56:59 how does one suggestion get a massive dislike bomb, and then a different suggestion for the same thing gets a lot of likes?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:00:03 
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:00:10 
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:00:40 i still liked zephry's and disliked mine
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:01:08 i will like a suggestion if i like it, even if i suggested it first
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:02:39 i explained mine, and how it would work, got 11 dislikes, and 6 likes, then somebody else posted the same idea not long after, and got 14 likes and no dislikes
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:02:44 with very little detail
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:03:09 people are weird
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:04:54 he said spacecraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:05:00 i said space based builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:05:07 so a large variety
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:05:25 he did say zero gravity
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:06:05 like a gamemode
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:06:17 it would have to be a gamemode
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:06:55 integrating it into a normal gamemode would cause countless issues
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:07:09 <@!313403326081531914> you need to be able to move noob
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:07:21 it would be wings and helium that would be useless
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:08:21 just zero gravity
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:08:27 not the actual vacuum
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:08:52 you would need some hardcore coding to replicate those physics
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:10:17 yes it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:10:34 most likely
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:11:04 you could theoretically change a clients gravity
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:11:45 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:12:05 rick would know
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:12:19 since he has command to change in-game gravity
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:12:28 if you have been in a server with him
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:13:02 he harrased my thicc mobile with a black hole
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:25:04 5630 completed the winter event

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:35:42 removed them and actually got off the ground
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 20:35:55 sure i back flipped into the abyss

creations-chat 2019-09-15 05:23:42 Royal Pitbull A-1

The model of its class. Forged for the intergalactic (silent war that some know about), the Royal Pitbull is a heavy fighter with a high speed, and good weaponry. The ship is semi-vtol, meaning it does have a stripped vtol system installed. It will get of the ground vertically but it will naturally drift forward. Same with landing. The main engines are installed with 2 lave spitters to simulate excess plasma generated by the engines. However, the particles are not fixed, and so will follow ahead of the ship at high speeds.

plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:27:44 also i discovered that using lava spitters will lag your creation out a very lot
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:28:08 which means i will have to remove them
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:28:22 which also means taking apart the ship interior
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:28:54 and then i wont have that nice red glow
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:29:10 this one vip

plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:30:48 i do
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 06:31:30 just because no body goes inside doesn't mean it need to be left alone

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 21:57:51 they are in development and were accidentally released but do nothing
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 21:59:34 water is not a solid object
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:16:52 is it just me or is a certain block missing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:16:57 wedge2
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:17:41 found it
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:17:58 very use
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:21:46 that is oddly satisfying
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:22:01 for me it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:22:10 im attracted to bright colors
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:22:13 like a bee is

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:28:22 weapon accuracy in a a nutshell
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:28:45 that is very much light
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:29:23 maybe the heavier it is the less seizures it has?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:30:23 so the center of mass is still trash?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:30:56 thats stupid
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:31:16 hope rickje is trying to fix that
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:31:34 wdym weak?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:32:35 why do people keep asking about why they have D, E, and A roles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:32:49 do people get it randomly?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:33:29 i know what they are noob
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:34:12 D for development, E for events, and C for contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:35:47 how did you do that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:37:25 its the angle the camera is at
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:39:21 imma just keep the turret to copy onto my build with no use
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:40:03 i will never get inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:40:18 im good enough plagerizing ideas from toher people
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:45:30 oh shoot

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:49:09 i just noticed something
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:49:23 but im not going to say what is
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:49:42 cause i want to convince myself that i may get inventor from
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:50:32 it does not look like a pillow
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:51:08 i though it was a cat's rear end
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:51:48 it looks my cat but with different coloring and patterns
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:55:33 water wheels dont work when attached to no blocks

plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:17:59 my stats and tycoon just got reset
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:18:02 rip

plane-crazy 2019-09-20 01:39:20 who hates it when you sneeze and blow out your tonsils
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 01:39:25 assuming you still have them
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 01:39:31 it is so annoying
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 01:45:15 its your time young one
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 01:45:20 to prove your worth
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 02:42:38 i too like listening to the same 20 second ad for 2 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:16:41 k
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:16:53 i will make sure to watch more anime then
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:19:01 did it sink?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:19:54 target ship?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:20:16 why?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:20:25 just use the dang boat
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:20:33 steal technology
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:20:49 give the Japanese a taste of their own medicine
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:21:34 i would just spray paint targets on a cliff, and then shoot at them
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:24:10 no throwing 5 ton metal slugs at each other?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:25:09 missiles are mainly for anti-air, and shelling right?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:26:12 somebody should start making at least cruisers
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:26:16 with guns with use
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:26:30 and torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:26:49 thats plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:27:04 we dont care about practicalities
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:27:15 its whether or not it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:35:07 i have a feeling
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:35:25 that i may have an allergic reaction to the grass at my school
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:35:48 cause jsut kneeling in the grass is still causing stinging
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:35:57 like 4 hours later
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:36:27 **bigger ocean when**
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:36:48 i honestly dont need a larger ocean
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:37:08 since i dont build any sea-going vessel
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:37:37 i just want to see how many battles come out
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:39:25 the problem is rickje is a one man show
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:39:38 he needs help
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:40:04 like a builder or someone who can do terrain
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:40:24 he released teasers for map expansions in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:41:05 some of us are willing to help
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:41:59 holy cow
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:42:06 is that the original map?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:42:29 looks boring
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:42:40 i like the current map over that one
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:42:45 even if it is larger
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:43:24 i think i have made two map sketches for a new map
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:43:34 one im going by
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:45:15 it originally had a separate dry dock, a really large airport, a highway, an actual rail that would not break your neck, a launchpad, like 4 rail stations, a cell tower (for what ever reason) and a volcano island
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:46:30 now my idea changed a lot, but i still would like a volcano island with an expanded ocean, and a very deep, subnautica inspired cave system
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:47:21 it has lava
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:47:28 but that looks so derpy
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:49:09 i also had an idea that had functions similar to motor 2 and the regular motor, only it looked much better, was slower, but had much more power
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:49:29 and had mouse tracking
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:49:41 never shared it though
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:50:05 you know what games scares me the most?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:50:16 broken motor simulator
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:50:54 and they recently added pistons and mouse tracking motors
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:51:22 *yes you noob*
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:51:36 *are you blind*?

plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:57:06 *dont change anything about motor 2 except speed and torque*
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 03:57:21 unless you want to use it as a servo
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:16:53 i freaking hate the landing gear on my Avin
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:17:06 the front one almost never works
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:17:18 and the back ones wont tilt the right way
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:17:39 the left one will tilt back like it is supposed to while the right one does not
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:17:54 despite being the exact same
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 04:19:50 custom landing gear is really hard to make
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 03:43:24 fine with me
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 03:43:46 i do like the idea of flying warships

plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:38:15 i was originally going for the Rapture, but this ship has a better base
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:38:59 especially for the brand new intergalactic carriers, to support fighters that would others not travel very far
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:40:07 post a pic in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2019-09-24 02:41:05 thats how that works
creations-chat 2019-09-24 02:41:23 *why was there nothing saying saying you need to press leftshift*
creations-chat 2019-09-24 02:42:10 and why cant i plug shift keys into the boxes
creations-chat 2019-09-24 02:42:35 **why cant i plug anything in?**
general 2019-09-24 02:43:03 i cant plug keybinds for photo mode
general 2019-09-24 02:44:07 **why cant i plug in keybinds**
general 2019-09-24 02:44:40 **why am i even in general**
general 2019-09-24 02:44:47 stupid mornings
general 2019-09-24 02:45:18 there is nil in place
general 2019-09-24 02:45:33 what about the second one
general 2019-09-24 02:46:12 why no numbers?
general 2019-09-24 02:46:16 or symbols
general 2019-09-24 02:46:20 that is odd
general 2019-09-24 02:46:39 got it
general 2019-09-24 02:46:42 thank you
general 2019-09-24 02:47:43 but now i need to preplan keybinds more to other things due it activating other objects
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:48:47 omg
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:48:51 my legs are sore
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:48:56 i only ran a mile
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:49:13 like half of what i usually run
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:49:19 everyday
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:49:49 when i think of british i thing of Grian
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:56:33 Kansas is flat
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:56:43 like **flaaaaaaat**
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:57:08 Kansas is Kansas, boring as heck
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:57:20 could do with like a million windturbines
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:58:18 the biggest city i have been to in Kansas was literally a gas station and a motel
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:58:27 thats it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:59:04 you could have just said city and we know what it looks likes
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 02:59:22 every american city is pretty much the same
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:00:09 i keep looking at the map above my desk to look for Wichita, but i forget
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:00:20 that map isnt of the United States
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:00:26 much less anywhere in the world
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:00:48 isnt the Tokyo Metropolitan like 30 million people
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:00:56 NYC metro 15 million
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:01:56 dont speak of walking
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:02:02 its hurts to much
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:02:21 i think i may have messed up my knee a little bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:02:34 i hurt it a little at Cross Country practice
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:02:47 after a 3 way head on collision
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:03:17 could barely walk on it for like a minute
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:03:22 but then i was running again
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:03:29 and now it hurts a lot
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:03:44 hopefully it doesn't tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:03:54 since tomorrow i have a race
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:04:09 *and it just so happens to be at home*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:04:46 really hilly
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:12:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:12:31 its called exercise
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:12:35 noob
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:13:02 k
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:13:20 imma turn on my car emergencies while you sleep
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:13:26 helps me sleep better
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:13:45 knowing that someone may be stealing my car and i can get a new one with the insurance money
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:36:45 https://gyazo.com/1d39c59f2ce4e4edb03bc1d3ba838d52
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:36:56 i added trails
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:39:23 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:39:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:39:57 how long am i going to delay the freaking carrier project i promised myself i was going to do
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:40:19 carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:40:24 a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:40:27 for space
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:40:41 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:41:03 im going to need about 10 minutes to me to start scaling
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:41:37 its to scale
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:41:55 the plots are small compared to your person
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:42:12 but you have a lot more space then you think
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:47:00 is there really a need in a heli-carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:47:26 i feel like im getting sick
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:47:32 or
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:47:41 i have a suspicion
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:48:18 light
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:48:20 durable
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:48:40 it doesn't trigger the OCD i *may* have
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:48:51 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:48:58 autocorrected
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:49:08 ocd was autocorrected there
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:49:57 i feel like mine is noticable
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:50:01 wait
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:50:44 the more simple something is, the more it triggers me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:50:51 i see myself
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:51:53 mainly because i was in control
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:52:14 and it is in a video game
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:52:17 not real life
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:52:32 and my builds are pretty small
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 03:52:48 the larger they get, the more likely i am to work on detail
bug-reports 2019-09-24 03:59:56 
bug-reports 2019-09-24 04:00:12 the camera completely broke
bug-reports 2019-09-24 04:00:48 got stuck when i jumped out my my seat while looking through the front camera on the ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:01:35 i need to sleep
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:01:38 im like dead
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:01:46 in all departments
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:01:55 except spelling
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:02:09 which i am honestly surprised about
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:02:20 do goodnigh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:02:34 maybe tomorrow i can finally start the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:20:29 i want to dual wield flex soemething but my brohter has my kindle
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:20:42 and im so exhausted jsut typing is a stuggle
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:22:11 mischievous look
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:24:12 ready set carrier time
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:24:30 assuming youtube loads so i can lsiten to music
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:24:48 not really
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:01 msot people look for functionality
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:18 i go for somehwere in between looks and functionality
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:57 why so fast
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:09 ground based vehicles kind of need to be slower
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:33 could have just a dive bomber
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:38 or a bomber
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:47 and we would get the same idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:52 and understand it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:28 i have never made a mouse controlled plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:34 could do that with my carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:52 since my carrier is a space based on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:31:05 so mine could use keybind steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:31:27 so then it can be independent from the fighters
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:43:49 will skis be back for the winter event?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:47:09 i should clear out my friends list
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 23:02:21 space saving technique
bug-reports 2019-09-25 02:42:35 honestly who knows
bug-reports 2019-09-25 02:42:45 Plane Crazy is just a rift in reality
bug-reports 2019-09-25 02:43:35 where a bunch of people build stuff on a game for children
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:48:59 Elon Musk
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:49:25 Oil is not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:49:32 if your looking to terraform
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:49:51 you need the carbon emissions to build the atmosphere and raise the heat
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:50:00 who?

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:11:43 im an idiot
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:11:46 for 3 years
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:11:59 3 YEARS
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:12:10 i had never noticed we had 5g internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:12:35 the my mom was lying
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:12:44 or wait minute
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:13:10 you cant just add 5g internet to a router right?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:13:43 we had the same router for 5 years
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:13:59 and yet it has the ability to use 5g internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:14:22 i dont care much about internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:14:26 as long as it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:14:41 and its fast
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:15:07 its not showing up on my computer
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:15:13 yet my kindle has the connection
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:15:20 the heck?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:16:02 life is not making since
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:16:39 Noc
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:16:55 i need to know more about wireless internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:17:14 so i can understand my entire existance
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:18:05 that explains why my mom has connected to 5 GHz internet but i cant
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:18:21 being in the opposite corner of the house
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:18:34 i never noticed until yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:18:39 that we had that internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:18:59 when i had hacked my moms kindle using tricks known as, being bored
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:19:31 but one question lingers
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:19:52 how do i not notice after 3 years?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:20:15 the only thing i know about internet is that it cures my depression
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:20:18 thats it
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:21:00 for me it has to travel through my entire house
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:21:34 from the basement, through the fridge, pantry, wall, another wall, and another, and my entire room
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:21:57 im literally as away from my router as you can be in my house
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:22:24 *which explains why skype is an idiot*
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:22:33 it can barely connect
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:22:41 through my entire house
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:23:18 however
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:23:32 i only can tell the difference with my kindle
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:23:56 from sitting on the dryer as an 11 yo playing one of my favorite games
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:24:06 (which almost always crashed)
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:24:22 to now when i all use my kindle for is youtube and skype
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:24:54 my kindle is older then the time i had my other three
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:25:11 i had three kindles
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:25:21 and my current lasted longer then all the ohter combined
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:25:59 oh shoot
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:26:10 i forget i was trying to launch roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:26:12 oof
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:29:01 i am
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:29:14 going to extend the launch deck
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:29:17 of my carrier

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:24:40 i wish i still had this ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:25:02 gives me nostalgia for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:25:46 it was what kept me in the game i believe
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:26:12 was loosing a lot of interest in the game until i finished this ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:26:41 and it got featured in a YouTube video

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:44:22 that is uuh... lets not talk about that
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:44:28 not important
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:45:14 now this era in my roblox life was really fun
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:45:22 found some awesome games
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:45:37 made lots of progress on my own game i made as a hobby
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:45:43 and killed a lot of computers
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:46:02 i also changed my name
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:46:22 shoot

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:47:57 i was looking for pictures of my 8000 block spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:48:03 that never flew due to server lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:49:16 no hold up
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:49:19 this is the best picture i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:49:35 much different
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:50:07 but now we have the RPS Opra
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:50:13 which i promised myself to rebuild
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:51:00 with the addition of motor2, smoke pipes, and the knowledge on destroyer hulls
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:51:38 epic sunk
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:52:21 oh hear is that oversized ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:52:23 then i deleted it

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:53:36 like 20% of all my pictures
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:53:46 the Avin Fire Bird
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:54:33 Avin D-130
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:55:05 Royal Pitbull
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:55:28 Griffin Fighters (Grievion form Galaxy)
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:55:47 now this
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:56:02 so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:56:19 i just summed up my entire Plane Crazy life
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:56:41 in like 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:57:27 what you be doing there?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:01 i need
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:06 to make a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:09 like WWII
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:11 inspired
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:15 but custom
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:26 cause any large build of mine are always custon
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:59:44 sometimes with inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:01:31 what would plane crazy be like if Rickje had full ownership?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:02:24 yeah faster updates
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:02:36 since we rely on madattak to update the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:02:45 and if he is not online
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:02:49 no update until so
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:03:33 we also could get update notifications through the roblox website, icons, and thumbnails advertising the updates
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:04:41 light mode
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:05:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:05:25 no color
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:05:30 we rely on the black lines
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:06:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:06:33 my question is
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:06:42 why are there no ripoffs?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:07:37 <@220562331606843394> happy?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:14:35 im rushing to get the event items on my Marine_Savoic account
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:15:24 rickje seriously needs help
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:15:47 its wether or not he accepts help
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:16:32 and then get madattak to add some of us to the game so we can build after rick gains trust in the selected warriors
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:18:52 only just noticed this
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:19:01 well, i mean, just came to check it out
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:19:08 i have noticed the sign before
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:19:17 but only just explored this area
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:25:12 you know what im going to
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:25:34 dying is not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:26:08 but im going to build a WWII style aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:26:12 like everybody has
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:26:25 (dont mind me being late to the party as usual)
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:26:47 however im going with a certian style
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:27:24 *Flat is absolute justice*
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:34:15 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:34:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:34:54 there is no indicator as the which way is which
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:34:59 you just have to experiment
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:35:10 usually you fail first try
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:35:21 for what?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:35:48 me preplanning large builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:35:57 gives me a general area to work with
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:37:28 first block placed of my first Carrier that floats on water
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:37:29 not in space
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:38:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:40:55 cannot see what is going on
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:41:17 hence why i dont usually use daytime to build
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 04:50:20 buh buh buh
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:48:41 somebody having fun in a cub
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:49:17 some dude is doing donuts in the air with a piper cub
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:49:27 above my house
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:52:23 *guinea pig noises*
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:52:50 qeestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:53:03 what is a ballast tank?
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:54:54 Everyone at school is complaining about the slow internet, and the teachers think it is because other classes are using it
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:55:04 yet the internet is slow everywhere for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:57:07 our school gives us chromebooks to do school work on
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:57:46 so we kind of have to use the school internet to do work
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 22:58:48 *cause we need to use our chromebooks noob*
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:00:54 our social studies teacher asked our principal or whoever (most likely those in the district offices) if we could use phone hotspots for doing work in school
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:01:11 i assume it was "no"
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:01:25 we can tell it flies
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:01:42 actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:01:49 our teachers are very strict on phones
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:02:02 they also learned to use magic to detect phones
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:02:09 even when they are not looking
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:02:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:02:43 i dont know if its like that for our school
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:02:51 we like to flex on our entire state
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:03:26 *except the presumed idiot on our spec. ed. system that runs the whole thing*
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:03:55 our school lost a lot of students because of the special education director
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:04:04 we used to be in the top 5
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:04:11 if not then at least number 2
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:04:16 until last year
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:05:00 My PC is like a microwave
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:05:30 it is not good, but it is still is better then a toaster
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:06:17 my PC refuses to crash anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:06:26 except WoWS launcher
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:06:30 dont know why
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:06:54 i have an AMD Quad-Core processor
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:07:21 i can barely run modded Cities Skylines
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:07:33 just have to wait 6 hours for the game to load
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:08:25 i need to remove the frame cap for roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:08:31 get that addon
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:10:44 
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:11:49 performance stats or F5
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:12:53 
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:13:28 max
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:13:57 i also have 4 sites running on chrome
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:14:08 one of which is playing music
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:14:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:14:36 i quit roblox and the GPU dropped to 4%
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:14:47 now 2%
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:18:45 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:18:51 what is ballast tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:19:01 i cant experiment till later
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:19:05 in like 3 hours
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:20:36 i think will go for floating fortress
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:20:40 and shipright 4
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:20:56 maybe 5 if i dont get attacked
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:21:42 i wonder... is there any rank for building without a picture to support the design
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:25:29 i just realized
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:25:43 despite how many builds i have submitted
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:25:54 i never requested any designer ranks
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:26:14 i can currently get designer 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:26:47 from my old oil rigs made back in January
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:27:05 and my MT-1 Super Freighter
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:07:44 is there is limit to how old a build can be before you get designer for that build?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:08:26 my tow builds that could get me designer where popular for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:09:01 my oil rigs (specifically my Blue Horizon Rig) and my MT-1 Super Freighter
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:09:38 i made 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:09:48 then many people followed after for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:11:06 although they were more detailed (since my largest build before i started was like 50 blocks) mine actually had stuff like the Drill Tower, Nat Gas burning systems, one had a helipad, and another had a life boat
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:12:00 spandex
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:12:38 *at least rickje didnt allow Rthro*
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:13:39 im forced to go to school
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:13:46 wether i like it or not

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:56 landing, and taking off from my carrier should be easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:34:47 i also, should experiment with working AA guns, and secondary cannons
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:36:13 some the best builds

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:47:49 so did madattak really help with the game?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:48:42 how big is the data compression
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:50:02 so 50% reduction?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:50:25 *use percentages*
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:50:33 *i cant read multiplication*
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:52:01 so madattak is sort of a messenger for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:52:04 he owns the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:52:13 and if he gets enough complaints he will help
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:52:25 other wise he tell rick the issues?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:52:31 is that how it works

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:05:30 i build stuff from my imagination
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:05:48 only one or two builds are copied from a picture online
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:06:46 i watched some simple tutorials back when there was #tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:07:01 only it was to fold
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:07:10 it took me a very long time to learn how to fold
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:08:45 either its a glitch or your being hacked
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:13:08 welcome to Earth

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:18:30 so im not in an area im comfortable with
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:21:48 yes but the flame blowing out the sides is annoying
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:25:05 for some reason the carrier keeps tipping to port
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:25:15 until it capsizes
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:25:44 
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:28:41 there are many fighter het tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:29:25 i am many thing vixo

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:32:37 then you can
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:32:46 otherwise build something else
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:33:26 look up carriers on the internet
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:37:45 hey
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:38:13 did you know that the color picker works on other peoples builds, and blocks placed throughout the map

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:12:18 working on sinking physics right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:12:45 i should move the mechanism to the center of the hull instead of on the side to avoid it being destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:15:38 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:15:42 ballast are still there
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:29:42 what if you took the perfect amount of damage
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:29:54 so that you were invisible

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:34:36 stage 2 of sinking complete
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:34:48 an unwanted frigate has been attracted to the area to sink with me
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:35:04 however the flight deck is preventing from fully submerging
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 02:40:42 i have an epic PfP

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:09:23 d
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:13:19 why is it when the ballast tanks get forced underwater they stay there until you make them lighter?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:13:41 that makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:13:46 <:FixPls:548709302282747914>
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:14:49 but it still works for sinking
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:15:01 *might as well do so if it works*
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:35:13 box detected
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:36:08 the carrier is longer then i though it would ne
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:39:26 looks weirder then mine
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:39:45 why is that carrier in the <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:40:21 yes, but there have been many other carriers that are better
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:40:28 does that carrier have an interior?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:40:41 is that carrier a meme at one point?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:40:54 how many blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:43:00 it was four plots?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:43:04 holy cow
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:43:14 no wonder
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 03:44:47 why?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:11:56 in the afterlife with me
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:39:57 probably your provider
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:43:24 super rockets generate more speed
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:43:46 the normal rockets are power
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:43:54 they can push more
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:44:16 at least that is how i think it goes
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:44:26 but either way the super rocket is much faster
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:55:10 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:55:11 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:06:31 figured out the situation i was in
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:06:36 *now i can peacefully sleep*
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:15:36 make it look like your playing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:18:35 oh

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:19:41 
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:32:48 i feel like guns are too OP
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:33:09 now that i fall victim to them
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:33:29 its causing so much lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:33:57 i literally cannot move
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:34:00 its so laggy
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:34:18 its only been 1 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:34:31 and my entire ship was literally shredded by guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:34:34 just 5 guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:34:50 and the entire flight deck was detached
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:35:11 whilst causing lag that i have literally never seen before on Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:35:43 well some of us have 20/20 vision
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:35:49 and so day time blinds us
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:36:07 even when our display brightness is at its lowest
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:36:31 sometimes having the best vision possible has its disadvantages
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:36:55 omg im never turning PvP mode on again
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:37:04 i have PTSD now

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:37:55 ***and now Roblox stopped responding***
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:38:11 my carrier can be turned into a lag machine with the right junk

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:40:39 i have so many ideas
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:40:59 **HACKS**
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:19 that should be illegal
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:31 we need a timeout then
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:42 like every .1 second a shot is fired
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:51 so 10 shots per second
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:42:25 public server flexing

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:52:57 this is where im planning on putting the smoke stacks
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:53:02 but how should i do it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:53:10 2 out one side
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:53:19 1 out each side
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:53:24 going out and up
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:53:29 or going out and back
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:54:09 i was planning on making the smoke faint, but visible
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:54:28 how come i cant do 2 smoke stacks on one side?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:55:17 i feel like that would be the easiest
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:55:57 okay

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:26:20 thats server lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:26:28 i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:28:37 i need one more smoke stack for my carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:28:49 but im really tired
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:28:54 so i need to go to bed
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:29:09 plus my bladder is sending me hate messages
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:29:32 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 06:29:51 how do you that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:35:07 your carrier was 1688 blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:35:12 mine is twice thaat
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:42:11 my only car
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:42:22 is on my alt account for making ships
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:43:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:44:06 wdym offline?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:45:49 it just needs decent moderation
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:46:11 as long as there is action being took again un de's then he should be fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:47:23 you should still take action yourself
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:47:31 it is still your server
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:50:56 uum
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:51:14 there are servers with like 10000 members that have better moderation then this server
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:52:02 *that is where you fail*
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:52:48 the moderators here are handed picked
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:52:59 and so, we have little troublemakers
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:53:17 you need to hand pick your moderators
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:53:25 based on an application
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:53:46 looking for how **well it is written**
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:54:07 and then have them on trial for a certain amount of time
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:54:14 to see if they're up for the job
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:57:30 i just removed about 400 blocks from my carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 22:58:44 i need to figure out how to balance my carrier with the smoke stacks
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:00:20 *stupid AA mounts*
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:00:35 i might have to remove them to avoid injury
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:07:23 i have created room to make a second smoke stack on my carrier to make it balanced
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:07:50 and extend the pontoons for more stabilization
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:08:07 troll
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:08:24 i made an 8000 block starship
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:08:34 it was very laggy
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:08:46 yet it had an actual purpose
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:09:25 troll
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:09:35 just ask spy
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:09:42 or a moderator
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:09:54 somebody would know if you can register
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:12:37 <@!454809803223465984> Ask a mod, or admin if you can get promoted, then they will join your server to see if it meets the guidelines, then they will decide if you can be promoted.
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:13:10 let a mod or admin be the judge of that
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:14:34 *why would you do that?*
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:15:28 you should still keep them in-line
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:16:05 madattak isnt the main dev
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:16:11 he is just the owner
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:16:14 and yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:16:23 he is inactive
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:17:08 vip isnt a mod
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:17:15 and he will always say no
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:17:40 vipEmpire will say no to anything that doesnt make him look good
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:18:24 troll
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:18:35 ***just ask a freaking mod already***
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:10 ***then stop complaining and arguing***
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:24 i smell food
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:27 so i need to get food
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:34 well troll
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:42 if you read the top of <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:19:48 you would have had your asnwer
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:20:01 then why did you still ask?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 23:20:12 if it clearly said to DM a mod or admin
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:31:07 uum
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:31:22 today was 50 degrees in american terms
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:31:35 tomorrow it is supposed to be 80
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:31:50 the wednesday it is supposed to drop to 40
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:32:05 uum... i like rain, but we dont need that much
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:32:17 even if it cancels school due to flooding
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:33:02 guess not
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:33:31 can you get two ranks for one build?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:34:12 says nothing in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:41:33 how does this work?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:42:29 the ship should be leaning to port
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:42:39 due to more weight being on that side
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:42:46 i have pontoons on the sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:43:14 im more confused as to how the ship is leaning to starboard instead of port
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:43:32 even roblox physics say otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:43:48 oaky now it corrected itself
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:44:00 but how does it lean like that from the beginning?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:46:00 my pc cant handle guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:46:12 yet it can handle everything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:46:49 it can even handle this mayhem
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:47:08 so how can it not handle five guns
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:47:32 that... honestly no one knows what that is
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:47:56 it went from a naval battle, to just complete war, to the boston tea party
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:48:21 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:48:35 <:Duck:606204496695001091>
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:48:56 GET BACK HERE!!!
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:49:30 fine then
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:49:38 i will turn off the water supply
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:49:45 so you cant make the tea
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:50:08 unless you want to use the ocean water which is filled with oil, and fuel, and dead bodies
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:50:20 with a pinch of depression and sadness
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:50:30 and a side a torture
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:51:02 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:54:26 uuuuh... i would suggest leaving
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 02:54:34 who knows what disease is present
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:06:23 just report them
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:06:32 report them to roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:13:26 dual-smokers
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:14:30 the boat is as wide as it can be while looking good, and fitting in with the plot sizes
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:14:43 my carrier is about as wide as it can be
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:14:49 its literally normal
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:15:09 the roof didnt bother me
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:15:46 roblox will tag literally everything
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:16:08 roblox will tag an entire sentence if it has one space in it
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:16:51 ###

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:17:42 <:FixPls:548709302282747914>
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:17:47 yes you can
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:24:13 my carrier takes so long to prepare itself
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:24:32 it will be impractical for PvP
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:24:36 then again
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:24:42 i could just turn PvP off
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:25:10 i would have to build an aircraft elevator
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:25:24 which would add the seizures that the carrier has
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:25:55 **OKAY**
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:25:59 stop it
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:26:26 that legit should not be happening
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:26:41 how do i do that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:27:20 if i put ballast blocks in then the ship becomes un-naturally low
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:27:45 my carrier has never done this before
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:28:39 done
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:28:47 like 5 building hours ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:29:11 wut?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:29:24 i literally cant
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:29:36 i extended them out
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:29:45 and that is what happened
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:29:49 that tilt
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:30:03 is what happened after extending the pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:30:07 yes, i did
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:30:20 i know
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:30:35 it could be the smoke stacks
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:30:51 but those are many testings old
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:31:52 <@!435946988559925248> the smoke stacks could be the reason, but they went through a lot of testing
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:42:48 i was so focused i never noticed i had no music playing
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:43:08 until i saw a colonial style ship which reminded me of the music
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:46:23 now i know why Floating Fortress is a challenge rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:48:02 aircraft with aircraft on it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:48:10 what?

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:58:14 i cant
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:58:27 everything has to be done via weights
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 03:59:42 yeah i did that

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 23:13:32 *i can destroy you*

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 23:15:14 repeatedly
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 23:15:23 it wont hurt *badly*
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:33:58 i like how yesterday troll was wanting to get his fan group in <#617941134605549579> and we said he would not be accepted due to his counter-intuitive  moderation system
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:34:08 and now the professionals here agree
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:34:23 i know
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:34:29 we all saw it coming
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:37:52 i thought about Troll's system to prevent un de's from entering
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:38:32 as a former un de, i can tell you, that we are smart enough to bypass that systen
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:38:47 and effectively lie about our age
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:39:01 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:39:07 it is so easy to bypass
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:39:43 better to have no system, just have it rule, so then the un de's think nothing of it, and expose themselves
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:41:33 troll says his moderation system is good
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:41:50 yet i see something that contradicts that
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:42:16 dont think i could say what it is without being yeeted
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:42:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:42:46 here
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:42:52 auto-moderation
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:45:38 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:46:03 i have a list off words to add to the PCAA auto-moderation
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:46:20 i have a *batter* name for the server
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:46:43 but not sure if it could be re-submitted in <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:59:04 kaaaaa.......
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 02:59:19 un de detected
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:10:55 ***GUNS ARE OP***

plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:30:36 i legit
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:30:47 want to to make weapons for this game so badly
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:31:04 im actually surprised i have not drawn out concepts
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:31:20 you know
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:31:34 imma hop on studio
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:31:40 and make some concepts for later
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:32:56 who wants to be my scaling dummy?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:33:48 i have a plugin that allows me to import people's avatars based on username
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:34:10 Yielding called it first
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:34:22 he is going to be my sacrificial victim
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:34:30 you know what
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:34:41 battleship can be the scaling dummy
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:34:48 i already killed rickje
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:35:02 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:36:55 <@!435946988559925248> is this you?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:40:00 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:57:03 im making concepts
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:57:19 and so is brickzay
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:57:26 however he be doing meshes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:57:31 i am doing hand made
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:58:15 this is more of a heavy machine gun
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:58:59 my concepts for artillery involve the creation of housing yourself
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:59:06 but can also function without housing
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:59:33 although
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 03:59:49 i would like a changing in the gun system
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:00:04 certain shell piercing
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:00:19 some guns damage different blocks based on thickness
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:00:55 yeah?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:01:04 the plots are still the same size
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:08:23 uuh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:08:25 okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:08:36 that is frightening
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:14:40 okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:14:45 im suffering from studio
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:14:52 it wont do the normal
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:14:59 *not welding*
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:10 why am i seeing advertisements on youtube for entire remixes of songs
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:27 like people are advertising entire songs on youtube
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:33 and they are all remixes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:48 stupid and annoying
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:06 somebody is making a helicarrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:16 and im making a space based carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:30:56 making progress
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:12 the gun is at least sticking to the mag
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:26 concept idea for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:44 everybody is becoming bored of the current guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:08 so me and brickzay are making our own ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:28 no idea what those are
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:35 i only know AP and HE
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:34:33 i have ideas for artillery, machine guns, bofors, and missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:34:46 along with futuristic type guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:35:19 Different guns can pierce through different blocks, and can only go so far
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:35:28 others may cause fires
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:35:57 there is a limit on fires
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:37:12 heavy artillery for blasting through thick hulls, machine guns for taking out planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:37:24 bofors for PTSD
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:37:50 guided missles which, are a whole lot faster and you can control
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:05 and tracking missles which go after the nearest block on an enemy build
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:14 meaning you can make flares for jets
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:27 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:32 but they slow
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:52 and those only track at close range
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:39:08 you can have unguided missles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:39:28 i also wanted to make a limited firework launcher
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:39:59 i know
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:40:03 still is fun to make
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:40:12 although
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:40:26 we could always kidnap rickje and force him to listen to jazz music
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:41:01 yeetus yeetus, commit self deletus
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:41:30 YES
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:41:33 i forgot that
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:41:48 i want fuel tanks to explode by some rounds
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:41:59 however i dont care if it is added or not
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:42:13 just something that would make PvP battles more intense
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:42:24 still
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:42:27 fun to make
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:42:43 what
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:42:51 the exploding fuel tanks?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:43:27 it was never going to be added, because rickje had no one to create the weapons
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:43:42 rickje needs help with the game
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:44:03 he is a one man show managing a sandbox physics game
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:44:27 most the time he would be dealing with bugs
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:45:26 uuh huh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:45:36 yet rick would have to do that himself
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:46:09 rick chooses whether based on if it is needed
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:46:18 or if many people just want it
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:46:31 like outside of the PCCD
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:48:52 i need to go to bed
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:49:04 and restart my computer to finish half of an update
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:49:29 since microsoft decided it was a good idea to release a large update and split it in two
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 22:51:12 i had to walk home in the rain
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 22:55:30 use half blocks noobs
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 22:55:35 and half wedges

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:29:55 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:30:12 rick broke motors again
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:30:25 *shocking*
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:31:41 superior anti list and torpedo protection
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:32:43 *i need more pontoons*
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:34:15 *i cant add more pontoons*
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:36:35 no
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:37:04 i like how my perfect folds that have always worked, stop working on public servers
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:38:20 i mean i lied
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:38:26 you cant get a perfect fold
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:38:32 well you can
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:38:49 but it would require a brain much more powerful then mine
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:40:42 the bow needs a lot more pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:46:50 smoke pipes are disabled when you look away from them
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:46:53 that is cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:50:55 by perfect i meant it worked all the time
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:51:26 what is the density of one block?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:52:34 im trying to balance my carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:52:46 it is offset due to the smoke stacks
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:54:02 i am spamming pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:54:17 but either way the weight will be offset
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:54:21 and the ship will list
bot-central 2019-10-02 03:54:49 !rank
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:55:06 Marine_Savoic
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:56:14 you say ballasts are weak
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:56:27 now the ship is leaning in the opposite way
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:59:31 fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 03:59:55 
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:00:37 the beauty of carriers in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:00:47 although they have to be small
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:00:57 they are so wonderful at holding up wieght
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:02:33 G3M3 slid off the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:02:38 with his jet
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:02:55 and completely offset the balance
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:03:01 now i need to wait until it resets
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:03:41 it wont reset
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:03:45 i need more pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:13:55 what about air attacks
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:14:06 like dive bombers
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:14:31 what is the best angle of attack
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:14:39 where you get the most guns on one target
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:15:27 AA guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:16:42 how about accuracy?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:18:31 is your ship made from your imagination
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:18:47 what is the name?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:19:17 okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:19:38 if i were to create a battleship it would be the RPS Dabrorar
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:20:45 12 (4x3) 15.5 inch main guns, and 26 secondary gun turrets
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:20:55 with not very good AA
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:21:27 since the main enemy for the war the ship fought in had a weak Airforce
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:22:07 it would have a max speed of 28 knots
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:22:51 no clue
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:23:15 likely around 70
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:23:25 sps is really slow
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:23:58 im in a public server
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:25:46 i would say im good with WWII style ships, and futuristic builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:26:23 i know nothing about the cold war
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:26:35 other then the USSR hated the United States
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:26:51 and vice versa
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:27:02 and the cuban missle crisis
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:27:10 which scared everybody
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:37:06 one of my teeth has been bothering me
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:37:09 and i dont why
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:43:10 he does have somewhat education videos
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:45:21 <@!352928457358835715> only one block below the planned water line
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:45:28 or actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:45:43 that was momentum
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:45:56 right on, and a physics explosion
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:48:09 my first test with the pontoons and the ship floats right on the water line
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:48:20 also a random motor glitch launched the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:51:19 <@!587406379451678722>
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:53:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:54:09 i just need to see how well it does with a plane lading on it
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:54:35 shoot
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:54:46 i just messed up a fold again
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:55:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:55:28 jsut dont spam ping them
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 04:55:44 mods are our slaves

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:02:03 could you kill a muscle by running it over with a carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:02:08 or better yet
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:02:12 a cockroach
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:03:38 the carrier is really stable and it floats exactly where i want it too
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:03:52 now tomorrow i will ruin that by building the stern
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:03:56 i have to go to bed

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:49:18 motor 1 has always given me trouble
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:49:23 motor 2 has not
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:49:42 i have two servo's
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:49:49 **all have worked**
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:50:23 i will jsut find out on my own
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:50:59 exactly why im just going to figure it out on my own
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:52:00 fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:53:05 i assume it was the game failing to recognize the orientation of the motors
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:53:22 okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:56:18 now the only thing i have to fix is my inability to put in the settings
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:59:32 i think
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:59:46 the issue was i was trying to start the fold to soon
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 23:00:06 cause now that i wait for a little after the carrier loads

plane-crazy 2019-10-03 01:05:14 which i dont want to do
plane-crazy 2019-10-03 01:05:21 mining engineer second
plane-crazy 2019-10-03 01:05:22 ew

plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:35:59 ...
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:36:08 i have so many questions
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:45:50 
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:49:19 or side to side
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:49:31 i guess
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:54:46 they lost both wars
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:54:53 WWI and WWII
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:57:26 the Germans where really good
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:57:33 so were the Japanese
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:57:54 the germans were overpowered
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:58:07 and the japanese quickly got blown out
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:58:34 the japanese had the same idea with their battleships
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 18:58:41 same with the Americans
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:02:46 green
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:04:45 i looked at that an though those where intestines
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:05:42 <:FixPls:548709302282747914> <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:06:57 im going to throw rick off another balcony
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:07:11 motor 2 legit will not rotate the right way
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:07:46 motor 2 is refusing to rotate the wrong way
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:03 it picks and chooses when to rotate the right way
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:15 and sometimes it wont deliver enough power to even move
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:49 i would need to create a 10 minute video to show, and prove that this is happening on servo mode
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:10:50 the fold always will complete itself properly
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:11:15 the first 3 test i did today worked properly
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:11:36 this has happened in the past, but im just now tired of troubleshooting the issue
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:13:08 inverting the rotation does literally nothing
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:13:34 you have to manually invert the keybinds
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:15:41 also water propellers are making no noise
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:16:00 you just have to trust my word that this is happening
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:16:24 since im not willing to go through the troubles of proving the issues with motor 2
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 19:28:34 want some salt on those fries?

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 04:10:59 roblox is streamable, but very glitchy from what i know
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 04:11:18 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 04:11:48 but you are able to stream everything as long as you have something plugged into game activity

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:19:19 okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:19:30 from what i heard, and what i felt
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:19:39 i am not going to like the Colorado
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:19:49 i already dont like the state all together
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:20:34 **yellow**
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:23:33 i could make them higher
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:23:36 but i choose not to
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:23:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:23:52 how did you know?
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:45:36 beautiful

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:47:44 Noc
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:47:52 i figured out what ship you are building
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:48:01 the Amagi
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:48:37 wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:48:52 somebody probably did
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:51:21 battleships could be very awesome if we had much more space
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:51:49 wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:51:58 is the Agaki a carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:52:07 i assumed that
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:52:24 since like all carriers are built on an unfinished hull
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:52:43 or converted from a pre-existing ship like the Langley was
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 05:53:01 collier
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:11:47 so they could use them
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:12:56 cyclone inbound

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:14:02 while russia actually makes better nukes
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:19:13 so
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:19:22 an entire enemy team stuck together
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:19:26 and we lost
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:19:40 after 8 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:26:51 brawled a Lenin

plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:34:42 i dont like it when people vote on a creation based on who made it
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:36:12 the carrier on our team tried to commit self deletus
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:36:24 but he got deleted by the enemy before
plane-crazy 2019-10-13 06:40:47 my american mind is confusing me

plane-crazy 2019-10-20 08:46:01 the part with your brain being dead describes every human being out there
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 08:47:02 depends on the carrier you get
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 08:47:25 stridel just grind whatever you want
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 08:47:38 some carriers are good for some people, and bad for others
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 08:48:45 i approve of the warm bath one

general 2019-10-26 09:01:13 luckily i was in my base to which i had build an external farm
general 2019-10-26 09:01:21 close to enough to save me
general 2019-10-26 09:01:32 otherwise i would have probably died
general 2019-10-26 09:13:55 either i reloaded areas that were outside the chunk loading area of my base, or the resources reset when i left said area

plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:47:33 then you are probably going to be explodicated by torps
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:48:09 destroyers are fast, agile, and get spotted at close ranges
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:48:17 really good at sneak attacks
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:48:39 but you can easily dodge from afar
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:48:51 if you have spatial awarness
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 22:49:20 2 kilometer detection

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 09:24:02 vip1 is depressing
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 09:31:54 i think motors tend to glitch often is because the stud, the motor part, is not solid
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 09:32:04 if it was the motor wouldnt work at all
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 09:32:14 but it would break less often if it did work

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:10:47 madattak needs some punishing
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:11:09 i should
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:11:32 if you check the comments on Tacyon
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:11:36 video
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:11:43 you will see something
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 23:11:57 and i have like two plans on how how to execute the first part
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 08:59:08 no
general 2019-11-03 09:29:10 I hit the citadel of a carrier 3 times with HE shells fired from the Pensacola
general 2019-11-03 09:29:32 in WoWS
general 2019-11-03 09:29:42 *very thick*
general 2019-11-03 09:31:23 actually it is plausable cause the carrier has only like 13mm of citadel deck
general 2019-11-03 09:31:43 so using AP would just go straight through like butter
general 2019-11-03 09:35:09 yes
general 2019-11-03 09:35:20 incidence angles
general 2019-11-03 09:35:29 or however you spell it
general 2019-11-03 09:35:55 how armor to pass through at an angle
general 2019-11-03 09:36:54 there is a useful video on the WoWS youtube channel that would explain it
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:37:16 is that a random number?
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:37:21 you sure
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:39:31 that would mean that my cruiser that i just built as an average top speed of 54.427632 knots
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:39:49 that makes you really rethink the game
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:40:20 as that seems very slow in proportion, but then you are actually going unrealistically fast
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:40:31 average is 56 sps
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:41:33 mine is custom
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:43:04 like 7,500 ton displacement
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:43:31 200 ish meters long
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:43:57 probably 50 feet beam
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:44:18 you said irl
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:44:46 those numbers are too hard to comprehend
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:45:14 however i do know the beam is like 11 blocks counting torpedo bulges
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:45:37 the Yamato is stupidly big though
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:45:48 are you creating a battlecruiser?
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:45:55 or a battleship
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:47:33 who has the best builder role currently?
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 09:55:32 you are suggesting something that is wanted by like human that has ever lived to play plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:13:28 painted the hull and superstructures
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:13:43 also there is a creepy guy in front of my plot
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:16:17 
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:17:54 you have a battleship with camo
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:18:03 i ahve a cruiser with more detail
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:18:54 i am getting so tired of this happening
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:19:48 like every motor2 will start spasing and completely break off the ship to become its own entity that orbits around the motor base
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:20:06 sometimes orbiting past the viewing distance
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:20:15 or falling into the void
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:30:50 NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:44:39 very searchlight
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:48:34 
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:52:00 thank you
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:07:52 the top speed of my cruiser is now 83 sps
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:08:04 compared to the original 56
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:14:09 im not sure im the king of my server, or if im just some extremely rich outsider
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:15:16 everyone is building planes, helicopters or missiles, while i have the detailed ship
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:15:57 not on my server
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:16:05 everyone has some flying creation
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:16:16 although i do have an aircraft catapult
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:16:37 not really
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:17:07 it is more decorative
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:18:27 where
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:19:26 i have no ability to join
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:19:56 Marine_Savoic is the alt im on
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:21:03 i accept request
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:25:24 depends on the boat you are making
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:25:43 or you could make a trike ultralight
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:26:29 <@!608820687334801414>
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:26:36 got WoWS?
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:29:57 cause i was going to play and then you made me join you
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:30:19 somebody said my ship looked like the titanic
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:36:53 rickje honestly needs help in the game
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:37:06 and roblox does not help either
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:37:34 roblox keeps receiving useless updates that break half the games on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:37:47 and some games have literally stopped working all together
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:38:22 if anything we should get a modeller/builder and a landscaper
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:38:38 its loading noob
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:39:06 im on
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 11:39:21 now what is your IGN?

plane-crazy 2019-11-03 12:45:07 thank you
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 12:46:01 i have evolved
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 12:47:18 lol
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:49:22 im serious
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:49:40 the issues with motors are not getting better
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:50:27 i would suggest rickje transfers our saves through the main game to the test server so we can see if motors are actually fixed
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:51:37 and that rarely happens. Like there is no way i can think of to replicate so it would still be hard to do
general 2019-11-03 12:53:06 hmmm... im pretty sure you cant say that word here
general 2019-11-03 12:53:16 <@!587406379451678722>
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:08:06 of course
bug-reports 2019-11-03 16:10:38 if motor 2 is the cause then i have a good plan to trim down on motor two
bug-reports 2019-11-03 16:11:48 in other words remove the useless ones like for the catapult, one in each elevation control for my main guns, and maybe the GFCS motors will be removed
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:11:58 vip1 is full
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:12:04 now it is not
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:12:35 the game has big borken
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:13:22 i had to leave and sit in the queue to get back into vip1
general 2019-11-03 16:16:00 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:16:33 <@!238017332872478720> are you in vip1?

plane-crazy 2019-11-03 16:32:09 so i have depression now
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 22:48:57 sounds professional
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 22:49:54 the railgun that the United States military is testing that completely disintegrates itself for several reasons uses 25 megawatts of electricity per shot
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 22:50:53 3 of which per rail, after which friction erodes the gun past safe usage
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 22:51:22 mainly friction between the shell casing and the rail
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:53:19 and reduce damage by a freak ton

plane-crazy 2019-11-03 23:11:05 *sad piston noises*
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 23:11:38 rick completely neglects pistons
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 23:12:02 rick honestly could have forgot their existence in the game

bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:23:13 also we should like move this to <#384021699466756107> before we get yelled at
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 23:23:35 hello

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 23:22:26 so he can fix them as best as possible
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 23:22:37 act like broken motors is not an issue
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 23:22:54 but still report it
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 23:22:58 so he is likely to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 23:41:11 nevah
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 09:59:48 its so white outside
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 09:59:58 there is so much snow
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:00:10 i does not aprrove
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:43:32 what italian ships from WWII are being made currently?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:49:00 Should I?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:49:01 or is it taken
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:49:34 the Venezia
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:53:14 im pretty sure there is another being made
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:55:51 That is an Italian cruiser
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:55:58 Uboats are quite popular
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:56:08 and i dont wnat to build something that has been made before
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:57:28 Tirpitz is just a glorified Bismarck that no body cares about
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:57:48 im building the Venezia
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 10:58:33 Unlike you guys i like building stuff that has not been built before, or is not that popular
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:04:35 im trying to make a red with a greenish tint
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:04:43 almost like rusted copper
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:05:05 i dont know
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:05:11 maybe i will jsut go with red
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:24:45 depends on what you want to call it
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:25:29 I call manually loaded guns cannons, automatic, or supported (machines help) guns
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:25:38 but the mount is the turret
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:25:49 thats how i would describe it
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:26:11 back then the most deadly weapon was carriers
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:26:31 mobile airports that support hundreds of planes
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:26:49 could go anywhere and casually dump on enemies like a gas station bathroom
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:28:10 for some reason im craving a 5 buck chicken strip lunch from Dairy Queen with a small mint chocolate chip blizzard
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:28:20 with some gravy to dip the chicken strips in
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:30:25 ugh
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:30:32 my nose is bleeding
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:30:34 again
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:33:12 looks like it could be British or Japanese
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:33:58 ironclad
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:34:11 so this was the Pre-Dreadnought era
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:34:35 or maybe it is pre-dread
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:35:10 do those main turrets have only one gun?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:35:33 we need the British here
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:35:36 quick
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:35:40 build a dreadnough
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:37:04 like all dreads had a bad gun layout
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:37:08 but at least it worked
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:37:43 the USS New Mexico changed the layout, and used some pretty awesome turrets
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:38:12 and like every US battleship after that was modelled after the New Mexico
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:40:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:40:38 however gun laynout
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:40:56 and superstructure
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:41:36 still
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:41:46 the layout is still present
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:41:54 even though a gun is not present
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:42:38 Yeah Plane Crazy is not dominated by Shiops
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 11:42:50 we need to change the icon to a boat now

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 12:34:39 <@456226577798135808> in a nutshell, public pvp servers are just downright painful

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:34:08 sand sharks never bother me
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:34:28 i think my biggest threat where i am is wondering bone sharks
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:34:49 as i built my base relatively close to the floating islands
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:35:09 i once traveled down to the bottom of that biome
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:35:16 there is literally nothing there
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:35:30 except endless bone sharks and laval pools
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:35:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:36:06 one was on playstation 4 i had jsut wandered off
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:36:23 nope
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:36:36 i just ignored the ghost leviathans and moved back
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:37:03 and the second time was me looking for magnetite over by the sea treader paths
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:37:29 and in the jellyshroom caves
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:38:13 no

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:42:12 i did
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 10:42:48 you never once mentioned the mountains after that so i guess my brain though we were talking about another biome

bug-reports 2019-11-16 11:13:49 uuh
bug-reports 2019-11-16 11:14:01 i spawned right out in the middle of the world
bug-reports 2019-11-16 11:14:50 no idea why
bug-reports 2019-11-16 11:15:07 however i was teleported to my plot when i loaded a build in
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:15:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:15:38 i glitched out
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:15:45 i spawned absolutely no where
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:17:41 well
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:17:46 if the undo button does not
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:17:50 fucntion
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:18:00 then <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:18:22 a build that large being lost is really game breaking
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:18:32 expecially if you cannot revert the last save
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:18:42 <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:18:47 like 6000 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:20:56 if the save data is to high then it would not affect the save till after he left
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:21:12 *yes we all know*
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:22:51 the flying pancake is all that stands
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:28:42 uuh
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:28:45 dont do that
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:29:12 *hes gonna loose his hand*
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:31:39 <@456226577798135808> you literally just described the point of all of us existing
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:31:44 ***RACIST***
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:34:16 yeah you still have the pancake
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:36:34 or you could build a cruiser
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:37:06 pretty much halfway in between a battleship and a destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:37:51 *easier to torpedo*
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:38:11 battleships are *long*
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:38:13 and wide
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:38:21 so you easily torpedo them
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:38:34 however cruisers break easier
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:38:46 but they can dodge better
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:39:04 *they be dwifting*
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:39:37 and lateral forces from water
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:39:49 is much less on smaller ships like cruisers and destroyers
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 11:39:55 so better turning

plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:39:35 specifically the Iowa
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:39:57 or the other ships like Missouri, Wisconsin, or New Jersey
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:40:32 how so?
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:41:46 They should try and get the Iowa class battleships to their respective states
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:41:53 except the Iowa
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:42:01 since you can not
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:42:17 the Mississippi locks are way to small
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:43:10 New Jersey is in Camden New Jersey
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:43:30 Wisconsin is in Norfolk North Carolina i think
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:43:44 Missouri is in Los Angeles California
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:43:48 no wiat
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:43:57 Honolulu
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:44:12 Iowa is in Los Angeles
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:44:40 that must be the North Carolina class
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:44:42 uuuh

plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:49:18 i make cruisers
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:49:35 not many people do
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:50:11 Cruisers are pretty large
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:50:35 in Plane Crazy a realistic scale model is about the size of the average battleship
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:50:57 <:BottomText:602005011177668641>
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:51:33 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:51:36 people do
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:51:52 still
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:52:10 plus hovercraft dont usually function properly
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:52:33 also everyone wants a bigger ocean so the more ships we build the more likely we get a bigger ocean
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:55:43 Paradian carriers are better at being boats then being carriers
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 13:56:12 *because my country cannot build any functional warplanes*

plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:38:56 boingo
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:39:07 wait
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:39:15 *that is favoritism*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:40:07 found some oil
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:40:23 *lets sink it* -Imperial Japanese Empire
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:43:32 im already visualizing it
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:44:24 luckily Paradians built their superstructures lower so that gives me an adavantage against plot sizes and folding
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:44:40 1x1 missle?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:44:41 wut
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:47:09 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:48:35 what are the requirements for modeller?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:48:47 i know your creation has to have a unique design
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:49:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:50:28 *these mods are deprived of knowledge*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:50:45 oh i just remembered something scary
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:51:05 and it applies to literally everyone who has a youtube account
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:51:17 whether or not they post videos
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:51:31 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:51:48 *only augmented on a really stupid scale*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:52:45 so pretty someone released a video, saying that in three weeks a new ToS rule for youtube says that any account that "does not make money" will be terminated
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:52:56 and the issue is there is a scary amount of evidence
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:53:15 so in other words
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:53:26 youtube plans on deleting youtube to earn more money
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:53:44 because of server upkeep and storage for all the videos and accounts
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:54:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:54:25 they are not worried
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:54:51 *they are just greedier then america with oil*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:55:53 however the wording of the rule also applied this to all google accounts
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:56:04 however that is just poor wording
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:56:13 so dont worry about the google thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:56:26 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:56:52 i personally dont beleive it
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:57:00 no company would ever do that
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:57:50 youtube needs like 10 cents more to its vault of a hundred billion dollars
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:58:16 i highly doubt this is true
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:58:38 since it was only like a 5 sentance paragraph in the youtube ToS
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:58:56 *discord is shutting down*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:59:22 ahh yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:59:28 *Blackmail*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 23:59:47 ^
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 00:00:07 that is what happens when you earn a lot of money
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 00:00:15 yeah there is

plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:05:33 Tesla and SpaceX would just move to Mars
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:06:10 Tesla and SpaceX have the same CEO <@!332615504315416586>
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:06:17 Elon Musk
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:06:43 Elon would try and take both to Mars
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:07:45 Why would Elon want to defeat the chinese?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:08:00 unlike most company owners
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:08:16 why though?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:08:28 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:08:40 that makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:08:47 *ish
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:09:24 Yeah but Elon Musk is an American running an American company
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:09:43 most likely at the time the government would have been stable enough
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:10:10 so it would have been up to the American government to declare war
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:10:23 even if it was on another planet

plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:12:09 There are laws to prevent these large companies from becoming to large
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:12:33 i like the idea
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:12:53 however it is highly improbable for that to happen
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:13:23 National Guard
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:13:39 the National Guard alone could prevent that
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:13:45 if not
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:13:52 then the Police
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 17:15:08 <@!332615504315416586> also those companies at international

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:31:54 did you see how fast you tore through one chunk of metal?
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:32:28 the only time guns are not op is as the form of AA turrets and in dogfights
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:32:43 in that case they are just painful due to bullet drop
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:42:40 <@!210141202698338304> honestly there are no good armor peices
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:43:52

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:46:32 bullet drop needs to be lessened either way
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:52:31 why is it every WoWS song heard in battle i listen to

bug-reports 2019-11-27 04:47:14 time
bug-reports 2019-11-27 04:47:19 i use the dang parachute
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:32:07 i learned PvP is really fun when people build realistically
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:32:15 like public PvP
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:32:26 but it is always ruined by noobs who cant build
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:33:01 or put every single weapon in the game on their builds and then aim them at you
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:33:39 someone in the server i was in made a really interesting contraption that made dogfights super interesting
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:33:52 too bad i did not get a picture
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:34:17 but it pretty much threw explosive balles literally everywhere and they would explode midair
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:34:26 and they had a chance of destroying you
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:34:41 and it gave me WoWS flashbacks
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:34:51 *long range AA cancer explosions*
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:35:33 ahh yes

plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:35:49 i was going to say something
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:36:01 then you ruined it by explaining it
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:38:09 i randomly joined a public server
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:38:19 and it is filled with 12 yo
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:38:36 keep saying "yo mama" in every single sentance
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:07 public servers are breeding grounds for cancer
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:20 which is why they are so enjoyable for me
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:26 im immune to the cancer
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:34 while everybody else gets it
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:37 i can sit back
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 05:39:39 relax

plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:02:35 you lied
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:02:42 just delete motor 2 already
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:02:55 motor 2 is honestly more broken now
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:03:07 then when it was first released
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:04:06 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:04:25 i seem to have fixed it by un-anchoring the gun seperatly from the ship
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:05:06 motor 2 = broken
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:06:00 OKAY
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:06:13 motor 2 legit need to be gotten rid of
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:06:18 or re-write
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:07:43 no joke this is how you should use motor 2
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:08:14 30 is worse
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:08:28 at that point the motor just stops working for me
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:09:12 <@456226577798135808> 99 stops the entire turret
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:09:23 100 will make it rotate
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 06:09:52 but it also comes with a lesson in orbits

bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:03:35 https://gyazo.com/c6cccea49fb4e77bcf5f4f0fd5748cff
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:03:40 watch the middle
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 23:11:56 rick i would say that motor 2 flinging in because the motor move right away when you spawn
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 23:12:00 no other motor does
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 23:12:15 so see if that is the issue with motor 2
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:15:25 Rick, I think the motor 2 flinging when spawning is because, when you spawn, motor 2 immediately starts moving. No other part in the game does this. So try to look at spawning first to see if you can pinpoint the issue.
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 23:16:04 they are broken

bug-reports 2019-12-07 17:10:53 <@456226577798135808> Up above you said that the signs used the normal chat filter. However there are two things you need to keep in mind. Roblox moderation is just trash and you can literally get banned for just playing a game, and the signs make passing the hard to penetrate filter, quite easy.
bug-reports 2019-12-07 17:11:07 And since madattak is the owner of the game

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:39:45 that was 10 years after the government pledged not to build artillery because of its destructive power
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:40:27 they made quite a few nuclear weapons
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:40:36 they only used for fishing
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:42:01 what im getting from this
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:42:17 germany has multiple personality disorder
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:42:56 germany has pretty much always had issues
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:43:23 except in the early 1940's
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:43:33 they had a functional economy
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:43:40 then the soviets came
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:43:46 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:44:21 i like germany because Kurzgesagt makes good nuclear bomb videos
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 01:44:40 even though he has only made 2

plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:25:41 i think that hurts
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:33:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:34:32 i just realized that idra was the only mod to submit anything in <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:35:28 first my group at the top (needs to be updated worse then my browser) and later his own group which he got rid of some time ago for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:35:51 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:38:39 im saving that picture
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:38:48 im going to build that because it looks awesome
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:39:41 whats the jet name
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:39:43 jet
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:39:44 name
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:41:22 i found it on a wiki page
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 02:41:41 its from Ace Combat creativ
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 16:15:22 custom control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:14:19 i made a bomb that has explosive everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:25:53 lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:28:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:28:48 you just said plane crazy is boring
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:29:39 ehh vip could always ban you manually from the ones he runs
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:38:04 public servers are un-organized messes filled with little kids yelling at each other trying to see whos build is better
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:38:25 and then someone joins with a detailed 4000+ block creation
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:38:34 and low-key flexes
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:38:52 and now you just created an awkward situation
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:39:12 which makes public servers fun
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:40:52 i dont have that issue
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:41:13 if you plane is small enough to crash with just a person standing on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:41:19 either you are a bad builder
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:41:25 or you are a bad pilot
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:41:44 and even if the weight is to great
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:41:55 it is easy to knock the person off
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 17:44:06 how any one is able to stand on one of those whilst rotating is a feat among itself

plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:11:02 but they are not after school
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:11:14 so i miss no playing time
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:11:24 like i have to get out at 2:15
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:11:29 so by like 4 i may be home
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:12:40 🧈
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:13:12 i dont know why
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:13:19 but im waiting for spy to come in
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:13:26 and say go to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:13:45 oh i like stupid friend stories
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:15:10 bruh i dont even untangle cables
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:15:21 i know im probably going to die in my sleep
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:15:26 from a house fire
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:15:30 in my room
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:16:20 i have on 1tb hard drive
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:16:38 i cant
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:16:46 cause i have no idea what a solid state drive is
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:17:15 when i think of a solid state drive, i think of solid rocket fuel
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:19:51 >:p
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:20:02 i have friendzoned no one
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:20:07 and have no been friendzoned
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:20:18 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:20:49 wut
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:21:28 i swear whenever anyone says "super" i think they are talking to me
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:21:35 because of my horrible first name
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:21:45 
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:21:51 i have PTSD
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:22:36 
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:24:12 google chrome be like
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:25:09 i dunno why but my FPS does not improve with the FPS unlocker
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:25:55 i get 40 fps on a lonely server
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:26:02 but usually im around 15 fps
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:26:37 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:26:48 not for me
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:26:57 my kindle runs youtube better then my computer
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:28:45 i have 245 processes right now
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:29:34 gaming computers are more graphics right?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:29:44 like GPU and memory
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:30:01 im Wisconsin
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:30:22 i think our taxes our 5.5%
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:30:45 oh wisconsin is 5% sales tax
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 02:31:32 kbye
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:03:38 a flip
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:03:45 *why am i so cold*
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:07:56 noice
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:27:08 a target
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:49:55 i have an idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:49:58 for my boat
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:50:27 imma use the tradmarked Paradian "Valve Full" engine speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:50:43 which is like pumping the engine full of sugar
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:51:07 pushing it to its absolute maximum speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:51:35 (which almost always ends in an engine overheat or critical mechanical failure)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:51:46 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:13 does that even work with servo disabled
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:30 oh shoot lemme try
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:34 i need to see it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:03:41 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:03:47 why didnt i know this before
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:03:53 thank you i need that
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:07:21 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:08:08 however it sadly does not effect the aiming system
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:08:49 the motor will still try to rotate towards the mouse with the max angle
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:08:52 as in
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:09:01 well i cant really explain it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:09:22 if you have played world of warships and understand how the guns aim
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:09:28 thats what im trying to get at
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:09:35 it does not work like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:10:00 you have to rotate the mouse around
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:10:19 instead of just crossing the ship and then the guns go all the way around
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:12:56 the turret above me will not rotate any further, however the to my left has the same max angle setting yet still hits the barbette
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:13:04 so i have to mess around with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:13:31 also i need to figure out how to patch those holes in the gun face
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:15:16 also how do get trapdoors to actually open or close when clicked?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:18:21 dont care for them
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:19:03 germany
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:21:48 i dont build from pictures
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:21:53 i fail
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:21:55 miserably
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:22:00 so i build from my brain
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:22:17 however i do need to start drawing blueprints of my stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:22:29 learn to build from them
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:22:41 im going to anyways
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:22:48 no
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:23:06 i only like building my very own stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:23:17 like i need to come up with it myself
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:23:41 the only build i have made that was not made from my brain was a trashy trike ultralight
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:23:54 oh and a Grievon
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:24:15 this plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:24:45 and this spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:24:54 those were not built from my head alone
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:25:15 none
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:25:24 rick probably forgot about it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:25:40 that or he is too lazy to import one
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:26:55 i dunno why but im obsessed with these stairs
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:29:33 if you front flipped every step you would have a couple concussions and a huge cut in your fore head
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:30:02 if your taller than 6 feet you have to duck to not nail your head
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:30:14 i know
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:30:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:31:07 translate
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:31:15 3 units up
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:31:20 and then 3 units down
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:31:51 1000000 units up, 0 units down
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:31:54 your in orbit
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:34:00 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:34:22 why would he get a warn?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:34:41 oh
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:34:59 the cruiser boi
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:35:00 kk
bot-central 2019-12-17 23:48:55 ?whois Building_Basics (RBLX)#9877
bot-central 2019-12-17 23:49:02 oh wow
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:51:17 why
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 00:55:58 hahaha
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 00:56:02 im dying inside
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 00:56:05 halp
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 00:56:18 gooses
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 00:56:36 sesooG
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:00:45 you need || on each end
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:00:53 for pictures i honestly have no clue
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:02:15 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:02:26 no he is in like 5
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:03:04 did orangeskii try to commit spoiler?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:05:23 you could just harass voxel and force him to add it
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:05:44 why?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:05:50 *did he say*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:06:50 i want to join because i need more steel
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:07:10 *giveth me thy loink*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:07:29 America
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:07:37 oh and the Germans
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:08:13 me neither
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:08:30 i only have an interest because they are fast
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:08:36 they twansports junk
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:08:59 *You have angered the Paradians*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:09:25 *Prepare to be ignored because we don't have 20 battleships yet*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:09:47 *Cause dang Ray Slaydit does not like te boats*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:09:53 *Cause spensive*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:12:10 *Which is a horrible excuse knowing that the Paradians have no government dept, super stronk (but not stable) economy, and they export a butt ton of oil, iron (gosh darn that failed 10 years, nvm) gold, copper, **wheat**, diamonds, aeroplanes, and wood*
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:12:23 oh and steel
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:12:28 dont forget steel
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:19:40 i swear
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:19:45 i better not be getting sick
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:19:58 the last time that happened i like died
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:20:46 i slept for like one and a half days straight, probably had a 104 temp (dunno, had no thermometers)
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:20:51 also could not move
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:21:11 though i did get a free fruit smoothie
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:21:36 you mean the black hole creater?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:25:26 where
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:25:28 is
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:25:31 MY RULER
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:42:14 it took like 3 days to get my group in <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:44:54 Plane Crazy Aeronautics Association
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:45:17 but it was also the first group  in <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:45:29 and the requirements were less strict
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:46:01 
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:47:38 oh you also need a verification boi
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:48:08 he does seem to be working
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:48:49 i never did that
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:48:53 i should have
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:48:57 but never did
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 01:49:05 but it all worked out very well
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:00:40 what
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:00:41 lies
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:01:45 oh shoot you can
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:01:52 wa da hek
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:13:06 Neutron Stars are made of iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:13:07 i like
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:13:11 just noticed that
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:13:25 now for some reason im scared
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:13:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:14:01 because when a chonky star goes supernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:14:12 it burns all the way till it gets to iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:14:18 and then collapses
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:14:24 and explodes
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:15:17 so once the core is iron, it gets crushed, and everything else is explodicated and becomes space dust and knarly space ingredients
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:18:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:18:41 Hydrogen > Helium > Carbon > Oxygen > Neon > Iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:18:43 i think
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:18:48 idk lemme get me a book
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:19:08 Fe is iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:19:47 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:20:11 Hydrogen > Helium > Carbon > Oxygen > Silicon > Iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:20:31 i remember neon being in there
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:20:51 yes it does
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:20:55 stars can burn neon
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:21:07 so it must be under oxygen in the cycle?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:21:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:21:28 neon would have to fall under oxygen
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:21:53 on the periodic table, neon falls in between oxygen and silicon
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:22:25 however i have heard that when a star goes supernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:23:00 gold, uranium, and platinum can be formed from the iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:24:12 it requires energy to fuse
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:24:21 and you get none back
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:24:35 and it is freaking heavy
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:25:53 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:08 there is
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:14 a Hypernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:31 the hypernova is a supernova only with a gamma ray burst
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:39 oh
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:49 there is a way to get a longer life cycle
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:51 dont
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:52 go
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:27:57 supernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:02 in other words
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:04 be the sun
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:13 just burn hydrogen and helium
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:15 the die
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:27 or be a brown dwarf and burn for ever
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:28:53 or destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:29:10 mass
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:29:48 the sun cannot even burn to iron though
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:30:00 only to carbon
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:30:15 <@456226577798135808> you cannot you noob
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:30:34 yes and no
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:30:55 it burns exactly the same as others, however it is midget
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:20 G2-V Main sequence Yellow Dwarf star
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:22 da sun
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:31 stars are stars
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:33 they are big
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:35 hot
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:31:45 and they die and make pretty clouds
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:26 you can have huge stars
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:31 however you cannot
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:32 burn
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:33 freaking
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:34 iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:32:41 you cannot fuse iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:33:48 you can have a star as huge as UY Scuti or VY Canis Majoris, or a star as small as Trappist 1
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:33:54 you cannout fuse iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:33:58 jsut suck it u
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:34:04 the universe is depressing
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:34:22 you cannot give a star energy
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:34:29 once i reaches iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:34:32 to burn the iron
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:35:42 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:35:52 what
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:35:56 i read that twice
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:36:05 stars can fuse iron?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:36:23 well i know that iron can be fused
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:36:35 but i did not know that stars alone could fuse it
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:36:42 other then in supernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:37:14 supernova can create gold, uranium, platinum, and other heavier elements
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:37:24 along with a neutron star collision
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:37:46 finally
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:37:59 boi you need a new brain
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:38:02 or actually sleep
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:39:06 where
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:40:08 wut
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:40:13 do what
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:40:28 so oxygen is radioactive
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:40:49 wait then how do we get gold and other junk
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:40:57 if iron cannot fuse
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:41:04 well i knew that
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:41:14 but it also happens in supernova
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:42:01 and then they make big boom
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:42:38 if stars burned gasoline <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:43:03 if they did american would have sun colonies
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:43:19 cause that is possible
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 02:43:25 stop judging

general 2020-01-07 22:33:41 including getting legal advice from many people
general 2020-01-07 22:43:58 Integex also for some reason said that deleting an NSFW photo and warning him for it it "hating" the Australians for trying to put out their fires that make California jealous

plane-crazy 2020-01-18 22:15:19 only the front gunner does
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 22:15:43 when the fuselage breaks from the wings it falls
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 22:15:48 while anchored
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 22:15:53 yet the wings do not
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 22:19:49 engine died: propeller broken

plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:14:55 instead of saying they are too outdated and expensive
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:15:05 when they are so much cheaper then most carriers
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:17:31 or missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:17:36 just spam those
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:17:41 and those machine guns
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:17:49 you can put a lot more on a battleship
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:20:27 *Angry Paradian noises*

plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:28:13 here are some
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:29:04 the Paradians believe in battleship rights
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:29:12 they have like 5 in service
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:29:47 plus the original omega chonker Linvia class battleships
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:29:59 with 4 18.4 inch guns
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:30:06 or 4 turrets
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:30:09 with 3 guns
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:31:13 nah im outside of the internet service range
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:31:24 so i could not get thy pictures
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:31:34 that and i would scare the United States

plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:32:05 actually
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:32:11 i could build it
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:32:19 the chonker linvia
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:32:59 Linvia and Aspenea [As-pen-yay]
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:33:25 they are pretty much the same except one sunk
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:33:31 in 5 mile deep water

plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:38:38 and then super big boom
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 18:39:17 unless you were the Dabrorar which lost most its main guns to that explosion and still floated

general 2020-01-20 22:50:34 ew
general 2020-01-20 22:50:36 noob
general 2020-01-20 22:50:38 slow
general 2020-01-20 22:50:58 you didnt even travel dimensions
general 2020-01-20 22:51:48 you have to do this
general 2020-01-20 22:51:55 or have like a stupid fast speed
general 2020-01-20 22:52:09 phase shift or bust
general 2020-01-20 22:56:44 if the prow is the front end of a ship, then they are correct
general 2020-01-20 22:56:52 the bow is literally the front end of the ship
general 2020-01-20 22:57:17 and a bow is also a weapon made from a curved piece of wood and string
general 2020-01-20 23:02:13 maybe the bow has two correct terms like the stern/aft
general 2020-01-20 23:02:18 the back end of the ship
general 2020-01-20 23:05:12 what is that  really wierd parkour course where you are in a ball
general 2020-01-20 23:05:15 in space
general 2020-01-20 23:05:26 and every object has its own gravity
general 2020-01-20 23:05:39 so you could jump up, and hit another object
general 2020-01-20 23:05:50 and then you would be on the object
general 2020-01-20 23:06:02 so essentially you are upside down, but you are not

general 2020-01-25 21:43:50 also the coronavirus spreads only by human contact, by saliva (like basically every disease), and mucus
general 2020-01-25 21:44:04 so basically do not go out in the public
general 2020-01-25 21:45:08 i have to go to school
general 2020-01-25 21:45:18 the government is trying to murder me

general 2020-01-25 21:45:58 blood
general 2020-01-25 21:46:17 a basic surgical mask wont protect you
general 2020-01-25 21:46:39 as the disease can pierce the fabric, and get around the sides
general 2020-01-25 21:47:22 you need one of those special surgical masks that filter the air, and are fitted to your face
general 2020-01-25 21:49:16 <#497142796961054721> is for basically everything
general 2020-01-25 21:49:23 basically
general 2020-01-25 21:49:36 not the common cold
general 2020-01-25 21:49:44 but the strain of virus reponsible
general 2020-01-25 21:50:08 5 strains of the coronavirus, three responsible for a cold
general 2020-01-25 21:50:21 Vietnam is already infected
general 2020-01-25 21:50:35 Capatilism is sick too
general 2020-01-25 21:50:38 and Socialism
general 2020-01-25 21:50:54 my ideal economic idealogy
general 2020-01-25 21:51:22 Socialism is the best of both worlds
general 2020-01-25 21:51:32 besides tax rates
general 2020-01-25 21:51:36 but then again
general 2020-01-25 21:51:57 50% tax rates is no different then 5% rates in the US
general 2020-01-25 21:52:30 no

general 2020-01-25 21:52:41 free schools in socialist

general 2020-01-25 21:56:47 *Carriers*
general 2020-01-25 21:57:15 Battleships are impractical because they are less effective as a warship
general 2020-01-25 21:57:36 they can be cheaper and easier to maintain then an aircraft carrier
general 2020-01-25 21:57:45 also building

general 2020-02-05 03:59:07 tutorial battleship
general 2020-02-05 03:59:12 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
general 2020-02-05 03:59:14 okay
general 2020-02-05 03:59:40 because somebody would copy a 5000 block creation
general 2020-02-05 04:00:15 really?
general 2020-02-05 04:00:28 bruh people are that desperate to look cool
general 2020-02-05 04:00:54 i never actually watched fish tanks tutorials
general 2020-02-05 04:02:17 roblox needs to fix the anti bot system
general 2020-02-05 04:02:22 it should be their problem
general 2020-02-05 04:02:25 not the developers
general 2020-02-05 04:02:55 pontoons on the side
general 2020-02-05 04:02:58 helium on top
general 2020-02-05 04:03:14 with ballasts on the bottom to keep ths hips at the desired level
general 2020-02-05 04:03:26 pontoons?
general 2020-02-05 04:03:39 they should be out to the side
general 2020-02-05 04:03:50 also the hull shape plays a big role
general 2020-02-05 04:04:14 flatter bottom hulls naturally will tip over less
general 2020-02-05 04:05:07 your ship on its own wont tip over
general 2020-02-05 04:05:17 it is much wider on the bottom then on top
general 2020-02-05 04:05:41 highlighting?
general 2020-02-05 04:06:13 i have built some ships that did not have pontoons
general 2020-02-05 04:06:20 bruh
general 2020-02-05 04:06:23 i dont have that
general 2020-02-05 04:06:38 my discord just updated today
general 2020-02-05 04:06:45 and it is showing no new updates
general 2020-02-05 04:07:08 k imma go to sleep now
general 2020-02-05 04:07:35 my designs are going to change
general 2020-02-05 04:07:43 i just have a boring flat slab
general 2020-02-05 04:07:55 which is basically how ships are built
general 2020-02-05 04:08:11 but yeah im going to add more curve
general 2020-02-05 04:08:37 once i figure out how to properly make a bow and what now with half blocks
general 2020-02-05 04:08:58 if it can be rammed by the Paradians then it a boat
general 2020-02-05 04:09:29 i dont see half blocks and wedges for the bow on that ship
general 2020-02-05 04:09:42 which interests me
general 2020-02-05 04:10:03 oh no i see half wedges
general 2020-02-05 04:10:24 but not many
general 2020-02-05 04:10:44 k imma commit sleep now
general 2020-02-05 04:10:53 before i repeat it like 10 more times
general 2020-02-05 04:10:56 so bye

general 2020-02-05 23:13:03 and gun will get you no where
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:16:20 i am convinced that the filter uses machine learning to find out any words that could be bad
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:16:23 to so like
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:16:58 ### ### ### ### ###### = Hi, how are you doing?
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:17:22 that is what could happen
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:17:34 but at least it beats Roblox's people skills
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:18:29 ##h
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 23:18:50 #### is not ######t
general 2020-02-06 00:49:32 first ever documented plane crazy build

general 2020-02-06 00:49:57 forget what is was called
general 2020-02-06 00:50:02 but it was custom
general 2020-02-06 00:50:09 like every one of my builds
general 2020-02-06 00:50:21 however i built a rocket ship before that one
general 2020-02-06 00:50:30 but i dont have screenshots
general 2020-02-06 00:51:06 strawberry bread
general 2020-02-06 00:51:27 
general 2020-02-06 00:51:45 so you created strawberry bread
general 2020-02-06 00:52:10 i crossed dimensions
general 2020-02-06 00:52:16 👌
general 2020-02-06 00:53:54 and i did it again
general 2020-02-06 00:56:29 dont worry
general 2020-02-06 00:56:37 i did it 3 more times
general 2020-02-06 00:57:07 <@!155149108183695360>

general 2020-02-06 00:57:16 why are all the bots dying
general 2020-02-06 01:00:04 *repeated hacking up of lungs*
general 2020-02-06 01:08:01 dyno has been revived
general 2020-02-06 01:08:40 but the voting bot died
general 2020-02-06 01:08:51 it tried to come back
general 2020-02-06 01:09:01 but it failed
general 2020-02-06 01:18:49 no
general 2020-02-06 01:18:58 i just figured out how to do it
general 2020-02-06 01:19:17 but it only works like 1% of the time
general 2020-02-06 01:19:32 well because rickje and scripting do not mix
general 2020-02-06 01:19:39 and the games script is ajgjskladfhv
general 2020-02-06 01:20:02 you could just jump over the void and deploy your parachute
general 2020-02-06 01:20:06 and wait
general 2020-02-06 01:20:10 until it explodes

general 2020-02-09 19:54:46 and he knows it
general 2020-02-09 19:54:49 if he hates the bot
general 2020-02-09 19:55:24 or maybe because it is named after a mod
general 2020-02-09 19:55:30 why is bad?
general 2020-02-09 19:55:45 so all bots are bad

general 2020-02-09 20:01:12 battleship makes up 7.6%
general 2020-02-09 20:01:40 2%
general 2020-02-09 20:02:12 i dunno why, but rick isnt logged
general 2020-02-09 20:02:33 he must not be the top 50 message senders

plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:36:35 super rockets are for speed
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:36:49 the basic rockets are more for power
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:38:11 @somebodythatcanproperlymakewarships, is this a good basic shape for a destroyer?

plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:04:24 put black blocks a block or two from the front
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:04:37 it looks more realistic and overall better
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:06:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:06:51 however usually the intakes are usually smaller then that

plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:13:44 only 8 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:13:55 you could make it slower
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 23:14:00 like maybe 1000 speed

plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:08:48 like Bofor guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:08:59 which was a clip of 4-6 rounds
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:09:19 fire rate of like 1 shot per 1 or 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:09:27 heavy shell
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:10:02 remember when the United States used their 155mm cannons as AA guns

plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:11:17 they can fly without the plane part
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:12:18 imagine hitting a tiny target, using evasive maneuvers, heading towards you at an angle at a speed of 230 km/h, with winds blowing to the left at 10 knots
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:12:43 at a range of up to 7 kilometers
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:13:13 its basically have a dance party with the gun in hopes you hit something important
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:13:42 which was like everything that you could hit by chance
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 01:13:58 bullet drop

general 2020-02-13 01:20:13 that...
general 2020-02-13 01:20:41 the games code cannot be so messed up that that would work
general 2020-02-13 01:20:58 there should no be no way that would be possible
general 2020-02-13 01:21:17 unless that was coded specifically
general 2020-02-13 01:22:23 achyon is basically a god of the game
general 2020-02-13 01:22:38 and likes to hack the game to do his math homework
general 2020-02-13 01:23:10 what is he saying
general 2020-02-13 01:23:15 about the conveyors
general 2020-02-13 01:23:29 so he would be hacking
general 2020-02-13 01:23:39 take pics of the chat
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:25:12 that thruster looks quite ugly
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:25:30 replace it with light blocks, and a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:26:54 remove all the thrusters and make it all look more like the millennium falcon
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:27:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:27:22 conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:27:54

general 2020-02-13 01:31:25 while following the Y-axis grid
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:33:00 conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:33:09 you might be able to have two conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:33:16 one for normal flight
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 01:33:20 and one for warp

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:27:35 💥
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:28:47 Coupler blocks... basically disconnecter, but can re-attach to itself, and couplers on other builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:29:51 planes that can carry carriers
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:31:10 I could build my Linvia class battleship to scale

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:36:21 yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:36:27 5.5k
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:37:12 more than all the Innovation inc games in a month
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:41:46 ships would look cooler in battle if fireworks had a lot further range
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:41:53 like bofors
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:42:00 all the boom boom in the air

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:53:26 i dont
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:53:39 but im very good at creating fake voice cracks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:53:46 that sound very real
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:55:14 scams
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:55:34 they make good bombing targets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:55:50 and artillery strike targets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:56:12 no wonder it is a bomber magnet
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:56:22 its got WWII germany all over it
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:57:04 according to War Thunder
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:57:15 Build some platform AA
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:57:16 and put it by the airport
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:57:28 and boom you have a nuclear bomb cannon
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:58:36 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:58:43 at the ranges in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:58:58 base AA in War Thunder can one shot basically anything
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:59:03 as long as it can hit it
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:59:19 otherwise it is better as causing heart attacks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:59:34 and triggering PTSD
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:59:53 they do
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:00:00 but it is hard to hit
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:00:20 and gun shells hit the ground once they leave the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:00:26 because bullet drop
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:04:29 yers
bot-central 2020-02-13 21:41:24 ?whois BigTheBuildy

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:47:18 select tool?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:48:44 what do you mean "select tool"
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:49:26 i dont understand what its use would be
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:50:04 but it would select all the blocks behind the highlighted area
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:50:40 so something like shift + lmb to select multiple blocks of your choosing
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:50:49 like studio
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:53:52 some noobs in a public sewer are roleplaying the magic school bus
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:54:15 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:54:49 but first
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:54:54 RE-WRITE
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:55:00 so the game is less laggy
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:55:16 and rick can fix bugs
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:55:21 and add more features
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:57:36 or you could just go to the wiki
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 21:57:37 like i do

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 22:43:57 132651 should be the possible
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 22:43:59 maybe less
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 22:44:04 because plot size

plane-crazy 2020-02-17 21:39:43 If you mean brain memory. Then there is no unit, because there is no memory.
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 21:39:57 Go to school for proof of that claim.

general 2020-02-19 03:03:34 where is your friendly neighborhood nerd
general 2020-02-19 03:04:13 that can figure out the temperature at which silicon turns to plasma
general 2020-02-19 03:04:32 else hyperbit gonna beat me up

general 2020-02-20 01:20:30 if they get sick, it is there fault
general 2020-02-20 01:20:46 they could not sue the school too
general 2020-02-20 01:20:50 if they decided to
general 2020-02-20 01:21:49 the school is not liable if you got sick because you did something that the school told you not to do
general 2020-02-20 01:22:01 however they are liable if the asbestos harms you
general 2020-02-20 01:24:08 what the tank for?

general 2020-02-27 02:30:36 In 'n out burger?
general 2020-02-27 02:31:59 i seem to always pass my tests
general 2020-02-27 02:32:03 and i dont study
general 2020-02-27 02:32:43 i dont play
general 2020-02-27 02:32:47 so i would not know
general 2020-02-27 02:33:27 i kind of do
general 2020-02-27 02:33:38 its a nice break from staring and listening
general 2020-02-27 02:33:40 but
general 2020-02-27 02:33:46 its painful
general 2020-02-27 02:34:02 and you have to sit and be stressed whether you will pass or not
general 2020-02-27 02:34:47 the american school system is failing very hard
general 2020-02-27 02:34:59 and now individual schools are failing
general 2020-02-27 02:35:21 I heard finland only has 5 hours of school each day
general 2020-02-27 02:35:25 no homework
general 2020-02-27 02:35:30 and much longer breaks
general 2020-02-27 02:35:48 and they are like the top 10 most educated country
general 2020-02-27 02:35:52 in the world
general 2020-02-27 02:35:58 whilst grand old united states
general 2020-02-27 02:36:07 the worlds super economy and super military
general 2020-02-27 02:36:24 has expensive schools built for the 1800s
general 2020-02-27 02:36:42 which teach us nothing on how to survive the adult life
general 2020-02-27 02:37:59 most european countries with the very successful well educated people are socialist
general 2020-02-27 02:38:23 converting the United States to socialist would break the economy
general 2020-02-27 02:38:28 and everyone within the country
general 2020-02-27 02:39:06 also most companies within the US want a college degree
general 2020-02-27 02:39:10 not your skill
general 2020-02-27 02:39:35 so you could be a world class engineer that could redesign the entire earth
general 2020-02-27 02:39:40 and nobody would care
general 2020-02-27 02:40:01 they just want that piece of paper hung on you bedroom wall
general 2020-02-27 02:40:08 I play WoWS
general 2020-02-27 02:40:13 but i cant rn
general 2020-02-27 02:40:52 also every one of us was talking about something different
general 2020-02-27 02:41:29 yeah i do not like that
general 2020-02-27 02:41:59 same
general 2020-02-27 02:42:21 wish i could do that same with KSP or Cities Skylines
general 2020-02-27 02:42:28 5 hours of loading times
general 2020-02-27 02:42:34 just to crash when done
general 2020-02-27 02:43:28 you could mod your computer
general 2020-02-27 02:43:29 maybe

general 2020-02-27 21:41:29 that is more a roblox issue
general 2020-02-27 21:41:45 but preventing server lag would help
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 21:44:35 obc
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 21:44:44 i said something like that argument today in school
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 21:45:04 only it involved me being 70% jesus because i can step on bodies

general 2020-02-27 22:14:54 you need to hack the game in order to even get blocks
general 2020-02-27 22:14:56 or cash
general 2020-02-27 22:15:00 or anything for that matter

general 2020-02-28 01:44:55 he tried claiming responsibility for taking this picture
general 2020-02-28 01:45:28 so then i took a pic of the original post
general 2020-02-28 01:45:47 go the link to the original post
general 2020-02-28 01:45:52 then for some stupid reason

general 2020-02-28 01:46:53 has he been banned twice already?
general 2020-02-28 01:48:08 he is in the airport community
general 2020-02-28 01:48:15 i dunno why
general 2020-02-28 01:48:31 but that community seems to attract many of the servers troublemakers
general 2020-02-28 01:48:41 i also do not know why
general 2020-02-28 01:49:07 probably because it has the largest numbers
general 2020-02-28 01:49:35 ~~but my server has more stuff to break~~
general 2020-02-28 01:50:07 the link is in <#617941134605549579>

general 2020-02-29 19:13:15 wdym
general 2020-02-29 19:15:05 probably
general 2020-02-29 19:15:10 or maybe it was in game
general 2020-02-29 19:15:21 hence why he will not allow in game admins
general 2020-02-29 19:52:30 you in the dev build?

general 2020-02-29 20:19:42 he might just get community contributor rank
general 2020-02-29 20:20:20 did you help create the map?
general 2020-02-29 20:20:49 or maybe rick will just create a whole new rank for those who worked on the map
general 2020-02-29 20:21:06 ask henku if he wants anything to be done
general 2020-02-29 20:21:14 so you can at least say that you helped
general 2020-02-29 20:21:22 and henku will give you credit

bug-reports 2020-02-29 21:11:08 also none of those should be able to work underwater

general 2020-03-01 00:04:16 its upsetting to see any game get hacked
general 2020-03-01 00:04:27 whether or not it is a bad game
general 2020-03-01 00:10:02 discord server link?
general 2020-03-01 00:10:12 is it in-game

general 2020-03-01 00:10:39 and the roblox group
general 2020-03-01 00:11:27 probably
general 2020-03-01 00:11:41 oh also
general 2020-03-01 00:12:15 there are people going around with VPNs, and throwaway emails sending massages to roblox
general 2020-03-01 00:12:21 and getting people banned
general 2020-03-01 00:12:37 innocent people
general 2020-03-01 00:13:02 i dont know how they did it
general 2020-03-01 00:13:37 sad that people decide to do this
general 2020-03-01 00:13:42 just for fun
general 2020-03-01 01:16:20 nah
general 2020-03-01 01:16:23 we all want that

general 2020-03-01 01:19:07 hmmm
general 2020-03-01 01:22:12 no
general 2020-03-01 01:22:20 drag is literally drag
general 2020-03-01 01:22:24 but crazy powerful
general 2020-03-01 01:23:02 no
general 2020-03-01 01:23:32 rick said that drag was how fast the hover thrusters will slow down
general 2020-03-01 01:23:48 its like an invisible parachute for each thruster
general 2020-03-01 01:23:55 that is always deployed
general 2020-03-01 01:24:52 i dunno why
general 2020-03-01 01:25:05 but no one in my server knows what russian hard bass is
general 2020-03-01 01:25:15 or they are confused why i listen to it

plane-crazy 2020-03-01 23:24:12 i have it too
general 2020-03-01 23:48:59 no
general 2020-03-02 00:58:24 im getting very irritated with school projects
general 2020-03-02 00:58:37 like posters and such
general 2020-03-02 00:58:57 anything involving creativity i dont like
general 2020-03-02 00:59:03 because im to creative for myself
general 2020-03-02 00:59:09 and i take to long
general 2020-03-02 00:59:22 and in case of a project im trying to do right now
general 2020-03-02 00:59:43 i can not figure out what to do within the requirements to save my life
general 2020-03-02 01:00:10 i have one idea that i will have fun with, yet it does not meet all the requirements
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:01:32 im concerned how you dont know what drag is
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:01:56 i knew what it was in third grade
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:04:37 either you are big unde, or you are not going to get far in life because you do not listen in school
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:05:32 i was taught it in elementary
general 2020-03-02 01:06:34 im more european then american
general 2020-03-02 01:06:52 so like when someone says football i get confused
general 2020-03-02 01:07:08 whether they are talking about american football
general 2020-03-02 01:07:11 or just football
general 2020-03-02 01:08:03 also im getting very triggered by this project for school
general 2020-03-02 01:08:10 so many requirements
general 2020-03-02 01:08:29 i cannot piece them together to form something that will actually look good
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:08:50 in grade 8 we are learning chemistry
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:00 and grade 7 we learned biology
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:09 nothing of which did anyone memorize
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:21 the US
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:10:58 i see how you could
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:10 but i dont how to make it work
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:14 i never have before
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:52 pistons are broke
general 2020-03-02 01:16:09 actually it happened in 2 minutes
general 2020-03-02 01:16:28 but that was because rickje was a derp
general 2020-03-02 01:16:40 it probably was
general 2020-03-02 01:16:52 its hard to tell
general 2020-03-02 01:17:33 funny thing is
general 2020-03-02 01:17:39 i beat rickje to the announcement
general 2020-03-02 01:17:58 by 20 minutes
general 2020-03-02 01:18:15 i announced the update in my own server before rick did
general 2020-03-02 01:19:37 and im much worse
general 2020-03-02 01:19:55 i dunno why
general 2020-03-02 01:20:07 but that made me think of war thunder
general 2020-03-02 01:20:55 how i am good in air realistic battles as long as there is no Bf 109 or Fw 190 within 20 astronomical units of my plane
general 2020-03-02 01:22:05 the armament on those planes paired with the maneuverability is way to much for even the russians
general 2020-03-02 01:22:45 no one country should have a plane with the stupid powerful 20 mil cannons
bug-reports 2020-03-02 01:25:12 performance got better
bug-reports 2020-03-02 01:25:19 until someone brings out the large build
bug-reports 2020-03-02 01:25:24 then its get really bad
general 2020-03-02 01:25:58 the only reason i dont die to german aircraft so much
general 2020-03-02 01:26:36 is because i can see the scary silhouette of the planes
general 2020-03-02 01:28:48 if you have not played war thunder in any allied aircraft
general 2020-03-02 01:28:52 you will not understand
bot-central 2020-03-02 01:30:44 ?whois
bot-central 2020-03-02 01:30:57 if people keep leaving
bot-central 2020-03-02 01:31:28 i could get the OG member rank
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:32:08 how
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:32:17 do you not go flying out of control
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:32:43 i literally cannot go more than 2000 without teleporting into 5 dimensions at once
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:33 Noc did you use a hover drive?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:43 what how
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:34:17 the one i use lost any control after the new update

general 2020-03-07 16:46:24 oh yay figured it out
general 2020-03-07 17:43:57 you being annoyed, or the person being the noob?
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 17:47:28 its like people who join the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 17:47:32 skip the tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 17:47:50 and then ask for someone for help
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 17:48:14 super annoying
general 2020-03-07 17:51:46 what are they trying to test on their planes though?
general 2020-03-07 17:57:10 you could do that in a normal server <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
general 2020-03-07 18:19:08 WoWs
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:54:43 rick
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:54:58 you should really start trying to get madattak to work on the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:55:18 he works on innovation inc all the time
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:55:33 and he could be in school
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:55:40 but he should work on the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:55:49 its his game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:55:56 he needs to work on it
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:56:08 especially since it keeps growing
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:56:36 its bigger then the entire group
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:57:33 also a lot of innovation inc games are being built by other members
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:57:42 such as the spaceship and thermal power plant
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:58:18 also rick is likely very rich from premium payouts
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:59:11 plane crazy also has infinite potential
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:02:28 i wish there was a sight that showed how much robux a player has
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:02:38 rbxrocks does something like that
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:02:42 but only for trading
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:02:54 so i could see how much rickje is getting from plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:06:11 plane crazy has more visits than innovation inc arctic base
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:06:19 but less then innovation labs
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:11:11 also a lot of the stuff rickje cannot do
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:11:15 mad can do
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:11:53 who uses waterwheels though
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:18:18 he certainly earns more then innovation inc
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:18:54 premium payouts...
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:19:52 the game brings in robux from premium subscribers staying in the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:20:02 the longer premium members stay
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:20:06 the more he earns
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:20:29 and there are quite a few premium members that stay for hours at a time
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:25:30 it goes to madattak noobs
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:25:32 he owns the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:26:44 rick needs to say that
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:26:51 i want to ping and ask
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:26:59 but i dont want the ban hammer
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:28:57 roblox blocks anything found in any dictionary for any language
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 19:29:09 whether or not if there is even a dictionary

general 2020-03-10 01:24:06 that exhaust tho
general 2020-03-10 01:24:33 environmentalists gonna declare war on you with their solar powered tanks
general 2020-03-10 01:25:50 invincible armor
general 2020-03-10 01:26:04 that also has a fool proof way to prevent getting captured
general 2020-03-10 01:26:12 i dunno
general 2020-03-10 01:27:38 nooo
general 2020-03-10 01:27:55 i just found out one of my friends had an oblivion on Galaxy
general 2020-03-10 01:27:57 and lost it
general 2020-03-10 01:28:21 they even posted about it in the Galaxy server
general 2020-03-10 01:33:11 super capital <@!498337842347507713>
general 2020-03-10 01:33:31 so basically a freakishly expensive boat with scary big guns
general 2020-03-10 01:37:19 how to suggestions
general 2020-03-10 01:40:38 also the last time i played with my friend he had a score 3000 points less then me
general 2020-03-10 01:40:41 at like 1000
general 2020-03-10 01:40:49 now i went up like 1000 points
general 2020-03-10 01:40:58 while he went up 250000 points
general 2020-03-10 01:41:02 so now im jealous
general 2020-03-10 01:41:15 i must start playing the game again
general 2020-03-10 01:42:15 i have become the noob
general 2020-03-10 01:42:23 although i noticed that 3 months ago
general 2020-03-10 20:35:19 i found a big bruh moment in my town
general 2020-03-10 20:36:12 so our local electricity provider decided to repaint an entire van advertising the company, and how they like green energy
general 2020-03-10 20:36:27 and they claimed the car was 100% electric
general 2020-03-10 20:36:30 so
general 2020-03-10 20:36:42 they decided to put a combustion engine in it
general 2020-03-10 20:36:55 i would have taken a picture if i had a phone
general 2020-03-10 20:37:33 but a 100% electric car running on 10% ethanol unleaded fuel
general 2020-03-10 20:38:49 also i figured out the war funder wiki had all the pros and cons of the P-51 correct
general 2020-03-10 20:38:56 so im gonna start using it
general 2020-03-10 20:39:12 so the P-51 is not the only plane i can fly
general 2020-03-10 20:57:04 i had to kill a BV 238
general 2020-03-10 20:57:08 but i had no ammo
general 2020-03-10 20:57:26 so i tried to gently fly over him, destroying his props in the process
general 2020-03-10 20:57:31 but he moved
general 2020-03-10 20:57:36 ye
general 2020-03-10 20:57:45 and i got deaded
general 2020-03-10 21:58:56 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-03-10 22:10:57 i literally just had 10 enemy fighters swarm me
general 2020-03-10 22:11:10 i did die
general 2020-03-10 22:11:30 and for some reason none of them got hit by the shear amount of base AA
general 2020-03-10 22:11:38 and SPAA
general 2020-03-10 22:13:20 honestly i think it **may** be true based on statistics
general 2020-03-10 22:13:28 but im not sure at all
general 2020-03-10 22:20:24 Okay according to iihs.org using data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, there are more male driven crashes then female. However that gap is going down. There are more female driven in car crashes per every male driven car crashes, then in 1975. And that ratio is only getting smaller. <@!221487880487436288>
general 2020-03-10 22:20:47 So you were wrong
general 2020-03-11 00:06:18 somebody say B-17???
general 2020-03-11 00:06:38 
general 2020-03-11 00:06:47 i play minecraft alone a lot
general 2020-03-11 00:06:54 kinda fun
general 2020-03-11 00:07:15 i have problems of my own
general 2020-03-11 00:07:30 i would also like to add my problems
general 2020-03-11 00:07:43 4. why
5. why
6. you okay?
general 2020-03-11 00:42:07 Java edition le best
general 2020-03-11 00:42:23 the only issue is
general 2020-03-11 00:42:32 i cannot spell cauldron
general 2020-03-11 00:42:43 and i use that block quite a bit
general 2020-03-11 00:42:59 and i can never find it without searching for it
general 2020-03-11 00:43:32 spellcheck
general 2020-03-11 00:44:01 also i was needing that block so i was able to spell it correctly
general 2020-03-11 00:44:08 its a curse on my family
general 2020-03-11 00:44:28 we can never find or do anything when we need it
general 2020-03-11 00:44:41 especially with scissors
general 2020-03-11 00:45:02 we always need scissors but we can never find them until we do not need them
general 2020-03-11 00:47:08 but you need to pay attention to the road
general 2020-03-11 00:47:12 so you will not be fired
general 2020-03-11 00:47:19 or be on fire
general 2020-03-11 00:48:33 i wonder if someone hooked up his vehicle to a keyboard
general 2020-03-11 00:48:37 and drove the car that way
general 2020-03-11 00:48:41 wasd keys
general 2020-03-11 00:49:55 i might be screwing up a project worth 3 tests
general 2020-03-11 00:50:08 and i do not know how to make it better then it is now
general 2020-03-11 00:50:16 im also screwing up my brain
general 2020-03-11 00:51:01 so
general 2020-03-11 00:51:06 kinda complicated
general 2020-03-11 00:51:39 but for ELA our teacher decided to make us read various books based on WWII
general 2020-03-11 00:51:48 and after painful reading with a partner
general 2020-03-11 00:51:54 we could split up
general 2020-03-11 00:52:18 join different groups that read the same book, or go by ourselves
general 2020-03-11 00:52:25 to do one of 8 project choices
general 2020-03-11 00:52:42 i choose a board game because i can commit creativity, and do it alone
general 2020-03-11 00:52:47 but im like
general 2020-03-11 00:52:58 no
general 2020-03-11 00:53:06 not based historically
general 2020-03-11 00:53:22 these were all historical fiction books
general 2020-03-11 00:53:33 and the projects need to be based off the books
general 2020-03-11 00:53:47 which our teacher read each one five times
general 2020-03-11 00:53:57 i have a good start
general 2020-03-11 00:54:10 but im butchering one of the criteria
general 2020-03-11 00:54:23 and im a lazy try hard with homework
general 2020-03-11 00:54:26 so it bothers me
general 2020-03-11 00:54:36 basically
general 2020-03-11 00:54:55 just need to try hard enough to get extra credit on other aspects
general 2020-03-11 00:55:12 since the project is worth a test grade
general 2020-03-11 00:55:15 and the only test grade
general 2020-03-11 00:56:11 it might work if its relevant to the work
general 2020-03-11 00:57:31 oh any my social studies teacher decided to make us roleplay a little bit as the crew of a B-17
general 2020-03-11 00:58:24 if you lived with no injuries, you had no assignment, if you were injured, you need to write a letter, if you survived a crash but were captured the le germans, you had to write a telegram
general 2020-03-11 00:58:36 if you died
general 2020-03-11 00:58:44 you need to write an obituary
general 2020-03-11 00:59:46 what happened to me was a german fighter smashed the tail cutting right through
general 2020-03-11 00:59:57 and being the tail gunner
general 2020-03-11 01:00:00 i got out
general 2020-03-11 01:00:22 seems so
general 2020-03-11 01:00:48 i had a parachute
general 2020-03-11 01:00:51 and a body
general 2020-03-11 01:01:15 the waist gunners straight up exploded like coke and mentos
general 2020-03-11 01:01:24 fun to watch
general 2020-03-11 01:01:41 oh and the bombardier on my plane somehow got out
general 2020-03-11 01:01:50 everyone else died
general 2020-03-11 01:02:35 oh we just watched a movie based on what we were doing
general 2020-03-11 01:02:48 but there was some roleplaying
general 2020-03-11 01:02:57 and we all had to create a persona
general 2020-03-11 01:03:02 and for my plane
general 2020-03-11 01:03:14 since the fate of the waist gunners was only shown
general 2020-03-11 01:03:30 the holy potato chip can had to decide the rest of our fates
general 2020-03-11 01:04:10 voxel i just want to point out
general 2020-03-11 01:04:18 your folder color is the same of my folder color
general 2020-03-11 01:04:22 for plane crazy servers
general 2020-03-11 01:04:40 oh and uuh
general 2020-03-11 01:04:46 a bomber exploded
general 2020-03-11 01:04:56 and the one next to us got a free red paint job
general 2020-03-11 01:05:04 from the explosion
general 2020-03-11 01:05:38 nah we were above germany
general 2020-03-11 01:05:52 yeah
general 2020-03-11 01:05:56 i was captured
general 2020-03-11 01:06:05 so i need to make a realistic telegram
general 2020-03-11 01:06:33 oh and everyone except those who survived without injury need to post the different assignments on our lockers
general 2020-03-11 01:08:43 join what?
general 2020-03-11 01:09:42 yeah like that

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:53:15 he could make his own black hole
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:54:46 my internet died again
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:54:48 but yeah

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:56:37 i have 6 robux
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:03 why?
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:16 or you could just make a space game mode
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:21 with no gravity
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:50 but why dont you just make a separate gamemode
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:54 that is dark
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:57:57 and has no map
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:58:04 just a measly platform to build on
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:58:08 looks more natural
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:58:21 also sounds easier to make
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:58:31 instead of having to code local gravity
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:03 seperate gamemode for public sewers
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:15 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:16 okay
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:21 tanks yous rickjes
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:36 name change?
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:41 it wouldnt
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:47 wait
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 20:59:48 rick
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:00:16 but low gravity does not cause you to go up
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:00:21 something else needs to
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:00:27 like you jumping
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:01:16 you win bragging rights
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:01:30 also expert ranks
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 21:02:41 i have many alt accounts

general 2020-03-12 21:41:23 then it is likely you do not have the best skill
general 2020-03-12 21:41:39 but some people do downvote just to downvote
general 2020-03-12 22:14:52 why is my computer giving me troubles now
general 2020-03-12 22:15:04 it cannot save worlds on minecraft
general 2020-03-12 22:15:24 it keeps randomly crashing
general 2020-03-12 22:17:43 KSP randomly crashes
general 2020-03-12 22:18:17 roblox gets high ping rates for like 10 minutes making everything unplayable occasionally
general 2020-03-12 22:18:29 or the internet connection just straight up snaps
general 2020-03-12 22:18:49 its irritating me
general 2020-03-12 22:26:59 rewrite when?
general 2020-03-12 22:27:21 it means the code sucks
general 2020-03-12 22:27:33 most things that could be added
general 2020-03-12 22:27:39 need a rewrite first
general 2020-03-12 22:28:13 he really should
general 2020-03-12 22:28:24 so he caused an issue
general 2020-03-12 22:29:19 working on innovation inc
general 2020-03-12 22:29:28 if its college
general 2020-03-12 22:29:37 that he should focus on
general 2020-03-12 22:30:13 maybe rick, you could play around on your own
general 2020-03-12 22:30:28 and see if you can figure out a way to rewrite the game
general 2020-03-12 22:30:37 and make it easier to update
general 2020-03-12 22:31:01 make the code simple and easy to change
general 2020-03-12 22:31:09 and implement new stuff
general 2020-03-12 23:14:36 my computer crashed again
general 2020-03-12 23:14:42 everytime i play war thunder
general 2020-03-12 23:14:44 it crashes
general 2020-03-12 23:14:48 and has to restart
general 2020-03-12 23:20:34 also im raging because im having biplanes catch up to me while im flying at 550 km/h
general 2020-03-12 23:20:46 and then tearing off everything that can be torn off
general 2020-03-12 23:20:51 in war thunder
general 2020-03-12 23:21:10 stupid
general 2020-03-12 23:21:35 and meanwhile im flying the planes as intended
general 2020-03-12 23:21:41 and picking my fights
general 2020-03-12 23:21:58 fights that i would otherwise have an advantage
general 2020-03-12 23:22:36 and i always seem to be destroyed
general 2020-03-12 23:23:10 and if i am not destroyed, then my entire team is and only one or two down planes on the enemy's side
general 2020-03-12 23:23:23 so they all come for me
general 2020-03-12 23:24:13 and all the stupid players get all the cash and junk
general 2020-03-12 23:24:17 so annoying
general 2020-03-12 23:24:50 the game is fun overall
general 2020-03-12 23:25:09 and i am a trial and error type of person
general 2020-03-12 23:25:26 and so i like to find my issues, what i do wrong, and then try to correct it
general 2020-03-12 23:25:35 yeah it does
general 2020-03-12 23:26:12 but back to my issues that not one person cares about

general 2020-03-14 18:14:27 it is very annoying and it makes it harder to get staff when actually needed
general 2020-03-14 18:14:41 it is literally like a prank 911 call
general 2020-03-14 18:20:51 <#519624169730605086>

plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:22:46 mad could just disable his ping notifications for the channel
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:24:34 he will when he has 2000 pings
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:24:57 but will you disable mass pings for the channel first?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:25:10 so we can like @ping+E^100
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:25:30 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:27:02 or maybe every 100 times "madattak" is said
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:27:11 he will get one ping
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:27:32 but paragraphs do not count
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:27:59 only one individual madattak
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 00:28:23 Rick the je Johnson

plane-crazy 2020-03-15 01:21:09 except the way the wings are made
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 01:21:17 but the scaling and the coloring i like
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 01:25:06 the landing gear though

general 2020-03-20 21:49:21 that mountain is easily recognizable
general 2020-03-20 21:49:25 Pikes Peak
general 2020-03-20 21:50:42 Trump went to Colorado Springs recently
general 2020-03-20 21:51:32 what for though
general 2020-03-20 21:51:57 the Boeing 747?
general 2020-03-20 21:52:38 the terrain looks real

general 2020-03-20 21:54:31 basically anything can run war thunder
general 2020-03-20 21:54:40 from what i have heard

general 2020-03-20 22:09:45 then everything that can burn, burns
general 2020-03-20 22:09:54 including stuff that should not burn

general 2020-03-20 22:21:54 8 different subsections
general 2020-03-20 22:22:35 and our school apparently has a pandemic plan too
general 2020-03-20 22:22:45 although for the flu, not the coronavirus
general 2020-03-20 22:23:09 yeah
general 2020-03-20 22:23:22 no
general 2020-03-20 22:23:40 because you cannot afford to buy toilet paper
general 2020-03-20 22:23:48 if the flu becomes an issue
general 2020-03-20 22:23:59 with the coronavirus however, since there is no cure
general 2020-03-20 22:24:10 you cant get medicine for it
general 2020-03-20 22:24:30 so if you get severely sick
general 2020-03-20 22:24:43 the doctors cant prescribe a medicine that eats at your wallet
general 2020-03-20 22:25:00 so you have money for toilet paper
general 2020-03-20 22:25:38 what if someone hurts you
general 2020-03-20 22:25:50 you never know when you might get run over

plane-crazy 2020-03-21 20:06:57 no one should complain
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 20:07:10 or when the ones with supercomputers start lagging

general 2020-03-23 11:23:42 my mom knows what discord is
general 2020-03-23 11:23:45 i think
general 2020-03-23 11:23:54 she knows the idea and all the features
general 2020-03-23 11:24:36 cause i told her <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
general 2020-03-23 11:24:55 no idea if she understood
general 2020-03-23 11:25:18 but yeah i dont think that server is going in
general 2020-03-23 11:25:41 with harassment and toxicity
general 2020-03-23 11:26:59 nice
general 2020-03-23 11:27:10 i set up my server mostly by myself
general 2020-03-23 11:27:48 though Voxel helped set up the verification system
general 2020-03-23 11:27:58 since there was no guide for the bot anywhere
general 2020-03-23 11:28:37 i used rover
general 2020-03-23 11:28:54 because it gets the job done most the time
general 2020-03-23 11:29:56 <@!546223347025969164> what is his server's name though?
general 2020-03-23 11:35:28 no server name
bot-central 2020-03-23 11:35:47 ?whois NewMagicFire5
bot-central 2020-03-23 11:36:05 ?whois DinDanDio
general 2020-03-23 11:43:05 ye
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:43:07 it is for me but i can only play on a kindle
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:10 it might have higher friction properties
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:21 since i assume the materials have the default
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:53 the friction block might have been maxed out on friction properties
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:57:09 no
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:58:58 Tie fighters are very commonly built

general 2020-03-24 21:49:49 and now im getting frustrated

general 2020-03-25 22:01:01 <@!105723378949718016> stealth belts have no tracers, so a pilot does not know they are being shot at until then get hit
general 2020-03-25 22:01:18 this often causes them to panic and thus they often make irrational decisions

general 2020-03-28 23:21:33 yall wrong
general 2020-03-28 23:22:01 Universe Sandbox ~~2~~
general 2020-03-28 23:22:22 when you land the BV 238 on water
general 2020-03-28 23:22:32 do you get repaired and such
general 2020-03-28 23:23:22 the 238 is an easy target to hit but you have to get past the defensive gunners first
general 2020-03-28 23:23:51 i remember finding one 238 whos pilot was controlling to guns
general 2020-03-28 23:24:00 they made no attempt to kill me
general 2020-03-28 23:24:31 i caused a fire in their left wing but did not trust that it would kill him
general 2020-03-28 23:25:06 so me and ammo'nt decided it would be a good idea to maneuver over his other wing and try and take out his engine
general 2020-03-28 23:25:24 he figured out what i was doing and slapped me for it
general 2020-03-28 23:25:33 then his left wing exploded
general 2020-03-28 23:26:06 why did you leave?
general 2020-03-28 23:26:32 you could have just reverified
general 2020-03-29 04:23:31 *laughs in never restarting*
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:24:13 Platoon
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:41:55 ropes can be used for decoration
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:52:30 much detail
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:52:36 many curves
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:56:35 you should only post finished builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:56:56 flak
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:57:09 just increase fireworks range
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:57:49 also timed reload on rockets
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:59:09 you still lack detail
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:59:11 color
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:59:14 wooden deck
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:59:23 life boats
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 04:59:33 smoke stacks
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:00:37 you could also add your own details
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:01:04 6 limit
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:01:17 6 block limit
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:01:30 imagine if guns and rockets used ammo
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:01:48 that would help fix the spamming issue
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:02:07 and you would have to worry less about stuff being OP
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:02:18 and if the ammo exploded
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:03:31 i dont want new weapons i just want better physics and longer fireworks range
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 05:03:48 do you

general 2020-03-29 06:32:19 but that is the price to pay to make your city look not low poly
general 2020-03-29 06:32:28 in a game that is supposed to be realistic
general 2020-03-29 06:33:10 Minecraft is the most realistic game to come out of Fiskolandia
general 2020-03-29 06:33:36 do you even know what Fiskolandia is?
general 2020-03-29 06:34:33 Fiskolandia is the collection of countries known as Norway, Sweden, and Finland
general 2020-03-29 06:35:11 not to be confused with Scandinavia which is Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark
general 2020-03-29 06:38:26 meanwhile

plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:16:51 if we had more boosts to the server that could be the server banner
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:17:19 but we need 9 more boosts
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:33:34 i liked it better alone
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:33:48 without the logo
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:34:44 also that isnt yours so i do not know why you are changing it
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:35:24 it would be nice as the server banner
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:35:41 but people will not <:BUYNITRO1:587693351860437192>
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:35:59 unless they are poor and cannot afford nitro
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:37:35 boost the server?
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:38:17 no this is about plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 19:38:22 boosting the server
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 03:53:30 an AA gun
bot-central 2020-03-30 03:56:14 !rank

general 2020-04-01 07:46:04 pyramid gods took control and enslaved a portion of the population
general 2020-04-01 07:46:26 the motor gods supported the rest and we set up a resistance
general 2020-04-01 07:47:02 in retaliation the pyramids tried to mess up everyone by flipping the text upside to make things difficult
general 2020-04-01 07:47:16 except my neck is un-naturally flexible
general 2020-04-01 07:47:51 meanwhile fonkl is abusing power to try and stop us

plane-crazy 2020-04-01 16:01:50 i just accidentally converted an entire server to the motor religion
plane-crazy 2020-04-01 16:07:10 the pyramids are on timeout

plane-crazy 2020-04-02 05:22:10 This server was taken over by the pyramids
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 05:22:37 and my server was taken over by the motors
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 05:23:07 Henkku was just propaganda

general 2020-04-04 22:55:49 having flak jackets would be cool

general 2020-04-05 07:12:21 but that was due to heavy wind and ice

general 2020-04-06 05:14:35 especially this year
general 2020-04-06 05:14:49 we almost never saw negative temps
general 2020-04-06 05:15:22 2018-2019 we only had maybe one spell of negatives

plane-crazy 2020-04-06 17:49:45 but rick grounded you so you cannot use
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 17:55:50 how to suggest
bot-central 2020-04-06 17:56:00 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-04-06 17:56:09 <@!549538911089721345>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:01:58 <@!416215683089563649> that is a thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:02:55 
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:07:52 detailed color palette?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:08:15 no need
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:08:29 sketchbook free?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:10:06 just use the color code
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:10:19 it isnt hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:11:28 or put in your own
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:12:06 im not an artist either
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:12:10 and it is not hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:12:48 and?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:13:23 just put in numbers for the colors
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:13:27 RGB
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:13:37 is
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:13:38 not
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:13:40 hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:14:22 plane crazy is not an app
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:14:35 and not necessarily
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:14:55 updating an app is to generally make it better
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:15:03 add features
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:15:12 fix issues
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:15:22 make it prettier
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:18:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:18:25 so rick should focus on other things
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:19:25 so something that would kill the player count?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:19:27 okay
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:19:53 go to <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:20:01 and you shall see that there is no issue
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:20:32 a lot of the colors you will see are not those on the color palette
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:21:05 then why do you want a color wheel?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:21:27 it would literally make no difference in the game play <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:22:46 then one does not need a color wheel
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:23:05 you can more exact colors used the freaking RGB color codes
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:23:18 it legit does not matter at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:25:54 you are literally the only person who wants this in-game though
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:27:40 you just disregarded the color code
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:28:07 well then you are brain dead
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:28:32 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:28:39 but i call it color code for simplicity
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:29:46 RGB/Color Code is much more precise then a color wheel
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:30:05 it is what literally every person with an expert rank uses
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:30:29 i dont know computer
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:31:11 if anything just add Roblox Studio's color palette
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:32:43 if you had bad screen then neither would a color wheel
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:32:53 if you have bad screen you are going to loose
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:34:17 <@!416215683089563649> you need to be ranked first
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:38:09 airport

plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:06:31 <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081>

plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:12:20 they want the views
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:12:33 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:12:41 you cannot knock the egg off
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:13:03 no you cannot
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:13:20 it just flies over you and goes back to the pedestal
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:14:02 there should be none
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:14:06 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:14:33 the game should restart when the egg hunt goes live
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:18:20 :}
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:19:10 no that might be intentional
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:19:20 nothing moved when i stepped on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:20:19 i caught the egg by sumo slamming it
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:24:25 why were you banned?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 19:24:39 i bet NSFW or toxicity

plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:06:00 no one carees about pinging
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:06:09 motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:07:35 if motor 2 wont work then i just have to use a regular motor to move that turret to look forward
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:07:42 and keep the others welded in place
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:09:04 madattak legit needs to work on his stupid game and stop taking credit for something he does not care enough about to help someone out
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:09:31 i know
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:09:44 why the ping
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:10:00 what was the point of the ping?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:10:14 <@!437078588701933568>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:11:25 legit the only way to get madattak to work on plane crazy is to just spam every way to contact him
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:11:40 DM, PM, twitter, mass ping, raid his games
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:12:13 how do we overthrow something that is not there
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:12:31 that would get you banned
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:13:05 if we ban mad from roblox then either plane crazy would be deleted
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:13:08 or no more updates
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:13:31 that will make it worse
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:13:45 because then he will not see what his largest community wants
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:14:15 to get him to work on his game
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:14:52 nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:15:14 then get some
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:15:24 go to a hospital faking the coronavirus
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:15:34 and once you are there ask for mental help
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:15:57 madattak needs social help <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:16:50 madattak ded
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:16:54 rick kil
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:17:31 madattak could also get another dev to help rick
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:17:57 but he has trust issues after an admin basically banned every single person that join all his innovation games
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:18:45 mad barely trusts anyone
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:20:23 bruh to bad the mods spy on us and also rule 4 because we could jsut spam ping mad until he makes a blood oath to help rick work on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:22:08 honestly i do not know why
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:22:13 i just want him to help rick out
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:26:07 the most we can do to get mad to help is just straight up ping him until he helps
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:26:17 we can only bring his attention here
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:28:13 <@!593884042605101086> you might want to ping rick about that
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:28:22 if builds are not spawning in correctly
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:29:47 i dont the mods noticed

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 03:32:16 i like how the first five videos in <#537387160261885962> are finding the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 03:33:12 such a view grab when it is blatantly obvious of the location

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 03:37:31 repurposed and moved away from the mainland
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 03:37:40 set at a high elevation
general 2020-04-07 03:38:46 but i dont like how they put that arrow in the thumbnail
general 2020-04-07 03:39:03 contrary to popular beliefs
general 2020-04-07 03:39:09 most people see the obvious
general 2020-04-07 03:39:23 the sub is not in the fridge door
general 2020-04-07 03:39:29 so people are going to see it
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 04:17:45 this is why you do not fly into the island props

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:31:34 maybe the island can be added to henkku's map
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:31:40 if it does get added

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:33:24 and when i do it is only to flex
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:38:44 that is a visual glitch

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:47:11 i have no rocket cause i do not care about russian pancake
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:48:13 no because you need tier 2 and up to get the materials needed
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:48:30 arcade poo poo
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:49:37 I like the greater challenge of realistic
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:50:20 i like how when i get killed it usually because i get jumped by half the team or i do something stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:50:38 especially in air arcade
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:50:56 air arcade i do not like
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:50:59 like at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:51:27 also <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:52:16 i dont do much tank battles
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:52:19 i really suck
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:52:40 i like air battles
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:53:03 many more ways to die
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:53:54 also a lot more fun then driving a tracked go kart and shooting other tracked go karts
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:59:35 Things you have to worry about in air realistic: Air speed, fuel, ammo, engine/water temp (if water cooled), oil temp, flaps destruction speed, landing gear destruction speed, structural destruction speed, optimal engine performance altitude, optimal control surfaces performance speed, drag, aircraft weight, ordinance weight, vertical energy retention, horizontal energy retention, weaponry, aerobatic maneuvers, aircraft tactics, and if you want, propeller pitch, fuel mixture, oil radiator, and general radiator
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 06:59:51 also you need to know where everyone on your team is, and the enemy team
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 07:00:20 turn your engine volume down in the settings but keep other engine volumes up so you can hear other aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 07:00:24 also

general 2020-04-07 21:11:44 my brother came out of our room and scared me
general 2020-04-07 21:11:53 and i hit the front window
general 2020-04-07 21:12:10 i was big hurt there for a week
general 2020-04-07 21:24:13 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:19:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:19:45 the summer map is the summer map
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:19:56 the summer map is the winter map but without the snow
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:20:05 the grass becomes green
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:20:11 and there is no ice on the water
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:22:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:22:35 there was ice
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:22:51 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:23:26 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:23:42 how do you buy the winter map?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:23:59 ???
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:24:07 you talking about the gamepass?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:24:17 the gamepass gives you the items
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:24:25 from the winter event
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:25:08 what
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:25:13 that is not a thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:25:35 you could be referring to the lava spitter
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:25:53 but the only thing that pushes stuff away is a magnet
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:26:03 but that only works with blocks on your own build
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:28:33 the lava lakes were part of the summer event
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:28:45 however there is still one lake by the spawn mountains
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:46:06 ee lag spike
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:46:09 i froze
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:11:46 it is a gamepass
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:11:57 it was originally supposed to be a gamepass
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:12:06 the fact that it was available was a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:12:17 but you can still use it in vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:01:31 the youtuber part is most youtubers

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:13:54 you can become tall or short
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:13:59 or flat
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:14:57 factitious opinion
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:15:33 in my opinion a robloxian is 0.125 kilometers short
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:16:39 vip i have not players wows for 6 months now
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:17:24 where did he get a foot though?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:17:33 couldnt you just literally say 6 feet?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:17:47 for simplicity
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:18:12 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:18:31 i stopped playing wows because update time
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:18:33 3 entire days

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:18:50 ptsd triggering
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:18:58 about 3 gigabytes
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:19:09 compared to 17 gigabytes from wt
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:19:16 which takes an hour on average
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:19:56 it always sucks when dealing with wargaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:21:03 also i have no interest in tank combat
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:21:57 i dont even participate in war thunder events
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:22:05 so it does not make a difference either way
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:22:26 also <#497142796961054721>
general 2020-04-08 04:28:09 i think my brother hacked that game
general 2020-04-08 04:28:16 on a tablet
general 2020-04-08 04:29:12 he played one day, and the next day he was conquering Asia
general 2020-04-08 04:30:08 unfortunately?
general 2020-04-08 04:30:43 we cant allow underaged users here because of the discord ToS
general 2020-04-08 04:31:34 hyper that person is in vc
general 2020-04-08 04:31:49 so you could hop in and do your thing
general 2020-04-08 04:31:59 if you have a mic
general 2020-04-08 04:32:51 bot is down <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
general 2020-04-08 04:33:08 MEE6 is the only option i guess
bot-central 2020-04-08 04:34:21 =p generic elevator music
bot-central 2020-04-08 04:36:28 =p one hour of boring elevator music
general 2020-04-08 04:50:46 no roblox is not down
bot-central 2020-04-08 05:05:33 ?whois NASAMS 2
bot-central 2020-04-08 05:05:45 garmd

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:08:44 also that go in <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-04-08 05:16:52 low graphics moment
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:17:43 i need to know how some people will compress the guns on their ships
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:18:06 like build the gun above the barbette and use like suspension to lower it
general 2020-04-08 05:19:39 why do you want ships?
general 2020-04-08 05:19:59 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-04-08 05:20:19 normal
general 2020-04-08 05:20:40 but i have a question in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:22:38 also suspension is broken
general 2020-04-08 05:24:40 why would you want to create a bootleg version of plane crazy if you could not make it better?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:31:06 yeah now the entire turret will not move
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:31:24 oh wait no i had the section of the ship anchored
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:34:37 now i run into the issue where the turret house gets jammed
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:34:51 because the motors pulling too hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:36:57 bottom motor is motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:37:14 im messing with ways to place the motors seeing if any will help
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:43:15 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:44:48 the weird roblox physics you were talking about is friction btw
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:47:05 yeah separating the blocks is a no-go
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:47:23 i would need a precise separation to make it look good
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:47:50 using locked motors would leave a large gap
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:49:11 i cant with the barbette design
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:51:46 having a 6x6 cylinder would be useful for the barbette though
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:52:14 having a perfect circle instead of what i am limited to with wedges
general 2020-04-08 05:54:43 if it is like a meme or a joke
general 2020-04-08 05:54:57 you post it in <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-04-08 05:55:09 if it like advertising
general 2020-04-08 05:55:33 if you are advertising then you cannot
general 2020-04-08 05:55:48 until you get the community contributer role
general 2020-04-08 05:56:06 then you can post in <#537387160261885962>
general 2020-04-08 05:56:23 10,000 views or i think 100 subs

general 2020-04-08 05:57:12 and at least 2 posted in the last month
general 2020-04-08 05:58:34 no no no
general 2020-04-08 05:58:55 you do not need discord to get views
general 2020-04-08 05:59:51 i guess you could dm someone who might need help with a video you made that explains it
general 2020-04-08 06:00:08 but dont be dm'ing randomly
general 2020-04-08 06:00:34 after you meet the requirements you just contact a mod or admin
general 2020-04-08 06:00:47 either by pinging them or dm's
general 2020-04-08 06:01:51 no not for talking to a higher level
general 2020-04-08 06:02:01 just do not ping or dm to be funny
general 2020-04-08 06:02:51 he just did
general 2020-04-08 06:03:29 I think Jail is good at responding if he is summoned
general 2020-04-08 06:04:01 well for now you have to sit back and wait
general 2020-04-08 06:04:24 but having a good title, thumbnail, and desc helps generally
general 2020-04-08 06:04:41 oh we disrespect our staff a lot

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 21:49:08 if you have enough of them spread out evenly
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 21:49:48 <@!195253906333368320> we have unde
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 21:52:28 no they have to be facing down
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 21:52:36 to hover
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 21:52:45 but they will interact with anything regardless
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 22:00:33 it means the explosives will not explode you
general 2020-04-08 22:03:10 Let's Go!
general 2020-04-08 22:03:13 that is the title
the-dump 2020-04-08 22:11:10 war thunder servers are breaking
the-dump 2020-04-08 22:11:13 too much load
the-dump 2020-04-08 22:12:20 i think i could trust that armor
the-dump 2020-04-08 22:12:34 if there is nothing equal to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 22:14:28 turn down graphic quality
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 22:48:01 yes but did they know he was a dev
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 22:48:51 rick left?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 22:51:20 bruh for some reason war thunder recognizes a button on my mouse as left control
general 2020-04-08 23:03:02 why is it half of the new members here either spam memes in general text channels
general 2020-04-08 23:03:14 or ask how to play the game
general 2020-04-08 23:03:45 yeah some members ask how certain things work like motor 2 or servo
general 2020-04-08 23:04:08 but most either do something stupid or ask something stupid
general 2020-04-08 23:05:42 virus filled downloadable <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
general 2020-04-08 23:06:11 not really whitelist
general 2020-04-08 23:06:18 that does not happen often
general 2020-04-08 23:06:31 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-04-08 23:06:36 but i will take it
general 2020-04-08 23:06:57 i like bunners except for obc cause chonk
general 2020-04-08 23:07:16 dyno dead
general 2020-04-08 23:07:33 so is member count
general 2020-04-08 23:07:59 Rover was down for quite a bit today
general 2020-04-08 23:08:35 though that only effects my server because im the only server that actually has a functional rover
general 2020-04-08 23:08:48 and the PCNG
general 2020-04-08 23:09:25 PCAA and the PCNG are the only community servers with a functioning verification system that i know of
general 2020-04-08 23:09:56 oh and small stuff gang
general 2020-04-08 23:10:21 my mom used to raise harlequin rabbits in North Dakota
general 2020-04-08 23:10:28 we had like
general 2020-04-08 23:10:33 30 or so rabbits
general 2020-04-08 23:10:42 but then we moved
general 2020-04-08 23:10:54 and could not afford to get rabbits
general 2020-04-08 23:11:09 also our town treats rabbits as livestock
general 2020-04-08 23:11:14 so we can not have them
general 2020-04-08 23:11:52 having a pet rabbit is the equivalent of owning a cow in your backyard
general 2020-04-08 23:11:56 in my town
general 2020-04-08 23:12:40 i had like 30 before noobs
general 2020-04-08 23:12:58 i had 30 rabbits never before seen in the state of North Dakota
general 2020-04-08 23:13:00 so ye
general 2020-04-08 23:13:20 rare kind to
general 2020-04-08 23:14:42 this is what my mom raised

general 2020-04-08 23:18:55 rabbits are edible though
general 2020-04-08 23:19:21 during WWI the American Government tried to get people to hunt rabbits so the soldiers could have food
general 2020-04-08 23:19:40 the soldiers would get the beef and pork
general 2020-04-08 23:19:46 the citizens would get wild rabbit
general 2020-04-08 23:20:08 facts
general 2020-04-08 23:20:20 murica government like rabbit consume

general 2020-04-08 23:22:17 take pic of him sleeping
general 2020-04-08 23:22:29 why?
general 2020-04-08 23:23:07 very gently rotate him
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:44:52 many reasons
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:45:22 one the use of blocks and not wedges often makes the build heavier
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:45:27 not enough thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:45:34 not enough lift
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:45:50 the placement of the wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:46:16 and basically everything else
general 2020-04-09 05:04:16 who decided playing that game for <#621452102618578964> was a good idea
general 2020-04-09 05:04:26 i played some more and it is so broken
general 2020-04-09 05:46:30 the jets in the game will straight up stop working mid flight
general 2020-04-09 06:18:17 im getting better
general 2020-04-09 06:18:20 then when i first played
general 2020-04-09 06:43:46 aye dyno is back
general 2020-04-09 06:44:14 <@!155149108183695360>
general 2020-04-09 06:44:19 he online
general 2020-04-09 06:45:13 that is not rick
general 2020-04-09 06:45:25 forgot who that dev is
general 2020-04-09 06:45:53 that is one of the retail tycoon developers
general 2020-04-09 07:11:43 i question obc's choice to play jet wars
general 2020-04-09 07:11:48 it is very broken
general 2020-04-09 07:12:15 and based on the information that you see right away from their discord server
general 2020-04-09 07:12:23 the game has been very much abandoned
general 2020-04-09 18:14:50 Dyno is up
general 2020-04-09 18:14:56 but their website is not
general 2020-04-09 18:15:03 and i need their website rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:34:48 integex started a lot of things
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:05 he was banned for extreme toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:13 and we all liked that he was banned
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:30 whatever happened to him after
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:33 that is what i wonder
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:43 what happens when members are banned
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:35:55 especially those that have been here quite a while
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:36:17 the shop is old
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:36:53 i wonder how many people bought the gamepass after that
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:53:27 observe
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:54:14 unbalanced thrust
general 2020-04-09 18:56:11 <#495286269459300364> <@!249946482726273035>

general 2020-04-09 19:21:49 more free mod logs
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:22:38 i legit do not like it when people ask for ideas on what to build
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:24:22 if you do not know what to build then take a break from the game until you come up with an idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:25:35 i build my own stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:25:46 like just straight from imagination
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:32:33 Explosive Danger
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:33:02 Cancer Belts
general 2020-04-09 19:52:18 rickje is not that rare of a sighting
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:04:06 what did dyno say
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:04:16 what you were warned for
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:04:38 maybe it was in another server
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:05:07 why did you build it backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:07:24 dyno is having issues
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:07:32 so that may be part of the reason
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:07:44 always
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:10:15 obc is kil
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:13:53 maybe mega is wake
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:13:59 or grab
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:14:09 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:24:10 obc steggy wanted to see his mod logs because he got warned while he was sleeping and dyno gave no reason when, why, and by who
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:30:10 too easy though
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:30:30 most of us  actually put effort into the builds that got us into vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:31:37 that is why submarine commander rank needs a block limit
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:33:35 bruh im getting sick of making warship turrets
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:33:57 they never rotate horizontally for me
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:34:25 i have to finish the ship i am working on first
general 2020-04-09 20:36:54 steggy was banned?
general 2020-04-09 20:37:42 obc he was trying to figure out his last warn cause dyno gave him no info on why he was warned
general 2020-04-09 20:37:51 and i think someone else had the same issue
general 2020-04-09 20:38:00 dyno giving no information
general 2020-04-09 20:42:01 rip
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 20:42:40 you left click

general 2020-04-10 05:58:43 im worse at arcade
general 2020-04-10 05:58:55 but the trick is to not be seen

general 2020-04-10 06:15:28 also <@!287779983445721088> listening to synthwave or other music that may keep you calm and focused helps a lot
general 2020-04-10 06:16:10 just hack into you local rhythm bot like i do, set you discord volume to say 30-40, you computer volume 100 or a little lower
general 2020-04-10 06:16:22 and you get the perfect balance of being able to hear everything
general 2020-04-10 06:16:30 whilst the music does interfere
general 2020-04-10 06:20:44 oh my cat

general 2020-04-10 06:28:57 good performance for its tier i have heard
general 2020-04-10 06:29:06 and br
general 2020-04-10 06:29:10 or whatever it is
general 2020-04-10 06:29:38 im not sure

general 2020-04-10 06:30:51 there was a swedish boi that has a 1.5 second reload time
general 2020-04-10 06:31:18 yeah it like a panzer II gun
general 2020-04-10 06:31:23 but faster fire rate
general 2020-04-10 06:45:58 im noticing something with air realistic versus tank realistic
general 2020-04-10 06:46:19 air realistic if you do good you get quite a bit of research points
general 2020-04-10 06:46:34 tank realistic is more silver lions
general 2020-04-10 06:49:54 i have not tried that
general 2020-04-10 06:50:03 so i would not know if it works for me
general 2020-04-10 06:50:11 also i just noticed something
general 2020-04-10 06:50:22 the US has the T34
general 2020-04-10 06:50:33 the Soviet Union has the T-34

general 2020-04-10 15:11:24 no idea what happened to them
general 2020-04-10 15:11:31 and they were not verified
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:24:15 very old
general 2020-04-10 15:25:01 my computer decided to crash war thunder
general 2020-04-10 15:25:36 my computer did something, and it closed war thunder to do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:27:28 yeah i have seen better
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:27:32 and that is bias
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:59:01 wut
general 2020-04-10 17:27:24 there are some simple tutorials on folding
general 2020-04-10 17:27:37 that can be used to fold ships
general 2020-04-10 17:36:37 moc is an it
general 2020-04-10 17:46:04 Rest in Peace Hyperbit

general 2020-04-10 18:57:05 i got a free sandwich <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-04-10 18:57:27 Turkey Italiano Focaccia
general 2020-04-10 19:18:25 really?
general 2020-04-10 19:18:32 the one time i could not be online
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:20:40 enough wing surface
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:54 im pretty sure there is always air above and below the wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:28 only rick knows
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:24:28 no because im not new to the server
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:25:43 depends on your view on big
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:26:17 but i dont know compared to the B-52
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:26:36 likely smaller
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:43 they are more accurate if the pilot is good
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:52 and they can cause a lot of damage
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:35:38 the in game rockets are slow, and only track when near a creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:08 plus to create such a feature the game would have to be re-coded
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:19 like radars and tracking missiles
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:27 mad needs to help
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:39 but there is a sliver of hope he may help
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:37:10 so they can fix bugs
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:37:37 such as pistons not working or flinging, same with motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:37:45 and add more features
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:37:51 decrease save data
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:37:57 basically anything
general 2020-04-10 19:43:42 oi
general 2020-04-10 19:43:43 space

general 2020-04-10 21:02:34 to hide the issues
general 2020-04-10 21:13:06 no act like the channel does not exist

general 2020-04-10 21:23:18 T30
general 2020-04-10 21:24:37 but yeah i yoinked some sort of tank destroyer from like 500 meters away while he was moving and i was chasing him parallel in a test run
general 2020-04-10 22:21:47 they are not invisible
general 2020-04-10 22:27:30 <#498473314445033472>
general 2020-04-10 22:27:34 report it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 16:57:40 are different plane crazy discord communities being taken down, and then being put back up after
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 16:58:24 why is it all the big ones though
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 16:58:33 are they just the ones not following the rules
general 2020-04-11 17:05:33 that is basically every site
general 2020-04-11 17:05:44 and every online service
general 2020-04-11 17:05:47 everything is break
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 17:06:07 wut
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 17:06:25 triangle
general 2020-04-11 17:09:58 yes
general 2020-04-11 17:10:17 shut down one of the few honest games with developers that do honest work
general 2020-04-11 17:10:27 cause cash grab simulators are better
general 2020-04-11 17:10:54 games that take a day to make by noobs that just want money
general 2020-04-11 17:12:18 I do not like Adopt Me or the community, but I respect the effort put into it, same with most other front page games
general 2020-04-11 17:13:58 can you english
general 2020-04-11 17:17:33 That game was hacked to oblivion
general 2020-04-11 17:17:52 i dont even play it because of the hackers
general 2020-04-11 17:18:11 ask the hackers
general 2020-04-11 17:18:18 but they keep killing everyone
general 2020-04-11 17:18:27 destroying the boats
general 2020-04-11 17:18:46 making themselves invisible
general 2020-04-11 17:18:57 taking all the chests that drop
general 2020-04-11 17:19:36 i wonder how im going to be able to do homework
general 2020-04-11 17:19:47 i have fallen behind because of internet load
general 2020-04-11 17:20:06 but that has doubled since my entire area is under spring break
general 2020-04-11 17:20:18 so the internet load has doubled
general 2020-04-11 17:20:23 roblox will not shut it down
general 2020-04-11 17:20:38 plus the dev community will trace the poles back to here
general 2020-04-11 17:20:54 and the youtubers may help
general 2020-04-11 17:21:07 so you would have just doomed this discord server and the game
general 2020-04-11 17:21:23 by becoming enemies with the two most powerful groups on roblox
general 2020-04-11 17:21:28 youtubers and game developers
general 2020-04-11 17:22:24 The hate on Adopt Me is so stupid
general 2020-04-11 17:22:31 And it is making me mad
general 2020-04-11 17:22:42 because it is a rare high quality game
general 2020-04-11 17:22:53 you have no proof
general 2020-04-11 17:23:08 for all we know it could Plane Crazy with its physics
general 2020-04-11 17:23:16 or all the large builds over loading the servers
general 2020-04-11 17:23:40 again you have no proof
general 2020-04-11 17:23:43 you are just saying that
general 2020-04-11 17:23:49 show
general 2020-04-11 17:25:29 No Three times
general 2020-04-11 17:25:53 That is their choice
general 2020-04-11 17:26:20 also the servers breaking is not their fault
general 2020-04-11 17:26:27 they cannot control how many people play
general 2020-04-11 17:26:44 Honestly the community is trash
general 2020-04-11 17:27:01 The community can be deleted
general 2020-04-11 17:27:09 but not the game
general 2020-04-11 17:27:20 it would be worse then having plane crazy deleted
general 2020-04-11 17:28:23 <:LUL:526445157847924736>
general 2020-04-11 17:30:00 also please note
general 2020-04-11 17:30:03 coronavirus
general 2020-04-11 17:30:12 nobody has nothing better to do

general 2020-04-11 17:30:46 nothing better to do

general 2020-04-11 20:35:48 looking to scam
general 2020-04-11 20:36:30 if Mr Beast said he was going to give you money you would actually get money
general 2020-04-11 20:36:55 and a decent sum of money

general 2020-04-11 20:52:44 i dont even know a quarter of NSFW slang
general 2020-04-11 20:57:26 Histon_Shepard
general 2020-04-11 20:57:45 i think
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:12:03 but then you would have to take away his right to vote
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:23:08 you know some players have never seen the map before
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:23:20 so to them it could be literally anywhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:23:32 it could very likely not be on the island
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:24:08 the propellers are regularly shaped though
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:24:28 you mean the engines
general 2020-04-11 21:28:22 it really is not

general 2020-04-11 21:33:56 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
general 2020-04-11 21:34:38 if someone else joked
general 2020-04-11 21:34:44 then you should not share it
general 2020-04-11 21:36:05 bruh the website just cleared all i changed

general 2020-04-11 21:36:42 im making mod applications for my server
general 2020-04-11 21:37:09 classic roblox
general 2020-04-11 21:37:41 i think it might be the hitboxes

general 2020-04-11 21:42:18 either roblox is be dumb
general 2020-04-11 21:42:31 or the hitboxes like when placing are broke
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:43:13 flexing
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:43:16 most likely

general 2020-04-12 17:06:33 because then people would spam cringy songs
general 2020-04-12 17:06:38 and annoy everyone
general 2020-04-12 17:06:56 actually you could the music blocks on cars and drive up to people and annoy them
general 2020-04-12 17:07:06 music blocks are a bad idea
general 2020-04-12 17:07:31 music blocks are a bad idea
general 2020-04-12 17:07:44 even if you just want to use them for a fog horn

general 2020-04-14 22:00:44 so they do not get the money
general 2020-04-14 22:02:59 i honestly do not want scaling block
general 2020-04-14 22:03:12 it takes away from how plane crazy is very unique
general 2020-04-14 22:03:26 most other building games have it
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:10:33 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:10:38 no .wmv
general 2020-04-14 22:13:20 okay i actually connected to my wifi extender this time

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:19:23 vip1 is full
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:19:45 so roblox put me in a public sewer without my permission

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:15:48 anybody got a big black circle emoji that can be put into signs?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:17:48 works wonders
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:22:40 this is what it did
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:23:53 also changed the sign to Co
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:23:57 and i cannot get it back
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:25:52 i broke the signs
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:28:03 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:32:54 
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:33:54 would you rather this OCD triggering off center contraption
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:34:36 cause idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:34:44 and i cant get them centered
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:35:14 they would be centered if there was not a space after the emoji that cant be deleted without taking the emoji with
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 16:36:47 imma leave the cancer guns

general 2020-04-15 18:21:20 really?
general 2020-04-15 18:21:27 big brain
general 2020-04-15 18:26:28 when sky first joined the server
general 2020-04-15 18:26:33 he hated me for some reason
general 2020-04-15 18:26:46 but when he started being all toxic and stuff
general 2020-04-15 18:26:51 he no longer hated me
general 2020-04-15 18:29:20 henlo
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:34:23 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:34:29 .wmv
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:34:43 motor lock does what is not supposed to do
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:46:47 some how the round blocks the locked motors from doing their job
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:53:30 the actual physical block is not touching the cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:54:07 could it be like the games hitboxes or the block's CFrame
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:04:41 i bet whoever owned vip1 shut it down
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:04:50 or forgot to pay to renew it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:06:19 oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:07:10 i was not in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:07:17 so i would not know
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:11:26 i dont know
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:11:28 might be
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:18:28 smol
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:37:21 Mega be evacuating the area
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:37:56 then who is the other demon being summoned?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:38:04 or are they trying to put you back
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:42:22 they should put you back
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:23 why do we build warships
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:35 like destoroyers, cruisers, battlecruisers
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:40 battleships
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:42 aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:46 tanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:51 factories
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:47:23 uhh
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:47:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:48:35 better design is usually more complexity
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:48:40 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:50:29 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:50:47 there are no in game admins beside the devs and a friend of mad
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:52:20 yeah you cannot turn wings to glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:52:23 no idea why
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:52:41 maybe because pvp noobs make near invisible planes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:53:48 you should be able too
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:53:59 could create some nice creations using it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:54:02 windows
general 2020-04-15 20:06:26 there are tutorials on youtube that explain folding if you need help
general 2020-04-15 20:07:24 increase motor torque
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:15:39 somehow this will not move
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:51:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:51:45 hyperbot literally handles upvotes and downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:52:00 i suggested that back when hyperbot was being developed and it was added
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:52:24 nowhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:52:41 <#384025409945337856> does not exist
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:53:15 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:53:28 literally no one but maybe the admins can acess it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:54:18 <@!378555883497586688> is the only one that can access it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:54:27 or at least talks
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:54:35 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:54:38 Soyuz
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:55:00 I dont
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:55:05 i have spaceships though
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:55:31 actually
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:55:37 there is zero gravity
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:06 why do build planes in plane crazy when there is no where to fly to?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:18 why do you build massive ships when you only have a pond?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:28 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:36 also it is fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:49 yes it is
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:56:51 it is fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:57:18 <@!416215683089563649> if you are worried this game is a waste of time then why play <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:58:14 well that is an even bigger waste of time
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:59:07 now you are just sounding like you may be jealous of larger high quality creations
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:00:15 well plane crazy is defiantly not the place to learn
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:00:41 and you can build what would be 6 trillion dollar battleships for free
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:00:51 or aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:00:56 or spaceships
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:01:40 there is literally no point in building a helicopter either
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:01:43 there is no where to fly
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:01:50 and you get literally nothing out of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:01:56 except maybe design aspects
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:02:20 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:02:40 so are spacecraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:02:48 managing warships is a very daunting task
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:03:08 helicopters are basically crumbs that fall under the couch compared to what you can build
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:03:16 unless you add a swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:03:29 then it is 👌
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:04:18 you can build flying aircraft carriers like one or two people did once
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:04:28 but in my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:04:33 and many others
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:04:45 big creations are much more fun to build
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:05:28 im practicing my building skills
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:09:14 the american version of the Su-57 is fun to play
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:12:55 titanic
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:16:36 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:20:57 That might have been the older map
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:21:06 also i remember Idra
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:21:09 i miss Idra
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:21:25 i wish Idra would come back
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:25:30 i liked Idra
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:25:39 he was mod
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:25:55 then he just just like disappeared
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:26:06 saying he was taking a break
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:26:31 but he still left
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:27:51 rick was like the 10 first
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:28:00 to join this discord server
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:28:05 Voxel was the first
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:28:26 i have no idea why
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:28:31 its a mystery
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:28:50 old boy
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:29:28 the old map layout?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:30:02 i have been using plugins that change the website layout
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:30:08 i like the one RBX has
general 2020-04-15 21:34:56 <@!260797229068058634> yes or no
general 2020-04-15 21:34:58 not both
general 2020-04-15 21:35:09 unless you are talking just a mute
general 2020-04-15 21:35:14 like a perm mute
general 2020-04-15 21:38:41 just some random idea of torture
general 2020-04-15 21:38:56 🤔
general 2020-04-15 21:39:30 random thought
general 2020-04-15 21:39:41 involving obc
general 2020-04-15 21:40:14 a chat room about bunnies but obc cant talk in it
general 2020-04-15 21:40:24 or post anything
general 2020-04-15 21:42:57 no
general 2020-04-15 21:43:12 because we cannot post anything in vc's
general 2020-04-15 21:43:14 only talk
general 2020-04-15 21:43:19 and listen to music
general 2020-04-15 21:43:23 and stream
general 2020-04-15 21:43:58 Voxel could always blacklist you
general 2020-04-15 21:45:26 
general 2020-04-15 21:45:47 oh yeah
general 2020-04-15 21:46:45 make a server about bunnies but dont invite obc <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-04-15 21:47:15 or no let him but he cannot speak
general 2020-04-15 21:48:59 AAAAAAHHAHA
general 2020-04-15 21:49:10 my left hand is cramping
general 2020-04-15 21:49:13 help
general 2020-04-15 21:49:16 it hurtd
general 2020-04-15 21:49:39 okay is good now
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:59:07 what does the activate feature on cameras do
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:59:15 i have no idea what it does
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:59:53 if it supposed to toggle use of cameras on and off
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 21:59:56 it does not work
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:04:53 nothing about this seems correct
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:05:06 the upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:05:44 i wonder if people noticed the two little easter eggs and that is why they upvoting
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:05:55 that or they did not read the description
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:06:05 which means when i finish the ship im going to be sad
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:07:14 i wonder if people were judging based off looks or description
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:07:29 if description then i understand downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:07:37 if looks then i understand both
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:08:29 since i said nothing about it being a WIP so i could see downvoting because superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:10:05 ehh depends
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:10:57 ehh
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:11:01 depend on the ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:11:19 such as the Graf Zeppelin
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:11:24 a concept german aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:11:37 if built it would have been the largest aircraft carrier for a long time
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:11:47 but it certainly was not the longest
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:12:57 size usually is not a factor
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:13:04 normally it is detail and scaling
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:15:38 easier to aim
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:15:48 but also easier to get hit
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:23:44 <@!400465835845615616> the max gravity is 1000, not 300
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:23:46 you have to type it in
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:24:01 also ships will not sink at even 1000 gravity
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:25:02 small ships may sink
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:25:32 depending on how much of a ship there is
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:27:04 actually small ships do sink with high gravity
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:27:53 bruh fabric does not even sink an atom
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:27:58 it just like floats
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:28:04 as if the water was solid
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:28:39 grass also floats on water as if it was a solid

general 2020-04-17 07:35:53 with 200 units
general 2020-04-17 07:36:17 i estimate 50000000 soldiers
general 2020-04-17 07:36:26 they launched a full on invasion
general 2020-04-17 07:36:31 and got most of my country
general 2020-04-17 07:36:58 but they backed out because lag, they lost most their troops, and also an experiment

general 2020-04-17 07:37:11 it really hurt both of us
general 2020-04-17 07:37:35 i would have survived for a long time as my capital is very well defended
general 2020-04-17 07:37:49 and my citizens were practically soldiers themselves
general 2020-04-17 07:38:17 only you would not know until the mailman pulls out an assault rifle

general 2020-04-17 07:40:35 and somehow i did the most
general 2020-04-17 07:40:51 possibly because i figured out that you could destroy cities with bombers
general 2020-04-17 07:40:59 and he did not know to look around
general 2020-04-17 07:41:06 instead of forward
general 2020-04-17 07:42:19 and so i took Panama, Jamaica, Haiti, and Dominican Republic
general 2020-04-17 07:42:31 and it took him a while to notice i was there
general 2020-04-17 07:42:39 until he started running from my subs
general 2020-04-17 07:42:54 then he got bored and left
general 2020-04-17 07:43:04 and then japan did a social experiment and regretted it
general 2020-04-17 07:43:20 because my citizens are not very social
general 2020-04-17 07:43:34 they will literally and figuratively kill you
general 2020-04-17 07:43:48 because im best leader
general 2020-04-17 07:43:58 i teach kids how to use a gun
general 2020-04-17 07:44:29 also europe was like
general 2020-04-17 07:44:39 😬
general 2020-04-17 07:44:59 basically every city was its own country
general 2020-04-17 07:45:03 kinda fun to see
general 2020-04-17 07:45:11 okay i sleep
general 2020-04-17 07:45:15 my head hurts
general 2020-04-17 15:21:51 my head hurts
general 2020-04-17 15:22:04 i woke up (kind of) with a headache
general 2020-04-17 15:22:20 and i still feel really odd
general 2020-04-17 15:22:42 almost like that feeling you get split seconds before something happens
general 2020-04-17 15:22:50 like something bad
general 2020-04-17 15:36:36 no
general 2020-04-17 15:36:50 i think
general 2020-04-17 15:36:58 i dunno how that sites work
general 2020-04-17 15:37:12 all the polls i submitted could only be submitted once
general 2020-04-17 16:07:56 imma go practice using rockbets in WT
general 2020-04-17 16:08:21 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-04-17 16:09:50 <@456226577798135808> like no one has done it in roblox
general 2020-04-17 16:09:59 the physics engine cannot be changed like that
general 2020-04-17 16:10:09 also water terrain is the most wonky thing ever
general 2020-04-17 16:10:33 you need custom water in order to make it so water parts from ships
general 2020-04-17 16:11:01 that would be way to hard
general 2020-04-17 16:11:21 the only game i that has done something like that is Cruise Ship Tycoon
general 2020-04-17 16:11:33 but the ships stay at one height
general 2020-04-17 16:11:40 and they are predefined ships
general 2020-04-17 16:11:48 not the chaos plane crazy has
general 2020-04-17 16:12:05 yes but they cannot do the parting
general 2020-04-17 16:12:08 that is like
general 2020-04-17 16:12:17 literally impossible
general 2020-04-17 16:12:26 roblox would have to it themselves
general 2020-04-17 16:12:34 and custom water is not even needed
general 2020-04-17 16:12:58 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/507673335816126509/700737818128941083
general 2020-04-17 16:14:32 really the best this rick and mad can do with water
general 2020-04-17 16:14:38 is add effects like splashing
general 2020-04-17 16:14:43 and more advanced propwash
general 2020-04-17 16:35:17 that is a roblox issue
general 2020-04-17 16:35:20 with all games
general 2020-04-17 16:51:07 that is fake
general 2020-04-17 16:51:18 China is literally not saying anything
general 2020-04-17 16:51:25 China
general 2020-04-17 16:51:28 is a communist country
general 2020-04-17 16:51:39 they will not say anything for the good of the world
general 2020-04-17 16:52:11 they accused the United States for fear mongering the world
general 2020-04-17 16:52:16 acting as if it was a big deal
general 2020-04-17 16:52:33 after China had reached 80k cases
general 2020-04-17 16:52:45 that number stopped changing
general 2020-04-17 16:53:26 yes
general 2020-04-17 16:53:30 locking everybody up
general 2020-04-17 16:53:38 and shutting down the media
general 2020-04-17 16:53:47 nobody can talk to the outside world
general 2020-04-17 16:53:55 so no new information is getting out
general 2020-04-17 16:54:07 and if those numbers were actually true
general 2020-04-17 16:54:14 why is nobody else using the same tactic?
general 2020-04-17 16:54:41 China
general 2020-04-17 16:55:11 actually if you do not understand why that number is so low then im not even going to argue any more
general 2020-04-17 16:57:00 you cannot fake a disease :/
general 2020-04-17 16:57:23 granted you can fake being sick
general 2020-04-17 16:57:29 but you cannot fake a pandemic
general 2020-04-17 16:58:40 cause they want to look like they have i under control
general 2020-04-17 16:59:00 as much as i wish those numbers are true
general 2020-04-17 16:59:07 sadly they are not
general 2020-04-17 17:00:06 the fact you do not know that is very sad
general 2020-04-17 17:00:18 one word
general 2020-04-17 17:00:22 China
general 2020-04-17 17:01:27 nah i think they were mass burning of those that died
general 2020-04-17 17:01:42 not burning people alive
general 2020-04-17 17:32:53 i like how youtube is advertising free robux scams and NSFW
general 2020-04-17 17:33:24 i came across about 500 when i search one roblox video
general 2020-04-17 17:42:39 yeah i heard something like that
general 2020-04-17 17:42:47 other countries reported mutated strands
general 2020-04-17 17:51:40 yes
general 2020-04-17 17:51:59 why?
general 2020-04-17 17:52:05 im doing war funder
general 2020-04-17 17:52:29 i guess
general 2020-04-17 17:52:37 i like call war funder
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 17:59:40 fix the big hol
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:06:43 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:07:08 dyno is crashing in servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:10:55 ye
general 2020-04-17 18:17:38 bruh i keep getting all the bad maps in WT
general 2020-04-17 18:17:48 the ones i have never even knew existed
general 2020-04-17 18:17:59 and the ones that have no cover what so ever
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:19:06 eh no
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:19:19 that is not a professional map
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:19:35 that is something terrain generation would make
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:19:49 and then rick added other custom bits
general 2020-04-17 18:23:13 i swear
general 2020-04-17 18:23:17 this is actually very sad
general 2020-04-17 18:25:25 some tanks are literally invisible until they are literally touching you
general 2020-04-17 18:28:06 5 games in a row i have been killed the first 2 minutes
general 2020-04-17 18:28:11 this is depressing
general 2020-04-17 18:28:28 i have worse history with war gaming
general 2020-04-17 18:28:49 who tried scamming rick?
general 2020-04-17 18:29:29 also im already annoyed with WoT adds
general 2020-04-17 18:29:37 along with free robux scams and NSFW ads
general 2020-04-17 18:30:00 tell that to youtube
general 2020-04-17 18:38:43 i would not be surprised if Gaijin decided to advertise me to the enemy like a Las Vegas casino
general 2020-04-17 18:39:13 because i am always hidden better then my team who decides that a cow pasture is the best cover
general 2020-04-17 18:39:45 though i am in a chonky boy which does not help
general 2020-04-17 18:39:56 maybe i will park in a building instead
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:01:01 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:03:21 where is quote?
the-dump 2020-04-17 19:04:59 i accidentally sent rick an invite to some random server i was
the-dump 2020-04-17 19:05:07 like i clicked 5 things at once
the-dump 2020-04-17 19:05:14 and it sent him an invalid invite
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:06:43 rip Superidra
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:07:30 i bet he is going to show the supercarrier
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:08:22 or the oil rig
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:08:28 the supercarrier or the oil rig
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:19 oh gog
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:21 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:24 my eyes
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:11:38 that is good
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:42:22 somehow
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:15:50 <@!416215683089563649> there used to be ranks based on how fast you could get a build or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:15:59 it was likely around there or higher
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:17:38 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:17:53 it was removed a long time ago
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:18:00 early 2019
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:18:19 old Speed Demon ranks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:18:29 from earlier years of this server
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:41 they do
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:49 but the fireworks are actually not the best
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:59 they have short range
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:11 they are also loud af
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:33 fireworks are winter
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:39 same with sparkler
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:57 summer is lava spitter and stuff for water craft
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:19 pretty boat
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:36 make sure not to put anything Paradian related on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:23:04 otherwise every torpedo within a 100 kilometer radius is now headed your way
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:24:17 a while ago a 8-10 part carrier was made
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:24:21 10 plots long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:24:51 actually it was shorter
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:25:07 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/627327690562601010
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:25:12 but it was modular
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:28:17 i would prefer a timed reload
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:28:29 like 5-8 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:05 because the the reload on rockets can be half a second to 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:15 based on how long the rockets fly
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:20 and it is stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:26 i do not understand why
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:56 but rickje will not fix it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:59 since we want it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:30:10 even though it is the easiest thing ever
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:30:31 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:30:32 map
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:37:21 materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:37:37 i mean materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:38:08 you can place glass blocks by selecting it in the materials tab
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:38:35 its not in the build section
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:38:42 it is in materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:38:55 along with a collection of other materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:39:12 such as wood, metal, rusty metal, ice, slate, grass and other junk
general 2020-04-17 20:53:13 If you are ever depressed
general 2020-04-17 20:53:20 go to Dairy Queen
general 2020-04-17 20:53:23 and get some food there
general 2020-04-17 21:41:29 robox broke
general 2020-04-17 21:41:30 again
general 2020-04-17 21:41:40 my internet nearly went with it
general 2020-04-17 21:42:05 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-04-17 21:42:12 totally am not responsible
general 2020-04-17 21:45:58 people need to stop playing roblox so much
general 2020-04-17 21:46:06 go play an offline game
general 2020-04-17 21:46:09 like minecraft
general 2020-04-17 21:46:20 i know it is quarantine
general 2020-04-17 21:46:22 and i hate it
general 2020-04-18 03:44:58 leaves
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:45:39 wait pyro
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:45:50 mods are bad at job

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:47:44 the hull on my WIP is around 4k
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:58:17 why are you recording?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:59:18 and why are you using roblox's recorder?
the-dump 2020-04-18 04:09:06 his mom punished him for not adding more wedges
the-dump 2020-04-18 04:09:27 shaved all his hair off
general 2020-04-18 04:12:50 WT for some reason will not let me watch replays
general 2020-04-18 04:12:52 just like
general 2020-04-18 04:13:04 kicks me out after one minute
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:22:37 wait they changed designer ranks?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:22:57 oh so that means peoples rank would have to be purged
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:24:54 i mean they should purge otherwise we might have a modeler and inventor incident
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:25:34 you are fine if in hof

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:43:46 like go on google
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:43:54 go to the roblox website
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:44:01 and download it from there
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:44:26 windows 10 client is only for alts when you need a keycard in jailbreak
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:44:44 .wmv
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:44:48 kill
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:45:55 he broke dancing
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:48:51 i dont build
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:49:03 im inactive ingame
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:49:12 although i just live here
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:49:35 the staff has to vote
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:49:38 admin and mod
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:50:10 vip gen?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:50:28 oh so the vip gang gets to vote
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:50:35 i thought it was just staff
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:50:44 well
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:51:12 i had like a microscopic amount of hope that i might get into hof with my build
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:51:20 but now i know vip gen will vote
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:51:49 i cannot write an entire story on the ship i am building
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:52:06 because anything more then a sentence is not even there
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:54:00 i wish there was a solid version of half wedge 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:54:10 like that large chunk missing was fill
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:54:36 i have no idea what they are
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:55:10 <@456226577798135808> vip gen is basically <#497142796961054721> but for specially ranked people
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:55:20 contest winners i know for a fact
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:56:29 yeah i had a sliver of hope until i was told it took vip gen to get in
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:56:43 because at least the staff team could be trusted
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:56:46 well almost
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:57:44 unless vip members can vote without bias and go only for design
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:59:09 i wish half wedge 2 had a variant where this chunk was filled
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:00:24 dyno did it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:00:30 heh
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:01:04 dyno is broken
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:01:12 bots cannot be biased
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:01:21 unless you are hyperbot
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:01:28 then you are very biased
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:02:04 dyno is bad but there is nothing better then dyno that can be found
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:02:44 unless hyperbrit can have moderation capabilites
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:02:53 which is does not other then unde gun
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:03:04 hyperbrit

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:15 when did you start playing?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:26 cause my ship is literally the one that exists
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:33 unless someone cloned me
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:36 a month ago
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:42 then yeah you saw it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:07:57 cause i like cannot focus on it to save my life
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:08:10 i dont build slow
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:08:14 i take my time
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:08:18 i also cannot focus
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:08:23 which does not help
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:08:38 also i had no desire to work on it until now
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:09:06 i have 4 days 17 hours and 15 minutes on my Marine alt
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:09:12 which is the one i am using
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:25 i think is it funny how i had like started working on a battlecruiser
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:27 custom one
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:33 abandoned it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:35 came back
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:38 scraped it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:55 started rebuilding it and my building skills
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:10:57 just like
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:11:14 i skipped many levels
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:12:15 i think building the front 1/8 of a 1:1234123423 scale spaceship helped
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:12:20 which is also custom
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:12:39 the Endalaus
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 05:12:47 i dunno

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 06:29:57 also i really should start sketching ship designs before i build them
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 06:30:05 it is starting to bite back at me
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 06:32:20 they do

bug-reports 2020-04-18 16:29:25 i jumped out of seat when cycling through cameras (because i accidentally clicked C and had to go through the millions of cameras used for folding and whatnot) hoping to reset my position back to my player instead of the cameras view
bug-reports 2020-04-18 16:30:21 except when i do that it focuses the camera on one single camera as if it was the player
bug-reports 2020-04-18 16:30:27 and it is that one single camera

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:27:43 wut
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:28:04 those guns though
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:28:09 why the 5 one?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:28:42 that is probably the worst part of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:29:11 change it to a dual mount to fit with the front turret
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:31:35 my first ship

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:31:59 Paradian destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:32:31 honestly my first ship is not that bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:32:42 it was really good for the time it was built
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:32:58 and pyro that ship is not bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:33:04 that camo is a little wonk
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:33:16 but it is not bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:33:51 also superstructure lacks detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:35:44 this was my second pic
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:35:49 or ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:35:51 wahtever

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:39:01 well techincally the same ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:39:09 but different
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:42:20 this is what im working on now which is literally the Harmington rebuilt
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:42:30 im going to have to change that superstucture though
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:42:31 i dont like it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:43:06 custom
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:43:11 i always build custom
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:54:14 why is the nose and cockpit so blocky
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:54:24 and the guns so large
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:03:15 speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:07:36 looking better
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:08:26 use text blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:08:30 and emojis
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:09:05 ⚫
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:09:51 also there are much better looking designs then that one
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:10:02 without that large top bit

general 2020-04-18 21:05:22 Halifax accident?
general 2020-04-18 21:05:40 wasnt that the most powerful non nuclear explosion that ever occured
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:10:00 what the
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:10:08 what is happening there
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:11:03 i have no idea what is happening in that photo
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:11:18 that is a plane?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:11:52 like so much needs to be removed to make it seem like a plne
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:12:06 and there is no resemblance to a tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:12:42 no not at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:13:06 to make it a tank you need to delete it and make a tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:13:20 to make it a plane you need to remove basically most of the build
general 2020-04-18 21:14:38 that would not even happen unless somebody placed an explosive in the ship itself
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:18:47 nobody really cares about genre
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:19:09 just detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:19:19 and scaling
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:19:26 sometimes function

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:57:36 after
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:58:41 not the best pic because the gray pert separating all the metal stuff has come loose
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 21:58:50 supposed to fall half a block into the deck
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 22:00:21 like that
general 2020-04-18 22:01:38 also what mode
general 2020-04-18 22:02:01 arcade or realistic
general 2020-04-18 22:02:34 <@!454570394343702529> moment

general 2020-04-18 22:04:29 also i dont play much
general 2020-04-18 22:04:51 not counting the 3 consecutive months i played

general 2020-04-18 22:05:58 i have made it my mission to kill T-34

general 2020-04-18 22:09:04 i can hide
general 2020-04-18 22:09:05 in like
general 2020-04-18 22:09:12 i could hide on Ceres
general 2020-04-18 22:09:18 and i would still be shot
general 2020-04-18 22:09:38 you know what Ceres is?
general 2020-04-18 22:10:07 Asteroid Belt dwarf planet
general 2020-04-18 22:11:26 many ways
general 2020-04-18 22:11:51 it is not that hard to mess up
general 2020-04-18 22:12:27 i sit down so i cannot be blamed for soaking the toilet seat
general 2020-04-18 22:12:47 everybody does
general 2020-04-18 22:12:59 no
general 2020-04-18 22:13:02 i can aim
general 2020-04-18 22:13:05 but my brother cant
general 2020-04-18 22:13:32 and i used to get blamed for missing the bowl

general 2020-04-18 22:18:22 no
general 2020-04-18 22:18:30 no need for toilets when you have trees
general 2020-04-18 22:19:33 trees are big

general 2020-04-18 22:20:27 that is why you elevate
general 2020-04-18 22:20:28 other then that
general 2020-04-18 22:20:31 no need to aim
general 2020-04-18 22:21:25 well that is your problem
general 2020-04-18 22:21:44 but when you in water
general 2020-04-18 22:21:49 absolutely no need to aim
general 2020-04-18 22:22:01 because you are not going to hit your target <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-04-18 22:22:20 that is a bad idea
general 2020-04-18 22:22:26 then you will just get your face
general 2020-04-18 22:22:46 then pee

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:51:55 question of the day
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:52:13 why is vip1 literally always full?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:52:24 and vip2
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:52:32 rarely has more then 2 people in at a time
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:53:12 if vip2 even has anyone online in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:53:52 empty other than me
general 2020-04-19 14:56:06 you cannot actually stream in the actually channel for streaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 14:58:52 <:wot:695654208837255219>
general 2020-04-19 15:02:55 i go in vip2 when vip1 is full
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 15:11:45 motor torque most likely
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 15:12:02 motor likes to do some wierd stuff above 99 torque
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 15:13:49 you dont because rover keeps going down

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:38:00 pyramid is like that one block that no one cares about
general 2020-04-21 03:38:31 it did not update though
general 2020-04-21 03:38:39 i also i do not have the non steam version
general 2020-04-21 03:38:43 and now it works
general 2020-04-21 03:38:49 just had to kill task manager
general 2020-04-21 03:38:55 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-04-21 03:39:11 not for me
general 2020-04-21 03:39:20 it rarely updates
general 2020-04-21 03:39:31 when it does it is either in the background where i do not notice it
general 2020-04-21 03:39:47 you just have bad computer
general 2020-04-21 03:40:05 not talking to you tall
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:41:32 one of the updates broke my ships or any fold using cameras
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:41:39 have to replace them all
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:41:43 with a different keybind
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:42:04 otherwise if i fold i have to cycle through 5000 different camera veiws
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:42:40 for me the way i design my folds
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:42:47 i literally had to replace every single camera
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:43:26 since i will have anchor blocks for each major fold section
general 2020-04-21 03:44:06 you literally
general 2020-04-21 03:44:23 just jumped in the conversation
general 2020-04-21 03:44:40 as if you were here the entire time and you originally started the conversation
general 2020-04-21 03:44:56 and not contributing to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:48:20 i like just realized
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:48:39 its interesting how my server being a mid sized one
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:48:47 was the first community server
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:48:51 and the oldest
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:49:12 has the least issues other then dyno being poo poo
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:49:13 and rover
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:49:24 and has like almost no one breaking the rules
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:49:44 and never been removed from <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:49:57 rover was offline like always
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:51:33 also why does the chat box seem much larger and the text smaller
bug-reports 2020-04-21 04:10:48 hitbox
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:15:33 i just noticed
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:15:56 the lack of admins in my server
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:16:05 like the only admin in my server is Voxel
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:16:29 all the other ones have 3 or all
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:16:57 kinda weird tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:17:20 i wonder if its because i have no modlogs at all and so the admins trust that i wont do anything stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:17:49 and voxel only joined my server to help me setup rover and never has spoken since
bug-reports 2020-04-21 04:18:47 trail blocks are not saving color for some reason
bug-reports 2020-04-21 04:19:00 the particle emitter part is being saved
bug-reports 2020-04-21 04:19:11 and the if the base is the same color as the emitter it saves
bug-reports 2020-04-21 04:19:22 but when they are different the base does not save
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:24:41 i have no reason to get mod-logs
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:25:13 https://gyazo.com/7658a9793ca7b0c73433247177a562d4
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:25:21 i have fallen victim once again
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:25:35 that or the range find just hates me
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 04:25:41 because it is givng many trouble
general 2020-04-21 04:44:51 yeah im not liking the browser version of discord
general 2020-04-21 04:45:06 i made an alt discord account to do some testing
general 2020-04-21 04:45:10 and it took over the app
general 2020-04-21 04:45:19 so now im stuck in the browser
general 2020-04-21 04:45:21 send help
general 2020-04-21 04:46:33 however
general 2020-04-21 04:51:11 alt account shenanigans
general 2020-04-21 04:52:47 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-04-21 04:59:14 either dyno is broke again
general 2020-04-21 04:59:18 or discord is broke
general 2020-04-21 05:04:19 <@!252094891448860673> <@!492922755344367616> is saying bad stuff and i need your help also since i ping
general 2020-04-21 05:05:24 now voxel are you willing to help me with something?
general 2020-04-21 05:06:04 you responded so you agree
general 2020-04-21 05:06:26 Voxel is dead <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
general 2020-04-21 05:06:40 i will just continue the endless troubleshoot
general 2020-04-21 05:06:43 and abuse of clones
general 2020-04-21 05:17:08 im honestly confused with dyno right now
general 2020-04-21 05:17:27 im abusing an alt account of mine
general 2020-04-21 05:17:53 i muted it yet it was able to talk still
general 2020-04-21 05:18:18 which the role dyno assigns is based off of discord permissions
general 2020-04-21 05:18:43 so a muted member could literally get as many permissions as the server owner
general 2020-04-21 05:18:56 but when i do a timed mute

general 2020-04-21 05:51:30 i had to a whole group of other stuff
general 2020-04-21 05:51:57 bruh dyno just became a verified bot at this moment
general 2020-04-21 05:52:14 and im watching as all the shard clusters go offline due to errors
general 2020-04-21 05:52:40 watching the entire system crash is cool
general 2020-04-21 05:58:54 Dyno has many more utilities
general 2020-04-21 05:59:08 So far I have not had to use Dyno while in down times
general 2020-04-21 05:59:51 Mee6 has the same thing though
general 2020-04-21 06:00:06 the only other feature used is maybe the leveling system
general 2020-04-21 06:00:32 yeah
general 2020-04-21 06:04:05 dyno just completely wiped out
general 2020-04-21 06:04:20 the website and all clusters have straight up crashed
general 2020-04-21 06:04:48 possibly including premium clusters which are more stable due to low load
general 2020-04-21 06:05:57 oh its coming back
general 2020-04-21 06:06:17 yay
general 2020-04-21 06:06:56 fun watching as the clusters go down
general 2020-04-21 06:07:15 like watching sensors fail on a reactor of sorts as it spirals to the land of big boom
general 2020-04-21 06:10:38 yay i got the discord app back

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:28:46 despite the holes in some parts of the hull that i wish could be filled but 1x2 half wedge up does not have a solid variant like its 1x1 counterpart

general 2020-04-21 06:38:57 the world revolves around the sun
general 2020-04-21 06:39:13 which revolves around the center of the galaxy
general 2020-04-21 06:39:39 at the center of the galaxy is a supermassive blackhole known as Sagittarius A
general 2020-04-21 06:40:05 our galaxy does not revolve around any body in the universe however
general 2020-04-21 06:40:27 instead it is one a collision course with a galaxy of similar size
general 2020-04-21 06:40:37 knows as the Andromeda Galaxy
general 2020-04-21 06:40:48 it is also filled with boomer stars

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:43:29 no asked that after they fixed motor2
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:43:49 why would you put a suspension and spring together?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:44:36 there are better ways to do that
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:44:43 none that i can think off
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:44:53 i just know there are many autoloading cannons

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 21:52:44 never
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 22:51:32 i was going to say that is a good start for an ironclad
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 22:51:36 just need the hull
the-dump 2020-04-21 23:04:55 its funny because it is true
the-dump 2020-04-21 23:07:10 i like how we had the lowest number of unemployment claims

general 2020-04-21 23:09:50 like the rocket nozzle moves
general 2020-04-21 23:09:57 the steer the rocket in flight
general 2020-04-21 23:10:11 though you have no roll control
general 2020-04-21 23:11:19 like it cannot use helium
general 2020-04-21 23:11:35 and i assume 180 gravity in case you have the gamepass or a vip server
general 2020-04-21 23:11:57 and no hover thrusters
general 2020-04-21 23:12:05 it says it all in the requirements
general 2020-04-21 23:12:42 you use traditional means
general 2020-04-21 23:12:59 thrusters, jets, propellers, magnet drive, conveyor drive
general 2020-04-21 23:13:47 also 2.8 second reload

general 2020-04-21 23:14:59 set graphics lower?
general 2020-04-21 23:15:39 if the launcher wont start that is likely not a GPU issue
general 2020-04-21 23:15:56 it is likely memory or CPU
general 2020-04-21 23:16:01 or it could be corrupt
general 2020-04-21 23:16:20 uninstalling and reinstalling should help
general 2020-04-21 23:16:26 if it is corrupt

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:16:04 vertical motors sound weird
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:16:17 but when you imagine them as powered hinges
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:16:24 they sound good
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:27:31 i looked at it and saw the eiffel tower
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:27:38 looked at it again and saw a cell tower
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:27:50 then i looked closer and saw low framerate
general 2020-04-22 18:42:25 ye
general 2020-04-22 18:43:26 if hank would stop leaking the new map he would not have been banned, and maybe we would have a new map
general 2020-04-22 18:43:34 but he was being dumb
general 2020-04-22 18:43:41 and here

general 2020-04-22 18:47:12 he is trying to manipulate his server into making obc look bad
general 2020-04-22 18:47:27 he is trying to turn people against the moderation team here
general 2020-04-22 18:48:38 i think he would try against rick but that would be counter productive for him <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-04-22 18:49:15 he used terrain generation for this map
general 2020-04-22 18:49:20 also terrain generatio succ
general 2020-04-22 18:49:36 yeah there is terraforming
general 2020-04-22 18:49:45 such as the mountains and the train area

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:03:23 oh great
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:03:27 saving is broken again
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:03:42 this time smoke pipes
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:30:31 its jammed<:Wack:559530123284578326>
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:31:15 wait no its not
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:31:25 the turret is just turning slow as heck
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:32:39 why is motor2 so freaking broken
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:32:46 the torque needs to be higher
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:34:41 but it cannot go higher than 99 otherwise you flung to inf * 10^100 speeds
general 2020-04-22 19:44:48 what are we looking at
general 2020-04-22 19:45:07 what are you pointing out
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:47:32 5358 blocks rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:47:54 and it is like ~40% done
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:48:22 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:48:27 that is overkill
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:53:19 oh yay
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:53:39 nothing seems to be saving on my ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:53:41 color wise
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:53:55 trail blocks, smoke blocks, conveyor blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 19:54:39 imma post in <#498473314445033472> so im not spamming pics in here
bug-reports 2020-04-22 19:57:23 this old, but still accurate shows the interior of the gun barrel having being black
bug-reports 2020-04-22 19:57:51 however now it is not
bug-reports 2020-04-22 19:59:21 the conveyor block should be the same color as the darker block next to it, however i do not have a good pic showing when it still had its color, and the conveyor part was also colored now it is not
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:00:20 this pic is older, and is the first example of this glitch occurring on the trail block
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:00:36 
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:01:51 there was one occurrence where a small portion of blocks would not save, and was reverted to the last save, but the rest of the ship saved
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:02:14 i did not get a pics as i wanted to try and reproduce it again but with no success
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:02:46 this only seems to occur switching servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:03:11 rick check <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:03:19 tons of evidence
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:06:01 i want to ping rick to get him into <#498473314445033472> see he can check the save scripts
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:06:28 i have three instances on one save showing a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:10:26 i wanted him **in** <#498473314445033472> not <#384021699466756107> <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:10:43 unless you just pinged him to be funny
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 20:11:07 in that case <:BanHammer:507685761496252420>
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:13:37 i dont have a pic of the debug menu in a server that the save glitched in, but hopefully this shows something
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:15:09 also scratch the conveyor color not having a pic with them not being glitched
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:15:37 the top pic shows them over and to each side of the bridge
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:17:46 thank you

general 2020-04-22 21:00:52 the only issues are the little kids that use the playgrounds for their furry conventions
general 2020-04-22 21:01:16 everyone else scatters like American settlers looking for land to farm
general 2020-04-22 21:01:37 and some people no joke colonize land within the park and create kingdoms
general 2020-04-22 21:02:59 also i had to wrestle my bike, a hand powered air pump to fill up the tires, the tires, and the nozzle for the pump

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:22:02 nah you need to be admin to get rank
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:22:10 to much power for the mods
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:22:17 they could overthrow the government
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:23:03 but you need to be ranked

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:44:30 > i have a few dozen drawings of mech blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:45:26 you literally said you drew a drawing
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:46:05 why are you trying to argue against what you said?
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:47:06 i know it is a noun
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:47:13 and yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:52:22 why?
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:53:00 you could retrofit a building and get a shipwright rank
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:53:22 i did the same thing to get the shipwright rank
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:53:28 though not the IV one

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:55:50 is the voting fair though
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 21:55:56 is there any bias in it

general 2020-04-23 02:49:54 he did it near an open window
general 2020-04-23 02:50:01 so i just noticed when i stepped in it
general 2020-04-23 02:51:03 he keeps doing that but no one can catch him the act so punishing him will not help at all
general 2020-04-23 02:51:28 since dogs will not know what is bad until they get punished during or right after they do it
general 2020-04-23 02:51:34 so they know what exactly they did
general 2020-04-23 02:51:40 gah so annoying

general 2020-04-25 06:17:22 but the M4A1 has more armor
general 2020-04-25 06:17:26 but it is slow
general 2020-04-25 06:17:31 the Chaffee is quick
general 2020-04-25 06:17:37 but does not have the best armor
general 2020-04-25 06:18:13 Chaffee is often a threat however

general 2020-04-25 19:14:35 Hyperbot could be able to do that
general 2020-04-25 19:14:47 but Rick would have to program something into the game

general 2020-04-25 19:49:50 it is a 1000% chance of victory for them

general 2020-04-25 21:33:31 what the heck is happening to me in war thunder is not at in the slightest bit of a fraction of a decimal percent natural
general 2020-04-25 21:34:19 i always get sniped

general 2020-04-25 21:36:13 that catches and explodes when a rock hits it
general 2020-04-25 21:36:20 now sometimes i do very good
general 2020-04-25 21:36:43 but that is the basics of what is happening lately
general 2020-04-25 21:37:47 also i can be seen through walls apparently
general 2020-04-25 21:38:08 that or people have incredible spatial awareness
general 2020-04-25 21:38:17 that i could not match
general 2020-04-25 21:39:08 which is the most likely because the anti cheat system wont let me in half the time because of my anti virus keeps checking war thunder for any threats

general 2020-04-26 18:51:33 but they are bad
general 2020-04-26 18:51:52 plus cannons could makes builds look more pretty
general 2020-04-26 18:52:09 instead of having cylinders
general 2020-04-26 18:52:19 you have actual barrels that look like barrels

plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:50:56 actually a 5 year old could have a higher IQ then most of us here
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:51:25 <@!416215683089563649> IQ is not age dependent
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:51:52 so Darkz could totally be smarter then you at any age
general 2020-04-26 20:19:38 I GET THE BROWNIE

general 2020-04-26 20:32:43 very
general 2020-04-26 20:32:46 very easy
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:36:48 i thought of something stupid in my sleep
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:37:18 imagine something like signs
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:37:36 that are not collidable
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:38:00 but they will weld parts together with the click of a button
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:38:13 so like you could attach folds together
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:38:59 almost like the KSP mods Kerbal Attachment Systems if you are familiar with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:39:37 basically it allows you to connect sections of space stations or whatever together as if it was one section
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:39:42 reducing lag in the process
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:39:49 it is basically the same thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:39:56 and it reduces lag
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:40:04 especially for larger builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:41:14 yeah so im not going to suggest it
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:41:31 also it has an extremely low chance of being added
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 20:41:54 like everything else but this especially

general 2020-04-29 04:46:53 yes but im talking about war thunder
general 2020-04-29 04:47:01 where you need easy access to everything
general 2020-04-29 04:47:13 to maximize combat performance
general 2020-04-29 04:47:28 and so you can commit in-human reactions
general 2020-04-29 04:47:56 U and J are in the middle of the keyboard
general 2020-04-29 04:48:18 way out of the way
general 2020-04-29 04:48:36 better for stuff that is not critical
general 2020-04-29 04:50:29 gah im mad
general 2020-04-29 04:50:46 i might have to rebind basically my entire keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 04:53:34 maybe
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 04:54:27 nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 04:54:28 :(
general 2020-04-29 04:55:18 i could bind flaps control to MB4 and MB5
general 2020-04-29 04:55:24 but that is for elevators
general 2020-04-29 04:55:32 mouse button
general 2020-04-29 04:55:50 6
general 2020-04-29 04:56:09 no idea
general 2020-04-29 04:56:59 oh i figured it out
general 2020-04-29 04:57:06 i was looking in the wrong spot
general 2020-04-29 04:58:03 there was literally an option, in the main control screen, to disable mouse wheel control for the throttle
general 2020-04-29 04:58:09 which i never really used
general 2020-04-29 04:58:26 except for fine tuning throttle
general 2020-04-29 04:58:56 which i only do to prevent me J'ing out due to boredom
general 2020-04-29 05:06:57 yes modlogs
general 2020-04-29 05:07:00 i have none
general 2020-04-29 05:16:43 typical

general 2020-04-29 05:19:57 could be a week
general 2020-04-29 05:20:00 or a month
general 2020-04-29 05:20:05 or a year
general 2020-04-29 05:20:12 maybe terminated
general 2020-04-29 05:20:19 which is a lose cause
general 2020-04-29 05:20:43 since even star members struggle severely when it comes to saving their accounts
general 2020-04-29 05:21:00 which goes to show how bad the roblox moderation system
general 2020-04-29 05:21:16 cant even save the people roblox worships
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:21:46 im lucky

general 2020-04-29 20:11:26 yeah that is poo
general 2020-04-29 20:13:53 no im not an expert
general 2020-04-29 20:13:59 and that is basically all nations
general 2020-04-29 20:14:16 bombers not so much
general 2020-04-29 20:15:09 but attackers, strike fighters, multi-role fighters, dive bombers (sometimes), and fighters (MURICA) often have bombs or rockets on the wings
general 2020-04-29 20:17:05 there might be a technical advantage
general 2020-04-29 20:17:11 but none that i know

general 2020-04-29 20:39:14 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
general 2020-04-29 20:39:29 that game is not at all a horror game
general 2020-04-29 20:39:44 granted you can make horror themed parks or rides
general 2020-04-29 20:39:53 but that only happens 1% of the time

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 21:03:32 slow
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 21:03:57 slow speeds are only acceptable if you phase shift
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 21:04:48 like this
general 2020-04-29 21:24:14 i feel like Gaijin buffed the P-23A
general 2020-04-29 21:24:19 it feels better to fly
general 2020-04-29 21:24:35 and i decimated 3 targets
general 2020-04-29 21:24:48 and by decimated
general 2020-04-29 21:24:53 i mean evaporated
general 2020-04-29 21:25:13 maneuverability is much better
general 2020-04-29 21:25:27 now increase self downvoting

general 2020-04-29 21:33:50 it is confirmed
general 2020-04-29 21:33:52 never
general 2020-04-29 21:33:53 use
general 2020-04-29 21:33:55 boosters
general 2020-04-29 21:34:13 else you get sliced and diced and thrown onto Gordon Ramsey's frying pan
general 2020-04-29 21:35:10 also i want to point out

general 2020-04-29 21:35:32 new era of german technology
general 2020-04-29 21:36:38 also i like how ground RB gives you more points for getting shot then air RB does you getting killed
general 2020-04-29 21:46:27 air RB sucks
general 2020-04-29 21:46:39 but it is fun
general 2020-04-29 21:46:58 and if you actually manage to not get killed it is actually rewarding

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:17:10 why are the seats exposed to the sides?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:17:46 also that engine could be much better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:18:53 you could use jet engines or thrusters in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:17 then it will look bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:13 i said in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:24 YES
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:30 you put them in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:33 IN
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:01 customs engines generally look better on aircraft that large
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:18 since the regular propeller engines are to small
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:24 for that aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:50 are you reading everything i say?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:16 You replace the ugly prop with a custom engine
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:19 to get the speed and power
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:26 you hide jet engines or thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:28 INSIDE
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:31 the fuselage

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:26:35 just in case you need references to biplane construction <@!402171686453116929>
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:27:48 then you have obviously not played plane crazy long enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:35 > i literally just said a custom engine doesnt provide enough thrust TWICE
<@!402171686453116929>
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:41 you obviously do care
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:29:39 yes but you refuse to replace the propeller engine only because you dont want to sacrifice the thrust?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:07 no i was following up with your concern about not having enough thrust to make the biplane fly
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:28 i mean replace it with a custom, better looking one
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:54 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:55 that is why
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:57 you put
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:05 thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:09 or jet engines
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:10 in the

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:29 and so are all the other veterans saying the same thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:35 he is obviously not reading what i am saying
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:41 or at least all of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:43 the key points
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:07 reading what i say helps too <@!402171686453116929>
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:35:05 i was literally only giving constructive criticism and tips but okay
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:36:06 words are not my strong suite
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:38:43 i can do that around noon
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:38:48 or when i have more energy
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:39:09 or if determined an entire novel

general 2020-04-29 22:49:52 i think

general 2020-04-29 23:01:40 mad premium payout
general 2020-04-29 23:02:00 probably
general 2020-04-29 23:02:04 depends on what bent
general 2020-04-29 23:02:16 i can do that
general 2020-04-30 03:19:59 lovely
general 2020-04-30 03:20:14 but i assume that is to make room for the landing gear
general 2020-04-30 03:20:22 that is even more off centered
general 2020-04-30 03:22:03 landing gear is just extra weight on the aircraft
general 2020-04-30 03:25:05 you can land an aircraft softly with no land gear
general 2020-04-30 03:29:58 
general 2020-04-30 03:32:02 you could probably do that in a jet
general 2020-04-30 03:32:27 that is actually something you do need
general 2020-04-30 03:32:29 and gliders
general 2020-04-30 03:32:34 they need to be launched
general 2020-04-30 03:32:44 usually from an aircraft with an engine
general 2020-04-30 03:37:49 oh

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 05:45:03 k bye
general 2020-04-30 16:52:58 i would say the gamepass
general 2020-04-30 16:53:12 but now that you mention it
general 2020-04-30 16:53:18 seems stupid you can win the badge
general 2020-04-30 16:53:20 p2w
general 2020-04-30 16:54:33 you can buy them
general 2020-04-30 16:54:46 but i think you should win the badge by participating in the event
general 2020-04-30 16:54:54 not by buying it
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:55:30 he gots the muscles
general 2020-04-30 16:55:49 eh the pontoons are useful
general 2020-04-30 16:55:56 for ship building, and decoration
general 2020-04-30 16:56:06 maybe plane fuselage elements
general 2020-04-30 16:56:56 hey at least rickje is determined to work on his game
general 2020-04-30 16:57:00 unlike madattak
general 2020-04-30 16:57:13 and the game passes do help
general 2020-04-30 16:57:40 he is getting nothing out of them though
general 2020-04-30 16:57:47 if he did not make them
general 2020-04-30 16:58:02 if rickje made them under his account he would get the income
general 2020-04-30 16:58:24 madattak only gets robux from vip servers and premium payouts
general 2020-04-30 16:58:44 the winter event has fireworks and sparklers
general 2020-04-30 16:58:55 that only really helps for decoration
general 2020-04-30 16:59:17 snow blasters is used for decoration and RCS thursters
general 2020-04-30 16:59:33 also none of the images are loading for me
general 2020-04-30 17:00:33 uuh no
general 2020-04-30 17:00:40 almost all of us
general 2020-04-30 17:00:45 got it from the event
general 2020-04-30 17:01:06 you need a rank
general 2020-04-30 17:01:14 then a special channel will open up
general 2020-04-30 17:01:27 that allows you to change your name color
general 2020-04-30 17:01:41 expert?
general 2020-04-30 17:01:48 oof
general 2020-04-30 17:04:17 <#533294912586645521>
general 2020-04-30 17:04:33 ever since the name of that channel was changed
general 2020-04-30 17:04:39 people have been getting confused
general 2020-04-30 17:04:46 and i got confused too
general 2020-04-30 17:04:50 it was rules
general 2020-04-30 17:04:59 but now it has a Q&A section

general 2020-04-30 17:06:15 obc was try hard moderator
general 2020-04-30 17:06:23 now he seems to have calmed down as admin

general 2020-04-30 17:08:48 basically
general 2020-04-30 17:09:56 Puri if quite strict when it comes to channel topics
general 2020-04-30 17:10:26 like he is a little aggressive when it comes to like posting a creation in <#497142796961054721>
general 2020-04-30 17:10:39 or something not related to plane crazy in <#384021699466756107>

general 2020-05-01 05:44:58 such as fuel
general 2020-05-01 05:45:06 imagine if it worked
general 2020-05-01 05:45:16 germany might have won both wars
general 2020-05-01 05:45:35 though technically if they won the first one
general 2020-05-01 05:45:41 there would not be a second one
general 2020-05-01 05:49:17 I just watched a Ho 229 get destroyed by a 2BU2

general 2020-05-01 06:00:46 i did not ask
general 2020-05-01 06:01:11 i need to figure how to not crash replays in war thunder
general 2020-05-01 06:01:18 i really need to use them
general 2020-05-01 06:01:22 to improve my skills
general 2020-05-01 06:01:30 also i keep having funny moments
general 2020-05-01 06:01:45 that are funny

general 2020-05-01 06:02:04 i could
general 2020-05-01 06:02:14 but replays are more efficient
general 2020-05-01 06:02:36 and i dont have to go surfing through hours of footage
general 2020-05-01 06:02:45 or pause a recording after every match
general 2020-05-01 06:02:46 save it
general 2020-05-01 06:02:52 and then start a new one for a new match
general 2020-05-01 06:03:24 okay i need go sleep
general 2020-05-01 06:03:36 i disappear
general 2020-05-01 06:03:42 when i wake up

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 16:28:46 do moderators have the admin permission
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 16:28:54 or are they just allowed in the chat room
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 16:28:56 for no reason
bot-central 2020-05-01 16:29:34 ?whois Purified Water

general 2020-05-01 16:45:57 i see you
general 2020-05-01 16:49:05 i never use autosave
general 2020-05-01 16:49:24 i suggested a change in the autosave feature
general 2020-05-01 16:49:56 where is would save into the last file loaded over whatever interval
general 2020-05-01 16:50:04 until a new save was loaded
general 2020-05-01 16:50:17 or the plot was cleared using the delete aircraft feature
general 2020-05-01 16:50:30 it would remove the autosave file
general 2020-05-01 16:50:40 so you would not have two of the same build
general 2020-05-01 16:50:45 hogging your save data
general 2020-05-01 16:50:57 but rick never noticed
general 2020-05-01 16:52:29 steal her wallet

general 2020-05-01 17:34:21 then a professional landscaper and architect transformed the entirety of the island for free
general 2020-05-01 17:34:28 and built an entire city to go with it

general 2020-05-01 19:53:53 slow internet
general 2020-05-01 19:54:05 dyno did the same
general 2020-05-01 19:55:33 now the funny thing is when it comes to planes
general 2020-05-01 19:55:41 am not noob
general 2020-05-01 19:56:19 minecraft
general 2020-05-01 19:56:43 P-63 is a very good plane
general 2020-05-01 19:56:46 wonderful
general 2020-05-01 19:57:15 P-63 is a good turn fighter
general 2020-05-01 19:57:22 and wonderful at boom and zoom
general 2020-05-01 19:57:40 ew
general 2020-05-01 19:57:42 arcade
general 2020-05-01 19:58:07 P-38 is an interceptor
general 2020-05-01 19:58:23 boom and zoom
general 2020-05-01 19:58:26 no fight
general 2020-05-01 19:58:30 that is how you die
general 2020-05-01 19:58:55 if a plane is bad
general 2020-05-01 19:59:00 you are not using it correctly
general 2020-05-01 19:59:03 as i have found out
general 2020-05-01 19:59:21 no you are just bad <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-05-01 19:59:49 a plane always has its strength
general 2020-05-01 19:59:55 it always excels at something
general 2020-05-01 20:00:20 yeah i said the same for the P-63
general 2020-05-01 20:00:35 i used to absolutely dread the P-63
general 2020-05-01 20:01:01 eh
general 2020-05-01 20:01:12 P-63 is very good at boom and zoom
general 2020-05-01 20:01:20 but it still is a good turn fighter
general 2020-05-01 20:01:32 yes
general 2020-05-01 20:01:37 the USA has those
general 2020-05-01 20:01:57 its 37 mm gun makes it good for anti tank
general 2020-05-01 20:02:09 P-51 is very much a boom and zoom fighter
general 2020-05-01 20:02:13 all models
general 2020-05-01 20:03:10 i find it very good as a turn fighter above 300 km/h
general 2020-05-01 20:03:15 below that is gets iffy
general 2020-05-01 20:04:03 what makes so good in my opinion
general 2020-05-01 20:04:19 is the .50 cals mixed with the 37
general 2020-05-01 20:04:27 the .50 cals for long range
general 2020-05-01 20:04:36 37 for close range cancer
general 2020-05-01 20:04:44 tears everything apart
general 2020-05-01 20:05:28 why are you playing arcade though <@!435946988559925248>
general 2020-05-01 20:05:35 that is half your issue possibly

general 2020-05-01 20:08:39 i stopped playing WoWS
general 2020-05-01 20:09:19 the thing is with the naval tech tree
general 2020-05-01 20:09:30 they would either have to completely redo it for battleships
general 2020-05-01 20:09:43 or they could continue but would have to add modern vehicles
general 2020-05-01 20:09:51 heavy cruisers
general 2020-05-01 20:09:58 which are just light battleships

general 2020-05-01 20:11:24 yeah something like that
general 2020-05-01 20:11:37 but then they would not be used
general 2020-05-01 20:11:41 AI planes suck
general 2020-05-01 20:11:55 also Aircraft carriers would only be good for AFK farming

general 2020-05-03 21:45:52 i can barely do anything
general 2020-05-03 21:46:16 wdym downloading?
general 2020-05-03 21:46:21 you just decided to get it
general 2020-05-03 21:46:37 but yeah im very laggy so i cannot do anything
general 2020-05-03 22:00:45 I know the installation is corrupt
general 2020-05-03 22:00:52 BECAUSE IT LITERALLY ALWAYS IS
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:01:26 Hornets are that one species of insect
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:01:32 that need to go extinct
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:01:53 they are evil bugs
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:01:55 e v i l
general 2020-05-03 22:03:09 also getting an antivirus was a bad idea
general 2020-05-03 22:03:13 cause like literally
general 2020-05-03 22:03:25 the only free one i could find that actually works
general 2020-05-03 22:04:10 just burns out my processor and then asks me to pay 25 dollars for a single tool
general 2020-05-03 22:04:39 it being free is a war crime honestly
general 2020-05-03 22:05:47 see i never installed an antivirus in the first place
general 2020-05-03 22:06:17 macs
general 2020-05-03 22:06:18 suck
general 2020-05-03 22:06:21 i hate macs
general 2020-05-03 22:06:51 i hate apple products
general 2020-05-03 22:07:33 i only got the antivirus because my mom kept saying i should
general 2020-05-03 22:07:56 well i have no money
general 2020-05-03 22:08:02 and my mom will not pay either
general 2020-05-03 22:08:17 i might as well uninstall it
general 2020-05-03 22:08:29 because it does no good
general 2020-05-03 22:08:59 i dont really use google much
general 2020-05-03 22:09:21 im about ready to hurt whoever is in charge of this company
general 2020-05-03 22:11:22 you piece of
general 2020-05-03 22:11:52 IM TRYING TO DELETE IT
general 2020-05-03 22:12:03 what does it mean i need an admin to delete it?
general 2020-05-03 22:12:32 how the heck do you get admin permissions?
general 2020-05-03 22:13:28 <@456226577798135808> how do you get admin permissions
general 2020-05-03 22:13:58 im very sure that is what i did
general 2020-05-03 22:14:38 well there is literally only one account on my computer
general 2020-05-03 22:15:57 yay im stuck with a crappy antivirus that spams notifications at you asking to pay 100 dollars just so i can use up your entire processor
general 2020-05-03 22:16:26 no im having issues with Avast
general 2020-05-03 22:16:41 McAffee only did that too me for maybe a couple months
general 2020-05-03 22:16:44 then is stopped
general 2020-05-03 22:16:56 but it only did that once a month
general 2020-05-03 22:17:07 Avast does it for 10 different tools every 10 minutes
general 2020-05-03 22:17:09 and that
general 2020-05-03 22:17:12 is not all a joke
general 2020-05-03 22:18:37 the account im on is an admin though
general 2020-05-03 22:19:46 okay then
general 2020-05-03 22:19:57 so how do i give myself permission to delete a folder?
general 2020-05-03 22:23:39 nice
general 2020-05-03 22:23:55 i think i just downloading a russian spy program
general 2020-05-03 22:23:59 lovely
general 2020-05-03 22:24:56 because not even an admin can change it
general 2020-05-03 22:27:51 okay so in the menu for the antivirus
general 2020-05-03 22:28:06 i found a setting labeled as "self-defense"
general 2020-05-03 22:28:17 basically it makes it impossible for the folders to be changed
general 2020-05-03 22:28:29 i disabled that and now i get this
general 2020-05-03 22:30:42 i have no idea how i could disable it though
general 2020-05-03 22:32:06 
general 2020-05-03 22:32:11 yeah it is not working
general 2020-05-03 22:39:45 at this point the best way to uninstall it it to throw my computer in a river
general 2020-05-03 22:40:13 and the Mississippi river is only like 15 miles away
general 2020-05-03 22:40:19 which should be good
general 2020-05-03 23:06:52 there was literally an application to uninstall avast
general 2020-05-03 23:07:04 hidden within the files for the program
general 2020-05-03 23:07:54 at least for their browser
general 2020-05-03 23:12:26 downloadable
general 2020-05-03 23:12:27 kill

general 2020-05-04 05:19:18 i wanna know how
general 2020-05-04 05:19:55 the R3 being a wheeled SPAA
general 2020-05-04 05:20:13 is so fast and maneuverable on snow and mud
general 2020-05-04 05:20:16 it does so well
general 2020-05-04 05:20:28 and compared to solid ground and concrete
general 2020-05-04 05:20:37 where it can actually get traction
general 2020-05-04 05:20:44 it like sucks
general 2020-05-04 05:21:37 freaky fast delivery
general 2020-05-04 05:23:48 the R3 was basically an early modern SPAA vehicle
general 2020-05-04 05:23:56 those boxes with gatling guns
general 2020-05-04 05:24:23 its basically the same thing but without a radar
general 2020-05-04 05:32:36 heh
general 2020-05-04 05:32:47 Gaijin took pity on my team
general 2020-05-04 05:32:50 and like
general 2020-05-04 05:33:01 the match ended very very early
general 2020-05-04 05:33:11 before any objective was completed
general 2020-05-04 05:33:58 because we were basically defeated as soon as the first shot was made whether it hit something important or not
general 2020-05-04 05:54:44 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
general 2020-05-04 05:56:01 now if only i could remember how i played the Chaffee that round
general 2020-05-04 05:56:10 then i could bring in stonks
general 2020-05-04 05:56:48 even better if Gaijin would stop killing me every time i use GL boosters
general 2020-05-04 16:13:09 our town is doing our monthly tornado siren testing

general 2020-05-06 05:37:18 The British empire was the greatest for a couple of years
general 2020-05-06 05:37:33 they could not keep together
general 2020-05-06 05:38:22 WWII was a joint effort
general 2020-05-06 05:38:32 WWI was finished by the United States
general 2020-05-06 05:38:39 because everyone else was dead
general 2020-05-06 05:39:48 the Kreigzmarine was weak tbh
general 2020-05-06 05:39:58 and the Luftwaffe was the USA and Britian
general 2020-05-06 05:40:58 uuh yeah
general 2020-05-06 05:41:23 Germany would have conquered Europe without American help
general 2020-05-06 05:41:26 even then they almost won
general 2020-05-06 05:43:05 <@!322970944303923200> even with the United States helping WWII was almost lost
general 2020-05-06 05:43:26 Germany would have taken the European mainland
general 2020-05-06 05:43:30 maybe Britian
general 2020-05-06 05:43:52 go across water
general 2020-05-06 05:44:42 <@!322970944303923200> and the Royal Navy could not get to Germany because of their defenses
general 2020-05-06 05:45:40 <@!322970944303923200> Germany to begin, then Britain for a while, then the USA
general 2020-05-06 05:45:57 the BF 109 was the second most produced aircraft in history
general 2020-05-06 05:46:52 Yeah the American Airforce was the strongest late WWII but never used to its potential
general 2020-05-06 05:46:57 until Cold War
general 2020-05-06 05:47:27 yeah and so was its anti air defenses
general 2020-05-06 05:47:31 smh
general 2020-05-06 05:47:56 no im talking British anti air
general 2020-05-06 05:47:59 nub
general 2020-05-06 05:48:22 Late war Germany was exhausted from the fighting
general 2020-05-06 05:48:30 <@!224513422161739776> no
general 2020-05-06 05:48:34 Flak is anti air
general 2020-05-06 05:49:07 Flak did have anti tank capabilities
general 2020-05-06 05:49:08 yes
general 2020-05-06 05:49:11 penetration
general 2020-05-06 05:49:22 but Flak was anti air
general 2020-05-06 05:49:53 go for the turret ring <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-05-06 05:50:38 just repeatedly bash the hull with hammers until the crew has a bad headache
general 2020-05-06 05:50:47 and cannot fight
general 2020-05-06 05:51:06 the heck is the 7 years war?
general 2020-05-06 05:51:46 France was a defective Britian
general 2020-05-06 05:54:17 can we talk about Finland
general 2020-05-06 05:55:25 <@!351848864531218442> try 20 and a half
general 2020-05-06 05:55:48 M10 is tank destroyer
general 2020-05-06 05:55:52 not a light tank
general 2020-05-06 05:55:53 bruh
general 2020-05-06 05:56:27 what kind of gun did they have?
general 2020-05-06 05:56:34 37mm from 500 meters?
general 2020-05-06 05:56:47 M22
general 2020-05-06 05:57:00 37mm would have burnt you at 2 mm
general 2020-05-06 05:57:08 unless angled enough to bounce the shell
general 2020-05-06 05:57:32 the heck?
general 2020-05-06 05:57:44 the M10 get penned by almost literally everything
general 2020-05-06 05:58:06 Arcade stink
general 2020-05-06 05:58:24 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2020-05-06 05:59:04 M10 is compact boi
general 2020-05-06 06:01:02 <@!351848864531218442> the penetration for AB and RB should be the same
general 2020-05-06 06:01:14 and so should armor
general 2020-05-06 06:01:28 yes but at what angle?
general 2020-05-06 06:02:10 bruh you must have been fighting a new player
general 2020-05-06 06:02:27 that does not understand that War Thunder is not a health based game
general 2020-05-06 06:02:38 so you actually need to aim
general 2020-05-06 06:03:04 Chaffee can pen quite a bit of things
general 2020-05-06 06:03:14 but gets penned easily in return
general 2020-05-06 06:03:47 a good hit on any tank of its BR and actually above
general 2020-05-06 06:03:52 will usually go kaboom
general 2020-05-06 06:04:48 I pounced on a Panzer, somehow hit the barrel and broke it
general 2020-05-06 06:04:54 i could have hit the entire tank
general 2020-05-06 06:04:58 instead i hit the barrel
general 2020-05-06 06:05:05 he panicked and backed up
general 2020-05-06 06:05:13 then got hit by a stray shot and died
general 2020-05-06 06:05:36 They are small
general 2020-05-06 06:05:41 and hard to aim at
general 2020-05-06 06:05:59 there are better places to aim unless the Sherman is distracted and not looking at you
general 2020-05-06 06:06:07 then you can easily aim for the weak spots
general 2020-05-06 06:06:44 the Hull gun or the driver and machine gunner optics
general 2020-05-06 06:06:50 its like popping a pimple
general 2020-05-06 06:07:13 the optics would be easier to hit
general 2020-05-06 06:07:37 most people will bring max ammo too
general 2020-05-06 06:07:42 which never helps
general 2020-05-06 06:07:48 more chances to get ammo racked
general 2020-05-06 06:08:04 and makes you heavier thus less maneuverable
general 2020-05-06 06:08:35 yes
general 2020-05-06 06:09:19 and the M4 Sherman and below has these additional plates over the ammo racks
general 2020-05-06 06:09:25 however 20-30 rounds
general 2020-05-06 06:09:29 which i usually bring
general 2020-05-06 06:09:38 will just put them at the bottom the tank
general 2020-05-06 06:09:54 where a luck splash shot could set them up
general 2020-05-06 06:10:05 but that takes a big gun to get the splash damage
general 2020-05-06 06:10:11 from an HE round
general 2020-05-06 06:10:36 okay imma go commit slep
general 2020-05-06 06:10:53 also if you commit RB
general 2020-05-06 06:11:04 watch out for when the Soviets play with the Germans
general 2020-05-06 06:11:26 You are more likely to loose, then Clorox killing all the germs
general 2020-05-06 06:11:33 no it does not
general 2020-05-06 06:11:48 however it is best to keep aviation research balanced with tanks
general 2020-05-06 06:11:52 close BRs
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 16:26:23 The treads with no tank
general 2020-05-06 17:29:14 <@!495822777224396811> actually im in your vip rn
general 2020-05-06 22:55:59 <@!351848864531218442> Yeah advertisements will show based on what your internet activity
general 2020-05-06 22:56:23 so google will show you War Thunder ads if you watch, play, or hack War Thunder
general 2020-05-06 22:58:30 Comrade Stalin versus one Argentinian rancher
general 2020-05-06 23:00:32 even bigger bruh moment
general 2020-05-06 23:02:26 Dyno likes to warn for spamming
general 2020-05-06 23:02:31 if you send like one message
general 2020-05-06 23:02:38 like you could just be typing a sentance
general 2020-05-06 23:02:49 and Dyno will be "never"
general 2020-05-06 23:02:57 yes
general 2020-05-06 23:03:16 imagine if enough people spammed enough
general 2020-05-06 23:03:25 that the bot was forced to warn itself
general 2020-05-06 23:03:56 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
general 2020-05-06 23:04:11 also i was Communist boi
general 2020-05-06 23:04:15 not sticky democracy
general 2020-05-06 23:04:26 tax income is not a priority
general 2020-05-06 23:04:33 sticky stinky
general 2020-05-06 23:04:45 hmm
general 2020-05-06 23:04:58 weak
general 2020-05-06 23:05:10 somewhere there is a picture
general 2020-05-06 23:05:17 where i was so strong
general 2020-05-06 23:05:27 that no countries showed up on the rankings
general 2020-05-06 23:05:41 oh i left the game
general 2020-05-06 23:05:49 also i have to go digging in my pictures
general 2020-05-06 23:06:07 also also i have to go now
general 2020-05-06 23:06:16 hence why i left the game
general 2020-05-06 23:06:53 that is assuming you can not break in the process
general 2020-05-06 23:07:00 because Europe is like
general 2020-05-06 23:07:01 akdofhoakfhdspoh
general 2020-05-06 23:07:31 though then again i nearly took over the world with Brazil and democracy
general 2020-05-06 23:07:34 if i had time too
general 2020-05-06 23:07:37 i would have
general 2020-05-06 23:07:52 no
general 2020-05-06 23:07:56 the flags are preset
general 2020-05-06 23:08:42 Brazil is democratic, which means you can hardly take over two countries without them declaring independance
general 2020-05-06 23:08:58 or any other country you had conquered previously

general 2020-05-07 05:53:03 <@!252094891448860673> Something on Dyno broke so anyone with either Designer IV or VTOL Engineer II can ban people

general 2020-05-07 20:16:52 and never got WoT
general 2020-05-07 20:17:29 and actually penning tougher targets
general 2020-05-07 20:17:52 you need to know where to aim to get a good hit when it comes to heavily armoured targets
general 2020-05-07 20:19:21 but you still should know weak spots
general 2020-05-07 20:19:25 so you can do more damage
general 2020-05-07 20:19:26 kill
general 2020-05-07 20:19:31 or even pen in some cases
general 2020-05-07 20:19:48 cause some shells and guns will not pen a target at any angle or range

general 2020-05-07 21:42:31 i knew this would happen
general 2020-05-07 21:42:39 as soon as the name was changed
general 2020-05-07 21:42:45 that people would not read the rules
general 2020-05-07 21:42:50 and it would cause issues
general 2020-05-07 21:43:01 i even made a suggestion
general 2020-05-07 21:43:12 saying the name should be changed back because of this issue
general 2020-05-07 21:43:27 i guess that works
general 2020-05-07 21:44:36 yes
general 2020-05-07 21:44:43 scare away the undes
general 2020-05-07 21:44:55 <:wot:695654208837255219>

general 2020-05-07 21:45:46 where you had to read the rules first to get in

general 2020-05-07 21:55:46 no
general 2020-05-07 21:57:36 i expect him to drive out all the low and middle class citizens and send them either homeless or a trash apartment with the building he wants to built as part of the space force in Colorado Springs

plane-crazy 2020-05-07 22:25:26 Bait?
general 2020-05-07 22:42:39 i just sent an AP round (because stock torture <:pain:644301805534183464>) straight through the fuselage of a plane and out the back
general 2020-05-07 22:43:03 and it only took the flaps off
general 2020-05-07 22:43:11 then he crashed
general 2020-05-07 22:51:34 also i tried to shoot an aircraft down before it would kill me as an AA
general 2020-05-07 22:51:41 but all the rounds
general 2020-05-07 22:51:55 went no where near the vicinity of the aircraft
general 2020-05-07 23:07:25 yay
general 2020-05-07 23:07:30 i had to fight an entire round
general 2020-05-07 23:07:32 with literally
general 2020-05-07 23:07:34 999 ping
general 2020-05-07 23:07:49 i literally could not do anything
general 2020-05-07 23:07:59 every single shot did nothing
general 2020-05-07 23:08:05 i could not move without teleporting
general 2020-05-07 23:08:36 and all the enemies were also teleporting for me so it made it hard to actually hit anything
general 2020-05-07 23:08:55 except aircraft cause for some reason they did not appear to be affected
general 2020-05-07 23:09:13 fun times

general 2020-05-08 03:02:30 its a lego box with a waterwheel <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-05-08 03:08:48 i can do that too
general 2020-05-08 03:09:31 then i can do this
general 2020-05-08 03:15:38 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
general 2020-05-08 03:16:15 squish
general 2020-05-08 03:59:05 no its a joke
general 2020-05-08 04:13:08 Why do i keep getting all the gay maps
general 2020-05-08 04:13:16 literally
general 2020-05-08 04:13:27 that is the third map in a row
general 2020-05-08 04:13:31 the same map
general 2020-05-08 04:13:34 3 times in a row
general 2020-05-08 04:13:52 im getting none of the good maps
general 2020-05-08 04:14:05 and i always have to verse the germans and soviets
general 2020-05-08 04:14:19 which are literally the most overpowered combination
general 2020-05-08 04:14:24 also i cannot see streams
general 2020-05-08 04:14:30 for whatever reasons
general 2020-05-08 04:16:55 my voice is more dad
general 2020-05-08 04:31:17 i just got my wing torn off and my plane set on fire by a wirbelwind shell from 3 kilometers away
general 2020-05-08 05:42:35 wtf
general 2020-05-08 05:42:39 how is it possible
general 2020-05-08 05:42:47 i am being farmed like corn
general 2020-05-08 05:42:57 in air, ground, and naval RB
general 2020-05-08 05:43:07 this can no longer be skill determined
general 2020-05-08 05:44:00 especially naval
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:46:56 well you take a motor
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:46:59 and you lock it
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:47:04 in the settings
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:47:28 no keep powered on
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:47:44 a un-powered motor is just a hinge
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:49:39 uh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:49:44 you enable motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:49:48 in the setttings
general 2020-05-08 05:57:55 i seriously dont understand
general 2020-05-08 05:57:59 maybe it is true
general 2020-05-08 05:58:11 Gaijin is purposely trying to get me killed all the time
general 2020-05-08 05:58:19 i said that as a joke previously
general 2020-05-08 05:58:24 but now it actually seems true
general 2020-05-08 06:30:50 ew RNG
general 2020-05-08 06:30:58 realism is good
general 2020-05-08 06:31:21 rng is for noobs
general 2020-05-08 06:31:34 in that since not realistic
general 2020-05-08 06:31:52 but physics is about as real as posible
general 2020-05-08 06:31:59 for a video game
general 2020-05-08 06:32:05 and shooting mechanics
general 2020-05-08 06:32:17 and damage
general 2020-05-08 06:33:02 i dont like WoWS
general 2020-05-08 06:33:13 because it is not really skill based
general 2020-05-08 06:33:19 it is literally just shoot
general 2020-05-08 06:34:03 i dont like War Gaming more then Gaijin
general 2020-05-08 06:34:19 Gaijin puts more into their game
general 2020-05-08 06:34:31 regardless the fact they dont care about their community
general 2020-05-08 06:34:56 also i would rather be bad because of skill
general 2020-05-08 06:34:58 and not just luck
general 2020-05-08 06:35:53 rng for me is just 50-50
general 2020-05-08 06:35:56 some days im unluck
general 2020-05-08 06:36:07 others i am very lucky
general 2020-05-08 06:36:37 if you thinks its point and shoot
general 2020-05-08 06:36:43 stop watching so much youtube
general 2020-05-08 06:37:04 who usually will only show their best kills
general 2020-05-08 06:37:41 yeah and
general 2020-05-08 06:37:49 war thunder is literally not just point and shoot
general 2020-05-08 06:38:06 except maybe high tiers
general 2020-05-08 06:38:25 if you get through armor and into an ammo rack
general 2020-05-08 06:39:00 that is if you pen
general 2020-05-08 06:39:33 wot has a health system i assume
general 2020-05-08 06:39:39 because WG
general 2020-05-08 06:40:00 ?
general 2020-05-08 06:41:19 unless arcade noob
general 2020-05-08 06:41:30 then war thunder points you to the target
general 2020-05-08 06:41:40 basically
general 2020-05-08 06:42:00 arcade is just fancy laser tag in my opinion
general 2020-05-08 06:42:46 more cluttered?
general 2020-05-08 06:43:23 wdym less space?
general 2020-05-08 06:43:42 that is usually what happens when you zoom in
general 2020-05-08 06:44:18 that does not bother me
general 2020-05-08 06:44:28 except when aiming at a small, distant target
general 2020-05-08 06:44:47 yeah you are the first person to complain about the stock sights
general 2020-05-08 06:44:58 with the black lines
general 2020-05-08 06:45:46 uuh yeah
general 2020-05-08 06:45:51 saying it is too cluttered
general 2020-05-08 06:45:57 
general 2020-05-08 06:46:36 details do help
general 2020-05-08 06:46:41 when trying to explain something
general 2020-05-08 06:47:18 it did sound like you were complaining about lines
general 2020-05-08 06:47:30 that are supposed to help aim
general 2020-05-08 06:48:29 that is not a sight
general 2020-05-08 06:48:34 that is a hazard
general 2020-05-08 06:48:49 *fragmentation intensifies*
general 2020-05-08 06:49:22 i dont know how the Kv-2 was used
general 2020-05-08 06:50:32 Gaijin is a big company that produces high quality games and sells them for $0.00 with no taxes
general 2020-05-08 06:50:50 so yeah premiums for days so they can not go bankrupt
general 2020-05-08 06:51:17 no idea what shilling means
general 2020-05-08 06:52:14 uuh no im not shilling
general 2020-05-08 06:52:45 if i was then whoever run Gaijin is very drunk
general 2020-05-08 06:52:59 well actually that would not be surprising
general 2020-05-08 06:53:14 since Gaijin bruhsian company
general 2020-05-08 06:54:13 Shermans will bounce almost every shell of its hulls
general 2020-05-08 06:54:42 yes
general 2020-05-08 06:54:43 yes
general 2020-05-08 06:54:45 and yes
general 2020-05-08 06:55:01 i know shermans weaknesses
general 2020-05-08 06:55:21 everything but the upper front glacis
general 2020-05-08 06:55:28 and if the side is angled
general 2020-05-08 06:55:40 M10 is good sniper
general 2020-05-08 06:55:46 good pen
general 2020-05-08 06:55:51 but like no armor
general 2020-05-08 06:55:58 and the worst turret possible
general 2020-05-08 06:56:50 i nearly killed an entire team by spawn camping in an M10
general 2020-05-08 06:57:18 until this one AA truck traveled the entire perimeter of the map just to get me
general 2020-05-08 06:58:13 actually he soviets were are allies
general 2020-05-08 06:58:17 surprisingly
general 2020-05-08 06:58:39 like 1/10 rounds the americans will have the soviets
general 2020-05-08 06:58:54 hence my my V/B ratio is so low
general 2020-05-08 06:59:21 because when Germany and the Soviet Union are paired together
general 2020-05-08 06:59:44 you only win either by them being bad
general 2020-05-08 06:59:56 or
general 2020-05-08 07:00:03 by not even fighting in the first place
general 2020-05-08 07:00:13 no but you will still loose
general 2020-05-08 07:00:18 it does not matter most the time
general 2020-05-08 07:00:35 germany and russia together is just the worst
general 2020-05-08 07:01:09 no idea what it even happens
general 2020-05-08 07:01:30 germany has some very nice tanks
general 2020-05-08 07:01:56 when you have the standard allies versus axis powers
general 2020-05-08 07:02:02 it could go either way
general 2020-05-08 07:02:21 but when germany has russia your best bet is to just leave the match
general 2020-05-08 07:02:32 maybe banzai
general 2020-05-08 07:02:50 if your bank is not the important to you
general 2020-05-08 07:03:38 i really need to get replays to work for me
general 2020-05-08 07:04:17 wot does not have more vehicles
general 2020-05-08 07:04:49 yeah war thunder is a bit grindy
general 2020-05-08 07:05:12 especially if your like me that cannot figure out what he is doing wrong to save his life
general 2020-05-08 07:05:14 literally
general 2020-05-08 07:05:23 hence why i need to get replays to work
general 2020-05-08 07:05:37 so i can figure out why i am doing so horrible
general 2020-05-08 07:05:53 haha
general 2020-05-08 07:06:25 hey at least you dont need to unlock the P-51 and then buy it
general 2020-05-08 07:06:43 wtf
general 2020-05-08 07:07:12 what did you do to that spitfire <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
general 2020-05-08 07:08:33 im still trying to figure out what happened to that spitfire
general 2020-05-08 07:08:47 also why the wing frames are rendered
general 2020-05-08 07:09:11 okay i should sleep
general 2020-05-08 07:09:23 im not going to wake up tomorrow at this point
general 2020-05-08 07:09:30 so i would rather wake up the next day
general 2020-05-08 07:09:45 yes

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 03:59:03 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:08 depends on who you ask really
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:19 even though it measures to be 2x2x2 studs
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:37 you get so many other answers its hard to be sure
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:42 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:52 2x2x2 studs
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:00:58 bloc measurement
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 04:27:56 nice
general 2020-05-09 04:28:49 when are you people going to learn that looking at me is not a good idea
general 2020-05-09 04:30:59 
the-dump 2020-05-09 04:31:30 👀
general 2020-05-09 04:32:29 the face makes a good emoji for like if somebody posts a gruesomely bad creation
general 2020-05-09 16:45:03 <@!537285695128076288> the rails have to be big so that you can build detailed trains
general 2020-05-09 16:45:28 otherwise you would literally be building a box with wheels
general 2020-05-09 16:46:12 it would be like cheap model train details
general 2020-05-09 16:46:24 and not realistically looking
general 2020-05-09 16:50:52 build the locomotive to scale on the small tracks you made <@!537285695128076288>
general 2020-05-09 16:51:10 then should you should try on the in game ones to scale
general 2020-05-09 16:52:27 it would be nice if you had something like wall panels
general 2020-05-09 16:53:13 like wings but the are centered on two blocks and the hitbox dont interact with most blocks
general 2020-05-09 16:53:21 such as seats
general 2020-05-09 16:53:31 then it would work for the small tracks
general 2020-05-09 16:53:58 or maybe use wings if there is a train wide enough
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 16:54:23 <@!349574733945241602> what are you trying to make?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:01:37 what is day

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:01:52 what server

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:02:31 do you have an issue with stream sniping?
general 2020-05-09 17:10:38 Darkz got banned?
general 2020-05-09 17:11:24 not much detail
general 2020-05-09 17:11:38 and does it stay on the tracks?
general 2020-05-09 17:13:34 3 blocks it looks like
general 2020-05-09 17:14:19 i have the same question
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:16:35 <@!448505589983739914> you sure those are old pictures?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:17:13 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>

general 2020-05-09 18:56:44 because unde
general 2020-05-09 19:04:41 rick is capitalizing on their stupidity and to possibly prevent others from playing stupidly loud music
general 2020-05-09 19:04:44 or sound effects
general 2020-05-09 19:05:04 oh no
general 2020-05-09 19:07:00 damnit PewDiePie
general 2020-05-09 19:07:43 i cant tell if he is in arcade or realistic
general 2020-05-09 19:08:19 but either way all those PewDie followers will just leave the game as soon as they play
general 2020-05-09 19:08:27 if not hopefully they stay in Arcade
general 2020-05-09 19:09:07 the repair costs are not that big an issue if you get enough from a round
general 2020-05-09 19:09:20 if you are good enough
general 2020-05-09 19:09:28 or if you have social anxiety
general 2020-05-09 19:09:36 hmm yes
general 2020-05-09 19:09:44 its called Naval forces
general 2020-05-09 19:10:20 Naval RB needs to be more like Ground RB
general 2020-05-09 19:10:50 naval battles you cannot use your own aircraft
general 2020-05-09 19:11:07 the game chooses one from a preset lineup
general 2020-05-09 19:11:39 and if you have one of the vehicles it just uses what you have already set
general 2020-05-09 19:13:07 <@!177743269105500160>wdym?
general 2020-05-09 19:13:42 arcade or realistic
general 2020-05-09 19:15:10 <@!177743269105500160> yeah that is kinda what happens with stock vehicles
general 2020-05-09 19:15:17 but you are still a noob for quiting a game
general 2020-05-09 19:15:25 because of a stupid mistake
general 2020-05-09 19:19:16 it is a code
general 2020-05-09 19:19:20 for the name
general 2020-05-09 19:19:52 it is not the actual name, it is a sekrit code for the name
general 2020-05-09 19:20:45 no just send him to my school
general 2020-05-09 19:20:57 because we do not have a bullying issue somehow
general 2020-05-09 19:21:03 except in the elemetary
general 2020-05-09 19:21:12 where everyone legit tries to murder each other
general 2020-05-09 19:50:20 not if you dont buy premium vehicles
general 2020-05-09 20:06:20 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-05-09 20:06:24 ban time
general 2020-05-09 20:07:01 i like how most people do not realize
general 2020-05-09 20:07:36 that posting that stuff is not allowed
general 2020-05-09 20:07:52 even if they are reporting it
general 2020-05-09 20:08:00 <#623337136267067393> is where you show it
general 2020-05-09 20:08:16 haha get lagged

general 2020-05-09 20:09:29 so why would you say it?

general 2020-05-09 20:10:04 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2020-05-09 20:37:47 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 20:40:00 except the weld point is on the back
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 20:40:15 instead of all around
general 2020-05-09 20:48:56 why do all those games have backup generators
general 2020-05-09 20:49:01 do the devs not realize
general 2020-05-09 20:49:12 there is such thing as a breaker box
general 2020-05-09 20:49:23 and you could just have that trip and send someone to fix it
general 2020-05-09 20:49:54 or just say it was a power failure due to some plant malfunction or something
general 2020-05-09 20:50:26 because honestly who has a backup electric generator to power their house?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 20:50:53 F4 Phantom moment
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 20:56:01 how come the F4 Phantom has become a common build after the Vietnam War contest
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 21:05:53 the what?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 21:06:09 <@!537271441712742411> wdym
general 2020-05-09 21:22:44 yep German aircraft are still OP
general 2020-05-09 21:32:50 how does one grind the american aircraft tech tree
general 2020-05-09 21:33:02 in war thunder
general 2020-05-09 21:33:07 most the aircraft
general 2020-05-09 21:33:12 especially rank 3 and 4
general 2020-05-09 21:33:18 and boom and zoom
general 2020-05-09 21:33:23 not dogfighters
general 2020-05-09 21:33:38 like literally every aircraft of every other nation
general 2020-05-09 21:33:55 the problem is climb rate
general 2020-05-09 21:34:01 its not the best
general 2020-05-09 21:34:13 and the Germans have overperforming aircraft
general 2020-05-09 21:34:19 here is the thing
general 2020-05-09 21:34:23 that is what i do
general 2020-05-09 21:34:26 boom and zoom
general 2020-05-09 21:34:34 where does it get he?
general 2020-05-09 21:34:42 nowhere but the hanger
general 2020-05-09 21:34:55 because you get outclimbed by almost everyone else
general 2020-05-09 21:35:08 actually
general 2020-05-09 21:35:12 i never have played japanese
general 2020-05-09 21:35:18 so kek
general 2020-05-09 21:36:29 
general 2020-05-09 21:36:42 i have been doing all it says
general 2020-05-09 21:36:44 in the wiki
general 2020-05-09 21:36:46 naturally
general 2020-05-09 21:37:08 i have only just looked at the wiki for the aircraft im having troubles
general 2020-05-09 21:37:20 i would imagine americans being excellent late game aircraft
general 2020-05-09 21:37:33 but late game everyone is at low altitudes
general 2020-05-09 21:37:42 so you have just wasted the time climbing
general 2020-05-09 21:37:51 because you are so high up
general 2020-05-09 21:38:02 diving becomes risky unless it is shallow
general 2020-05-09 21:38:13 though you could just stay level
general 2020-05-09 21:38:26 changing altitude as the game changes
general 2020-05-09 21:38:42 but you have to worry about overspeeding
general 2020-05-09 21:39:17 only for dive bombers and a few fighters
general 2020-05-09 21:39:36 you noobs most aircraft dont have airbrakes
general 2020-05-09 21:40:08 well at this point i have lost hope in you
general 2020-05-09 21:40:16 since i have been doing all you say to do
general 2020-05-09 21:40:22 and you keep calling me noobs
general 2020-05-09 21:40:33 and then saying i dont know how to deploy airbrakes
general 2020-05-09 21:41:20 americans dont have dogfighters
general 2020-05-09 21:41:27 so evading is difficult
general 2020-05-09 21:41:43 well actually P-63 is a good dogfighter
general 2020-05-09 21:41:53 <@!224513422161739776> what do you think im doing nerd
general 2020-05-09 21:42:26 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
general 2020-05-09 21:42:37 yes i have no brain
general 2020-05-09 21:42:48 american fighters are best dogfighters
general 2020-05-09 21:42:50 1000%
general 2020-05-09 21:42:52 amazing
general 2020-05-09 21:42:56 spitfires are noobs
general 2020-05-09 21:43:19 since when did russia design german aircraft?

general 2020-05-09 22:13:25 so yeah

general 2020-05-09 22:14:39 except for American cars and planes
general 2020-05-09 22:14:48 those are pretty good

general 2020-05-10 03:50:09 i assume madattak is just being silly
general 2020-05-10 04:18:51 if James really needs help he should be able to

general 2020-05-10 05:09:24 then a new virus was discovered in China
general 2020-05-10 05:09:39 then it evolved into a pandemic

general 2020-05-10 06:32:43 it was a joke
general 2020-05-10 06:33:14 but some say copyright from Disney because there was a shortfilm made by Disney called "Plane Crazy"

general 2020-05-10 21:46:29 oh Gaijin your AI is incredible
general 2020-05-10 21:48:23 all those aircraft waiting for that glitched I-16
general 2020-05-10 21:59:37 bombing in RB is not worth it unless you carpet bomb troops
general 2020-05-10 21:59:52 such as tanks, SPAA, and armored cars
general 2020-05-10 22:04:19 if you can B-29 troops it will be worth it because they, medium tanks especially, have the highest return for Lions and RP
general 2020-05-10 22:04:28 and it does not take much
general 2020-05-10 22:18:27 targets are not good at moving in straight lines though
general 2020-05-10 22:18:50 they often take turns and such
general 2020-05-10 22:19:16 the B-25 would be good as it was built for that
general 2020-05-10 22:19:19 frontline bomber
general 2020-05-10 22:19:33 low altitude carpet bombing
general 2020-05-10 22:19:40 yes they do
general 2020-05-10 22:19:46 but there are so many roads
general 2020-05-10 22:19:55 and sometimes they dont even use roads
general 2020-05-10 22:20:07 they will just go straight into a field
general 2020-05-10 22:20:47 by default the B-29 has a repair cost of 38000 lions though
general 2020-05-10 22:20:53 because Gaijin
general 2020-05-10 22:20:55 are
general 2020-05-10 22:21:00 straight up idiots
general 2020-05-10 22:21:18 by default 4 m/s
general 2020-05-10 22:21:25 im not sure upgraded
general 2020-05-10 22:21:57 i pounced a pancake once
general 2020-05-10 22:22:00 and all i hit
general 2020-05-10 22:22:05 was the gun barrel
general 2020-05-10 22:22:11 out of the entire tank
general 2020-05-10 22:22:14 the gun barrel
general 2020-05-10 22:22:41 T-34 side armor
general 2020-05-10 22:22:55 americans struggle to pen the front armor
general 2020-05-10 22:22:59 but the side armor
general 2020-05-10 22:23:04 smooth as butter
general 2020-05-10 22:24:01 Shermans are good tanks
general 2020-05-10 22:24:07 as long as you know how to use them
general 2020-05-10 22:25:23 
general 2020-05-10 22:25:59 T-34 but its armor is driver ports
general 2020-05-10 22:26:30 optics are best armor
general 2020-05-10 22:26:32 change my mind
general 2020-05-10 22:29:25 
general 2020-05-10 22:29:44 its just a hole
general 2020-05-10 22:30:43 but it also has some optics
general 2020-05-10 22:31:23 RIP engine 1
general 2020-05-10 22:32:05 in air battles with manual engine control enabled
general 2020-05-10 22:32:33 i can control each engine using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
general 2020-05-10 22:33:04 instead of using separate caliber control
general 2020-05-10 22:33:24 its good in air RB when an engine catches on fire
general 2020-05-10 22:33:30 you can just disable control for the rest
general 2020-05-10 22:33:36 and turn off that one engine
general 2020-05-10 22:33:43 and the fire should go out eventually
general 2020-05-10 22:34:04 also some planes are equipped with fire extinguishers that you can use
general 2020-05-10 22:34:17 so if something catches on fire just use that
general 2020-05-10 22:34:29 if it does not work then banzai

general 2020-05-10 22:57:18 also im hearing a lot of people say that you should grind modifications in arcade
general 2020-05-10 22:57:21 but like
general 2020-05-10 22:57:25 you get almost no RP
general 2020-05-10 22:57:30 as compared to RB
general 2020-05-10 22:58:09 its pretty much the same but without as much repair costs
general 2020-05-10 22:58:49 i wonder how war thunder would handle battleships
general 2020-05-10 22:58:58 cause rn ships only go to BR 5.7
general 2020-05-10 22:59:05 to avoid jet confrontation
general 2020-05-10 22:59:10 because of AA guns
general 2020-05-10 22:59:27 well aircraft and naval battles are not a good mix
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 03:33:30 i think so
general 2020-05-11 03:51:45 yes
general 2020-05-11 03:51:55 even though i have only gotten a couple
general 2020-05-11 03:52:58 i got 1000 less in air AB for destroying 3 aircraft
general 2020-05-11 03:53:10 in this i only got one hit
general 2020-05-11 04:13:53 how the heck
general 2020-05-11 04:14:07 i just
general 2020-05-11 04:14:10 what
general 2020-05-11 04:14:44 how the when what where why
general 2020-05-11 04:15:00 i swear any time i get near the ground
general 2020-05-11 04:15:05 it literally just pulls me in
general 2020-05-11 04:15:07 and i die
general 2020-05-11 04:17:09 why is all the games i love have become so bad
general 2020-05-11 04:26:54 imma see if turning my graphics down will help
general 2020-05-11 04:27:01 im not sure it will but worth a shot
general 2020-05-11 04:36:42 i just witness a pentouple kamikaze
general 2020-05-11 04:36:50 i was being chased by one dude
general 2020-05-11 04:37:26 this other guy came in to save me being trailed by someone else
general 2020-05-11 04:37:37 then two of my teammate came to help him
general 2020-05-11 04:37:52 and it all coalesced into a big ball of sadness
general 2020-05-11 04:38:15 then i got shot down because Corsairs
general 2020-05-11 04:38:29 pretty much suck
general 2020-05-11 04:39:14 too heavy, too slow, poor maneuverability, poor climb rate
general 2020-05-11 04:39:26 good armament and dive characteristics
general 2020-05-11 04:39:36 but like
general 2020-05-11 04:39:39 that is all that is good
general 2020-05-11 04:40:07 its a good boom and zoom fighter but you need to get the enemy or just severely damage them
general 2020-05-11 04:40:19 else you are going to die
general 2020-05-11 04:41:08 <@!224513422161739776> no
general 2020-05-11 04:41:36 for american fighters they have arguably the worst suspended armament
general 2020-05-11 04:41:45 or at least the weakest
general 2020-05-11 04:44:11 
general 2020-05-11 04:44:24 i have not seen one single
general 2020-05-11 04:44:28 japanese aircraft
general 2020-05-11 04:44:41 in the F4U-1C
general 2020-05-11 04:45:27 fight me Gajin
general 2020-05-11 04:45:35 take a biplane and see who wins
general 2020-05-11 04:49:31 <:Wack:559530123284578326>
general 2020-05-11 04:50:09 wait the wiki shows no limit to the gears <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-05-11 04:52:08 wait what the heck
general 2020-05-11 04:52:21 im climbing at 10 degrees in the test flight
general 2020-05-11 04:52:25 and gaining speed
general 2020-05-11 04:52:52 i can barely fly above a 7 degree climb and not loose airspeed
general 2020-05-11 04:53:35 you have to raid the pentagon
general 2020-05-11 04:53:40 and steal a special tool
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 04:54:53 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-11 04:55:54 
general 2020-05-11 04:56:06 excuse gayjin
general 2020-05-11 04:56:08 but
general 2020-05-11 04:56:11 what???
general 2020-05-11 04:57:38 hold on i need to higher
general 2020-05-11 04:57:41 straight dive
general 2020-05-11 05:01:11 oh now you break
general 2020-05-11 05:05:55 okay screw Corsair imma just use my KIngcobra and get the P-38 that can actually do more
general 2020-05-11 05:07:06 that honestly felt weird going by the aircraft's nicknames instead of their model designations
general 2020-05-11 05:07:14 thingies
general 2020-05-11 05:10:25 why is the F4U-1C a B&Z fighter whilst the F4U-4 is just a fighter
general 2020-05-11 05:10:29 decent at both
general 2020-05-11 05:11:44 also why did they just mention the issue with yawing when doing high speed diving 4 aircraft after the issue was discovered
general 2020-05-11 05:13:18 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 05:22:58 wait why would you need to buy the gamepass in the test sewer
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 05:23:35 hardcore capitalists
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 05:23:57 nah not even soviet russia could afford speaker
general 2020-05-11 05:27:35 13 days free repair time
general 2020-05-11 05:29:43 ask gaijin and their drunkin, not at all thought out, stupid ideas
general 2020-05-11 06:01:08 when i say german aircraft are overpowered in war thunder
general 2020-05-11 06:01:17 when anyone says german aircraft are overpowered
general 2020-05-11 06:01:44 take their word because they speak more truth then we actually breath oxygen
general 2020-05-11 06:01:49 i cant even paly
general 2020-05-11 06:02:00 i cant even play war thunder anymore
general 2020-05-11 06:02:47 i have gone sooooo many rounds
general 2020-05-11 06:02:51 without getting any kills
general 2020-05-11 06:02:55 except myself
general 2020-05-11 06:03:14 yes
general 2020-05-11 06:03:26 disable your engine and just crash and burn
general 2020-05-11 06:03:29 that is best way
general 2020-05-11 06:03:51 but yeah i cannot even get through the american tech tree anymore
general 2020-05-11 06:03:59 i am making literally no progress
general 2020-05-11 06:04:20 despite how hard im trying
general 2020-05-11 06:04:59 it is no longer skill based anymore to be all honest
general 2020-05-11 06:05:04 it is just straight up
general 2020-05-11 06:05:17 the specs of the aircraft
general 2020-05-11 06:07:20 i cannot even load the war thunder forum to at least figure how to deal with german aircraft effectively
general 2020-05-11 06:07:28 or figure out if im doing anything wrong
general 2020-05-11 06:08:07 war thunder does not have a discord server
general 2020-05-11 06:08:17 which they honestly should
general 2020-05-11 06:09:00 that is basically the r3 t20
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 06:12:11 search it up
the-dump 2020-05-11 14:52:57 this is what i wake up to

general 2020-05-11 15:35:07 to keep the aircraft level
general 2020-05-11 15:35:45 i have done it many times
general 2020-05-11 15:36:06 im bad at a lot of things except landing critically damage aircraft
general 2020-05-11 15:55:32 i just crashed

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:33:46 you really do not get much from speakers unless you have good sound ids
general 2020-05-11 18:34:08 hover engine idea is kind of old
general 2020-05-11 18:34:24 conveyor engines are the go to engine
general 2020-05-11 18:34:36 since it is more efficient
general 2020-05-11 18:34:45 better control
general 2020-05-11 18:34:59 and supposedly less glitchy
general 2020-05-11 18:35:16 <@456226577798135808> then why did you make a video about them?
general 2020-05-11 18:35:32 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2020-05-11 18:38:24 <@!500443537389912074> if he is in the US he cannot
general 2020-05-11 18:38:38 since he is still a minor
general 2020-05-11 18:38:48 he could do volunteer work
general 2020-05-11 18:38:52 but that usually does not pay
general 2020-05-11 18:39:40 my dad was going to get me a job for summer
general 2020-05-11 18:39:43 but i was like nah
general 2020-05-11 18:39:49 imma volunteer at the zoo

general 2020-05-11 18:40:48 the best way to make a vegan not a vegan is to make them join the military
general 2020-05-11 18:41:02 everyone says the vegan MREs are death in a bag

general 2020-05-11 18:41:56 i only upvoted 4 trash videos
general 2020-05-11 18:42:01 and then forgot about it
general 2020-05-11 18:42:21 it did not help that OBS studio does not work for some reason
general 2020-05-11 18:42:25 i could just uninstall it
general 2020-05-11 18:42:28 and reinstall

general 2020-05-11 21:41:18 this is why you never use boosters
general 2020-05-11 21:41:32 that is usually what happens
general 2020-05-11 21:41:37 if you do
general 2020-05-11 21:43:14 no its because i used a 300% lions booster
general 2020-05-11 21:43:25 if i use any booster that is what usually happens
general 2020-05-11 21:44:36 that is almost every match
general 2020-05-11 22:02:13 did gaijin decide to incorporate lineup sizes in matchmaking?
general 2020-05-11 22:02:19 because my team keeps dying

plane-crazy 2020-05-12 03:40:11 how i did not forget about it in the first place is a mystery however
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 03:45:40 im too smart for even myself
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 03:46:58 i cannot figure out how to make the fold because my intelligence is too high for me to handle

general 2020-05-12 04:15:53 except mine because B)
general 2020-05-12 04:16:06 nobody can follow the guidelines
general 2020-05-12 04:16:11 and have trash moderation
general 2020-05-12 04:16:18 and refuse to fix it
general 2020-05-12 04:16:46 and me
general 2020-05-12 04:16:53 since i had the original idea
general 2020-05-12 04:17:00 to create a community discord
general 2020-05-12 04:17:45 my server was the first server created for plane crazy

general 2020-05-12 04:22:25 basically all the servers are dead

plane-crazy 2020-05-12 05:07:31 make a perm mute actually permanent

plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:25:06 orangeskii had kids
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:25:25 hmm now we got a food source
general 2020-05-12 18:26:57 
general 2020-05-12 18:28:17 steam can you not
general 2020-05-12 18:28:37 BRH
general 2020-05-12 18:28:43 is just decided to open up
general 2020-05-12 18:28:51 because i closed it
general 2020-05-12 18:29:28 it does not run upon start
general 2020-05-12 18:33:20 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-05-12 18:33:37 no because ghost ping
general 2020-05-12 18:33:46 also it will show in the audit logs
general 2020-05-12 18:33:57 so he will still be in trouble
general 2020-05-12 18:35:38 i dont care for it
general 2020-05-12 18:35:43 i dont need speakers
general 2020-05-12 18:36:15 honestly it makes little difference that speakers are going to be added
general 2020-05-12 18:36:26 in my opinion they really should not be
general 2020-05-12 18:36:30 because
general 2020-05-12 18:36:39 every speaker is one wedge we are not going to get
general 2020-05-12 18:36:48 or one glitch that will not be fixed
general 2020-05-12 18:37:51 420 best price
general 2020-05-12 18:38:13 no because then
general 2020-05-12 18:38:27 you know how cancerous it would be?
general 2020-05-12 18:38:46 that low would actually ruin the game
general 2020-05-12 18:39:20 because we would have hundreds of kids running around playing horrible songs, annoying people
general 2020-05-12 18:39:30 or even playing NSFW
general 2020-05-12 18:39:35 and bypassing filter
general 2020-05-12 18:39:38 with speakers
general 2020-05-12 18:39:50 the price is high to prevent it
general 2020-05-12 18:40:07 yet low enough so that people could afford it
general 2020-05-12 18:41:57 <@456226577798135808> The price is high too prevent people from spamming annoying songs and sounds, along with playing any questionable, inappropriate, or NSFW sounds that would be in violation of the Roblox ToS.
general 2020-05-12 18:42:10 along with filter Bypassing
general 2020-05-12 18:42:48 because rick actually would rather that not happen
general 2020-05-12 18:42:57 the price is not going to be changed
general 2020-05-12 18:43:08 if you want to use speakers go find another game
general 2020-05-12 18:44:14 just because you have not heard any bad songs or sounds in jailbreak does not mean that they dont exist
general 2020-05-12 18:45:59 still
general 2020-05-12 18:46:09 better to just prevent
general 2020-05-12 18:48:00 <@456226577798135808> its Bob the Builder
general 2020-05-12 18:49:14 best anime is Dr. Phil
general 2020-05-12 18:50:09 i was forced to eat a pot of macaroni while watching Dr. Phil
general 2020-05-12 18:50:22 i struggled
general 2020-05-12 18:51:02 vibrate
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:54:50 its a start
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:55:00 we could get more wedge designs
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:55:11 if rick uses what he did with the thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:55:20 we could gets curvy bois
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:56:08 2x2 corner wedges and up
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 18:57:24 meanwhile in vip1
general 2020-05-12 19:03:52 wut
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:17:19 im asking the same thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:36:30 
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:36:47 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:37:10 6.5k blocks and barely even finished
general 2020-05-12 19:46:05 ping
general 2020-05-12 19:52:19 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-05-12 19:56:32 i dont believe the advertisements
general 2020-05-12 19:56:39 they say nation wide 5g network
general 2020-05-12 19:57:10 literally the only cities in my state that have 5g networks at Madison, Milwaukee, and Green Bay
general 2020-05-12 19:57:14 the 3 largest
general 2020-05-12 19:57:43 also 5g is going to kill a lot of birds
general 2020-05-12 19:57:52 when compared to 4g
general 2020-05-12 19:58:34 the signals from cell towers and whatever may transmit data can cause cancer
general 2020-05-12 19:58:40 or mess up migration patterns
general 2020-05-12 19:59:19 if its microwaves then it would be worse
general 2020-05-12 19:59:29 since microwaves also cook your food
general 2020-05-12 19:59:35 when you put it in the microwave
general 2020-05-12 20:00:30 i just know the waves excite particles in the food, making them vibrate with more energy, thus making the food hotter
general 2020-05-12 20:00:57 so if no cancer then fried bird
general 2020-05-12 20:01:07 imagine it raining chicken
general 2020-05-12 20:01:24 fried chicken
general 2020-05-12 20:02:21 what i go to Chernobyl

general 2020-05-12 21:39:59 i brought fireworks inside and lit them
general 2020-05-12 21:40:10 and caused a fire
general 2020-05-12 21:40:28 <:pogey:651848693842182144>

general 2020-05-12 21:42:23 do you ever just ######

general 2020-05-12 21:44:47 Dr. Stone
general 2020-05-12 21:44:58 breaking statues since 2967
general 2020-05-12 21:45:17 actually it is 2767
general 2020-05-12 21:45:27 for some reason i thought the year was 2220
general 2020-05-12 21:46:14 i though it was 700-800 years
general 2020-05-12 21:46:37 if it was thousands there would be little evidence of civilization
general 2020-05-12 21:46:45 you can still see some concrete structures
general 2020-05-12 22:01:02 <@!296280922771292170> in the early episodes
general 2020-05-12 22:01:13 probably later too
general 2020-05-12 22:01:37 at that time it looks like the rocks with all the foliage
general 2020-05-12 22:02:00 but the shapes do not look naturally occuring
general 2020-05-12 22:02:17 almost like beams for a building or other structure
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:04:16 B-25
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:04:36 i attempted something like the B-25
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:04:52 before i knew how to commit half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:05:07 so the tail especially looked bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:05:28 you could put two motors together
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 22:05:36 get the added speed from 2 or more motors
general 2020-05-12 22:56:21 <@!704745603539796030> you think that plane has some NSFW?
general 2020-05-12 22:56:47 try this
general 2020-05-12 22:56:54 warning
general 2020-05-12 22:57:06 it is very not safe for work as a pilot
general 2020-05-12 22:57:58 you will both be amused, but also very concerned
general 2020-05-12 22:58:39 why does that single seat, and single engine plane have a bomb bay?

general 2020-05-13 03:04:18 <@!572105029222137858> i got my aeronautical engineer by phase shifting at mach 1,000,000,000 before ranks were redone
general 2020-05-13 03:04:27 i have never completed a plane above 500 blocks
general 2020-05-13 03:05:07 so i made a plane that nearly broke 4000 blocks
general 2020-05-13 03:05:27 but never completed it as plane crazy lacked a engine powerful enough to make it fly
general 2020-05-13 03:05:33 and make it fly realistically
general 2020-05-13 03:05:46 like realistically fast
general 2020-05-13 03:06:03 though now with the advent of conveyor engines i can now do hat
general 2020-05-13 03:06:22 also im a whole lot better with wedges
general 2020-05-13 03:06:50 conveyor engine most efficient engine
general 2020-05-13 03:07:30 YO
general 2020-05-13 03:08:21 i could remake this cancer
general 2020-05-13 03:08:24 10k blocks
general 2020-05-13 03:08:37 never finished it because it got way too laggy
general 2020-05-13 03:08:56 had full interior too
general 2020-05-13 03:09:38 it even had vending machines
general 2020-05-13 03:09:47 which are trash
general 2020-05-13 03:09:56 compared to the stuff we can do today
general 2020-05-13 03:10:02 with signs and such
general 2020-05-13 03:10:28 no it is a slaughter house
general 2020-05-13 03:11:07 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-05-13 03:11:55 you got killed?
general 2020-05-13 03:11:56 wow

general 2020-05-13 04:50:00 war thunder just updated
general 2020-05-13 05:00:36 first message of wednesday
general 2020-05-13 05:03:17 arguing against a moderators action never goes anywhere since they always have solid evidence justifying your ban
general 2020-05-13 05:04:37 whenever you get warned, muted, kicked, or banned the bot will send a dm with a reasoning behind it
general 2020-05-13 05:04:57 then ask why
general 2020-05-13 05:05:22 i dont discord ban has even been used
general 2020-05-13 05:05:34 it is usually Dyno
general 2020-05-13 05:05:40 Mee6 if Dyno is down
general 2020-05-13 05:05:57 none of the mods are new to discord
general 2020-05-13 05:06:42 you provided no context that suggested it was a different server
general 2020-05-13 05:06:54 you just complained about getting banned
general 2020-05-13 05:07:21 and i assumed it was from here because so many people complain about getting banned
general 2020-05-13 05:07:38 and always saying they have no idea why
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 05:08:08 a literal body pillow
the-dump 2020-05-14 03:39:29 like minecraft enderman
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 03:57:09 i think somebody might be already making it
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:20:59 Mitshubishi T-2
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:21:08 I remember when that was the fastest jet ingame
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:21:13 before i started playing
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:21:36 now we the F4 Phantom II that can go twice the speed of the T-2
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:33:30 <@!508954887699169290> you can make your own treads
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:33:46 also you can use smoke or snow pipes for smoke
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:55:51 until you get sleep deprivation
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:55:54 and then
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:56:07 sleep is for sanity
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:56:10 and not dying
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:56:22 fonkje

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:09:25 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:09:32 the virus is spreading
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:12:40 i thought it was contained in sparklers
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:12:55 all the scientists said it was
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:12:59 not it is spreading
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:13:04 infecting other blocks
bug-reports 2020-05-14 05:44:25 im afraid to try and load anything tbh
bug-reports 2020-05-14 05:45:15 since i saw a slight issue with sparklers being corrupt on my biggest build
general 2020-05-14 05:48:03 <@!500443537389912074>
general 2020-05-14 05:48:04 you just

general 2020-05-14 05:48:25 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 05:56:25 why assume gender?
general 2020-05-14 16:00:00 you guess
general 2020-05-14 16:00:13 possibly
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:03:33 i do that all the time
general 2020-05-14 16:05:42 who the what is loli?
general 2020-05-14 16:06:04 also youtube keeps advertising dating sites
general 2020-05-14 16:06:15 for russian singles
general 2020-05-14 16:06:35 it knows i have no life but it also does not know im not russian and im not 18 yet

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:19:39 Paradian like
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:19:56 like feasting on aircraft carriers
general 2020-05-14 16:21:16 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-14 16:21:46 i watch a youtuber called Pecos Hank and War Thunder
general 2020-05-14 16:21:54 sometimes other stuff if it interests me
general 2020-05-14 16:22:18 and my brother watches unspeakable gaming when he steals my kindle and watches youtube on that
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:23:14 its a jet
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:23:22 there is my opinion
general 2020-05-14 16:24:13 tea
general 2020-05-14 16:24:15 hot bath
general 2020-05-14 16:24:22 read book
general 2020-05-14 16:24:53 search for glitches in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:25:14 
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:26:57 who knows
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:32 wait they removed genres?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:36 whaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:41 why though?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:43 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:45 he
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:27:57 double-U tee ef
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:28:17 that is stupid
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:28:22 but not surprising
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:28:47 because robox is mentally disabled
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:29:22 i can only name a few original genres
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:29:46 Horror, Sci-fi, Town and Country, and City
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:31:33 best but most glitchy
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:31:58 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:32:01 that is basically
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:32:03 every day
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:32:25 imagine if plane crazy became the most played game
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:32:35 then we would have to blame plane crazy for server issues
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:33:22 but we would still be required by law to blame plane crazy for roblox server troubles
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:33:40 because the game with the most playing is automatically the one that broke the servers
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:34:05 i would not be surprised if they did
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:34:16 to them that would be a best business choice
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:34:25 ban 90% of their player base
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:34:28 best business idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:34:54 but then plane crazy would die
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:35:01 most the player base is undes
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:35:23 also rick would likely stop developing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:35:36 since we would be the only ones to buy gamepasses
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:35:47 and we have mostly bought all the game passes
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:35:55 so rick would get no money
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:36:50 plane crazy youtubers would do nothing to help plane crazy tbh
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:36:54 unless clickbait
general 2020-05-14 16:39:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 16:40:09 im making a borgor
general 2020-05-14 17:12:54 you mean the one minecraft update that only benefits me in the sense i get more block to mess with
general 2020-05-14 17:13:01 because i dont do survival
general 2020-05-14 17:13:22 and netherite is extremely tricky to get
general 2020-05-14 17:13:26 and time consuming
general 2020-05-14 17:13:39 and almost not even worth it
general 2020-05-14 17:13:55 map
general 2020-05-14 17:15:20 netherite is barely worth it in my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 17:28:42 <#498473314445033472>

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:12:23 i dont care about them
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:12:29 so im not even going to buy them
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:28:05 as more and more is added to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:28:14 we get worse and more complex glitches
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:28:30 eventually rick is going to need to recode plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:28:45 else we cannot have more updates if they are just going to keep on breaking the game
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:29:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:30:07 but would you prefer broken plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:30:19 were save files just keep getting corrupted
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:30:43 and apparently entire people
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:32:20 i have never been into the style of game that is pubg
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:40:26 why is shadow eating rocks?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:50:29 what else is new
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:55:41 never played fortnite

general 2020-05-14 22:20:25 and that is like the only thing i can think of
general 2020-05-14 22:21:27 yeah no slowmode

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 22:44:18 it has lava spitter
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 22:44:26 but fireworks are winter

bot-central 2020-05-15 03:25:46 hmmm
bot-central 2020-05-15 03:25:48 quality
general 2020-05-15 03:44:23 yeah gaijin is trying to make my war thunder experience bad
general 2020-05-15 03:44:30 this german fella
general 2020-05-15 03:44:34 with a big gun
general 2020-05-15 03:44:39 pulls up right in front of me
general 2020-05-15 03:44:46 and i have a lag spike
general 2020-05-15 03:44:50 like a major one
general 2020-05-15 03:44:55 right then and there
general 2020-05-15 03:45:17 and not when a 2000 kilogram bomb was dropped destroyed 10 city blocks
general 2020-05-15 03:45:23 and killing 4 tanks
general 2020-05-15 03:45:29 but he did not see me
general 2020-05-15 03:45:37 so i shot him and he go big boom
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 03:47:27 <@!553312206150696969> i already saw that same message
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 03:47:31 2 months ago
general 2020-05-15 04:06:18 chonk
general 2020-05-15 04:09:37 really

general 2020-05-15 04:12:09 i originally wanted to be a developer
general 2020-05-15 04:12:20 but then i lost inspiration
general 2020-05-15 04:12:32 since i wanted to do stuff that did not fit the roblox community
general 2020-05-15 04:12:42 and would have almost no chance of going anywhere
general 2020-05-15 04:25:38 you cannot make me furry
general 2020-05-15 04:25:54 totally
general 2020-05-15 04:26:10 really?

general 2020-05-15 04:29:15 rabbits can [REDACTED]
general 2020-05-15 04:31:29 that depression though
general 2020-05-15 04:38:27 what about Quantum Science?
general 2020-05-15 04:38:34 and rickje
general 2020-05-15 04:40:14 yeah
general 2020-05-15 04:40:20 Quantum is interesting
general 2020-05-15 04:40:46 but it has a really good community
general 2020-05-15 04:40:48 and yeah
general 2020-05-15 04:40:53 they have some top tier work
general 2020-05-15 04:41:01 QSERF
general 2020-05-15 04:41:28 there are actually two DMR sites made
general 2020-05-15 04:41:39 the staple of Quantum Science
general 2020-05-15 04:41:55 and supposedly two other games
general 2020-05-15 04:41:59 under construction
general 2020-05-15 04:42:19 ive played their games
general 2020-05-15 04:42:33 they have planned like literally everything
general 2020-05-15 04:42:40 from storyline
general 2020-05-15 04:42:45 to construction
general 2020-05-15 04:43:29 is that the un copy locked QSERF version?
general 2020-05-15 04:44:05 i wonder how many scripts there are
general 2020-05-15 04:44:30 it crashes studio for me
general 2020-05-15 04:44:32 but yeah
general 2020-05-15 04:49:03 you have elevators, diagonal elevators, corkscrew elevators, doors, keycard doors, automatic doors, blast doors, airlocks, the main seal, reactor ops seal, Hadron Collider, Hadron Collider Controls, used to be a centrifuge, cooling system controls, DMR power system controls, DMR startup sequence, DMR shutdown sequence (both maintenance and emergency), DMR meltdown, EAS alert, Nuclear warhead, and Tartarus ventilation controls
general 2020-05-15 04:49:07 just to name a few
general 2020-05-15 04:49:09 systems
general 2020-05-15 04:49:14 of the QSERF
general 2020-05-15 04:49:36 i could go farther
general 2020-05-15 04:50:48 oh nice
general 2020-05-15 04:51:03 i find both tedious
general 2020-05-15 04:51:16 oh and one system i forgot
general 2020-05-15 04:51:32 Sunday night grill on top of the Dark Matter Reactor
general 2020-05-15 04:51:40 during on time
general 2020-05-15 04:51:46 that is fun
general 2020-05-15 04:51:57 get some bar-b-que ribs
general 2020-05-15 04:51:58 steak
general 2020-05-15 04:52:03 some chicken
general 2020-05-15 04:52:39 just take it out of the package and then set on the reactor casing
general 2020-05-15 04:53:42 until the reactor runs out of fuel and then you have to wait about a year for the team of usually 6-8 people to complete a job one person could do in maybe 10 minutes
general 2020-05-15 04:54:10 the only issue is the trip
general 2020-05-15 04:54:13 you have to walk
general 2020-05-15 04:54:14 far
general 2020-05-15 04:54:14 so
general 2020-05-15 04:55:14 imagine getting a degree in Nuclear Physics by playing a roblox roleplay set in an experimental nuclear reactor in 1985
general 2020-05-15 04:55:50 i have no clue
general 2020-05-15 04:55:52 what i want to do
general 2020-05-15 04:56:17 the first reactor game i played was Innovation Space Ship
general 2020-05-15 04:56:24 then i got a better computer
general 2020-05-15 04:56:37 and played Innovation Arctic Base
general 2020-05-15 04:56:42 same
general 2020-05-15 04:56:46 i just found it
general 2020-05-15 04:56:56 and immediately fell in love with it
general 2020-05-15 04:56:58 so
general 2020-05-15 04:57:01 detailed
general 2020-05-15 04:57:12 and at least there is some science behind it
general 2020-05-15 04:57:26 and explanations behind basically everything
general 2020-05-15 04:58:02 Innovation Inc is just a magic read blob that you explode
general 2020-05-15 04:59:27 the Quantum Science Energy Research Facility is a energy research facility in someplace New Jersey i think based on August 18, 1985
general 2020-05-15 05:00:37 so
general 2020-05-15 05:00:42 you are slave
general 2020-05-15 05:01:10 well then it no longer nuclear reactor
general 2020-05-15 05:01:14 unless
general 2020-05-15 05:01:22 you explained it like i tried to once
general 2020-05-15 05:01:52 magnetically suspended open field fusion reactor
general 2020-05-15 05:02:11 i had an idea once
general 2020-05-15 05:02:22 to build
general 2020-05-15 05:02:28 a reactor game
general 2020-05-15 05:02:44 based around research on creating artificial stars
general 2020-05-15 05:03:17 it would also have a cafeteria because
general 2020-05-15 05:03:22 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 05:42:15 yes
general 2020-05-15 16:11:48 nice somebody was banned
general 2020-05-15 16:12:35 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-15 16:13:10 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:14:09 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:14:26 unless you are to report a game breaking glitch
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:14:31 then you can in <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:15:01 oh and you cant ping madattak because he will never respond
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:15:03 ever
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:16:13 im trying to imagine what that would look like
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:16:19 that system you are using
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:18:27 you can also use wing panels and use motors to angle them
the-dump 2020-05-15 16:23:17 No they probably would still shoot you
the-dump 2020-05-15 16:23:48 unless you run out of ammo or set your weapons on the ground
the-dump 2020-05-15 16:24:37 then you basically go to capitalist prison where you are subject to massive amounts anti communist propaganda
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:27:26 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:27:32 180 or 90
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:27:44 best would be 180
general 2020-05-15 16:28:02 no
general 2020-05-15 16:28:21 <:pogey:651848693842182144>

general 2020-05-15 17:38:42 other then Paradise, Nevada
general 2020-05-15 17:38:48 that is about it
general 2020-05-15 17:39:42 and Disneyland

plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:38:25 it summons the potato gods <@!554421436673163265>
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:38:43 what does an anchor do?
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:39:19 how do you not know what an anchor is?
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:40:16 the anchor block does an anchor does smh
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:40:25 it holds something in place
general 2020-05-15 18:42:54 hmm yes
general 2020-05-15 18:42:57 Hong Kong
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:57:48 what if you made that a perfect loop
general 2020-05-15 18:59:23 Gaijin really needs to fix the naval tech trees
general 2020-05-15 19:00:01 a fishing boat costs more then a heavy cruiser
general 2020-05-15 19:00:40 this thing
general 2020-05-15 19:01:00 costs about as much as the USS Portland
general 2020-05-15 19:01:17 the only difference is repair costs
general 2020-05-15 19:02:03 no wonder naval battles are scarce
general 2020-05-15 19:02:10 the economy is messed up
general 2020-05-15 19:04:45 its the same with all nations with naval forces except germany
general 2020-05-15 19:05:04 because german cruisers are bigger then american
general 2020-05-15 19:05:14 because Gayjin
general 2020-05-15 19:05:46 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-05-15 19:06:30 if battleships and more advanced ships are added to complete the era
general 2020-05-15 19:06:44 the tech trees will be redone and hopefully pricing changed
general 2020-05-15 19:06:58 and hopefully the R3 T20 is put back in its era
general 2020-05-15 19:07:06 instead of fighting WWII tanks
general 2020-05-15 19:07:31 it was literally made in the 1980's
general 2020-05-15 19:07:37 not 1940's and earlier
general 2020-05-15 19:09:06 the R3 is not at all bad
general 2020-05-15 19:09:17 its overperforming actually
general 2020-05-15 19:09:39 its faster then everything of its battle rating
general 2020-05-15 19:10:33 it has a greater fire rate then the Wirbelwind with 4 auto cannons
general 2020-05-15 19:11:23 the wirbel is practically a Vulcan machine gun
general 2020-05-15 19:11:35 yet the R3 has a better fire rate
general 2020-05-15 19:12:06 granted it has no armor but not that is matters at higher tiers where it should belong
general 2020-05-15 19:12:31 it makes a better tank destroyer then an AA vehicle
general 2020-05-15 19:12:40 mainly due to penetration and speed
general 2020-05-15 19:14:47 its also got a two plane stabilizer
general 2020-05-15 19:14:57 meaning you can shoot and move at the same time
general 2020-05-15 19:16:19 it needs to be at a higher BR
general 2020-05-15 19:16:37 where it can actually be an AA vehicle
general 2020-05-15 19:20:54 BR 5.7 about is a better range for the R3 T20
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 19:22:37 impossible

general 2020-05-15 19:38:31 there are humane ways to punish your dog
general 2020-05-15 19:38:44 oh Chihuahua
general 2020-05-15 19:39:05 Chihuahaus are evil

general 2020-05-15 19:39:11 dogs
general 2020-05-15 19:39:38 i would never ever get a Chihuahua

general 2020-05-16 19:09:52 Rank II naval be like
general 2020-05-16 19:10:14 A freaking battleship is cheaper
general 2020-05-16 19:11:29 im skipping the entire second tier
general 2020-05-16 19:11:45 at least you only have to purchase two ships
general 2020-05-16 19:11:57 which is still absurdly expensive
general 2020-05-16 19:12:24 and the research grind to get through tier II is a war crime
general 2020-05-16 19:12:58 but at least you dont have to purchase 4-6 ships like the other tiers
general 2020-05-16 19:14:49 the one time i want to buy a premium vehicles
general 2020-05-16 19:14:59 to skip tier II naval research
general 2020-05-16 19:15:09 or at least make it faster
general 2020-05-16 19:15:14 get through quicker

general 2020-05-16 21:14:03 i dont think you even have that many blocks

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:47:29 that is the hull though
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:47:37 not good pic
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:48:05 here eat best waterline ever
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:53:15 why is vip1 full now?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:53:28 when i was one originally it had like 3 or 4 people in it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 04:53:38 when vip1 and 2 are usually filled
general 2020-05-17 05:05:34 i have no idea what they could be
general 2020-05-17 05:05:49 they are not ranks
general 2020-05-17 05:06:00 so something that might not be important
the-dump 2020-05-17 05:20:16 meanwhile in this server
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 05:21:43 my ship keeps listing despite using helium in the superstructure and pontoons at the waterline in the hull
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 05:21:57 even using fabric pontoons for the extra bouyancy

bug-reports 2020-05-17 05:32:30 self explanatory
bug-reports 2020-05-17 05:33:31 also fix the color saving issue with trails that were supposedly fixed yet it still is not at all gone
general 2020-05-17 05:36:38 yeah
general 2020-05-17 05:36:44 it is literally beind advertised on TV
general 2020-05-17 05:37:16 i only put in my password wrong one time
general 2020-05-17 05:42:39 i never have issues with being locked out except with websites needed for school work and trying to log into my War Gaming account
general 2020-05-17 05:43:05 because WG is strict on what you can use for your password
general 2020-05-17 05:43:40 they want you to have complex passwords but they only let you use letters numbers and basically that is it
general 2020-05-17 05:44:29 because i cannot put in my simple yet wonky passwords
general 2020-05-17 05:44:33 and i always forget it
general 2020-05-17 05:44:43 no
general 2020-05-17 05:44:55 yes
general 2020-05-17 05:45:18 and you cannot use stuff like @ # $ & and anything along those lines
general 2020-05-17 05:45:25 or punctuation marks
general 2020-05-17 05:46:01 they basically force you to put in a password like Password_178
general 2020-05-17 05:46:54 i just reset my password everytime i log in
general 2020-05-17 05:47:10 that is
general 2020-05-17 05:47:14 assuming i log in
general 2020-05-17 05:47:31 i have not played and war gaming games for like a month
general 2020-05-17 05:47:46 that one time i played WoWS because i was bored
general 2020-05-17 05:47:59 then stopped after the first match because i forgot about the RNG
general 2020-05-17 05:48:33 but hey i got 2 months of premium, 5000 free xp, i think a free ship, and 10 million credits
general 2020-05-17 05:48:44 because i have not played for like 4 months before that
general 2020-05-17 05:49:44 restart it or something
general 2020-05-17 05:49:53 i dont know how drawing tablets work
general 2020-05-17 05:50:17 so i can only suggest the universal troubleshooting techniques
general 2020-05-17 05:50:25 like shut it down and turn it back
general 2020-05-17 05:50:30 and if that does not work
general 2020-05-17 05:50:36 just hit it repeatedly
general 2020-05-17 05:50:52 oh i do that all the time
general 2020-05-17 05:50:58 i will stand up
general 2020-05-17 05:51:05 and go running out my bedroom
general 2020-05-17 05:51:27 and i take my headphones with me because they always get tangled around my arms
general 2020-05-17 05:51:38 a just yank the cord from my computer
general 2020-05-17 05:51:48 or it will get stuck on my chair arm
general 2020-05-17 05:52:00 i have strong cheap headphones
general 2020-05-17 05:52:37 i dont draw
general 2020-05-17 05:52:45 and i dont how expensive a drawing tablet is
general 2020-05-17 05:52:55 so i have no idea how big an issue it is
general 2020-05-17 05:55:12 in USD that is a mild price
general 2020-05-17 16:02:00 War Funder test servers are opening
general 2020-05-17 16:02:14 and sadly i dont think anything is changing to naval battles

general 2020-05-17 16:26:42 no
general 2020-05-17 16:27:02 but i did have an issue where i was stuck in the spawn screen in a match
general 2020-05-17 16:27:09 and all i could do was spectate
general 2020-05-17 16:27:19 but i never had any lineup issues
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:42:42 just as bad as winter here
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:43:08 winter here is sub zero and windy
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:43:14 summer is the exact opposite
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:43:27 freaking hot, humid, and no wind
general 2020-05-17 16:47:48 war thunder locked me in the loading screen
general 2020-05-17 16:47:53 so i had to force it to close

general 2020-05-17 16:48:45 its dead now
general 2020-05-17 16:49:02 i also know how to close

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:28:10 uuh you take two blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:28:19 and place them so they are touching each other
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:28:33 and they automatically connect
general 2020-05-17 18:49:58 like when you spawn?
general 2020-05-17 19:00:35 i always take the left leg
general 2020-05-17 19:00:41 plenty of meat
general 2020-05-17 19:09:20 somebody might wanna go help that carrier
general 2020-05-17 19:09:47 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-17 19:10:02 i close chrome when i dont need it
general 2020-05-17 19:10:31 yes
general 2020-05-17 19:10:47 but it is sunday
general 2020-05-17 19:10:54 it is the weekend
general 2020-05-17 19:11:20 imagine if you do stuff over the weekend
general 2020-05-17 19:11:25 so you cannot do homeworkk
general 2020-05-17 19:12:12 i dont think any teacher in my school assigns homework over the weekends
general 2020-05-17 19:12:34 probably because in this area everybody knows where each other lives
general 2020-05-17 19:12:54 so assigning homework during the weekend would get you killed
general 2020-05-17 19:13:01 over the weekends nobody cares
general 2020-05-17 19:13:13 but during would be very dangerous
general 2020-05-17 19:13:32 well then follow their regulations
general 2020-05-17 19:13:49 you cannot get in trouble then
general 2020-05-17 19:14:01 no matter how hard the teachers try it is the regulations
general 2020-05-17 19:14:33 oh we only have like 5 question google form tests
general 2020-05-17 19:15:03 yeah small farming community around here
general 2020-05-17 19:15:10 we get light work
general 2020-05-17 19:15:38 everything is usually due a day after it is assigned
general 2020-05-17 19:16:05 my school is incredibly chill
general 2020-05-17 19:16:15 except elementary school
general 2020-05-17 19:16:38 elementary school is like Battle of Kursk but it never ends
general 2020-05-17 19:17:37 middle school is slowly turning into that because all the kids new to this area from the elementary school are coming over
general 2020-05-17 19:17:48 we have a lot of new people coming in from city areas
general 2020-05-17 19:17:53 and they are the worst
general 2020-05-17 19:18:05 everyone that comes from other farming areas are chill
general 2020-05-17 19:18:10 and really good people
general 2020-05-17 19:19:00 I would hate to live in a large city with a family
general 2020-05-17 19:19:15 We have some nice neighbors
general 2020-05-17 19:19:34 Oh and the police could do nothing about it
general 2020-05-17 19:19:42 since you were not doing anything illegal
general 2020-05-17 19:19:51 and it was on your property
general 2020-05-17 19:20:34 We had some neighbors last year that moved out
general 2020-05-17 19:20:55 they would like to call our landlord and complain about our dog pooping in their yard
general 2020-05-17 19:21:04 when he is tied up so he cannot go on their yard
general 2020-05-17 19:21:15 and there are about a billion stray cats in the area
general 2020-05-17 19:21:34 which are mostly gone now
general 2020-05-17 19:21:40 but yeah they kept reporting us
general 2020-05-17 19:21:50 and after they figured out the landlord would do nothing
general 2020-05-17 19:21:59 i think they called the cops on us
general 2020-05-17 19:22:12 but our area cop that was on duty at the time went to school with my mom
general 2020-05-17 19:22:36 and knew at that point knew she did nothing
general 2020-05-17 19:22:49 there are no tutorials
general 2020-05-17 19:22:53 just find a pic online
general 2020-05-17 19:22:56 and build from that
general 2020-05-17 19:23:57 control panel block?
general 2020-05-17 19:24:09 called the police
general 2020-05-17 19:24:11 who did nothing
general 2020-05-17 19:24:27 because the cop on duty at the time knew my mom
general 2020-05-17 19:24:35 and thus figured they were lying
general 2020-05-17 19:25:27 then they were kicked from their house for destruction, fire safety violation, littering, and not controlling a rat problem
general 2020-05-17 19:25:51 the house was completely remodeled and new people moved it
general 2020-05-17 19:25:57 not Karen
general 2020-05-17 19:26:12 really big person
general 2020-05-17 19:26:25 with two sons who were just as big
general 2020-05-17 19:26:43 dropped out of highschool early to play call of duty
general 2020-05-17 19:26:48 and both were adults
general 2020-05-17 19:28:01 but new people moved in who have 2 daughters, a baby of who knows what gender, they have a rabbit (violation of city code: no livestock) and a guinea pig
general 2020-05-17 19:28:40 yeah but it is still considered livestock for some dumb reason
general 2020-05-17 19:28:49 but you can have free range chickens
general 2020-05-17 19:28:52 in the middle of town
general 2020-05-17 19:29:09 where they can wander off and start destroying property
general 2020-05-17 19:29:34 but literally no one cares and the town is not willing to enforce it
general 2020-05-17 19:30:14 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-17 19:30:42 other then that there is no drama that happens in my town
general 2020-05-17 19:30:44 other then
general 2020-05-17 19:30:46 how are they
general 2020-05-17 19:30:58 going to build the roundabout and repair the main road
general 2020-05-17 19:31:35 wdym a hole?
general 2020-05-17 19:32:26 but how would digging a hole redirect it?
general 2020-05-17 19:32:47 i dont understand
general 2020-05-17 19:33:51 could you just fix the hole, make a little pond to collect the water, and run the excess down his path
general 2020-05-17 19:34:41 if was public land he cannot sue you for it
general 2020-05-17 19:34:47 if it was on your land you could sue him
general 2020-05-17 19:34:54 if it was on his land then he could sue you
general 2020-05-17 19:35:23 so public property
general 2020-05-17 19:35:29 meaning he can do nothing for it
general 2020-05-17 19:36:03 and actually the county or city or whoever owned the land could sue him for destruction of public property
general 2020-05-17 19:36:16 while you were trying to fight him by repairing the damage
general 2020-05-17 19:37:35 what if you took a boulder and blocked his hole
general 2020-05-17 19:38:03 or bought a big tree and planted it where the hole is
general 2020-05-17 19:38:11 the tree would have fresh water
general 2020-05-17 19:38:36 and assuming he did not disturb it, or was dumb enough to loose the hole's original place
general 2020-05-17 19:40:02 4 years?
general 2020-05-17 19:40:22 im pretty sure the state or county would be willing
general 2020-05-17 19:40:56 but 4 years
general 2020-05-17 19:41:25 you could have also gut a well dug
general 2020-05-17 19:41:57 its always wet here
general 2020-05-17 19:42:07 in fact the water level is almost rising
general 2020-05-17 19:43:35 We have a high water table, the Mississippi, Kickapoo, and Wisconsin Rivers, a couple of lakes (R.I.P Jersey Valley) and many streams
general 2020-05-17 19:43:50 oh and lots of rain in spring and fall
general 2020-05-17 19:44:35 Jersey Valley was a state park and dammed lake
general 2020-05-17 19:44:53 one year we had tons and tons of rain for a week straight
general 2020-05-17 19:45:04 cancelled the first week of school
general 2020-05-17 19:45:23 and multiple dams were destroyed including the Jersey Valley one
general 2020-05-17 19:45:30 and now that lake is basically gone
general 2020-05-17 19:45:51 we had water being forced up into our basement through the sewer system
general 2020-05-17 19:45:56 it was so full of water
general 2020-05-17 19:46:32 during the peak of the storm there was a a jet of water about 15 feat high coming from a drain
general 2020-05-17 19:46:45 so much water being forced through the sewers
general 2020-05-17 19:47:09 i think we only lost power twice
general 2020-05-17 19:47:15 for a couple minutes at a time
general 2020-05-17 19:47:32 first time i was going up the stairs from the basement
general 2020-05-17 19:47:40 nearly killed myself
general 2020-05-17 19:47:51 and the second time was in the bathroom
general 2020-05-17 19:48:04 so i could not see literally anything
general 2020-05-17 19:48:18 so i just stood there waiting for the power to come back
general 2020-05-17 19:48:58 i know my house well too
general 2020-05-17 19:49:12 but i dont know those random obstacles
general 2020-05-17 19:49:22 or my cat or dog that like to get under your feat
general 2020-05-17 19:50:04 we also had two dead trees that were removed after
general 2020-05-17 19:50:16 so if one fell i was likely to become a pancake
general 2020-05-17 19:50:36 both were destroyed by bugs and woodpeckers
general 2020-05-17 19:51:02 that reminds me
general 2020-05-17 19:51:15 in North Dakota we had this absolutely massive tree
general 2020-05-17 19:51:45 imagine one of those gigantic trees from the movie Avatar
general 2020-05-17 19:51:49 if you have ever watched it
general 2020-05-17 19:51:54 it was basically that
general 2020-05-17 19:52:10 only half dead and rotting down at the bottom
general 2020-05-17 19:53:00 or area used to be what is known as a Prairie Savanna
general 2020-05-17 19:53:09 only the oldest oaks were around
general 2020-05-17 19:53:19 now all the valley walls are filled with trees
general 2020-05-17 19:53:32 and it is just really green around here
general 2020-05-17 19:54:10 Western settlement brought lots of pretty plants, trees, birds, bears, wolves, bobcats and what not
general 2020-05-17 19:54:46 we have lots of hunters
general 2020-05-17 19:54:57 the local ones are friendly
general 2020-05-17 19:55:03 and try not to be destructive
general 2020-05-17 19:55:19 they like to donate their kill to food banks and meat lockers
general 2020-05-17 19:56:48 there was an old hydroelectric dam project near us
general 2020-05-17 19:56:53 that was cancelled
general 2020-05-17 19:57:40 because no one wanted to fund it, water quality, native animal life, and native american artifacts were found in the area that would have been flooded
general 2020-05-17 19:57:54 oh and microclimates that are found no where else in the world
general 2020-05-17 19:58:08 and little caves in the hills that stay frozen all year
general 2020-05-17 19:58:14 those would have been flooded
general 2020-05-17 19:58:45 and a plant nearly extinct was found there
general 2020-05-17 19:59:06 at that point the project was cancelled and the area designated a state park and reservation
general 2020-05-17 19:59:20 now that plant is basically everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:59:44 i do it on accident
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 20:00:05 Focus i just move my mouse off the roblox client
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 20:00:21 MouseMovement i detonated a nuclear bomb
general 2020-05-17 20:00:53 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-05-17 20:01:03 it gets cold during winter
general 2020-05-17 20:01:21 -10 to -30 for the lows
general 2020-05-17 20:01:34 but then during summer it gets like 90 degrees
general 2020-05-17 20:01:57 yes fahrenheit
general 2020-05-17 20:02:23 see that is why rick made the gamepass that expensive
general 2020-05-17 20:02:33 because that would happen
general 2020-05-17 20:03:15 im afraid those frozen caves will disappear though
general 2020-05-17 20:03:24 winters are getting a lot shorter and warmer
general 2020-05-17 20:03:37 and snow melts a lot now
general 2020-05-17 20:03:47 we still get aggressive amounts of snow
general 2020-05-17 20:03:53 it just melts so quickly
general 2020-05-17 20:04:40 the city of La Crosse was getting worried because of ice buildup on the Mississippi paired with runoff from melting snow
general 2020-05-17 20:05:13 2 days ago it was sunny and 70 degrees fahrenheit
general 2020-05-17 20:05:31 which is actually normal for this time of year
general 2020-05-17 20:05:53 right now it is 60 and rainy
general 2020-05-17 20:06:32 this week it might get upper 80s
general 2020-05-17 20:06:36 which is very warm
general 2020-05-17 20:06:57 my mom is excited because here plants will love it and so will she
general 2020-05-17 20:07:05 but im worried about the humidity
general 2020-05-17 20:07:08 how it will feel
general 2020-05-17 20:07:35 usually during summer around 70 and 100%
general 2020-05-17 20:07:45 thus making it feel like the hundreds
general 2020-05-17 20:08:03 and the flies and mosquitos make it dreadful
general 2020-05-17 20:08:22 but any mosquitos are dead
general 2020-05-17 20:08:27 so are the flies
general 2020-05-17 20:08:28 and bees
general 2020-05-17 20:08:31 and whatnot
general 2020-05-17 20:08:48 because 2 weeks ago we got body slammed by a winter vortex
general 2020-05-17 20:09:02 lest year we got body slammed by a winter vortex
general 2020-05-17 20:09:14 couple feet of snow and -70 degree wind chills
general 2020-05-17 20:09:39 somehow we never lost power
general 2020-05-17 20:09:43 thank god we did not
general 2020-05-17 20:09:59 that would be very very bad
general 2020-05-17 20:11:30 our bus stop is literally the corner of a road
general 2020-05-17 20:11:35 under a powerline
general 2020-05-17 20:11:43 so waiting during a thunderstorm
general 2020-05-17 20:11:47 is interesting
general 2020-05-17 20:12:00 that is actually basically every bus stop
general 2020-05-17 20:12:17 it is either a driveway, street corner
general 2020-05-17 20:13:18 on time our school lost water because when they were building our auditorium they cut the main line
general 2020-05-17 20:13:46 they repaired in like 2 days though
general 2020-05-17 20:14:20 and now the school is planning to either remodel the highschool, or do something with the music department
general 2020-05-17 20:14:43 completely neglecting the rundown bathrooms in the restrooms
general 2020-05-17 20:14:54 and the leaky roof around the entire school
general 2020-05-17 20:15:55 tbh i dont know what is in our water
general 2020-05-17 20:16:03 or where it comes from
general 2020-05-17 20:16:18 i assume wells built around the city
general 2020-05-17 20:16:47 the nearest water treatment plant is 30+ straight miles away
general 2020-05-17 20:17:04 about 50 if you follow roads
general 2020-05-17 20:17:24 and digging a line to our town would be expensive af
general 2020-05-17 20:17:26 and tedious
general 2020-05-17 20:17:40 because of the landscape
general 2020-05-17 20:17:55 and climate
general 2020-05-17 20:18:00 and all sorts of stuff
general 2020-05-17 20:18:52 <:Bruh:589676002221883403>
general 2020-05-17 20:19:19 we have high water pressure and boiling water because we have a water heater
general 2020-05-17 20:19:33 and im pretty sure our town has its own wells
general 2020-05-17 20:19:41 and some way of treating the water
general 2020-05-17 20:19:53 i know where our sewage goes
general 2020-05-17 20:19:56 but that is it
general 2020-05-17 20:20:34 no it goes into a swimming pool <@!500443537389912074>
general 2020-05-17 20:21:09 well now i think we send our sewage someplace else now
general 2020-05-17 20:21:16 the pools are used by the creamery now
general 2020-05-17 20:22:18 
general 2020-05-17 20:22:34 right next to the highschool football and track field
general 2020-05-17 20:23:23 we have the opposite because China
general 2020-05-17 20:25:30 Im the United States
general 2020-05-17 20:25:52 specifically the area where Eagles think they are flying the SBD Dauntless
general 2020-05-17 20:25:58 and will dive at you
general 2020-05-17 20:27:09 The United States is developing the sense we finally figured out Round-a-bouts are actually a good thing
general 2020-05-17 20:27:30 everything else is falling
general 2020-05-17 20:27:41 except the military
general 2020-05-17 20:27:49 no idea what they are doing
general 2020-05-17 20:28:06 other then the F-35 and Railguns
general 2020-05-17 20:28:39 Americans are starting to get annoyed with China
general 2020-05-17 20:28:46 not because of the Coronavirus
general 2020-05-17 20:28:54 well partly because of that
general 2020-05-17 20:29:01 their lack of communication
general 2020-05-17 20:29:23 <@!622320884987854858> that is part of the reason a lot of us are starting to hate china
general 2020-05-17 20:29:46 they have a lot of the jobs that people here are suffering because they could have those jobs
general 2020-05-17 20:30:21 China could honestly just have communicated
general 2020-05-17 20:30:30 shared their data about the coronavirus
general 2020-05-17 20:30:45 its a giant mess
general 2020-05-17 20:31:47 Who knows what Russia is doing
general 2020-05-17 20:34:54 random war thunder review on steam
general 2020-05-17 20:35:08 3700 hours on record
general 2020-05-17 20:37:06 eh
general 2020-05-17 20:37:10 it can be
general 2020-05-17 20:37:20 but really it depends on how you play
general 2020-05-17 20:37:23 and how well you play
general 2020-05-17 20:37:36 and how you grind each individual tech tree
general 2020-05-17 20:37:43 how big the tech tree is
general 2020-05-17 20:38:21 and all sorts of things
general 2020-05-17 20:38:41 if you want to include grinding naval trees
general 2020-05-17 20:38:42 yes
general 2020-05-17 20:38:47 it will take years
general 2020-05-17 20:38:53 unless you skip tier II
general 2020-05-17 20:38:57 then life will be easy
general 2020-05-17 20:39:04 but you still have to get through tier II
general 2020-05-17 20:39:30 research 3 vehicles to get destroyers
general 2020-05-17 20:39:35 buy the cheapest 2

general 2020-05-17 20:43:50 that
general 2020-05-17 20:43:58 needs to have a high BR
general 2020-05-17 20:44:01 5.7
general 2020-05-17 20:44:33 at its BR any shot thrown at it usually kills it, but that is assuming you get hit
general 2020-05-17 20:44:38 you are incredibly fast
general 2020-05-17 20:44:59 your gun can pen almost every tank at its BR
general 2020-05-17 20:45:17 you can kill by looking at them
general 2020-05-17 20:45:44 it has a faster fire rate with one gun the the Wirbelwind with 4 guns
general 2020-05-17 20:45:58 and you are also amphibious

general 2020-05-17 20:50:28 it was also made in 1980
general 2020-05-17 20:50:42 so it never fought against WWII tanks
general 2020-05-17 20:51:41 basically everything about the R3 is not balanced
general 2020-05-17 20:51:47 except the fact everything can pen it
general 2020-05-17 20:58:07 just report him saying he insulted the mod team
general 2020-05-17 20:59:09 if my theory is correct he should get IP banned and all his accounts terminated
general 2020-05-17 20:59:45 but dont say he was hacking

general 2020-05-18 16:32:17 yes
general 2020-05-18 16:32:19 best sight
general 2020-05-18 16:32:55 i dunno imma just go see what chaos is happening in war funder right now
general 2020-05-18 16:33:02 pertaining to jeeps with guided rockets
general 2020-05-18 16:33:43 do you even just submarine tank
general 2020-05-18 16:35:55 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
general 2020-05-18 16:36:02 im not really sure
general 2020-05-18 16:36:16 its one of those weird Paradian ideas
general 2020-05-18 16:36:24 a tank that can drive under ze water
general 2020-05-18 16:37:05 and it actually worked
general 2020-05-18 16:37:13 and it saw battles
general 2020-05-18 16:37:18 against garden fences
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:09:29 vip1 is always full
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:09:39 it really is not uncommon
general 2020-05-18 18:17:21 hmm yes Gaijin is very likely anti american
general 2020-05-18 18:17:55 i mean like Air battles
general 2020-05-18 18:18:51 there is about a 1023u82109473298436% chance that every american aircraft will be chopped up, grilled, thrown on the ground to decay and be eaten by the ants
general 2020-05-18 18:19:13 that is literally
general 2020-05-18 18:19:16 every air RB match
general 2020-05-18 18:20:19 same
general 2020-05-18 18:21:04 it does not help that american aircraft have horrible maneuverability at low speeds
general 2020-05-18 18:21:14 and overall sad climb rate
general 2020-05-18 18:21:27 bombers have poor bomb loads
general 2020-05-18 18:21:51 and cant even climb
general 2020-05-18 18:22:11 are slow AF
general 2020-05-18 18:22:12 while German bombers that can deal with 4 bases and an airbase can climb like a fighter
general 2020-05-18 18:23:03 yeah for some reason the gunners are better then american .50 cals
general 2020-05-18 18:23:37 Calling German bias is a salty move
general 2020-05-18 18:23:38 but
general 2020-05-18 18:23:43 German bias
general 2020-05-18 18:24:05 German steel only applies to the tanks
general 2020-05-18 18:24:16 American bombs are trash
general 2020-05-18 18:24:37 i think Gaijin is basing nations on how well they did in WWII
general 2020-05-18 18:24:52 they make germany powerful because they lost
general 2020-05-18 18:25:25 and the economy
general 2020-05-18 18:25:39 they had practically no economy late war
general 2020-05-18 18:25:53 and could not mass produce aircraft or tanks like the United States
general 2020-05-18 18:26:00 and then export tanks to the allies
general 2020-05-18 18:26:12 and aircraft
general 2020-05-18 18:26:25 not really
general 2020-05-18 18:26:41 it was WWII the essentially brought us out of the great depression
general 2020-05-18 18:26:56 then after that we were stronk
general 2020-05-18 18:27:51 the USA did not get any loans?
general 2020-05-18 18:28:10 what are you talking about
general 2020-05-18 18:28:30 donations
general 2020-05-18 18:28:50 nobody donates to a country
general 2020-05-18 18:28:57 loaning
general 2020-05-18 18:30:41 we could hold Gaijin employees at gun point demanding better balancing and they would give us some trash premium
general 2020-05-18 18:31:28 War Thunder would be a lot better if it was not run by drunk idiots without drivers license
general 2020-05-18 18:32:08 but honestly i do not understand why German Aircraft are so overpowered
general 2020-05-18 18:32:19 the can outspeed practically everything
general 2020-05-18 18:32:29 they can out dive everything
general 2020-05-18 18:32:35 or match a dive of some aircraft
general 2020-05-18 18:32:50 the have wonderful maneuverability at low speeds
general 2020-05-18 18:32:54 same with high speeds
general 2020-05-18 18:33:50 the nose mounted guns are more accurate then most aircraft guns
general 2020-05-18 18:33:57 they are very durable
general 2020-05-18 18:34:26 the cannons will break literally everything
general 2020-05-18 18:34:30 and by literally everything
general 2020-05-18 18:34:33 i am not kidding
general 2020-05-18 18:34:36 they tear
general 2020-05-18 18:34:42 planes down to the rivets
general 2020-05-18 18:35:03 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-05-18 18:35:18 German aircraft are honestly overpowered
general 2020-05-18 18:35:35 american aircraft are good at Boom and Zoom
general 2020-05-18 18:35:48 but they can only go against large targets
general 2020-05-18 18:36:31 such as bombers
general 2020-05-18 18:36:36 but that is about it
general 2020-05-18 18:37:06 All P-47s are good at that
general 2020-05-18 18:37:10 but like
general 2020-05-18 18:37:17 it has poor climb rate
general 2020-05-18 18:37:23 and everything can out run it
general 2020-05-18 18:37:35 that is why i side climb
general 2020-05-18 18:37:43 but once i find i target
general 2020-05-18 18:38:14 i practically have to kamikaze it just to kill it
general 2020-05-18 18:38:17 if i miss
general 2020-05-18 18:38:20 i am very
general 2020-05-18 18:38:21 very
general 2020-05-18 18:38:22 dead
general 2020-05-18 18:38:57 P-47 is basically left with bombers
general 2020-05-18 18:39:02 to fight
general 2020-05-18 18:39:15 and of course the germans have wonderful guns
general 2020-05-18 18:39:20 making it difficult
general 2020-05-18 18:39:38 and even bombers can outclimb the 47 with a boat load of bombs
general 2020-05-18 18:40:17 why did that look like something inappropriate
general 2020-05-18 18:40:55 the max speed of the P-47D-25 is 700 km/h
general 2020-05-18 18:41:06 but you never even reach that speed unless in a dive
general 2020-05-18 18:41:21 at the point you control surfaces lock up
general 2020-05-18 18:41:58 perhaps
general 2020-05-18 18:43:13 Tik tok is bad in my opinion
general 2020-05-18 18:43:21 except you get funny fails and such
general 2020-05-18 18:43:23 those are good
general 2020-05-18 18:47:18 does anyone ever question how a country without an economy has better aircraft then a superpower
general 2020-05-18 18:47:22 in every aspect
general 2020-05-18 18:47:59 because one can outclimb and outspeed the most power engines, and the most aerodynamic aircraft
general 2020-05-18 18:48:10 Germany versus the United States
general 2020-05-18 18:48:32 Germany has no resources other then man power
general 2020-05-18 18:48:51 the United States has basically everything but rubber
general 2020-05-18 18:49:02 which they got some
general 2020-05-18 18:49:15 synthetic rubbers
general 2020-05-18 18:49:44 before WWII everyone used natural rubbers which came from asia
general 2020-05-18 18:49:48 then a japan happened
general 2020-05-18 18:49:51 no rubber
general 2020-05-18 18:50:08 so using nearly unlimited oil
general 2020-05-18 18:50:17 and scientists with multiple PhD's
general 2020-05-18 18:50:23 we got rubber
general 2020-05-18 18:50:27 that was stronger
general 2020-05-18 18:50:32 more weather resistant
general 2020-05-18 18:50:35 and did not rot
general 2020-05-18 18:50:57 but Germany had no resources
general 2020-05-18 18:51:01 nada
general 2020-05-18 18:51:01 none
general 2020-05-18 18:51:03 nein
general 2020-05-18 18:51:53 yet Gaijin perceives that as OMG THE BEST COUNTRY OUT OF THIS OWRLD TEHNOLGO TAHASDJHD  😱 😱 😱
general 2020-05-18 18:52:13 Isreal
general 2020-05-18 18:52:28 Israel is weird
general 2020-05-18 18:52:46 Israel has the United States and Europe
general 2020-05-18 18:52:54 and tourism
general 2020-05-18 18:53:38 Israel is the weirdest
general 2020-05-18 18:53:41 and most tangled
general 2020-05-18 18:53:46 political mess ever
general 2020-05-18 18:55:13 You cannot choose sides here without massacring
general 2020-05-18 18:56:34 okay so
general 2020-05-18 18:56:38 imma go back to war thunder
general 2020-05-18 18:56:44 instead of playing correctly
general 2020-05-18 18:56:50 imma play like an idiot
general 2020-05-18 18:56:52 so
general 2020-05-18 18:57:02 I CAN ACTUALLY GET AT LEAST ON
general 2020-05-18 18:57:04 HIT

general 2020-05-19 04:48:09 soon mine will be the only one
general 2020-05-19 04:48:22 since everyone else is getting banned
general 2020-05-19 04:48:32 and the servers removed
general 2020-05-19 04:49:29 none of are interesting
general 2020-05-19 04:49:37 most are like roleplaying now
general 2020-05-19 04:49:41 others are dead
general 2020-05-19 04:50:22 im noticing a trend
general 2020-05-19 04:51:04 everyone that needs to do this
general 2020-05-19 04:51:06 just leaves
general 2020-05-19 04:51:09 like they just leave
general 2020-05-19 04:51:17 or dont even try to verify
general 2020-05-19 04:51:47 all it does it tells you to join a roblox game on the account you want verified
general 2020-05-19 04:52:11 and then boom
general 2020-05-19 04:52:23 you get verified and now you can post cancer in the meme dump
general 2020-05-19 04:52:45 but even if the bot is not working
general 2020-05-19 04:52:48 why leave?
general 2020-05-19 04:52:57 is it not worth the effort to wait
general 2020-05-19 04:53:23 because waiting is super hard and difficult
general 2020-05-19 04:53:40 if something does not happen in 0.000000001 seconds you are going to die
general 2020-05-19 04:53:50 or you will just summon the manager
general 2020-05-19 04:54:20 but no one has summoned the manager (in the sense im referring to)
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:26:16 i disagree
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:26:30 there is not much learning with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:26:34 and not much exploring
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:27:45 also i feel QSERF should be on there
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:27:51 since there is a lot of exploring
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:28:02 and some aspects of learning
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:28:21 due to the attempt at realism
general 2020-05-19 15:15:02 it appears a got portion of scam bots have been banned
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:16:53 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:16:57 no no
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:17:02 outlines have been removed
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:17:05 :((((((
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:17:28 why would roblox even remove outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:18:10 Roblox is determined to Ruin Imagination™️
general 2020-05-19 15:18:44 that is a weird car
general 2020-05-19 15:18:52 but that belongs in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:20:57 found an old server

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:21:47 Marine_Savoic
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:21:49 actually
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:21:53 im on an alt
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:22:14 i think it might look better with some blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:22:17 having no outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:22:23 such as sad or grass
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:22:52 we are now going to need to get better at coloring
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:22:56 and shading
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:23:08 to make up for the lack of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:23:56 i like lost all blood flow to my left leg
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:24:00 becuase my cat was sitting on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:24:50 he is a heavy boy
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:26:26 one day David Bazucki is going to be shot
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:26:33 one day
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:26:41 either by someone looking for money
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:26:57 or someone made about how he treats roblox and its community
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:28:25 we just have to get creative with coloring
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:28:34 make up for the lack of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:31:11 coloring is going to be more important
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:32:38 the only issue is how are we going to adapt our current builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:37:46 i would say it looks somewhat better
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:39:42 using default texture does not help
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:39:46 since default texture
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:39:51 is literally plastic texture
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:42:10 this is a time where coloring and finer block placement is important and almost required
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:43:01 its going to take more effort to make builds look nicer
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:50:15 imagine using plastic material
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:50:20 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:50:48 i use proper materials naturally
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:50:53 so this is not an issue
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:53:20 were custom outlines a bust?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 15:56:28 alts of bots <:pogey:651848693842182144>

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:00:47 the Dev Forum like this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:00:51 people like this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:01:03 even the ones that it does not affect
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:01:53 do you english?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:02:14 roblox?

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:02:50 oh so
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:03:06 supposedly there is way to keep outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:04:08 so not all is lost
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:04:16 rickje just needs to see this
bot-central 2020-05-19 16:11:08 !rank
general 2020-05-19 16:20:21 do you ever just sparta kick random baby trees
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 16:24:59 
general 2020-05-19 18:08:32 No trolling
general 2020-05-19 18:08:35 No F
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:13:01 oh i just noticed the new system
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:13:07 for creations
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:13:19 and such
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:13:56 <:LagBomb:568630816121290753>
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:16:40 report him to roblox saying he insulted the moderation system
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:16:44 get him IP banned
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:16:58 because <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:19:28 its helps not to actually use plastic when building
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:19:44 the default material is literally plastic
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:25:54 actually there is a way
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:25:59 outlines were not removed
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:26:05 the system was just changed
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:27:17 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/deprecating-outlines/291969
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:27:29 rickje needs to see this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:27:43 i would DM but i think he closed his DM's
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:28:10 then why is there a DevForum post?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:29:12 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:29:28 at least it might make the game smoother
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:29:49 its called dont use plastic/default material
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:29:55 and use more detail
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:29:57 and coloring
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:33:20 that looks more realistic since runways dont have outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:33:38 not really
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:34:21 rickje needs to add all base roblox materials
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:34:38 most
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:35:03 you can do that with glass
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:35:59 says the person who made plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:36:20 madattak is a huge bruh tbh
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:36:57 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:37:08 he probably has it at the bottom of the server list
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:37:20 or in a folder of servers he never visits
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:37:54 yeah rick could do that for some materials
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:38:00 like metal and such
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:38:10 the materials that look worse with one single color
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:38:23 but then it would be ruined once you painted over
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:38:34 unless rick applies it to that
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:39:26 but you also had this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:39:40 for outlines being enabled
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:39:54 i can see why roblox would remove it
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:40:59 Roblox honestly had good intentions with this one
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:41:07 and they had good communication
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:41:18 something that literally never happens
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:42:26 25000 < 7325800
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:42:37 that is quite a difference
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:43:43 that is less then 5% of games
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:43:47 if i did my math correctly
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:44:12 tbh is honestly was no where near worth it for roblox to maintain it
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:44:44 since plane crazy is the only game with outlines to maintain over 1000 consecutive plays
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:45:14 but occasionally breaches 5000
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:46:49 i dont like the removal of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:47:02 but honestly im with roblox on this one
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:47:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:47:40 that is usually how it works
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:51:11 roblox says it should
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:04:33 hold up
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:04:44 
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:04:53 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:04:56 rick
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:04:57 why
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:05:02 WHY
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:05:07 did you change pontoons
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:05:28 ugly
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:05:30 look at this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:05:38 why
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:17:18 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:17:20 rick
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:17:21 why
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:17:23 why why why
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:27:57 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:28:26 coloring also helps
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:35:05 
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:37:29 im not a big fan of world of warships
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:37:33 pretty game
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:37:43 but i dont like the gameplay
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:38:26 i like War Thunder mainly because it is mostly skill based
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:38:52 with a dash of luck
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:39:06 the only issue is you go through underwear quite quickly
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:06 i want to know
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:11 what is with the siren head trend
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:18 it is all youtube recommends me
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:23 stuff about siren head
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:29 those are most the memes im seeing
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:37 so many people are building siren head
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:43 honestly what is the deal
general 2020-05-19 20:37:16 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:38:02 Your computer has run into an error
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:40:23 no im his enemy
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:40:49 rick did you ever touch pontoons?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:41:08 specifically the 1x1 sizes
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:41:54 because why?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:42:18 its like a half cutter block
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:42:33 with smoothed edges
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:42:51 its spikey and it looks horrible
general 2020-05-19 20:43:34 maybe blocks could be highlighted if you hover over them with your mouse
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:59:54 at that angle it would look nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:59:59 the bottom one
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:00:06 the low poly textures
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:00:13 if the ship were completed
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:00:17 both actually
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:00:37 yeah bridge is meh
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:02 minecraft concrete
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:07 hmmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:14 the one block i dont use
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:19 well sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:31 i use a lot of blocks for building
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:19:40 but not really concret
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:20:36 hof fame builds are dead
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:20:39 most of them are
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:20:42 deleted
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:20:45 or corrupted
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:27:53 so
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:28:10 if im being honest
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:28:46 im kind of excited for the removal of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:28:49 no idea how
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:28:52 or why
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:29:30 but i see potential
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:32:23 so far it has helped me by spotting color differences between materials
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:34:04 this was the color difference between ice and metal that i never spotted before
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:34:30 dont ask why the turret was mostly ice

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:59:16 i figured out box folds on my own
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:59:24 over years of research
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:59:34 and you are telling me there was a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 23:00:04 no i found out before the video was made
the-dump 2020-05-20 03:39:00 hmmm yes
the-dump 2020-05-20 03:39:42 not good meme

general 2020-05-20 03:41:07 dont furries just speak their native language
general 2020-05-20 03:41:26 Like english, japanese, communist, german
general 2020-05-20 03:41:29 and what not
general 2020-05-20 03:42:11 i have not heard a furry say meow unless somebody was about to be murdered
general 2020-05-20 03:42:56 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-05-20 03:43:13 tbh sometimes i forget creativ was mod
general 2020-05-20 03:43:24 cause i dont remember him doing much
general 2020-05-20 03:45:54 or could be alt
general 2020-05-20 03:47:13 my mouse was sticking to the mouse pad
general 2020-05-20 03:47:20 so i lifted it up
general 2020-05-20 03:47:25 rubbed it
general 2020-05-20 03:47:36 and now its like trying to walk on ice with snow boats
general 2020-05-20 03:47:38 it just
general 2020-05-20 03:47:43 *s l i d e s*
general 2020-05-20 03:49:23 Pro tip: Snow boots are made for snow, not ice. For walking on ice wear shoes with small, or no treads, and take small strides.
general 2020-05-20 03:49:37 Follow that and you should survive a northern winter
the-dump 2020-05-20 03:50:03 I have never been warned
the-dump 2020-05-20 03:50:21 being here since 2018

general 2020-05-20 03:52:22 me and aero got along
general 2020-05-20 03:52:29 same with me and vixo
general 2020-05-20 03:53:03 both of which got permed
general 2020-05-20 03:53:11 cool
general 2020-05-20 03:59:29 im like meh with the outlines
general 2020-05-20 03:59:41 i dont like their removal
general 2020-05-20 03:59:47 but at the same time im excited
general 2020-05-20 04:00:51 Actually
general 2020-05-20 04:00:55 in all honesty
general 2020-05-20 04:01:08 roblox did actually do something good
general 2020-05-20 04:01:42 they took the roblox community into consideration
general 2020-05-20 04:01:51 they communicated for once
general 2020-05-20 04:02:08 and they actually had a reason for it
general 2020-05-20 04:02:15 forget what it was

general 2020-05-20 04:03:23 the latter was a year ago
general 2020-05-20 04:21:21 roblox removed outlines
general 2020-05-20 04:22:24 get dynoed
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:26:09 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-05-20 04:34:13 haha tank go pew
general 2020-05-20 04:39:10 then plane crazy would be pay to win almost
general 2020-05-20 05:25:27 hmm so i finally figured out why im so bad at war thunder tank RB
general 2020-05-20 05:25:47 its because im uptiered so often
general 2020-05-20 05:25:52 to the point where i can barely play
general 2020-05-20 05:26:03 and the germans get paired with the soviets so often
general 2020-05-20 05:26:11 its makes it nearly impossible
general 2020-05-20 05:27:24 chonky sparkler
general 2020-05-20 05:31:04 yeah i swear
general 2020-05-20 05:31:11 im literally
general 2020-05-20 05:31:13 trapped
general 2020-05-20 05:31:16 chained to wall
general 2020-05-20 05:31:23 spiked chains infact
general 2020-05-20 05:31:33 so moving is painful
general 2020-05-20 05:31:56 im chained to a wall that is War Thunder BR 4.7
general 2020-05-20 05:32:53 im just not even going to play any tanks anymore
general 2020-05-20 05:32:56 since like
general 2020-05-20 05:33:15 USA
general 2020-05-20 05:33:26 the tanks loved for bouncing shells
general 2020-05-20 05:34:21 well here is the thing
general 2020-05-20 05:34:23 i cannot
general 2020-05-20 05:34:25 research
general 2020-05-20 05:34:31 the Jumbo
general 2020-05-20 05:34:46 i have that
general 2020-05-20 05:35:05 its cost quite a bit of RP
general 2020-05-20 05:35:10 but that is not the issue
general 2020-05-20 05:35:38 the issue is the fact i am uptiered to the point of near impossible gameplay
general 2020-05-20 05:36:00 once i join a match
general 2020-05-20 05:36:09 its basically done for me
general 2020-05-20 05:40:24 i could research the jumbo but that leaves my second best tank at br 4.0
general 2020-05-20 05:40:54 M4A2
general 2020-05-20 05:41:42 im more then halfway through researching it
general 2020-05-20 05:42:23 my last match i had about 5 tanks trying to shoot at me through a building
general 2020-05-20 05:42:45 until once finally killed me by glancing the treads
general 2020-05-20 05:49:55 lovely
general 2020-05-20 05:50:01 so
general 2020-05-20 05:50:04 im already out
general 2020-05-20 05:50:06 because
general 2020-05-20 05:50:18 i tried to defend from spawn campers
general 2020-05-20 05:50:30 and got sniped from literally across the entire map
general 2020-05-20 05:51:05 no im playing go lay in a muddy hole simulator 2020
general 2020-05-20 05:51:17 it is
general 2020-05-20 05:51:25 its also free
general 2020-05-20 05:51:37 war thunder
general 2020-05-20 05:51:48 yes
general 2020-05-20 05:52:21 i have 400 hours of playtime
general 2020-05-20 05:52:26 and like
general 2020-05-20 05:52:45 i have no idea what i am doing cause i have no chance to even learn
general 2020-05-20 05:53:07 the only thing i know how to do
general 2020-05-20 05:53:08 is die
general 2020-05-20 05:53:10 die
general 2020-05-20 05:53:13 freaking die
general 2020-05-20 05:53:15 and suffer
general 2020-05-20 05:53:30 i have good eyes
general 2020-05-20 05:53:34 i can see tanks
general 2020-05-20 05:54:10 probably because i get out skilled by people with 10000 hours of playtime
general 2020-05-20 05:54:41 no i just get shot literally through several buildings
general 2020-05-20 05:54:42 no joke
general 2020-05-20 05:54:47 i literally get shot
general 2020-05-20 05:54:54 through several meters of concrete
general 2020-05-20 05:55:01 no
general 2020-05-20 05:55:05 i literally get shot
general 2020-05-20 05:55:10 through several meters of concrete
general 2020-05-20 05:56:00 it is just concrete
general 2020-05-20 05:56:31 no
general 2020-05-20 05:56:38 the walls can survive nuclear blasts
general 2020-05-20 06:03:20 no one randomly shoots at a wall
general 2020-05-20 06:03:33 unless to load a different shell
general 2020-05-20 06:03:53 or in some cases baiting
general 2020-05-20 06:04:12 but there have been cases where it was literally impossible
general 2020-05-20 06:04:20 because of the viewing angle
general 2020-05-20 06:04:25 and many buildings
general 2020-05-20 06:05:09 however this im used to by now
general 2020-05-20 06:05:25 3 spawn campers
general 2020-05-20 06:05:56 because i always get paired with newer players like me
general 2020-05-20 06:06:07 and are forced to go against skilled players
general 2020-05-20 06:06:19 usually in russian tanks so they have that advantage
general 2020-05-20 06:06:46 the one nation i struggle fighting
general 2020-05-20 06:06:49 along with germany
general 2020-05-20 06:06:51 and japan
general 2020-05-20 06:06:59 the ones that always are put together
general 2020-05-20 06:09:18 whenever i get to play with the soviets i get so excited
general 2020-05-20 06:09:30 because well i never get to play with soviet tanks
general 2020-05-20 06:09:43 and at least my team has a chance of winning
general 2020-05-20 06:14:27 sometimes tanks will not even render until i get killed or they get killed
general 2020-05-20 06:14:33 i have had that issue sometimes
the-dump 2020-05-20 15:25:18 i saw the gnome literally right away
the-dump 2020-05-20 15:25:30 i didnt even have to look that hard
the-dump 2020-05-20 15:25:38 heck
the-dump 2020-05-20 15:25:46 i didnt even look to see it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:26 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:36 block reflectivity only works with glass
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:39 and maybe foil
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:34:04 and all it literally does is reflect the sky
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:34:52 block reflectivity does not affect materials like wood, metal, plastics, or any solids like that
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:12 you would need to create your own chrome material
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:35:32 i have never been able to do it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:36:11 i have never observed a major change in material appearance by changing reflectivity
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:36:57 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:36:58 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:05 i need to check this for myself
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:47 <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:37:58 its updating
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:16 
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:20 bright
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:40:37 pixelated lava
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:41:19 how would it look with the neon material
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:42:14 well this was started by adding a feature that could change block reflectivity in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:42:20 to make chrome
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:42:29 i did not believe it could be done
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:42:53 and xyn is showing me it can
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:43:03 so this is a plane crazy related conversation
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:44:18 chrome
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:44:22 that would look really nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:46:01 yeah the reflectance of metal does not change
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:47:55 yeah its only plastic and glass that are affected
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:54:34 cuz metal stronk
general 2020-05-20 15:55:27 why doesnt the improved rickje develop plane crazy
general 2020-05-20 15:58:14 [:
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:58:53 there is no issue
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:59:13 just a blind man and a body hanging  from the ceiling
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 16:01:34 fart
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 16:02:27 imagine being flexable
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 16:02:56 tink tonk
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 16:03:25 imagine curvy tank
general 2020-05-20 16:18:47 im having yogurt
general 2020-05-20 16:18:52 dairy
general 2020-05-20 16:18:55 myes
general 2020-05-20 16:19:07 *** D A I R Y ***
general 2020-05-20 16:27:37 yes
general 2020-05-20 16:27:50 and they did
general 2020-05-20 16:28:43 that is like less then 5%
general 2020-05-20 16:28:50 of games
general 2020-05-20 16:29:01 made on roblox
general 2020-05-20 16:29:11 thye thought about it
general 2020-05-20 16:29:14 they communicated
general 2020-05-20 16:29:48 they gave a one year notice
general 2020-05-20 16:30:06 1% of games use outlines
general 2020-05-20 16:30:14 and they explained why they were going to remove it
general 2020-05-20 16:31:35 yes because 1% of games that nobody really plays are more important then 99% of other games
general 2020-05-20 16:32:07 the 99% of games that do not use outlines
general 2020-05-20 16:32:22 well there is a table
general 2020-05-20 16:32:30 showing how many games use outlines
general 2020-05-20 16:32:35 and those that do not
general 2020-05-20 16:33:55 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/removing-outlines/504226
general 2020-05-20 16:34:06 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/deprecating-outlines/291969
general 2020-05-20 16:35:17 Plane Crazy and supposedly Borderlands are the only major games affected
general 2020-05-20 16:35:47 When Roblox introduced it
general 2020-05-20 16:35:53 they forced all games to use outlines
general 2020-05-20 16:35:58 this created many issues
general 2020-05-20 16:36:06 so made it an option to disable them
general 2020-05-20 16:36:15 but everybody basically disabled them
general 2020-05-20 16:36:51 
general 2020-05-20 16:37:01 it was also causing present issues
general 2020-05-20 16:37:18 by the looks of it
general 2020-05-20 16:37:32 the outlines might have been what was holding roblox back
general 2020-05-20 16:37:39 on making other improvements
general 2020-05-20 16:39:07 
general 2020-05-20 16:39:11 it was holding roblox back
general 2020-05-20 16:39:15 the outlines
general 2020-05-20 16:39:19 were like a roadblock
general 2020-05-20 16:40:31 Roblox had good intentions in this one
general 2020-05-20 16:40:36 I dont like that outlines were removed
general 2020-05-20 16:40:45 but im with Roblox on this decision
general 2020-05-20 16:57:15 h
general 2020-05-20 16:57:24 TV yes
general 2020-05-20 16:57:37 you can watch the cartoons
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:11:06 or you could just make an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:11:13 that is an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:11:16 but without planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:11:26 and catapult if its a modern carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:12:27 <@456226577798135808> first of all what aircraft carrier are you making
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:13:05 no it actually difficult to get planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:13:20 only view people made aircraft carriers that came with planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:13:26 and those were smaller design
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:13:33 with small toy planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:15:38 i dont build much
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:15:45 i have made 5 ships
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:15:58 i have one completed
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:16:04 and 1 wip
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:16:08 the other 3 are dead
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:16:30 mine it 6k
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:16:57 i was thinking getting it done at around 8k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:17:21 but it will likely be more too make up with detail and the loss of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:17:45 ehh
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:17:55 puri haas arrived
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:18:02 moc is about to be stomped on
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:18:34 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/641020073439395842
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:18:38 low effort carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:19:56 this was my only aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:19:58 i gave up on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:20:10 and built this
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:20:38 i dont like the smoke stack
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:20:46 i should go back to that ship and move it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:20:51 too far back
the-dump 2020-05-20 18:25:16 its cows tumbling out of a truck that crashed in reverse
the-dump 2020-05-20 18:25:38 those cows are probably dead that point
the-dump 2020-05-20 18:25:53 since large animals like that can barely heal from broken bones
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:27:24 np
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:27:28 unde turrets
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:28:00 it also could depend on who you are fighting
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:28:49 if you are fighting Paradian battleships, battlecruisers, and heavy cruisers, then it submarines with torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:28:58 or an army of torpedo bombers
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:29:51 that is like any time a paradian aircraft carrier shows u
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:30:03 but the carrier is the plane in this instance
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:32:12 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
the-dump 2020-05-20 18:32:44 NSFL though
the-dump 2020-05-20 18:32:47 is illegal
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:33:00 well yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:33:10 it stopped him from spamming
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:33:15 wow
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:33:25 muting someone has never stopped them from spamming
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 18:33:31 oh you did ?purge

the-dump 2020-05-20 20:05:05 do you ever just baba booey
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:25:25 7086 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:29:13 usually i say all my builds are bad so im willing to improve
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:29:24 but honestly i really like it
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:29:37 needs a lot of work around the aft
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:30:20 curvy squares
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:39:43 custom
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:48:10 hopefully he makes it an option
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:48:29 cause having no outlines is actually helping me
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:50:30 yeah the color randomizer should also be toggable
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:50:40 cause is some cases you wnat a solid color
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:51:42 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:51:50 the poopoo server
general 2020-05-20 21:05:02 im still convinced katze was caught on youtube

general 2020-05-20 21:06:09 <@!349710938607452160> you would not want to know

plane-crazy 2020-05-21 03:21:46 what ships?
general 2020-05-21 03:25:13 i had to explain to a person how an economy works

general 2020-05-21 03:29:50 the only game with no chat filter
general 2020-05-21 03:40:38 Lumber Tycoon 2 is also a building game
general 2020-05-21 03:41:03 not just a wood game
general 2020-05-21 03:41:23 plane crazy is basically docile 2b2t
general 2020-05-21 03:42:06 and technically lumber tycoon 2 is an infinite block
general 2020-05-21 03:42:28 yeah
general 2020-05-21 03:42:56 good luck getting madattak to agree
general 2020-05-21 03:43:47 steve you might get warned for filter bypassing

general 2020-05-21 03:45:15 and that will never happen

general 2020-05-21 03:48:12 i know nothing in any coding language
general 2020-05-21 03:48:17 i tried with Lua
general 2020-05-21 03:49:12 i cannot absorb any information to know how to code
general 2020-05-21 03:50:25 the only thing i am good at is landscaping
general 2020-05-21 03:50:36 but i dont even do that most the time
general 2020-05-21 03:51:17 the most original game ever
general 2020-05-21 03:57:40 yes

general 2020-05-21 04:14:53 while you sleep

general 2020-05-21 04:15:34 yeah
general 2020-05-21 04:16:22 when you call them weeds
general 2020-05-21 04:16:28 all of sudden they are not bad
general 2020-05-21 04:16:46 but that could be because i live in wisconsin
general 2020-05-21 04:17:45 with bull thistles as big as cars, ragweed as tall as houses, weird onion thingy that gives you a permanent allergic reaction to the sun
general 2020-05-21 04:18:57 imagine this
general 2020-05-21 04:19:08 but as big as your car
general 2020-05-21 04:20:23 no it is healthy
general 2020-05-21 04:21:28 this is what we deal with
general 2020-05-21 04:23:06 If you ever move to Wisconsin and do not want to manage weeds
general 2020-05-21 04:23:26 move to Milwaukee where not even your children can grow
general 2020-05-21 04:24:01 im something
general 2020-05-21 04:25:49 the games i dont have an interest in are always free
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:27:28 im having no issues
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:27:36 with the removal of outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:27:46 it is actually making it easier for me
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:27:49 tbh
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:28:06 honestly i dont know how
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 04:28:11 i just find it easier to build

general 2020-05-21 04:43:09 nobody under the age of 13 is allowed here
general 2020-05-21 04:43:21 because ToS

general 2020-05-21 15:33:47 why am i getting ghost pinged so much
general 2020-05-21 15:34:24 Also we have thunderstorms in the forecast for a week straight
general 2020-05-21 15:34:26 uuum
general 2020-05-21 15:34:37 ***nervous sweating***
general 2020-05-21 15:43:19 the last we had thunderstorms for a week
general 2020-05-21 15:43:30 dams were completely destroyed
general 2020-05-21 15:43:36 and many farms were flattened
general 2020-05-21 15:44:49 Neither of the students understood.
general 2020-05-21 15:45:56 Both those sentences are hard to say
general 2020-05-21 15:46:26 both dont sound right both said out loud and in my head
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 17:41:13 <@!641041522090967104> i had to repaint a majority of my ship
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 17:41:30 and redo the deck to make it look good with no outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 17:41:59 also you ship reminds me of those old Galaxy ships
the-dump 2020-05-21 17:44:10 hippity hoppity
the-dump 2020-05-21 17:44:16 what happened to Voxel's proprty
the-dump 2020-05-21 18:38:19 i got knifes if you need any
the-dump 2020-05-21 18:38:31 chop rickje up into little bits
general 2020-05-21 18:42:41 cool
general 2020-05-21 18:42:45 what kind of engine
general 2020-05-21 18:47:49 yeah i think that is a new engine
general 2020-05-21 18:47:59 i have never heard of it
general 2020-05-21 18:48:12 maybe because it is not at all speedy
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:17:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:21:19 take a motor2 and enable servo
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:21:24 and set an angle limiter
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:21:43 and keybind it how you want to
general 2020-05-21 20:06:54 bah
general 2020-05-21 20:07:00 ew
general 2020-05-21 20:07:00 suspension
general 2020-05-21 20:07:45 gross
general 2020-05-21 20:07:46 stinky
general 2020-05-21 20:07:53 stank
the-dump 2020-05-21 20:40:29 maybe
general 2020-05-21 20:51:11 yummy food
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 20:55:51 boats will always tilt when turning
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 20:56:22 the best you can do is put pontoons (if you have them) along the water line inside the hull, or outside depending on the ship
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 20:56:32 and put helium at the tallest points
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 20:57:02 but that probably wont even help since i cannot get a warship to stay upright
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 20:57:32 despite the helium in the superstructure, the pontoons in the hull, and the hull design
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 21:03:47 it applies the lift to the Center of Mass
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 21:04:08 which i dont think is a good idea for folding builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 21:04:24 since the CoM changes and i assume the lift does not change with it
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 21:48:16 Tigor

general 2020-05-24 17:32:41 but it absorbs shots
general 2020-05-24 17:32:47 and a lot of them hurt
general 2020-05-24 17:33:41 American find that the best way to survive is to not die
general 2020-05-24 17:33:49 also being quiet helps
general 2020-05-24 17:33:52 *Gaijin*
general 2020-05-24 17:34:23 Sherman Jumbo moment

general 2020-05-24 17:37:52 or you could just call the tanks by their nicknames
general 2020-05-24 17:40:47 at least it is not like Germany with their Jagdpanzer, Flakpanzers, Waffentrager, Beglietpanzer and whatever Sd.Kfz stands for
general 2020-05-24 17:41:18 bonus points if you can pronounce them correctly
general 2020-05-24 17:41:53 also notice that Sweden plays with the Axis in tank RB and the Allies in air RB

general 2020-05-24 17:43:09 but why does
general 2020-05-24 17:43:22 Sweden get the allies in the air and Germany on the ground
general 2020-05-24 17:44:09 also i dont understand USA against the Soviet union in early tiers
general 2020-05-24 17:44:16 where it is WWII tanks
general 2020-05-24 17:44:20 not cold war tanks
general 2020-05-24 17:45:11 but like tier I and II that is purely WWII tanks all across the board except for the R3 T20
general 2020-05-24 17:56:28 oh btw two new american fighter jets coming to war thunder
general 2020-05-24 17:56:38 plus one italian boi

general 2020-05-24 19:40:23 what about it
general 2020-05-24 19:40:43 you mean the relative lack of cancer?
general 2020-05-24 19:40:53 as compared to last year
general 2020-05-24 19:41:10 no last year was horrible
general 2020-05-24 19:41:33 that
general 2020-05-24 19:41:37 is not new
general 2020-05-24 19:41:47 how are you just noticing?
general 2020-05-24 19:42:07 i guess like to dislike ratio
general 2020-05-24 19:42:10 or favorites
general 2020-05-24 19:42:17 ratio of plays to favoriting
general 2020-05-24 19:44:32 the highest upvotes in players love that i see right away is Welcome to Bloxburg
general 2020-05-24 19:44:50 with 94% likes
general 2020-05-24 19:45:32 it might be the ratio of plays to favorites
general 2020-05-24 19:46:05 or maybe how often a single player will come back to the game
general 2020-05-24 19:47:12 tower of hell has that low of a dislike to likes ratio because salty children
general 2020-05-24 19:48:20 also i like how you can pick out a low quality game if it has Denis in the thumbnails, advertisement, or game icon
general 2020-05-24 19:51:52 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 19:58:59 once i complete the aft fire control and radar tower on my ship it is practically done
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 19:59:22 though i still will spend a long time on detailing because it can never have enough
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 19:59:38 also max torque is basically the power of a motor

general 2020-05-24 20:24:07 it does not help madattak will not help
general 2020-05-24 20:24:16 or allow in game moderators
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:29:16 i keep having this 7x7 beam spawn there with the same color as the hull
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:29:46 i used to have a similar issue where a block would spawn in the center of the build
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:29:49 with no color
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:30:07 but now i have a 7x7 beam spawning inside the hull at an angle with the same color as the hull
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:32:20 there are these two beams here that are not attached to anything, why they are there i have no clue, but the one on the left does not spawn in correctly
bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:32:47 
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:41:06 i dont wanna do the rigging but i got to do the rigging
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:42:32 vip3
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:54:35 rockets travel in a straight line
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:54:41 and follow when they get close
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:54:53 you need to lead the aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:55:11 aim at the area where you think the aircraft will be when the rockets intersect
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 20:55:59 basically what i just said
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:09:30 something with a jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:16:06 i wish rickje could make it so we could take ropes and string it across to different blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:16:21 like the rope constraint feature in studio
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:16:35 which is what the rope block uses
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:25:06 do blocks weld to the top part of conveyor blocks?
general 2020-05-24 21:30:37 what?
general 2020-05-24 21:32:48 <@!684581451408080902> that is worse then ramming
general 2020-05-24 21:33:39 join a different server
general 2020-05-24 21:33:47 or ask him to stop
general 2020-05-24 21:33:48 kindly
general 2020-05-24 21:34:05 yes blacklist helps
general 2020-05-24 21:35:26 you can manually join a different server
general 2020-05-24 21:35:32 one that he is not in
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 21:36:31 yay i finally got it
general 2020-05-24 21:38:59 yes
general 2020-05-24 21:39:33 if you are one PC it is below the badges
general 2020-05-24 21:39:53 
general 2020-05-24 21:40:13 on mobile it should also be in the same spot below the game and badges
the-dump 2020-05-25 03:48:29 i am asking the same thing
general 2020-05-25 03:50:42 that is tehnoob1233
general 2020-05-25 03:51:02 me niether
general 2020-05-25 04:18:28 why are we reporting battleship?
general 2020-05-25 04:24:05 🚙 **h**
general 2020-05-25 04:25:22 fun while it lasted
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 04:44:32 who needs FPS
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 04:45:33 that room would look better without outlines
general 2020-05-25 04:47:35 yo
general 2020-05-25 04:47:40 i just made myself sad
general 2020-05-25 04:48:35 maybe im not bad at war thunder
general 2020-05-25 04:48:42 maybe war thunder is bad wat war thunder
general 2020-05-25 04:48:50 cause when i first played
general 2020-05-25 04:49:03 i was honestly a natural
general 2020-05-25 04:49:11 but as more update and patches rolled out
general 2020-05-25 04:49:21 and i slowly unlocked new vehicles
general 2020-05-25 04:49:37 it seemed my skills diminished
general 2020-05-25 04:49:44 but now as i look back at it
general 2020-05-25 04:50:13 i realize Gaijin is just a poopoo
general 2020-05-25 04:50:46 so im still good but i fall victim to bad matchmaking
general 2020-05-25 04:50:48 which tbh
general 2020-05-25 04:50:59 with good matchmaking i am really good
general 2020-05-25 04:51:28 but im always uptiered and placed in un balanced games where the enemy has more skill
general 2020-05-25 04:51:39 and im stuck with generally new players
general 2020-05-25 04:51:49 and still up tiered
general 2020-05-25 04:52:32 the heck is luck?
general 2020-05-25 04:52:47 <@!448505589983739914> explain
general 2020-05-25 04:52:48 what is luck
general 2020-05-25 04:52:53 i have never heard of such thing
general 2020-05-25 04:53:16 interesting
general 2020-05-25 04:53:20 where do i get this luck
general 2020-05-25 04:53:32 or how do i summon it
general 2020-05-25 04:53:39 or at least encourage its presence
general 2020-05-25 04:54:59 first of all why is this in my recommended
general 2020-05-25 04:55:07 who is locus
general 2020-05-25 04:55:15 why the thumbnail
general 2020-05-25 04:55:23 i have not played that game in years
general 2020-05-25 04:55:45 also whoever runs the channel has a face cam
general 2020-05-25 04:55:56 and in the preview it shows an 8 year old boy
general 2020-05-25 04:56:06 and since when do planes float in that game?
general 2020-05-25 04:57:16 also why is this in my recommended
general 2020-05-25 04:57:21 i dont care about north korea
general 2020-05-25 04:58:01 also who is vice
general 2020-05-25 04:58:36 and this is just capitalist propaganda
general 2020-05-25 04:59:30 we got an "ok" moment
general 2020-05-25 05:00:10 though if used in the meme format
general 2020-05-25 05:00:14 it would make sense
general 2020-05-25 05:00:36 once again i be time travelling
general 2020-05-25 05:00:51 i cannot view my gyazo gifs because i need to pay for all them
general 2020-05-25 05:01:36 Gyazo was confirmed american company when they made you pay to see the gifs you took
general 2020-05-25 05:03:31 imagine still using gyazo though
general 2020-05-25 05:05:51 https://gyazo.com/06a97a9e53f6278f599b377d3bb2288c
general 2020-05-25 05:06:10 this is a gif of my first gif since i cannot get the link for it without paying first
general 2020-05-25 05:08:06 gyazo literally only lets you view your last 10 gifs
general 2020-05-25 05:08:20 i remember when they let you view all you made
general 2020-05-25 05:08:42 gyazo is gay though
general 2020-05-25 05:10:21 
general 2020-05-25 05:10:26 oh yeah cool
general 2020-05-25 05:10:31 that works
general 2020-05-25 05:11:22 imagine building with diamond blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 05:12:10 imagine needing outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 05:12:16 to make nice ship
general 2020-05-25 05:14:16 myes
general 2020-05-25 05:14:21 Mojang Studios
general 2020-05-25 05:14:33 wut
general 2020-05-25 05:14:36 turbine engine
general 2020-05-25 05:14:54 what
general 2020-05-25 05:15:24 are you referring to Gaijin and their turbine engines
general 2020-05-25 05:15:26 that are like
general 2020-05-25 05:15:29 earbleed
general 2020-05-25 05:15:37 like Wyvern
general 2020-05-25 05:15:43 yes
general 2020-05-25 05:15:56 It was almost fun™️
general 2020-05-25 05:16:23 war thunder could be funz
general 2020-05-25 05:16:26 but like
general 2020-05-25 05:16:38 Gaijin are big drunk quacks
general 2020-05-25 05:17:18 some tanks are not rendered
general 2020-05-25 05:17:26 dead planes can still fly
general 2020-05-25 05:17:29 and can kill
general 2020-05-25 05:18:03 German He 109 is overperforming
general 2020-05-25 05:18:11 even without plane
general 2020-05-25 05:18:33 i flew a P-63 with 40% of the wings gone
general 2020-05-25 05:19:02 somebody here got a screenshot of me doing it
general 2020-05-25 05:19:05 but they were banned
general 2020-05-25 05:19:08 possibly permed
general 2020-05-25 05:19:29 ground is cancer
general 2020-05-25 05:19:32 so is air
general 2020-05-25 05:19:44 naval is war crime simulator
general 2020-05-25 05:19:50 simulator is wonk
general 2020-05-25 05:20:10 naval battles are fun until matchmaking happens
general 2020-05-25 05:20:29 also tier II grind takes longer to grind then entire nations
general 2020-05-25 05:21:19 A patrol boat at tier II costs more then a heavy cruiser
general 2020-05-25 05:21:38 because Gaijin is best game studio ever
general 2020-05-25 05:22:17 Jagdpanzers will bounce literally any shell at basically any angle
general 2020-05-25 05:22:33 and it will pen basically everything else
general 2020-05-25 05:23:21 the same reason the americans get 50 millimeters of extra pen for an extra millimeter of barrel
general 2020-05-25 05:23:36 because screw balancing
general 2020-05-25 05:23:37 balancing is for nerds
general 2020-05-25 05:24:12 americans only do good when playing at the tanks BR or lower
general 2020-05-25 05:24:17 anything above is like
general 2020-05-25 05:24:18 saoidusepfsgrdc
general 2020-05-25 05:24:41 haha tank go
general 2020-05-25 05:24:47 https://tenor.com/view/destory-eexplode-nuke-gif-6073338
general 2020-05-25 05:26:30 
general 2020-05-25 05:26:51 imagine R3 T20
general 2020-05-25 05:27:03 1980's vehicle
general 2020-05-25 05:27:11 fighting in WWII
general 2020-05-25 05:27:15 very realistic
general 2020-05-25 05:28:39 meanwhile in a naval RB match
general 2020-05-25 05:29:01 because gaijin
general 2020-05-25 05:29:10 remember who makes war thunder
general 2020-05-25 05:29:17 if something is not right
general 2020-05-25 05:29:21 blame it on gaijin
general 2020-05-25 05:29:38 becuase there is a !123456787654321% chance it is their fault
general 2020-05-25 05:30:06 Calliope is just a sherman but worse at hiding
general 2020-05-25 05:30:40 also im noticing barely anyone is playing high tiers
general 2020-05-25 05:30:45 everybody is lows tiers
general 2020-05-25 05:31:03 name one thing about war thunder that is not gay
general 2020-05-25 05:31:27 <@!287779983445721088> same
general 2020-05-25 05:31:36 just bring a locust
general 2020-05-25 05:31:43 you are small
general 2020-05-25 05:31:44 nimble
general 2020-05-25 05:31:47 nimble
general 2020-05-25 05:31:52 *fast*
general 2020-05-25 05:32:10 and your gun pens everything if you shoot the right spot
general 2020-05-25 05:32:59 i like how i asked someone to tell me something not gay in war thunder
general 2020-05-25 05:33:02 and i got no response
general 2020-05-25 05:33:26 no that is gay
general 2020-05-25 05:33:55 Russian bias is only good if you are playing as a russian
general 2020-05-25 05:34:21 in which case no need for bias since you have like freaking good tanks at any BR
general 2020-05-25 05:34:30 and i bought an account
general 2020-05-25 05:34:38 for $0.00
general 2020-05-25 05:34:46 including a tax of $0.00
general 2020-05-25 05:35:54 also having friends to play with and a mic so you can voice chat helps
general 2020-05-25 05:36:00 also being a youtuber helps
general 2020-05-25 05:36:10 because gaijin will give you every vehicle
general 2020-05-25 05:36:16 and make you basically invisible
general 2020-05-25 05:36:22 and make everyone else visible
general 2020-05-25 05:36:24 while i
general 2020-05-25 05:36:29 i get a freaking
general 2020-05-25 05:36:36 las vegas approved
general 2020-05-25 05:36:39 bill board
general 2020-05-25 05:36:46 strapped to my back
general 2020-05-25 05:37:02 with automated landing assist
general 2020-05-25 05:37:22 so all shells are remotely maneuvered
general 2020-05-25 05:37:28 through my weak spots
general 2020-05-25 05:37:46 in a way that detonates every shell, and fuel tank in my tank
general 2020-05-25 05:38:40 not really
general 2020-05-25 05:38:45 for an april fools event
general 2020-05-25 05:38:49 that would be cool
general 2020-05-25 05:39:12 i already have troubles with T34
general 2020-05-25 05:39:38 T-34 is annoying
general 2020-05-25 05:40:05 if it is showing its pretty side armor
general 2020-05-25 05:40:09 then easy kill
general 2020-05-25 05:40:31 but other then that i find it overperfoming
general 2020-05-25 05:41:04 wdym
general 2020-05-25 05:41:37 wdym
general 2020-05-25 05:41:46 T-34 in war thunder is a solid tank
general 2020-05-25 05:42:09 takes shells like an absolute mad lad
general 2020-05-25 05:42:34 also Cyg remember
general 2020-05-25 05:42:38 Russian bias
general 2020-05-25 05:43:02 what if we got a boycott going for Gaijin to address issues with the game
general 2020-05-25 05:43:03 such
general 2020-05-25 05:43:04 as
general 2020-05-25 05:43:19 listening to the community to start
general 2020-05-25 05:43:52 also here is a test
general 2020-05-25 05:44:06 name one gaijin employee that has played a realistic battle
general 2020-05-25 05:44:12 one
general 2020-05-25 05:44:14 at least one
general 2020-05-25 05:44:33 which one?
general 2020-05-25 05:45:03 wait
general 2020-05-25 05:45:12 SO YOU ARE THE ONE THAT MADE WAR THUNDER BAD
general 2020-05-25 05:45:41 you mean Putin?
general 2020-05-25 05:45:59 wait which Vladimir?
general 2020-05-25 05:46:35 that is basically half of russia
general 2020-05-25 05:47:49 well that is good
general 2020-05-25 05:48:17 Kv-2 need nerf
general 2020-05-25 05:48:48 no that is kinda mean
general 2020-05-25 05:49:18 also how do you destroy gun barrels
general 2020-05-25 05:49:27 i have only managed to do it after i die
general 2020-05-25 05:49:39 or that one time i jumped a StuG
general 2020-05-25 05:49:59 and practically killed him by giving him a heart attack
general 2020-05-25 05:50:11 i could have hit the entire tank
general 2020-05-25 05:50:16 out of the entire StuG
general 2020-05-25 05:50:21 i hit the barrel
general 2020-05-25 05:50:35 and that was the one of two times i have destroyed a barrel
general 2020-05-25 05:50:42 and the one time it actually saved me
general 2020-05-25 05:51:20 he is in for a bad day
general 2020-05-25 05:51:37 tbh i have never played in a Stuart
general 2020-05-25 05:51:42 or not that i can recall
general 2020-05-25 05:52:17 i only see it being hull breaked like every other american tank
general 2020-05-25 05:52:32 by like 20mm guns
general 2020-05-25 05:52:53 specifically of the german variant
general 2020-05-25 05:53:00 German AA is over powered
general 2020-05-25 05:53:13 Italian R3 T20 AA is over powered
general 2020-05-25 05:53:17 soviet AA is noice

general 2020-05-25 17:09:33 <@!493343880478195733> that is noob move
general 2020-05-25 17:11:00 vipEmpire plays World of Tanks
general 2020-05-25 17:11:04 he is always flexing
general 2020-05-25 17:11:14 even though no one else plays WoT
general 2020-05-25 17:11:41 WoWS is nice but i hate the RNG
general 2020-05-25 17:12:03 War Thunder is poking a little bit with naval
general 2020-05-25 17:12:13 they are adding a whole new lineup of ships to Italy
general 2020-05-25 17:12:14 but like
general 2020-05-25 17:12:22 Naval still kinda sucks
general 2020-05-25 17:12:25 its fun sometimes

general 2020-05-25 17:13:20 it might come
general 2020-05-25 17:13:28 but it is unlikely anytime soon
general 2020-05-25 17:14:30 A solid slug does more damage then a bomb in WoWS
general 2020-05-25 17:14:33 i dont get it
general 2020-05-25 17:14:44 AP shells do tons more damage then HE shells
general 2020-05-25 17:16:17 i have never played WoT

general 2020-05-25 17:17:02 which i dont like
general 2020-05-25 17:17:16 i would rather die a slow, painful death
general 2020-05-25 17:17:57 no breach or barrel, no transmission or engine
general 2020-05-25 17:18:00 no way to fight back
general 2020-05-25 17:18:05 that is best way to die

general 2020-05-26 05:37:17 no armor is best armor
general 2020-05-26 05:38:15 i hear so many bad things about german top tier
general 2020-05-26 05:38:25 in both aircraft and in tank
general 2020-05-26 05:38:44 i have one premium
general 2020-05-26 05:39:10 and that is the Galer's F3F
general 2020-05-26 05:39:14 no idea how i got it
general 2020-05-26 05:39:19 but i kinda like it
general 2020-05-26 05:39:57 do you ever just russian bias
general 2020-05-26 05:40:27 imagine playing low graphics just so you can spot through bushes
general 2020-05-26 05:40:47 smh those kind of people are really annoying

general 2020-05-26 05:43:41 i want to know why an AA vehicle at BR 6.0 costs twice its proceeding vehicle when the only different is the ammo is stored outside the AA vehicle
general 2020-05-26 05:43:56 smh american AA and gaijin are bad mix
general 2020-05-26 05:44:52 6.6 dollars for 1k golden eagles
general 2020-05-26 05:45:35 <@!134350023264698368> and then you get jumped by a light tank
general 2020-05-26 05:45:49 always fun
general 2020-05-26 05:46:06 or you get jumped by a Jagdpanter
general 2020-05-26 05:46:19 that cannot be penned through the front
general 2020-05-26 05:46:54 i shoot at the front of a tiger H
general 2020-05-26 05:47:01 and the only thing i ever seem to hit
general 2020-05-26 05:47:08 is either the drivers port
general 2020-05-26 05:47:14 or the machine gun port
general 2020-05-26 05:48:18 no
general 2020-05-26 05:48:34 do you ever just kill a tank with smoke rounds
general 2020-05-26 05:48:42 i guess it is possible
general 2020-05-26 05:49:01 i have not seen anyone do it before
general 2020-05-26 05:49:07 nor have done it
general 2020-05-26 05:49:36 but theoretically you can kill a tank with smoke rounds
general 2020-05-26 05:49:54 well i mean a closed one
general 2020-05-26 05:50:05 like a solid hunk of metal

general 2020-05-26 05:53:45 High Explosive Squash Head
general 2020-05-26 05:54:37 i killed a wirbelwind by clipping the top of it with 37mm round
general 2020-05-26 05:54:57 i have killed many
general 2020-05-26 05:55:09 wirbelwinds are so annoying
general 2020-05-26 05:55:18 honestly though
general 2020-05-26 05:55:41 wirbeldy in both ground, air, and naval
general 2020-05-26 05:55:44 is cancerous
general 2020-05-26 05:55:50 it melts aircraft

general 2020-05-26 05:56:03 and if you have no armor
general 2020-05-26 05:56:10 f in the chat for you

general 2020-05-26 15:20:08 Thee new hydrofoil is going to cause trouble since naval forces dont really use a BR system much like tanks or aircraft
general 2020-05-26 15:20:25 it is more of armament and displacement
general 2020-05-26 15:20:31 seperated by tiers
general 2020-05-26 15:24:14 interesting
general 2020-05-26 15:26:36 well first of all
general 2020-05-26 15:26:42 very few play naval forces
general 2020-05-26 15:27:01 so adding battleships to all nations that have them would be a waste if no one plays
general 2020-05-26 15:27:12 naval forces are quite bugged to be honest
general 2020-05-26 15:27:27 and the tech trees of all nations need to be completely redone
general 2020-05-26 15:27:33 for naval
general 2020-05-26 15:28:59 eee
general 2020-05-26 15:30:51 i once had to wait 3 days for a WoWS update that was 5 GB
general 2020-05-26 15:33:39 the problem is everyone is at home playing fortnite or CSGO or anything else
general 2020-05-26 15:33:45 that uses internet
general 2020-05-26 15:34:07 and our provider never built lines and such expecting anyone to even use them
general 2020-05-26 15:34:22 so when one person does you loose half your internet
general 2020-05-26 15:35:57 i struggled to watch the video announcement my internet was bad before this
general 2020-05-26 15:36:56 okay now it is seems to be catching up
general 2020-05-26 15:37:14 im at an average of 1.6 mb per second
general 2020-05-26 15:37:21 not 0 mb per second
general 2020-05-26 15:37:40 oh now it is pushing 2 mb
general 2020-05-26 15:39:52 imma just play simcity
general 2020-05-26 15:39:59 i have nothing better to do
general 2020-05-26 15:40:30 and i dont want to use the internet while war fun'nt is updating

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 19:09:00 and then i cannot even unfold the superstructure properly because then the rigging gets in the way
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 19:11:00 <@!587459840255983616> you know these are basically duplicates
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 19:11:33 plus you are not following the suggestion format so they are not even going to be recognized

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:29:08 the countless reports
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:29:11 piles of evidence
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:29:28 and even a list i made and voxel pinned so rick could fix those blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:29:42 and almost none of them were fixed
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:29:54 so my boat will be unfinished until then
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:30:10 and it does not help motors become unstable with lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 22:31:31 isnt that the entire world

general 2020-05-27 05:09:50 and the not american hanger exploration allowed ships
general 2020-05-27 05:10:02 so then i could just bombard you
general 2020-05-27 05:10:12 <@!287779983445721088> would you rather
general 2020-05-27 05:10:14 be bombed constantly
general 2020-05-27 05:10:37 or be pummeled constantly
general 2020-05-27 05:10:43 bombs can be aimed
general 2020-05-27 05:10:48 shells cannot
general 2020-05-27 05:11:01 however the ships shells are big boom
general 2020-05-27 05:11:10 and will very well penetrate you
general 2020-05-27 05:11:34 so constant bombing or arty
general 2020-05-27 05:12:34 or banzia
general 2020-05-27 05:14:26 do you ever just rocket a gladiator
general 2020-05-27 05:16:01 yes
general 2020-05-27 05:16:11 oh and by the way
general 2020-05-27 05:16:21 i have never been that accurate with rockets before
general 2020-05-27 05:16:38 <@!287779983445721088> you are now my official target board
general 2020-05-27 05:16:46 better get more armor
general 2020-05-27 05:17:01 also i watched like 5 individual planes dive you
general 2020-05-27 05:17:03 at one time
general 2020-05-27 05:17:16 and i was just watching you suffer
general 2020-05-27 05:17:30 i think i was the only with bombs or rockets
general 2020-05-27 05:17:57 my engine absorbed basically everything you threw at me
general 2020-05-27 05:18:09 no
general 2020-05-27 05:18:11 its an engine
general 2020-05-27 05:18:19 its just quite chunky
general 2020-05-27 05:18:56 the only tank that has shot me down with its main gun
general 2020-05-27 05:19:04 is a leopard a1a1
general 2020-05-27 05:19:13 but it always takes both wings
general 2020-05-27 05:19:16 and nothing else
general 2020-05-27 05:19:34 no
general 2020-05-27 05:19:48 also boats hurt
general 2020-05-27 05:20:17 but it makes my roll rate close to that of a washing machine
general 2020-05-27 05:21:45 i flew a plane and landed with one wing and a damaged engine
general 2020-05-27 05:21:56 the person that had the pic was banned though
general 2020-05-27 05:22:21 instead you can see just how brilliant i am
general 2020-05-27 05:22:56 no
general 2020-05-27 05:23:01 i dont even have wings
general 2020-05-27 05:23:08 it would be cool if i did though
general 2020-05-27 05:23:17 i could just fly to subway
general 2020-05-27 05:24:27 get me a foot long sub on whole grain wheat with tuna, pepperoni, pepper jack cheese, not toasted, with spinach, lettuce, banana peppers, and black olives, no spices, a bag of doritos and a medium sprite
general 2020-05-27 05:24:47 maybe add mayonnaise if im bored
general 2020-05-27 05:27:02 there was a paramotor earlier this year
general 2020-05-27 05:27:13 flying low over the highway
general 2020-05-27 05:27:22 flexing on us ground noobs
general 2020-05-27 05:27:39 even though traffic is never bad on the highway
general 2020-05-27 05:28:21 can is drive underwater?
general 2020-05-27 05:29:03 also can it fall 50 feet into water
general 2020-05-27 05:29:20 shame
general 2020-05-27 05:29:43 you forget to celebrate your dogs birthday
general 2020-05-27 05:29:44 shame
general 2020-05-27 05:29:51 i lost a cat
general 2020-05-27 05:29:53 a dog
general 2020-05-27 05:29:55 another cat
general 2020-05-27 05:29:59 a couple more dogs
general 2020-05-27 05:30:09 and a salamander
general 2020-05-27 05:30:40 why europle?
general 2020-05-27 05:31:39 the paradian ripoff would likely be called the MHGC-13-1 or something
general 2020-05-27 05:31:46 and then nobody would give it a name
general 2020-05-27 05:32:01 unless it did something weird
general 2020-05-27 05:32:03 or cool
general 2020-05-27 05:32:26 something along the lines of harassing your neighbor
general 2020-05-27 05:32:29 kind of cool
general 2020-05-27 05:34:37 also design ID usually go by this: acronym of what is - variant of this type of tank - model
general 2020-05-27 05:35:17 so like lets say you have a strike fighter
general 2020-05-27 05:35:27 and it is heavy
general 2020-05-27 05:35:36 heavy strike fighter: HSF
general 2020-05-27 05:35:45 maybe it is the second heavy strike fighter
general 2020-05-27 05:35:49 HSF-2
general 2020-05-27 05:36:10 and this plane is the 4th of this model
general 2020-05-27 05:36:14 HSF-2-4
general 2020-05-27 05:36:20 give it a cool name
general 2020-05-27 05:36:22 like bob
general 2020-05-27 05:36:29 cux bob is cool name
general 2020-05-27 05:36:42 bob is best name 😤
general 2020-05-27 05:38:03 planes and tanks never get official nicknames for the paradians
general 2020-05-27 05:38:10 only what people call them commonly

general 2020-05-27 20:36:52 casemate guns are not long range
general 2020-05-27 20:37:12 the main guns are
general 2020-05-27 20:37:19 but assuming you can hit a destroyer
general 2020-05-27 20:37:29 they could hit your bridge
general 2020-05-27 20:37:31 fire control
general 2020-05-27 20:37:33 and what not
general 2020-05-27 20:37:48 then aim for the guns

general 2020-05-27 20:39:29 that also pose a large threat
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:40:24 <@!565999170033287320> yes but we are also getting a nether overhaul
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:40:27 which we asked for

general 2020-05-27 20:41:04 torpedoes
general 2020-05-27 20:41:07 are long range
general 2020-05-27 20:41:14 and are better at exploding
general 2020-05-27 20:41:20 jets
general 2020-05-27 20:41:28 can pummel the deck with missiles are bombs
general 2020-05-27 20:41:33 destroying your guns

general 2020-05-27 20:54:59 <@!435946988559925248> eventually

general 2020-05-27 20:55:29 if i lived with my dad
general 2020-05-27 20:55:40 but i would rather be with my mom

general 2020-05-27 20:57:00 not classified
general 2020-05-27 20:57:15 unless he took a certain job then it would probably be classified
general 2020-05-27 20:57:39 he could very well have the third highest paying military job if choose to
general 2020-05-27 20:57:50 triple digit pay
general 2020-05-27 20:58:19 but he likes his job as a drill sergeant and an IT specialist at the Florence ADX

general 2020-05-27 21:04:10 Also if you want to include fictional battleships
general 2020-05-27 21:06:06 I have the Linvia, Aspenae, Argonia, Zellen, Inquiden, Umoni, and the Jimona
general 2020-05-27 21:06:14 all named after dragons of folklore
general 2020-05-27 21:06:21 except for the first two
general 2020-05-27 21:06:27 those who named after real people
general 2020-05-27 21:06:40 and the first one got a kingdom
general 2020-05-27 21:06:58 and then eventually a province that will not stop burning
general 2020-05-27 21:07:32 either from wildfires
general 2020-05-27 21:07:45 or aggressive bombing during war time
general 2020-05-27 21:08:14 all of which have 18.8 inch guns
general 2020-05-27 21:08:19 the Linvia has 12
general 2020-05-27 21:08:30 Aspenae has 9
general 2020-05-27 21:08:36 the rest have 8
general 2020-05-27 21:08:47 but the last 5 are designed for modern warfare
general 2020-05-27 21:09:13 thus look really cool until you are the target
general 2020-05-27 21:09:46 if you are the target then you would have never saw the ships
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 21:10:28 what about Pap?

general 2020-05-28 03:18:31 <@!287779983445721088> my only question is why are you buying higher tier tanks
general 2020-05-28 03:18:35 when you are low level
general 2020-05-28 03:18:58 i had to spell level 3 times before i got it right there
general 2020-05-28 03:20:57 im level 18.7 and i still struggle with gameplay in general
general 2020-05-28 03:21:13 jumping to that higher tier should be painful
general 2020-05-28 03:24:25 the only time jumping tier would be okay
general 2020-05-28 03:24:30 is skipping naval tier II
general 2020-05-28 03:25:09 naval tier II is so
general 2020-05-28 03:25:16 stupid
general 2020-05-28 03:25:40 i mean you can just research the first 2 ships and buy them
general 2020-05-28 03:25:48 then research the last one to get destroyers
general 2020-05-28 03:25:54 then after that you are fine
general 2020-05-28 03:26:46 usually the top tier II vehicle costs more then the top vehicle over all
general 2020-05-28 03:27:39 in germany there is a 20,000 SL repair cost difference
general 2020-05-28 03:27:59 with the Koln compared to the Graf Spee
general 2020-05-28 03:28:03 a frigate
general 2020-05-28 03:28:13 is many times more expensive then a battlecruiser
general 2020-05-28 03:28:47 and gaijin wonders why no one plays naval
general 2020-05-28 03:29:02 because no one wants to grind through tier II
general 2020-05-28 03:29:15 and it is the same for every single nation
general 2020-05-28 03:29:28 including the Italians which were added 2 days ago
general 2020-05-28 04:15:21 smh the ai has created a kongo line and did not invite me
general 2020-05-28 04:17:47 also the guns on the B-17 are quite effective
general 2020-05-28 04:18:02 they are really handy if you decide to turn on your friends
general 2020-05-28 04:19:28 no it is considered a job
general 2020-05-28 04:26:11 ooooh
general 2020-05-28 04:26:14 i like bathrobes
general 2020-05-28 04:30:55 perfect parking

general 2020-05-28 04:43:58 <@!287779983445721088>
general 2020-05-28 05:28:55 do you ever just unlock a new ammo
general 2020-05-28 05:29:04 that is useless compared to the ones you have already unlocked
general 2020-05-28 05:29:13 and you go into battle not realizing you unlocked it
general 2020-05-28 05:29:21 so now you have a full ammo rack
general 2020-05-28 05:30:53 no
general 2020-05-28 05:31:00 i love it when they do it
general 2020-05-28 05:31:24 because then i can just respawn most the time
general 2020-05-28 05:31:47 also i like the creativity
general 2020-05-28 05:31:56 sometimes i will do the same thing
general 2020-05-28 05:32:07 only i take the corpse and push all around
general 2020-05-28 05:32:31 above is bully
general 2020-05-28 05:33:42 yeah churchill is easy to kill
general 2020-05-28 05:33:55 also im watching a video about the Kv-1
general 2020-05-28 05:34:46 or just flank and spank
general 2020-05-28 05:34:54 if you have the speed
general 2020-05-28 05:34:57 and the sneak
general 2020-05-28 05:35:22 usually i wear a bathrobe
general 2020-05-28 05:35:27 but mine is stank
general 2020-05-28 05:35:33 so i have no bathrobe
general 2020-05-28 05:35:35 :(

general 2020-05-28 15:36:16 Cessna makes best dive bombers
general 2020-05-28 15:36:37 That is an opinion and not a fact
general 2020-05-28 15:36:46 However it will be noted for future reference
general 2020-05-28 15:37:12 Aviation is also trash

the-dump 2020-05-28 15:55:25 yes
general 2020-05-28 15:58:22 yes but glass in plane crazy is not breakable
general 2020-05-28 15:58:26 unless kaboom
general 2020-05-28 15:58:28 or pew pew
general 2020-05-28 15:58:31 with pvp on
general 2020-05-28 16:05:52 random WT update
general 2020-05-28 16:09:20 yes lets raid a high school
general 2020-05-28 16:09:25 and demand higher wages
general 2020-05-28 16:10:07 <@!654239873489960970> yes yes and yes
general 2020-05-28 16:10:16 i dont hate adopt me
general 2020-05-28 16:11:06 i dont hate adopt me because it is a high quality game
general 2020-05-28 16:11:14 with tons amount of work put into it
general 2020-05-28 16:11:21 and the devs are honest people
general 2020-05-28 16:11:59 <@!654239873489960970> if plane crazy had the most players online then we would be legally required to blame plane crazy for roblox breaking
general 2020-05-28 16:12:13 yes
general 2020-05-28 16:12:39 roblox is run by monkeys
general 2020-05-28 16:14:01 yeah roblox is not good at roblox
general 2020-05-28 16:14:09 roblox needs to buy a new roblox
general 2020-05-28 16:14:29 also there is a past issue
general 2020-05-28 16:14:40 where some players would hack games and bot them
general 2020-05-28 16:14:58 so somebody may be hacking adopt me
general 2020-05-28 16:15:17 but adopt me is so big no one can take it down without being publicly executed
general 2020-05-28 16:15:28 by higher roblox staff
general 2020-05-28 16:15:37 so if was being hacked
general 2020-05-28 16:15:44 nothing would happen
general 2020-05-28 16:16:00 unless the devs found out then they would likely temporarily take the game down
general 2020-05-28 16:17:34 or monkey got roblox
general 2020-05-28 16:18:19 roblox servers need to be overhauled
general 2020-05-28 16:18:33 make them much more powerful
general 2020-05-28 16:18:44 and more capacity
general 2020-05-28 16:19:03 that is common
general 2020-05-28 16:19:24 plane crazy has been crashing a lot of devices

general 2020-05-29 03:26:36 i rarely play on arcade
general 2020-05-29 03:26:49 also im finding arcade is not for noobs
general 2020-05-29 03:27:15 unless you are just starting out
general 2020-05-29 03:27:22 then it is for torture
general 2020-05-29 03:28:21 also the P-38 never reaches mach 1 in arcade
general 2020-05-29 03:28:24 or realistic
general 2020-05-29 03:29:10 also <@!452273029595267082> how did you even figure out it was arcade?
general 2020-05-29 03:31:14 that half block could be interfering
general 2020-05-29 03:31:32 or wing panel
general 2020-05-29 03:31:41 what ever you have connecting the turret
general 2020-05-29 03:32:00 well it is probably interfering
general 2020-05-29 03:33:12 <@!392778761701031947> Rise of Nations
general 2020-05-29 03:34:06 i dont even know how you connected it in the first place
general 2020-05-29 03:34:30 but you could just replace it with a disconnector upside down
general 2020-05-29 03:34:37 and bind it to a key you do not use
general 2020-05-29 03:34:54 or flip the motor and the block around
general 2020-05-29 03:34:59 so the motor is on top
general 2020-05-29 03:35:29 no
general 2020-05-29 03:35:37 well kind of
general 2020-05-29 03:36:16 a motor has no block limit
general 2020-05-29 03:36:24 but it does have a limit for power
general 2020-05-29 03:36:30 and thus can move less
general 2020-05-29 03:36:48 but that could be turned with even a 1 torque motor
general 2020-05-29 03:37:15 me neither

general 2020-05-29 05:24:51 however i was still exceeding mach speeds
general 2020-05-29 05:34:49 that tail will not last long
general 2020-05-29 05:35:05 still
general 2020-05-29 05:35:11 the heat from the exhaust
general 2020-05-29 05:35:20 will destroy the tail overtime
the-dump 2020-05-29 14:34:40 i will not get expert ranks because the game is too glitchy for me to actually complete my project
the-dump 2020-05-29 14:35:15 and i do not have any time to start another large project before having to leave to colorado
general 2020-05-29 14:35:53 they also gave a years notice
general 2020-05-29 14:36:59 a year ago they announced they were going to remove outlines
general 2020-05-29 14:37:01 and said why
general 2020-05-29 14:40:01 also i really do not understand the struggle of building without outlines
general 2020-05-29 14:46:57 interesting
general 2020-05-29 14:50:27 I guess florida wants to go metric
general 2020-05-29 15:44:15 somebody decided to call our entire team idiots
general 2020-05-29 15:44:26 when he stayed at the airfield the entire match
general 2020-05-29 15:44:32 and has not a single score
general 2020-05-29 15:45:39 but most my team were idiots since they did not climb
general 2020-05-29 15:48:34 I just noticed the P-51 costs more to repair then the Phantom
general 2020-05-29 15:49:02 and the Starfighter is cheaper then most Tier III aircraft
general 2020-05-29 15:50:03 Gaijin bases the repair costs on overall performance of the aircraft
general 2020-05-29 15:50:24 which means the Starfighter is a horrible aircraft
general 2020-05-29 15:50:36 even though it had an entire update dedicated to it
general 2020-05-29 15:51:13 All the most successful companies are the worst companies
general 2020-05-29 15:51:25 in the video game industry
general 2020-05-29 15:51:28 the better you are
general 2020-05-29 15:51:32 the worse you are
general 2020-05-29 15:52:35 i wanna know how the top tier jets are the cheapest jets
general 2020-05-29 15:53:02 for the United States
general 2020-05-29 15:53:40 and then Russia has like the cheapest jets
general 2020-05-29 15:54:05 Russian bias is not a joke tbh
general 2020-05-29 15:54:17 Gaijin is really biased
general 2020-05-29 15:55:39 oh and it gets worse in nations that are not usually played
general 2020-05-29 15:56:10 it gets as cheap as american rank I aircraft
general 2020-05-29 15:56:31 Jesus christ Gaijin
general 2020-05-29 15:56:46 how do you still keep people playing war thunder
general 2020-05-29 16:01:39 Imagine the youtubers boycotting war thunder to convince them to at least balance repair costs
general 2020-05-29 16:01:51 or even to convince them to listen to the community
general 2020-05-29 16:02:11 i could see Spit_flyer doing that without hesitation
general 2020-05-29 16:02:47 Phly and Dita is likely
general 2020-05-29 16:03:01 Bo im not sure
general 2020-05-29 16:03:10 he just plays for fun
general 2020-05-29 16:04:01 never engages in the politics of war thunder
general 2020-05-29 16:06:37 Spit tries not to rant
general 2020-05-29 16:06:45 but war thunder has been getting so bad lately

general 2020-05-29 17:39:59 first there were many protests due to the coronavirus restrictions
general 2020-05-29 17:40:25 but now a police killed an african american and did not get punished
general 2020-05-29 17:40:36 and now people are storming the police stations
general 2020-05-29 17:40:44 breaking into stores and setting them on fire
general 2020-05-29 17:40:54 they even set the police stations on fire
general 2020-05-29 17:40:59 or just one

general 2020-05-29 17:41:57 the cop needs to be punished
general 2020-05-29 17:42:05 but the people overeacted
general 2020-05-29 17:42:12 how badly?

plane-crazy 2020-05-29 22:07:13 except in very special designs
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 22:07:29 that will probably take a quarter of a frame off

general 2020-05-30 05:59:12 plus the stream uptime was only about 50 minutes
general 2020-05-30 05:59:44 im just going to assume its every 30 minutes based on stream uptime
general 2020-05-30 06:00:14 yes you are bully

general 2020-06-01 04:46:49 the judge

general 2020-06-01 04:53:00 and then he started making my mom look like a terrorist or something
general 2020-06-01 04:53:20 and started fighting as hard as possible for custody over us

general 2020-06-01 05:14:18 wtf
general 2020-06-01 05:15:56 i asked this, without asking or stating he copied
general 2020-06-01 05:16:01 i want to see if he will delete it
general 2020-06-01 05:16:12 or say something weird

general 2020-06-01 15:29:31 wasps can die a slow death
general 2020-06-01 15:29:41 they are not at all beneficial
general 2020-06-01 15:29:45 they kill bees
general 2020-06-01 15:29:48 destroy their nests
general 2020-06-01 15:29:55 destroy buildings

general 2020-06-01 16:06:11 The P-38 he credited the build for himself in the vid description
general 2020-06-01 16:06:15 why would you do that?
general 2020-06-01 16:06:45 its kinda suspicious
general 2020-06-01 16:06:56 yeah it makes it seem like he stole a build
general 2020-06-01 22:19:56 well that is good
general 2020-06-01 22:20:07 hopefully it is a better laptop then the original one
general 2020-06-01 22:24:26 <@!287779983445721088>

general 2020-06-01 22:28:42 but could not get a chance to get me because of my teammates
general 2020-06-01 22:28:50 but i was the only one that knew it was there
general 2020-06-01 22:28:55 so i took ma 37 mm gun
general 2020-06-01 22:28:59 loaded HE

general 2020-06-01 22:58:43 the alignment of this building is so OCD triggering
general 2020-06-01 22:59:06 im keeping it because i hate myself
general 2020-06-01 22:59:37 also i tend to kill a lot of people anytime i move entire buildings
general 2020-06-01 22:59:51 but i would also have to move the entire block
general 2020-06-01 23:03:25 you know what never mind
general 2020-06-01 23:03:34 i will just move an entire city blovk
general 2020-06-01 23:04:26 now OCD trigger'nt
general 2020-06-01 23:07:46 bruh i trapped the billager in a chicken cages
general 2020-06-02 16:51:50 my village is anti obc for some reason
general 2020-06-02 17:19:19 https://gyazo.com/d6f793c7e6b1e5dce5477c7336bc9438
general 2020-06-02 17:24:18 it looks really good for a first time ship
general 2020-06-02 17:45:00 imagine modding
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 17:57:55 <@!409676438682206218> i have multiple pics of that issue you stated in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 17:58:15 i was collecting evidence of the issue so i could also make that same suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 17:59:51 do you want to use the pics i have
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:00:02 because why not
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:15:04 i wonder how much fuel my Harmington would have if i built its fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:15:50 it means your ship has a tendency to capsize
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:15:55 it likes to fall over
general 2020-06-02 18:21:43 it likely wont get in because those that do vote have high standards
general 2020-06-02 18:21:46 and there is bias
general 2020-06-02 18:26:09 my ship does have a good chance to get in HoF
general 2020-06-02 18:26:24 but i cannot complete it

the-dump 2020-06-04 14:47:31 and road laws are for communists
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:48:15 what car company is making it so you need to do a breath test for alcohol to start your car

the-dump 2020-06-04 14:50:30 and cross it
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:50:39 even when they can go under it

the-dump 2020-06-04 14:55:26 because then the runway is just a jumbo sized slip'n'slide
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:55:59 the only thing good out of it is then you can drift a plane
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:56:13 break the brakes

general 2020-06-06 04:51:50 i dont even participate in contests
general 2020-06-06 05:16:48 all the moderators are a scam
general 2020-06-06 05:17:06 they request so much maintenance

general 2020-06-06 05:58:21 also maybe learn to drive a car
general 2020-06-06 05:58:36 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-06-06 05:58:45 honestly i would not be surprised though
general 2020-06-06 05:58:53 if we actually did die in 6 months
general 2020-06-06 06:01:20 remember that 2012 movie
general 2020-06-06 06:01:29 made in 2012
general 2020-06-06 06:01:33 you know
general 2020-06-06 06:01:39 earfquacks
general 2020-06-06 06:01:42 big boom boom
general 2020-06-06 06:01:45 lots of water
general 2020-06-06 06:01:58 i dunno about nuclear bombs
general 2020-06-06 06:02:03 no one really wants to go to war
general 2020-06-06 06:02:12 except russia and the united states
general 2020-06-06 06:02:16 in the form of a space race
general 2020-06-06 06:02:39 Elon Musk launched people into space
general 2020-06-06 06:02:44 and bragged about it
general 2020-06-06 06:02:51 and so did the government sort of
general 2020-06-06 06:03:07 and russia wants to do space race again
general 2020-06-06 06:03:22 China is dealing with their own problems
general 2020-06-06 06:03:51 well that is all they are doing
general 2020-06-06 06:03:56 and nothing else
general 2020-06-06 06:04:34 right now the only people wanting to go to war with china are youtube advertisements against Biden
general 2020-06-06 06:05:10 wdym riots
general 2020-06-06 06:05:14 yeah
general 2020-06-06 06:05:53 i prefer not to think about that
general 2020-06-06 06:05:56 cause if i do
general 2020-06-06 06:06:02 i might have a panic attack
general 2020-06-06 06:06:22 since i have to go straight through those protests
general 2020-06-06 06:06:27 at least three times
general 2020-06-06 06:06:29 in one day
general 2020-06-06 06:06:33 tomorrow
general 2020-06-06 06:07:16 yeah that was like January February stuff for me
general 2020-06-06 06:07:33 actually economic failure i saw coming once i understood the basics
general 2020-06-06 06:07:51 well yes
general 2020-06-06 06:08:06 we were doing that before the coronavirus
general 2020-06-06 06:08:16 like getting sick but without showing the symptoms
general 2020-06-06 06:08:26 you appear and feel healthy
general 2020-06-06 06:08:32 just like the economy
general 2020-06-06 06:08:44 yeah i know
general 2020-06-06 06:09:41 the world sucks right now
general 2020-06-06 06:09:57 and so does orange juice for some reason
general 2020-06-06 06:10:47 The US is so powerful if it does collapse it might take the world with it
general 2020-06-06 06:11:36 i know
general 2020-06-06 06:11:43 you said that like 3 times already
general 2020-06-06 06:13:09 the ~~United~~ States of America is suffering from civil unrest, economic failure, creepy old people, and a stronk version of the flue
general 2020-06-06 06:14:40 i wonder how our enemies would react to our collapse
general 2020-06-06 06:15:04 it would be hard to invade us because well our military would still be there
general 2020-06-06 06:15:07 kind of
general 2020-06-06 06:15:15 the geography
general 2020-06-06 06:15:25 and the shear population of Karens
general 2020-06-06 06:15:30 would make it very difficult
general 2020-06-06 06:16:32 if the united states collapsed i assume the states would become their own countires
general 2020-06-06 06:16:35 at least texas
general 2020-06-06 06:16:38 or california
general 2020-06-06 06:17:40 who would take Wisconsin though
general 2020-06-06 06:18:07 China can no
general 2020-06-06 06:18:15 Russia meh
general 2020-06-06 06:18:57 But what about the United States allies?
general 2020-06-06 06:19:05 Texas would fight back
general 2020-06-06 06:19:54 i mean like Canada, Britain, Japan, Germany, France, all those guys
general 2020-06-06 06:20:57 What if germany did world wars all over again but this time without angering russian and with more freedom and democracy
general 2020-06-06 06:21:59 what about
general 2020-06-06 06:22:08 Russia and China going to war
general 2020-06-06 06:22:36 same

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:26:33 To bad I cannot finish my shipu until like September
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:27:41 All the fun stuff I want and needed is being done when It does not matter for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:29:49 I have an almost 8k block ship that is not completed due to glitches, but now I am coming up with new ideas to improve faster then Soviet industry makes tanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:30:45 Sadly
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:31:15 I heard fun stuff was happening
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:32:06 Also what in the world is The Penthouse supposed to be
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:32:37 Like vip gen?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:35:19 I know how to make my ship an actual shipwreck
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:35:33 But I have spent like 3 months on it
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:35:53 And its going to half a year old before I can finish it
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:37:50 Now im sad because I just realized what I could build for the contest
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:38:17 The one contest I would be willing to participate in
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:38:38 And I do not have a computer
general 2020-06-21 13:16:44 > Rickje has trust issues
<@!435946988559925248> No mad has the trust issues after an admin banned tons of
general 2020-06-21 13:16:54 players from a game
general 2020-06-21 13:17:28 Mad is the one saying no though
general 2020-06-21 13:17:52 Unless Rick is just saying that
general 2020-06-21 13:18:54 Im pretty sure that is madattak due to an incident in one of his games
general 2020-06-21 13:19:05 Nearly ruined by an admin
general 2020-06-21 13:19:39 When?
general 2020-06-21 13:20:23 Yeah
general 2020-06-21 13:20:57 I don't think Roblox even knows about Rick's position
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:58:48 Bruh Rick quit updating the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:59:14 Im only 3 weeks in out if the 11
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:00:19 staph make i cri 😥
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:02:44 We do
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:03:35 Also someone from here is copying my name
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:04:26 CoolBoysee who I assumed was banned like everyone in my friends list
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:08:42 Bruh I cannot remember the password to my naval alt
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:19:56 So my kindle can handle my 8k block ship at min graphics without crashing
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:00 Well almost
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:21:25 I would like to test the upper limits but I cannot remember what half the keys binds are for
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:22:16 And the stupod amounts of disconnectors would probably light my kindle on fire
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:24:01 The good thing us the summer event ends a month after I get back to Wisconsin
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:24:13 So I do not have to worry
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:25:23 Plus it is almost 100% likely my school will at least do optional online classes which I plan to take
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:25:32 And it is now raining
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 20:03:39 Why does everything interesting seem to happen when im offline
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:36:52 ehh
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:37:18 Maybe it will be worth it to still build on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:37:48 I have so much time
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:38:05 I might as well
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:51:21 No it is not worth it
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:52:57 The building system is torture
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:55:47 If only I had a PC
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:57:06 There needs to be a system of just place or delete blocks with your finger like on pc, but it would highlight the area  and you would have to confirm that is what you want to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:58:03 But click the same area again to deny placing or deleting that block in case you made a mistake
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:58:22 <@!287459677611098114> I am at my dad for the summer
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:58:56 Thus I do not have my own computer to play
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:59:09 So im stuck with my kindle
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 14:59:37 August 22 is when i go back
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:00:00 I brought two large books but finished one already
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:00:18 I mean I have plenty to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:00:37 But I want to play plane lazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:01:11 I want finish bote :(
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:03:11 I could not finish it because rick refuses to fix his game
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:03:43 Intead he adds a super soaker, stairs, and ladders
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:04:03 Which honestly are not that bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:04:23 But fix bug first
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:04:50 Some of us are allergic
general 2020-06-26 15:05:48 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2020-06-26 15:05:56 Targets
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:39:56 Magnets do magnet stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:40:17 There is nothing special about them
general 2020-06-27 18:07:45 What chaos be happening
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:09:12 I like spices
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:09:24 Gim
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:09:30 Or i take by force
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:03:00 Ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:03:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:03:19 I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:04:05 Imagine plane crazy having lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:04:54 Unanxhored parts lag less because physik
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:05:41 Anchored parts lag less
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:05:47 Brain broke
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:06:13 Get a better computer
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:06:34 Or turn your graphics setting down
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:08:32 Lag should not be an issue until you have an 8k block war ship with 7 folding parts unanchored at min graphics on a Kindle Fire 8 HD
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:10:30 weak
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:11:09 Whenever I spawn my ship no one complains
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:11:25 But then again they all crash or leave
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:12:09 You need to have epic gamer computer to endure vip1 sometimes
general 2020-06-27 21:14:37 Smellywood approves

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:19:58 According to research conducted in War Splinter Ground RB
general 2020-06-27 21:22:23 There might be a plugin somewhere

general 2020-07-19 04:16:45 I am about ready to punch out a glass window
general 2020-07-19 04:17:57 I gave up on trying to fall asleep

general 2020-07-19 04:18:45 Unlike my entire family

general 2020-07-19 04:19:46 Despite the door being open

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:01:53 plus i am already in drawing the plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:02:45 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:05:58 This was the original inspiration behind the plane i am designing now
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:07:05 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:08:33 an h tail would look really weird on a plane like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:09:08 plus it might be too big and heavy overall

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:10:38 kek
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:28 it also has to be small
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:14 those shells though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:46 you know you can use half spheres/balls
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:19:06 for the ballistic cap and not pyramids
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:19:15 which look really bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:19:43 also the golden color is a bit bright
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:08 Why is the swedish cheese wedge so popular all of a sudden?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:41 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:52 sweden was added a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:29 If builds weee being based on war thunder updates then qe would be seeing more Starfighters, Demons, and Italian warships
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:22:29 I used trails for trim and radar sytems on my ship when they first came out
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:23:03 and it was also trails that made it so i could not complete my ship before i left to Colorado for the summer
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:27:49 I just came up with a stupid idea to install a bomb to any small aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:17 a sort of harness that you can strap a bomb to that goes around the wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:24 like a seat belt almost
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:29:19 but you run a wire from the cockpit to the harness and pull on it (or retrofit a release lever or something) to drop the bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:03 Now you can take your measly bush plane and turn it into an a ground attacker
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:08 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:59 it would likely be a lighter bomb

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:39:00 which he flexed to the point of death
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:39:50 Yeah they can
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:40:01 warships can shred
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:40:24 Yes but planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:40:33 and tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:40:51 ships are designed to take large punishment
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:41:00 and they can in planw crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:41:11 the only issue is with folding
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:41:58 Paradian warships
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:42:07 designed to be quick
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:42:13 and very powerful
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:42:19 however they lack armor
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:42:28 even the battleships
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:42:41 ^
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:43:24 Unless you want to make your tank look like it got attacked by a swarm of bees
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:46:08 The issue with warships in Plane Crazy is hydrodynamics and folding
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:46:34 You cannot put much armor on the ship or you become an island
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:47:10 plus a torpedo or bomb to the folding point will snap a ship right i two
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:47:49 Plus plot sizes limit the max size
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:28 You say warships are useless but compared to half of what is built in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:17 yes

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:35:09 Doesn't California have the largest population of a US state?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:35:20 33 million?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:38:46 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:38:49 Wyoming
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:39:09 Followed by North Dakota and then Alaska
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:40:22 Reminds me of the American M3 GMC

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:42:34 Could you just make a barrel or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:42:42 set it out in the open
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:42:48 and pic that as a target
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:43:18 like they did in Planes: Fire and Rescue

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:50:28 German tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:50:29 do not
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:50:37 in any way shape or form
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:50:47 look like Bruhssians
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:51:15 The StuG is a meme
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:51:28 A Tiger
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:51:38 he could not figure that out
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:51:56 does his parents only let him watch Disney movies?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:52:31 The tiger is the most iconic german tonk
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:52:38 Both models
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:52:51 Sherman is american
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:52:58 T-34 bruhsian
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:53:12 Tigor german
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:53:29 Churchill British

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:54:22 you learn this is preschool
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:55:07 Russians have *c u r v e s* and all our wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:55:12 germans are blocc
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:55:43 Early tanks were not very cuevy
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:55:50 Yeah that is BT
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:56:29 The camo might give it away
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:56:51 Also so do the tracks if you look at them
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:58:21 Bruh I thought you had just mentioned a german tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:58:25 but i read it
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:58:32 nope
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:58:57 Give her T95
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 22:59:05 see what she guesses
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:00:32 T-44?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:01:08 3 strikes your out <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:01:30 Okay
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:01:41 give her something that should be obvious
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:02:02 M4 shebruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:02:41 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:02:55 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:05:40 here is a tricky one
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 23:05:55 the M4A1 FL10
general 2020-07-26 23:07:02 building
general 2020-07-26 23:07:31 If I could fly I would fly to help building
general 2020-07-26 23:07:53 but yeah it is dumb to exploit
general 2020-07-26 23:08:14 Clipping can also be useful for building
general 2020-07-26 23:08:24 Teleporting maybe
general 2020-07-26 23:08:33 if like to help someone else
general 2020-07-26 23:08:42 Larger builds
general 2020-07-26 23:08:59 When building large ships or aircraft
general 2020-07-26 23:09:21 clipping to get at interior elements would be very useful
general 2020-07-26 23:09:27 maybe to tweak something
general 2020-07-26 23:10:04 maybe
general 2020-07-26 23:10:48 however if you have like a complex system, or multiple blocks inside that need breaking
general 2020-07-26 23:10:53 it could be troublesome
general 2020-07-26 23:11:08 Such as a time when building my ship
general 2020-07-26 23:11:58 i messed something up and had to completely disassemble the the turrets vertical drive
general 2020-07-26 23:12:01 well usually
general 2020-07-26 23:12:17 but you have people such as Proto and Sakura
general 2020-07-26 23:12:32 who are veterans and basically engineering gods
general 2020-07-26 23:12:46 who also used exploits to do some stuff
general 2020-07-26 23:14:07 the
general 2020-07-27 01:17:44 Like bruh
general 2020-07-27 01:17:55 a week ago I had 5 weeks to go
general 2020-07-27 01:18:03 now I have 4
general 2020-07-27 01:18:12 but it felt like 3 weeks
general 2020-07-27 01:19:35 snojbodjvs I'm going crazy
general 2020-07-27 01:19:36 help
general 2020-07-27 01:20:50 I might actually speak in le VC just to pass time
bot-central 2020-07-27 01:24:43 ?whois
bot-central 2020-07-27 01:25:00 ?ping
bot-central 2020-07-27 01:25:04 lies
bot-central 2020-07-27 01:25:21 That was 10000 ping moment
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:25:59 kinda basic
general 2020-07-27 01:26:25 oh no
general 2020-07-27 01:26:37 what
general 2020-07-27 01:27:10 Im on mobile so not that is matters
general 2020-07-27 01:27:13 but um
general 2020-07-27 01:27:17 sails need wind
general 2020-07-27 01:27:29 there is no wind
general 2020-07-27 01:27:35 in plane crazy
general 2020-07-27 01:28:33 you could maybe vibrate the sails in such a way that physics make the boat move
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:29:20 dense fabric?
general 2020-07-27 01:30:00 k bye
general 2020-07-27 01:31:04 <@!660341617537843210> best bot ~~not~~,
general 2020-07-27 01:32:14 Audit moment
general 2020-07-27 01:32:29 k bye
general 2020-07-27 01:33:31 Nah
general 2020-07-27 01:33:36 Wisconsin is bad
general 2020-07-27 01:33:55 Wisconsin could be tropical if it did not get so cold
general 2020-07-27 01:34:28 Like summers are 90 degrees Fahrenheit and 200% humidity
general 2020-07-27 01:34:40 and then winters get down to -30
general 2020-07-27 01:34:48 not including wind chill
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:39:45 Fabric is the lightest, if not tied with others
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:40:30 Also diamond plate is not the heaviest
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:41:32 That is very common
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:41:36 even here
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:42:05 with all the veters and experts and expert veterans
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:42:39 No I use hexagons
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:10 Imagine pvp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:24 Imagine class
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:43 but like
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:50 it is summer
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:53 world events
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:55 and yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:43:57 study
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:44:02 and pay attention
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:44:19 maybe your teacher is talking about plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:44:31 and how to build a stable air raft
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:44:34 or ship
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:44:36 or tonk
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:45:03 Imagine having class though
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:45:40 Imagine being able to evan have your own computer though <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:45:53 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:46:14 Swedish moldy cheese wedge
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:47:11 2x4 half wedge his tinkle tank would be
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:47:32 more wedges when
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:04:58 Master [X] Ranks are achieved by getting a creation into the <#627195143040139264> ,
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:05:48 No idea why Master ranks are not mentioned
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:07:38 basic hull
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:08:26 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:12:01 How else would ranks be done?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:12:09 Upvotes maybe
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:12:43 but there are more issues with upvotes to get roles
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:13:00 such as average activity of the server at certain times
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:13:17 trolls who downvote everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:13:32 Noobs who downvote the good creations
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:14:18 and also people who just do not care and wull upvite everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:14:28 also wdym quality checks?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:15:33 > quality checks
<@!287779983445721088> wdym
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:18:39 yeah bias
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:18:47 also we need a lot more mods for that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:18:56 and across the globe
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:19:09 because activity
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:19:36 bias is hard to prove
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:19:43 and hard to deal with
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:21:37 Honestly block count is the best way to rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:22:09 Since artificial increase of blocks can be easy to spot on smaller builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:22:16 for lower ranked
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:23:11 higher ranked people like us who understand the concept of motor lock could increase block count for details
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:23:43 Also most people are too lazy to spam blocks inside builds to increase the block count
general 2020-07-27 02:28:09 What was the point of the F-35?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:30:53 🐌
general 2020-07-27 02:32:18 Same

general 2020-07-27 02:33:26 Wait
general 2020-07-27 02:33:36 but that means we have to kill rick
general 2020-07-27 02:34:18 Dry air irritating your lungs?
general 2020-07-27 02:34:27 Could be sore muscle
general 2020-07-27 02:34:30 allergies
general 2020-07-27 02:34:40 or maybe debri
general 2020-07-27 02:35:08 Well its summer here and it is really wet and humid
general 2020-07-27 02:35:17 when it is supposed to be very dry
general 2020-07-27 02:35:50 Yes
general 2020-07-27 02:35:53 I know
general 2020-07-27 02:36:03 I lived in North Dakota
general 2020-07-27 02:36:06 and Kentucky
general 2020-07-27 02:36:11 and Georgia
general 2020-07-27 02:36:17 and Wisconsin
general 2020-07-27 02:36:51 le wet states (ish. North Dakota just has many lakes and ponds, but like no rain)
general 2020-07-27 02:37:39 where?
general 2020-07-27 02:38:32 I also lived in South Korea but like I have no idea what the climate is
general 2020-07-27 02:38:57 And Colorado
general 2020-07-27 02:39:09 I livesd there too
general 2020-07-27 02:40:33 and I guess South Korea if you own scuba gear
general 2020-07-27 02:40:54 just drive across the ocean floor

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:59:06 its not
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:59:56 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:00:06 organization and easy on the eyes
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:04:13 the heck is that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:04:34 Now your just showing bias
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:11:14 10000 days?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:11:49 Plane crazy is not that old
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:11:54 not at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:12:07 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:12:16 Rickje boomer
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:12:49 Why tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:12:55 the graphics?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:13:04 The graphics are not at all bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:13:22 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:11 The new map is Henkku's map
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:16 and we all have seen it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:30 but henkuu was permed
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:34 so no new map
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:15:12 unless rickje lets me work on map <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:15:56 Wedges are hard to implement
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:09 plus the block menu is absolute trash
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:23 and needs to be redone befoee news wedges can be added
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:30 1-2
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:38 but that is still long af
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:42 for one block
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:16:54 Same
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:17:26 But tbh im better at terrain design then modelling
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:17:33 and not at all with coding

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:29:29 Rick there was a trick that was going on that would essentially make a ping not work via zero width space. However the trick backfired and discord accepted some of the pings. Unfortunately the fake pings for rick and madattak
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:30:56 (in case this was nit seen the first time) there was a trick that was going on that would essentially make a ping not work via zero width space. However the trick backfired and discord accepted some of the pings. Unfortunately the fake pings for rick and madattak

plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:39:42 i remember when i was 12
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:39:44 i hated it
general 2020-07-29 18:40:19 if you have too
general 2020-07-29 18:40:24 use even more motors
general 2020-07-29 18:41:46 anti-matter?
general 2020-07-29 18:42:24 Yeah
general 2020-07-29 18:43:13 plus you have the theoretical matter of what name i cannot remember that just repels everything
general 2020-07-29 18:43:24 outlines
general 2020-07-29 18:43:32 outlines look wonk now tbh
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:44:27 i don't miss outlines
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:44:59 togglable before?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:45:17 because outlines were originally togglable for games
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:45:47 like in studio you could choose whether parts had outlines or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:46:18 however that setting was global so either all blocks had outlines or none at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:46:28 unless you made custom outlines
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:52:28 my best guess is like how it springs back
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:52:45 restitution means to return to its original state
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:53:02 but only rick would know exactly
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:53:20 we would have to ask rick that
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 18:54:36 makes sense
general 2020-07-29 18:55:52 yes

general 2020-08-01 01:54:26 bruh im being silently driven crazy
general 2020-08-01 02:04:02 my dad decided to challenged (forced) me into a race up and down the street because i joke asked my brother "does you motor control?" because he was like having a figurative muscle stroke ( not an actual stroke, totally figurative) and said i made a smart alec comment. He said if I lost I would have to walk or run up and down the hill again 4 times. He asked if we had a deal, I said no, he ignored it. It annoyed me, and my dad was making fun of me saying I was getting mad because "I was a smart teenager who knows everything and thinks I rule the world." On top of that he says I have to be ready at 6 in the morning. I cannot wake up that early without an alarm clock, much less even wake up. He then claims he can wake up without an alarm clock. Which is true but he has a sleep schedule and has maintained it for years on end. He said he never used an alarm clock, but i strictly know he used one.
general 2020-08-01 02:04:03 ahhh

general 2020-08-05 01:07:12 how am i still sane
general 2020-08-05 01:13:49 My dad told me to put an extension cord away, to put it in the shed, well he meant the lower shed, built into the house, not the upper one. He also wanted me to put away a small hand held grinder, but he never said too. It made him mad and so I ended up in a passive aggressive lecture, one that really triggers me. He said that when I am told to do something it means do thrice more, if he did not do it when he was my age, it usually involved flying bricks. My step-mom said it was likely the way my brain works that made me only do what I was told, to which my dad responded saying that I did not have aspergers syndrome, the likely cause of my straight forward working mind.
general 2020-08-05 01:15:10 Last time I checked he was saying he had aspergers syndrome just so he could explain why he works the way he does, but also said he could not get diagnosed with it else he would be discharged from the military.
general 2020-08-05 01:16:11 Yet now he syas there is no official diagnosis for aspergers, yet I have an official diagnosis by a licensed psychologist
general 2020-08-05 01:17:26 He also said he would limit my time online through the router, and said not to take it as a punishment. Despite the context screaming punishment.
general 2020-08-05 01:18:26 Yet that also makes it a bigger issue since me and my brother rely on my kindle to talk with our mom, siblings, and friends.
general 2020-08-05 01:20:57 My kindle has been able to keep me calm and sane by doing stuff I actually enjoy, able to vent safely if I get really mad. (What I am doing now.) Else I would likely be another Jameson due to the fact my aspergers makes me more emotionally sensitive.
general 2020-08-05 01:21:47 19 days left until I leave

general 2020-08-06 23:40:14 No rules to break
general 2020-08-06 23:43:01 There could be something such as Jameson and his parents
general 2020-08-06 23:43:10 Mentally troubled
general 2020-08-07 00:03:25 I wonder if that kid has a situation where his parents are at work all the time, and he has no friends at school or anywhere else. So maybe has no one to interact with. A common problem in the United States and many other countries.

general 2020-08-08 01:39:23 below?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 01:42:53 is he like engrash?
general 2020-08-08 03:06:57 According to my dad everyone that was born after the year 2000 are arrogant jerks who care about nothing but their wants even if their life is on the line. They get offended by something as much as a pebble in the street gutters. To put it mildly so I don't get perm banned.
general 2020-08-08 03:07:18 I like cannot even joke anymore without him freaking out and saying that
general 2020-08-08 03:08:15 I mean that is true for like a minor amount of people
general 2020-08-08 03:08:39 he also thinks child abuse laws are stupid and should be removed
general 2020-08-08 03:09:24 Well he would not unless it is legal
general 2020-08-08 03:11:13 he gets mad at my mom when she goes outside to water the plants and here I am being left home alone for 8 hours
general 2020-08-08 03:11:21 In Colorado Springs
general 2020-08-08 03:11:36 population too much with a crime issue
general 2020-08-08 03:12:15 as compared to where i live with my mom where the only crime commited was porch pirating last year
general 2020-08-08 03:13:08 If my step-mom cannot sway him then not even the entire United States military could
general 2020-08-08 03:13:49 Well actually he said anyone of my generation
general 2020-08-08 03:13:59 and anyone white
general 2020-08-08 03:15:06 In Colorado, two dogs, two guinea pigs, and two hamsters
general 2020-08-08 03:15:20 Wisconsin a cat and a dog
general 2020-08-08 03:16:21 No
general 2020-08-08 03:16:52 but he would commit warcrimes just to make sure cats go extinct
general 2020-08-08 03:17:20 for no reason other then they are not very active
general 2020-08-08 03:17:49 And by warcrimes i mean literal warcrimes
general 2020-08-08 03:18:04 not an exaggeration
general 2020-08-08 03:18:43 Oh yes also his idea of cats also applies to all Chinese people
general 2020-08-08 03:18:56 good or bad
general 2020-08-08 03:19:48 Yet he says my mom is extremely bad, his ideas would concern even the angry german mustache man
general 2020-08-08 03:20:10 He says that too
general 2020-08-08 03:20:39 Yeah :/
general 2020-08-08 03:20:43 very fun
general 2020-08-08 03:21:48 He also likes to abuse his credentials being 20 years in the army, 9 years federal employee, and almost has a phd in Information technology
general 2020-08-08 03:22:54 What are those?
general 2020-08-08 03:23:46 Im interested on what is on that pizza?
general 2020-08-08 03:25:45 I am incredibly mentally resilient so its merely just an annoyance to me
general 2020-08-08 03:28:05 Although I do think given enough time I might crack which is not at all good based on the stuff I did and thought when I was younger
general 2020-08-08 03:29:05 The stuff that makes me happy is the stuff he wants to destroy
general 2020-08-08 03:29:20 Also im 14
general 2020-08-08 03:29:29 coming close to 15
general 2020-08-08 03:29:55 She hates him, but for the most part ignores him
general 2020-08-08 03:30:22 More or less
general 2020-08-08 03:31:16 I don't know if we even can
general 2020-08-08 03:32:44 Well for one courts are an easy way to loose your life savings, and my dad would just come up with a metric ship ton of lies that would cause way too many issues.
general 2020-08-08 03:33:40 Private investigators are too expensive
general 2020-08-08 03:34:08 plus he has nothing on him
general 2020-08-08 03:35:22 The most that I can do is somehow record some of his tangens that may raise concern
general 2020-08-08 03:35:32 Yes and no
general 2020-08-08 03:35:40 We cannot fight him
general 2020-08-08 03:35:47 no
general 2020-08-08 03:36:01 No
general 2020-08-08 03:38:54 all his racist stuff and his story about his childhood, his hate for society, his success, and how my mom is a bad parent because we do not have a high maintenance house to take care of or a job that pays more then a quintillion dollars
general 2020-08-08 03:40:06 He has only had a couple of those this year, only when I say something he did not like, or I stayed in my kindle a second too long
general 2020-08-08 03:41:20 I practically was forced into listening all he wants me to do just to avoid what happened a lot last year
general 2020-08-08 03:42:13 And my brother tries to help just to prevent that stuff from happening to me and/or him
general 2020-08-08 03:43:39 At this point the only thing I can do is too just stay quiet, which I already do, but then he makes some comment that just grinds me down
general 2020-08-08 03:43:53 About how quiet i am
general 2020-08-08 03:44:55 I also move slower then most people, due too my aspergers and just my general clumsiness, which bothers him
general 2020-08-08 03:46:49 A type of autism that makes me more emotionally sensitive, but also more creative. It helps me focus on what interests me, but also makes me easily distracted. It is also why I always make custom builds
general 2020-08-08 03:47:05 Although my dad does not realize that
general 2020-08-08 03:47:18 even though last year he said he had it
general 2020-08-08 03:47:24 he knows exactly what it is
general 2020-08-08 03:47:37 yeah
general 2020-08-08 03:48:13 He is the most incredible hypocrite
general 2020-08-08 03:48:51 It is honestly astounding how much he can contradict his own words
general 2020-08-08 03:50:55 He tried to shun my mom because I sleep quite a lot, but she ignored him, so he turned to me and starting throwing tons of different sources from doctors, magezines, and what not about how long I should be sleeping. I get here, and all of sudden I should not be sleeping at all
general 2020-08-08 03:51:35 I also can wake myself up and whatever time I want, which I have literally seen not me or anyone else do
general 2020-08-08 03:52:04 I doubt even he can, since he has retained the same sleep schedule for 9 years
general 2020-08-08 03:52:28 So he justs wake up naturally
general 2020-08-08 03:53:12 My past helps a lot
general 2020-08-08 03:53:22 and my family is otherwise very supportive

general 2020-08-08 15:16:30 but large builds also have more room for more detailing and more functionality

No longer can you use swear words. Instead you have to substitute swear words for PCC staff.
general 2020-08-09 00:06:34 Why is it if you live in the United States you are either from Florida or California?
general 2020-08-09 00:06:52 And then I am here living in Wisbruhsin
general 2020-08-09 00:08:28 > Georgia gang 😎
<@!430739561690431489> My brother was born there
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:09:04 Why is it that jets are so commonly built out of stone or slate
general 2020-08-09 00:09:51 No you still have time
general 2020-08-09 00:09:58 just disregard safety regulations
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:11:34 I just use the original material
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:11:41 so metal parts out of metal
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:11:45 wood out of wood
general 2020-08-09 00:11:56 yes
general 2020-08-09 00:17:39 Luckily most American schools no longer have gym
general 2020-08-09 03:48:20 Lmao I was bored so I decided to play Work at a Pizza Place. So I join, do measly cashier stuff for a while, until I was able to become a manager. I take the manager position and immediately this girl starts begging to get a bonus. I tell her to become a supplier and fill up the stock of cheese, dough, soda and boxes. She does that and so I give her a bonus. Two other girls get mad at me out of jealousy that this other got a bonus and they did not.
general 2020-08-09 03:50:27 They start freaking out and calling me names and such. One leaves and the other continues harassing me. Figuring out she could not win she to go destroy the kitchen, and blame it on the current cook. Well the current cook is my brother.
general 2020-08-09 03:50:51 So I knew she was trying to frame him, because I watched it all.
general 2020-08-09 03:51:17 i like writing
general 2020-08-09 03:51:20 its fun
general 2020-08-09 03:51:42 I would give anyone a stroke if they watched me write
general 2020-08-09 03:52:04 And actually when school starts it will be my first uear in high school
general 2020-08-09 03:54:06 But anyways her sister joined and started to fight me and brother. The one is just there to yell at me while the original continues to tear up the kitchen, not believing the cook was my brother.
general 2020-08-09 03:55:41 Eventually they start swearing, somehow immune to the filter, and continue to harass me. Eventually the new one gives up, and so does the other one, but started spammimg "KICK THE MANAGER"
general 2020-08-09 03:57:00 I left to get ready for bed, but in that time they figured I had left and continued to harass my brother, telling him to apologize for "making them mad." Trademark Karen move right there.
general 2020-08-09 03:57:17 I'm on mobile
general 2020-08-09 03:59:02 I come back to a nightmare of a kitchen and them bullying my brother. At this point I report them, but they have no idea. They see I am alive and start pestering me into apologizing , but this time they give no reason.
general 2020-08-09 04:00:31 They do this for maybe 20 more minutes and this other person joins, and then tells me to stop acting like a baby. Another girl. At this point I have been attacked by like 5 girls.
general 2020-08-09 04:01:35 I get tired of standing around waiting for them just to give up and leave, like anyone would usually do, so I just say sorry, and all returns to normal.
general 2020-08-09 04:01:47 Then roblox crashes <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2020-08-09 16:49:13 > right now i prefer going to school physically over online schools

general 2020-08-11 03:00:25 Yeah
general 2020-08-11 03:00:54 But Russia has a tank designed to withstand a nuclear blast
the-dump 2020-08-11 17:31:48 is boy cow
general 2020-08-11 17:33:08 Adopt Me is like that amusement park inside the Mall of America
general 2020-08-11 17:33:36 Really well built and planned, but meant for the younger kids
general 2020-08-11 17:34:08 tbh it also looks cool
general 2020-08-11 17:34:28 If you have no idea what I am talking about just google it

general 2020-08-11 19:30:47 I need Robux so I can get vip servers to bribe puri into hosting an event for me
general 2020-08-11 19:32:00 Or alternatively I could easily find an almost empty server on any game and just have my profile linked to people can join
general 2020-08-11 19:33:07 > what i never seen exploiters in plane crazy
<@!363742162757877761> There is not much you can get from exploiting
general 2020-08-11 19:33:13 other then building easier
general 2020-08-11 19:34:53 I would recommend Super Bomb Survival, but the servers are not big enough
general 2020-08-11 19:35:51 you just get banned?
general 2020-08-11 19:37:24 They cannot stop all of us!!!

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 19:44:12 For studio you can do that
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 19:44:21 build something from a blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 19:45:02 but for Plane Crazy you would have to take a pic of the build and find a blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 19:45:29 i dunno ask purified how he does it
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 19:45:39 im not sure how exactly

general 2020-08-12 22:00:39 wut
general 2020-08-12 22:01:35 adopt me has so little players online that roblox died
general 2020-08-12 22:02:15 Yet it is high quality
general 2020-08-12 22:03:00 It helps to make a high quality roleplaying game targeted at the largest age group on Roblox
general 2020-08-12 22:03:10 And then add what they all want
general 2020-08-12 22:04:47 Bruh the chat rooms in Discord were shutdown because people where spamming

general 2020-08-12 22:17:07 in announcements of all places
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 22:23:05 > no im really not, i hate myself for defending it
I am not pro adopt me, and im not against adopt me. I don't hate myself for defending the game since it is a high quality game with more put into the game and it's community then arguably Plane Crazy. However they have a well written code so doing work on it is not trying to find the right cord out of a tangled mass of hundreds other cords.
general 2020-08-12 22:23:27 Naval is fun
general 2020-08-12 22:23:37 and quite difficult

general 2020-08-13 02:54:49 > alr kids gotta pack up my things bc eviction notice aaaaaa
<@456226577798135808> My mind went straight to Doctor Helen Kaiser of the QSERF game on roblox who exploited an issue in an experimental dark matter enfused nuclear fusion reactor, ordered a facility lockdown drill, trapping everyone under ground. The reactor was ordered to be online while maintenance was conducted, which triggered a series of events causing the reactor to explode with the force of a nuclear bomb, whilst she was out an d everyone was trapped. All because she did not get her promotion

general 2020-08-13 19:52:22 A shredder bug without a shredder is just a disabled rocket
general 2020-08-13 19:53:38 If a shark is a shredder bug then my 8k block warship is a shredder bug
general 2020-08-13 19:53:43 If used correctly
general 2020-08-13 19:54:30 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/743546269141696652 This is shredder bug
general 2020-08-13 19:56:41 What defines a shredder bug is a fast moving, rocket propelled guidable projectile designed to tear apart the body of any build. Whether that build be a ship, plane, or another shredder bug.
general 2020-08-13 19:59:52 The biggest indicator of an unde is usually the way they act. By being immature, always act as if they are right, even if they are blatantly wrong, or post just general crap to cause issues.

general 2020-08-14 14:51:48 But that means I would have to uninstall my mods for awhile
general 2020-08-14 14:51:53 which isn't hard
general 2020-08-14 14:52:00 but it is a lengthy process
general 2020-08-14 14:52:52 But everyone would need the complete edition i think to play
general 2020-08-14 14:53:04 or at least the Cities of Tomorrow expansion
general 2020-08-14 14:53:25 since me and obc have the complete edition
general 2020-08-14 14:53:36 and i also have the standard game on a disc
general 2020-08-14 14:54:30 Simcity has somehow managed to go 4 years without an update but get not a single glitch
general 2020-08-14 14:54:44 well not 4 years
general 2020-08-14 14:55:09 last year some stuff were tweaked and new mansions were added
general 2020-08-14 14:59:24 <@!195253906333368320> if we end up doing the multiplayer region, are we going to coordinate and plan our cities to make the most efficient region possible, or will we go full on dystopia?I
general 2020-08-14 14:59:40 I know how to do either to unhealthy extremes
general 2020-08-14 14:59:43 yes?
general 2020-08-14 14:59:58 Coordinated dystopia?
general 2020-08-14 15:00:01 okay
general 2020-08-14 15:02:07 Bruh I need to memorize the names of the regions
general 2020-08-14 15:08:01 I think the complete edition is like 30 dollars
general 2020-08-14 15:08:41 but during thanksgiving week for black Friday and cyber monday it goes down to 15

general 2020-08-15 00:22:37 My dad is threatening to keep my boy brother here in Colorado while I go back just to see why he refuses to eat hardly any foods
general 2020-08-15 00:23:14 And because he thinks my mom would not care if we died
general 2020-08-15 00:23:33 Also autocorrect had a stroke
general 2020-08-15 00:23:48 hence why I said boy borther
general 2020-08-15 00:24:15 But why does my dad think the best idea too figure out
general 2020-08-15 00:24:20 omg
general 2020-08-15 00:24:26 my kindle isbhaving a stroke
general 2020-08-15 00:26:02 My dad thinks the best idea to figure out why my brother does not like most foods is too seperate him from me, our mom, our grandparents, our siblings, friends, school, or anything else we love. Not only is what he doing wrong, it is very illegal.
general 2020-08-15 00:26:33 The least concern being a logistical nightmare to do that
general 2020-08-15 00:27:37 Axi are you responding to what I said?
general 2020-08-15 00:29:42 If so, yeah, there are others that can. Yet my dad straight up discards every single good thing in Wisconsin other then the Green Bay Packers, so he has literally no trust in anyone there.
general 2020-08-15 00:34:14 Ask who?
general 2020-08-15 00:36:07 Luckily we are leaving in a week.
general 2020-08-15 00:36:15 and if my brother cannot leave
general 2020-08-15 00:36:37 My dad will probably be pile drived by legal issues

general 2020-08-15 00:39:08 I know nothing about scripting. I would only like to be like a moddeler or terrain designer for Plane Crazy.
general 2020-08-15 00:40:18 We literally just need the game re-write. The position would only be good for temporary patch work.
general 2020-08-15 00:43:06 I don't know nothing regrading Lua scripting. My mom even bought me a 100 dollar course on Lua scripting, and like I cannot grasp even the most basic kill script. I am more brick modelling, and even more terrain design.
general 2020-08-15 00:44:07 Why is <#497142796961054721> in slowmode and not <#384021699466756107>?

general 2020-08-15 00:59:30 Here is something incredibly stupid, start placing bets using your motor bucks or something to see if I get warned from Dm'ing Rick a year ago

plane-crazy 2020-08-15 02:30:48 Yeah votekick for vip servers is fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 02:32:08 since most vip servers are used by communities such as this, and well the reason for votekicking would be if someone is missbehaving. Which is, for the most part, against the rules here.

general 2020-08-15 22:33:16 But that also makes Russians, and Canadians furries
general 2020-08-15 22:33:33 Because they often wear heavy fur coats and hats to keep warm

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:05:12 <#623337136267067393> repor
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:05:48 lag machines work for those with weaker devices
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:06:10 No
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:06:29 Lag machines are actually pretty powerful
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:07:48 A phone has a weaker processor
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:08:54 Physics throttling is a like a neck cramp for a lot of games
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:05 Lag machines can be worse
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:24 But vip1 can still be bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:10:48 Only a couple times has vip1 crashed though
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:07 mainly from everyone spawning in a warship
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:14 It can ve
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:42 The block count can often reach more the 60k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:11:55 in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:12:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:12:42 like this 9 fold lag machine
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:13:00 that is not complete yet
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:13:46 Its 8.4k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:13:58 it does not lag except for spawning
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:14:08 but its more server lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:14:25 or when my computer tries to run multiple things at once
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:14:31 and gets heart burn
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:15:18 I have a gaming laptop for only 300 usd
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:15:24 and it works wonders
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:15:48 but it does not get 300 fps like most people want
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:16:21 I don't understand why people wish to have 120 fps or more
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:16:32 I am comfortable at 20 fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:17:33 I cannot see a difference above 30 fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:17:41 which is the limit of the eyes
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:17:47 30 fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:17:58 no i think its 30 fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:18:03 for 20-20 vision
general 2020-08-16 23:19:09 Its like customer service

general 2020-08-16 23:20:08 10/10 customer service
general 2020-08-16 23:20:45 Pinging a mod was better
general 2020-08-16 23:20:54 because always another mod will respond
general 2020-08-16 23:21:19 above is confusing

<@!573197570566782977> Yeah but thats not important to schools
general 2020-08-17 15:38:52 The freaking cold would get schools shutdown at this point
general 2020-08-17 15:39:30 Luckily school days are halved for our school
general 2020-08-17 15:41:45 I'm already worried because somebody made my high school schedule for me, but could not find the classes I choose, only because "Aspergers makes me incapable of caring for myself"
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 15:42:19 no
general 2020-08-17 15:43:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 15:44:40 OilyBorgar pig become literal ouly borgar
general 2020-08-17 15:47:10 I get headaches when im stressed, and also through wearing masks for a long time. Breathing in all the trapped gasses mixed with oxygen. So like, how am I supposed to do school? I explained to my mom why I liked online over in-school, but she choose in-school for the socialization.
general 2020-08-17 15:47:12 Like
general 2020-08-17 15:47:15 how soeak?
general 2020-08-17 15:47:43 How are you supposed to socialize in school. You have to wear your masks, and social distance
general 2020-08-17 15:48:10 You still rebreath some of the Co2
general 2020-08-17 15:49:30 I never said that it did not allow air to pass through
general 2020-08-17 15:50:14 My mom just does not want me playing games on my computer all day
general 2020-08-17 15:50:30 **even though**
general 2020-08-17 15:50:42 it is a much better alternative to going to school
general 2020-08-17 15:50:44 plua
general 2020-08-17 15:51:15 **I work much better online then in-school *without* the new rules**
general 2020-08-17 15:53:17 My mom says im being paranoid, yet if one of us catches covid, and she gets sick... **she may literally die**
general 2020-08-17 15:53:39 She has an auto-immune disorder which makes her much more vulnerable
general 2020-08-17 15:53:45 her doctor even said so
general 2020-08-17 15:55:41 Also if i get sick, i will be sent home, my brother will be sent home, and my mom will be sent home. My mom being a cook assistance at the elementary, having to leave would put the elementary in a troublesome position.
general 2020-08-17 15:57:36 yes
general 2020-08-17 15:59:37 My school is also doing sports and so are other schools, which forms a direct path for covid from a large city such as La Crosse, whos schools we compete with a lot.
general 2020-08-17 16:02:24 I don't like how my mom just went and sent both me and my brother in school, when we literally explained to her why we should not, coming up with every weakness in the system that puts us at great risk. Yet socialization, and how long I spend online being the determining factors against it. **The pros of online (at least for me) outweigh the pros and cons combined  of in-school**
general 2020-08-17 16:04:04 > Eh my school is in an area that has not been affected by corona much, they don't have as many regulations as a result so we're probably just going to do the government mandated stuff and nothing else.
<@!681140863845269602> same for our area. We only have had a total of 22 cases, but our school has direct contact with a city that has been plagued
general 2020-08-17 16:04:34 and direct contact with other schools that also have direct contact with the city

While also shunning my mom for getting a part time jon after threatening to get full custody for child neglect. All because he divorced her due to the fact she could not get a job because he did not care for us when we were younger, and she had too. And then he has to pay child support.

general 2020-08-18 15:38:08 pvp sucks
general 2020-08-18 15:38:52 Naval battles are the easiest and less glitchy but ships break up like glass
general 2020-08-18 15:39:49 fix plane crazy when
general 2020-08-18 15:41:55 Madattak either needs to help as much as he can, or freaking let rick hire someone
general 2020-08-18 15:42:30 i think madattak wants plane crazy to die so he does not have to worry
general 2020-08-18 15:43:15 Its like abandoning your baby in the forest because it does not look like you
general 2020-08-18 15:44:10 Or maybe madattak could convince Roblox to give ownership of Plane Crazy to rickje so he has control over it
general 2020-08-18 15:45:35 No its madattak fault
general 2020-08-18 15:45:50 Madattak needs to let rick hire people
general 2020-08-18 15:46:26 Madattak acts as if he owns the game and runs to whole system, yet he does not even care about the game
general 2020-08-18 15:47:23 What can we possibly do to get madattak to work on the game?
general 2020-08-18 15:48:00 The most we can do is somehow lead a coup that forces mad to acknowledge his game
general 2020-08-18 15:48:38 He would rather let his game die
general 2020-08-18 15:50:19 Maybe rick could put together a team of him, a scripter, block modeller, and a terrain artist, and just remake plane crazy from scratch
general 2020-08-18 15:51:21 He could just straight up hire someone to help if madattak did not have trust issues
general 2020-08-18 15:51:44 instead of having to ask someone and outsource
general 2020-08-18 15:52:00 which outsourcing means more room for game breaking bugs
general 2020-08-18 15:53:59 the original map contest was a big failure
general 2020-08-18 15:54:43 hire proto and sakura to hack the game and fix the bugs
general 2020-08-18 15:57:50 no torpedoes should not be added
general 2020-08-18 15:58:07 since warships are like made of freaking sandstone
general 2020-08-18 16:01:06 why is every person with unde like minds are either 13 or 18+
general 2020-08-18 16:04:16 <@!574608689315446794> can you go somewhere else. We are trying to have a conversation and you are just being an annoyance

plane-crazy 2020-08-18 16:44:40 yeah 100% totally true
general 2020-08-18 16:45:23 now everyone will agree
general 2020-08-18 16:45:33 with all the new covid rules and torture
general 2020-08-18 16:45:59 i am so not looking forward to starting
general 2020-08-18 16:46:13 and it being my first year of high school
general 2020-08-18 16:46:52 My school usually prepared us for the high school culture and rules in the last quarter
general 2020-08-18 16:46:53 but
general 2020-08-18 16:47:01 there was no last quarter
general 2020-08-18 16:47:12 so no one in my grade knows what and how to do
general 2020-08-18 16:47:27 on top of the new rules pertaining to covid
general 2020-08-18 16:47:48 this is going to be a crappy year

general 2020-08-18 16:48:25 nor do i want to be
general 2020-08-18 16:48:43 Nor can I join band
general 2020-08-18 16:49:12 The way my school does band interferes with custody issues
general 2020-08-18 16:49:16 so i cannot do band
general 2020-08-18 16:50:12 Im still mad at my mom for putting us into in-school
general 2020-08-18 16:50:56 I am stressed thinking about how im going to deal with the possible stress of in-school service

general 2020-08-18 16:51:41 I don't know if and when I can switch back
general 2020-08-18 16:52:16 **luckily** the school days are half days
general 2020-08-18 16:52:18 i think
general 2020-08-18 16:52:30 which means it will not be as difficult

general 2020-08-19 16:44:18 lets all verify under the yousaf name in memorial
general 2020-08-19 16:46:10 I have been in this server almost 2 years and have not a single rule, so getting banned for unwillingness to follow the rules would look like mod abuse kn your account yousuf.
general 2020-08-19 16:47:33 What if someone came in the server and verified with my name, what would happen then?

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:18:24 > I would like to discuss with the creator of this device on the subject of why and how there are floating half blocks kept down by ropes. *(Phase 1, initial detection)*
<@!311638025308209154> The creator was either one of two banned members of this server btw
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:19:53 i can never figure out how text blocks connect to other parts
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:24:10 <@!311638025308209154> The creator was either Prototrode, or A1SakuraA1. Both of which were perm banned from this server for exploiting. The build is a 6 bladed swashplate. A swashplate is a device to control the pitch and roll of a helicopter by manipulating the angle of the rotor and individual blades. Why it is so complex is a mystery, but the half blocks are held up by text blocks, and the ropes are used to control prop pitch (I think.)
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:26:05 really?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:26:15 I though sak was banned for exploiting as I have heard
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:26:29 and i have not seen sak in like forever
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:27:05 Nor have I seen sak online in the member list
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:28:30 that is a quarter of 2x2 cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 21:29:25 I think he means a 0.5x0.5 block cylinder

general 2020-08-20 02:21:01 That is cause that word is not in the filter
general 2020-08-20 02:21:12 If it was then it would be deleted
general 2020-08-20 02:22:21 But if you come up with a way to say a word without getting filtered, that would otherwise be filtered, would be bypassing
general 2020-08-20 02:23:30 Well the person who told you to make a butt bypassed and said it was not bypassing
general 2020-08-20 02:23:42 And i take a while to type because im on mobile

general 2020-08-20 02:34:29 but instead of a 3 page story
general 2020-08-20 02:34:42 i wrote 1/3 of  a novel
general 2020-08-20 02:35:15 But what helped is I already had the foundation of what the story would be before hand
general 2020-08-20 02:36:21 The setting I had already had
general 2020-08-20 02:38:01 A fictional place known as Paradise City in the province of Enid in the country of Paradise Island. (Note the city is not the capital. The capital is known as Silverdale farther north.)

general 2020-08-21 02:26:28 Okay but how did you run out of blocks?
general 2020-08-21 02:26:54 i have only used 200 on this
general 2020-08-21 02:27:04 how have you used almost all 2000?
general 2020-08-21 02:27:44 Can I see a pic of what you are building in <#384021699466756107> s
general 2020-08-21 02:29:17 yeah is why
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:29:33 2000 blocks...
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:29:43 Why have you not used beams
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:30:44 The problem is if you plan on getting a rank with it, you cannot as that will be seen as artificially increasing block count
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:31:45 I guess maybe you have an advantage in pvp as instead of entire beams being broke, it will one individual block
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:33:31 You can alternatively use blocks of different materials. For some reason they have separate limits
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:34:07 Also the limited blocks may be a code or Roblox limitations
general 2020-08-21 02:35:51 Floaty is either really lazy or has absolutely no talent in what he does
general 2020-08-21 02:36:01 or maybe he just does it for the exposure

general 2020-08-21 02:38:22 The youtubers that don't hace expert are some lf the worst
general 2020-08-21 02:38:38 That is why
general 2020-08-21 02:39:01 Expert rank requires experience and activity in chat, what most youtubers don't
general 2020-08-21 02:39:08 and when this is implemented
general 2020-08-21 02:39:17 and hopefully a purge happens

general 2020-08-21 02:50:52 It says in the pinned message that staff reserve the right to remove the rank for any reason
general 2020-08-21 02:53:07 It might be because there is a passive competition in the staff

general 2020-08-21 03:39:33 > why does no one have master sumpreme
<@!639390338133524481> master supreme requires all master roles, or having a HoF creation in all base roles (Shipwright, Aeronautical, Robotics, etc.)
general 2020-08-21 03:43:32 getting into HoF is like rolling a 20

plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:15:13 > I have a question. After i was shot down in pvp in my warship, it started to sink in the water. i have absolutly no ballast tanks or ballast blocks. Is it a new feature in plane crazy, or is it just a common bug? EDIT: none of the rocket engines were pushing it down either
<@!455915220737589259> It **may** be a bug. I have seen builds, including my own sink in the water and not float back up with nothing stopping it.
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:15:47 but other builds you cannot sink even at neutron star gravity

general 2020-08-23 03:06:59 > Who would win
<@!511260180583940108> The battleship would win. Heck a destroyer could win. The shear firepower of a warship cannot be matched by any land or air vehicle.
general 2020-08-23 03:07:40 A nuke would win
general 2020-08-23 03:08:01 Well War Thunder naval mechanics suck

general 2020-08-23 03:09:46 It can be a choice, but some poeple it come naturally
general 2020-08-23 03:11:01 How to thrown in front of a moving train 101: Downplay the military personnel and their sacrifices and losses
general 2020-08-23 03:12:09 Tbh to be openly LGBTQ is pretty a bold decision, but joining the military is like the ultimate sacrifice
general 2020-08-23 03:12:18 For you may never return
general 2020-08-23 03:14:09 How do you identify a feminist though?
general 2020-08-23 03:15:34 I get very angry at how some people hate cops just because they keep people safe
general 2020-08-23 03:17:03 creativ is not a fan of discussions like this
general 2020-08-23 03:20:14 I think what makes these more controversial discussions more common here is the fact that the only thing that can happen is you get muted or warned. Which is honestly better then outside in the public where you can be literally beaten. Or a more public chat room where people will dox you for having a different opinion.
general 2020-08-23 03:21:22 Tbh this server is like the only safe place to have these discussions since we are all, for the most part, civilized.
general 2020-08-23 03:21:40 Yes undes
general 2020-08-23 03:21:45 unde can not
general 2020-08-23 03:21:53 MFS?

general 2020-08-23 03:28:14 But that woman in the screenshot is dumber
general 2020-08-23 03:28:52 I honestly don't know how people can be like this
general 2020-08-23 03:29:16 Is there like a brain disease that some people can catch that makes them this way?
general 2020-08-23 03:29:27 or just horrible parenting
general 2020-08-23 03:29:51 But a lot of these people did not have parents that could cause this
general 2020-08-23 03:30:06 yeah but it also happens in men too
general 2020-08-23 03:30:31 Highschool girls it makes more sense
general 2020-08-23 03:30:42 But out in the public
general 2020-08-23 03:30:44 just
general 2020-08-23 03:30:47 **why**
general 2020-08-23 03:31:04 **HOW DO THESE PEOPLE FIND JOBS**
general 2020-08-23 03:31:25 **HOW DO MOST OF THEM SURVIVE**
general 2020-08-23 03:31:41 Have you seen how some of these people act when driving
general 2020-08-23 03:31:44 Its like
general 2020-08-23 03:31:50 they really want to die
general 2020-08-23 03:32:19 This is why i am an introvert
general 2020-08-23 03:32:25 and do not date
general 2020-08-23 03:32:56 I just straight up try not to have a conversation with anyone
general 2020-08-23 03:33:04 Out in public
general 2020-08-23 03:33:41 Like legit these people would choke someone to death and then sue them fo r endangering their fish
general 2020-08-23 03:34:41 If i could not experience pain i would probably just stay on my computer all day
general 2020-08-23 03:35:28 imagine making ceinj sketches
general 2020-08-23 03:36:10 Because bodily harm is bad
general 2020-08-23 03:36:32 a bad feeling associated with a bad cause
general 2020-08-23 03:36:56 If like you felt happy if you broke your femur
general 2020-08-23 03:37:08 wouldn't you break it more?
general 2020-08-23 03:37:20 Or any other bone
general 2020-08-23 03:37:57 If you were sick you would feel happy. If you are happy you might want to go out more.
general 2020-08-23 03:38:06 Now imagine that with covid
general 2020-08-23 03:38:38 It is good pain is bad
general 2020-08-23 03:38:45 Else we would have so many issues
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:39:42 How do I have 200 new messages?
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:40:19 But why was discord counting them individually
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:40:30 and not like the 50+ new messages
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:40:49 Because

plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:44:12 uuh show spawned at and angle

plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:00 yes helium
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:06 and not hydrogen
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:13 silly hydrogen
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:40 Well helium is put into balloons
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:47 which makes balloons float
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:49:47 Uuh try varying the combination of wedges instead of making a pattern like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:51:29 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/648254616529666090/678345784890097664/RobloxScreenShot20200215_150320215.png Something like this variation has allowed me to shape the hull better
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:51:44 It looks complex and messy
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:51:53 but it helped me quite a bit
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:52:08 at least for my first hull like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:53:16 I have not used motors on the hull as I had not figured out the basics of motor lock until the hull was pretty much done
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:53:50 but i plan on smoothing the hull out and using motor lock when i get back
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:54:53 It actually is really smooth with this all on top
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:55:26 That pic is the only pic i have from like February
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:55:34 of the hull
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:56:27 jay likes flashy white ships that have the radar signature of an airport and can be seen over the curvature of the earth
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:58:40 Okay imma go sleep now

general 2020-08-23 14:00:25 What do you like?
general 2020-08-23 14:01:57 I would say Coalesce but that is mildly slow
general 2020-08-23 14:02:17 its like a calming pvp game
general 2020-08-23 14:03:30 I cannot think of other games
general 2020-08-23 14:03:49 That require activity
general 2020-08-23 14:04:47 Except for Lumber Tycoon 2 and Space Mining Tycoon (or Simulator, cannot remember)
general 2020-08-23 14:05:45 You are probably thinking of a different game
general 2020-08-23 14:06:28 https://www.roblox.com/games/1598005680/Space-Mining-Tycoon?refPageId=cbce228f-3e1b-4bcc-a11d-69f0b72d09d9

general 2020-08-23 14:07:14 It is not a dropper tycoon
general 2020-08-23 14:07:39 It is a go out out and collect resources, process them and sell them
general 2020-08-23 14:08:36 It kind of is at the start
general 2020-08-23 14:08:59 but my brother somehow managed 500k cash on the most basic setup
general 2020-08-23 14:09:07 We

general 2020-08-23 14:10:12 I like Lumber Tycoon 2
general 2020-08-23 14:10:53 My base is basic because I was forced to build it on mobile
general 2020-08-23 14:11:00 its just a fancy block
general 2020-08-23 14:12:32 Why does everyone think I play on mobile?
general 2020-08-23 14:12:56 **I play on PC but im in Colorado so I have no PC**
general 2020-08-23 14:13:04 Galaxy is a chad game
general 2020-08-23 14:13:37 The NPC bases need a remake like all the ships and player starbase
general 2020-08-23 14:13:59 It can be grindy until you get high tier miners
general 2020-08-23 14:14:29 Such as Roqual, Mammoth, **Meme** Class, and Orca

general 2020-08-23 14:27:14 Speaking of nightmares
general 2020-08-23 14:27:24 I had a dream that really was not a nightmare
general 2020-08-23 14:27:34 I am too stupid to have nightmares
general 2020-08-23 14:30:42 But like I was in this dystopia-ish underground city, with a government which I swear had a dependency for illegal substances. So like I was with a group of people in like this arena, like a huge laser tag arena but instead of laser tag it was us trying to kill each other with whatever we could.
general 2020-08-23 14:30:55 So we were doing that
general 2020-08-23 14:31:58 But halfway this huge snake like creature the size of an aircraft carrier blasts through the floor around the arena and just starts attacking everyone
general 2020-08-23 14:32:10 Completely random
general 2020-08-23 14:33:53 And because the gover had brain damage or something they made us deal with the snake. We had no choice in the matter so we did, and it attacked us.
general 2020-08-23 14:35:14 I think sometimes god wants to make me have a nightmare or something
general 2020-08-23 14:35:21 and my brain is like

general 2020-08-24 14:49:03 here is all green, blue, yellow, purple, pink, red, brown
general 2020-08-24 14:52:15 Also all the smoke from Colorado wildfires is blowing all the way down here
general 2020-08-24 14:52:56 You could see the layer of smoke sitting on the ground, and up to ~15,000 feet in the air the entire 2 hour flight from Denver to Minneapolis
general 2020-08-24 14:53:25 And then the haze on the ground the 3 hour drive from Minneapolis to my place
general 2020-08-24 14:54:08 I guess Interstate 70 was closed off in places where the fire was raging
general 2020-08-24 14:54:34 Bruh did my computer even shut down?

general 2020-08-24 14:59:44 My dad says there is nothing interesting in Wisconsin, yet Colorado is either flat, dead grassland, or forest of deep green pine trees
general 2020-08-24 15:00:07 The only interesting thing is the mountains which you see a lot of, and the cities
general 2020-08-24 15:00:51 Yes

general 2020-08-24 16:16:19 **youtube let me watch videos at not 144p**
general 2020-08-24 16:37:00 Apparently the more internet I use, the faster War Thunder updates
general 2020-08-24 16:37:19 War Gaming is European
general 2020-08-24 16:37:23 but not Russian
general 2020-08-24 16:39:43 I would imagine they would want to take most the feedback from Russian players, as well, being that close to Russia as they are. Kinda a little scary. At least in my opinion
general 2020-08-24 16:40:06 Pog War Thunder finished updating
general 2020-08-24 16:40:27 Anti Air can be quite fun tbh

general 2020-08-25 05:25:14 but like how to land without touching the ground
general 2020-08-25 05:25:56 **But I don't know. The P-61 do be a fun plane even at stock configuration.**
general 2020-08-25 05:29:43 makes sense
general 2020-08-25 05:30:09 Those match results though
general 2020-08-25 05:31:31 I feel like I don't need the 20mm cannon replacements for the Black Widow
general 2020-08-25 05:31:54 The default ammo belts are so loaded that one shell can tear apart a bomber
general 2020-08-25 05:32:00 No need for accuracy
general 2020-08-25 05:32:18 Just shoot and the inaccuracy will do the rest

general 2020-08-25 20:38:23 I used to play that game a lot
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:16:48 okay **why is my ship still broken in the game**
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:20:11 Why is my ship sinking so far now? Also why does do water props now propel the ship backwards instead of forwards?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:20:22 Also why are the turrets actually working properly?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:20:34 **Rick what the heck did you do to the game**
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:21:04 What?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:21:16 Reversed propellors?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:27:52 Where is the super soaker?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:30:16 bruh this scared me when it came flying at me
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:30:47 How did it break through the glass though
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:31:09 > imagine only getting the items now
You try not having a computer for 3 months
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:31:35 But the glass is like 8 inches thick
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 21:31:59 Plane Crazy mobile is a war crime tbh
general 2020-08-25 21:35:55 Fun fact: Sprite is my most favorite soda

general 2020-08-25 22:20:09 Low tier america is pretty good
general 2020-08-25 22:20:11 Not the best
general 2020-08-25 22:20:16 but still pretty nifty

general 2020-08-26 04:34:43 yes
general 2020-08-26 04:35:04 Somebody say something out of context
general 2020-08-26 04:35:41 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-08-26 04:36:09 I have yet to update minecraft
general 2020-08-26 04:36:15 So i cannot try
general 2020-08-26 04:36:31 plus i just loaded War Laughter
general 2020-08-26 04:41:21 Ahh to bad War Thunder does not have a Mission Editor with European based bombing missions
general 2020-08-26 04:41:31 Or Mission Editor for tanks and ships
general 2020-08-26 04:41:40 would be very nice
general 2020-08-26 04:45:11 That B-17 do be hurt
general 2020-08-26 04:46:37 speaking of flame
general 2020-08-26 04:46:52 The best way to take out a B-17 is with another B-17
general 2020-08-26 05:00:18 i literally just updated my computer and now you are saying I need to update again?
general 2020-08-26 05:44:52 look ma i found a cool car
general 2020-08-26 06:04:36 I dunno
general 2020-08-26 06:05:19 I sleep though
general 2020-08-26 06:05:28 And update my computer
general 2020-08-26 06:05:37 All the mods are dead rip
general 2020-08-26 16:11:34 I just got this message from someone who is not in any of the servers I am in, or has the same friends as me. I should not be getting Dm's from people who are not in any server I am in
general 2020-08-26 16:11:57 I am also not 18 so that message does not even apply to me
general 2020-08-26 16:15:46 who is cranediger?
general 2020-08-26 16:58:19 he is ide
general 2020-08-26 17:07:53 So my first match of the day was lost in 2 minutes
general 2020-08-26 17:08:48 That basically sums up my luck in War Thunder
general 2020-08-26 17:13:47 Okay we lost again
general 2020-08-26 17:14:04 And my ping is at like 60,000
general 2020-08-26 17:17:42 Calling someone a noob in War Thunder because their team lost is quite a dumb thing to do tbh
general 2020-08-26 17:18:01 My first match I was the last one against the whole team
general 2020-08-26 17:18:19 Which was an uptier against Germany and Russia
general 2020-08-26 17:18:39 On maps with a horrible open spawn
general 2020-08-26 17:22:04 Bruh my is so **freaking high**
general 2020-08-26 17:22:11 I legit cannot play
general 2020-08-26 17:22:44 I literally got a side shot on a Tiger H
general 2020-08-26 17:22:49 like perfect broadside
general 2020-08-26 17:22:57 **and it bounced**
general 2020-08-26 17:23:20 **and then I got packet lossed into his shot
general 2020-08-26 17:23:34 then got put into a field
general 2020-08-26 17:23:48 but my team is doing so bad right now
general 2020-08-26 17:23:58 we are being spawn camped
general 2020-08-26 17:24:27 **HOW HAVE MY FIRST THREE MATCHES INVOLVED ME GETTING KILLED BY LAG AND MY TEAM SPAWN CAMPED IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES**
general 2020-08-26 17:25:38 That happens so often
general 2020-08-26 17:25:43 It is not even funny
general 2020-08-26 17:26:31 Gaijin is starting to commit a rickje moment
general 2020-08-26 17:26:35 fix and add one thing
general 2020-08-26 17:26:42 everything else breaks
general 2020-08-26 17:27:47 War Thunder will not fix the servers because it does not involve new premiums
general 2020-08-26 17:29:00 I don't think the fact that everyone else is playing Fortnite and using tiktok helps with the internet situation
general 2020-08-26 17:30:58 China I hear is an actually fun nation to play and grind
general 2020-08-26 17:33:18 I have also been having a lot of lag spikes
general 2020-08-26 17:33:42 Like for some reason War Thunder requires more processing power then usual
general 2020-08-26 17:33:55 I had to lower my graphics quality a tad bit
general 2020-08-26 17:34:34 I run War Thunder and Plane Crazy at the frames
general 2020-08-26 17:34:48 except WT has plenty of lag spikes
general 2020-08-26 17:35:00 I know
general 2020-08-26 17:35:19 No i get lag spikes of around 3 fps
general 2020-08-26 17:35:35 And ping spikes of more then 999 for minutes at time
general 2020-08-26 17:36:44 > my laptop is more like a portable desktop because it dies when i unplug it
sounds like my brothers computer
general 2020-08-26 17:37:46 You know the issue is with getting 120 fps is that most of us cannot afford to get a computer that can run it
general 2020-08-26 17:37:51 Same for getting fast internet
general 2020-08-26 17:38:01 that stuff is honestly expensive for most people
general 2020-08-26 17:39:11 I have a gaming laptop too, with the same results
general 2020-08-26 17:39:41 Its honestly better then my old computer which could run Agar.io at 5 fps
general 2020-08-26 17:39:44 max
general 2020-08-26 17:40:20 Im literally going broke from loosing so much
general 2020-08-26 17:40:27 and getting pinged to death
general 2020-08-26 17:40:38 I also cannot hear tanks even when they are yelling in my ear
general 2020-08-26 17:41:54 **bruh why am i getting 5 fps in the hanger rn**
general 2020-08-26 17:45:13 Gaijin needs to balance repair costs with the vehicle, and then balance a vehicle. The cost of a vehicle does not change how big its gun is.
general 2020-08-26 17:50:54 **HOLD UP**
general 2020-08-26 17:51:23 **WHY IS THE B-29 REPAIR CAN 6.3K, AND NOT 40K**
general 2020-08-26 17:54:22 Google results show this
general 2020-08-26 17:54:31 by quora
general 2020-08-26 17:55:07 But it would be better to look at a doctor's research
general 2020-08-26 17:55:19 or anyone else in that field of study
general 2020-08-26 17:58:25 I am not finding any credible research that proves any of what we say. So as of now, we are all wrong.
general 2020-08-26 18:00:12 
general 2020-08-26 18:00:57 I am still trying to figure out what the exact number is
general 2020-08-26 18:01:01 or at least a proven range
general 2020-08-26 18:02:01 The current approximation is around 30 fps
general 2020-08-26 18:04:29 Yeah what I am finding is that your eyes cannot process over at most 50 fps
general 2020-08-26 18:04:36 So :/
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 18:06:24 Puri simps for his carrier
general 2020-08-26 18:14:24 bruh I swear someone really hates me playing war thunder
general 2020-08-26 18:14:53 whatever I do, i always die
general 2020-08-26 18:14:55 just die
general 2020-08-26 18:14:56 die
general 2020-08-26 18:15:01 and more dying
general 2020-08-26 18:15:19 Not instantly
general 2020-08-26 18:15:30 but i get killed whenever I try to go places
general 2020-08-26 18:15:33 and help my team
general 2020-08-26 18:15:42 yes
general 2020-08-26 18:15:46 same in naval
general 2020-08-26 18:15:49 same in air
general 2020-08-26 18:15:53 same in custom
general 2020-08-26 18:15:58 same in mission editor
general 2020-08-26 18:16:18 but like someone let my entire freaking team go by
general 2020-08-26 18:16:20 6 tanks
general 2020-08-26 18:16:22 4 heavies
general 2020-08-26 18:16:25 2 mediums
general 2020-08-26 18:16:29 and me in a light tank
general 2020-08-26 18:16:38 gets killed by the same person **twice**
general 2020-08-26 18:16:46 when my entire team went by before me
general 2020-08-26 18:17:21 **Im going freaking broke**
general 2020-08-26 18:17:26 **because I cannot do anything**
general 2020-08-26 18:17:34 my team gets to go places
general 2020-08-26 18:17:37 cap points
general 2020-08-26 18:17:39 kill enemies
general 2020-08-26 18:17:45 i can get sent to the hanged
general 2020-08-26 18:18:01 **heck it even applies to ground assualt**
general 2020-08-26 18:18:11 Even there ia have the worst luck
general 2020-08-26 18:18:56 And I see other youtubers saying you should be fine as long you dont get american based teams
general 2020-08-26 18:18:58 and like
general 2020-08-26 18:19:22 OP??
general 2020-08-26 18:19:31 Wdym op?
general 2020-08-26 18:20:13 Yeah dont aim down at the lower glacis
general 2020-08-26 18:20:22 dont on most vehicles
general 2020-08-26 18:20:27 it is the same for all nations
general 2020-08-26 18:20:37 Transmission and optics best armor
general 2020-08-26 18:21:50 Why do people say germany suffers? They have the best freaking tanks that kill, and cannot be killed. Same goes for the fighters. Powerful weaponry, heavy armor, good mobility.
general 2020-08-26 18:22:30 Yeah but they can just as well
general 2020-08-26 18:22:41 plus they have a low silhouette
general 2020-08-26 18:22:59 unlike the shermans which are taller tank
general 2020-08-26 18:34:41 5 battles in a row
general 2020-08-26 18:35:07 Our team lost and I did almost nothing because I am downtiered and killed really quickly
general 2020-08-26 18:36:37 Why is it I always get uptiered?
general 2020-08-26 18:36:53 Like everyone is always better then me
general 2020-08-26 18:36:56 And only me
general 2020-08-26 18:37:31 5.7
general 2020-08-26 18:37:39 but i have the same issue with all br's
general 2020-08-26 18:58:47 me
general 2020-08-26 18:59:36 Are those torps?
general 2020-08-26 19:06:23 If only I could actually afford to crew it
general 2020-08-26 19:06:40 And have SL left over
general 2020-08-26 19:09:04 Yeah I heard the Duster is bad
general 2020-08-26 19:46:46 > Can I make a map and then send it to rickje
<@!454809803223465984> Highly unlikely that he would accept it
general 2020-08-26 19:52:25 Still unlikely
general 2020-08-26 19:52:50 Rick would rather be wanting to fix bugs then install a new map

general 2020-08-28 17:32:17 I know that
general 2020-08-28 17:32:39 but I think it might be the only ship in War Thunder to have that installed
general 2020-08-28 17:49:19 I like how in naval arcade, someone always comes in to strafe or bomb me, knowing that Italian ships (the tech tree I am grinding) has no AA or secondary armament in the first tier, so instead I use my main guns, which they never expect me to do. So they die

general 2020-08-29 06:13:30 preferably stellar mass
general 2020-08-29 06:15:00 > Black hole?
<@!502211422718263307> You know. That large body in space that formed from a star collapsing into a point so small that it just kept collapsing into a singular point in space. It also has enough gravity to slow, even stop time.
general 2020-08-29 06:15:32 Well you need a star
general 2020-08-29 06:15:41 or a hadron collider
general 2020-08-29 06:17:26 For the star you can either find a red super giant, or find a star with a mass of 10 suns or more, and just wait. For the hadron collider, just smash a bunch of atoms together at really freaking fast speeds and hope you get a sub-atomic sized black hole that will only last for a fraction of a percent of a fraction of a millisecond.

general 2020-08-30 05:11:04 fvl you know buying higher tier vehicles before you actually get to that tier is a bad idea
general 2020-08-30 05:11:13 I have no 7.0 vehicles
general 2020-08-30 05:11:28 my highest br is 5.7 or 5.3
general 2020-08-30 05:11:35 Easy
general 2020-08-30 05:11:41 build a custom plane
general 2020-08-30 05:11:48 It is straight forward
general 2020-08-30 05:11:53 just use your imagination
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:14:24 Water props are way heavier then they need to
general 2020-08-30 05:28:14 that game
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:30:12 Bruh using water props just makes my ship sink really far, and makes it tilt so much
general 2020-08-30 05:35:13 Well at least the R3 is at a BR which it is better at
general 2020-08-30 05:35:27 instead of 3.3 where the only thing it cant pen are russian heavies
general 2020-08-30 05:35:40 everything else is like paper
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:53:19 I should really get Ultimate Admiral Dreadnoughts and like use that to design ships I may want to build in plane crazy before hand
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:53:27 To get a base design
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:53:40 and get better statistics on the ships
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:53:57 instead of making best guesses
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:55:27 <@!527653676022628353> Yeah I already watch him
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:55:44 But like I want the game for myself
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:55:53 but it needs modding capabilities
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:56:11 So I can design Paradian ships more exact
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:56:36 and actually make the super heavies such as the Linvia class battleships
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:57:42 With the 12 18.8 inch guns (9 on the Aspenae,) max speed of 42 knots (max in the game currently is 36) and special citadel design
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:57:49 that really is not a citadel
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:58:41 The citadel is a just a mess of angled armor plates to deflect shots from vital components
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:59:12 I mean like everything to make the Linvia class battleship needs to be modded into the game
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:59:23 except the secondary armament
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 05:59:44 and stuff such as range finders, radars, propellent, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:00:04 I also need to figure out how to make it in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:00:38 I do plan on making the flagship sometime, but I will need multiple accounts
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:00:46 for a ship that big

general 2020-08-31 16:24:15 If all the guards shoot the prisoners for eating to food incorrectly
general 2020-08-31 16:25:18 The last time I played prison life with you, yesterday, I had to phase through the walls just to escape
general 2020-08-31 16:25:28 Since I kept getting shot at

general 2020-08-31 16:27:02 I would not have if I had a chance to actually get out of the cell block
general 2020-08-31 16:27:54 The only way that event would have been fun, if I had joined the guards team
general 2020-08-31 16:28:35 And get shot?
general 2020-08-31 16:29:00 **When I said I kept getting shot by everyone I meant I kept getting shot by everyone**

general 2020-09-01 04:26:16 okay
general 2020-09-01 04:26:34 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-09-01 04:27:24 proof of hof vote rigging
general 2020-09-01 04:28:14 puri bias
general 2020-09-01 04:28:41 purifiedbias15
general 2020-09-01 04:29:08 but tbh I think you really should not be doing that for hof
general 2020-09-01 04:29:43 hof builds should have fair voting
general 2020-09-01 04:29:54 Yeah
general 2020-09-01 04:30:12 but you said you downvoted to just be a troll
general 2020-09-01 04:31:09 mac gun?
general 2020-09-01 04:31:28 Oh
general 2020-09-01 04:31:34 the lag gun
general 2020-09-01 04:31:37 yes
general 2020-09-01 04:31:49 yamapo
general 2020-09-01 04:48:19 Yeah I am very sure naval is more my style
general 2020-09-01 04:48:51 Too bad the research is horribly unbalanced
general 2020-09-01 04:49:33 I should sleep too
general 2020-09-01 04:49:43 tomorrow is my first day of school
general 2020-09-01 04:49:51 specifically high school

general 2020-09-01 04:53:05 > When people take screenshots of their pc screens to send their creations in <#384025409945337856> ***WHEN THEIR IS A FUCKING ROBLOX BUILT IN FEATURE TO TAKE SCREEN SHOTS, SCUZE ME BUT... WHAT THE FUCK***
<@456226577798135808> On top of that they can use the snipping tool, gyazo, and various built-in keybinds to take a screenshot
general 2020-09-01 04:56:54 <@!720891502108344360> I was talking about naval tech trees
general 2020-09-01 04:58:28 Research in a naval be like: Tier I: 60k, Tier II: 600K, Tier III: 100K, Tier IV: 400k
general 2020-09-01 04:59:04 Gaijin could not have done that at their own will
general 2020-09-01 04:59:25 Something like that is like a broken wrist
general 2020-09-01 04:59:29 you cannot ignore it
general 2020-09-01 04:59:41 Naval has few premiums though
general 2020-09-01 04:59:50 it would make more sense in air and ground
general 2020-09-01 05:00:32 The only nation not effected is Italy
general 2020-09-01 05:00:47 The research there makes much more sense
general 2020-09-01 05:01:13 Italian ships are amazing though
general 2020-09-01 05:01:35 The early 20mm guns are kinda meh
general 2020-09-01 05:01:43 but the ships themselves are really good and gun
general 2020-09-01 05:02:06 The reserve boat has a max speed of 120 km/h in arcade
general 2020-09-01 05:02:16 and like 90 in realistic
general 2020-09-01 05:02:19 that is like
general 2020-09-01 05:02:32 rocket boat
general 2020-09-01 05:02:55 It outspeeds jet powered hydrofoils
general 2020-09-01 05:02:58 at reserve tier
general 2020-09-01 05:03:12 the only downside is it has no front gun
general 2020-09-01 05:03:18 so you are shooting out the sides and back
general 2020-09-01 05:03:37 and it is so fast aiming can be difficult till you get used to it
general 2020-09-01 05:03:51 also waves
general 2020-09-01 05:04:09 hitting waves at 100 km/h is like the ultimate stress test on the hull
general 2020-09-01 05:04:19 also whiplash
general 2020-09-01 05:04:38 snapping spinal cords since 1939
general 2020-09-01 05:05:00 learn to aim
general 2020-09-01 05:05:27 really depends on the situation
general 2020-09-01 05:05:56 naval is more strategy then ground and air
general 2020-09-01 05:06:02 so you need bigger brain
general 2020-09-01 05:06:23 When you are being focused then it is best to retreat
general 2020-09-01 05:06:38 if you cannot retreat
general 2020-09-01 05:06:40 then
general 2020-09-01 05:06:46 kamikaze banzia
general 2020-09-01 05:07:14 Okay I really need to go to sleep
general 2020-09-01 05:07:34 I already have to wake up 3 hours early
general 2020-09-01 05:08:24 The biggest ship you can pilot in-game in the Graf Spee
general 2020-09-01 05:08:33 the biggest ship in-game is of course
general 2020-09-01 05:08:35 the Yamato AI
general 2020-09-01 05:09:04 Well one person can control a battleship
general 2020-09-01 05:09:14 it is just a chonky cruiser
general 2020-09-01 05:09:42 It would be similar to that gameplay
general 2020-09-01 05:10:04 Yeah
general 2020-09-01 05:10:19 AA gunners are really accurate even when they are not leveled up
general 2020-09-01 05:10:38 Same for secondary gunners
general 2020-09-01 05:11:09 well
general 2020-09-01 05:11:29 secondary can be inaccurate with higher calibers
general 2020-09-01 05:11:56 But higher calibers often come with variable fuse shells
general 2020-09-01 05:12:00 aka radio shells
general 2020-09-01 05:12:16 or proximity fuse shells
general 2020-09-01 05:12:23 what ever the heck you want to call them
general 2020-09-01 05:13:09 But the AA armament of even the in game cruiser, such as american heavies, has the AA armament the rivals the airbases
general 2020-09-01 05:13:18 but even more accurate
general 2020-09-01 05:14:11 sandwich

<@!615356321340063784> Our septic line exploded into our kitchen and living room once
general 2020-09-02 03:54:45 so we could not use any water for a while
general 2020-09-02 03:54:56 else we would flood the house
general 2020-09-02 03:55:42 Also one time our electricity went out due to a breaker malfunction
general 2020-09-02 03:55:47 for 2 days
general 2020-09-02 03:55:58 so 2 days without any electricity
general 2020-09-02 03:56:12 We had no A/C
general 2020-09-02 03:56:15 In north dakota

general 2020-09-02 03:56:41 our only heating was a pellet stove
general 2020-09-02 03:56:53 when the average night temp was -10
general 2020-09-02 03:57:27 One night we lost electricity during one of the coldest days of the year
general 2020-09-02 03:57:31 so we had no heat

general 2020-09-02 21:32:11 > gaijin boutta ruin their naval player bois
<@!221487880487436288> Yes, but these ships are either expensive premiums, or put at the end of the tier II research line. Their RP and SL costs is equivalent of a top tier heavy cruisers which have 12 heavy artillery
general 2020-09-02 21:32:16 of 200mm or more
general 2020-09-02 21:32:31 Plus secondary and AA armament

general 2020-09-02 22:10:43 fires actually burn in the correct location now
general 2020-09-02 22:10:55 also that can happen
general 2020-09-02 22:12:27 and if i remember this was once a premium
general 2020-09-02 22:12:34 now it is a tier III aircraft
general 2020-09-02 22:12:44 and it replaced my P-51A
general 2020-09-02 22:12:45 sad
general 2020-09-02 22:13:14 however it can outspeed most aircraft of its BR
general 2020-09-02 22:13:17 even at stock
general 2020-09-02 22:16:00 the P-51C do have good acceleration
general 2020-09-02 22:16:10 also <#384021699466756107> rickje
general 2020-09-02 22:17:25 Yeah the P-51C is going to need a higher BR
general 2020-09-02 22:20:12 Jesus the P-51C has incredible performance
general 2020-09-02 22:20:17 it is just a cheap P-51H
general 2020-09-02 22:22:18 > Oh shoot they added Sweden
<@!320183380702658560> They did like a year ago
general 2020-09-02 22:23:13 Hmm
general 2020-09-02 22:23:15 Okay
general 2020-09-02 22:23:32 Why can I not my one wing flight test
general 2020-09-02 22:23:43 whenever I hit a tree or something to take a wing off
general 2020-09-02 22:23:54 even if it just gets the tip
general 2020-09-02 22:24:03 i get kicked out of the plane as if my pilot died
general 2020-09-02 22:24:33 like i do not even get a chance to correct my flight or fall to the ground
general 2020-09-02 22:24:36 it just kicks you out
general 2020-09-02 22:24:50 hold let me hop into a custom battle
general 2020-09-02 22:26:37 yes and no
general 2020-09-02 22:26:42 optomization yes
general 2020-09-02 22:26:46 more save slots no
general 2020-09-02 22:26:51 I build way to slowly
general 2020-09-02 22:29:31 **YEAH YOU JUST GET KICKED OUT WHAT THE HECK**
general 2020-09-02 22:29:34 That is so unfair
general 2020-09-02 22:29:49 You cannot get hit anymore
general 2020-09-02 22:30:07 else you risk loosing part of the wing and getting kicked out of the battle
general 2020-09-02 22:56:42 woah
general 2020-09-02 22:56:49 new camoflauges

general 2020-09-03 03:53:31 this message
general 2020-09-03 04:19:15 You know how in War Thunder arcade battles if you like zoom in with a target locked it points the gun at the target
general 2020-09-03 04:19:20 well now it is tanks rb
general 2020-09-03 04:19:31 and it nearly got me killed 5 times in one match
general 2020-09-03 04:19:39 Hi Axipoo
general 2020-09-03 04:27:31 Bruh whenever you right click when zoomed in sniper mode for tanks
general 2020-09-03 04:27:57 it automatically locks on to a the nearest place and focuses your gun on it
general 2020-09-03 04:28:03 incredibly stupid
general 2020-09-03 04:28:12 why would gaijin ever implement it
general 2020-09-03 04:28:19 and there is no way to disable it
general 2020-09-03 04:29:12 or no
general 2020-09-03 04:29:21 actually i could just change the keybinds
general 2020-09-03 04:29:31 **but why is it a feature**
general 2020-09-03 04:29:42 i guess it makes since for AA gunners against aircraft
general 2020-09-03 04:30:28 locking onto makes the gun(s) automatically follow the aircraft while you just have to lead the target accordingly

general 2020-09-03 05:04:34 the turret is better stock then the M19
general 2020-09-03 05:04:49 at least it feels and looks that way

general 2020-09-04 20:32:51 No kids allowed
general 2020-09-04 20:33:51 The term kid is usually used for someone younger then you
general 2020-09-04 20:34:01 but yeah
general 2020-09-04 20:35:29 Age 15 is when you can drive, age 18 is when you are considered independent and gain almost all rights, age 21 you can drink alcohol, and age 25 is when the brain is fully mature
general 2020-09-04 20:36:13 Around age 30 is when you stop growing
general 2020-09-04 20:36:30 > no 27,
<@!318291033626771457> That is around 30
general 2020-09-04 20:37:37 what is under 13 though?
general 2020-09-04 20:38:18 > so you can be a kid without being a minor
Maybe in college you could still be considered a kid
general 2020-09-04 20:38:37 But really a kid is just a label
general 2020-09-04 20:38:44 its more point of view
general 2020-09-04 20:38:48 unless you are a goat
general 2020-09-04 20:39:57 506 studs

plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:08:15 for my next build
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:10:34 My ideas:
Paradian Avin Aeronautics Air Hound twin engine bomber
Lady of the River Air Hound flown by Nelson Velomon
Paradian Falcon Modern MBT
Paradian Opra Class destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:10:44 I don't know which one to do
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:11:55 They are all custom names
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:12:00 custom stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:12:07 I cant build from a phote
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:12:46 The Opra would be a remake of this original ship
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:13:08 old

plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:14:30 Yeah the Falcon is a modern MBT
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:14:46 With a 122 mm gun and a top speed of 65 km/h
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:16:05 Yeah I would be building a production varient
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:16:17 So it saw a lot of service
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:17:43 Well the tank is custom
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:17:58 The best idea you can get of the design would be the German Leopard tanks
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:24:10 If you have been is this server enough you would understand just enough to have an idea of what im talking about
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 21:24:37 Or If you lived with me to know the backstory behind my imaginary nation of Paradise Island

general 2020-09-10 00:00:56 The most realistic you can get is force limited fuel, limited ammo, damage resistance for certain materials, fire resistance, density, ammo detonation and fires, fuel explosions and fires, and realistic weapons damage. Also blocks do not be deleted unless hit by a projectile close the size of the block, or big boom. Wood, grass, and what not could also disappear by fires. Also don't forget less wing drag and actual weapons
general 2020-09-10 00:02:08 Motivation or determination?
general 2020-09-10 00:02:22 See you can have no motivation, but a lot of determination

general 2020-09-10 00:11:14 http://thunderskill.com/en
general 2020-09-10 00:11:43 My win rate just keeps dropping what the heck
general 2020-09-10 00:12:52 I wonder
general 2020-09-10 00:12:54 eheye yhreyrh
general 2020-09-10 00:13:02 I feel like doing something
general 2020-09-10 00:13:13 About Plane Crazy and War Thunder
general 2020-09-10 00:14:18 🤔
general 2020-09-10 00:16:22 
general 2020-09-10 00:17:15 For some reason on June 6 every War Thunder player was a noob
general 2020-09-10 00:17:30 what is your name?
general 2020-09-10 00:18:09 
general 2020-09-10 00:18:29 Try going to the statistics tab and put in your username
general 2020-09-10 00:19:06 I just want to point out that on the skill chart
general 2020-09-10 00:19:25 The average player was considered to be a bad player on June 6
general 2020-09-10 00:19:46 and the average efficiency of simulator battles fell into the inactive range
general 2020-09-10 00:20:37 I make fancy rocks
general 2020-09-10 00:20:41 that is all I do
general 2020-09-10 00:21:54 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-09-10 00:22:55 Haters are my motivators moment going on here
general 2020-09-10 00:23:33 I think Expired would be to stubborn to fail in this case
general 2020-09-10 00:31:39 I am trying to improve my efficiency
general 2020-09-10 00:31:55 But I used to be so bad that I am struggling
general 2020-09-10 00:32:22 and if your team looses, either because of lack of common sense, a wrong move, or just shear luck
general 2020-09-10 00:32:26 you take a huge hit
general 2020-09-10 00:32:46 > learn how to a n g l e
<@!456238251204935690> Imagine playing 1000 matches and not knowing how to angle
general 2020-09-10 00:33:51 I started playing RB at an early time
general 2020-09-10 00:34:01 but not before knowing the basics
general 2020-09-10 00:34:29 You can say the same for Arcade
general 2020-09-10 00:35:10 The only difference in Arcade is you get enemy markers, aim markers, and tanks move faster
general 2020-09-10 00:35:13 that is it
general 2020-09-10 00:35:41 Tanks RB, and tanks AB are not very different
general 2020-09-10 00:35:49 When it comes to Air
general 2020-09-10 00:36:02 Then you need **absolute chonk** brain
general 2020-09-10 00:36:27 Or just be a good at learning from seeing and listening
general 2020-09-10 00:56:52 what new tank?
general 2020-09-10 00:57:00 wha totnrkmt
general 2020-09-10 00:57:17 Noice
general 2020-09-10 00:58:28 Oh
general 2020-09-10 00:58:32 It is NSFW
general 2020-09-10 00:58:50 makes sense but doesnt make sense
general 2020-09-10 00:59:36 Wait but how exactly makes that NSFW?
general 2020-09-10 01:00:08 Oh
general 2020-09-10 01:00:10 makes sense
general 2020-09-10 01:00:54 If they use it as an insult just say it is a tank destroyer
general 2020-09-10 01:00:57 and they cannot fight you
general 2020-09-10 01:01:01 cause you are right
general 2020-09-10 01:01:15 they can only do salty unde moves that have no effect
general 2020-09-10 01:02:37 What BR are you?
general 2020-09-10 01:04:18 Am 6.0
general 2020-09-10 01:05:46 WELL I WAS MURDERERING GREEN

general 2020-09-10 01:26:27 herisson is now epic gamer squad
general 2020-09-10 01:26:52 I should play Plane Crazy more
general 2020-09-10 01:27:29 Imagine if he is trying to sleep and he just hears all the ping noises
general 2020-09-10 01:27:52 we could just spam his Dm's instead
general 2020-09-10 01:27:56 so no spam in here
general 2020-09-10 01:28:49 > <@!335599526414909451> next contest custom military builds

general 2020-09-10 01:29:20 I dont like most the contests
general 2020-09-10 01:29:31 which is why I dont participate in them
general 2020-09-10 01:29:36 they done do be the poo
general 2020-09-10 01:29:49 I can make my bedroom

general 2020-09-10 01:31:10 We have a ghost in <#504718138399522832>
general 2020-09-10 01:32:17 I never entered into a contest
general 2020-09-10 01:32:25 They never appeal to me
general 2020-09-10 01:32:29 except the one puri denied
general 2020-09-10 01:32:44 **THE FREAKING CUSTOM ONLY CONTESTS**
general 2020-09-10 01:32:54 Or military
general 2020-09-10 01:33:21 **Anything that is military based so I can commit Paradian Power™️**
general 2020-09-10 01:33:43 Custom only military contest
general 2020-09-10 01:33:58 I have an excuse to build the Paradian Falcon MBT
general 2020-09-10 01:34:01 Or the Fairy
general 2020-09-10 01:34:07 or Air Hound
general 2020-09-10 01:34:30 and a couple others that I cant remember
general 2020-09-10 01:34:43 That moment when your favorite song randomly plays
general 2020-09-10 01:37:27 I still need to get a video of my ship
general 2020-09-10 01:37:33 bruh I really do not want too
general 2020-09-10 01:37:42 **its too painful**
general 2020-09-10 01:38:05 The turning is so bad due to the physics lag and what not
the-dump 2020-09-10 01:38:34 Smoke Signals
the-dump 2020-09-10 01:38:52 <@!708064765770989568> Actually squad markers are the best
the-dump 2020-09-10 01:39:02 you can go into the settings and make a keybind
the-dump 2020-09-10 01:39:13 point at the area you want and click the button
the-dump 2020-09-10 01:39:35 and a marker will appear around that area that all your squad mates can see
general 2020-09-10 01:40:33 wait
general 2020-09-10 01:40:47 Wasn't it a rule you need to demonstrate your vehicles mobility?
general 2020-09-10 01:40:52 in a video
general 2020-09-10 01:41:28 **Wait that means I dont have to make a video of the ship turning**
general 2020-09-10 01:41:46 I just need to spawn it in and show it is stable
general 2020-09-10 01:42:12 But my ship has a list due to the water props for some reason
general 2020-09-10 01:42:24 it is never an issue without water props
general 2020-09-10 01:42:40 but my ship does not capsize so I dont think I would be in violation
general 2020-09-10 01:43:16 <@!335599526414909451> wdym by military engineering vehicles?
general 2020-09-10 01:43:31 okay
general 2020-09-10 01:44:03 Oooh okay
general 2020-09-10 01:44:40 So I can make a Paradian war time track laying vehicle
general 2020-09-10 01:46:17 It is essentially a tank that can lay tracks, not like full on railroad tracks, but like temporary tracks for transportation of heavier equipment that might be too heavy for ground vehicles, or to replace aircraft in dangerous evironments
general 2020-09-10 01:46:29 Sound like a good idea?
general 2020-09-10 01:46:42 **OH no worse idea**
general 2020-09-10 01:46:47 The Sherman Broom
general 2020-09-10 01:47:34 I can make this
general 2020-09-10 01:48:02 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2020-09-10 01:49:17 
general 2020-09-10 01:49:32 Someone needs to make that
general 2020-09-10 01:49:44 We can have an army of Sherman mine clearers
general 2020-09-10 01:49:58 
general 2020-09-10 01:50:08 It appears it was real

general 2020-09-10 04:15:57 <@456226577798135808> Might wanna actually go to the server you want to post that in
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:17:37 Where can you extend the deck though?
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:17:41 Over the bow?
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:17:47 That might look a little wonky
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:20:42 That might look a little off

general 2020-09-10 04:32:36 Who needs a fluffy pillow when you have a box
general 2020-09-10 04:33:07 📦 ➡️ 🇧🇷
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:37:39 **Okay why are water props so heavy**
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:38:00 The superstructure of my ship is filled with helium and fabric pontoons in the hull
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:38:36 And for some reason this is what I get left with
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:39:17 I am trying to get this ship turning better so I can make a video of it to get an expert rank for it and submit it for HoF
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:39:25 even though it wont get into HoF
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:39:28 Still worth a shot
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:40:17 Right now it is just straight up impossible to get the expert rank since water props are so heavy
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:40:51 You have to sacrifice what it needed to get a rank just to make the ship work
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:42:14 
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:42:23 Good angle
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:43:24 I removed the bow and stern water props to lighten it up
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:43:34 but now it may be unbalanced
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:43:57 like 7 blocks I think
the-dump 2020-09-10 04:45:29 NSFW
the-dump 2020-09-10 04:45:38 Well he cannot die
the-dump 2020-09-10 04:45:43 cause no mod is alive

plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:47:03 😕
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:47:53 Half of those blocks dont exist on the build
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:49:40 it seems better
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:51:21 https://gyazo.com/e28828efa1c7c8513f12241551ede27b LET ME FREAKING MAKE MY SHIP WORK WITHOUT SOMETHING BREAKING SWEET MOTHER OF JOSHEPH
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:52:04 I need to like the set the motor torque to zero else it spazes out
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:52:21 and the bow to 100000 torque just so it does not bounce
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:53:09 I am like so frustrated trying to fix this ship
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:53:47 I just want to show a pic of the propulsion units inside the ship as proof it can move
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:54:11 **These ships can hardly work with physics due to their size**
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:54:38 Its amazing that some of these ships have pvp capabilities
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:55:25 How did I gain 3k data from deleting 30 blocks from the climbing tower
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:55:46 Plane Crazy do be best game
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:55:54 > when did you last save it
<@!615356321340063784> a minute ago
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:56:15 I deleted 30 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:01:05 <@!335599526414909451> When you are online, can I *please* just show pics of the propulsion units in my ship to get expert shipwright, and submit it for HoF (even though it will not get in for sure.) I am having troubles with Roblox physics and game glitches interfering with actually making the turning fast enough to see it moving. Random issues with the ship sinking to the deck, or a random piece becoming sentient. Knowing that there is a way the ship can turn would be easier then me actually fixing the small bugs that are Roblox's fault and you watching a 20 minute video of me trying to turn my ship. Also don't expect me to respond soon after since I have school until like 2:30 P.M. CDT
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:01:17 I have auto save disabled
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:01:36 and a 8k warship is no way going to take up at least 3k data
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:01:49 the ship takes up 80k alone
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:03:08 Okay I sleep
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 05:03:13 also bye

plane-crazy 2020-09-10 20:48:08 just trying to make it eligible for the freaking rank
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 20:49:52 It was perfectly balanced before
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 20:50:16 but now just trying to give it faster turning has messed it up so badly

<@!712273624865701921> They are
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:26:44 and so are drones
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:27:17 VTOL stands for Vertical Take-off and Landing
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:27:25 So if you build is designed for that
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:27:29 it is a VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:28:11

general 2020-09-14 03:34:17 I need a routine
general 2020-09-14 03:34:42 I have aspergers which makes me really trash without a routine
general 2020-09-14 03:34:50 makes me inefficient
general 2020-09-14 03:35:10 and quick last second changes bother me
general 2020-09-14 03:35:41 The only routine I have is in the morning and through school
general 2020-09-14 03:35:55 after that it is sort of whatever
general 2020-09-14 03:36:09 Just do what needs to be done whenever
general 2020-09-14 03:36:53 I did not want to return to school, then school started and I liked it
general 2020-09-14 03:37:00 but then the homework started coming
general 2020-09-14 03:38:48 Worrying about getting to classes on time, having all the stuff you need, worrying about homework, doing chores, worrying about what the weather is going to be so I can dress appropriately, covid regulations, who is going to win the next elections, and then my freaking dad
general 2020-09-14 03:38:49 my

general 2020-09-14 03:39:09 I cannot describe him without getting banned
general 2020-09-14 03:39:48 All that put into one thing, paired with my aspergers is like walking with a nuclear bomb in your backpack
general 2020-09-14 03:40:01 And you cannot leave the nuclear bomb behind
general 2020-09-14 03:40:05 it is always with you
general 2020-09-14 03:40:12 and it could detonate at any moment
general 2020-09-14 03:40:46 Pakistan is just a figment of your imagination

general 2020-09-14 03:44:07 Also my step-mom quit her teaching position after 12 years in the same school cause the new principle had literally no experience and was creating all these rules, that made it **literally impossible** for the teachers to get anything done
general 2020-09-14 03:44:44 yes
general 2020-09-14 03:45:41 Just know when we all start making our little armies they going to be making jokes about this pandemic

general 2020-09-17 20:10:28 and my school is planning on doing a hybrid schedule if covid cases keep rising (as if threatening that is going to help)
general 2020-09-17 20:22:35 <@!389756407483990028> Meaning that half the students go in for Monday and Tuesday, and the other half on Thursday and Friday. If you are not in-school you have to do online. Which is an impressive that anyone could make that decision as either they want to die, or are just really dumb. Carrying all the stuff you need back and forth from home to school, and keeping track of it all is the poopoo. Same for the teachers who have to keep track of us all

general 2020-09-17 20:45:09 <@!579035683314991130> Also take into account that Roblox filter is kinda poo
general 2020-09-17 20:45:26 Also his brain is extremely developed for a 3 year old
general 2020-09-17 20:46:01 **Yes he born 3 years ago which makes him 9 years old**
general 2020-09-17 20:46:24 > imagine being dumb enough to add your own age to roblox
<@!579035683314991130> Imagine lying about your age
general 2020-09-17 20:50:01 <@!579035683314991130> Let me put this together. A number got tagged from a person's perspective, and that somehow makes them unde. He says his account birthday is set for the year of 2017, making them 3 years old, and that counts as proof somehow. Since 3 years have developed full english skills and a vocabulary. Then you say they are 9 years old after they said their account birthday was in 2017. Also note his english skills are way better then yours, and he is making actual sense.
general 2020-09-17 20:50:27 Okay then your accusations are false
general 2020-09-17 20:50:33 If you have no proof
general 2020-09-17 20:50:46 **Then show the proof**
general 2020-09-17 20:50:55 Also proofs is not proper english
general 2020-09-17 20:51:05 You just posted the same thing
general 2020-09-17 20:51:16 That is one piece of evidence
general 2020-09-17 20:51:42 You have literally no evidence that proves he is unde except one filtered word
general 2020-09-17 20:52:01 And the fact he can read gay is

general 2020-09-17 20:55:15 He said he does not set his real age
general 2020-09-17 20:55:28 Which looks more suspicious then setting your birthday to 2017

general 2020-09-18 04:06:05 Half the vehicles I had researched I had not bought yet until I get 1 mil SL from a battle crate
general 2020-09-18 04:06:12 and that allowed me to catch up
general 2020-09-18 04:06:24 then I started getting better and was pulling in the money
general 2020-09-18 04:06:34 but I was kinda broke
general 2020-09-18 04:06:47 and paired with being able to get new vehicles faster did not help

general 2020-09-18 04:10:01 but it was half the time
general 2020-09-18 04:10:20 Also imagine playing meta vehicles just for gains and not funs

general 2020-09-18 04:11:37 could do single missions
general 2020-09-18 04:12:02 or if I want I could do custom battles even though I won't be getting any gain from it
general 2020-09-18 04:12:12 except for maybe fun and skill
general 2020-09-18 04:12:26 Imagine playing just to flex your stats
general 2020-09-18 04:13:12 I has the fun
general 2020-09-18 04:14:10 I was playing with Vix. I was in the jumbo, he in some russian AA boi. We would race around corners and disable guns and light targets, and I would jump out when the enemy was distracted
general 2020-09-18 04:14:35 of course I would get this map while I am broke
general 2020-09-18 04:31:17

general 2020-09-19 04:24:15 Well you have vehicles made in the 1980's at BR 3.3
general 2020-09-19 04:24:19 So like
general 2020-09-19 04:24:46 Its really based on the median
general 2020-09-19 04:25:37 Plus I also made that preset a while ago before I figured out when the vehicles were made
general 2020-09-19 04:26:30 Yeah the T95 is quite much for WWII
general 2020-09-19 04:28:35 I wonder why the T28 is a .7 br rating lower then the T95 when they are the same vehicles except one has more treads
general 2020-09-19 04:29:32 No
general 2020-09-19 04:29:44 The top speed is the same
general 2020-09-19 04:30:05 It might be that the T28 is less popular relative to the T95
general 2020-09-19 04:30:25 and Gaijin does not know how to properly balance vehicles

general 2020-09-19 21:44:29 <@!723419054114865202> Why did you come around a corner, right before fonkl died, and then back away after he died
general 2020-09-19 21:44:38 You did not report the body or anything
general 2020-09-19 21:44:45 Or do an emergency meeting

general 2020-09-19 21:47:07 You were hiding around a corner, jumped out, and killed him. Backing away right away

general 2020-09-21 00:45:01 You did better in one tank then I do in an entire match with meta vehicles
general 2020-09-21 00:45:36 <@456226577798135808> Look at the burn marks on the ground
general 2020-09-21 00:45:50 He just got japan'ed
general 2020-09-21 00:46:51 > 15 in m18
<@456226577798135808> Why though
general 2020-09-21 00:46:59 You have literally no armor
general 2020-09-21 00:47:23 Take max shells so if you explode next to enemy they get damaged
general 2020-09-21 00:47:28 or you make big boom
general 2020-09-21 00:47:54 You mean like the American M18?
general 2020-09-21 00:47:58 BUt chinese version
general 2020-09-21 00:48:11 Bruh you have some luck
general 2020-09-21 00:48:21 a low tier could one shot you
general 2020-09-21 00:48:25 37mm
general 2020-09-21 00:48:28 or even lower
general 2020-09-21 00:48:44 That is what you are supposed to do
general 2020-09-21 00:48:54 Also that tank almost never reaches its top speed
general 2020-09-21 00:49:06 Unless you find a long stretch of paved road
general 2020-09-21 00:49:34 It has poor traction with its small tracks
general 2020-09-21 00:50:14 I have never seen the M18 get covered like that
general 2020-09-21 00:50:25 Did you like dig it up out of the sand or something
general 2020-09-21 00:50:53 wut
general 2020-09-21 00:51:05 Yes
general 2020-09-21 00:51:26 > What gives more thrust, super rocket engine or jet engine
<@!257004924699672576> russian bias and conveyor drives
general 2020-09-21 00:51:42 Jets sucks
general 2020-09-21 00:51:45 So do super rockets
general 2020-09-21 00:51:52 But the super rocket is the best
general 2020-09-21 00:51:57 out of those two

general 2020-09-21 00:53:41 I just have not
general 2020-09-21 00:54:12 Your graphics look higher too
general 2020-09-21 00:54:38 **but even then I have not seen any tank be covered in so much sand even on movie graphics**
general 2020-09-21 00:55:34 Why is it literally everyone always gets uptiered
general 2020-09-21 00:55:43 and not the people who get downtiers
general 2020-09-21 00:56:22 Like so many people get uptiered that there are no downtiers, yet how the heck do you get uptiered with no downtiers for everyone else
general 2020-09-21 00:57:43 Oh yeah the original does have a sandy tint to it
general 2020-09-21 00:57:53 Plus the sand cover
general 2020-09-21 00:57:59 yeah that makes sense
general 2020-09-21 00:58:18 **but that also begs for the question, why have i never seen it like that**
general 2020-09-21 01:00:56 I still cannot get over the fact that I got a talisman for the P-51 and P-61
general 2020-09-21 01:01:11 Bruh

general 2020-09-21 01:09:59 <@!177743269105500160> Disable auto repair
general 2020-09-21 01:10:05 You will save a lot of SL
general 2020-09-21 01:11:28 This is what we have in Wisconsin
general 2020-09-21 01:11:55 and this
general 2020-09-21 01:12:11 and also this
general 2020-09-21 01:12:39 and this for some reason
general 2020-09-21 01:13:46 This is also summer in a nutshell here in Wisconsin
general 2020-09-21 01:13:55 meal time
general 2020-09-21 01:14:49 we also have this
general 2020-09-21 01:15:13 We has fluffy cow
general 2020-09-21 01:15:33 Fluffy little cows
general 2020-09-21 01:16:15 We also have this fine specimen
general 2020-09-21 01:16:41 He could also have a color filter on
general 2020-09-21 01:16:52 Such as the vibrant color filter
general 2020-09-21 01:17:13 It makes colors pop out more
general 2020-09-21 01:17:24 It is good for low quality
general 2020-09-21 01:17:29 makes details stand out more
general 2020-09-21 01:17:42 it also makes nights and shadows darker
general 2020-09-21 01:17:53 which can be troublesome sometimes
general 2020-09-21 01:18:44 This is a good example of the vibrant color filter
general 2020-09-21 01:18:57 Notice how the shades are darker and the green pops more
general 2020-09-21 01:19:08 > you wouldnt spot that
<@456226577798135808> Not at first glance
general 2020-09-21 01:19:29 Yeah
general 2020-09-21 01:19:30 I like it
general 2020-09-21 01:21:10 > <@456226577798135808> people dont notice my hetzer in snowmaps
<@!221487880487436288> (haha double ping) For some reason tanks can be harder to see on snow maps. Possibly because rock formations and other map items look like a tank on snow maps
general 2020-09-21 01:22:27 <@456226577798135808> It could be easy to spot the tank if you have good eyes, know all the tricks in the book, or if you just look closer
general 2020-09-21 01:22:55 I would not have spotted in a split second, but something like that would catch my attention
general 2020-09-21 01:23:08 I have an eye for detail naturally
general 2020-09-21 01:23:54 I got 1 mil SL a couple days ago from a daily reward
general 2020-09-21 01:24:16 and now I am currently working on grinding out the tier IV american aviation tree
general 2020-09-21 01:24:35 So I should walk away with a half mil to 2 mil SL gain
general 2020-09-21 01:24:57 You can get so much SL from air RB it is ridiculous
general 2020-09-21 01:25:27 An average match brings 20,000 sl from one air kill, for at least tier IV
general 2020-09-21 01:25:47 Plus having disabled auto repair
general 2020-09-21 01:25:52 you can save a lot of SL
general 2020-09-21 01:26:03 while making a lot more bank
general 2020-09-21 01:26:54 Expert qualification?
general 2020-09-21 01:26:55 noice
general 2020-09-21 01:27:39 > Prices are based off of player winrates/performance
Lets beat the system and purposely loose in all the expensive vehicles
general 2020-09-21 01:27:44 make them cheaper
general 2020-09-21 01:28:21 So cost can only increase?
general 2020-09-21 01:28:43 Then why did you say it will never happen?
general 2020-09-21 01:29:46 The only things you cannot pen are the front and mantlet unless at close range
general 2020-09-21 01:30:41 It has more armor then the Jumbo which can bounce even shots from a german 105
general 2020-09-21 01:30:48 What makes it so bad
general 2020-09-21 01:31:23 Yeah the queues suck
general 2020-09-21 01:31:34 Yeah probably
general 2020-09-21 01:31:58 But then you would have to deal with uptiers to 8.3
general 2020-09-21 01:32:37 wUT
general 2020-09-21 01:32:40 You cannot
general 2020-09-21 01:33:23 The only tank I fear at my BR is the one I cannot see
general 2020-09-21 01:33:50 I think that allies should be divided based on BRs
general 2020-09-21 01:33:55 Not overall game
general 2020-09-21 01:34:52 So like BR 6.3 and below should not have the Russians and Germans fighting together, and the Japanese and Americans together. As 6.3 and below is mainly World War tanks
general 2020-09-21 01:35:22 okay bye imma bye
general 2020-09-21 01:35:56 <@456226577798135808> Eventually you learn how to work in an uptier
general 2020-09-21 01:36:29 Like I get uptier constantly to 6.7 where I am literally lacking in everything
general 2020-09-21 01:36:48 and I learn how to actually contribute to my team, by at least distracting enemies
general 2020-09-21 01:37:06 I learned the weak spots on enemies, their strengths and weaknesses
general 2020-09-21 01:37:14 and play with them
general 2020-09-21 01:52:29 > thats what i do against jagdtigers and is-3 <@!505835349889777685>
<@!177743269105500160> Jagdtigers you are definitely not going to pen frontally unless you have a good shot. Otherwise you would have to first take out the gun barrel, and take out the tracks so ir cannot move. After that it is flank and spank. If it is a long range engagement, just retreat back into cover and engage another target. Nothing you can really do at range.
general 2020-09-21 01:53:42 For is-3's I could not tell you as I have had few encounters with that tank, but if you cannot pen it frontally, then use the same tactic as above
general 2020-09-21 01:54:30 In fact use the same tactic for any tank you canno t pen frontally
general 2020-09-21 01:59:14 I also killed my first Me 264 today
general 2020-09-21 02:01:22 I was side climbing, and he was side climbing, and by shear luck we ran into each other, and I was below him. With my 8 .50 cals I tore apart his wings, knocked off a flap and elevator. While setting **3** fires.
general 2020-09-21 02:01:42 I live in Wisconsin

general 2020-09-22 04:01:23 My mental health is totally degrading
general 2020-09-22 04:01:40 I can hardly concentrate on anything without feeling overwhelmed
general 2020-09-22 04:01:55 Little things can ruin my entire day
general 2020-09-22 04:02:19 I can no longer read or watch the news just to stay sane
general 2020-09-22 04:02:43 And I am getting constant headaches and I just always feel sick
general 2020-09-22 04:03:53 I try to avoid medicine as much as possible
general 2020-09-22 04:04:07 I would rather get better naturally
general 2020-09-22 04:04:20 It feels a lot better when you heal naturally
general 2020-09-22 04:05:14 Well politics just annoy me
general 2020-09-22 04:05:38 It is more all the covid junk, wildfires, weather, and other natural disasters

general 2020-09-22 04:08:34 Covid is just a fancy flu
general 2020-09-22 04:09:12 Covid is just a extroverted flu with manners
general 2020-09-22 04:09:37 The economy was already screwed
general 2020-09-22 04:10:19 An economic collapse was going to happen in the next 10-20 years
general 2020-09-22 04:10:26 Covid just made it happen now
general 2020-09-22 04:10:44 Or it at least is preparing us for the actual collapse
general 2020-09-22 04:11:33 Silver prices are rising at crazy rates
general 2020-09-22 04:11:45 A troy ounce is 40 bucks
general 2020-09-22 04:11:51 a couple years ago it was half that
general 2020-09-22 04:22:05 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
general 2020-09-22 04:26:39 I just feel so sick right now
general 2020-09-22 04:26:51 And it is not like an actual sickness
general 2020-09-22 04:27:13 Yeah
general 2020-09-22 04:27:38 But like I have been feeling nauseas for the past few days
general 2020-09-22 04:28:14 Doctors are too expensive
general 2020-09-22 04:28:25 plus my dad is going to find some way to go to court over it
general 2020-09-22 04:29:27 Meds are what I want to avoid
general 2020-09-22 04:30:10 It is not going to kill me
general 2020-09-22 04:30:17 but dying naturally sounds nice
general 2020-09-22 04:34:00 I might have to also avoid school since a lot of it is just so much stress and anxiety
general 2020-09-22 04:34:28 whenever I get to the point I am at now where I am sick and getting constant headaches I just need a break from everything
general 2020-09-22 04:34:40 get a chance to recuperate
general 2020-09-22 04:36:58 Cause like going to school right after spending the summer at my dads, his constant arguments against my mom and living here which could actually make him loose visitation over us, my first year of high school, Covid, and the fact that my English teacher reminds of my dad (which makes me think I may PTSD) is way to hard on me
general 2020-09-22 04:38:11 On top of that the protests are slowly spreading to this area, the extreme spike in kidnappings here (which are not limited by age) and my Aspergers Syndrome
general 2020-09-22 04:38:37 All that is a dam waiting to burst
general 2020-09-22 04:39:23 I just straight up need at least a month break from everything and to be able to do my own things
general 2020-09-22 04:40:58 Our school is also going to move to an A/B/O schedule which is also going to affect me physically on top of mentally
general 2020-09-22 04:43:49 Maus in Armored Patrol oh no
the-dump 2020-09-23 04:11:20 Bruh I saw that video on OurTube today

general 2020-09-23 04:52:04 100% activity if you count climbing and actually setting up for an attack you could actually win
general 2020-09-23 04:52:47 It never seems the count unless the bullets fly past an enemy target
general 2020-09-24 04:52:10 This is some interesting stuff
general 2020-09-24 04:52:24 That front panel is the oil filter and cooling
general 2020-09-24 04:52:37 that sort of bag behind the pilot is a fuel tank
general 2020-09-24 04:52:48 and the engine is a spiral
general 2020-09-24 04:53:00 it do be interesting though

general 2020-09-25 04:38:47 Yeah cause there are similar
general 2020-09-25 04:39:05 WoWS can be stressful so I assume the same for WoT
general 2020-09-25 04:39:24 And well my experience with War Thunder arcade
general 2020-09-25 04:39:48 You all harass arcade players for being noob and then you play arcade
general 2020-09-25 04:41:45 **I got 300 crew points from one battle what the heck**
general 2020-09-25 04:42:15 Gaijin needs to fix volumetric formula

general 2020-09-25 04:43:37 You can get armor values of 1000 on some mid tier tanks if you shoot in the right spot
general 2020-09-25 04:43:59 No idea why the thickest armor does not count only
general 2020-09-25 04:44:30 German tanks have an emphasis on "tank"

general 2020-09-26 23:07:44 Yeah but actually we really do need new mods. Even if all the options are not mature enough. They just need to know how to react to stuff.
general 2020-09-26 23:08:44 Luckily obc stayed when rick asked
general 2020-09-26 23:08:50 Then this server would be worse

plane-crazy 2020-09-28 16:30:02 her?
general 2020-09-28 16:43:29 The more I play against Germany in War Thunder air matches, the more I think there is legit some bias for them. Their bombers are incredibly strong. Even unrealistically strong, whilst American bombers snap apart at the slightest touch, and yet IRL they could take beating that no other bombers could. German bombers can outspeed even Mustangs. Their defensive armament will chew up fighters. And I have set **3 fires** on a 264 just and all three were put out in a couple of seconds. Yet American fighters struggle to put out fires even when diving at 700+ km/h with self sealing tanks.
general 2020-09-28 16:43:31 Like bruh
general 2020-09-28 16:44:11 Why we posting plane crazy in general?
general 2020-09-28 16:44:57 > he sucks at WT
<@!304977711988867072> No German bombers are unrealistically strong and my luck is just a dream.
general 2020-09-28 16:45:40 My skill does effect being outrun by bombers and the enemy putting out 3 fires in a couple of seconds at 200 km/h
general 2020-09-28 16:47:09 Yes but how the heck do you manage to put out 3 fires, while American aircraft struggle to put out a single fire in a wing ripping dive, engine off, and self sealing fuel tanks. (Some aircraft even have extinguishers)
general 2020-09-28 16:48:25 This is just a trick

general 2020-10-01 15:53:27 Or do I just write down what I want
bot-central 2020-10-01 15:56:07 -mapsuggest Detailed sea beds. Such as maybe coral like formations, or rock formations. Would make for good hiding places when it comes to new event blocks. It would also provide more reasons for building subs, and maybe shipwrecks. It would also look better then the rough terrain that has grass growing on it.

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:31:11 And the interesting thing is there was a ghost block mirrored to the same side
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:31:15 but that went away
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:31:43 and this one will not go away even after reloading the creation, resetting, and leaving and rejoining
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:34:25 Okay it was not a ghost block
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:34:36 It just would not let me put a motor on top of another motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:34:51 I had to place the top one before the bottom one

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:49:29 and doing a rewrite might be too difficult

general 2020-10-03 19:40:48 I got a freaking 28% in science because of two assignments that never went through. I was not notified that anything was missing till after midterm grades, when it was way too late. A week too late. On top of that assignments were marked missing in the automated emails that were returned by teachers, so that they could be used for future reference. I am feeling sick from having to deal with highschool, it being my first year, my freaking dad trying filet my mom, covid, and allergies that I legit never had before. There is legit nothing I can do to make myself feel better other then take a break, and then fail all my classes.

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:20:09 No my concern is that I have not participated in contests cause I thought the entries had to be real

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:21:43 Paradian bombers were decorated, but did not have camo except for formal events
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:22:48 I need to figure out where to put the airforce insignia

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:24:14 Jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:24:27 That thing would sacrifice armor and speed for gun
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:24:45 and if a fire broke out or a shell detonated in the ammo
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:25:13 probably 10 knots
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:25:16 or 5
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:25:19 5-10 knots
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:30:09 That thing reminds of my Linvia class super battleships, that were not nearly as ambitious with weaponry. With only 3/4 18.8"/50 main guns, 2/4 9"/40 secondary guns, 2/4 5.5"/30 secondary, 4/4 40mm Grand Piano AA guns, 2/6 22mm AA guns (tommy and miranda auto feed setup,) and 1/4 22mm AA guns (tommy auto feed setup.) On a ship that moves up to 37.5 knots.
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:30:30 but there is literally only 100mm of citadel armor at its thickest point
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:30:40 if you can even say the ship has a citadel
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:32:04 It is merely a complex system of angled steel plates protecting the engines and ammo stores

general 2020-10-05 16:01:33 <@!389756407483990028> The top speed is dependent on stuff such as altitude, engine heat, temperature, drag from damage or cooling elements, and fuel load. If conditions are perfect then you will reach your top speed in level flight

general 2020-10-05 16:03:14 Such as with most German aircraft

general 2020-10-06 04:52:57 Self voting is illegal
general 2020-10-06 04:53:02 there is never a good reason
general 2020-10-06 04:53:38 Did he remove it just now?
general 2020-10-06 04:54:09 Could have upvoted to get him closer to enough votes
general 2020-10-06 04:54:17 then removed it when he achieved his wish
general 2020-10-06 04:55:08 But my question is how did it get into HoF?
general 2020-10-06 04:55:19 Compared to all other tanks, that one is mediocre
general 2020-10-06 04:55:28 Would get you maybe 30 upvotes
general 2020-10-06 04:55:52 There is not that much detail
general 2020-10-06 04:56:08 You can see exposed motor heads under the turret
general 2020-10-06 04:56:14 the lighting is distracting
general 2020-10-06 04:56:46 The position where the photo was taken is kinda wonk because the canyon has little detail
general 2020-10-06 04:57:10 Well actually the tank has quite a bit of detail
general 2020-10-06 04:57:24 but compared to the stuff you often see in vip1 and expertvip
general 2020-10-06 04:57:34 Complaining about the tank in HoF
general 2020-10-06 04:58:05 I don't think it should have gotten HoF compared to some tanks that have no achieved HoF
general 2020-10-06 04:58:52 Plus the screenshots were taken by someone who has HoF voting privileges
general 2020-10-06 04:58:56 So there might be some bias
general 2020-10-06 04:59:30 Also wasnt there like some sort of rule against edited screenshots?
general 2020-10-06 05:01:39 Im just respected, but that is it
general 2020-10-06 05:01:42 Nothing more, nothing less
general 2020-10-06 05:02:33 I mean it is not a bad tank, but it is not HoF worthy in my opinion
general 2020-10-06 05:02:36 like not at all

general 2020-10-08 04:19:45 > American prop planes are ass
<@!177743269105500160> Excuse but what is wrong with spading an entire tier. Also american props do not suck what so ever. The same concept to play american props also applies to jets. Energy fighting.
general 2020-10-08 04:20:33 Yeah side climb
general 2020-10-08 04:20:48 Then you just have horrible luck
general 2020-10-08 04:21:14 Or you are not as aggressive with side climbing as you should be
general 2020-10-08 04:21:30 Side climbing with american props requires you going decently far out
general 2020-10-08 04:21:55 plus if you run into someone you cannot beat, turn away and pick up speed
general 2020-10-08 04:28:05 <@!177743269105500160> So from what I know you like turn fighting
general 2020-10-08 04:28:11 Right?
general 2020-10-08 04:29:53 You do realize that jets are going to be the same thing
general 2020-10-08 04:30:05 maybe worse until you get higher tier jets
general 2020-10-08 04:30:39 Not really
general 2020-10-08 04:31:33 Yeah it turns like a warship
general 2020-10-08 04:31:40 but it has the firepower of one
general 2020-10-08 04:31:52 And it has a lot of speed
general 2020-10-08 04:32:15 Assuming the enemy is clueless to your presence
general 2020-10-08 04:32:23 Or they are a bomber or slow
general 2020-10-08 04:33:31 Eh this plane has some really good characteristics
general 2020-10-08 04:33:52 can out perform most aircraft of its BR
general 2020-10-08 04:34:44 Not really
general 2020-10-08 04:34:53 Some planes do not lock up
general 2020-10-08 04:35:05 Compression is a issue that you cannot avoid though
general 2020-10-08 04:37:20 Bet you cannot figure out my favorite aircraft
general 2020-10-08 04:39:30 > How do you get on its ttail
<@!177743269105500160> 0 throttle in a controlled dive and hope they do not have radar eyes
general 2020-10-08 04:39:38 Also aim as best you can
general 2020-10-08 04:39:58 run .50 cals with tracer belts if the tracer belt is the API-T varient
general 2020-10-08 04:40:10 and drop the net to catch all that SL and RP
general 2020-10-08 04:41:03 You can do that by playing with your throttle in a rolling scissors or other maneuver
general 2020-10-08 04:41:07 try not to get shot
general 2020-10-08 04:41:14 and you should be fine
general 2020-10-08 04:41:22 also keep you speed up so you dont die
general 2020-10-08 04:41:28 be fast but slower then the enemy

general 2020-10-08 04:44:06 If you are getting frustrated, take a break, or play something else. Else you perform worse then your aircraft possibly can
general 2020-10-08 04:45:00 Yes sea battles can pull 30g's when it comes to matches
general 2020-10-08 04:45:04 and your emotions
general 2020-10-08 04:46:32 > Cant show
I can see why, but it would also be nice to know what we cannot say so we do not run into any trouble saying something that we are not supposed too. Does V0xel not let you show it?
general 2020-10-08 04:49:37 <@!437078588701933568> What shell from what tank?
general 2020-10-08 04:50:25 > Well swedes are op
<@!177743269105500160> In my opinion the nation as a whole is balanced. When you get into individual vehicles it is interesting.
general 2020-10-08 04:50:58 Who decided stock HEAT was a good idea?
general 2020-10-08 04:51:47 Oh yeah
general 2020-10-08 04:51:53 The economy update
general 2020-10-08 04:51:58 it be pog tbh
general 2020-10-08 04:52:41 American repair costs are becoming more balanced
general 2020-10-08 04:53:42 My only question is why is the Phantom cheaper to repair then Mustangs and Lightnings
general 2020-10-08 04:54:02 Like the F4E has a 10k less repair cost then the D-30
general 2020-10-08 04:55:18 Who said that you cannot die in top tier else you loose money?
general 2020-10-08 04:55:46 Top tier tanks cost as much to repair as tier III planes
general 2020-10-08 04:56:23 Spaded repair cost of the Mustang D-30
general 2020-10-08 04:57:25 I guess repair cost of modifications is a bit high for top tier jets
general 2020-10-08 04:57:43 But as long as you get a kill or two
general 2020-10-08 04:57:47 it will pay off
general 2020-10-08 04:58:01 Why does the what now?

general 2020-10-08 04:59:26 Shoot them
general 2020-10-08 04:59:57 No take it out on a panther and just push him so that he cannot shoot you
general 2020-10-08 05:00:01 I literally did that
general 2020-10-08 05:00:19 okay I wish OBS studio would actually record videos
general 2020-10-08 05:03:15 It always has issues with encoding overloads, but one match I was facing a Panther so close that I could see the individual dust particles on his tank. I could not do anything, and he could easily pen me as close as we was. My big brain decided to do this... push him. I nearly pushed him into his spawn all the while as we shoot each other. Could not get through his mantlet, he kept bouncing off my roof. Eventually a jagdtiger killed me after getting bored of watching it. I had fun doing that, and legit 2 enemies and 2 teammates sat there and watching us wrestle.
general 2020-10-08 05:03:25 Bruh I had fun that match
general 2020-10-08 05:03:36 I also made an M19 frend

general 2020-10-08 05:09:17 oh yeah close range
general 2020-10-08 05:09:42 Well assuming the shell is small enough
general 2020-10-08 05:09:54 > I can pen the panther's manlet right?

If you say you need premium time or premium vehicles to get SL, then you either have horrible luck, or you are playing vehicles incorrectly.

general 2020-10-21 22:38:01 also survived a lot of hits and landed
general 2020-10-21 22:38:50 Probably would have had it if I had premium
general 2020-10-21 22:40:03 A lot of times I dont use range finder
general 2020-10-21 22:40:07 I have gotten good at using it
general 2020-10-21 22:40:18 also cupolas on tigers and panthers are shot magnets
general 2020-10-21 22:40:32 and I hit them a lot practically destroying the turret
general 2020-10-21 22:40:37 and everyone inside
general 2020-10-21 22:42:04 But at those brs dont you end up against ATGMs and APDS?
general 2020-10-21 22:42:26 So not like that weakness makes a big difference since now you can get penned frontally
general 2020-10-21 22:43:08 Yeah and 6.3 often gets uptiered from what I hear
general 2020-10-21 22:43:18 seeing as all tiers often get uptiered except top tier
general 2020-10-21 22:43:23 10.7
general 2020-10-21 22:43:26 or 10.3
general 2020-10-21 22:43:51 Full downtier

general 2020-10-21 22:44:17 He must have gotten dragged in by his friends
general 2020-10-21 22:44:19 or his lineup
general 2020-10-21 22:44:55 I know earlier today I snuck above a Pz IV and shot his cupola
general 2020-10-21 22:44:59 did not kill him
general 2020-10-21 22:45:06 but he could defend himself
general 2020-10-21 22:45:11 and I literally jumped on him
general 2020-10-21 22:45:16 so not like he could do anything
general 2020-10-21 22:45:31 plus i had 2 teammates that had just cleaned up a Kv 220
general 2020-10-21 22:45:59 Yes

general 2020-10-23 20:44:46 There was also a Russian ship passed to developers
general 2020-10-23 20:44:52 A pre-dreadnought
general 2020-10-23 20:44:58 So like
general 2020-10-23 20:45:07 Yeah battleships are going to be thing
general 2020-10-23 20:45:22 Gaijin has been repeatedly saying that this update would be the largest yet
general 2020-10-23 20:45:49 So yeah
general 2020-10-23 20:45:55 This is the shopping list
general 2020-10-23 20:47:48 -Dreadnoughts
-Battlecruisers
-Possibly battleships
-Modern aircraft carriers
-Super modern vehicles (anything post cold war, which is not existent in War Thunder)
-Ship horns possibly
-New particle effects
-Nuclear devices
-Possibly top tier bombers (this is just speculation based on nukes)
general 2020-10-23 20:48:03 > largest update and i can't use any of the new stuff because the game is too grindy without paying <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
<@!246412229400985602> No
general 2020-10-23 20:48:16 It really is not hard to grind
general 2020-10-23 20:48:36 It only gets hard when you focus on the grind
general 2020-10-23 20:49:16 Its like how my coach described cross country: It is as much physical, as mental. You need the strength, but also the will to win.

general 2020-10-23 20:50:30 You go to the doctor
general 2020-10-23 20:50:52 They should
general 2020-10-23 20:51:01 Doctors have a ton of tools
general 2020-10-23 20:51:09 even if they do not have splints
general 2020-10-23 20:51:20 it is likely because there is some better way to do it
general 2020-10-23 20:51:48 You get a big boot if you break anything from your ankle down anyways
general 2020-10-23 20:52:54 Oh yes
general 2020-10-23 20:53:07 Also Gaijin is likely updating the current game engine
general 2020-10-23 20:53:16 which is a given
general 2020-10-23 20:54:15 Also with the nuke, there will have to be a bomber dedicated gamemode
general 2020-10-23 20:54:38 Like air RB but instead of player fighters, it would likely be AI flown
general 2020-10-23 20:54:47 Which is just a quess
general 2020-10-23 20:55:17 > it was just part of the trailer
<@456226577798135808> No company would be dumb enough to promise something like that, and not come through
general 2020-10-23 20:55:33 and Gaijin is very unlikely to lie about that
general 2020-10-23 20:56:16 They did not promise battleships or dreadnoughts
general 2020-10-23 20:56:23 yet those are being added
general 2020-10-23 20:58:08 > should I get war thunder?
<@!725583147928125461> Depends
general 2020-10-23 20:59:14 How much patience you have? Are you willing to learn? Do you have good reactions? Do you have fun from figuring out new things, being strategic and using your brains, or by success?

general 2020-10-23 21:02:48 > RB air sucks ass
<@!389756407483990028> yeah, but sometimes it does not. It also brings in absolutely absurd amounts of SL and RP
general 2020-10-23 21:03:21 War Thunder also be getting the Red Eyes of doom

general 2020-10-23 21:11:27 Updating the war thunder shopping list as I find new information
general 2020-10-23 21:15:15 War Thunder major update "New Power" shopping list. Based on confirmed, and possible ideas.

-Dreadnoughts
-Battlecruisers
-Possibly battleships (or at least in the future)
-Modern aircraft carriers
-Super modern vehicles (anything post cold war, which is not existent in War Thunder)
-Ship horns possibly
-New explosion effects
-New gun fire effects
-New clouds
-New maps
-**Possibly** new hangers based on the existence of people in some locations of the teaser
-Nuclear devices
-Possibly top tier bombers (this is just speculation based on nukes)
-Bomber based gamemode based nuclear devices being added

general 2020-10-23 21:15:48 Video of what might be being added
general 2020-10-23 21:16:20 Now this might be coming by December or late November
general 2020-10-23 21:18:02 > they might add the b-52
<@!555601119473041409> Unlikely. That aircraft would be several times bigger then the B-29, which few, if not any defenses to speak of. If they added the B-52 it would likely be if the speculation of a bomber only gamemode was added
general 2020-10-23 21:18:52 I just enabled my headphones and heard someone being murdered, and someone dying of natural causes
general 2020-10-23 21:20:11 Stealth technology
general 2020-10-23 21:20:57 > stealth technology in WT would be too OP
<@!484529511468236802> It exists, it is called an airspawn with the sun behind your back

general 2020-10-23 22:31:04 I just used the default
general 2020-10-23 22:31:45 Bec===========
general 2020-10-23 22:36:25 That thing where the missile is coming out of the silo sounds suspiciously like my cat walking down the stairs
general 2020-10-23 22:37:10 Anything can be a missile
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:55:45 I cannot even hear it
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:55:49 I cannot hear anything
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:55:56 I am deaf
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:10 I dunno how too
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:12 I think
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:14 I am loosing my sense
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:18 and memory
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:21 oh no
bot-central 2020-10-23 22:56:22 help
general 2020-10-24 16:32:01 Ya know the War Thunder update teaser
general 2020-10-24 16:32:19 Well supposedly it was all pure ingame footage
general 2020-10-24 16:32:38 meaning the ships, new tanks, effects, and the nuclear explosion are real
general 2020-10-24 16:33:18 Obviously nukes would not be allowed in ground RB
general 2020-10-24 16:34:41 I might need to look further into this, but the ships at the beginning of the teaser in the fog are some of the earliest battleships built
general 2020-10-24 16:35:16 So this could mean that expansion of naval having battlecruisers, dreadnoughts, and battleships
general 2020-10-24 16:35:28 > <@!505835349889777685> actually no there is a uss battleship in that
<@456226577798135808> I know there is none
general 2020-10-24 16:35:39 but the other nations are in there
general 2020-10-24 16:35:44 except the US
general 2020-10-24 16:36:17 No I dont think there are any
general 2020-10-24 16:36:35 It could be British or American
general 2020-10-24 16:36:49 as it resembled a design from both nations
general 2020-10-24 16:37:00 I think it resembles the HMS dreadnought
general 2020-10-24 16:37:09 but I would like to see the photo
general 2020-10-24 16:38:17 I also saw his vid on it, and it does look like the Dreadnought as well as a american ship
general 2020-10-24 16:38:22 So it really could be either
general 2020-10-24 16:38:58 OBC
general 2020-10-24 16:39:28 yes
general 2020-10-24 16:40:21 obc but as a furry

<@!403843930543882241> If the island was made of parts instead of terrain then yes. Otherwise it cannot happen.
general 2020-10-24 20:20:49 The game just crashed, then it opened up and went to this screen, then crashed again. In the span of 10 seconds

general 2020-10-24 22:30:43 **Germany has too many aircraft with similar names and designations**

general 2020-10-24 22:33:56 Germany just really like improving their current aircraft a lot
general 2020-10-24 22:34:37 > why u unlock so many tier 3 planes

general 2020-10-24 22:39:04 Remember stock
general 2020-10-24 22:39:59 Also the climb rate I think is average at the ideal speed from sea level to the flight ceiling
general 2020-10-24 22:40:57 So the Ta 152 can out climb you, but at altitudes it may drop off as the engine is not getting enough air, and the lack of air over the wings

the-dump 2020-10-25 15:54:54 Gaijin map design does belong in <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-10-25 16:00:16 I would say that no balancing is needed, but seeing as how dumb some teams can be, especially with American planes, maybe it would be a good idea
general 2020-10-25 16:00:41 Me and 2 others are alive

general 2020-10-26 16:37:40 There is no best tank. Only the one best for you. Someone could be really good at heavy tanks, and bad at lights, while you could be amazing at lights and bad at heavies. Or you could blow away enemy teams M56 with its literally no armor

general 2020-10-26 16:40:29 it can be very fun, and it is really pretty
general 2020-10-26 16:40:36 also the soundtrack is fire
general 2020-10-26 16:40:54 I dont complain about RNG, I just am not a fan of it

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 20:30:38 In War Thunder to get a dedicated tech tree you need tanks, helicopters, aircraft, and ships. You need enough to make a full tech tree of at least 3 vehicles per rank

general 2020-10-28 14:06:04 I think it is underrated
general 2020-10-28 14:06:11 especially the developers
general 2020-10-28 14:06:27 tbh they are a whole lot better then most development teams
general 2020-10-28 14:07:06 > if it wasn't so p2w and made you waste months of your life to grind
<@!623250983908278272> WT or WoT?
general 2020-10-28 14:07:39 okay okay okay
general 2020-10-28 14:09:15 **PSA: The definition of pay to win (p2w) is a bought service, or item, that is required to progress to a finished state. War Thunder, has no such system that requires you to buy your way to top tier for any nation. You can literally grind out every single tech tree vehicle**
general 2020-10-28 14:09:33 That is not paying to win
general 2020-10-28 14:09:38 I have hardly ever used that
general 2020-10-28 14:10:28 > or that premium vehicles are significantly better than normal ones and they put you in lobbies with lower tiered players
<@!317833859603496971> Your points do not explain how War Thunder is pay to win
general 2020-10-28 14:10:41 War Thunder
general 2020-10-28 14:10:42 is not
general 2020-10-28 14:10:44 pay to win
general 2020-10-28 14:10:47 period
general 2020-10-28 14:11:02 You do not have to buy your way to any top tier vehicle
general 2020-10-28 14:11:07 So it is not pay to win
general 2020-10-28 14:12:38 Crossout is not made by Gaijin <@!317833859603496971>
general 2020-10-28 14:12:46 It is published by Gaijin
general 2020-10-28 14:12:54 but not made by Gaijin
general 2020-10-28 14:13:42 I have played for half a year
general 2020-10-28 14:13:46 bought nothing
general 2020-10-28 14:14:22 > the only p2w aspect it has is bushes
<@!221487880487436288> That would be the closest to pay to win in War Thunder, but you can always use other bushes
general 2020-10-28 14:14:28 Or other objects
general 2020-10-28 14:15:59 > the fact that gaijin shoves $60 deals down your throat every time you log in
<@!317833859603496971> They dont
general 2020-10-28 14:16:50 > oh or the fact you can literally skip the entire tech tree to get a tank or plane or ship thats better than every other one in its class
<@!317833859603496971> That is not Pay to Win
general 2020-10-28 14:17:40 <@!317833859603496971> Define pay to win for me
general 2020-10-28 14:21:24 I bet he is just hates the game but is too stubborn to quit so he is just going to complain
general 2020-10-28 14:21:38 > WT isnt p2w its just incredibly hard to grind
<@!673397945764151336> Not hard, just really tedious
general 2020-10-28 14:26:50 AA
general 2020-10-28 14:27:02 I play tanks, planes, and ships
general 2020-10-28 14:28:14 > yo what
<@!623250983908278272> imagine screenshot
general 2020-10-28 14:29:17 > <@!505835349889777685> can you teach me how to play naval
<@!389756407483990028> Small ships at AB, large for RB. Really in low tier AB it is just brain dead shooting, but not to say it cannot be fun.
general 2020-10-28 14:29:29 Naval is pretty tricky though
general 2020-10-28 14:29:44 aiming is quite difficult as you have to account for a lot
general 2020-10-28 14:30:14 your ships speed, the enemies speed, the direction you are going, the direction they are going, distance, as well as ship parts
general 2020-10-28 14:30:37 Armor is not much to worry about at low tiers
general 2020-10-28 14:30:41 so mainly just shoot
general 2020-10-28 14:30:47 Hit B by default
general 2020-10-28 14:31:01 And it will stop the ship as fast as possible
general 2020-10-28 14:32:24 <@!437078588701933568> I have gotten two of them
general 2020-10-28 14:33:34 You can sometimes get up to 12 kills in one ship
general 2020-10-28 14:33:43 I did that once
general 2020-10-28 14:34:00 I charged right through the enemy team and started picking them off one by one
general 2020-10-28 14:34:13 they got so shocked that they could not figure out what to do
general 2020-10-28 14:34:34 plus there were so many of them in one spot they could not get to me very effectively
general 2020-10-28 14:35:32 <@!437078588701933568> No
general 2020-10-28 14:35:35 but it is mean
general 2020-10-28 14:37:09 <@!389756407483990028> Arcade Battles
general 2020-10-28 14:37:12 also low tier
general 2020-10-28 14:37:23 once you start getting better vehicles it gets easier
general 2020-10-28 14:37:44 also in naval you can get absolutely impressive amounts of kills
general 2020-10-28 14:39:41 yeah it sucks
general 2020-10-28 14:39:55 **but haha I got through tier II so I dont have to anymore**
general 2020-10-28 14:40:10 Grind
general 2020-10-28 14:40:11 a lot
general 2020-10-28 14:40:15 or play Italy
general 2020-10-28 14:40:22 and only Italy
general 2020-10-28 14:40:40 because tier II italy is not a war crime
general 2020-10-28 14:41:23 The server became official
general 2020-10-28 14:42:10 Ye
general 2020-10-28 14:42:20 Chonk ships
general 2020-10-28 14:43:06 The tech tree is going to have to be redone for the introduction of dreadnoughts, battleships, battlecruisers, and more modern ships
general 2020-10-28 14:43:35 The only BR range left would be pushing against jets
general 2020-10-28 14:43:48 For dreadnoughts which are being added the next update
general 2020-10-28 14:44:08 The tech tree works now, but as more stuff is added it will get more crowded
general 2020-10-28 14:44:11 and compressed

general 2020-10-28 16:39:06 > Dumb politics entertains me
<@!451025784228806656> It is all hilarious until you learn that these people either want power, or are already in power
general 2020-10-28 16:39:35 and being from a religious family makes it a gazillion times worse
general 2020-10-28 16:42:25 If a certain group gets more power, and the rest stay in power, then based on the Bible (all versions) then a one world dictatorship will come to power, and eventually torture and kill everyone
general 2020-10-28 16:42:55 And the interesting thing is that some people actually worship these people
general 2020-10-28 16:43:05 like actual full blown worship
general 2020-10-28 16:43:24 Yes but this would 7.8 billion people

general 2020-10-30 15:14:42 why are there are many obcs
general 2020-10-30 15:21:25 How big is the War Thunder update going to be
general 2020-10-30 15:21:26 like
general 2020-10-30 15:21:38 I am scared to see how long it will take to update it
general 2020-10-30 15:22:34 New hangers, new game engine, probably the second largest vehicle update, I assume new sounds
general 2020-10-30 15:22:52 Naval tech tree rework
general 2020-10-30 15:23:16 Which is going to be really nice, but rather interesting
general 2020-10-30 15:23:34 now that top tiers will be fighting PT boats
general 2020-10-30 15:24:07 Which sounds like they have no chance, but most large ships only have secondary and AA armaments target aircraft only
general 2020-10-30 15:24:16 and PT boats are incredibly small and nimble
general 2020-10-30 15:24:27 too
general 2020-10-30 15:24:28 many
general 2020-10-30 15:24:29 obc

general 2020-10-30 15:26:20 Game physics
general 2020-10-30 15:27:06 1-6 should not be playing
general 2020-10-30 15:27:28 ideally 10-18 would be, and is the recommended range
general 2020-10-30 15:28:03 ROblox was originally designed to appeal to those between 8-18
general 2020-10-30 15:28:13 however the player base had a different approach
general 2020-10-30 15:28:27 excuse me
general 2020-10-30 15:29:09 the player range be 6-500 basically
general 2020-10-30 15:29:22 > WT servers are down
<@!335599526414909451> I wonder why
general 2020-10-30 15:29:31 the player load seems a little normal
general 2020-10-30 15:29:39 the upper range of normal
general 2020-10-30 15:29:42 but still normal
general 2020-10-30 15:30:19 When quarantine was in place the game beat the record for most players online at once
general 2020-10-30 15:30:30 and yet the servers showed no sign of slowing
general 2020-10-30 15:30:55 dont see no discounts
general 2020-10-30 15:31:25 Oh now I do
general 2020-10-30 15:32:26 I guess it must be battle activity and using boosters and what not
general 2020-10-30 15:32:44 But there are only 67k online right now
general 2020-10-30 15:33:18 Wargame
general 2020-10-30 15:34:00 Hopefully the servers issues do not persist through the update
general 2020-10-30 15:34:02 that would suck
general 2020-10-30 15:34:06 like a lot

general 2020-11-02 00:02:10 Its max speed is mediocre for first generation jets
general 2020-11-02 00:02:18 the jets that barely worked
general 2020-11-02 00:02:34 some props can outspeed it in the right conditions
general 2020-11-02 00:03:07 In the past it might have been good for carriers
general 2020-11-02 00:03:17 but modern carriers are being added with it
general 2020-11-02 00:03:38 so it looses that potential
general 2020-11-02 00:03:47 I guess maybe it can land at heli bases
general 2020-11-02 00:03:58 but it is not going to last very long in ground battles
general 2020-11-02 00:04:11 and it is too slow in air battles
general 2020-11-02 00:04:19 for the armament it has
general 2020-11-02 00:04:57 In my opinion it should not be added as there is no way that I can think of to balance it
general 2020-11-02 00:05:44 7.0 speed with 9.0+ armament
general 2020-11-02 00:05:56 9.0-10.0 weapons

general 2020-11-02 16:12:38 Bedrock is rather nice
general 2020-11-02 16:12:46 So you did not loose much
general 2020-11-02 16:13:13 The only thing you loose with bedrock is full modding capabilities
general 2020-11-02 16:14:32 You also loose this with bedrock
general 2020-11-02 16:14:59 Oh btw Windows 10 is literally just PC Bedrock
general 2020-11-02 16:16:40 It is cross platform

general 2020-11-02 20:11:38 > in the plane that won the war
<@!265819387498332160> The Spitfire?
general 2020-11-02 20:12:47 oh
general 2020-11-02 20:12:49 the mustang
general 2020-11-02 20:13:14 **The RAF clapped the Luftwaffe with their Spitfires though**
general 2020-11-02 20:13:25 They lost practically their entire airforce
general 2020-11-02 20:13:43 The Mustang would likely have won the war
general 2020-11-02 20:13:49 but the British were faster
general 2020-11-02 20:14:37 and well against the Japanese were Corsairs, Lightnings, and [insert naval aircraft]
general 2020-11-02 20:15:00 <@!389756407483990028> Through the roof
general 2020-11-02 20:15:20 > <@!505835349889777685> tanks will be moving

general 2020-11-02 20:15:26 like dogfighting but easier
general 2020-11-02 20:17:07 > the mustang prolly didnt exist until 43 or 44
<@!389756407483990028> 42
general 2020-11-02 20:17:28 > the mustang won the war, i think it can fight a single jet
<@!265819387498332160> Literally any aircraft with a gun can
general 2020-11-02 20:17:38 Yes
general 2020-11-02 20:17:40 and win
general 2020-11-02 20:17:43 it is possible
general 2020-11-02 20:17:59 Btw what are your dad's sources
general 2020-11-02 20:18:40 The mustang certainly contributed to the war
general 2020-11-02 20:18:48 and it certainly could have won
general 2020-11-02 20:18:51 but again
general 2020-11-02 20:19:11 the British RAF defeated most the german air forces in one single battle
general 2020-11-02 20:19:21 and something the germans could not recover from
general 2020-11-02 20:19:38 Not with the constant bombings from British Lancasters and American Flying Fortresses
general 2020-11-02 20:19:53 > but did a spitfire destroy a german destroyer like the mustang did
<@!265819387498332160> Red tails
general 2020-11-02 20:19:54 smh
general 2020-11-02 20:20:05 It is not that easy to take down a destroyer
general 2020-11-02 20:20:36 Plus I dont recall that fighter even aiming at the ammo of the destroyer
general 2020-11-02 20:20:45 but rather below the superstructure and up
general 2020-11-02 20:21:43 Because of a movie
general 2020-11-02 20:22:07 But what Mustang variant?
general 2020-11-02 20:22:15 there were a lot
general 2020-11-02 20:22:32 No because you used unreliable sources
general 2020-11-02 20:23:14 Also you did not waste my time because you distracted me from homework
general 2020-11-02 20:26:06 Cracked MC?

general 2020-11-02 22:24:43 > I have mixed feelings about Plane Crazy being popular
<@!289930922655088640> I do too
general 2020-11-02 22:25:10 Popularity is good, but the player base is rather... less then ideal
general 2020-11-02 22:25:23 Yeah
general 2020-11-02 22:25:24 why
general 2020-11-02 22:26:08 > Like for example, why make a fuss about my username?
<@!289930922655088640> Do not be surprised if someone tries to hang you from a light pole for existing
general 2020-11-02 22:26:24 that is the literal state of the US right now
general 2020-11-02 22:26:28 it is rather sad

general 2020-11-02 22:27:06 > Well, good thing I'm not in the US
<@!289930922655088640> A lot of the people that cause the problem, left their areas because of the problems they caused.

general 2020-11-02 22:28:00 I am not of voting age
general 2020-11-02 22:28:17 but that basically sums it up
general 2020-11-02 22:28:46 In all honesty though
general 2020-11-02 22:29:39 If you look at actual live, unedited footage and audio, you may want to become a citizen just to vote for the other guy.
general 2020-11-02 22:29:46 Not going to name who would be the issue in this case though
general 2020-11-02 22:29:51 else I will get slapped
general 2020-11-02 22:30:16 not going to get hof

general 2020-11-02 22:35:04 > help paint
<@!429826358827417601> No
general 2020-11-02 22:35:13 I got a flu shot in my dominant arm
general 2020-11-02 22:35:18 so it do be kinda broken
general 2020-11-02 22:35:46 > vErY fUn tO pAiNt
<@!429826358827417601> **HAVE FUN OR I TORTURE**
general 2020-11-02 22:35:58 dead
general 2020-11-02 22:36:16 You can test positive for Covid if you have the flu shot
general 2020-11-02 22:36:41 you can also test positive if you have basically any lung sickness
general 2020-11-02 22:36:46 from the common cold and up
general 2020-11-02 22:37:03 If you get the flu shot
general 2020-11-02 22:37:06 dont get sick
general 2020-11-02 22:37:15 for at least a week
general 2020-11-02 22:37:33 > i'm always slightly sick
<@!296280922771292170> I used to always feel sick
general 2020-11-02 22:37:40 but then I figured out how to be happy
general 2020-11-02 22:37:43 and then I feel good
general 2020-11-02 22:37:48 stress
general 2020-11-02 22:37:58 can be incredibly awful
general 2020-11-02 22:38:19 Stress is basically mental radiation
general 2020-11-02 22:38:37 It can do the same things
general 2020-11-02 22:38:42 except warp DNA
general 2020-11-02 22:38:45 it cannot do that
general 2020-11-02 22:39:01 It could be dehydration
general 2020-11-02 22:39:14 malnutrition
general 2020-11-02 22:39:24 vitamin deficiency
general 2020-11-02 22:39:27 lack of energy
general 2020-11-02 22:39:30 lack of sleep
general 2020-11-02 22:39:42 lack of exercise
general 2020-11-02 22:39:51 could be your environment
general 2020-11-02 22:40:07 I know if you have low blood pressure, at high altitudes you body basically dies
general 2020-11-02 22:40:54 Too much water can really hurt your body
general 2020-11-02 22:41:47 The human body is frustratingly fragile
general 2020-11-02 22:41:52 but also really durable
general 2020-11-02 22:42:08 its like a B-17
general 2020-11-02 22:42:14 it can take a lot of hits
general 2020-11-02 22:42:17 but it sucks
general 2020-11-02 22:42:23 when damaged
general 2020-11-02 22:43:16 > i am the xf-85 goblin
<@456226577798135808> oh no
general 2020-11-02 22:44:13 > no clue why
<@!296280922771292170> Here is an answer. Doctors like to mess up your body, or purposely not fully treat you so you have to keep coming back, thus you pay more.
general 2020-11-02 22:45:21 Medical centers, insurance companies, and medical suppliers are twisted beyond the imagination of the human mind
general 2020-11-02 22:45:33 What is the test even supposed to look for
general 2020-11-02 22:46:04 Bladder?
general 2020-11-02 22:46:11 Ahh yes
general 2020-11-02 22:46:33 Yeah I would imagine you would need to drink a lot of water
general 2020-11-02 22:47:04 What is the test called?
general 2020-11-02 22:48:14 Either you are giving me the wrong test or you are about to have fun
general 2020-11-02 22:48:47 That is what I got from googling a USG test
general 2020-11-02 22:49:55 Air RB is rather toxic
general 2020-11-02 22:50:02 that makes more sense
general 2020-11-02 22:51:18 **If you looked at the context wrong that would look like Kip is pregnant at 12. Which is not good**
general 2020-11-02 22:51:33 Especially since Kip is known to be a boy
general 2020-11-02 22:51:37 not a girl
general 2020-11-02 22:51:40 which would be worse
general 2020-11-02 22:52:49 
general 2020-11-02 22:52:54 Kip drink a lot of water
general 2020-11-02 22:53:02 but not so much as it hurts you
general 2020-11-02 22:53:53 I guess drink 1-2 liters an hour before the test
general 2020-11-02 22:54:07 since 2 liters is how much water you should be drinking in a day
general 2020-11-02 22:54:12 at least for me
general 2020-11-02 22:55:35 Kip take your weight and divide by half
general 2020-11-02 22:55:42 and that should be how much water you drink a day
general 2020-11-02 22:56:15 no
general 2020-11-02 22:56:23 but it is the best I have
general 2020-11-02 22:57:09 And my mom told me that was it, and seeing she has to take as much care of her body as possible, just so she does not die early, would likely mean it is true
general 2020-11-02 22:57:13 and well
general 2020-11-02 22:57:30 it would be a painful, and horrendously slow death
general 2020-11-02 22:57:31 maybe
general 2020-11-02 22:57:38 most likely
general 2020-11-02 22:58:20 But then if a rocket hits the engine
general 2020-11-02 22:58:27 that entire block is gone
general 2020-11-02 22:59:20 Also <@!409676438682206218> werent you looking for anchovy pfp
general 2020-11-02 22:59:22 or who was it
general 2020-11-02 22:59:26 it was one of the weebs
general 2020-11-02 22:59:50 I dunno but someone needs to set this as their pfp until december
general 2020-11-02 23:00:18 > should i get new anchovy pfp x4
<@!287779983445721088> now yes do it
general 2020-11-02 23:01:40 👀 👀 <:EYES:525319504721608705> 👀
general 2020-11-02 23:02:25 Hmm yes hello
general 2020-11-02 23:02:30 this is the poobusters
general 2020-11-02 23:03:29 I has received a request to ***powerfully*** remove the poo
general 2020-11-02 23:03:53 The sun is setting in such a way I thought the neighbors house was on fire
general 2020-11-02 23:03:59 which would not surprise me
general 2020-11-02 23:04:22 in fact i am surprised our neighbors have not burned down their house in the past year
general 2020-11-02 23:04:42 or anyone elses house
general 2020-11-02 23:04:47 or a car
general 2020-11-02 23:04:58 > stupid wifi
<@!389756407483990028> agreed
general 2020-11-02 23:05:46 > meanwhile my neighbors burn a city's worth of plastic
<@!296280922771292170> Meanwhile in our neighboring state, houses, shops, and cars are literally being burned down
general 2020-11-02 23:06:01 and government buildings
general 2020-11-02 23:06:05 and clinics
general 2020-11-02 23:06:19 and protesters
general 2020-11-02 23:06:26 and probably the actual protesters
general 2020-11-02 23:06:45 > **Protesters?**
<@!389756407483990028> sorry
general 2020-11-02 23:06:55 **Rioters**
general 2020-11-02 23:07:11 I would use a more precise term but I would be clapped
general 2020-11-02 23:08:21 Rather political name
general 2020-11-02 23:08:25 and about 4 years late
general 2020-11-02 23:08:26 but okay
general 2020-11-02 23:09:20 <@456226577798135808> Might want to change that cause the rules are rather restricting
general 2020-11-02 23:09:24 and someone might hurt you
general 2020-11-02 23:09:26 like a lot

<@!296280922771292170> i guess
general 2020-11-02 23:10:48 Roblox is more controlling then Voxel's rules
general 2020-11-02 23:10:54 so if it can pass there
general 2020-11-02 23:11:36 > man the world is such a shitty place ONLY because us humans are behavily like shit
<@!296280922771292170> understatement but yeah

and probably to sell it to other companies
general 2020-11-02 23:14:32 American companies are good at taking your information, and selling it to every other company
general 2020-11-02 23:14:54 > why
<@!389756407483990028> Money
general 2020-11-02 23:15:02 If something does not make sense
general 2020-11-02 23:15:08 and is really bad yet gets passed
general 2020-11-02 23:15:28 the answer is almost always it makes the politicians richer
general 2020-11-02 23:16:18 > america needs to stop focusing on money
<@!389756407483990028> No. Politicians just need to get in trouble for what they do that is wrong
general 2020-11-02 23:16:21 such as corruption
general 2020-11-02 23:17:03 > if you want to make the world a better place then teach people to be better when they're still young
<@!296280922771292170> And teach their parents too
general 2020-11-02 23:17:11 You can teach a kid anything
general 2020-11-02 23:17:25 but they will almost always take after their parents
general 2020-11-02 23:18:49 Our military has an unhealthy addiction to HVAR rockets
general 2020-11-02 23:19:29 And .50 cals
general 2020-11-02 23:37:55 Okay
general 2020-11-02 23:37:56 so
general 2020-11-02 23:38:08 first match in the F8F
general 2020-11-02 23:38:28 it only has one fuel tank
general 2020-11-02 23:38:30 which is good
general 2020-11-02 23:38:43 but it means that if it gets sniped
general 2020-11-02 23:38:47 you will loose all your fuel
general 2020-11-02 23:39:03 a 109 hit my fuel, it caught fire, and burned out instantly
general 2020-11-02 23:40:11 > <@!505835349889777685> now you must choose between two lives or potent to rng
<@!296280922771292170> It seems rather nimble for how chunky it seems
general 2020-11-02 23:40:21 And it is fast on the deck
general 2020-11-02 23:40:28 about as fast as a 109
general 2020-11-02 23:40:47 Not much RNG
general 2020-11-02 23:40:55 It is not in the wings which is good
general 2020-11-02 23:43:31 I just bought 180 days of premium

general 2020-11-02 23:44:48 > why do parents obsess over grades
<@!389756407483990028> Cause they get thousands of dollars off of your collage
general 2020-11-02 23:44:52 also you can get a good job
general 2020-11-02 23:45:11 RI?

HoF
general 2020-11-02 23:51:48 So far that seems un true but I have only 2 matches in it
general 2020-11-02 23:53:58 Found that out already
general 2020-11-02 23:55:14 This thing is supposed to have 29m/s of climb rate when spaded
general 2020-11-02 23:55:18 but stock is 17m/s
general 2020-11-02 23:55:24 I dont buy that
general 2020-11-02 23:56:20 > Cooking scallops and kelbasa for myself *and* <@!505835349889777685>
<@!432344306427101184>
general 2020-11-03 14:08:30 Does anyone else have feelings in their dreams, such as touch, and smell, and pain?
general 2020-11-03 14:08:55 > lucid dream
<@!715019067773157406> I mean outside of lucid dreaming
general 2020-11-03 14:09:00 like a normal dream
general 2020-11-03 14:09:07 where your brain does all the work
general 2020-11-03 14:10:18 I can remember most of my dreams
general 2020-11-03 14:10:24 But like
general 2020-11-03 14:10:44 it is practically a perfect simulation of the environment I live in
general 2020-11-03 14:11:01 my brain can recreate everything
general 2020-11-03 14:11:05 including pain
general 2020-11-03 14:11:08 and injuries
general 2020-11-03 14:11:12 to myself
general 2020-11-03 14:11:25 which is rather cool but it actually hurts
general 2020-11-03 14:14:38 I had a dream today, where there was this massive, powerful storm 5 times as powerful as Hurricane Katrina. The storm was weaker up where I live, but powerful enough to at least land a tornado on the ridge, which is very rare, but that is not what was the issue. I was sleeping through the storm, when lightning hit one of the black walnut trees sitting only feet from our house. Of course it was extremely loud, well it hit again. My brain was so nice and actually decided to recreate the pain the sound would have experienced, as well as the pressure wave from the lighting shaking the house.
general 2020-11-03 14:14:52 It actually damaged my hearing in the dream
general 2020-11-03 14:14:59 and well now that I wake up
general 2020-11-03 14:15:06 my brain feels squish
general 2020-11-03 14:15:40 My dreams are so vivid I often confuse them with reality
general 2020-11-03 14:16:10 even if it is in some fantasy world with glowing flowers and dragons or something
general 2020-11-03 14:16:19 which I sometimes have those dreams
general 2020-11-03 14:16:30 and that morning i was depressed because i have to live in this world
general 2020-11-03 14:17:20 My brain also seems to be able to predict some events
general 2020-11-03 14:17:28 Like something will happen in a dream
general 2020-11-03 14:17:32 and a day to a year later
general 2020-11-03 14:17:34 it may happen
general 2020-11-03 14:18:03 and I feel the craziest sense of deja vu when that happens
general 2020-11-03 14:18:17 > You wouldnt trow yourself into a clif
<@456226577798135808> until you have figured out lucid dreaming
general 2020-11-03 14:18:25 then you can do basically anything
general 2020-11-03 14:18:38 and basically anything means literally anything
general 2020-11-03 14:19:00 > ok die in your dream
<@!715019067773157406> you can do that, but you may remember it
general 2020-11-03 14:19:20 Death is not recommended since you are in that exact moment
general 2020-11-03 14:19:26 so it will have the same effects
general 2020-11-03 14:20:16 Isnt that falsified
general 2020-11-03 14:20:23 like if you die in a dream you die irl
general 2020-11-03 14:20:47 i know it will really mess up your natural reflexes and memory
general 2020-11-03 14:20:57 cause now your brain will think it cannot die
general 2020-11-03 14:21:13 which would be rather problematic when a truck is running at you
general 2020-11-03 14:21:50 Yes be nice to leg truck
general 2020-11-03 14:22:27 > what about dreaming of a toilet when you need to pee
<@!315262125113081856> you can do that
general 2020-11-03 14:22:33 but i would recommend not
general 2020-11-03 14:22:50 as I figured out in my past that peeing in a dream also leads to the same thing irl
general 2020-11-03 14:22:58 which rather sucks
general 2020-11-03 14:23:16 bait?
general 2020-11-03 14:23:58 Like once that I can remember
general 2020-11-03 14:24:02 when i was 7
general 2020-11-03 14:24:04 or 6
general 2020-11-03 14:24:29 My memory goes back very very far
general 2020-11-03 14:24:38 like
general 2020-11-03 14:24:44 When I was 3 years old far
general 2020-11-03 14:24:59 I cannot control my dream
general 2020-11-03 14:25:11 but maybe my brain will decide to follow the suggestion
general 2020-11-03 14:26:30 > Often more than not i realise that i am still dreaming by this point
<@456226577798135808> You could be dreaming
general 2020-11-03 14:26:36 it is always possible
general 2020-11-03 14:26:55 Sometimes I have dreams if I just rest
general 2020-11-03 14:27:01 like I do not need to be asleep
general 2020-11-03 14:27:08 and I will just have a full on dream
general 2020-11-03 14:27:27 But like i have to be thinking about something before that
general 2020-11-03 14:27:33 like replaying a movie scene
general 2020-11-03 14:28:18 I dreamed about playing a war thunder match on the berlin match once
general 2020-11-03 14:28:27 which was rather interesting
general 2020-11-03 14:28:34 because everyone was playing correctly
general 2020-11-03 14:28:43 which confused the heck out of me
general 2020-11-03 14:28:54 i was like this can only be a dream
general 2020-11-03 14:28:58 and then I realized
general 2020-11-03 14:29:01 it was a dream
general 2020-11-03 14:29:11 > imagine having people that know what they doing on your team
<@!315262125113081856> and on the enemy team
general 2020-11-03 14:31:45 > why does spaa attack tanks
<@!389756407483990028> Cause they can
general 2020-11-03 14:31:49 and it works
general 2020-11-03 14:33:49 Or you can remove AP rounds
general 2020-11-03 14:34:00 but that makes AA defenseless against tanks
general 2020-11-03 14:34:08 leaving them only to take out aircraft
general 2020-11-03 14:34:20 if there are no aircraft they can do nothing but cap points
general 2020-11-03 14:34:35 well they cannot do that if there is an enemy tank
general 2020-11-03 14:35:07 also AA with a high repair cost have that because of their efficiency against aircraft
general 2020-11-03 14:35:27 well if they cannot defend from tanks, they will be destroyed, making a big repair cost
general 2020-11-03 14:35:31 and loss of SL
general 2020-11-03 14:35:40 So yeah
general 2020-11-03 14:35:54 AA really does need to keep its AP rounds
general 2020-11-03 14:36:03 so it can actually survive on the ground
general 2020-11-03 14:36:14 also because bombers
general 2020-11-03 14:36:27 and any armored plane
general 2020-11-03 14:36:50 or if you hold a grudge against the pilot and there is an engine block in the way
general 2020-11-03 14:36:58 AP can pen the engine and kill the pilot
general 2020-11-03 14:37:07 and really mess up the engine
general 2020-11-03 14:39:23 side skirts
general 2020-11-03 14:51:00 Undes trying to not get banned be like
general 2020-11-03 14:51:47 a nuke?
general 2020-11-03 14:58:29 frick a bomb got me
general 2020-11-03 14:58:49 I had clipped off a wing when I hit a 109
general 2020-11-03 14:58:54 and was able to land
general 2020-11-03 14:59:05 but a stupid 288 C had other plans
general 2020-11-03 15:01:57 Oh no a P56 had the same issue it seems
general 2020-11-03 15:02:03 and crashed into a hill
general 2020-11-03 15:02:22 F
general 2020-11-03 15:03:04 Who

general 2020-11-03 15:03:13 What
general 2020-11-03 15:03:30 I think it died sooner
general 2020-11-03 15:03:38 Cause I remember it being popular
general 2020-11-03 15:03:49 when I was in 5th grade
general 2020-11-03 15:03:56 then it just disappeared
general 2020-11-03 15:04:06 What is Ps5
general 2020-11-03 15:04:14 imagine fancy box with computer
general 2020-11-03 15:06:45 oh no he is back
general 2020-11-03 15:07:26 and he is gone
general 2020-11-03 15:07:42 he threw his bombs at the end of the runway

<@!658829907110920192> It is not possible, but it is not likely, especially with how many people are voting trump because of how Biden speaks
general 2020-11-04 15:28:43 I very much doubt this. The views of our state are very Republican. I know we are a swing state, but like, we like people who can speak clearly.

<@456226577798135808> 4 states have not finished counting, 3 of which he will win, but Nevada has the closest numbers, and the most behind counting. So ultimately it will be Nevada that decides who will win
general 2020-11-04 23:20:41 If Biden gets Nevada he lands 270 dead on

general 2020-11-04 23:25:13 I dont think that warn was really justifiable, but okay
general 2020-11-04 23:26:05 **Oh wait that means I have a modlog**

general 2020-11-04 23:26:59 and Solomons
general 2020-11-04 23:27:01 so like
general 2020-11-04 23:27:02 yeah
general 2020-11-04 23:28:02 ***I nearly made it two years without a modlog, and I got warned because someone asked how the elections was going and I answered***
general 2020-11-04 23:28:30 I was literally 1 month off

general 2020-11-04 23:34:42 **oh okay that is going to bother me**
general 2020-11-04 23:41:33 <@!195253906333368320> does that mean any talk involving the united states government, including historical stuff involving other countries, or wars is banned?
general 2020-11-04 23:42:02 Why?
general 2020-11-04 23:42:09 Numbers are not going to hurt anyone
general 2020-11-04 23:46:57 I had no warns prior to this. Absolutely none. I had wished to keep it that way, at least up until December 8th, which would be my second year on the server. It is very frustrating that I had lost that streak to something simple, and not harmful. Not toxicity, not NSFW, or not even a warn from earlier when I had got into an argument over who would be the better president. I got warned, because I answered a question, about the state of the election. Something that would hurt only the most sensitive. It is rather sad that I had gotten warned for something so simple, and because of a rule that I rather hate and don't understand the reasoning behind.
general 2020-11-04 23:49:04 > TLDR
<@!451025784228806656> I don't agree with the reasoning why I got warned. It is very frustrating to get warned over something so simple, when there were worse things that could have gotten me a genuine warn. I had absolutely no warns prior, for almost 2 years.
general 2020-11-04 23:50:02 > what did u get warned for
<@!315262125113081856> I answered a question Solomons had. Asking if anyone won yet, and explained what was left to decide the winner.
general 2020-11-04 23:50:25 i got warned
general 2020-11-04 23:50:32 like of nowhere
general 2020-11-04 23:50:39 Answering the question
general 2020-11-04 23:50:47 that is it
general 2020-11-04 23:50:53 i answered a question
general 2020-11-04 23:50:55 that harmed no one
general 2020-11-04 23:50:59 Rule 2
general 2020-11-04 23:51:29 So any talk about current events will get you warned
general 2020-11-04 23:51:39 I probably could get warned for complaining about why I got warned
general 2020-11-04 23:52:18 I remember Voxel saying that the rules are so strict because people get mad easily
general 2020-11-04 23:52:23 obc warned me
general 2020-11-04 23:52:26 and Solomons
general 2020-11-04 23:52:35 and ShadowDev

<@!673397945764151336> an actually surprising amount of people
general 2020-11-10 15:55:09 I think the SL bonuses are quite high at lower tiers
general 2020-11-10 15:55:25 At lower tiers it can be a struggle
general 2020-11-10 15:55:31 but that is basically ground rb

<@!610795263992528909> because they dont turn well, they need speed, they dont have prop wash, and more speed means more engine power

<@!437078588701933568>
general 2020-11-10 16:03:42 This plane is the most overpowered piece of aerial technology in the whole of War Thunder. It is as fast as a fighter, can turn like one, has a 20mm for defenses, hard to rip, and can put out literally any fire with ease.
general 2020-11-10 16:04:14 the Ju 288 is the bane of every fighter
general 2020-11-10 16:05:58 look at this

general 2020-11-10 16:06:03 in level flight

general 2020-11-10 18:33:28 1000% SL modifier on that plane
general 2020-11-10 18:33:42 900%-1000% SL modifier on that plane
general 2020-11-10 18:33:53 has a high repair cost
general 2020-11-10 18:33:55 but that thing
general 2020-11-10 18:33:59 just playing it
general 2020-11-10 18:34:04 I feel bad for the enemy
general 2020-11-10 18:34:55 the amount of effort needed to put into the F4U-4B just to take it down is painful even for the pilot
general 2020-11-10 18:37:24 But then the pilot knows evasive maneuvers and has a lot of experience fighting Me 264's from the back

general 2020-11-10 20:21:37 Oi
general 2020-11-10 20:21:59 Wings are going to bend in War Thunder when pulling high G maneuvers
general 2020-11-10 20:22:16 Yes
general 2020-11-10 20:22:27 Supposedly
general 2020-11-10 20:22:39 I am watching a dev server stream
general 2020-11-10 20:22:50 and everyone there seems to saying it will
general 2020-11-10 20:23:10 The streamer tested it out, but got almost unnoticeable results
general 2020-11-10 20:23:26 Javelin
general 2020-11-10 20:24:13 He was flying the Pe-8 just to try out the bomb effects, then the B-29 when he was told about it
general 2020-11-10 20:24:32 But you obviously need speed
general 2020-11-10 20:24:45 and that was what kinda missing
general 2020-11-10 20:26:44 They would
general 2020-11-10 20:26:51 but it is Gaijin
general 2020-11-10 20:26:56 they
general 2020-11-10 20:27:02 do random stuff
general 2020-11-10 20:27:21 Adding wing flexing would not be surprising from Gaijin
general 2020-11-10 20:27:29 at least I would not be very surprised
general 2020-11-10 20:29:24 makes sense
general 2020-11-10 20:29:54 Not really realistic but
general 2020-11-10 20:30:00 eh
general 2020-11-10 20:30:34 Russian fighters do have to work to take down a Bf 109, such as Bf 109 towards the Russian
general 2020-11-10 20:30:51 I really do not enjoy health systems
general 2020-11-10 20:31:16 Pilot snipes are not that common
general 2020-11-10 20:31:33 they are less likely then catching on fire
general 2020-11-10 20:32:16 > they aren't common for you, but they are common on the german team
<@!340771008254312450> That cannot be very possible, except for the bombers and heavy fighters with the sort of bubble like front
general 2020-11-10 20:32:44 The Americans have it worse with their Tear-drop canopies
general 2020-11-10 20:33:08 > the americans have the p-47.
<@!340771008254312450> Tear-drop canopy
general 2020-11-10 20:33:16 heavy aircraft
general 2020-11-10 20:33:18 large
general 2020-11-10 20:33:20 easy to hit
general 2020-11-10 20:34:04 The P-47 is one of those aircraft that are extremely powerful when used correctly
general 2020-11-10 20:35:13 > i must be unlucky because i do get outclimbed
<@!340771008254312450> That is not luck
general 2020-11-10 20:35:33 The Bf-109 can outclimb almost all american aircraft at midtiers
general 2020-11-10 20:36:24 If you climb the best you can, at between 250-300 IAS, you will outclimb american fighters
general 2020-11-10 20:36:51 bonus points if you use Manual engine control efficiently
general 2020-11-10 20:37:23 Yeah but we still have the game
general 2020-11-10 20:37:44 If you are climbing at 90 degrees then you are just falling
general 2020-11-10 20:37:58 At 10 degrees you are wasting your potential
general 2020-11-10 20:38:33 Then stop climbing at 10 degrees
general 2020-11-10 20:38:53 The americans can get to almost 2000 in half a minute
general 2020-11-10 20:39:31 You are obviously doing something wrong if you are not at least at the same level as most the american teams
general 2020-11-10 20:39:45 > i don't use angles
<@!340771008254312450> well there is an issue
general 2020-11-10 20:40:17 You **NEED** to know your angle of climb
general 2020-11-10 20:40:27 or just focus on your IAS
general 2020-11-10 20:41:23 If you cannot understand that basic idea then you are likely to fail at life
general 2020-11-10 20:42:00 deat?
general 2020-11-10 20:42:39 > before you tell me how to use my flaps let me ask you a question
<@!340771008254312450> how about you tell us the use of flaps first
general 2020-11-10 20:43:57 Flaps are best used at low speeds
general 2020-11-10 20:45:03 It seems like your trouble with War Thunder is because you do not know how to fly
general 2020-11-10 20:45:06 Please note
general 2020-11-10 20:45:08 there are tanks
general 2020-11-10 20:45:10 and ships
general 2020-11-10 20:45:27 > yeah and i have a tiger
<@!340771008254312450> and?

general 2020-11-10 20:47:28 > and it worked
<@!340771008254312450> and then you found me who just shoots your cupola or turret mantlet
general 2020-11-10 20:47:41 or just bonked your gun barrel

general 2020-11-11 23:21:58 you wont tell me the repair costs
general 2020-11-11 23:23:32 Man is shooting at a mountain because his farm in the valley did not produce a good crop. Like a mountain would have any idea what a farm is

<@456226577798135808> epicer is an impressive overstatement
general 2020-11-12 02:27:17 This community used to be really nice
general 2020-11-12 02:27:20 Now it sucks
general 2020-11-12 02:27:22 becuase
general 2020-11-12 02:27:24 **unde**
general 2020-11-12 02:27:38 Jealous of what?
general 2020-11-12 02:29:11 > <@!505835349889777685> never has been
<@!224513422161739776> It was in 2018 into mid 2019
general 2020-11-12 02:29:17 then it slowly devolved
general 2020-11-12 03:11:25 <#384027830192832513>
general 2020-11-12 03:11:56 Guys <#384027830192832513> before someone gets in trouble
general 2020-11-12 21:20:59 My school just announced we are going completely virtual. They sent an email out to all the teachers and parents before school ended, but straight after sent an email out to the teachers telling them not to tell us. Well one of the band teachers already told his class before seeing that email. So now everyone knows
general 2020-11-12 21:26:54 Man is lying. I just checked the stock repair costs of most of the nations. A stock P-51 H is more expensive then a Spitfire Mk24 or the La9. In fact the only plane that is more expensive is the Ta 152 C-3
general 2020-11-12 21:28:13 Yes the repair is a joke. The normal repair cost being twice as much as all nations normal repair cost.
general 2020-11-12 21:28:38 Also keeps telling me to learn how to play aircraft that he says "are braindead easy to play"
general 2020-11-12 21:28:52 I am surprised he has not tried to continue his argument
general 2020-11-12 21:29:19 I like how he got mad because I said the American prop tree is a more difficult tree
general 2020-11-12 21:29:36 and he got salty because he kept dying to them
general 2020-11-12 21:29:40 **IN JETS**
general 2020-11-12 21:30:11 He tried to argue with my claim of high repair costs
general 2020-11-12 21:30:22 which I complained about
general 2020-11-12 21:30:29 ish
general 2020-11-12 21:30:33 not really complained
general 2020-11-12 21:30:37 I just pointed it
general 2020-11-12 21:31:00 but eventually I started complaining as he kept coming up with different stuff to fight my claim
general 2020-11-12 21:31:44 I like how this started it
general 2020-11-12 21:31:56 me answering this question
general 2020-11-12 21:32:06 the person who asked the question then argued with me
general 2020-11-12 21:32:13 then the other dude joined
general 2020-11-12 21:32:15 and he left
general 2020-11-12 21:32:51 Also the P-51 H has limited WEP that last time I checked
general 2020-11-12 21:33:35 > there is limited wep in rb?
<@!314383347214319616> In some aircraft
general 2020-11-12 21:35:13 Some aircraft, such as those with Rotary engines, have a ADI system. ADI being Anti-Detonant (I dont know how to spell it) Injection
general 2020-11-12 21:35:32 I think the Mustangs just burn the engine for WEP
general 2020-11-12 21:35:47 I dont know how WEP works on Inline engines
general 2020-11-12 21:36:17 > <@!505835349889777685> infinite wep at full radiator
<@!265819387498332160> Counter productive. The radiators create a lot of drag
general 2020-11-12 21:37:04 > <@!505835349889777685> actually it is very minimal in the p-51
<@!265819387498332160> At closed or low setting radiators because of the cooling system below the plane
general 2020-11-12 21:37:15 Because the air is being heated and compressed
general 2020-11-12 21:37:18 like a jet engine
general 2020-11-12 21:37:50 Luckily your ideal climbing for the Mustang keeps the engine cooler
general 2020-11-12 21:38:05 and well fast plane means more air to replace heat in the radiator
general 2020-11-12 21:38:56 I stopped using MEC as I need to improve my general flying skills
general 2020-11-12 21:39:03 And I had no idea what I was doing
general 2020-11-12 21:39:30 I do sometimes use it to extend radiator foils as a sort of airbrake
general 2020-11-12 21:39:47 or I close them in the case of an engine fire
general 2020-11-12 21:39:53 else I wont play with MEC
general 2020-11-12 21:40:16 > p-38 plays too passive, and if you want to play more aggressive, flaps are needed to turn with fighters so it burns so, so much energy
<@!265819387498332160> The P-38 was designed as a bomber interceptor
general 2020-11-12 21:40:30 Yeah
general 2020-11-12 21:40:38 It rips at high speeds
general 2020-11-12 21:40:45 ye
general 2020-11-12 21:41:30 With the P-38 you need to do a 'lead dive' where you dive after the enemy but aim in front of the enemy
general 2020-11-12 21:41:40 a pure dive is pointing straight at the enemy
general 2020-11-12 21:41:45 lag would be behind
general 2020-11-12 21:41:52 aight imma go
general 2020-11-12 21:41:57 birthday
general 2020-11-23 15:16:27 Imma guess drama happened earlier
general 2020-11-23 15:16:38 based on the slowmode
general 2020-11-23 15:17:48 Oil floats on a lot more liquids then just water
general 2020-11-23 15:18:15 Also I have a question
general 2020-11-23 15:18:50 What if it snows instead of rains, or hails, or does anything else but rain
general 2020-11-23 15:20:13 The oil is washing off
general 2020-11-23 15:21:42 F
general 2020-11-23 15:22:13 <:wot:695654208837255219>
general 2020-11-23 15:23:14 Secretly madattak
general 2020-11-23 15:23:41 Why is slowmode even on
general 2020-11-23 15:25:15 why is fonkl assisting the rebellion?
general 2020-11-23 15:25:36 The flag is upside down
general 2020-11-23 15:26:18 No. Use the 20mm Oerlikon autocannons
general 2020-11-23 15:27:24 They were very effective
general 2020-11-23 15:27:51 Holy cow the power line is on fire
general 2020-11-23 15:28:52 Reinstall roblox?
general 2020-11-23 15:29:41 By the looks of reinstalled windows means you reinstalled your operating system
general 2020-11-23 15:29:50 Unless you took out your bedroom window
general 2020-11-23 15:29:54 and put it back in
general 2020-11-23 15:48:58 water
general 2020-11-23 15:53:57 If I had a penny for every time someone shared that fact
general 2020-11-23 15:58:45 that takes time
general 2020-11-23 15:58:53 and most of us are lazy
general 2020-11-23 16:00:55 You should see what is wrong then
general 2020-11-23 16:01:02 A toilet is rather simple
general 2020-11-23 16:06:04 Did rick literally just spam ping

general 2020-11-23 16:13:27 He used thirty days instead of one month
general 2020-11-23 16:14:22 isnt the second ban supposed to be a month?
general 2020-11-23 16:14:30 I feel like it would be a month
general 2020-11-23 16:16:00 What would it be bypassing
general 2020-11-23 16:17:02 I can see half of why that word is filtered
general 2020-11-23 16:17:49 Imma guess that word is filtered for the company with that name
general 2020-11-23 16:17:55 It should be
general 2020-11-23 16:19:03 I find it rather interesting as that word was filtered well after we replaced the thunder in War Thunder in that name as it represents the servers. A fire waiting to happen
general 2020-11-23 16:19:28 okay 30+ modlogs
general 2020-11-23 16:19:59 non minor?
general 2020-11-23 16:20:02 That means major
general 2020-11-23 16:20:52 Okay
general 2020-11-23 16:20:53 but
general 2020-11-23 16:21:04 I have an issue with covering your self in oil to fly in rain
general 2020-11-23 16:21:10 You could so much more
general 2020-11-23 16:21:15 Like cardboard
general 2020-11-23 16:21:24 or packing foam
general 2020-11-23 16:21:30 or cooking oils
general 2020-11-23 16:21:41 not like crude oil
general 2020-11-23 16:22:07 Foam floats better and is less likely to catch fire
general 2020-11-23 16:22:24 I am
general 2020-11-23 16:22:32 Yes that also works
general 2020-11-23 16:22:48 Also oil can wash off
general 2020-11-23 16:22:59 On top of that
general 2020-11-23 16:30:43 I have school today and tomorrow

general 2020-11-23 18:53:53 I called Plane Crazy, Crazy Planes a lot so I am convinced that is what is was called then
general 2020-11-23 18:55:00 no it is crazy plane
general 2020-11-23 18:55:33 > i waste too much time here 😔
<@456226577798135808> same
general 2020-11-23 18:56:03 The same as arcade battles
general 2020-11-23 18:56:46 toxic
general 2020-11-23 18:57:19 did you just experience server lag
general 2020-11-23 18:59:17 why
general 2020-11-23 18:59:52 the gods
general 2020-11-23 19:00:27 english. I cannot figure out what you said
general 2020-11-23 19:01:53 Those who play realistic go to Arcade if they want a challenge. Those who play Arcade go for Realistic if they want a challenge
general 2020-11-23 19:02:33 I have played a lot of both Arcade and Realistic
general 2020-11-23 19:02:47 I find arcade quite challenging though
general 2020-11-23 19:03:08 because you are left with little time to react
general 2020-11-23 19:03:24 not really
general 2020-11-23 19:03:31 the game does most of it for you
general 2020-11-23 19:03:52 You can look for little black dots in the sky that might be aircraft
general 2020-11-23 19:04:01 and you cannot see through clouds anymore
general 2020-11-23 19:04:08 so not like that makes a different
general 2020-11-23 19:06:04 <@!615356321340063784>
general 2020-11-23 19:07:13 toxic
general 2020-11-23 19:07:39 that is cause we need them
general 2020-11-23 19:09:37 yay
general 2020-11-23 19:10:51 too much school
general 2020-11-23 19:10:52 and work
general 2020-11-23 19:11:10 you are a turtle
general 2020-11-23 19:11:15 not a boot
general 2020-11-23 19:11:16 and not a bot
general 2020-11-23 19:11:48 Carl doesnt have a brother
general 2020-11-23 19:12:00 morning
general 2020-11-23 19:12:23 afternoon
general 2020-11-23 19:30:41 🧠
general 2020-11-23 19:50:28 It is not grindy if you have fun, and use good practices to make the grind time a lot less. Such as not focusing on the grind
general 2020-11-23 19:51:14 Yeah I love playing random custom battles to take a break
general 2020-11-23 19:51:24 They have also taught me a few things
general 2020-11-23 19:53:41 WoT has a tier system. Also the tier system in War Thunder is literally just for organization really. It really only has that annoying requirements when it comes to naval. With the lack of ships and boats, you have to get every vehicle of a certain tier. Also 20 years? It does not take very long to get new vehicles if you dont play for the vehicles.
general 2020-11-23 19:54:35 then dont grind the bombers
general 2020-11-23 19:54:45 get the fighters
general 2020-11-23 19:54:58 In what nation?
general 2020-11-23 19:55:08 Cause I have not heard of a dynamic like that
general 2020-11-23 19:55:21 are you bruh
general 2020-11-23 19:55:22 No
general 2020-11-23 19:55:26 no not at all
general 2020-11-23 19:55:54 You literally could grind out every nation with just fighters
general 2020-11-23 19:56:07 maybe a few exceptions where you need a bomber here and there
general 2020-11-23 19:56:54 *Sweden*
general 2020-11-23 19:57:13 Or you could do what some people do and use the bombers as fighters
general 2020-11-23 19:57:30 and interestingly bombers are rather effective at fighter duties
general 2020-11-23 19:58:05 Isnt that the same for WoT?
general 2020-11-23 19:58:15 You have to grind through one vehicle to get the next
general 2020-11-23 19:58:19 such as War Thunder
general 2020-11-23 19:59:24 War Thunder was designed around people who like to try new things
general 2020-11-23 19:59:34 and like new experiences
general 2020-11-23 20:00:42 I used to play WoWS a lot, but I quite because of the RNG elements, the rather tedious grind, and the stupid long updates
general 2020-11-23 20:01:08 War Thunder lets you grind out any vehicle with any vehicle of the same tree.
general 2020-11-23 20:01:26 WoWS has a progression system that forces you to play one ship to grind the next one out
general 2020-11-23 20:02:11 Yeah
general 2020-11-23 20:02:19 or just abandon the entire line
general 2020-11-23 20:03:06 Honestly if you can endure the grind that War Gaming likes to put on you, then you can easily take on War Thunder
general 2020-11-23 20:03:21 cause that at least allows you to do what you want with what you have
general 2020-11-23 20:03:54 That tank looks more normal
general 2020-11-23 20:04:09 it looks like the classic first generation tank

general 2020-11-23 21:33:55 Actually his engines are fine except the second one. He has also sustained heavy fuselage damage, missing flaps, missing a rudder, and his tail gunner is dead
general 2020-11-23 21:35:22 He survived
general 2020-11-23 21:35:25 like
general 2020-11-23 21:35:27 half dead
general 2020-11-23 21:37:10 No
general 2020-11-23 21:37:13 His engines were fine
general 2020-11-23 21:37:18 Gaijin was saying they were dead
general 2020-11-23 21:37:29 but you could see and hear their prime power
general 2020-11-23 23:33:27 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-11-23 23:37:44 I would work there
general 2020-11-23 23:56:14 Well shoot guess I am not allowed to play jets either
general 2020-11-23 23:56:23 Gaijin seriously does not want me playing their game
general 2020-11-23 23:56:51 this keeps happening
general 2020-11-23 23:56:55 defeat
general 2020-11-23 23:56:56 defeat
general 2020-11-23 23:56:58 defeat
general 2020-11-23 23:57:02 more defeat
general 2020-11-23 23:57:36 Okay because my skill can win against 14 enemies in the new swedish jet
general 2020-11-23 23:57:45 as well as other jets
general 2020-11-23 23:57:49 that are always spaded
general 2020-11-23 23:58:17 Where did I blame my teams?
general 2020-11-23 23:59:02 I am always targeted in every game mode even if my entire enemy team is letting loose on the enemy
general 2020-11-24 00:00:00 Every game mode I am not a threat because I am stock and I have only 6 M2 machine guns
general 2020-11-24 00:00:03 not the M3
general 2020-11-24 00:00:08 which scream america
general 2020-11-24 00:00:13 I am not a threat
general 2020-11-24 00:00:17 I am just targeted
general 2020-11-24 00:00:18 why?
general 2020-11-24 00:00:24 Because Gaijin knows I am american
general 2020-11-24 00:00:49 Yeah and they should know what guns the plane has
general 2020-11-24 00:01:55 The A5 is literally the only American jet with the M2 .50 cals
general 2020-11-24 00:02:20 well
general 2020-11-24 00:02:21 no
general 2020-11-24 00:02:31 the P-59 has the M2
general 2020-11-24 00:02:39 which is Br 5.3
general 2020-11-24 00:02:40 for a jet
general 2020-11-24 00:03:46 Until the entire enemy team barrels down on you, or someone swoops in with engines off and you notice after you die
general 2020-11-24 00:04:28 Hmm because I cannot **hear** them
general 2020-11-24 00:04:30 or see them
general 2020-11-24 00:05:09 Yeah I played about almost every plane up till jets
general 2020-11-24 00:05:17 I am not a jello brain
general 2020-11-24 00:05:18 But
general 2020-11-24 00:05:21 the issue is
general 2020-11-24 00:05:22 I cannot
general 2020-11-24 00:05:39 before getting jumped by spaded jets a whole br higher
general 2020-11-24 00:05:45 I am talking jets noob
general 2020-11-24 00:06:40 I dont know who you are talking too

general 2020-11-24 16:08:40 Alaska moment
general 2020-11-24 16:09:16 Why do you need a model of the Kongo?
general 2020-11-24 16:10:36 Imagine if you could not disable autocorrect
general 2020-11-24 16:20:11 I got irritated with it real quickly
general 2020-11-24 16:20:18 I dont think it fits the game
general 2020-11-24 16:21:12 I would rather something like WoWS
general 2020-11-24 16:21:44 WoWS music just hits that certain sweet spot
general 2020-11-24 16:21:46 so calming
general 2020-11-24 16:22:15 Bet you cannot find my user in War Thunder

general 2020-11-24 16:27:07 yeah i guess
general 2020-11-24 16:27:20 but as performance becomes more important
general 2020-11-24 16:27:27 it gets worse
general 2020-11-24 17:42:55 spam ping
general 2020-11-24 17:42:56 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 18:53:46 mirror build more?
the-dump 2020-11-24 19:08:17 
general 2020-11-24 21:07:12 That is why I dont use that antivirus anymore
general 2020-11-24 21:07:29 It has nothing good about it
general 2020-11-24 21:07:43 unless you dump your life savings into the extensions
the-dump 2020-11-24 23:26:34 relatable
general 2020-11-24 23:30:36 What is that win rate
general 2020-11-24 23:30:44 32%
general 2020-11-24 23:30:52 out of 81 battles
general 2020-11-24 23:30:53 eeee
general 2020-11-24 23:32:38 nice map
general 2020-11-25 16:40:20 why do I keep getting these reminders
general 2020-11-25 16:40:34 What do you mean?
general 2020-11-25 16:42:10 They are not low speed turners
general 2020-11-25 16:42:13 Also
general 2020-11-25 16:42:25 Most american aircraft have good turning
general 2020-11-25 16:42:49 I out turned a spitfire in a mustang
general 2020-11-25 16:42:53 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-25 16:43:32 This was a low speed engagement. I should not have taken it else I would likely have died.
general 2020-11-25 16:43:43 No no no no
general 2020-11-25 16:45:08 You have the P-51, P-51 A, P-51 C, P-51 D-5, P-51 D-10, P-51 D-20, P-51 D-30 P-51 H-5, and the F-82 (I think) Twin mustang.
general 2020-11-25 16:46:01 hmm
general 2020-11-25 16:46:44 But you said almost all
general 2020-11-25 16:47:06 Probably said most the american planes I have
general 2020-11-25 16:47:09 not almost all
general 2020-11-25 16:47:27 You also need speed
general 2020-11-25 16:47:51 Not with the United States
general 2020-11-25 16:48:17 From 300-500 (sometimes 600) you turn very fast
general 2020-11-25 16:48:47 10-15 seconds is fast
general 2020-11-25 16:48:48 bruh
general 2020-11-25 16:50:03 Or use your keyboard
general 2020-11-25 16:50:10 Which is easier in most cases
general 2020-11-25 16:50:55 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-25 16:51:21 🔪
general 2020-11-25 16:51:37 thats racist
general 2020-11-25 16:52:51 Or get outclimbed
general 2020-11-25 16:53:09 The Bf-109 outclimbs most american planes
general 2020-11-25 16:53:49 Then try and slam them into the trees
general 2020-11-25 16:54:17 Then side climb
general 2020-11-25 16:54:28 Not climbing is worse then just climbing
general 2020-11-25 16:54:38 because then you have low energy if you dont climb
general 2020-11-25 16:55:13 "Speed is life but altitude is life insurance"
general 2020-11-25 16:55:50 They are not
general 2020-11-25 16:55:56 but they are making people pay for it
general 2020-11-25 16:56:05 which breaks more laws then they were breaking before
general 2020-11-25 16:56:17 And actually that would be a federal crime
general 2020-11-25 16:56:20 known as piracy
general 2020-11-25 16:56:31 No they dont
general 2020-11-25 16:56:43 The creator of the sound told them they can pay to use it
general 2020-11-25 16:56:51 And unless roblox payed for it
general 2020-11-25 16:57:10 Did roblox buy the sound?
general 2020-11-25 16:57:43 Yeah they took it from a random game
general 2020-11-25 16:57:49 the creator found out
general 2020-11-25 16:58:16 he got a little annoyed
general 2020-11-25 16:58:25 said they could pay for the sound to use it
general 2020-11-25 16:58:32 and roblox got mad and lashed out
general 2020-11-25 16:58:50 creating unnecessary drama
general 2020-11-25 16:59:30 That is cause when you first play you get paired with mostly bots. As you progress you eventually get paired with mostly players
general 2020-11-25 17:00:00 yes
general 2020-11-25 17:00:13 a what?
general 2020-11-25 17:00:26 oh nooo
general 2020-11-25 17:00:40 <:StopThat:559520667909881867>
general 2020-11-25 17:01:34 It is often best to start a rolling scissors with them. You cannot hit them, but they cannot hit you
general 2020-11-25 17:01:40 You bleed speed and full behind them
general 2020-11-25 17:01:44 where you can slap them
general 2020-11-25 17:02:27 Hold on imma collect some videos for you
general 2020-11-25 17:03:02 I think he missed
general 2020-11-25 17:03:04 or no
general 2020-11-25 17:10:09 20mm pew pew gun
general 2020-11-25 17:12:19 Keyboards
general 2020-11-25 17:21:20 Bruh I disconnected from the servers
general 2020-11-25 17:21:29 Short crew lock
general 2020-11-25 17:21:30 but
general 2020-11-25 17:21:32 why
general 2020-11-25 17:34:07 War Thunder is not pay to win for christ sakes
general 2020-11-25 17:34:19 You dont win games because you have a premium
general 2020-11-25 17:34:33 and you dont have to buy anything to do good in war thunder
general 2020-11-25 17:35:41 If you cannot play War Thunder without buying a whole bunch of premium vehicles then you should not be playing the game
general 2020-11-25 17:35:51 The game is not pay to win
general 2020-11-25 17:35:54 only you would be
general 2020-11-25 17:38:28 Unfortunately for that statement you can still win by not paying for anything and do godd
general 2020-11-25 17:38:46 Also who said that
general 2020-11-25 17:39:13 Again. Absolutely no paying to grind
general 2020-11-25 17:39:18 You do not need to buy anything
general 2020-11-25 17:39:21 absolutely
general 2020-11-25 17:39:22 nothing
general 2020-11-25 17:39:32 all you need to buy is a computer and internet
general 2020-11-25 17:40:20 I only ground a couple of hours
general 2020-11-25 17:41:35 You dont need to buy anything. You can give examples that may suggest paying to win, but there is absolutely nothing that prevents you from getting all the vehicles in the game, except yourself (and your teammates but that is a different story and a painful one)
general 2020-11-25 17:41:57 No I am not
general 2020-11-25 17:42:13 Yeah it is not pay to win
general 2020-11-25 17:42:34 At least from what I know
general 2020-11-25 17:42:51 what does that have to do with paying to win
general 2020-11-25 17:42:58 I dont have to buy anything to get top tier
general 2020-11-25 17:43:09 Bias yes
general 2020-11-25 17:43:13 Gaijin likes the bias
general 2020-11-25 17:43:33 Bias does not mean pay to win
general 2020-11-25 17:43:48 Premium and premium vehicles
general 2020-11-25 17:44:25 It is considered that, but by definition it is not
general 2020-11-25 17:44:42 Crossout is made by a different company. Gaijin just published it
general 2020-11-25 17:44:56 But Crossout

general 2021-03-21 22:44:49 When exactly where you born?

bot-central 2021-03-22 19:59:05 !servers
general 2021-03-22 20:36:36 That is going to bother me
general 2021-03-22 21:01:57 Nothing. It devolved
general 2021-03-22 21:02:15 No it has not
general 2021-03-22 21:03:57 I had a stroke when reading that
general 2021-03-22 21:04:28 Yeah pretty much
general 2021-03-22 21:25:06 Aim 100
general 2021-03-22 21:25:25 Cold rain to wake you up
general 2021-03-22 21:26:27 Sounds like you need to eat a banana and become happy
general 2021-03-22 21:28:06 That happens occasionally
general 2021-03-22 21:28:33 Wait I guess
general 2021-03-22 21:29:06 It could be your computer also
general 2021-03-22 21:31:11 Watch him refuse to actually complete the set of maneuvers required to successfully navigate the round-a-bout
general 2021-03-22 21:32:31 No that is nascar
general 2021-03-22 21:33:04 A round-a-bout is a continuous flow intersection
general 2021-03-22 21:34:16 What do you do when your Eurofighter Typhoon is outnumbered, or is within enemy territory where surface-to-air defenses can clap you
general 2021-03-22 21:38:52 Blue Cheese is like the one cheese I can say I do not like
general 2021-03-22 21:40:45 Go do something
general 2021-03-22 21:43:00 I need the WoWS weekend players to come back
general 2021-03-22 21:43:07 I need more money and XP
general 2021-03-22 21:51:00 <@!790732709559271444> Do you know of any WoWS ship that has a detection distance of 3 kilometers
general 2021-03-22 21:55:30 No
general 2021-03-22 22:10:30 WG RNG loving me on the weekends but hating me otherwise
general 2021-03-22 22:24:56 So in the matter of a day I managed to go from 2-3 kills per match, and often close, fun games, to whatever the heck this is.
general 2021-03-22 22:24:58 My luck
general 2021-03-22 22:25:01 Straight up sucks
general 2021-03-23 20:42:52 I have stopped playing War Thunder cause I was sick of all the whining that people brought on
general 2021-03-23 20:42:57 Like let me have fun
general 2021-03-23 20:43:11 Dont ruin it by getting mad at a shell going through a weak spot
general 2021-03-23 20:44:16 Also the skill required makes the game almost impossible to learn unless you are very patient
general 2021-03-23 20:46:10 Bruh I know how to play the game, but learning to play was harder than trying to push a SUV out of mud
general 2021-03-23 20:47:44 So we asking whether you put the milk in before the cereal, or vice versa. Why not ask if you drink the milk before eating the cereal or in reverse?
general 2021-03-23 20:49:39 Also tbh a bowl full of milk is a lot of milk
general 2021-03-23 20:49:52 You are legally required to drink the milk afterwards
general 2021-03-23 20:50:47 You are now verified to be verified
general 2021-03-23 20:52:18 When did you first play war thunder
general 2021-03-23 20:52:55 About 4 years ago you would not have to worry
general 2021-03-23 20:52:58 3 maybe
general 2021-03-23 20:53:07 2 definitely
general 2021-03-23 20:53:26 Learning how to not die

general 2021-03-23 20:58:52 I dont have an interest in ever playing WoT
general 2021-03-23 21:00:53 Triangle
general 2021-03-23 21:01:35 At least they would do better than me
general 2021-03-23 21:02:23 You probably could with just Roblox Studio
general 2021-03-23 21:03:41 Just uses meshes and unions <:thoink:657279634563399720>
general 2021-03-23 21:03:59 Get better computer than

general 2021-03-23 22:54:58 But was nice about it
general 2021-03-23 22:55:16 It died like a couple seconds after winning a WoWS match
general 2021-03-23 22:56:03 A decent one too
general 2021-03-23 22:56:19 Could have easily gotten 4 kills
general 2021-03-23 22:56:30 But RNG decided to distribute the wealth
general 2021-03-23 22:56:36 which is fine
general 2021-03-23 23:02:47 Osprey chain in <#384025409945337856> for some reason

general 2021-03-25 21:05:41 Are people still being toxic no-lifes in the chat?
general 2021-03-25 21:06:19 I meet them every match
general 2021-03-25 21:06:28 And I literally get teamkilled for being positive
general 2021-03-25 21:06:48 So you are forced to learn what you can and cannot post
general 2021-03-25 21:07:52 There was problems with people joining and posting inappropriate stuff

general 2021-03-27 23:03:47 But I got warned after showing a pic of a gif to report someone like an hour after obc told people not to show the pic
general 2021-03-27 23:04:00 Heck I made sure not to post the part where NSFW was showing
general 2021-03-27 23:05:11 I am honestly not even sure what my third warn that got me banned was
general 2021-03-27 23:05:27 The modlog said only Inappropriate comment
general 2021-03-27 23:06:57 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
general 2021-03-28 16:48:04 When your engine dies you can feather the props to decrease drag and thus be able to fly a little bit farther
general 2021-03-28 16:48:47 ALl you have to do is press a button

general 2021-03-28 16:49:56 Yeah exactly
general 2021-03-29 20:27:25 You have to reach a certain chat level
general 2021-03-29 20:34:42 Now and in space

general 2021-03-29 22:56:31 Dont you just love it when your rudder gets knocked out as you are about to dodge torpedoes
general 2021-03-29 22:56:52 Feels like getting hit by a rock
general 2021-03-29 22:57:09 M4A3
general 2021-03-29 23:00:19 Bruh imagine doing that to someone who is not even verified
general 2021-03-29 23:01:48 Either he is more popular, or you are a worse mod.
general 2021-03-29 23:02:21 Bruh when was he last online
general 2021-03-29 23:03:06 No seriously I have not seen hyperbit online since before I died
general 2021-03-29 23:03:33 You will probably get warned
general 2021-03-29 23:03:50 Useless ping
general 2021-03-29 23:03:52 Its in the rules
general 2021-03-29 23:04:58 Is the "image perms flex" going to become the new amogus of this server
general 2021-03-29 23:05:00 Like bruh
general 2021-03-29 23:05:40 I am honestly confused
general 2021-03-29 23:05:50 I am seeing so much negativity come out of war thunder
general 2021-03-29 23:06:00 But no one quits
general 2021-03-29 23:06:11 Except me but only due to the negativity
general 2021-03-29 23:06:52 Which is actually a good thin
general 2021-03-29 23:07:03 Even if you like those sort of games
general 2021-03-29 23:07:34 Germany is easy as long as you angle
general 2021-03-29 23:07:56 Angle the turret
general 2021-03-29 23:08:10 Same way you angle the tank
general 2021-03-29 23:08:58 I wiped out a whole duck herd of them in the first Panther
general 2021-03-29 23:09:07 About 5 of them came around a corner
general 2021-03-29 23:09:10 They all died
general 2021-03-29 23:09:35 Imagine being penned by everything
general 2021-03-29 23:10:34 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-03-29 23:11:06 Centauro annoys me
general 2021-03-29 23:11:25 I either like armor versus armor or get penned by my machine guns
general 2021-03-29 23:11:51 At this point we can say every nation suffers
general 2021-03-29 23:12:23 I was going to say only sweden does not suffer because pretty much no one plays it
general 2021-03-29 23:13:13 Sweden has a good air tree I am told but I am more likely to get into a naval match than a low tier match to unlock swedish planes
general 2021-03-30 20:47:06 F
general 2021-03-30 20:48:38 Tier V party
general 2021-03-30 21:21:16 Bruh the medals are different

general 2021-03-30 22:15:57 But this dude
general 2021-03-30 22:16:00 Has been sitting still
general 2021-03-30 22:16:02 Sniping from spawn
general 2021-03-30 22:16:05 Using HE
general 2021-03-30 22:16:20 And he got killed by secondaries
general 2021-03-30 22:16:34 Man must be new
general 2021-03-30 22:26:30 
general 2021-03-30 22:33:39 Oh goody

general 2021-03-31 20:12:40 Yes
general 2021-03-31 20:29:52 Oh the last time I did that I got teamkilled
general 2021-03-31 20:29:53 Twice
general 2021-03-31 20:31:07 I have seen so much arguing and negativity in War Thunder I can almost say that me not playing the game has made me genuinely happier
general 2021-03-31 20:32:45 All BR's, all gamemodes, all forms of communication
general 2021-03-31 20:33:29 What you want me to list them all?
general 2021-03-31 20:34:12 Why does it sound like somone is taking a jackhammer to a window
general 2021-03-31 20:35:59 Oh no not the Quaken
general 2021-03-31 20:50:21 Okay so the jackhammer has been replaced by a chainsaw
general 2021-03-31 20:50:26 I am very confused
bot-central 2021-03-31 21:00:23 !expertservers
general 2021-03-31 22:59:27 Yeah
general 2021-03-31 22:59:31 I rarely see it
general 2021-03-31 23:00:07 I feel like I do better at penning a maus from the turret than the hull
general 2021-03-31 23:00:20 Plus ammo can explode
general 2021-03-31 23:02:00 Bruh I am comfortable getting 1 kill every so often. I ground out most the American Air and Ground tech trees by being worse
general 2021-03-31 23:02:24 Wdym debatable?
general 2021-03-31 23:02:52 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-03-31 23:03:22 F
general 2021-03-31 23:03:34 I really hate that map
general 2021-03-31 23:03:49 Actually I hate a lot of maps
general 2021-03-31 23:03:59 There is not one map that I can say I like
general 2021-03-31 23:04:48 Man seeing all you play War Thunder makes me kinda want to play again
general 2021-03-31 23:05:13 But I really do not want to burn out all my patience
general 2021-03-31 23:05:32 Yeah but literally everyone would say that
general 2021-03-31 23:06:11 I have been having matches where I get first place without a kill or a cap
general 2021-03-31 23:06:19 And sometimes even no assists as well
general 2021-03-31 23:06:47 Thousand dollar vehicles
general 2021-03-31 23:08:19 Okay I have seen that pfp picture before, and I am pretty sure it would count as NSFW
general 2021-04-01 15:30:03 I kinda wanna join the minecraft server but I already play with friends
general 2021-04-01 15:35:28 I live in a small town with bad internet
general 2021-04-01 15:35:30 So shush
general 2021-04-01 15:44:53 I almost want to join the server to see if I can get a good nether spawn
general 2021-04-01 17:06:55 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-01 17:08:07 Yeah that is what happens when you are verified
general 2021-04-01 17:09:13 Quantum tunneling
general 2021-04-01 17:15:03 Why are we arguing over whether someone is a furry or not?
general 2021-04-01 18:36:25 Dita
general 2021-04-01 18:40:33 What version is the server

general 2021-04-09 22:34:42 very rare is kind of an overstatement
general 2021-04-09 22:35:48 Not Safe FOR Life
general 2021-04-09 22:36:16 I think my shift key got stuck when typing "for"
general 2021-04-09 22:36:47 Yeah
general 2021-04-09 22:37:02 There is a certain video that seems to be oddly popular
general 2021-04-09 22:37:39 Rickje is not safe for life

general 2021-04-09 22:50:24 And WoWS Clan recommendations put larger clans before smaller clans for some reason
general 2021-04-09 22:56:45 Probably for the better
general 2021-04-09 22:56:57 Unless you only want to see national or state parks

general 2021-04-11 16:34:45 no
general 2021-04-11 16:34:58 If I know anything about War Thunder
general 2021-04-11 16:35:22 Talk about War Thunder usually ends in disaster
general 2021-04-11 16:55:22 Tbh I feel like I do a little better when we loose
general 2021-04-11 16:56:49 Also it is a lot easier to grind credits at low tier than high tier

general 2021-04-11 17:23:15 By move tool I though you were talking about the original tool but you can drag instead of breaking your LMB
general 2021-04-11 17:24:47 Yeah you have to ask why exactly you get warned in Dm's
general 2021-04-11 17:25:15 Yes but unfunny is an opinion
general 2021-04-11 17:26:18 I am just straight up boring
general 2021-04-11 17:26:33 Not even unfunnny
general 2021-04-11 17:26:53 What do I do
general 2021-04-11 17:27:01 Other than not bully whitenames

general 2021-04-11 17:27:41 I hang out in VC sometimes
general 2021-04-11 17:27:44 But never talk
general 2021-04-11 17:28:20 Eh
general 2021-04-11 17:28:39 If you can prove that you are innocent in the matter
general 2021-04-11 17:28:47 Than you should be able to appeal
general 2021-04-11 17:29:06 What? No

general 2021-04-11 17:31:00 It is doing nothing
general 2021-04-11 17:31:21 This is odd, why do I like it
general 2021-04-11 17:35:06 Because I wanted to test out if CRTL + Zoom Out actually zoomed out

general 2021-04-11 19:46:02 Freaking year old region
general 2021-04-11 19:46:07 Yet I have not developed it all
general 2021-04-11 22:06:13 F for my 8 yo MP3 player
general 2021-04-11 22:06:14 Works
general 2021-04-11 22:06:18 But needs to be plugged in
general 2021-04-11 22:09:40 What is this "overpressure" mechanic I heard of
general 2021-04-11 22:22:26 I have not played for like 3-4 weeks except for like an hour to check out the Tail Spin event
general 2021-04-11 22:30:23 So my internet disconnected
general 2021-04-11 22:30:39 and for some reason that made WoWS stop responding and would use up all my resources
general 2021-04-11 22:30:41 ???
general 2021-04-11 22:31:07 Then I reconnected, then when the launcher opened up, my computer shut off internet access
general 2021-04-11 22:31:18 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-04-11 22:31:50 I swear I feed my computers
general 2021-04-11 22:33:07 And the occasional noodle
general 2021-04-11 22:35:22 literally the story of <#384025409945337856> in a nutshell
general 2021-04-11 22:36:02 You can smell the disappointment of individuals that actually try their best
general 2021-04-11 22:36:18 And yet those that do little get nothing
general 2021-04-11 22:36:55 Please dont make my idea of a expert only creations room a decent idea
general 2021-04-11 22:42:54 Gotaa love it
general 2021-04-11 22:45:25 Imagine <#384021699466756107>

general 2021-04-11 22:48:59 Oh yeah
general 2021-04-11 22:49:17 Indeed
general 2021-04-11 22:55:08 Bruh how do I manage to get destroyed by two destroyers trying to secure flanks
general 2021-04-11 22:55:13 Maybe I should let my team die for me
general 2021-04-11 22:56:05 Because murder is not something I should have on my mind
general 2021-04-11 22:56:08 And War Thunder players often give me that idea
general 2021-04-11 22:56:35 With their constant complaining and selfishness and failure to realize that the world is not their kingdom
general 2021-04-11 22:57:07 WoWS players at least have some respect
general 2021-04-11 22:57:46 Also I can at least improve how I play in WoWS
general 2021-04-11 22:58:06 as compared to War Thunder which your skill in battle seems to determined by pure luck
general 2021-04-11 23:00:01 War Thunder could easily make me mad enough to commit a crime given specific circumstances that I am unsure are against the rules to list
general 2021-04-11 23:00:33 Wdym realistic?
general 2021-04-11 23:00:47 It can apply to custom battles
general 2021-04-11 23:00:57 I have gotten mad custom battles
general 2021-04-11 23:01:10 Granted I was already on edge from all the other gamemodes
general 2021-04-11 23:01:12 But still

plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:02:08 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:03:15 Master ranks get you nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:03:19 At least from what I know
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:04:13 Master rank both means you are an exceptional builder and you bribed a lot of people
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:05:28 I mean master rank could be easy to get if you are in good terms with everyone
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:05:48 but people who are not even verified still somehow manage to insult someones family line
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:07:32 There is something I really really want to do
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:07:33 But
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:07:44 My computer has not enough power
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:07:56 nor do I have the ability to run 9 roblox accounts at one time

general 2021-04-13 19:49:12 Cause a medicine ball hit my face, and forced my lip into my braces, simply tearing my lip apart, but yet it does not hurt. I feel like it should though

general 2021-04-13 22:46:55 Matchmaking

general 2021-04-13 23:00:31 Full torp volley moment
general 2021-04-13 23:01:40 No I decided to ammo rack a Vladivostok
general 2021-04-14 00:51:29 So I feel like organizing my random nouns my brain can come up with an assigning them to a Paradian warship
general 2021-04-14 00:51:30 Some
general 2021-04-14 00:51:31 maybe
general 2021-04-14 00:51:36 2000+ words
general 2021-04-14 00:52:00 Because mass producing warships
general 2021-04-14 00:52:16 This is what happens when mods are asleep
general 2021-04-14 00:52:35 Wait
general 2021-04-14 00:54:38 Should I create individual classifications for warships? Such as gun boat destroyers, torpedo boat destroyers, and AA boat destroyers. Same for other warship types?
general 2021-04-14 00:57:31 Wait what should the first class of paradian destroyers
general 2021-04-14 00:58:06 That actually is not a bad name
general 2021-04-14 00:58:11 Parade Class
the-dump 2021-04-14 01:00:51 Actually I can say something to prevent it
the-dump 2021-04-14 01:01:01 I legally cannot be forced to be a furry if I say no
general 2021-04-14 01:02:10 Cod or Codd?
general 2021-04-14 01:02:25 I like something along the lines of cod for a destroyer name
general 2021-04-14 01:06:44 So according to my flawed counting and wikipedia
general 2021-04-14 01:06:57 the US has designed 34 destroyers
general 2021-04-14 01:08:18 Salem...
general 2021-04-14 01:08:28 Salem class of destroyers?
general 2021-04-14 01:09:54 Mega is all seeing

general 2021-04-14 01:13:59 You cannot fail to spell
general 2021-04-14 01:14:43 So I just realized something
general 2021-04-14 01:15:48 So I came up with two names for the first Paradian destroyer
general 2021-04-14 01:15:52 Cod was chosen
general 2021-04-14 01:17:07 But I did not realize, that the torpedo that would be responsible for kicking off destroyer construction is also responsible for blowing up entire schools of fish
general 2021-04-14 01:17:32 I even stated that the torpedo was essentially a "ineffective fishing tool."
general 2021-04-14 01:18:22 The torpedo was supposed to damage warships
general 2021-04-14 01:18:45 Not detonate when it found a shoal of fish
general 2021-04-14 01:20:58 <:what:644996672048463942>

plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:36:45 I am tangling my brain over that question
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:36:55 That is what I want to go with
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:38:12 The Americans and British classed them as cruisers, and the Germans as battleships
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:36 Well that becomes an issue with my imaginary ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:01 Paradians essentially disregard armor
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:19 And this became essentially apparent on the Linvia class battleships
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:34 18.8 inch guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:41 37.5 knot max speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:54 Pretty much no armor for a battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:43:49 You know what
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:44:02 I will just put them as their own classification

general 2021-04-15 02:22:26 "It is impossible to create a system that detects when the game crashes."
-Actual statement from Gaijin
general 2021-04-15 02:22:47 The funny thing is everyone gets a alert when the game crashes
general 2021-04-15 02:22:52 Same with freeze detection
general 2021-04-15 02:23:10 Also how Gaijin blames their server issues on the player side
general 2021-04-15 02:23:26 No the game literally knows when it crashes
general 2021-04-15 02:23:40 Yet Gaijin refuses to not punish the players for it
general 2021-04-15 02:24:10 But at least it is better than WoWS which has no system in a first place
general 2021-04-15 02:24:21 Your ship is locked until a match ends

general 2021-04-16 20:58:50 Rather a small technique
general 2021-04-16 20:59:45 A lot of people do actually
general 2021-04-16 20:59:53 Its just War Thunder has a lot more problems
general 2021-04-16 21:00:00 So people talk about that instead
general 2021-04-16 21:00:42 Imagine being the color of decomposed potatoes
general 2021-04-16 21:01:20 
general 2021-04-16 21:01:42 I have a whole book series more than you
general 2021-04-16 21:05:40 Imagine think everyone has money to spend
general 2021-04-16 21:12:25 Pretty much
general 2021-04-16 21:13:36 No
general 2021-04-16 21:16:48 I am bored
general 2021-04-16 21:17:08 Anyone have something I can play
general 2021-04-16 21:17:14 Also event when
general 2021-04-16 21:17:55 There are between none and all of them
general 2021-04-16 21:18:36 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-16 21:18:40 I need to use my main account more
general 2021-04-16 21:19:21 I shall play Zepellin wars cause that is in my recently played
general 2021-04-16 21:19:33 Also I like AA guns
general 2021-04-16 21:20:20 **STOP TAKING AWAY MY FPS**
general 2021-04-16 21:20:38 :absolute_pain:
general 2021-04-16 21:20:56 I swear I get a roblox update every day
general 2021-04-16 21:21:07 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-04-16 21:21:19 That sketchy as heck
general 2021-04-16 21:21:30 That probably is going to result in about a million lawsuits
general 2021-04-16 21:21:36 As if google has not had enough already
general 2021-04-16 21:22:24 Wait Mega what are you doing that requires your age to be verified?
general 2021-04-16 21:22:46 Yeah probs
general 2021-04-16 22:06:08 Got kicked from Zepellin Wars for an unspecified reason
general 2021-04-16 22:06:13 Right after we all got this hammer
general 2021-04-17 16:28:45 Yeah
general 2021-04-17 16:32:55 Usually it is because you build common builds, are just generally bad, or you make tutorials
general 2021-04-17 16:33:09 Or in rare cases, you are a very good builder, but have no roles
general 2021-04-17 16:33:24 In which case like half the server will become jealous
general 2021-04-17 16:37:06 You cannot blame them half the time though
general 2021-04-17 16:37:10 Servers suck a lot
general 2021-04-17 16:37:21 Unstable connections
general 2021-04-17 16:37:39 Yes
general 2021-04-17 21:24:15 **FIRST KRAKEN** <:squam:801278498156183562>
general 2021-04-17 21:24:18 I feel acomplished
general 2021-04-17 21:26:57 I think I made my mouth bleed or something trying to get that Kraken cause I looked down and there was blood on my thumb and I had that iron taste in my mouth
general 2021-04-17 21:27:00 Makes sense though
general 2021-04-17 21:27:06 My braces will cut anything
general 2021-04-17 21:38:54 yep
general 2021-04-17 21:49:45 Got a new dinghy
general 2021-04-17 21:50:25 Cant be overmatched <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2021-04-17 21:55:23 Love how it is an armored cruiser and not an actual battleship
general 2021-04-17 21:55:54 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
general 2021-04-17 21:59:00 Unfortunately I have only 11k credits
general 2021-04-17 21:59:27 11k credits can only buy me a tier I ship
general 2021-04-17 21:59:30 which are free
general 2021-04-17 22:00:44 There is an elementary school near me that was built to withstand nuclear blast
general 2021-04-17 22:00:49 It used to be an old military base
general 2021-04-17 22:00:56 Now it is a school
general 2021-04-17 22:01:06 vool
general 2021-04-17 22:01:16 No
general 2021-04-17 22:01:31 You do not have my location
general 2021-04-17 22:01:38 1. Because it is in a large city
general 2021-04-17 22:01:40 and 2.
general 2021-04-17 22:01:46 I dont live in said city
general 2021-04-17 22:02:38 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-17 22:04:05 How big of a radius are you going to look though?
general 2021-04-17 22:04:10 If you look in just the one city
general 2021-04-17 22:04:21 Not counting anything around the city
general 2021-04-17 22:04:31 You have about 50,000 people to ask
general 2021-04-17 22:04:33 roughly
general 2021-04-17 22:04:42 based on probably 10 year old census numbers
general 2021-04-17 22:05:47 You are the one that has an odd interest in my location
general 2021-04-17 22:06:08 So you should know how big of an area you would estimate in
general 2021-04-17 22:06:45 You dont even know what state I live in
general 2021-04-17 22:07:23 Unless you were here for a long time, and watched the chat
general 2021-04-17 22:07:27 But did not speak at all
general 2021-04-17 22:08:06 september or december of what year?
general 2021-04-17 22:11:01 A town near us when I lived in North Dakota had a nuclear bomb shelter
general 2021-04-17 22:11:09 Capacity for some 120 people
general 2021-04-17 22:11:26 Also had a convenient glass door
general 2021-04-17 22:11:57 Actually no
general 2021-04-17 22:12:12 North Dakota is important
general 2021-04-17 22:12:45 Seeing as there were about 3 different nuclear silos within a scenic drive of our location
general 2021-04-17 22:12:58 Also Minot has a major air base
general 2021-04-17 22:13:53 Imma play Zeppelin wars
general 2021-04-17 22:13:58 Incase anyone wants to join me
general 2021-04-17 22:14:51 If I remember correctly
general 2021-04-17 22:14:54 Which I probably dont
general 2021-04-17 22:15:17 If we nuked each city with a population of 500k or more with 3 nuclear bombs each
general 2021-04-17 22:15:25 There would be about 1000 left overs
general 2021-04-17 22:16:15 You have so much to die of
general 2021-04-17 22:16:34 Yeah if you are at the point of detonation you have nothing to worry about
general 2021-04-17 22:16:40 You will literally turn into a gas
general 2021-04-17 22:16:49 Hello
general 2021-04-17 22:17:01 I have a feeling this conversation is going to trigger a mod
general 2021-04-17 22:17:44 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2021-04-17 22:18:29 Yes but talking about dying to a nuclear explosion can get NSFW really quick
general 2021-04-17 22:50:49 Wait how did you post
general 2021-04-17 22:51:02 Man does not have image role
general 2021-04-18 15:01:55 cats seem to have a connection with boxes
general 2021-04-18 15:52:59 This is what happens when you try and kick off the only person that wants to try and win
general 2021-04-18 15:53:07 We had been boarded
general 2021-04-18 15:53:08 30
general 2021-04-18 15:53:09 times
general 2021-04-18 16:09:00 Apparently the only tactic is to die
general 2021-04-18 16:09:06 I was trying
general 2021-04-18 16:09:08 to get people
general 2021-04-18 16:09:11 to fire the guns
general 2021-04-18 16:09:14 and repair damage
general 2021-04-18 16:09:51 Apparently the tactic in zepellin wars is to get boarded and die
general 2021-04-18 16:20:59 Maybe
general 2021-04-18 16:21:04 I dont know the plans for today
general 2021-04-18 16:25:34 uh oh
general 2021-04-18 16:26:09 it keeps getting worse
general 2021-04-18 16:26:45 TWO TIMES IN A ROW
general 2021-04-18 16:33:04 THREE TIMES IN A ROW
general 2021-04-18 16:33:38 Apparently the most effective way to destroy and airship is to just knock the decks off
general 2021-04-18 16:38:08 k

general 2021-04-18 19:13:46 Its not very nice
general 2021-04-18 19:14:28 It is cold, it is slippery, it gets every where, it makes driving hard, and you have to clean it up because it is slippery
general 2021-04-18 19:14:34 It can become ice
general 2021-04-18 19:14:36 which is snow
general 2021-04-18 19:14:37 but worse
general 2021-04-18 19:14:39 and solid
general 2021-04-18 19:14:56 State only does roads

creations-chat 2021-04-20 00:25:45 I really don't know. Next time do not appeal.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 00:27:46 I had a stroke when I heard something was going down in this channel. I could only imagine the conditions of the argument.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 00:30:02 This channel needs a special chat filter that deletes pretty much every negative word. Cause holy cow this channel is very accident prone.

general 2021-04-20 01:03:21 No one will be building that
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:05:13 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:05:35 French warships were on the faster side
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:05:40 That thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:05:44 Looks like it would never move
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:05:53 Those tracks would snap under stress
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:06:12 and the weight of the ship would cause it to sink in the soil
the-dump 2021-04-20 01:08:22 That would infact be NSFW
the-dump 2021-04-20 01:10:08 Its literally connected directly something that is inappropriate, you should have assumed that it would not be allowed.
the-dump 2021-04-20 01:11:22 not panther
the-dump 2021-04-20 01:13:56 I am pretty sure it is NSFW mainly due to how it can be directly connected to very NSFW activities
the-dump 2021-04-20 01:14:51 Ask OBC since he is alive

creations-chat 2021-04-20 19:49:27 Bruh ranks do not determine how good someone is at building.

general 2021-04-20 22:29:38 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-20 22:40:34 it is though
general 2021-04-20 22:42:16 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2021-04-20 22:46:28 **Can we not argue for once**
general 2021-04-20 22:47:23 I know but the arguing genuinely makes me upset
general 2021-04-20 22:47:24 very
general 2021-04-20 22:47:25 upset
general 2021-04-20 22:50:17 I am in a server full of germans
general 2021-04-20 22:50:18 help
general 2021-04-20 22:50:27 Where is the soviet bias
general 2021-04-20 22:56:48 Why are we bullying a whitename
general 2021-04-20 22:56:57 Or are you warning him
general 2021-04-20 22:57:00 I cannot tell
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:01:06 become l o n g
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:01:25 I am wondering how I can do the last bit of the bow
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:02:01 Also I am wondering if I should switch to the dark gray wooden deck that I used on my last ship since that looked rather nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:05:08 I really like this look, but this ship came about 10 years after the one I am building now. So resource availability, technology, construction techniques, and the fact that this ship is a wartime design make a lot of differences
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:05:10 I dunno
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:05:23 I might keep the current deck for my destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 23:06:14 So much vibrate
general 2021-04-20 23:07:25 So there is this thing I have unplugged on my floor
general 2021-04-20 23:07:30 the prongs are facing right up
general 2021-04-20 23:07:37 I just stepped on the prongs
general 2021-04-20 23:07:44 <:squam:801278498156183562>
general 2021-04-20 23:08:04 I already have that <:LULW:719972409947717727>
general 2021-04-20 23:08:16 Its so expensive
general 2021-04-20 23:08:33 no
general 2021-04-20 23:08:42 I stopped playing War Thunder a while ago
general 2021-04-20 23:08:57 And stopped playing air battles well before that
general 2021-04-20 23:09:12 This is why I cannot play war thunder anymore
general 2021-04-20 23:09:24 Serious or not, players are very toxic
general 2021-04-21 01:01:35 You cannot go
general 2021-04-21 01:01:40 You are stuck here forever
general 2021-04-21 01:11:44 so
general 2021-04-21 01:11:44 Okay
general 2021-04-21 01:11:50 I am going to be mean to myself
general 2021-04-21 01:12:08 Gonna make myself name 127 warships of an individual class
general 2021-04-21 01:12:11 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-04-21 01:12:27 Now imma gonna make myself do that at least 3 more times
general 2021-04-21 01:12:31 give or take 30 ships
general 2021-04-21 01:19:07 Yeah filtered words is either be careful, or I guess type them in chat and see if you get autowarned by dyno.
general 2021-04-21 01:19:18 I especially have to be careful
general 2021-04-21 01:19:33 Cause there is a full on dictionary of NSFW words that I do not even know exist
general 2021-04-21 01:20:52 I am very surprised I have only one warn for an NSFW remark
general 2021-04-21 01:21:01 I dont remember what the NSFW remark even was
general 2021-04-21 01:21:05 or why it was NSFW
general 2021-04-21 01:23:04 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-21 01:23:11 Hold on I got a dictionary
general 2021-04-21 01:24:24 its spelled Grammar
general 2021-04-21 01:25:00 At least according to page 282 of the Webster's New Dictionary
general 2021-04-21 01:25:34 Oh yes please do that
general 2021-04-21 01:25:47 That would save my family so much stress
general 2021-04-21 01:26:11 Yeah im good
general 2021-04-21 19:46:06 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2021-04-21 19:46:33 Bad cropping
general 2021-04-21 19:46:36 The font is different
general 2021-04-21 19:46:44 Also the symbol is wonk
general 2021-04-21 19:51:40 Rickje best mod now
general 2021-04-21 19:51:46 He made fart channel

general 2021-04-21 19:52:26 Will be very red
general 2021-04-21 19:52:28 Like
general 2021-04-21 19:52:33 a deep dark red
general 2021-04-21 19:54:20 If he gets by literally anything he will die, but he can take more damage
general 2021-04-21 19:54:27 also vip1 empty once again
general 2021-04-21 20:03:49 
general 2021-04-21 20:09:03 My discord randomly crashed
general 2021-04-21 20:09:09 Rickje no longer best mod
general 2021-04-21 20:19:58 Oh dear

general 2021-04-21 20:28:29 WOOOOOO
general 2021-04-21 20:38:10 I got an hour and a half cooldown in <#834516152054841354> when the slowmode is an hour and I did not even send a message
general 2021-04-21 20:40:18 I cant build a tank<:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2021-04-21 20:58:19 Yes but if no new messages are sent in 3 picoseconds then chat is dead
general 2021-04-21 20:59:18 yes
general 2021-04-21 21:13:09 How do you see that
general 2021-04-21 21:13:39 But it was never in archives
general 2021-04-21 21:13:44 let alone its own category
general 2021-04-21 21:14:37 Never, Heres why:
general 2021-04-21 21:15:40 no dont do that
general 2021-04-21 21:15:57 <:LULW:719972409947717727>

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 21:21:34 no
general 2021-04-21 21:22:07 Because rick did not want mega to touch fart channel so rick touched it first
general 2021-04-21 21:22:17 or something like that
general 2021-04-21 21:46:46 long boat
bot-central 2021-04-21 21:51:15 !expertservers
general 2021-04-21 22:07:45 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 22:09:29 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 22:09:44 Troll alarms going off
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 22:10:18 legit
general 2021-04-21 22:11:12 Fart channel is fake
general 2021-04-21 22:11:35 Impossible
general 2021-04-21 22:11:41 You must have been
general 2021-04-21 22:12:09 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:29:28 Could have just been inspired and decided to try it out on his own build
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:33:57 This is how arguments start and why there is a two minute slowmode
general 2021-04-21 22:36:05 DMs, and roles are a huge thing here
general 2021-04-21 22:36:21 So just about everyone active will see your discord name
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:36:38 Too much toxicity and random insults
general 2021-04-21 22:38:54 Its not snitching because the mods would figure out regardless
general 2021-04-21 22:39:06 Yeah that works
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:39:49 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2021-04-21 22:40:36 I mean
general 2021-04-21 22:40:52 he did leave because he did not want to change his name for an event
general 2021-04-21 22:40:58 Which is something almost no one would do
general 2021-04-21 22:41:35 They usually do it seconds before warns, or will just get themselves banned because of their stubbornness
general 2021-04-21 22:42:34 Yeah pretty much normal
general 2021-04-21 22:45:49 WHO STOLE MY FIRE
general 2021-04-21 22:46:20 I WAS ENJOYING THE FIRE SOUND
general 2021-04-21 22:53:32 I have 90 dollars to spend on a PC <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:57:33 No
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:57:38 Like bruh
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:57:45 Yes
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:57:47 but
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:58:01 oh for fricks sake
the-dump 2021-04-21 22:58:20 That meme alone could cause a huge argument
creations-chat 2021-04-21 22:59:41 A block is more than a feet
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:00:04 I probably would
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:00:24 You would be amazed what I can mess up
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:00:28 Also I am not scared of spider
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:00:53 Honestly I am more scared of killing a spider because they crunch up in these little balls
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:00:59 And if it is a large spider
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:01:03 <:empty:794431705070174238>
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:01:16 I would rather not get spider juice all over
general 2021-04-21 23:02:31 You do realize he is new
general 2021-04-21 23:02:34 and learning
general 2021-04-21 23:03:35 Yeah but I have been here for 2 and a half years and I cannot build a tank
general 2021-04-21 23:04:36 A wedge and a turret would get me creations blacklist
general 2021-04-21 23:04:56 I tried to build a tank once
general 2021-04-21 23:05:00 It was so basic
general 2021-04-21 23:05:01 Like
general 2021-04-21 23:05:09 it hurt me
general 2021-04-21 23:06:35 I do better with large builds that dont use much motor lock
general 2021-04-21 23:06:41 I cannot understand motor lock
general 2021-04-21 23:06:44 other than bare basics
general 2021-04-21 23:07:15 This was <#504436696021204992>
general 2021-04-21 23:07:19 Not creations
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:10:54 Imma go
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:11:20 Someone tell me how long it takes for a mod to respond
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:11:31 when a mod responds
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:12:19 Possibly suggestive
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:13:23 This is why we cannot have nice things
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:13:54 If it would concern your teacher
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:13:56 do not post it
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:15:23 Yes but this server is ridden with hidden rules and so it is best to just not post it unless the meme is perfectly normal
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:16:32 Grab will confirm this
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:16:46 He used to be mod
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:17:07 How about 5 minutes
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:17:54 We did
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:18:01 And he will get warned
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:18:32 Would you go to work showing that?
the-dump 2021-04-21 23:18:57 Any way
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 00:44:43 That would make me so mad that I would never get anywhere
general 2021-04-22 01:13:08 So I was looking at a photo I took
general 2021-04-22 01:13:24 this photo
general 2021-04-22 01:13:33 and I realized
general 2021-04-22 01:13:37 that is a gun
creations-chat 2021-04-22 01:16:35 Lots of practice, time, tears, and testing
general 2021-04-22 01:19:53 And rick keeps trying to get a lot of youtuber attention so yeah
general 2021-04-22 01:21:09 That and people often go WAY too far
general 2021-04-22 01:21:30 Like I have seen real arguments
general 2021-04-22 01:21:38 And they
general 2021-04-22 01:21:45 they really are not good
general 2021-04-22 01:24:49 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-22 20:07:21 Okay my mental sanity is going to be lost soon
general 2021-04-22 20:07:24 Simply because of money
general 2021-04-22 20:09:01 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-22 20:10:08 Cannot really compare War Thunder to DCS though
general 2021-04-22 20:10:45 War Thunder and DCS are straight up different
general 2021-04-22 20:11:07 the only similarities are they are video games focused around vehicle combat
general 2021-04-22 20:11:12 that is basically it
general 2021-04-22 20:14:38 Dubai
general 2021-04-22 20:15:51 Yes
general 2021-04-22 20:16:17 You could probably just hook up an entire plane and it would probably work
general 2021-04-22 20:17:11 Also I find it funny that parents are so set and spoiling their children with fancy phones that it has ended up to be needed to do homework
general 2021-04-22 20:17:18 Like bruh
general 2021-04-22 20:17:43 My science teacher is making us do a scavenger hunt for earth day and it required phones
general 2021-04-22 20:17:53 I shocked her when I said I do not have one
general 2021-04-22 20:18:42 Like I swear
general 2021-04-22 20:19:12 If I have to go to someone who managed to go insane in one week just because his wife got some money
general 2021-04-22 20:19:19 At least let me do my homework
general 2021-04-22 20:19:21 I am like
general 2021-04-22 20:19:23 mad
general 2021-04-22 20:19:43 What is happening in war thunder
general 2021-04-22 20:19:52 I have not played in like a month
general 2021-04-22 20:19:59 2017 i think
creations-chat 2021-04-22 20:20:49 What is up with the glass?
general 2021-04-22 20:21:49 I have used more than 50 engines in a build
general 2021-04-22 20:22:21 It is unrealistically difficult to get a boat to 1/8 the speed it would travel at in the real world
general 2021-04-22 20:23:03 aerodynamics?
general 2021-04-22 20:23:10 Blocks dont have drag
general 2021-04-22 20:23:18 Only wings and hover thrusters
general 2021-04-22 20:23:43 That literally adds drag and is counter-intuitive
general 2021-04-22 20:26:03 I wanna play War Thunder
general 2021-04-22 20:26:07 but I am reluctant
general 2021-04-22 20:29:12 Okay but what if you keep the ship from flipping over using no method except just classic naval engineering
general 2021-04-22 20:31:21 Ahh I cannot play War Thunder right now
general 2021-04-22 20:31:25 I would get mad
general 2021-04-22 20:38:09 just pull up
general 2021-04-22 20:39:25 Just pull up
general 2021-04-22 20:39:42 You dont need a pilot

general 2021-04-22 20:43:59 screw it im playing war thunder
general 2021-04-22 20:44:55 I am going to be so just frustrated by the end of the day
general 2021-04-22 20:48:52 I have 10 days of premium left
general 2021-04-22 20:49:03 bruh I wasted 50 days of premium

general 2021-04-24 18:34:41 Got Gaijined
general 2021-04-24 18:34:53 Froze up and somehow flipped my aircraft
general 2021-04-24 18:35:02 killed my pilot instantly
general 2021-04-24 18:36:32 41,400 stock
general 2021-04-24 18:45:00 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2021-04-24 18:45:29 Blame Gaijin making the graphics better so that less people can enjoy them
general 2021-04-24 18:48:24 There is math involved if you want to make a scale model of a vehicle that can reach the exact speed of the original vehicle
general 2021-04-24 18:49:08 yeah
general 2021-04-24 18:50:14 There is no creation rank in the first place
general 2021-04-24 18:50:25 ?rhelp
general 2021-04-24 18:50:42 So were you
general 2021-04-24 18:52:38 Wait crew lock expired
general 2021-04-24 18:52:58 It expired 20 minutes ago
general 2021-04-24 18:53:15 Now it work
general 2021-04-24 18:53:25 He is a developer
general 2021-04-24 18:53:30 Just not for Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:53:56 That hull makes me realize just how bad I am at making hulls
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:54:06 Especially aft sections
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:54:16 Not that I said I was good at making hulls
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:54:18 But like
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:54:23 Wow do I suck
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:55:06 Concept dreadnought
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:56:04 You can tell designers knew they would be a kamikaze target so Bofors spam cubed
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:56:46 "When in doubt, just add more bofors."
-Not the US Navy but still works
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:57:03 single mounts
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:57:06 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:57:18 Oh that is nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:58:36 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:59:53 Oh dear
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:00:12 I think they did stuff like that with destroyers
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:00:18 Kinda like the americans
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:00:22 Dual purpose artillery
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:00:52 AA boats can engage ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:01:13 The shear amount of shells will tear apart everything on the deck which is not armored
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:01:21 Which is pretty much everything but the mains guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:03 AA
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:08 Tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:09 Ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:12 A very big bomb
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:37 That is why the bomb is very big
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:49 So the explosion or resulting shrapnel would take down the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:03:58 Yeah look at this mess
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:14 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:46 Granted it is better than my battlecruiser which had entire holes in the hull
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:58 Just because I used 1x2 half wedge up
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:05:22 Bruh just make half slab 1x2 like there is the half slab
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:05:30 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:05:59 Wait why are they all the same color
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:06:15 They are so close in color
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:06:16 Like
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:06:17 how
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:07:30 Love how the bad builders think they are good
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:07:38 And the good builders think they are bad
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:07:55 And here I am going with not bad not good
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:05 The problem with this server is there is no definable good or bad
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:16 There is also an odd bias against anyone without a role
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:27 So even if you build like a master builder
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:30 If you have no roles
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:37 You automatically get clapped
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:09:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:10:30 Excuse me how did this happen twice
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:10:36 This happened when I joined the server
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:10:52 and when I despawned the ship I was not teleported back to my plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:11:09 so hippity hoppity reset my property
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:11:18 and now I am in the middle of the map
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:11:35 Plus a couple thousand downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:12:29 Dont forget the random kid who never speaks and never builds and just downvotes random creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:12:34 Often the good creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:12:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:13:15 You also have people who vote for whichever number is highest regardless of their opinion of the build
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:15 I assume the image perms applies to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:26 Since the whole purpose is to prevent raids
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:32 So that helps some
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:42 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:15:12 That would help some
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:15:46 But then you would have kids posting their builds in other channels as if they were <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:16:01 So it would have to be aligned with image roles
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:17:12 Roblox servers seem to be currently dying
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:18:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:18:16 Now it do be 100
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:18:35 Which is actually a nice number since achieving that is pretty hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:19:13 barely?
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:19:26 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:20:32 yeah but 110 would not do much in that regard
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:20:51 You will still have the issue of people being at the minimum regardless of the limit
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:22:13 Oh yeah that makes more sense
the-dump 2021-04-24 19:22:40 Seen that a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:23:45 Example being my attempt for HoF
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:24:18 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:25:18 I personally feel like master rank should be the way to get in instead of contest winner
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:25:58 Master ranks are much harder to get
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:26:54 Unless you are this dude
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:27:20 Not a very good build compared to basically everything else
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:27:44 I think the A-10 is nicer
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:27:53 plus you can see everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:28:02 Unlike that tank which has the blinding sun
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:29:30 I have a bad habit of posting builds like a week after I complete them
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:29:36 In one case I waited 2 months
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:30:58 One day I am going to look at the time when all the HoF creations where posted to see if there is a pattern
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:31:10 Monke brain math to maximize upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:31:36 And hopefully dodge low quality creations and random undes that never speak
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:31:54 Also meme builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:34:33 Expert supreme is one of those ranks you get with time and dedication
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:35:38 that guy?
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:36:03 There are a few with expert supreme
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:49:37 Modeler is an old rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:49:41 Impossible to get pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:49:43 But
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:49:58 there is a small chance you get it from a HoF build
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:50:00 but by small
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:50:15 Means like quark small
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:51:38 At least I did not go down to string small
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:52:40 Bug fixes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:53:32 Did anyone get inventor for the conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:53:35 or hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:54:12 Could have just had a rock paper scissors battle to see who gets the role
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:55:21 So if I became a dev and added something to the game, say, actual cannons. I get inventor
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:56:31 If you know what the words mean than it does not help anything
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:58:04 Other than mass transit via sub
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:58:33 welp time to get perm banned
creations-chat 2021-04-24 20:00:45 <:KEKW:670310537300672528> not nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:01:23 Make the original creation better
the-dump 2021-04-24 20:02:44 Haha motor glitch go brrrrrrrr
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:05:41 It changed gameplay in public pvp servers like a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:08:13 I legit have no idea what the camera glitch even is
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:12:28 I made this AA turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:12:34 And it either shreds or does nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:12:40 but I always get hits with it
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 20:12:46 And for some reason I never get hit
general 2021-04-24 20:32:04 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-04-24 20:32:13 Gaijin going places
general 2021-04-24 20:32:37 460k viewers
general 2021-04-24 20:32:47 The most I have seen for War Thunder was about 40k
general 2021-04-24 20:47:41 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 23:00:57 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 23:01:07 Cannot make a decision yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 23:01:21 Needs the rest of the ship for the deck to look good
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 23:01:43 sip
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 13:44:17 I was going to say, not asking for feedback is a good thing because of that reason.
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 13:44:34 <#504436696021204992> is probably the most toxic channel
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 13:44:49 Hence why there is a 2 minutes cooldown
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 13:45:42 Arguments happen regardless
general 2021-04-25 14:23:51 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-25 14:27:45 Also you might wanna get an expert rank first else you are at a disadvantage for HoF
general 2021-04-25 14:33:35 9:33 am stop being on the other side of the world
general 2021-04-25 14:36:33 You are gonna have to walk cause I got no money
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:48:25 Parade of the kids
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:49:00 it goes to who sent the message
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:51:15 calm
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:51:56 There is no button
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:53:47 <:LULW:719972409947717727>
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:57:56 That usually takes a while
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:58:16 Does not help that no one pinged him
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:59:09 <@!195253906333368320> Awaken thy great one of the skies

plane-crazy 2021-04-25 15:09:23 3 and then you get executed
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 15:09:45 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>

general 2021-04-25 15:58:26 Yeah often when something goes wrong about 5 different mods are pinged
general 2021-04-25 15:58:49 And it takes 2 or more minutes for a response a lot of the time
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:00:18 Hax
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:02:09 Roblox moderation sucks
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:02:12 Both auto mod
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:02:14 and Manual
general 2021-04-25 16:06:47 My premium is about to expire I should probably use it
general 2021-04-25 16:13:12 A lot of people play War Thunder
general 2021-04-25 16:13:25 And like only one or two World of Tanks
general 2021-04-25 16:13:34 And there is me who plays World of Warships
general 2021-04-25 16:13:53 That might only be one
general 2021-04-25 16:14:07 There are couple that play that
general 2021-04-25 16:14:38 Then you have fonkl who plays fortnite
general 2021-04-25 16:15:08 I have never been a fan of FPS shooters

general 2021-04-25 16:19:48 407 kb/s
general 2021-04-25 16:19:55 That used to be normal for me

general 2021-04-25 16:24:41 Nothing happens here
general 2021-04-25 16:25:05 The only time I saw police in action was like 3 years ago when there was a car chase
general 2021-04-25 16:25:08 But that has been it

plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:27:10 I can be happy with 3fps
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:27:12 Like bruh
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:28:53 I remember when I used to build oil rigs
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:29:08 I started playing and I built like 3 oil rigs
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:29:18 Which were considered decent for that time
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:29:19 Now
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:29:23 Very bad
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:30:48 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:31:11 That might not be the completed thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:31:14 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:31:33 yeah this
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:31:54 Those builds were fun to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 16:32:33 Basically
general 2021-04-25 22:26:17 Bruh
general 2021-04-25 22:26:25 I have been gone for like 5 hours

general 2021-04-25 22:37:26 Love how as I clean out my various screenshot folders all the selection pics will be randomly copied
general 2021-04-25 22:37:37 So then I have to go back and select the copies to delete them
general 2021-04-25 22:38:48 Okay this is stupid
general 2021-04-25 22:38:56 I just managed to copy the copies again
general 2021-04-25 22:39:02 And then copied the copies
general 2021-04-25 22:39:03 How
general 2021-04-25 22:39:05 Why

general 2021-04-25 22:46:36 Purge complete
general 2021-04-25 22:46:41 I figured out how to cheat
general 2021-04-25 22:46:51 But also how to copy about 500 pics at once
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 22:52:38 Could actually get banned for that though

general 2021-04-25 23:03:58 You have become me
general 2021-04-25 23:04:25 Probably for the better
general 2021-04-25 23:04:35 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2021-04-25 23:05:16 I dunno I will have to google that
general 2021-04-25 23:05:18 but a lot
general 2021-04-25 23:05:24 Also why are you interested
general 2021-04-25 23:32:59 yes
general 2021-04-25 23:36:49 Did anyone point this out yet?
general 2021-04-25 23:37:47 Which is impossible btw
general 2021-04-25 23:37:55 It would have to be 10 minutes
general 2021-04-25 23:38:03 and I was doing homework
general 2021-04-25 23:38:04 or rather
general 2021-04-25 23:38:09 Outdoorwork
general 2021-04-25 23:38:55 No 13
general 2021-04-25 23:40:16 In the case that member count was being talked about, then it would be 12-24 hours
general 2021-04-25 23:40:32 I dont know how long
general 2021-04-25 23:40:37 It was a thing only today
general 2021-04-25 23:40:52 But I logged in with about 3 members left till 20k
general 2021-04-25 23:42:06 yes
general 2021-04-25 23:42:14 It is very underwhelming tbh
general 2021-04-25 23:42:46 Revolt got stuck in traffic and obc keeps getting stuck in the door cause bunny = big
general 2021-04-25 23:42:54 So obc cant leave
general 2021-04-25 23:44:33 Did not get gaijined
general 2021-04-25 23:44:35 Like me
general 2021-04-25 23:44:44 Who froze up on takeoff
general 2021-04-25 23:44:46 flipped
general 2021-04-25 23:44:47 and died
general 2021-04-25 23:45:27 And yet I can somehow land a plane at 100km/h through an entire forest and be okay
general 2021-04-25 23:45:41 Help my cat is trying to take over my desk
general 2021-04-25 23:48:08 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-25 23:49:08 If your neck gets crushed it does not matter how it gets crushed
general 2021-04-25 23:49:17 **you are going to die**
general 2021-04-25 23:49:37 Not to mention whatever else might have been crushed
general 2021-04-25 23:49:54 Such as your skull, brain, internal organs, your phone
general 2021-04-25 23:50:54 Yes because it is totally possible to survive a very accurate belly flop from an american fighter aircraft
general 2021-04-25 23:51:24 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-25 23:53:15 Yeah I did too
general 2021-04-25 23:53:23 But I get gaijined a lot
general 2021-04-25 23:54:03 Such as a APDS shell with 300mm of pen failing to go through mudflaps
general 2021-04-25 23:54:19 I will just buy the snail then
general 2021-04-25 23:54:44 I be noob

general 2021-04-25 23:55:22 Apparently there is this random ping feature
general 2021-04-25 23:55:28 which is what it sounds like
general 2021-04-25 23:55:30 and I swear
general 2021-04-25 23:55:48 how unlucky would you be if you pinged someone random and that random was rick or madattak
general 2021-04-25 23:56:27 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-25 23:58:50 Skill and physisc
general 2021-04-26 00:03:43 I am almost tempted to record sounds from various war thunder matches and just compile them together
general 2021-04-26 00:03:49 I could probably fall asleep to that
general 2021-04-26 00:04:20 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-26 00:06:58 Oof
general 2021-04-26 00:07:03 It is not really interesting
general 2021-04-26 00:07:06 but granted
general 2021-04-26 00:07:21 I live in areas where the grass can grow up to your shoulders
general 2021-04-26 00:08:08 Sounds delicious
general 2021-04-26 00:08:41 Then how are getting scammed?
general 2021-04-26 00:09:06 huh??
general 2021-04-26 00:09:39 Oh yeah discord scroll bug thingy
general 2021-04-26 00:09:44 It gets me a lot
general 2021-04-26 00:09:46 And I hate it
general 2021-04-26 00:10:20 It has gotten me at least 20 times
general 2021-04-26 00:14:27 Okay so
general 2021-04-26 00:14:36 It took me about a year to realize something
general 2021-04-26 00:14:45 it is simple
general 2021-04-26 00:14:47 very simple
general 2021-04-26 00:14:55 and I came up with this in middle school
general 2021-04-26 00:15:00 yet it managed to slip my mind
general 2021-04-26 00:15:22 So all the custom warships I make
general 2021-04-26 00:15:42 Have a identification thingy
general 2021-04-26 00:15:47 like USS or HMS
general 2021-04-26 00:16:22 My ships have PNS (Paradian Navy Ship)
general 2021-04-26 00:16:32 Say that too fast and then you get comedy
general 2021-04-26 00:16:40 So yeah
general 2021-04-26 00:17:27 Bruh I would be such a bad mod
general 2021-04-26 00:17:47 I am mentally incapable of noticing anything that could be NSFW or suggestive
general 2021-04-26 00:18:06 Unless of course it do be obvious
general 2021-04-26 01:51:07 I would too
general 2021-04-26 01:51:27 No a yoke is like a steering wheel for aircraft

general 2021-04-26 20:40:18 No kids
general 2021-04-26 20:40:41 Dragons are cool
general 2021-04-26 20:40:50 That is also a song
general 2021-04-26 20:40:56 Which is not cool
general 2021-04-26 20:41:12 Also weird video to go with it
general 2021-04-26 20:42:16 Imagine saying the word
general 2021-04-26 20:42:31 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
general 2021-04-26 20:43:54 Dragons would be cool not only because strong fast and scary, but because you can break so many FAA regulations
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 20:47:13 I do too
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 20:47:27 I just go with British annoying thing

general 2021-04-26 22:13:23 How did I get first place
general 2021-04-26 22:14:01 What the heck
general 2021-04-26 22:14:08 I did so badly
general 2021-04-26 22:14:17 How did I get first
general 2021-04-26 22:14:39 Did they buff the score you get from taking damage?
general 2021-04-26 22:14:48 Cause I tanked shots from like 4 different tanks
general 2021-04-26 22:14:53 2 of which were german heavies
general 2021-04-26 22:15:35 Okay I gotta play with my graphics
general 2021-04-26 22:15:42 I would rather not have an average fps of 2
general 2021-04-26 22:17:08 I used to get good FPS at high graphics
general 2021-04-26 22:17:10 Now
general 2021-04-26 22:17:23 Now
general 2021-04-26 22:17:34 I have to put my graphics to almost minimum
general 2021-04-26 22:22:53 👍
general 2021-04-26 22:23:27 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-26 22:37:36 I am thoroughly confused
general 2021-04-26 22:37:46 I saw an Abrams
general 2021-04-26 22:37:57 In a 6.7 match
general 2021-04-26 22:38:07 I also so tanks that were ghosts
general 2021-04-26 22:38:10 Like
general 2021-04-26 22:38:14 I dunno how to explain it
general 2021-04-26 22:38:18 They were not dead
general 2021-04-26 22:38:24 But they were not controlled by anything
general 2021-04-26 22:38:55 Not until I can figure out why Gaijin hates me
general 2021-04-26 22:39:23 I keep having problems no one else is having
general 2021-04-26 22:39:41 I might just have to go back and repair files
general 2021-04-26 22:39:58 Well first of all I saw an Abrams in a 6.7 ground match
general 2021-04-26 22:40:06 That
general 2021-04-26 22:40:40 Because an aircraft cant handle a child touching it for some reason
general 2021-04-26 22:40:55 Nor can it handle my unnaturally low fps
general 2021-04-26 22:41:18 **HOW**
general 2021-04-26 22:42:00 Smh imma grind the early churchills and just become a bunker
general 2021-04-26 22:42:16 Because all my score is just me getting beat up
general 2021-04-26 22:42:34 So if I take a big thing and angle it
general 2021-04-26 22:42:43 I could probably just grind SL that way
general 2021-04-27 20:06:06 How do I keep calm in an impossible situation that could very well give me PTSD if I dont have it already
general 2021-04-27 20:06:11 A crazy person is one thing
general 2021-04-27 20:06:19 A crazy person that knows what they are doing is way worse
general 2021-04-27 20:06:29 I am slowly loosing myself
general 2021-04-27 20:07:31 No, but at the same time no one can guarantee that it is not
general 2021-04-27 20:10:44 I know that, but unfortunately the person that is making me very uncomfortable knows this, and I am afraid he could very well prevent me from actually calling 911
general 2021-04-27 20:20:04 My dad has been showing extreme cases of multiple personality disorder, PTSD, and lack of self control. He has been impulsive, recently seperated from his fourth relationship, that being his third marriage. He disappeared for about a month, in that time somehow traveling to Wisconsin and Kenya in the matter of days and month at the same time. He also said he had an interview in Kenya for the Dave Ramsey show, came back a week later, and said he had an interview for the Dave Ramsey show. Now he refuses to care about me and my brother's emotions, and refuses to answer anyone's question. He is apparently with this friend who lives in Texas, saying that he would move there (taking about two weeks to tell anyone) and said he would take us to Disneyland. Now he is saying Florida. Now he is saying he is not moving, and refuses to mention having a relationship with anyone. In the event that he is not moving, we would be sleeping on air mattresses in what is supposed to be a recording studio in a two bedroom duplex with 2 other people. Those people being his mom, and her roommate who has kids. He refuses to accept my mom is actually my mom, that she is employed, and refuses the fact that I have Aspergers Syndrome, which he keeps going back and forth with
general 2021-04-27 20:20:14 wont
general 2021-04-27 20:20:14 and the only people that can do anything about it
general 2021-04-27 20:20:19 they straight up dont care
general 2021-04-27 20:20:33 That person being our lawyer
general 2021-04-27 20:21:33 In order to get anything done at the moment, there has to be proof that me or my brother are being abused physically
general 2021-04-27 20:22:04 The fact that this has been happening for 10 years is why I can still do my math homework at least
general 2021-04-27 20:23:01 My mom also has about 5 different health conditions, and the stressed caused by this can just simply knock her out
general 2021-04-27 20:23:17 For entire days
general 2021-04-27 20:23:36 Leaving me and my brother forced to care for ourselves
general 2021-04-27 20:24:05 He was getting therapy and was anti depressants before
general 2021-04-27 20:24:08 Now that is not happening
general 2021-04-27 20:25:15 The issue with that is his mom owns the house, and I have no idea if he is actually moving or not
general 2021-04-27 20:25:37 If in the event he breaks down
general 2021-04-27 20:25:46 There is no idea I can go but outside away from the place
general 2021-04-27 20:26:23 And that house is in the same area where you get alerts on your phone about some dude with a gun attacking people every week
general 2021-04-27 20:26:39 It also gets really freaking hot
general 2021-04-27 20:27:19 The only help I can get is coping techniques, and a lawyer that actually cares
general 2021-04-27 20:27:27 Preferably one that does not cost as much as a new car
general 2021-04-27 20:28:20 Struggling to figure out what my biggest interest is
general 2021-04-27 20:28:30 It is going to involve engineering
general 2021-04-27 20:28:31 that is for sure
general 2021-04-27 20:28:37 but what exactly is unknown
general 2021-04-27 20:29:32 I used to do that a lot when I was younger
general 2021-04-27 20:29:36 that kinda fell out
general 2021-04-27 20:31:03 I wanna get a 3d printer and learn 3d modelling to build larger scale model warships just as a hobby
general 2021-04-27 20:31:25 Not like small models
general 2021-04-27 20:31:33 I know
general 2021-04-27 20:32:47 The only issue I have is stamina
general 2021-04-27 20:32:55 I find it difficult to do one thing for a long time
general 2021-04-27 20:33:07 Kinda both
general 2021-04-27 20:33:15 Mostly mental though
general 2021-04-27 20:33:17 yeah
general 2021-04-27 20:33:20 perks of Aspergers
general 2021-04-27 20:33:28 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-04-27 20:33:56 It happens with stuff that I am interested in
general 2021-04-27 20:34:25 Stuff that I am not interested in I cannot do without going crazy
general 2021-04-27 20:35:30 I simply want to do something else
general 2021-04-27 20:36:14 It helps if it something were I am constantly using my brain and/or hands
general 2021-04-27 20:36:29 But it does not take long for me to just want to stop
general 2021-04-27 20:37:15 That is something I cant do very well
general 2021-04-27 20:37:27 My dad really hates that
general 2021-04-27 20:37:28 Like a lot
general 2021-04-27 20:37:43 Also I like to go slower because then I know I will not be making mistakes
general 2021-04-27 20:38:02 Such as knocking a whole pot of something onto the floor
general 2021-04-27 20:38:10 Or perhaps a whole table in one case
general 2021-04-27 20:38:45 I typoed in the multitasking response

general 2021-04-27 20:39:31 I know he loves me as his son, but as a person he hates me
general 2021-04-27 20:39:43 Same about my opinions about him
general 2021-04-27 20:39:54 I love him as my father, want to hurt him as a person
general 2021-04-27 20:40:57 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>

general 2021-04-27 21:18:26 But not there
general 2021-04-27 21:19:42 Tanks are not loading in
general 2021-04-27 21:19:59 Others just randomly disappear
general 2021-04-27 21:20:18 Not sure what is happening here

general 2021-04-28 22:02:41 Virus cubed?
general 2021-04-28 22:03:30 Avast sucks
general 2021-04-28 22:03:35 You have ot buy everything
general 2021-04-28 22:03:46 It uses more ram than Chrome with 10 tabs open
general 2021-04-28 22:03:58 And it does not work unless you buy everything
general 2021-04-28 22:05:13 Literally the only reason I need an antivirus is because of homework. I will have to go to random sites to complete homework.
general 2021-04-28 22:06:35 I barely even mod minecraft
general 2021-04-28 22:06:53 Literally the only mods I have on were installed to just to play with a friend
general 2021-04-28 22:07:00 and I am too lazy to remove them
general 2021-04-28 22:07:51 Oh also the recent War Behold update fixed my lag spikes
general 2021-04-28 22:07:58 So I can go back to medium graphics
general 2021-04-28 22:08:12 and not minimum with an average 2 fps
general 2021-04-28 22:09:04 Also Ru 251 HESH can overpressure an entire M103 from the front
general 2021-04-28 22:09:07 True experience
general 2021-04-28 22:09:23 Wdym
general 2021-04-28 22:09:26 I really like it
general 2021-04-28 22:09:40 M103 is probably my most favorite heavy
general 2021-04-28 22:10:17 There are a lot of city maps

general 2021-04-30 20:55:05 I am getting unde vibes
general 2021-04-30 20:56:02 **AT LEAST 99%**
general 2021-04-30 20:56:29 First of all shredder users is very vague
general 2021-04-30 20:56:43 Pretty much everyone uses shredders
general 2021-04-30 20:57:34 Second of all banning them is simply immoral being that it is a game feature
general 2021-04-30 20:57:46 Third of all, that is a huge amount of people
general 2021-04-30 20:59:03 Banning them is not what you do
general 2021-04-30 20:59:10 You simply remove the issue
general 2021-04-30 20:59:15 which only rick can do
general 2021-04-30 20:59:56 That is like banning people for using cellphones
general 2021-04-30 21:00:01 Its really
general 2021-04-30 21:00:02 really
general 2021-04-30 21:00:03 stupid
general 2021-04-30 21:00:24 How do you meet a discord?
general 2021-04-30 21:01:07 Not it is not
general 2021-04-30 21:02:26 Lots of things. Lag bombs, hacks, and toxic people
general 2021-04-30 21:04:08 Everyone gets attacked, but how does that relate to banning shredder users?
general 2021-04-30 21:05:14 Its not advertising if someone asks for the link
general 2021-04-30 21:07:07 Where did you get those statistics?
general 2021-04-30 21:07:36 Can I see the data?
general 2021-04-30 21:08:16 So then your statistics do not matter
general 2021-04-30 21:09:22 Supposedly
general 2021-04-30 21:09:42 Also he is talking about shredder users, not shredder bug users
general 2021-04-30 21:10:12 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2021-04-30 21:13:16 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-04-30 21:13:23 Sexual identity?
general 2021-04-30 21:14:09 Wdym sexual identity?
general 2021-04-30 21:15:19 Well you got terminated so there is a very high chance you are
general 2021-04-30 21:15:34 It takes a special kind of argument to get terminated
general 2021-04-30 21:16:39 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-05-01 17:56:41 War Thunder update?

general 2021-05-01 19:15:20 Was messing around with ships
general 2021-05-01 19:15:28 But there were two kids that really hated ships
general 2021-05-01 19:15:46 And were just relentlessly killing the group of maybe 5 of us

general 2021-05-01 21:23:11 to avoid exploiters
general 2021-05-01 21:24:19 You really have to give this game credit though
general 2021-05-01 21:24:29 One of the oldest games
general 2021-05-01 21:24:55 I think he went to college
general 2021-05-01 21:24:59 And likely got a job
general 2021-05-01 21:25:31 I know Galaxy updates used to be very rare because their game owner was in the military
general 2021-05-01 21:26:06 Indeed
general 2021-05-01 21:26:12 Have not played in a while though
general 2021-05-01 21:26:28 It gets boring though
general 2021-05-01 21:26:34 Kinda grindy
general 2021-05-01 21:26:44 And battles just make the game even more grindier
general 2021-05-01 21:27:24 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2021-05-02 22:39:41 Then everything is cheap
general 2021-05-02 22:40:22 1000+ dollars for a phone that is worth maybe 300 dollars

general 2021-05-05 19:55:14 Bruh my school is so stupid
general 2021-05-05 19:55:16 Actually
general 2021-05-05 19:55:25 wreckless
general 2021-05-05 19:55:41 There was a gas leak in the elementary school for 3 days now
general 2021-05-05 19:55:47 And it was only shut off now
general 2021-05-05 19:56:01 School for little kids
general 2021-05-05 19:56:27 It is really one school
general 2021-05-05 19:56:35 Or I dunno
general 2021-05-05 19:56:43 How my school is organized is wierd
general 2021-05-05 19:56:47 It is one single school
general 2021-05-05 19:56:52 but 2 buildings
general 2021-05-05 19:56:59 Hard to describe
general 2021-05-05 19:58:15 but like the elementary had a gas leak for 3 days, yet never closed. It made the preschool kids sick, and the kitchen staff
general 2021-05-05 19:58:23 One of the kitchen staff being my mom
general 2021-05-05 19:58:43 If the gas found an ignition source
general 2021-05-05 19:59:05 The elementary school had a gas leak for 3 straight days
general 2021-05-05 19:59:17 And the administration refused to do anything
general 2021-05-05 19:59:31 Just like they refuse to fix the roof in the highshool and middleschool
general 2021-05-05 19:59:57 Killing approximately 20 children and my mother
general 2021-05-05 20:00:12 No but I am serious
general 2021-05-05 20:00:40 No but if it had found an ignition source
general 2021-05-05 20:00:56 It was natural gas
general 2021-05-05 20:01:13 It made my mom sick
general 2021-05-05 20:01:47 Its a gas used for heating and cooking, and sometime refrigeration
general 2021-05-05 20:02:00 It is colorless and odorless
general 2021-05-05 20:02:06 but a smell is added to it
general 2021-05-05 20:02:11 That smell being like rotten eggs
general 2021-05-05 20:02:19 And the smell is very strong
general 2021-05-05 20:02:32 yes
general 2021-05-07 19:45:19 Saw starlink satellites last night
general 2021-05-07 19:45:23 Chain of 12

general 2021-05-07 19:45:56 My neighbors freaked out
general 2021-05-07 19:49:07 Not really. It prevents many accidents.
general 2021-05-07 19:52:47 Very dependent but you can find some aggressively nice people

general 2021-05-07 20:41:24 Winrates are more ARB
general 2021-05-07 20:41:33 Since one person can have a much better influence
general 2021-05-07 20:42:48 You cant
general 2021-05-07 20:42:56 You go to their BR
general 2021-05-07 20:43:03 Then you dont get uptier
general 2021-05-10 01:16:44 ARB can be worse
general 2021-05-10 01:17:20 My premium expired not too long ago and I am already hurting
general 2021-05-10 01:17:49 Premium is a must pretty much
general 2021-05-10 01:17:58 Unless you are exceptionally good
general 2021-05-10 01:18:02 otherwise you need premium
general 2021-05-10 01:18:55 Fortunately 180 days of premium is 20 dollars when it is on sale
general 2021-05-10 01:19:00 which is very much worth it
general 2021-05-10 01:19:46 👍
general 2021-05-10 01:20:05 rice water?
general 2021-05-10 01:20:52 Well that depends on what br you are playing, and at what time.
general 2021-05-10 01:21:52 Boosters dont actually change anything in the game except the reward multiplier

general 2021-05-10 01:31:26 Tiny Tims are fun
general 2021-05-10 01:31:54 Especially when you score a direct hit
general 2021-05-10 01:36:30 They are essentially really fast bombs
general 2021-05-10 01:37:07 They are smaller bombs so you need to learn to aim
general 2021-05-10 01:37:40 but once you learn to aim it is pretty much a guaranteed kill
general 2021-05-10 01:39:47 Why do people do that
general 2021-05-10 01:40:05 I have never understood the concept of staying up until hours before you would normally have to get up
general 2021-05-10 01:40:11 It is actually unhealthy
general 2021-05-10 01:40:26 Yes but like half my school does that and they brag about it
general 2021-05-10 01:40:50 But granted people have been bragging about illegal stuff
general 2021-05-10 01:43:10 I dont know if I can say what some kids have been bragging about without getting warned
general 2021-05-10 01:43:19 but that alone should give you an idea of what happens
general 2021-05-10 01:43:46 I hate people for their lack of reasoning

general 2021-05-10 01:45:03 Yeah but how does where I live mean anything in this situation

general 2021-05-11 01:21:04 Though in all honesty. The R3 T20 can be killed by literally anything, and the recoil on the gun can make it hard to get on target sometimes. The main issue with the R3 is that it gets abused during grindy events which can quickly overwhelm the opposite team. Otherwise it just gets slapped.

general 2021-05-14 01:02:22 Literally not one object in this solar system has a perfect orbit
general 2021-05-14 01:02:28 And probably not one in the universe
general 2021-05-14 01:03:03 electrons
general 2021-05-14 01:03:07 possibly
general 2021-05-14 01:03:25 the universe really likes spheres
general 2021-05-14 01:03:28 but that is about it
general 2021-05-14 01:04:28 yes that is basically every star
general 2021-05-14 01:04:37 but the thing is
general 2021-05-14 01:04:44 if star orbits were perfect
general 2021-05-14 01:04:54 we would not make the galaxies like the milky way
general 2021-05-14 01:05:09 they would be these really weird discs
general 2021-05-14 01:11:22 Hold gonna post something here just to make my life easier

general 2021-05-16 19:34:42 and issues with jets not rendering
general 2021-05-16 19:41:14 for some reason roblox now plays videos attached to game pages automatically

general 2021-05-19 01:23:41 yikes

general 2021-05-19 01:24:40 My school kinda played around with online stuff
general 2021-05-19 01:24:51 just decided that full in person would be better
general 2021-05-19 01:25:02 simply because like half the students were refusing to do work
general 2021-05-19 01:25:08 and they still are refusing to do work

general 2021-05-19 01:29:23 Like the only people that will panic if you show any signs of not being healthy is maybe one of our neighboring towns, and the school nurse who will send families home for covid testing because one kid had a headache
general 2021-05-19 01:29:43 Probably everyone
general 2021-05-19 01:30:04 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2021-05-19 22:21:35 So many large copper veins too
general 2021-05-19 22:21:46 might have to make a base down here
general 2021-05-19 22:22:16 I bypassed like 10 different warpers and they pretty much ignored me
general 2021-05-19 22:26:44 Yeah but guarded by a ghost leviathan in a tight corridor
general 2021-05-19 22:26:45 shear drop too
general 2021-05-19 22:27:02 so not ideal for either the prawn suit or the cyclops
general 2021-05-19 22:27:58 but now your cyclops will be left for the ghost leviathan
general 2021-05-19 22:28:13 also getting back up will be an issue
general 2021-05-19 22:28:48 I just my cyclops over by the northern ghost leviathan behind a big rock
general 2021-05-19 22:29:40 its much easier to navigate since the drops are stepped
general 2021-05-19 22:29:47 also much closer to my main base
general 2021-05-19 22:31:08 yo where the frick are the two dragons
general 2021-05-19 22:31:20 how do I get all the way down here with literally no trouble

general 2021-05-19 22:31:28 no warper attacks*
general 2021-05-19 22:31:53 no lava larvae doing lava larvae things
general 2021-05-19 22:32:10 no weird lava snack things attacking me
general 2021-05-19 22:33:00 smaller cave, no real objects to hide you, and lake of lava
general 2021-05-19 22:33:11 but sea dragons are dumb
general 2021-05-19 22:33:28 I think they are there just to be scary rather than anything you need to worry about
general 2021-05-19 22:34:46 found one
general 2021-05-19 22:36:05 lmao
general 2021-05-19 22:36:19 okay the second one literally looked at me as I went into the thing

general 2021-05-19 22:39:39 he literally shrugged off afterwards
general 2021-05-19 22:40:07 I think the creatures have decided that I am not interesting
general 2021-05-19 22:40:24 cause the only thing that scares me are amp eels

general 2021-05-31 20:27:59 Okay I can reply now
general 2021-05-31 20:44:07 Anyone here play astrocraft and know how turrets work?
general 2021-05-31 20:52:53 turret
general 2021-05-31 20:53:49 Its a game and its technically a modded f3x
general 2021-05-31 20:54:02 Astrocraft
general 2021-05-31 21:12:45 shiny
general 2021-05-31 21:26:42 no
general 2021-05-31 21:27:00 spaceship with capabilities for atmospheric flight
general 2021-05-31 21:29:45 Oh doing the cockpit for the ship is going to be so difficult
general 2021-05-31 21:30:02 Since it is supposed to be a high visibility space
general 2021-05-31 21:30:16 which means a lot of glass
general 2021-05-31 22:08:37 pain
general 2021-05-31 22:15:22 Making the outer hull and the cockpit glass for this is going to be so hard
general 2021-05-31 22:15:29 what am I doing with my life
general 2021-05-31 22:15:56 Yes
general 2021-05-31 22:28:58 I just realized the layout of my ship is quite similar to that of the Subnautica Cyclops
general 2021-05-31 22:29:05 Minus the fact there is no lower deck
general 2021-05-31 22:30:58 You have the cockpit, a small area behind that, then a large area behind that, with the engine room at the end
general 2021-06-01 14:13:52 How did you get a bts member by typing V?
general 2021-06-01 14:16:05 Looks like the Viper from Galaxy but imma bet that ship was made after something else that I do not know.
general 2021-06-01 15:59:16 How is this for a first build
general 2021-06-01 15:59:27 Like the canopy
general 2021-06-01 15:59:30 How is it
general 2021-06-01 17:28:28 This server is like slowly turning into Astrocraft
general 2021-06-01 17:30:13 That number keeps growing
general 2021-06-01 18:58:52 counter
general 2021-06-01 21:12:03 graphics
general 2021-06-01 21:21:58 I just gave my ship the biggest blind spot ever for the one turret it has
general 2021-06-01 21:22:53 It literally cannot fire out to the sides now
general 2021-06-01 21:23:22 aeronautical
general 2021-06-01 21:49:15 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-06-01 22:15:01 Well that is the aft structure done
general 2021-06-01 22:15:19 Now that leaves the mess at the bow
general 2021-06-02 15:11:40 I love that the new War Thunder update occurs today
general 2021-06-02 15:11:50 The day when I have almost no time to play
general 2021-06-02 15:11:58 and wont have time to play for the next 5 weeks
general 2021-06-02 15:12:05 which is better than the original 8 weeks
general 2021-06-02 15:12:15 but is still better than the normal 11 weeks
general 2021-06-02 15:12:19 no
general 2021-06-02 15:12:29 dang it missed the reply
general 2021-06-02 15:12:33 no
general 2021-06-02 15:12:39 I dont*
general 2021-06-02 15:16:15 It probably will be since that is against the ToS
general 2021-06-02 15:16:59 USA, Germany, and sometimes Sweden for the memes
general 2021-06-02 15:17:50 give them the login information and they can
general 2021-06-02 16:18:36 Help I am allergic or something
general 2021-06-02 16:19:16 I am allergic to something in it
general 2021-06-02 16:20:43 this is what the inside of my ship looks like for some reason
general 2021-06-02 16:21:15 I can see the counter
general 2021-06-02 16:21:17 For some reason
general 2021-06-02 16:21:36 Also the cockpit is <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-06-02 16:43:36 
general 2021-06-02 16:43:38 fun
general 2021-06-06 02:15:08 indeed
general 2021-06-06 02:19:38 I swear I have been pinged more in the last few days than the last month
general 2021-06-06 02:20:23 No I only got like 4 pings from this server
general 2021-06-06 02:21:25 You have been counting?
general 2021-06-06 02:22:23 Man where did you get those extra 4 brain cells to do that
general 2021-06-06 02:22:48 I struggle to count to 15 6 times
general 2021-06-06 02:23:32 If you count the turbines then you would be correct
general 2021-06-06 02:23:44 but most people only count the engine assembly
general 2021-06-06 02:32:06 I literally only have a kindle to use for the next 32 days
general 2021-06-06 02:38:12 I am getting depressed just looking through the astrocraft discable server
general 2021-06-06 02:38:29 I also need to stop looking at the time
general 2021-06-06 02:38:58 Saw it
general 2021-06-06 02:39:44 Wait your ship was much smaller
general 2021-06-06 02:40:11 how did you create a ship so fast
general 2021-06-06 02:40:44 and many more planned to be added
general 2021-06-06 02:41:07 guns and other weapons
general 2021-06-06 02:41:33 yes but they are still planned
general 2021-06-06 02:41:47 no it falls forever
general 2021-06-06 02:42:26 they still will be effective
general 2021-06-06 02:44:00 I like how I am building based off of things I come up with when I sit in chair or sleep knowing very well that it will not work well in astrocraft
general 2021-06-06 02:46:05 Does my Utility Cruiser count?
general 2021-06-06 02:47:03 My ship is already big compared to a lot of things
general 2021-06-06 02:47:31 Moving at light speed would be underwhelming though
general 2021-06-06 02:48:26 Yes because flying around in a big blue spaceship that is also rated for atmospheric flight is sneaky
general 2021-06-06 02:49:08 But granted utility cruisers where often tasked for scouting missions
general 2021-06-06 02:49:18 yes
general 2021-06-06 02:49:38 It is already round
general 2021-06-06 02:50:01 There is going to a lot of wedges
general 2021-06-06 02:50:13 especially since it is my first ship
general 2021-06-06 02:50:52 what do you think i did?
general 2021-06-06 02:52:46 But I have like 20+ ships of that family to improve on the high visability canopy
general 2021-06-06 02:53:07 Plus what fighters I build in between
general 2021-06-06 02:53:46 Also note that those ships will be to scale
general 2021-06-06 02:53:54 so they will get b i g
general 2021-06-06 02:54:28 At least for astrocraft standards
general 2021-06-06 02:55:18 roblox character
general 2021-06-06 02:55:53 so if a roblox character was as big as the average human
general 2021-06-06 02:55:57 that scale
general 2021-06-06 02:57:29 Just to keep with scale to your ships?
general 2021-06-06 03:02:09 Okay so what would you think of a ship, that if it crashed onto a planet, the fuel that it would store would explode with enough force to literally eject the planet's atmosphere and create a pressure wave that alone would literally vaporize the surface of the planet
general 2021-06-06 03:02:26 Like with enough force to disrupt the orbit of that planet
general 2021-06-06 03:03:19 fun times lay ahead
general 2021-06-06 03:03:51 no it would just have to rupture a fuel storage
general 2021-06-06 03:04:52 that is what 52 million tons of anti-hydrogen would do
general 2021-06-06 03:05:41 Actually you might be able to get away with just 5 million tons
general 2021-06-06 03:05:57 your pfp now
general 2021-06-06 03:06:27 NOW
general 2021-06-06 03:06:37 :(
general 2021-06-06 03:06:44 k
general 2021-06-06 03:20:40 ping
general 2021-06-06 03:21:51 I really hope for Astrocraft to have pitch and yaw controls aside from gyro control
general 2021-06-06 03:22:55 weight is relative
general 2021-06-06 03:28:53 why a bike
general 2021-06-06 03:28:59 why not a scooter
general 2021-06-06 03:29:08 or roller blades
general 2021-06-06 03:29:12 or matchbox cars
general 2021-06-06 03:29:41 or perhaps that toy dumptruck you played with as a kid
general 2021-06-06 03:30:30 space banana
general 2021-06-06 03:30:38 yo
general 2021-06-06 03:31:47 maybe i could learn to use blender just to make a mesh of a vacuum sealed bag of dehydrated bananas
general 2021-06-06 03:32:01 cause like astrocraft
general 2021-06-06 03:32:13 help i might have found an addiction
general 2021-06-06 03:33:24 how does one help
general 2021-06-06 03:33:27 how help

general 2021-06-08 03:25:15 Anyone who has been here for a while really can't deny it
general 2021-06-08 03:26:10 what
general 2021-06-08 03:26:44 I leave the geographic region
general 2021-06-08 03:27:44 nah I am going star diving
general 2021-06-08 03:30:24 No I am going alone. Also my ship's computer can read the stability of a star's core so I will not be going near an unstable star
general 2021-06-08 03:31:26 what is the what?
general 2021-06-08 03:32:09 he doing a big fall

general 2021-06-08 03:39:14 **P U P P Y   ON   C E N T A U R O**
general 2021-06-08 03:39:54 bruh calm

general 2021-06-08 03:41:36 Also warships in general
general 2021-06-08 03:42:50 no
general 2021-06-08 03:43:27 I dont even know what that means
general 2021-06-08 03:43:44 I wanna know what that means cause it is bad
general 2021-06-08 03:47:45 uuuh what
general 2021-06-08 03:48:12 wut
general 2021-06-08 03:48:55 That is not how that works
general 2021-06-08 03:52:30 Make sure it is a chemical fire so much harder to put out
general 2021-06-08 03:52:45 WOAH
general 2021-06-08 03:52:56 Oof
general 2021-06-08 03:57:15 Even if it was not used in a negative context, it is still banned. Even by law in some cases
general 2021-06-08 14:56:46 practice practice practice
general 2021-06-08 15:00:55 <@!315262125113081856> How does one build two professional looking ships in astrocraft in less than a weeks time
general 2021-06-08 15:01:11 And those ships being their first two
general 2021-06-08 15:02:43 It is impressive tbh
general 2021-06-08 16:46:24 you can literally get warned for anything
general 2021-06-08 19:58:33 commands
general 2021-06-08 20:00:11 It took me about half a year to figure out what the windows button was after getting my laptop
general 2021-06-08 20:00:36 2 part update
general 2021-06-08 20:01:07 you dont pay for update so not scam
general 2021-06-08 20:01:24 however all the blocks shpuld be present
general 2021-06-08 20:01:41 yes but not for the updates
general 2021-06-08 20:01:59 if ypu buy a game to experience updates then you need some new brain cells
general 2021-06-08 20:03:25 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-06-08 20:06:18 rgbs are pointless
general 2021-06-08 21:16:05 well established fact
general 2021-06-08 21:17:20 Incoming list your source repsonse
general 2021-06-08 21:18:42 Depends on the furry tbh
general 2021-06-08 21:19:42 Because most of the people here hate pointlessly thinking it is funny
general 2021-06-08 21:20:54 Until you hate on the wrong person and you either ruin their life, or they end up ruining your life
general 2021-06-08 21:21:57 I unfortunately can relate
general 2021-06-08 21:22:41 They can choose to be nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 21:26:14 Langley
general 2021-06-08 21:58:41 basically people here
general 2021-06-08 22:01:33 Yes but I naturally have to confirm it even if no confirmation is needed. Especially since people need to realize this issue so if more people agree then maybe, just maybe, we will see less of this.
general 2021-06-08 22:02:53 Yet this server grows rapidly, and bullying is simply a bad thing to do
general 2021-06-08 22:04:26 Obvious or not, people will continue doing it unless called out on it
general 2021-06-09 02:39:16 Is it connect to the pilot seat?
general 2021-06-09 02:39:31 Do you have enough power?
general 2021-06-09 02:39:52 Then you need to put down a reactor
general 2021-06-09 02:40:41 Oh hey its fkonsk
general 2021-06-09 02:40:50 nice
general 2021-06-09 02:41:47 why
general 2021-06-09 02:42:07 why so high
general 2021-06-09 02:42:34 okay but what was the point
general 2021-06-09 02:43:51 No, but I hate it when I managed to build something backwards
general 2021-06-09 02:44:20 Build a Boat for Treasure
general 2021-06-09 02:46:08 I swear every 10 minutes we have someone random asking someone random if they are an unde
general 2021-06-09 02:49:13 I know all my online friends are not adults but that is as far as age knowledge goes
general 2021-06-09 02:50:36 not necessarily
general 2021-06-09 02:51:48 There are good ways to die. Also being immortal would be way worse as you are born to witness everything else die
general 2021-06-09 02:54:50 If you cannot afford nuts something is very wrong
general 2021-06-09 02:58:27 G
general 2021-06-09 03:00:00 oooh tricky
general 2021-06-09 03:00:38 okay F
general 2021-06-09 03:03:27 Not worth the effort most the time
general 2021-06-09 03:04:35 That was actually pretty quick
general 2021-06-09 03:05:34 <#504718138399522832> special
general 2021-06-09 03:06:18 I wanna play Astrocrazy
general 2021-06-09 03:07:08 probably one of the only fonkl moments ypu have experienced
general 2021-06-09 03:07:54 ngl I want to
general 2021-06-09 03:08:43 No I know what I am going to fly in
general 2021-06-09 03:08:54 So I am not bound to silly mars
general 2021-06-09 03:09:22 The only problem is it would quite literally take a month to charge
general 2021-06-09 21:25:55 Figured out how to mobile device
general 2021-06-09 21:38:17 If you can take over South America you are guaranteed a world superpower
general 2021-06-09 21:38:45 even on public servers I have been able to become twice as powerful as the world combined
general 2021-06-10 01:48:39 no
general 2021-06-10 01:49:17 yeah rick does that
general 2021-06-10 20:02:58 Bruh roblox crashed in the middle of me taking over Europe
general 2021-06-10 20:04:32 Also I learned playing Serbia will be like giving a feral cat a bath
general 2021-06-10 20:05:25 So much corruption and other not fun political shenanigans
general 2021-06-10 20:06:22 Also in case you have no idea what I am talking about, it do be Rise of Nations
general 2021-06-10 20:07:38 So glad they added mobile support
general 2021-06-10 20:08:04 I have something entertaining to do for the month while I has no computer
general 2021-06-11 20:30:15 You getting the same recommendations as me it seems
general 2021-06-11 20:30:41 The building tycoons are the best
general 2021-06-11 20:31:52 Miners Haven, Theme Park Tycoon, Retail Tycoon, Lumber Tycoon, Restaurant Tycoon, Itty Bitty Airport, Cruise Ship Tycoon
general 2021-06-11 20:31:56 they good
general 2021-06-11 20:32:53 I decided to play today and these two 5 year olds were going at each other like two women over a guy
general 2021-06-11 20:33:44 what is rendering
general 2021-06-11 20:34:45 Overbuilt aircraft
general 2021-06-11 20:35:13 Just about everyone has some attempt at an F14
general 2021-06-11 20:36:12 right I dont get scary, but protected?
general 2021-06-11 20:36:36 how?
general 2021-06-11 20:37:01 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2021-06-11 20:41:18 68 for supersonic
general 2021-06-11 20:44:21 When logging into steam, which account name do I put in?
general 2021-06-11 20:44:54 No seriously
general 2021-06-11 20:44:57 I need to know
general 2021-06-11 20:45:10 Cause everyone sees my profile name
general 2021-06-11 20:45:34 but I still find instances of my original account name
general 2021-06-11 20:46:25 So I am confused
general 2021-06-11 20:46:43 arcade
general 2021-06-11 20:47:22 how did you catch the moment when the game said you had one crewmate left
general 2021-06-12 02:09:16 Yall are unfunny
general 2021-06-12 17:30:12 Super Bomb Survival
general 2021-06-12 17:30:35 ?
general 2021-06-13 01:14:18 *question mark*
general 2021-06-14 00:01:51 If you watch enough of anything everything else gets predictable
general 2021-06-14 00:04:26 No?
general 2021-06-14 00:07:47 I have 6
general 2021-06-14 00:08:30 Huge waste of time
general 2021-06-14 00:11:20 english check?
general 2021-06-14 00:15:09 Every time someone sends a message discord keeps thinking i am not focused on the app and so the new message thing keeps popping up
general 2021-06-14 00:15:18 and it is genuinely getting annoying
general 2021-06-14 00:15:42 Jameson is not a furry
general 2021-06-14 00:18:22 I spent 100,000 robux for this ad 😭 plz click 🤗
general 2021-06-15 02:43:01 
general 2021-06-15 02:44:36 You can see where the mountains block the light
general 2021-06-15 02:58:19 and french battleships bow on will bounce asteroids
general 2021-06-15 03:00:46 no context
general 2021-06-15 03:05:03 its a link
general 2021-06-15 03:05:19 nothing interesting
general 2021-06-15 03:06:01 links are not at all interesting
general 2021-06-15 03:06:31 it is just a complex string of symbols that define the location of something on the internet
general 2021-06-15 03:06:54 like coordinates
general 2021-06-15 03:07:35 imagine having fur
general 2021-06-15 03:07:57 reject fur embrace hair
general 2021-06-15 03:09:40 ping
general 2021-06-15 03:11:23 quiet you are not getting pinged
general 2021-06-15 03:12:36 ***ENGLISH ONLY*** -some moderator
general 2021-06-15 03:13:59 why did the fake undes awaken
general 2021-06-15 03:17:13 Can you actually identify an unde in this environment anymore?
general 2021-06-15 03:20:56 Yeah how do you identify an unde when you have this pointless chaos?
general 2021-06-15 03:33:32 I have not even been able to install the game
general 2021-06-15 03:33:55 wdym
general 2021-06-15 03:35:40 The chaos that was occurring at the time of the message
general 2021-06-15 03:36:26 THATS THE ISSUE
general 2021-06-15 03:37:02 No my mom is too epic for anyone here
general 2021-06-15 03:37:37 Nope
general 2021-06-15 03:38:26 I am going to say no, I am not wrong
general 2021-06-15 03:39:02 No, I am not wrong
general 2021-06-15 03:45:19 Imagine having the money for that
general 2021-06-15 20:07:15 Rhode Island
general 2021-06-15 20:08:02 Inefficient too
general 2021-06-15 22:18:54 Okay?
general 2021-06-15 22:19:36 Oh-k
general 2021-06-15 22:20:53 Is there a correct way to spell "ok" or is it down to personal preference
general 2021-06-15 22:21:05 English class never teaches this
general 2021-06-15 22:22:22 there is no one in jet stream
general 2021-06-15 22:22:40 kek
general 2021-06-20 04:15:13 I guess I can be happy this place does not change
general 2021-06-20 04:18:47 Nevermind
general 2021-06-20 04:19:48 I really wish I could
general 2021-06-21 21:00:51 with nvidia card
general 2021-06-21 21:01:55 because no one wants to pay for road repairs
general 2021-06-21 21:02:26 and no one wants to pay for repairs
general 2021-06-21 21:02:34 you break it
general 2021-06-21 21:02:37 no one buys it
general 2021-06-21 21:04:40 yes but that is only two examples out of who knows how many streets
general 2021-06-21 21:06:04 that is by design
general 2021-06-21 21:07:45 Look at paved roads not cobble streets
general 2021-06-24 20:56:16 And now I go somewhere else
general 2021-06-24 21:02:00 I don't see the profile thing
general 2021-06-24 21:06:58 yes
general 2021-06-27 00:21:24 Activity means nothing with the mods
general 2021-06-27 00:21:48 They all could be watching chat
general 2021-06-27 00:22:47 It might take a couple of days
general 2021-06-27 00:23:48 The only time I did a rank request wuth the ticket system literally took hours
general 2021-06-28 17:59:43 Yo when did obc get promoted to community manager?
general 2021-06-28 18:01:44 Aye obc congrats on community manager
general 2021-06-28 18:03:51 Outrageous Builders Club
general 2021-06-28 18:08:58 Stealth bans?
general 2021-06-28 19:33:08 No it had been Pain Crazy Community for a while
general 2021-06-28 19:36:14 I am pretty much unable to attend the funeral service outside of the vc stuff
general 2021-06-28 19:37:21 Voxel left?
general 2021-06-28 19:38:55 I know that but someone was saying he actually left and I am too lazy to check
general 2021-06-28 19:39:34 hi
general 2021-06-28 19:40:29 someone who likes funerals I guess
general 2021-06-28 19:41:34 It was already pretty active every time I check
general 2021-06-28 19:42:13 PCC
general 2021-06-28 19:43:14 Leon left 😔
general 2021-06-28 19:50:47 Voxel retired
general 2021-06-28 19:52:51 This strange being that formed this server and kept it it stable*
general 2021-06-28 19:56:37 Did Voxel's funeral involve an Airforce fly over cause there are a lot of jets flying around
general 2021-06-28 19:58:21 Also Candy I didn't mean to reply. I did a funny misclick (misclick? How does one misclick on a mobile device? Mistouch?)
general 2021-06-28 19:59:31 Cause it is epic for epic person
general 2021-06-28 20:00:36 I wanna retire
general 2021-06-28 20:01:09 Yeah true
general 2021-06-28 20:03:29 I swear every time I wear a white shirt I manage to spill something on it that I didn't even have. Like there is a light red substance in my shirt. I had not had anything red today. Except beef which is a red meat, but it was cooked so no red liquid to stain.
general 2021-06-28 20:04:09 Bruh
general 2021-06-28 20:05:25 It is literally just a centimeter sized circle that is much to light to be box blood
general 2021-06-28 20:06:10 Me (no please don't I am joking)
general 2021-06-28 20:11:21 I feel like being mod on this server might be worse seeing how many people like to stretch the rules knowing that someone will react
general 2021-06-28 20:13:50 Who is Voxel?
general 2021-06-28 20:16:31 Nothing
general 2021-06-28 20:18:24 ~~ranked only chat~~
general 2021-06-28 20:19:31 For all the new people, VoxelBox = Community Manager and Founder. Now retired and big sad
general 2021-06-28 20:20:23 No clue
general 2021-06-28 20:21:39 I don't like who did the Up theme
general 2021-06-28 20:22:15 Same but only cause of that movie
general 2021-06-28 20:23:12 Someone did it for you
general 2021-06-28 20:24:14 Fonkl immortal
general 2021-06-28 20:25:54 Someone now needs to set up a schedule of all the staff funerals
general 2021-06-28 20:26:38 imagine if rick disappeared though
general 2021-06-28 20:27:51 Maybe. I honestly did not remember he existed until this debacle and I will likely forget in a week
general 2021-06-28 20:28:59 Imagine being so inactive that no one realizes that some random person is admin
general 2021-06-28 20:31:43 Dang it
general 2021-06-28 20:32:06 ~~10 second alowmode incoming ~~
general 2021-06-28 20:32:52 What is the maximum slowmode?
general 2021-06-28 20:36:11 imagine having numbers in your name
general 2021-06-28 20:36:55 No why did you point that out. Now people will start using red
general 2021-06-28 20:38:50 Wait but which tone?
general 2021-06-28 20:40:04 Make sure severe dehydration color is an option
general 2021-06-28 20:43:28 I have this office chair that seems like something you would fine in an old mansion but left out on the curb with a "free" sign taped to it
general 2021-06-28 20:44:41 no
general 2021-06-28 20:45:42 Wait which one?
general 2021-06-28 20:46:17 uuuh
general 2021-06-28 20:47:10 Oh yeah the funny planet... wait... moon? Uuhm, with a days that don't seem to work because of that big blue gas giant
general 2021-06-28 20:47:57 Basically humans in a nutshell
general 2021-06-29 01:29:10 Today
general 2021-06-29 04:48:40 Pretty sure I seen him speak once
general 2021-06-29 04:50:33 Or plutonium, or thorium
general 2021-06-29 04:51:12 preferably plutonium in large quantities
general 2021-06-29 19:30:53 Solid pepsi when
general 2021-06-29 19:31:58 Bose Einstein Condensate Pepsi even better
general 2021-06-29 19:33:09 The pepsi gets literally everywhere though
general 2021-06-29 19:33:53 Plasma pepsi messy
general 2021-06-29 19:34:38 Oh no
general 2021-06-29 19:36:53 Since when did anyone remember he existed?
general 2021-06-29 19:39:04 Moist paper towel
general 2021-06-29 19:39:08 what
general 2021-06-29 19:41:11 Can't one just take a pic of a random cheezit and post it in general?
general 2021-06-29 19:41:55 Without the context of it being a meme, how can it be a meme?
general 2021-06-29 19:42:25 Like how nik randomly posted a bag of microwave popcorn
general 2021-06-29 19:43:14 You posted under the context of a meme though
general 2021-06-29 19:43:22 So of course it will get deleted
general 2021-06-29 19:44:52 Popcorn still exists
general 2021-06-29 19:47:22 Random F-16 flyover
general 2021-06-29 19:47:44 I have heard that so many times
general 2021-06-29 19:48:10 But chocolate most the time is fake
general 2021-06-29 19:48:35 Dark chocolate has the most cocoa
general 2021-06-29 19:50:17 brotip?
general 2021-06-29 19:55:24 Yikes
general 2021-06-29 19:57:37 I literally confused April with August
general 2021-06-29 19:58:48 yes
general 2021-06-29 19:59:29 Hello
general 2021-06-29 19:59:48 I am doing well
general 2021-06-29 20:00:00 How has your day been?
general 2021-06-29 20:01:59 happy?
general 2021-06-29 20:04:52 There was this one case where someone who was supposedly a roblox moderator who said that they had to meet a certain number of warns, bans, and terminations. There is little to back this up and the person saying this is unknown.
general 2021-06-29 20:05:01 So it may be true, it may not be.
general 2021-06-29 20:05:51 I legit have had only one warn and that was when I was a salty 12 yo
general 2021-06-29 20:06:27 No surprises there
general 2021-06-29 20:07:20 Make a new account
general 2021-06-29 20:07:27 and make like 10 other accounts
general 2021-06-29 20:08:17 Cannot really do anything
general 2021-06-29 20:08:30 Did you appeal the ban?
general 2021-06-29 20:09:00 Not you
general 2021-06-29 20:10:46 Roblox moderation is pretty effective, but it gets way to many people that did nothing wrong (or at least anything notable)
general 2021-06-29 20:13:07 No there was a legitimate scam case, but it was items that broke ToS being put up to farm cahs and being later taken down providing no refunds to those that bought it.
general 2021-06-29 20:14:22 There was also a case about copyright songs on roblox, however this was a case that roblox would win since other people upload the music, not roblox.
general 2021-06-29 20:14:47 Yeah Beamng
general 2021-06-29 20:15:42 Overmoderation case.
general 2021-06-29 20:16:40 You literally did not let anyone answer
general 2021-06-29 20:18:00 Roblox reports
general 2021-06-29 20:21:00 Its 70 here why are you all burning?
general 2021-06-29 20:23:04 Has anyone seen those videos where people eat progressively spicier foods?
general 2021-06-29 20:23:58 I hit enter halfway through typing
general 2021-06-29 20:26:08 Why is duolingo in a space suit?
general 2021-06-29 20:27:05 Get off that graphics setting now
general 2021-06-29 20:28:16 How do you get ranks?
general 2021-06-29 20:28:19 Nope
general 2021-06-29 20:28:28 Hah no ranks for anyone
general 2021-06-29 20:31:03 oh my something is happening
general 2021-06-29 20:33:40 There should be a special ban that mutes someone in all channels but <#495286269459300364> just to reinforce no memes outside of that channel (obviously excluding memes relevant to a conversation)
general 2021-06-29 20:34:02 Sort of like the infinite mute
general 2021-06-29 20:34:32 I never send crash reports
general 2021-06-29 20:39:17 Screenshot?
general 2021-06-29 20:40:34 Why not today?
general 2021-06-29 20:41:05 It will take a couple of seconds to take and send a screenshot
general 2021-06-29 20:42:53 what
general 2021-06-29 20:44:01 I am not using a PC right now
general 2021-06-29 20:48:08 Okay somone is full on drag racing down the road
general 2021-06-29 20:48:41 Man I love the country side
general 2021-06-29 20:49:40 If I move to a city it will likely end up being Amsterdam
general 2021-06-29 20:49:44 So few cars
general 2021-06-29 20:50:35 I will either continue living out in the country, or I will just move across the Atlantic to Amsterdam
general 2021-06-29 20:51:04 I simply do not like how much noise makes up American cities
general 2021-06-29 20:56:46 A squid?
general 2021-06-29 20:57:46 It was Jailbreakius
general 2021-06-29 20:57:49 He
general 2021-06-29 20:57:50 was
general 2021-06-29 20:58:09 as close to being dead as one can get
general 2021-06-29 20:58:26 Level 100 inactivity
general 2021-06-29 21:01:25 who got automodded?
general 2021-06-29 21:01:42 Yeah that looked like a weeb
general 2021-06-29 21:01:55 It was you
general 2021-06-29 21:02:05 👀
general 2021-06-30 20:58:41 yeah
general 2021-06-30 20:59:32 I prefer infantry fighting vehicles personally
general 2021-06-30 21:00:44 *radial aircraft engines intensity*
general 2021-06-30 23:51:50 Yeah
general 2021-06-30 23:52:08 Win + shift + s actually allows cropped screenshots
general 2021-07-06 03:04:53 Too much effort to care
general 2021-07-06 03:06:00 I legit do not remember when I last played
general 2021-07-06 03:06:13 I know what I was last doing though
general 2021-07-06 03:11:12 If I had a dime for every oligone joke
general 2021-07-06 03:11:51 I could probably buy me a kitkat bar
general 2021-07-06 03:13:24 That ostwind makes me feel weird
general 2021-07-06 03:14:58 I am not getting Tiger 2 vibes from that Tiger 2
general 2021-07-06 03:15:26 what the
general 2021-07-06 03:17:27 At least for meme builds
general 2021-07-06 03:17:59 I got lucky with my expert designer
general 2021-07-06 03:18:15 Barely made required upvotes
general 2021-07-06 03:20:07 what
general 2021-07-06 03:20:31 Yet he landed 23
general 2021-07-12 19:33:41 Hmmmm
general 2021-07-12 19:47:50 <@!527653676022628353> hello obama
general 2021-07-12 19:49:14 We are in the same game
general 2021-07-13 22:23:09 
general 2021-07-13 22:33:36 The far right where my first domes, the far left was later game, and the trigon was because I had little space to place much needed farms
general 2021-07-13 22:36:20 I just got the game very recently so I am doing the best I can
general 2021-07-14 16:09:57 Wait who has that opinion?
general 2021-07-14 16:10:17 US or Indonesia?
general 2021-07-14 16:10:36 Haha so funny so original
general 2021-07-14 16:11:03 I mean something like that would hold a lot of sentimental value
general 2021-07-14 16:11:04 like

general 2021-07-14 16:17:53 How can I be a Westerner if I am east of the Mississippi
general 2021-07-14 16:18:34 Yes
general 2021-07-14 16:18:53 Okay but all states are weird
general 2021-07-14 16:19:02 Or are you talking about the western world?
general 2021-07-14 16:20:11 Are you talking westerner over the context of the world or the US
general 2021-07-14 16:20:23 Oh
general 2021-07-14 16:20:40 Once again stupid American English not applying to the rest of the world
general 2021-07-14 16:21:33 Nice spelling
general 2021-07-14 16:23:29 <#497142796961054721> is more energy efficient
general 2021-07-15 12:42:09 Overslept?

general 2021-07-21 21:26:47 Shush I cannot hit half of the keys I try to hit and so have to retype
general 2021-07-21 21:28:00 I have not played War Thunder in legit 2 months now
general 2021-07-21 21:28:36 With premium time or no?

general 2021-07-21 21:31:41 And I have used none of them
general 2021-07-21 21:32:01 Even the test drives of some really good vehicles
general 2021-07-28 20:22:32 Wait which mod is online?
general 2021-07-28 20:22:59 Someone just Dm'ed me from here asking if I wanted to see NSFW
general 2021-07-28 20:23:24 <@!708847655605895209>
general 2021-08-03 19:41:39 <:SoonTM:501066468629413916>
general 2021-08-03 19:43:29 hover thing?
general 2021-08-03 19:44:19 Odd
general 2021-08-16 17:39:13 pvp servers probably
general 2021-08-16 17:39:18 Always something happening
general 2021-08-16 17:39:24 You will loose sanity though
general 2021-08-17 15:29:36 Yeah lol
general 2021-08-17 15:53:18 Mikoyan-Gurevich
general 2021-08-19 21:34:13 Yeah no. PC and AC are very different
general 2021-08-19 21:35:16 Hard to read a joke unless it is obvious. Especially with some things people say here
general 2021-08-27 17:27:33 which one
general 2021-09-05 01:58:48 I have come here just to randomly say you all have skill issues and need to get good
general 2021-09-14 18:30:23 Oh no. Positivity
general 2021-09-14 18:32:23 No a few mods have had bans
general 2021-09-14 18:32:38 It's more of what you have been banned for
general 2021-09-14 18:35:28 Until you randomly ping the wrong person
general 2021-09-14 18:36:33 Bruh
general 2021-09-14 18:36:42 What
general 2021-09-14 18:37:51 Would a round earth be flat relative to gravity though?
general 2021-09-14 18:38:52 Would a cube be flat?
general 2021-09-14 18:39:33 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2021-09-14 18:40:16 Yeah we all know the Earth is fake
general 2021-09-14 18:41:03 Not real
general 2021-09-14 18:42:02 It's this round celestial ecosystem I guess. no idea what that is
general 2021-09-14 18:42:13 Some say it's flat too
general 2021-09-14 18:43:04 There are many guesses to what it is
general 2021-09-14 18:43:16 But a round planet is the most common one
general 2021-09-18 00:27:35 Is this a trend you noticed among the banned
general 2021-09-18 00:28:33 Oh yeah 224 was a shocker
general 2021-09-18 00:30:15 Sounds more like a European thing. cars suck so I can half agree with a car ban
general 2021-09-18 00:33:05 Cars as a whole should not be banned. However there are places that benefit from infrastructure rebuilds that don't benefit cars
general 2021-09-18 00:33:32 Or quickly decelerating
general 2021-09-18 00:34:53 I mean like almost everyone acts many years younger then they are so I agree
general 2021-09-18 00:35:16 Probably been a lot of jojos
general 2021-09-18 00:36:38 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
general 2021-09-18 00:36:46 2A6 better
general 2021-09-18 00:36:53 But wait until November
general 2021-09-18 00:37:09 Everything becomes half off
general 2021-09-18 00:38:26 Basically <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2021-09-18 00:41:28 Just be nice
general 2021-09-18 00:41:46 Nice is chad
general 2021-09-18 03:14:25 How is homework reliable?
general 2021-09-18 03:15:08 I don't find it odd
general 2021-09-18 03:15:45 Bruh
general 2021-09-18 03:17:24 Neat. Did he leave me anything?
general 2021-09-18 03:18:10 My phone was somehow 50 dollars
general 2021-09-18 03:19:24 Moto E. So an average smart phone
general 2021-09-18 03:32:35 I really don't know tbh
general 2021-09-18 03:34:36 Neat I was undee until like a week ago
general 2021-09-18 03:36:44 You kinda get used to it <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
general 2021-09-18 03:37:40 Looked more you like you Robert doing that
general 2021-09-18 03:39:04 Rip a lot of people
general 2021-09-18 03:39:57 Correction: 6
general 2021-09-18 03:42:54 Wait, didn't warns expire after a month?
general 2021-09-23 00:59:42 13+
general 2021-09-23 01:01:36 Yes but you can get in trouble if a mod catches you
general 2021-09-23 01:02:33 Seeing how some people act here it might not be fun
general 2021-09-23 01:04:55 Undes won't be able to use it, but anyone else can which is probably worse. Sure NSFW references will be thrown around
general 2021-09-23 01:05:38 Too many people don't deserve voice chat
general 2021-09-23 01:09:44 You have to ask, how many people can be trusted not to misuse it? Especially in a large game such a Plane Crazy?
general 2021-09-23 01:10:30 That makes it worse
general 2021-09-23 01:11:37 A teen or older playing a game made primarily for children
general 2021-09-23 01:12:46 That sounds stupid hard
general 2021-09-23 01:13:07 So many languages, so many accents, so many ways to skew words
general 2021-09-23 01:14:30 The only games I could see maybe having some good with VC's is stuff like Astrocraft until new players or factions get involved
general 2021-09-23 01:15:34 Likely hyperbot
general 2021-09-24 00:32:34 Okay 5 seconds of PCC was enough
general 2021-09-24 18:10:26 How is WT like with the event?
general 2021-10-04 22:11:01 Ye
general 2021-10-09 20:02:02 This is very true
general 2021-10-09 20:02:18 Except it likely isnt orange juice
general 2021-10-09 20:02:26 Rather just flavored chemicals
general 2021-10-20 19:46:53 That would be middle school, or junior high
general 2021-10-20 19:48:18 Honestly just a transitional thing
general 2021-10-20 19:48:53 English is hard
general 2021-10-20 19:49:55 Nat or Knat?
general 2021-10-20 19:50:04 What is the correct spelling of that word
general 2021-10-20 19:50:31 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
general 2021-10-20 19:50:55 I mean the insect
general 2021-10-20 19:52:32 How the heck are you a 13 yo in 9th grade
general 2021-10-20 19:53:34 6'1" or like 132 (+/-5) cm
general 2021-10-20 19:54:04 Hold on imma Google this
general 2021-10-20 19:54:35 I was way off
general 2021-10-20 19:54:46 Like 184cm
general 2021-10-20 19:55:21 Gonna take a while to learn metric with imperial hard wired into my head
general 2021-10-20 20:07:47 Sure everyone that knows war thunder knows about the upcoming update
general 2021-10-20 20:32:26 Mine won the war
general 2021-10-31 18:50:26 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-11-09 21:31:23 4 event pings <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-11-09 21:32:34 Outside the termination shock
general 2021-11-09 21:34:35 Why have women and grass when you have a cat and three coffee trees growing by you
general 2021-11-09 21:35:40 I live too far north for coffee trees to survive growing outside
general 2021-11-09 21:36:20 First of all what is he trying to say?
general 2021-11-29 18:54:49 Chicken 🐔
general 2021-12-01 22:41:31 Basically not liking alien species
general 2021-12-01 22:41:39 Indeed
general 2021-12-01 22:43:38 hah
general 2021-12-01 22:44:21 What about the other 10%?
general 2021-12-01 22:44:49 2 minute monthly visit up
general 2021-12-01 23:07:22 Astrocraft
general 2021-12-05 17:04:26 Ohio
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 03:22:30 Wind always exists
general 2021-12-14 15:14:24 Oh yeah
general 2021-12-14 15:14:52 I would love to live in an old European city
general 2021-12-14 15:16:23 But here is the question. Is the priority of building a street for cars or for people?
general 2021-12-14 15:17:11 Yeah. For your home city
general 2021-12-14 15:18:24 I live in a small American country town. So it has some character, but is otherwise boring
general 2021-12-14 15:19:30 Best snow in the world?
general 2021-12-14 15:19:46 Best snow in the world is no snow
general 2021-12-14 15:20:51 Snow is bad unless it comes and goes through the span of a lazy day
general 2021-12-14 15:22:09 Lived in Colorado for 4 years, North Dakota for 2, Wisconsin for 6. In those years I have learned that snow sucks
general 2021-12-18 23:34:18 Pretty sure he used a special oil that does that. Not a good idea considering the US exists
general 2021-12-21 18:11:01 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2021-12-21 18:12:21 That is a branch
general 2021-12-23 18:47:53 Social credits were a failed proposal by the Chinese government to essentially rank citizens on their actions to entice citizens to work harder for the nation and to punish anyone who does something wrong
general 2021-12-23 18:48:49 From what I heard it was a failed system
general 2021-12-23 18:49:00 Also I have heard nothing of it being used in Canada
general 2021-12-23 18:49:54 Funky
general 2021-12-24 17:11:12 The heck did you do
general 2021-12-29 22:30:45 A bit hopeful
general 2021-12-29 22:31:33 Wait how and from where
general 2021-12-30 02:56:24 Pretty sure no memes in general was an old rule
general 2022-01-02 03:47:22 Why am I still in this server
general 2022-01-02 03:47:22 Why am I still in this server
general 2022-01-02 16:31:08 Imagine ever getting payed for chores
general 2022-01-02 16:31:08 Imagine ever getting payed for chores
general 2022-01-05 19:13:48 Just report them
general 2022-01-05 19:14:20 What did they do?
general 2022-01-05 19:14:33 Fair
general 2022-01-05 19:19:32 My existence disproves it
general 2022-01-05 19:25:25 Impossible action
general 2022-01-05 19:26:34 It wasn't but it was useful enough to become a feature
the-dump 2022-01-05 19:32:37 Quality photo dump
general 2022-01-10 18:53:11 <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081>
general 2022-01-10 18:54:06 MyDolphinIsntWorking
general 2022-01-12 01:58:45 Probably not
general 2022-01-12 01:59:10 It takes a patient person to learn
general 2022-01-14 00:36:29 Yes
general 2022-02-07 03:23:39 Yeah no more PCC for me
general 2022-02-07 03:23:44 It was fun while it lasted
