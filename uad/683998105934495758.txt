plane-crazy 2020-12-29 15:27:42 Mayhaps it's the control panels going to your mouse cursor?
bug-reports 2021-02-13 11:20:25 I think they mean that their builds didn't get automatically saved when they left the game
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 11:20:54 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 11:21:07 Shredder bugs are powerful I can give em that
general 2021-02-13 11:31:58 a
general 2021-02-13 11:32:56 That's just wrong
the-dump 2021-02-13 11:54:14 Really?
It looks like a fish to me
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 11:55:31 Why not try making a tiny hover vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:27:12 Show me
creations-chat 2021-02-13 13:29:09 Mayhaps increase the ballast in the wheels part
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:33:10 X
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:34:03 OOF
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:34:15 I need to try that sometime
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:35:15 Isn't the point of pvp to be as op as possible ._  .
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:35:27 This is witchcraft!
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:38:49 XD
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:39:12 Magnets right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:40:24 I used 5 to make a sort of staff
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:41:09 It's not for pvp but it just looks nice with a sort of gem in the middle XD
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 13:47:14 Our soviet jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 14:58:23 Lol what the heck
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 14:58:48 Ahahahah
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 14:59:15 It's funny how younger chillins think pink is a girl's colour
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 14:59:34 I like purple with black but that doesn't make me a guy
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 03:39:56 Ohhhh I was about to say "Dude that's a snowblaster"

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:29:20 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:30:49 Hmm...

What would a smol turret on wheels which flies with the help of rocket engines and wings be classified as
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:31:22 Welp

I guess I made cancer
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:33:13 It can drive with its weirdly placed wheels

It can get a speed boost and a little help to take off and go up or down with super rockets

It can fly mainly due to its wings which don't fold or anything and have cutters at their edges

And it can dodge pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:33:51 It also has more kills then deaths and I've killed a few shredders so I'm concerned about it's power
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 15:35:09 I'm sorry my peasant brain doesn't understand these magic words
the-dump 2021-02-19 17:50:19 
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 17:53:37 You don't have image perms

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 17:55:26 Here's what <@560487315307495424>  wanted to send
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 17:55:44 Seems neat
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 17:56:02 Isn't it a ball landing gear

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 18:30:58 Don't ping me
Ping Luca
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:29:14 It's kinda sad how people get hate for their builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:30:15 It'd help the builders to progress if you give them constructive criticism instead of negative criticism
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:31:13 Can't help toxics who aren't up for understanding *shrug*
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:31:40 I'm not a weeb
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:32:16 Fine then I'll change my pfp if that's the case
I only thought it was cute *shrug*
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:33:35 <@621817208313479248> there
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:33:49 I can't find my egg with le leg
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:34:00 I'm gonna fricking find that and make it my pfp
bot-central 2021-02-20 12:34:35 Heh
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:35:37 Even better
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:36:36 Now...
"Fucking delete it" is just negative 
It doesn't really qualify as constructive
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:36:49 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
bug-reports 2021-02-20 12:38:45 I don't know why it does that noise ngl
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:40:15 Rick my dude I think you should make the body a little shorter and maybe add tank treads
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:41:08 Aaand maybe use wedges instead of cutters
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:43:54 Ye!
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:44:13 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:44:25 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:45:00 You've never given a useful tip in your life have you
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:46:30 If you can't give tips then you probably shouldn't give hate either
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:51:13 U
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 12:54:33 :)
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 13:07:14 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:21:15 Why not use a motor and extend it upwards
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:22:23 Use black purple and a somewhat purplish-blue
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:33:26 Make it lighter
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 19:33:40 I meant use black and purple both like to make a sort of pattern
the-dump 2021-02-20 19:39:23 Yeah imagine that
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 08:43:59 Some sort of exploit that lets them instantly copy your build I assume
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 08:50:04 I dunno how it was even made
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:09:36 I feel kinda bad for you Neutral
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:20:55 Because you just got "Insulted" so much lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:22:39 wha-
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:29:55 What the hell does a flying turret which can also work on ground classify as 0-0
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:31:00 Well then I have 3 different versions of nothing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:21:10 Wait is the engine inside its mouth or summin?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:22:34 So basically it eats and defecates air and that's how it moves
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:25:38 I  mean... the anatomy is just perfect for it XD
