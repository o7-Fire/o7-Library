plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:33:53 I have a cursed Stuka you guys wanna see?
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:34:25 What I meant by curse, it's not like it's a bad build, just bad design
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:39:18 Fictional plane, called the JA-34 Rughart, a cursed version of a Stuka
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:39:36 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:39:49 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:40:49 The middle
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:41:07 It's a small propeller in the bottom middle part of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:41:18 That's what makes it cursed
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:41:47 Justa dumb idea that I thought
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 12:42:20 I figure ill get downvoted if I post this in <#384025409945337856>  lol

creations-chat 2021-10-11 14:42:22 It's cool
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 14:46:06 Something is wrong with my nashorn, idk I just feel like it

plane-crazy 2021-10-11 16:38:43 Btw look at this boi firing it's rocket
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 16:41:05 Not really, I made them myself
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 16:41:30 Like I design em myself, but I learnt it from my friends about motor locking rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 16:42:05 Well, I still need to fix them, since because they keep going the way I don't want them to go
general 2021-10-11 16:43:35 General? More like genreal

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:28:56 Somehow that looks easier than the dual rotors
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:29:06 Actaulllyyyy
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:29:18 Did someone already make the fa 223?

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:30:40 I should make the FA 223 but more detailed and smoother version of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:31:00 Still need to think about that chassis first
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:32:21 And thanks

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:37:00 Someone should make Ka'bah, and if people downvote on it, it will be haram
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 03:38:20 Same

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 09:09:39 Does any one of you know how to build a sliding door onto a helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 09:10:42 No?
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 09:10:55 nvrm I'll experiment it on myself
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 03:32:11 Currently I'm making the fa-223 and uh... I don't know what i'm doing ._.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 03:33:18 How's the sofa doin"?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 03:36:16 hMmhmmMmMmm
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:38:28 The gun on my Fa-223 looks weird, what should I do with it?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:41:25 Thanks for the tip 😄
creations-chat 2021-10-13 11:15:13 My FA-223 is going great, the thing that I'm scared is that it might not fly, plus I never made a helicopter before :v
creations-chat 2021-10-13 11:17:28 What do you think about the helicopter?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 11:20:21 I mean the tail section and the body is different :/
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 11:24:02 My friend beside my build  : D
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 11:24:24 It is
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 11:24:40 my friend just want a picture of her beside it
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 11:26:20 I never knew how to make a helicopter, worse how to make it fly lol
creations-chat 2021-10-13 12:19:15 I did, well for some part :/
creations-chat 2021-10-13 12:36:15 Oooo, very satisfying to watch :D
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:16:16 So I try to test a double rotor helicopter with the blades and uh...
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:16:53 What does wobbling means? Is it like there is something that isn't strong enough to support it? Or is it just the blades
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:41:44 MY HELICOPTER KEEPS WOBBLING
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:44:08 I knew it, my helicopter is uh... how do I say this, skinless?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:44:19 idk if that affects it
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:45:15 <@!310133243028570122>
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:45:38 That was the lates pic before I build the helicopter blades
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:46:00 Okay but the problem is why is it wobling?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:47:37 Does rockets propelled rotor affect weight distribution?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:49:09 Last time I check it was balanced, well I mean symetrical
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:49:20 wdym by that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:50:39 That's the problem.. I don't think it can extend beyond the nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:50:56 Uh...
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:51:27 It's quite far from the nose, and if I extend it more the blades will hit each other
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:51:34 Hold on lemme get a pic
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:52:16 Wait nvrm, the nose is shorter
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:52:29 Maybe it was the rockets placement?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:53:04 I did put like more than 10 blocks for the lenght of the rotor blades
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:54:16 shut up
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:54:19 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:55:04 so your saying that it's better to put rockets on the tip only?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:56:10 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:56:30 But from my last experiment there was alot of issues
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:57:14 First is ofcourse the wobbling, second the tail weights like a ton
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:57:22 I did
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:57:31 Plus  I don't want to use helium
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:57:52 i know
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:58:21 Oh yeah one more thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 15:59:06 The helicopter must be a three blade rotor, does that affect the helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:00:12 bruh, i put like 10 in the front yet the tails want to go backwards
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:00:57 I should've built a simple helicopter, the fact that this is my first ever helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:01:02 I DID
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:01:07 MAXIMUM
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:02:11 but
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:02:20 if you put 4 blocks is the same ._.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:03:08 Again, does 3 blades affect the helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:03:25 Like 3 blades in one rotor
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:03:33 What do you call it again?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:03:54 oh its just... 3 blades?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:03:58 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:04:02 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:04:55 wait is tail rotor neccessary?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:05:29 Uh, but the uh....
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:06:05 alright so... uh... about that...
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:07:10 But i don't get it, how does this fly well without a tail rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:07:42 huh
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:08:06 Well luckily I did install that vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:08:13 I meant horizontal
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:09:09 Dammit, I built a new rotor and tested it on my helicopter yet it does it again, it still wobbles
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:09:57 if the blades are long as hell, the helicopter wobbles right??
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:10:58 Jeez I should've built a simple helicopter first ._.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:12:21 Here is another picture of the helicopter, ignore my friend
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:12:50 Welp, I'm gonna make it one more time, because I've spent alllll day long on the goddamn rotors
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:13:13 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:13:26 The gun doesnt count as the nose right?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 16:50:17 <@!310133243028570122> The plane kinda wobbles, but fly straight thank god, <@!632942443536318494> Thank you so much for recommending the ballast tank, my plane is now front heavy,I thank to the both of you, now I can rest 😄

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:21:09 Look at my boi go :D
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:23:57 I know, the problem is the rack glitches if I put it up and backwards
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:24:13 It's just flaps
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:24:27 The rack is too long for the motor to handle
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:24:48 What's bad?

creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:30:27 I tried, the only thing close is a 1x1 wheel which looks too weird, and too small, plus I still have some skill issues that I can't seem to do, I tried to use camera lock, angle lock and such stuff but things... didn't really work out
creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:35:30 wouldn't that make it the same?
creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:38:24 Okay but... how will it retract?
