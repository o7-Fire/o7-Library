general 2018-12-30 19:10:03 Wanna know what the game needs?
general 2018-12-30 19:10:23 A 2 mile air strip for making land speed vehicles
general 2018-12-30 19:12:48 I could only get my land speed vehicle to 330.
general 2018-12-30 19:13:03 That was with wings
general 2018-12-30 19:13:13 So it isn't a land speed vehicle anymore
general 2018-12-30 19:15:40 Do magnetic engines still lag the game out?

creations-chat 2019-02-19 01:28:36 a little bit of lag hurt no one
creations-chat 2019-02-19 01:29:36 without the spearhead wings it would be very unstable
creations-chat 2019-02-19 01:29:49 doesnt look bad imo
creations-chat 2019-02-19 02:37:01 when i made my plane i used twin enclosures for the engine bays
creations-chat 2019-02-19 02:37:14 so it looks
creations-chat 2019-02-19 02:37:17 well you know
the-dump 2019-02-19 07:34:43 
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 07:36:29 I tried to make a smaller version of this for more speed and less lag but if I remove the two engine bays, I can only put the rockets in the fuselage. How am I supposed to not ruin the looks
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 07:37:29 I could make a cargo version
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 07:37:36 It won't look like it was originally
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 07:38:09 Also, how can I get roles. Is submissions part of it?
general 2019-02-19 07:40:16 I wonder when the game will get a new map with a better base location. Because who wants to have limited space at the very edge of a small map?
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 07:41:14 I did, but I was skeptical on whether I should ask for ranks or not
general 2019-02-19 07:42:41 That evil smile
^
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 14:36:11 I'm more of a wing guy.
Perhaps one day the devs will add airfoils for better lift on bigger aircrafts
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 14:37:37 But will it blend?

plane-crazy 2019-03-14 02:20:27 tbh i think its best if i build a hybrid shuttle - plane from the top
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 02:21:19 basically it will be a shuttle but is also a plane. it will be inspired by my own fictional plane which i called The Kraken
creations-chat 2019-03-14 14:39:50 The Kraken (revised)
I don't have the part count with me since im not home but it's about 750 parts. What role can this give me? Top speed 450 with air brakes

plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:53:11 What canards
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:53:28 Wym canards
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:53:42 They balance the lift
plane-crazy 2019-03-14 19:54:57 I thought the canards were fine. They were much bigger until I gave it VTOL

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 23:37:57 Yo has anyone snorted solid oxygen
creations-chat 2019-03-27 08:23:24 Name: RY - C
Type: Low speed, maneuverable jet
Features: Funtions normally as intended, Basic front VTOL is used to help with takeoff, but only works at 60 speed
Description: This slightly ugly jet was made to be more maneuverable than stylish, the purpose of building this was to have a plane that can go at moderate speeds without rockets, since they are notorious for lagging.
Result: 200 speed, lightning fast movements, no screaming kids throwing their mom's crappy laptop out the window due to lag

plane-crazy 2019-03-28 08:29:13 the jet engines are only for lateral movements, and not up or down
creations-chat 2019-03-28 08:32:22 My first drone
Features: Lateral movements assisted with jet engines (only forward and back, tilts)
Functionality: Slow, heavy drone which may turn into a tiny fortress in the near future, will need to change motors out tho.

plane-crazy 2019-04-06 00:46:28 idk. some behemoth jet.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 00:46:57 i like designes of half enclosed engines. this inspires the design
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 00:52:32 I'm debating on calling it the WASP - 32B based on my previous designs. I've been going for this for awhile
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 00:52:51 Why did you even

plane-crazy 2019-04-06 02:28:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 02:28:14 Correct
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 02:29:36 keep in mind that the rear jet is by design, working on the front. the problem is that i cant lower the front ones. and adding half blocks will make it stick out. when can we get 1/4 blocks and beams?
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 02:35:32 i confronted the individual. calling for backup 10-4

creations-chat 2019-04-06 02:44:39 WASP - 32B
This is a jet rocket hybrid that is design to takeoff on water, kinda like a boat.
Open front engine design with a huge jet in the rear. if someone tells me its a batmobile i swear to ConConinos (dont ban)

Top speed: roughly 500 MPH

Very snappy controls.

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 13:05:48 I sometimes build tutorials, but I always tell people that it isn't my design and I use those builds for inspiration on other stuff.

Yeah I'm not original.

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 13:10:39 Coming up with something 100% yours will help you the most. sparingly using tutorials is fine, but depending on them won't help in the long run. Getting that noggin going will bring up your skill.

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 13:17:28 Anyway, I honestly regret deleting my very old first builds. I vaguely remember making my own rocket and my lord it was janky and it tried too hard on the design aspect. Didn't even fly correctly.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 13:19:20 Pro tip (jk, I'm an amateur): do not just think "I need to make this work", think about  "how does this work in real life, and how could it be done?".

Don't get yourself stuck, not everything is possible in plane crazy, but there's plenty of room for creativity as long as you don't rush yourself.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 13:20:33 Do this instead if you don't want a murder charge.

plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:24:11 recently completed this fairly basic quad prop plane. not based off anything, just went with it. it is powered only by the 4 4-speed motored propellors. top speed around 250 and flies well but a little floaty.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:24:35 hence why i said fairly basic
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:25:33 and this cute drone.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:26:49 yeah i admit, the vertical stabilizers are off-putting. for now i will keep it this way but i might change it up a bit later to be less cursed.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:27:40 90% of my builds were made when i was a complete noob, but my skills have gotten a little better so im going through them and making better versions.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:29:35 at some point i will definitely try some of the more advanced things. i understand motorlocking but so far i only used it in a tutorial.
