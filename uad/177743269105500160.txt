plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:05:10 My normal tank turret works smoothly
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:05:12 Tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:06:16

help 2020-03-13 04:11:40 And it keeps shaking
help 2020-03-13 04:11:40 I made an oscillating tank turret
help 2020-03-13 04:11:41 But it shakes a lot
help 2020-03-13 04:11:49 Normal tank turrets work fine
help 2020-03-13 04:11:57 I just have trouble with this one:/
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:20:28 Me when someone makes an Abrams tank and gets 30 upvotes: am I a joke to you??
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:20:35 😐😐
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:20:42 Abrams tanks are so easy to make lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:20:47 The turret is so simple
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:20:58 It's not rounded or anything
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:21:08 Just a bunch of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:29 Like take the is 4 for example
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:33 Super complex turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:41 But than you have modern tanks
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:45 Like the leopard
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:48 And abrams
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:28:51 Simple turrets
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:29:54 Wdym
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:29:57 It's easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:30:02 Just a bunch of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:30:17 Wedges :/
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:30:35 No where near as hard making a is-# line tank tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:20 If you're able to make a is-4 or is-7
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:26 You're a legend
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:40 But tanks like the
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:43 Abrams
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:53 And challenger 2
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:31:55 Easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:02 <@351848864531218442> so?
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:09 None of my tanks are modern lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:18 They're all based of cold war tanks
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:27 <@459749464434016266> yep
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:50 That's why people that make challengers and abrams get hella likes
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:53 Easy to make
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:32:55 And looks good
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:33:03 But if you have a rounded turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:33:04 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:33:07 No likes
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:33:41 Some kid made a t34
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:33:54 And they're simple :/
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:34:38 I'd love to see people make an is-# line tank
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:34:49 Even the hull is complex xD
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:36:16 Is 4 and 5 are more complex
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:36:37 A 2a7?
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:36:42 That's legit
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:36:46 The most simple tank
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:36:50 I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:37:56 I only make og tanks
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:07 Because it's a good design
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:31 Legit almost all modern tanks have the same design
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:36 No diversity
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:39 Yeah I get
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:44 It's more efficient
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:55 Wdym
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:38:56 Dude
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:39:07 Look at the 2a7, abrams and challenger 2
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:39:13 They're pretty similar
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:39:26 But then compare a tiger to a t34 and m4
plane-crazy 2020-03-13 04:40:20 I'm gonna make a t26e4

plane-crazy 2020-03-13 17:39:30 You have to put the main pilot seat in the right spot or else the turret shakes

plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:29:27 gg
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:29:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:29:39 its harder to do
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:30:05 bigger tanks allow you to add more detail
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:30:47 try making a f35 thats 3 by 6 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:31:11 you wouldnt even be able to tell its a f35
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:31:16 lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:31:33 when did i say that?
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:31:41 im just using it as an example
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:31:56 to prove its harder to detail small builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:32:44 large builds allow for more detail
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:33:30 this is getting out of control
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:33:57 empire your pershing is pretty good

plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:34:36 vipempire maybe if you read what i said
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:34:56 i said its hard to make a life sized t26e4
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:35:31 never said it's hard to make a bigger t26e4
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:35:50 just a life sized version that actually looks like the real thing
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:45:57 that moment when gun elevation and turning turrets don't matter
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 01:46:06 *dies*

plane-crazy 2020-03-14 06:52:00 the only difference between a FV215 B and a conqueror is the gun and hull lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 06:52:27 And spaced armor
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 06:52:34 
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 06:54:26 
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 06:54:30 Is there a hull difference?
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 07:24:41

plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:22:25 My FV215 B will never get the upvotes it deserves
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:22:40 Creations was flooded
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:22:56 And people don't like to scroll for hours
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:23:14 My first creation got 12 upvotes in 6 hours
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:23:44 It might be because people don't know what a FV215 B is
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:24:09 I'm just gonna make a FV214 Super Conqueror
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:25:45 Last night

plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:47:12 <@410164867165716507> is it the hull?
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:48:01 <@410164867165716507> I was gonna add detail later but okay
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:48:36 <@410164867165716507> let's just say it was just made in a factory
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:48:50 But I'm making a super conqueror later
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:48:57 I hate the hull is based it off
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:50:28 <@410164867165716507>
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:50:51 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:50:57 I like getting a full view
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:51:06 Hmm?
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 16:51:27 ^
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:03:27 I hate it when my turret blocks get welded together
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:04:27 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:04:33 That's dumb
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:05:46 They should add a none welding tool
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:05:55 I don't know how to explain it
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:06:16 <@351848864531218442> yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:06:27 No that's not what I mean
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:06:55 I was talking about the physics of ot
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:07:22 "Wouldn't non weldable blocks just fall off"
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:07:55 So what I'm saying is you should be able to click the two blocks you dont want to be welded
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:08:08 That way they're still welded to the rest of the build
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:08:11 And not eachother
plane-crazy 2020-03-14 17:08:47 <@163143541160148992> ye

bot-central 2020-03-27 10:41:36 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 10:42:17 How do you hold a quad fold together if the motors are destroyed?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 10:42:27 I'm using magnets but they're too laggy
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 10:43:53 <@659802570474258500>  wanna have a ship battle?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:05:57 battle ship i'm working on, 65% complete
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:06:20 what do y'all think about this turret?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:08:15 
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:08:50 front is too wide, working on it
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:10:41 The colors aren't finished btw
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:10:49 I know it's all grey
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:16:43 <@479273717609005059> no
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:16:44 But
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:16:52 How big are you making the ship?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:17:04 Is it a triple or quad fold
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:17:14 Eh
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:17:18 I would say it's fine
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:17:26 Half of it is underwater
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:17:36 But add more red
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:18:24 oh i see, you want it to be a straight line
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:18:48 i haven't finished mine yet but thi si how tall it is
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:20:25 Well mine is more complicated because my hull is too tall
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:21:26 folding is easier if you make the hull shorter
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:21:37 
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:21:44 
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:21:54 i had to fold one of the turrets
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:22:06 i wonder how im getting it to turn
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:22:33 yeah but its split in half
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 11:22:45 lol

plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:01:16 Then do that
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:01:25 It's not hard
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:01:29 It's just big
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:01:46 The guns on it are small so you don't have to worry about it getting to crowded
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:06:43 <@479273717609005059> well then make a ishizuchi
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:06:46 Its easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:06:55 Well not easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:06:59 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:07:09 Depends on how much effort you put into it
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:07:22 But that would make a great ship for you to build
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:07:30 It's on the smaller side too
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 16:07:31 It is

plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:08:20 <@340713981696016384> I've never had that problem before
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:08:33 Are they motor 2?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:09:05 Oh shit
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:09:11 I've had that problem before
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:09:17 With my t57 heavy
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:09:48 It happens when you use multiple motor 2 turrets that aren't keybinded
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:10:11 I don't know how to fix it tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:10:28 Only thing that helped was changing the position
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:10:36 Of the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:10:39 It's stupid
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:11:05 <@459749464434016266>  remember my t57 with the shaking turret?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:11:32 Try removing
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:11:43 The motor 2s
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:11:47 On the other turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:11:53 <@479273717609005059> send pictures
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:12:11 And replacing them with motor 1
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:12:19 If it's still happening
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:12:24 I don't know what to do
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:12:43 Ff
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:13:05 That's wrong
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:13:56 Make it like this
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:14:09 But backwards
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:14:45 Just add more blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:14:50 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:15:02 Use cameras
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:15:28 Just do it at the bottom of the ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:15:36 Its submerged anyway
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 17:16:04 Idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:24:24 Sad how this creation of mine has the most likes even tho it's easy to make
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:24:26 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:25:24 It got more than my a10, submarine and tank ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:52:15 I should've built a uss Iowa
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:52:22 Way easier than Montana
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:29 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:54:20 Ignore the paint
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:54:36 No shit
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:55:00 Way harder to make ships with 4+ guns
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:55:07 3 or 2 is easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:55:29 But I'm not trying to make my cannons smaller so I guess its staying like that
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:08 How is itbad?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:15 That part
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:18 I would agree on
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:30 But the guns and superstructure are nice

plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:47:54 What do yall think of my first build?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:54:02 It's a custom build
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:54:11 <@454570394343702529> wdym after ban?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:54:25 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:54:32 But that that's not new...
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:54:53 That was my first build when I started playing the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:55:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:56:03 Hi
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 02:56:07 Tank kid
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:21:39 <@510982364566913069> You got the turret in the front wrong
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:21:50 It doesn't have those view things on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:21:55 The rest do tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:22:23 ^
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:22:59 <@335599526414909451> let that part slide
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:23:43 <@510982364566913069>  idk about you
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:23:49 But you have the best build so far
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:24:11 Make your barrels 1-2 cylinders shorter
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:24:18 For your main guns
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:24:59 I should've made an iowa instead of trying to make a Montana
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:25:17 Iowa is way friendlier for new ship builds like me
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:25:38 <@335599526414909451> it has less armaments
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:25:53 Which gives you more space for the super structure
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:26:23 <@335599526414909451> nah would say ww1 battle ships
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:27:05 They're smol boys
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:27:20 <@335599526414909451> I wouldn't say that
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:27:33 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:27:37 It has smaller turrets
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:28:06 I've learned a lot from making my first ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:28:13 And that's to make shorter hulls
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:28:25 Mine was too tall so I had to fold the super structure into it
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:29:39 Dude
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:29:43 I legit had to fold
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:29:48 One of the cannons
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:29:52 Into 3 parts
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:29:59 <@335599526414909451> that wouldn't be a pain
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:30:35 Making an iowa or Montana is harder
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:31:02 Thing is
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:31:07 The guns are way bigger
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:31:31 Making them realistic does
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:31:45 Like this guys
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:31:49 His barrels are too big
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:32:03 But they have everything else good
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:32:25 They fr have to add
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:32:35 Different cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:32:41 I'm tired of how big they are
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:33:54 What do you think of this so far ? (First ship)(not finished)
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:34:32 <@335599526414909451> but I like it ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:34:40 I prefer it over vertical
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:35:28 That hull tho
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:35:59 They better be planning on adding bigger plots
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:36:16 Imagine
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:36:30 Imagine not being a new player like me :)
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:36:40 Why can't you be cool like us new players

plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:37:56 <@335599526414909451> only my bow uses horizontal
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:02 The rest is vertical
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:21 ^
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:27 That's why I used horizontal
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:30 For my bow
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:35 It's easier to curve
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:49 Also my hull isn't the the final design
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:38:57 I know it has a bunch of edges
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:39:36 <@454570394343702529> did it like get bombed?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:39:45 Or is it like that from something else
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:40:01 Just one?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:40:13 That's a lot of damage😳

plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:40:30 I need it for my submarine

plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:42:25 Just use
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:42:29 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:42:35 Just use magnets
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:42:44 To hold the ship together
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:42:49 After the motors are shot off
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:43:24 True
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:43:48 <@335599526414909451> too much edges
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:44:07 Mine is pretty edgy too
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:44:20 Someone needs to make a super
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:44:23 Smooth h
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:44:26 Hull design

plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:57:26 
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:57:45 It does
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:58:05 Its rounded in that part
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 00:58:16 I think they were talking about

plane-crazy 2020-03-30 07:59:30 Would mine be considered better or no?
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 07:59:35 Like without the camo
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:00:53 If I'm being honest
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:00 Whatfucks up my shit the most
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:03 Is the bridge
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:16 The shape was super limited because I had to fold it into the hull
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:27 And if I made to tall or wide it would get stuck
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:36 That's something I learned
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:01:55 Don't make your hull 15+ blocks tall :)
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 08:02:15 Or else you'll have no space for super structure

plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:00:42 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:00:46 Experience
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:00:53 I made a working turret
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:00:57 My first day
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:00:59 🤡
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:01:32 <@456226577798135808> here's a tip
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:01:36 Only use 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:04 Are you
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:05 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:08 You don't
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:20 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:37 But you don't need to change any setting
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:02:50 That way you can aim at whatever you're looking at
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:03:42 <@456226577798135808> so to make it you need a vertical facing motor 2 and a horizontal facing motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:04:06 The first motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:04:12 Will be a the turret ring
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:04:21 The second will be for the gun barrel
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:04:57 Gun barrel will have vertical movement
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:05:04 Turret ring will have horizontal
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:05:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:05:09 Like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:05:16 Bat add blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:05:19 To make it taller
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:06:25 <@456226577798135808> also the second motor doesn't have to be touching the first one
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:06:38 They do have to be connected through blocks tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:13:39 Make it 3x2.5x2.5 <@467459282250629120>
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:14:54 <@456226577798135808> I told you if the top motor is touching the bottom one it wont work as well
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:14:57 But whatever
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:15:58 I did
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 17:16:03 I think

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:52:34 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:52:43 Puri and I both made b-2s
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:52:50 It's kinda debatable
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:52:58 On who made the better b-2
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:53:34 His body is smoother
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:53:45 But his wings are supposed to be a bit longer
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:53:53 Let's just say
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:54:01 Puri's is a 10/10
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:54:03 Mine is
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:54:08 A 8.5/10
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:54:32 I once went at 9k speed and the wings glitched off
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 07:54:57 I know

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:37:11 Started playing
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:38:01 Well better question 
How long have you been playing ? <@221496030355521536>
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:38:19 .
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:38:38 I just got into my 10th day in game
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:38:40 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:39:41 I have 3 alts
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:39:48 Just had to add up the time
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:39:51 Easy
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:40:30 What about me ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:40:32 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:40:49 Well so far I'm on my 12th build
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:41:01 Ye
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:41:42 I don't like how people make over scaled builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:02 Like I've said before
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:07 It takes more skill
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:10 To detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:24 A smaller build
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:32 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:40 When did I say that
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:42:53 You don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:18 Imagine trying to detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:23 A 1x1 build
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:32 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:41 That wouldn't be overscaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:49 To me at least
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:00 It would be like
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:04 53 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:05 Wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:06 In game
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:30 Could you atleast let me fucking finish ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:38 You didn't even let me explain
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:55 What I think overscaled is
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:03 Let's say
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:20 Someone made a quad fold f22
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:30 That's like
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:35 5k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:42 That's what I mean by overscaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:21 I saw a f22 that had 6k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:28 Its was horrific
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:56 That's fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:09 Its horrific because it's big
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:15 Just imagine
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:20 A f22
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:27 The size of a quad fold battleship
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:58 Eee
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:48:48 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:48:51 😎

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:06:41 Looks more like a bullet
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:13 <@287779983445721088> wdym
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:25 None of my subs look like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:27 Lmfao
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:51 Then why say it looks like that?

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:11:03 How is this crap?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:11:10 It was like my 5th build
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:12:52 They aren't modern subs tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:15:31 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:15:45 You can't compare a modern sub
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:15:51 To old age subs
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:16:03 Modern subs are legit sausages
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:16:07 Which
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:16:15 Are annoying to detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:16:22 Because you can't
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:17:31 Imagine trying detail this
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:17:34 
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:17:37 🤡
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:17:55 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:03 You cant detail a fucking sausage
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:16 
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:20 This however
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:23 You can detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:29 No modern sub
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:33 Is ever gonna get
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:34 Hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:18:49 Because they dont need them
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:19:10 Subs aren't supposed surface
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:19:17 Or else they'll be useless
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:19:25 They're meant for stealth
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:19:32 They only surface at bases
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:19:39 Or safe spots
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:20:28 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:27:40 <@287459677611098114> why'd you ask if the b-2 was my 10th build?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 09:04:20 @<@287459677611098114>  why'd you ask if the b-2 was my 10th build?

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:57:25 And I can't decrease the length
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:57:37 Or it'll look off
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:58:25 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:58:39 But people are telling me the wings are too long
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:58:50 But of course they are
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:58:57 I can't change the angle
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:58:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:59:06 Theres only 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:59:09 And 1x1

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:00 I'd have to make it
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:04 2x bigger
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:13 To fit the motors
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:20 I'd have to use a bunch of motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:25 Just to get the angles right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:23:27 Fuck that

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:48:47 And down
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:48:54 When the seat is in the back
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:02:26 <@163143541160148992> would using this be better?

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:53:24 I feel like it depends on the person
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:53:34 Because our b-2 are pretty much identical
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:53:42 Mine is just longer and wider
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:54:11 Imma post it while the undes are hella active

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:02:31 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:02:54 Did you not just say
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:09 "and:
1) the requirement was only 30 upvotes back then
2)posts didn't go through #vip-general before going to hof"
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:28 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:30 Its not that
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:42 It's just that I've seen a lot of creations
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:47 That deserve hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:54 But I apologize for my ignorance
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:04:17 I didn't know of the small block limit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:05:15 "the amount of blocks we had back then is nothing compared to now"
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:06:01 F
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:06:16 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:06:50 When you're a new player and don't know shit about the game's past
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:06:51 😎
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:07:22 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:07:44 I thought the same blocks existed back then
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:08:03 I thought the only additions were the wheels
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:08:26 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:08:29 That's
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:08:30 Cancer

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:08:41 The old players
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:09:21 Tutorial builds are annoying
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:09:38 People copy others shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:09:43 And don't learn themselves
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:10:25 Wot reference
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:10:45 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:10:55 I agree with mechanisms
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:01 Like how to make threads
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:11 Swashplates
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:14 And folds
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:24 But things like the f-22 tuto
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:29 Tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:32 Make me cry
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:11:46 All you see In public servers is undes making it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:12:14 Have you seen the amount of tutorial a-10s?

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:15:57 I left because I got bullied by puri once
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:16:41 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:17:18 Dark is a furry weeb
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:17:20 😳

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:18:51 1x8 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:18:56 So making these things
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:19:06 Is gonna be a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:19:29 Well I'mma gonna have
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:19:40 1x8 torpedoes in them
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:19:51 I wonder if I'll even be able to do that
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:20:12 Do 1x1 propellers attack from any side?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:20:25 Or does it have to touch the front for them to attach
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:23:17 Omfg
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:23:27 Again
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:23:28 Bruh

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:24:49 <@163143541160148992> did any iowa or Montana include this on their hulls?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:25:02 Think its called belt armor
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:04 The fucking
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:07 Gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:09 Is so tiny
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:15 Compared to the Iowa
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:44 391 feet
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:45 Vs
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:27:58 887
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:28:05 I actually like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:28:11 It allows me to detail it more
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:28:19 I might make it a trifold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:32:11 <@287459677611098114> why does it look like it rammed into a mountain
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:32:48 I'm sorry
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:32:51 I cant stop
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:32:55 Laughing at it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:37:04 My dumbass still thinking about how I'm going to make work torpedoes launchers without making my gearing too big
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:37:41 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:37:52 If I making a realistic size
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:37:55 I'd be a
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:38:03 Double fold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:38:16 Rails?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:38:20 Tf are are rails
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:39:15 But they have to be accurate
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:39:20 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:44:39 <@163143541160148992>  should I make this
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:44:43 A quad fold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:44:45 Or tri fold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:44:49 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:45:33 Uh

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:48:07 I'm gonna make it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:48:17 A tri fold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:48:23 If I dont have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:49:24 A trifold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:49:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:50:01 <@321489477367496704> if I don't have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:50:06 I'll just do what vip did
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:54:47 <@321489477367496704> no
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:54:52 Unlike most people
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:03 Building their 3rd and 4th part
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:07 Upside down
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:17 I'm just gonna make it vertical
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:42 It's not like I'm copying his ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:48 Just the way he folds
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:55:53 As it'll be easier
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:56:04 <@163143541160148992> permission granted?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:56:15 Before this guy comes at me crazy

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:57:47 Would this ever get hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:57:50 It's kinda hot
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:57:59 It's not mine
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:58:24 No wonder people dont make destroyers
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:58:35 Making working torpedoes launchers
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:58:39 Is a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 09:11:49 I can't fucking find a close up shot of the gearing's torpedo launchers
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 09:19:48 That moment
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 09:19:52 When you have to play
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 09:19:54 Wow

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:46:17 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:46:35 I guess I'm making it a quad fold
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:48:50 I hope they add 1x8
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:49:00 Like I don't care about anything else
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:49:04 I just want 1x8
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:55:16 If you think about it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:56:23 F
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:56:27 Well
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:56:29 Guys
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:57:17 You could make a properly scaled iowa if you could somehow make it 5 folds
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:57:25 With each part
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:57:27 Being
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:57:43 53x51
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:57:55 But that's like impossible to fit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:58:10 But for a gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:58:17 You only need two folds
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:58:18 😎
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 10:58:25 To make it properly scaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:07 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:10 Yesterday two
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:15 I gotta
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:22 Make the hull skinnier
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:27 Or less wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:10:29 Whatever
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:26:06 Damn that's crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:26:09 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:26:17 I just gotta fix up the bow
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:43:51 When your hull outline is accurate af
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:43:53 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:44:13 The back looks bigger because of the angle
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:44:22 But it's the same size as everything else
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 11:44:42 <@163143541160148992>  how's this?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:17:55 <@584979690792419358> I got you

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:19:28 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:19:40 will make it taller later
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:19:51 i just wanted to make sure i had extra space
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:20:18

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:37:44 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:41:02 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:41:11 What do you play doom on
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:47:20 I use bright colors while building
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:47:29 To make sure I don't misplace anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:47:41 After I finish the build
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:47:53 I change the colors to good looking ones
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:47:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 12:48:14 Looks good
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:05:17 do what i do

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:08:37 <@262743221686370326>do this with your reference
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:08:39 Source
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:08:57 Myhull is so short
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:08:59 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:11 I think I might leave it like that tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:23 Half of it is underwater anyway
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:29 Get a side view
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:39 Of your Ac130
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:53 And then get a side view of the actual plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:09:56 If they line up
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:10:02 You're straight
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:10:52 OH GOD MY EYES
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:10:58 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:11:26 make sure to use a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:11:44 the amount of rockets youd need to make that fly would be laggy
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:12:18 lol thats slow af
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:12:32 use a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:12:41 you can make it go 300+ easily
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:19:20 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:19:26 Almost finished with the hull
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:19:45 I'll be using a piston system to make it taller

plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:36:42 Tryna flex on yamato
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:36:44 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:02 A realistic yamato would be like 5 plots long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:09 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:37 What
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:40 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:44 Each meter
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:46 Is like
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:49 One block
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:50 In game
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:38:35 Oh shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:38:41 That would take 6 plots
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:38:44 You're right
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:38:46 My bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:39:59 Wait what
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:40:11 Is the Iowa really longer than the yamato?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:40:19 I know the yamato is heavier
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:40:26 But is it really?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:42:32 *when you think you're turrets are oversized but  they look the same on the actual ship*
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:42:34 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:42:50 Those turrets almost look too big for it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:43:07 Cyg I'm talking about my ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:43:30 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:43:32 Weeb
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:44:45 People that don't know how to pronounce Japanese words=🤡
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:45:28 Japanese is legit easier to learn than english
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:45:39 Happens
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:45:46 Did you just load in?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:50:55 The super structure on a gearing is so fucking short
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:50:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:51:13 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:51:40 Imma search up the name of this one specifically
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:51:51 As this is the version I'm making
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:51:53 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:51:57 They were named
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:52:02 After marines
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:52:05 That won
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:52:11 The medal of honor
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:55:56 <@163143541160148992> <@335599526414909451> jeeez that's not what I meant for fuck sake
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:56:03 The ships also had nicknames
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:57:33 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:57:37 A lot of them
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:58:15 Were named after officers that received the navy cross or medal of honor <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:59:44 Like the uss Hawkins
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:05:09 *when you say the gearing class destroyers were named after officers that received the navy cross and medal of honor and are told you're wrong*
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:05:28 <@335599526414909451>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:06:13 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:06:27 That's how you get a smooth lined up deck on your ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:06:35 <@409676438682206218> wdm no space
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:06:41 It's legit a 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:28 <@287459677611098114> uh use motor locks and cameras to make the nose pointy
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:35 With trail blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:11:42 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:12:23 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:12:35 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:12:40 I can help you make it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:12:59 You'll need 4 motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:13:03 To make it work
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:13:22 K
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:13:36 Are you ever told
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:13:39 You're wrong
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:13:44 But are actually correct?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:15:43 <@287459677611098114> what?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:15:48 I wasn't talking about you
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:15:50 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:16:02 I was just asking you out of the blue
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:16:21 I was asking you if you're ever told you're wrong
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:16:44 .
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:16:48 Well yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:16:50 But no
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:17:59 <@287459677611098114> that was a rhetorical question
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:18:11 It's like
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:18:14 How one
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:18:20 Would talk to themselves
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:24:36 Clowns using standard time
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:26:21 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:26:56 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:28:31 When you have to move up your guns
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:28:34 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:32:11 I don't think its possible to remove them unless conveyors are removed entirely  <@299289130964090881>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:32:52 I wouldn't say it's a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:33:04 Magnets push things irl
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:33:09 Wdym it's a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:33:16 Have you not heard of rail guns
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:33:46 I haven't used a magnet drive yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:33:51 But don't they work
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:00 But pushing the one infront the otherM
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:13 Do
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:21 Think about how conveyor drives work
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:37 A conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:45 Is for carrying stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:34:50 To another location
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:01 But since the object is welded to the conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:05 It's always pushing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:14 Wdym x drag
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:34 Have you not used a conveyor drive on a b-2¿
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:40 It's slow af
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:47 And I have mine on
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:35:48 14
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:36:28 Well that's true
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:37:43 People that don't know how to make a ship turn with rockets=🤡
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:38:03 Custom made Rudders: am I a joke to you?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:38:40 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:39:29 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:42:57 Relatable
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:42:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:44:52 <@505835349889777685> what Russian ship is that?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:45:11 (Judging on the hull's color)
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:46:23 How are you still in the map with that speed?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:46:34 How do you even get a screenshot?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:46:39 You'll be alive
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:46:43 For like
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:46:45 1 second
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:06 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:09 Never
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:19 There's no point in going that fast
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:28 There is ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:37 I flew out once
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:41 And died after a while
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:47:55 And my altitude was 400
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:51:25 Imagine if the Bismarck was successful in its mission
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:51:29 😳😳😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:17:30 <@505835349889777685> didn't they remove them because of conveyor engines?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:17:58 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:18:25 I wonder how builds are before folding become a thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:18:49 Of course they are
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:22 Wdym are fireworks good
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:32 They're literally fireworks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:41 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:45 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:19:47 What?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:14 They should've just added flares instead for firworks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:29 Well
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:38 Depends on what stuff you build
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:20:47 I would get summer if you build ships
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:21:03 Because of pontoons
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:21:14 And that wheel thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:08 🥰
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:18 😍
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:22:26 USS Gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:23:33 Warships are useless if they're longer than 2 plots
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:23:51 "Ocean" isn't big enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:24:29 BRUH
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:24:34 Let me see?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:25:55 <@562896984344625183> why is the coffins floating
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:26:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:26:15 That thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:26:18 I already saw it
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:25 A realisticy scaled uss gearing would be 2.6 plots long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:33 Mine is 4
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:29:35 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:37:35 .
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:38:24 .
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:39:14 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:40:37 Stop upvoting tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:42:26 Dark how do you not have designer 5 yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:03 I'm blind
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:06 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:27 <@416215683089563649> that's a bad build
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:28 Wdym
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:46 My a-10 is 753
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:43:57 800 would be too big
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:44:06 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:44:08 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:44:45 BRUH
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:44:57 A realistically sized a-10
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:45:01 Would be 16 blocks long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:45:07 Goodluck 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:45:14 Long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:46:30 When your a-10 is 36 blocks long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:46:39 NOT REALISTIC!
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 20:48:19 Racism spotted
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:03 Guys
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:07 I put my goldfish
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:12 In the freezer
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:53:19 <@600133849074237481>  we don't
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:53:30 Dislike b-2s
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:53:40 You just gotta make a good one
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:53:53 There's only 4 b-2s in this server that got 10+ upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:56:11 <@456226577798135808> spam?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:58:13 <@456226577798135808> what?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:58:35 <@403590573799505922> nice ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:58:42 Might get hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:58:45 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:58:59 What ship is it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:59:25 What class
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:59:49 I don't know much about modern
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:59:53 Or any ships in general
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:01:59 Well
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:02:08 I'm making a USS Gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:02:15 Can I get pics with you after?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:02:40 What I have so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:03:26 I need to move up the first gun up
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:03:31 By 1-2 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:03:38 For it to be accurate
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:36:40 fail or win?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:36:49 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:36:52 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:36:57 torpedo launchers
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:37:02 good or bad?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:38:25 gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:38:42 the one in the back
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:38:47 the biggest one
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:38:50 isnt being used
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:39:40 <@!557172100545249281>  only this one is being used
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:40:05 theyre the same scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:40:09 believe it or not
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:40:29 the guns are wider
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:41:30 But the torpedo launchers are longer
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:42:26 The launchers are tiny compared
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:42:29 To the guns
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:42:37 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:42:54 I'd say they're properly scaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:43:16 So what do you think? <@557172100545249281>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:43:36 Only this gun is being used
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:43:44 The other one is a larger model
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:46:06 torpedo launcher
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:46:14 14.5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:46:56 guns
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:46:59 are
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:47:04 12 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:47:19 so i'd sy thats a proper scaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:47:33 holy if i made them bigger that would be too big
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:48:03 guns are 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:48:12 torpedo launchers
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:48:13 5
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:48:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:48:58 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:49:15 The length is pretty accurate
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:49:35 Sadly I cant make the launchers wider
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:49:56 There's a small gap between each launcher
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:50:00 Which isn't possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:50:09 It's like 1/8 of a block
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:53:12 its a gearing from wot im using as 3d reference
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:55:20 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:55:43 i have created a new "circle" to add to my collection of turret rings
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:55:49 
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 23:58:37 
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 00:00:58 "your guns are too big"

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:33:44 *saves every 2 mins just to make sure to get everything*

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:41:56 the thing on top of a ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:42:31 im pretty sure everything above the deck
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:42:52 is the superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:43:14 <@!600950115900981267>  is it a problem its a quad fold?

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:46:47 hopefully everything fits
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:46:55 should be around 8k-10k
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:47:01

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:50:30 When you load it in
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:50:32 Its invisible
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:50:44 Hopefully that doesn't change tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:50:58 Or 90% of the ships built are screwed
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:51:03 With other fold builds

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:38:12 Epic most people don't
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:38:54 Epic I think the reason people dont is because of save space
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:39:17 My ship isn't finished and is already 5k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:39:26 And my save data is at 190
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:40:11 I feel like motors and other mechanical blocks take up more save data
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:40:24 Because rowdy made a build that's like 17k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:40:36 And still had save data remaining

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:42:19 dude legit just copy my hull
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:42:32 and make 14 blocks shorter
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:42:57 a gearing is the same thing but longer and double barreled turrets
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:43:30 i can help you design the guns
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:43:43 i made pretty good bofors so that shouldnt be too hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:44:37 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:45:38 my ships only weakness are targets that are directly above it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:45:42 <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:45:53 and submarines
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:46:19 sadly depth charges dont work because they explode when they fall into the water
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:46:47 might want to make it skinnier jack
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:48:56 but i need them to be 1x1
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:49:35 uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:49:39 thats way too wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:49:48 my ship is 23 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:51:27 maple what do you think of my wip gearing?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:51:49 <@!300103214873968650>  make the ship 17 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:51:55 23 too big
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:52:12 i do
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:52:19 even easier
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 04:52:27 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:13:18 jack make it 2:1 scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:14:00 2 times bigger than the actual thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:14:12 that way you get to keep that size
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:14:27 23 would be like 2:1 scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:16:22 Wip
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:16:30 whats crazy about the gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:17:00 is the turrets are more than half the height of the funnels
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:18:23 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 05:18:51 I wonder how I'm gonna get those numbers on it

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:59:31 <@300103214873968650> I'm gonna have to remove the torpedo launchers in the back
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:59:41 As the real one didn't have them
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 07:59:57 There's supposed to be bofors there
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:00:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:00:54 This is the same exact one I'm building
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:01:09 It has oerlikons
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:01:13 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:01:42 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:02:56 God I hate
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:02:59 How
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:03 The gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:08 Was updated
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:10 So many times
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:13 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:36 Some pictures have an extra torpedo launcher
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:42 While some have more bofors
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:48 Some have no oerlikons
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:53 Some do
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:55 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:03:57 Ye
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:12 They're the same model tho..
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:16 It's the same ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:40 I'm making dd 710 but it was updated a lot so f <@321489477367496704>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:53 I can't choose a specific one
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:56 It's the same ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:05:15 I guess I'll go with different time periods
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:52 I fucking hate when I search up the dd 710 other gearings show up
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:13 The dd 710 was called the uss gearing
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:19 Its funny
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:26 Because it's also the name of the class
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:28 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:07 That's the one I'm using
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:25 Oh nice turret
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:26 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:43 <@287459677611098114> it's not that
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:47 Its just that I fear
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:50 Some nerd
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:57 Will look at a different version
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:09 And call it inaccurate
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:19 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:27 VIP knows what version I'm building
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:18 I'm just say
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:22 Dark
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:26 I'm planning on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:35 I'm just gonna say
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:13:07 It's a USS Gearing (DD-710 1946) <@287459677611098114>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:13:34 Ships are fun to detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:14:30 <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:14:37 Depth charges?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:15:02 I  gotta make a functioning version
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:15:05 Or I could just
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:15:09 Use tnt balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:15:54 Wait deci made working torpedo launchers?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:16:24 I said I have to make a functioning version
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:16:46 They're just cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:17:20 Well depth charges wouldn't really work as blocks float
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:17:31 And I need the depth charges to be
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:17:33 1x1
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:17:38 Or 1x1.5
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:19 <@287459677611098114> my ship is pretty good at pvp tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:25 Even without depth charges
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:32 It has working bofors
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:34 And turrets
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:52 In vip1
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:57 I got attacked by like
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:18:59 6 planes
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:19:09 It was a nightmare because of how laggy it was
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:19:23 I made it to fight ships not planes ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:20:27 Make it one block shorter
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:20:35 The barrel
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:21:16 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:21:20 Who are you?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:21:46 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:23:24 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:23:28 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:23:31 The evolution
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:23:52 4
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:23:56 23
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:09 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:17 <@456226577798135808> no
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:20 A battleship
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:28 Is supposed to be like
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:32 5-7 plots long
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:24:50 <@456226577798135808> my destroyer is 2:1 scale
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:25:15 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:25:18 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:25:42 A 1:1 Bismarck
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:25:45 Would be like
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:25:51 5-6 plots long?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:27:04 😳
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:28:14 Good luck with that... <@351848864531218442>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:30:08 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:39:05 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:37:53 This would've probably been on hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:38:03 If it had
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:38:07 Bofors
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:38:35 And
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:38:46 Oerlikons
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:40:13 Not mine btw
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:40:32 They don't?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:42:02 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:42:09 They function the same way right?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:42:41 I never really looked at Soviet ships to realize that
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:43:01 I've only seen German and American ships
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:46:06 I think I might make an ironclad after I get hof with my destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:46:38 I only have one ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:49:47 <@287459677611098114> low?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:49:57 Compared to the other ships
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:03 In hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:10 Looks like I have a high chance
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:21 I mean vip likes it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:38 That's stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:51:28 <@448505589983739914> dude that looks really good
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:51:33 Sci-fi ship?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:52:16 
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:52:20 Which one should I build?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:53:29 I like the 2nd one the most
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:53:49 You sure they use paddles?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:54:03 I think they have engines for that

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:23:59 turns out
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:24:13 if you turn a big structure into metal
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:24:16 or glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:10 so i always save my creations before turning them into a different material
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:24 i turned into metal
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:32 and decided default was better
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:42 so i reloaded it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:50 and all the 1x1 blocks in it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:25:53 go deleted
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:26:01 and it said i had no 1x1 blocks

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 07:09:31 It dumb how a wing can be shot off with like 2 rounds
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 07:09:41 It should just go right through
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 07:09:44 And leave a hole
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 07:09:55 Not fucking rip the entire wing off

general 2020-06-23 08:35:23 Had to be below 6 degrees
general 2020-06-23 08:35:28 Or I'd lose control of the plane

general 2020-07-10 17:52:13 I cant wait for them to add battleships
general 2020-07-10 17:52:38 Imagine playing as a fighter on player controlled carriers
general 2020-07-10 17:52:52 True
general 2020-07-10 17:53:33 I wonder why warthunder doesn't have  larger carriers
general 2020-07-10 17:53:42 In naval battles
general 2020-07-10 17:54:10 Don't they have a south Carolina in the game?
general 2020-07-10 17:54:21 I swear I saw one in naval battles
general 2020-07-10 17:54:53 It probably be glitchy too
general 2020-07-10 17:55:03 Like imagine going through it
general 2020-07-10 17:55:32 You ever land at 201 speed and your landing gear glitch underground and the whole thing just blows up
general 2020-07-10 17:57:58 Is that exclusive to ground battles?

general 2020-07-10 18:00:00 Number one tip for playing air realistic battles
general 2020-07-10 18:00:07 Never dog fight a spitfire
general 2020-07-10 18:00:32 I can kill bf109s
general 2020-07-10 18:00:36 But spitfires
general 2020-07-10 18:00:40 God they're cancer
general 2020-07-10 18:00:50 
general 2020-07-10 18:01:17 I actually survived a spit fire once even tho they were on my tail for 2 minutes
general 2020-07-10 18:01:21 The idiot ran out of ammo
general 2020-07-10 18:07:04 Bruh dumb people really be like
general 2020-07-10 18:07:27 "Trump is banning tiktok because he doesn't like Chinese people "

general 2020-07-10 18:07:46 ?
general 2020-07-10 18:08:00 "He's banned it"
general 2020-07-10 18:08:06 Trump doesn't decide that
general 2020-07-10 18:08:07 Idiot
general 2020-07-10 18:08:22 You really think trump has that power?
general 2020-07-10 18:08:31 Jeez you guys dont know anything
general 2020-07-10 18:08:44 I bet you think he creates laws huh
general 2020-07-10 18:08:52 Dude the uk banned it
general 2020-07-10 18:09:47 <@163143541160148992>  when you're attacking bombers do you go for the fuselage or wings?
general 2020-07-10 18:10:05 B109s always shoot my fuselage
general 2020-07-10 18:10:14 Even tho it only takes 2 rounds to the wings
general 2020-07-10 18:10:21 To take out a b-17
general 2020-07-10 18:10:35 Bruh
general 2020-07-10 18:10:40 Wheel
general 2020-07-10 18:10:42 😳
general 2020-07-10 18:11:09 > better to fire at either horizontal stabilizers or engines/wings
<@163143541160148992>  yep
general 2020-07-10 18:11:28 I usually get my rudder shot off first
general 2020-07-10 18:11:34 But that does nothing
general 2020-07-10 18:11:43 The b-17 has combat flaps
general 2020-07-10 18:11:45 😎
general 2020-07-10 18:12:19 I've had my tail wings shot off
general 2020-07-10 18:12:29 But as long as you have your flaps you can control it
general 2020-07-10 18:13:36 
general 2020-07-10 18:14:11 Yeah I had a engine fire before
general 2020-07-10 18:14:58 It's always my mid right engine that's caught on fire

general 2020-07-11 07:24:45 50-250 coins per crate
general 2020-07-11 07:24:55 I would pick hallengard
general 2020-07-11 07:25:01 As they can sell crates
general 2020-07-11 07:25:06 And rob from pirates
general 2020-07-11 07:25:26 Or whitecrest
general 2020-07-11 07:25:31 Whitecrest is best for trade
general 2020-07-11 07:55:38 Anyone down for war thunder?

general 2020-07-23 06:04:39 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

general 2020-07-31 09:19:47 Wrong one
general 2020-07-31 09:20:05 Also I sorta updated the engines
general 2020-07-31 09:20:10 Haven't posted it
general 2020-07-31 09:22:37 <@163143541160148992>  they're 3
general 2020-07-31 09:22:40 I think
general 2020-07-31 09:22:43 Or is 2.5
general 2020-07-31 09:22:46 Dont remember
general 2020-07-31 09:22:58 <@287779983445721088>  it is what it is
general 2020-07-31 09:23:06 Wait
general 2020-07-31 09:23:09 By that image
general 2020-07-31 09:23:13 My wings are too thin
general 2020-07-31 09:23:16 😳
general 2020-07-31 09:23:40 Stupid fov
general 2020-07-31 09:23:42 I hate fov
general 2020-07-31 09:23:43 😡
general 2020-07-31 09:24:20 What's this thing called again?
general 2020-07-31 09:25:29 There might be a pbj in hof soon
general 2020-07-31 09:25:36 If he plays his cards right
general 2020-07-31 09:26:06 You'll just have to wait and see
general 2020-07-31 09:26:28 If he plays his cards right it should get hof
general 2020-07-31 09:26:34 Mans made the best engines ever
general 2020-07-31 09:26:37 😍
general 2020-07-31 09:26:44 Them boys do be round
general 2020-07-31 09:29:44 I hate fov
general 2020-07-31 09:29:56 If I line it up with the engines
general 2020-07-31 09:30:07 Wings a block too thick
general 2020-07-31 09:30:14 If I line it up with the fuselage
general 2020-07-31 09:30:18 A block too thin
general 2020-07-31 09:31:39 Doesn't that happen with all planes that use motors for flaps and rudders?
general 2020-07-31 09:35:09 Eh I don't know
general 2020-07-31 09:35:16 I never had stability issues
general 2020-07-31 09:35:24 
general 2020-07-31 09:35:38 This is a better image I guess
general 2020-07-31 09:37:23 The green like represents what it looks like under the wing<@163143541160148992>
general 2020-07-31 09:37:29 Can't really tell from that shot
general 2020-07-31 09:37:32 Low quality
general 2020-07-31 09:37:39 And no color variation
general 2020-07-31 09:39:05 I use half block halfwedge, wedges half wedge, 3 blocks and then one 1x4 wedge or 1x3 depending on the area <@163143541160148992>
general 2020-07-31 09:39:16 Hopefully that can give you a better image

general 2020-07-31 10:32:32 Time to shave
general 2020-07-31 10:32:34 😍
general 2020-07-31 10:45:11 Which should I make next?
general 2020-07-31 10:45:46 None of those is a b-29...
general 2020-07-31 10:47:44 XB-15
general 2020-07-31 10:48:39 Typo
general 2020-07-31 10:49:23 Them wings do be chonk
general 2020-07-31 10:49:30 This is going to be fun
general 2020-07-31 10:53:48 The xb-15 had a wing spawn of 149 feet
general 2020-07-31 10:53:50 😳
general 2020-07-31 10:54:24 If I made it 1:1 scale it would fit in a plot without any folds
general 2020-07-31 10:54:29 I'll make it 3:1 scale
general 2020-07-31 10:54:35 This thing is gonna be hot
general 2020-07-31 10:56:05 I'm gonna have to use 5x5 cylinders for the landing gear...
general 2020-07-31 10:56:34 
general 2020-07-31 10:56:37 Very chonk
general 2020-07-31 10:57:06 Each rear landing gear was a ton
general 2020-07-31 10:57:10 😎
general 2020-07-31 10:59:14 There's man sized passages in the wings
general 2020-07-31 10:59:30 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2020-07-31 11:00:46 It can carry 36 thousand pounds of bombs
general 2020-07-31 11:03:49 <@723419054114865202>  do cameras have a hitbox?
general 2020-07-31 11:03:58 Oh

general 2020-07-31 11:08:31 I can already tell the tail is going to be the hardest part
general 2020-07-31 11:09:06 Where my 1x6-1x10 wedges at?
general 2020-07-31 11:09:08 😡
general 2020-07-31 11:09:39 Them chonky wings tho
general 2020-07-31 11:09:41 😳
general 2020-07-31 11:10:31 
general 2020-07-31 11:10:44 Almost as wide as the fuselage
general 2020-07-31 11:11:13 That plane probably flies slow af tbh
general 2020-07-31 11:11:50 It could probably travel the Atlantic ocean by just gliding
general 2020-07-31 11:15:35 B-50 also looks pretty cool
general 2020-07-31 11:15:48 But kids will just think it's a b-29 and downvote it
general 2020-07-31 11:17:06 Pretty much
general 2020-07-31 11:18:11 
general 2020-07-31 11:19:10 By that statement
general 2020-07-31 11:19:17 I meant kids will just be like
general 2020-07-31 11:19:27 The b-29 doesn't have engines like that
general 2020-07-31 11:19:31 Or turrets like that
general 2020-07-31 11:19:33 😡
general 2020-07-31 11:19:36 Downvote!
general 2020-07-31 11:19:42 Eh I could always lost the amme
general 2020-07-31 11:19:44 Yeah
general 2020-07-31 11:20:03 Well the b-29 is overused
general 2020-07-31 11:20:19 So I'll go with the xb-15
general 2020-07-31 11:20:40 Someone already made one I think <@259742168661360641>
general 2020-07-31 11:21:06 I can just imagine how much lag my future xb-15 will cause
general 2020-07-31 11:21:16 It'll be like 7k blocks....
general 2020-07-31 11:21:34 My b-25 is 4k blocks
general 2020-07-31 11:21:36 😳
general 2020-07-31 11:22:08 BRYY
general 2020-07-31 11:23:32 How will I even make landing gear for a 7k-8k block plane...
general 2020-07-31 11:23:42 The motors will just break...
general 2020-07-31 11:27:22 So proud of myself, I finally got 40+ upvotes

general 2020-07-31 11:31:46 The world is flat
general 2020-07-31 11:31:55 Vipempire is my world

general 2020-07-31 11:32:01 So yeah
general 2020-07-31 11:56:47 I'm really confused on why the b-29 was created if they already had the b-19
general 2020-07-31 12:00:04 <@437078588701933568>  <@508065143905845248>  you boys down to build one with me?

general 2020-07-31 12:00:52 No
general 2020-07-31 12:01:06 36k vs 16k
general 2020-07-31 12:01:35 They should've just upgraded the b-19
general 2020-07-31 12:02:29 Wait no
general 2020-07-31 12:02:31 It was 20k
general 2020-07-31 12:02:46 What
general 2020-07-31 12:02:50 Stupid sources
general 2020-07-31 12:03:00 Some say it could carry 30k pounds

general 2020-07-31 12:15:44 
general 2020-07-31 12:16:12 
general 2020-07-31 12:19:03 The fucking b-19 is bigger than a b-52

general 2020-07-31 12:22:32 <@456226577798135808> can I land my b-19 on your ship when I finish it?
general 2020-07-31 12:23:33 It'll be 212 blocks wide
general 2020-07-31 12:25:10 3:1 scale
general 2020-07-31 12:25:51 😈
general 2020-07-31 12:26:36 Like I did my b-25 ;) <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-07-31 12:40:50 Pretty much a b-25 with smaller wings and tail
general 2020-07-31 13:09:50 Even if they do I don't think it'll get far
general 2020-07-31 13:09:54 It's a ugly vehicle
general 2020-07-31 13:10:06 With a cannon
general 2020-07-31 13:10:52 Well I'm gonna build this beauty

general 2020-08-01 01:13:44 I didn't add the rudder
general 2020-08-01 01:13:54 This is just the fuselage
general 2020-08-01 01:14:12 And the turret it has in the front
general 2020-08-01 01:15:00 It has a 37 mm turret

general 2020-08-01 06:54:13 but thatll look weird
general 2020-08-01 06:54:31 i could also make the angle with motor locks but i wont have enough space
general 2020-08-01 06:54:58 i guess ill just wait and see if i actually dont
general 2020-08-01 06:55:12 if i do ill form the angles with motorlocks

plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:10:23 i always try to improve so i'd like to know why people downvote
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:12:18 i cant believe i got 23 upvotes on half a fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:12:22 bruh

plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:24:41 <@551573378662662145>  I had 5 bacon hairs invade my plot
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:24:54 They kept spamming yes sir
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:25:00 Reporting for duty sir
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:25:36 My fuselage without smoothing is 2.3k
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:18 I really hope my bomber doesn't go over 6k
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:22 Or 5k
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:30 Its going to be so painful to fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:43 The turbo radius is going to kill me
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:52 Hopefully the huge rudder it has helps
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:26:58 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:27:21 This thing is almost the size as my old submarine
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:27:59 I'm going to fill the wings with wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:28:15 And I'll have 2 conveyor engines in the wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:28:23 It it put in the center itll pitch up
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:28:58 That sure is a weird plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:29:11 To forward engines and two backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:30:03 That's pretty much a b-17 with a dad bod <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:30:13 I think I'll get noob to make a xb-15
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:31:04 Not as big as the xb-19
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:31:15 173v132
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:31:31 Wait..

plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:32:57 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:33:02 Hella turrets too
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:33:49 The real challenge will be folding the wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:34:16 And using motor locks to push them into the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:34:20 Since they're bigger
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:36:39 The turret on the xb-19 is pretty much a snow globe
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:40:47 Ill work on it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:40:47 
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:40:48 Im tired

plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:42:54 But its pretty close to what I have now
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:46:32 It's sad how there isn't a single xb-19 left
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 08:46:39 All they saved were the landing gear

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:37:46 This is why I hate blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:03 One isn't even symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:05 🤡
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:27 So what to do now?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:47 <@429826358827417601>  I have no idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:52 Only one was like built
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:34 <@435946988559925248>  where the wing ends meet the fuselage?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:39 Yeah planning on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:47 This just just the simple build
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:53 No details
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:56 Or motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:03 So
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:06 Should I go
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:08 With the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:10 Or top
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:44 I don't use magnets
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:41:02 
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:41:08 use this
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:41:41 motorlock folds prevent the wings from breaking
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:42:04 make sure the joint is unpowered
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:42:10 
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:12:48 this proves the blueprint isnt symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:13:37 mech from titanfall would be weak af to rpg
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:14:29 well mech woulds never take the role of tanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:00 yeah but they arent as strong as tanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:09 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:16 no sloped armor
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:26 and it would have to be a lot lighterto be able to walk
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:45 a mech would never be able to mach the armor of a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:15:50 it would be too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:16:26 youd have to have godzilla legs on a mech the size of a abrams

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:11:44 I'm not talking about the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:11:46 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:12:26 <@733931029890596943>
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:12:32 The barrel is an easy fix
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:12:36 This shit gets me
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:13:07 Well time to redo the frontal plate

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:45:23 Just gotta fix the gun and add details B)
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:53:50 pov do be gay tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:54:45 
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:55:21 Front looks short because of pov
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 10:55:30 But I lined it up with the turret
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:05:57 I dont know what happened to the quality but this is what I got <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:06:08 
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:06:17 I know one side is different
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:06:41 But I'd have to make the gun static
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:06:59 And the motor locks would make my head hurt
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:07:15 I watched maple try to form the angle for a good 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:07:24 Its too many motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:11:05 I pretty much just need to detail now
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:11:24 Most of them will probably need motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:11:29 <@652447373737590794> motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 11:25:57 > <@!177743269105500160> do you know why alexa is unreal wide

general 2020-08-10 01:59:59 I'm planning on using 1x2
general 2020-08-10 02:00:06 Thats the closest angle to the actual thing
general 2020-08-10 02:02:01 > maybe make the transition from the slant to the vertical siding of the turret better
<@435946988559925248> I dont get how id do that
general 2020-08-10 02:02:40 Wait which part you talking about exactly

general 2020-08-11 01:56:41 I'm pretty sure plane crazy is called that from people going insane from playing it
general 2020-08-11 01:57:16 Herguggi's motor locks do be killing brain cells tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:48:43 In an argument with a blue haired girl that thinks she doesn't have rights
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:48:44 😎

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:51:00 😎
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:51:26 Huh?
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:51:29 Haven't seen it
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:51:54 Tf
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:52:26 I have to remake my gun
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:53:27 <@311638025308209154>  nah he was excited that I was making a xb-19
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:53:53 Probably not gonna happen
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:53:57 The wings pain me
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:54:19 Gonna need motor locks that I can't even fit
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:54:36 The entire plot will just be covered in them if i make the wings smooth
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:01:53 Why does every abrams in creations have flat sides
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:02:05 The angle of the sides is pretty close to 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:03:17 When vip1 full
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:03:23 :(
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 04:42:25 Barrel a block too long
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 04:47:07 Big sad
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 04:47:35 Why is the left side wider :(
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 04:51:59 When pov makes the barrel look oversized
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 04:52:06 
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:18:51 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:19:30 You just use a random blue print, use some photo editing app, make two layers one for build and one for blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:19:35 Make the blueprint second layer
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:19:44 And make it 40-60% transparent
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:20:40 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:22:38 I need help making flare launchers
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:25:45 Kinda sucks how simple the hull is
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:27:19 
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:30:57 Not for the hull
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:32:15 The only detail the hull has is from the driver's view port, back and threads
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:33:41 im not talking about that3
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:43:31 I did
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:43:32 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:44:48 Thats like the first part I made
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:55:02 I have no idea

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 05:55:07 😎

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:13:31 I wonder why he made the barrle is long
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:15:05 <@363742162757877761> yeah but its not that long
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:15:50 
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:16:17 His barrel should only be like 3 blocks longer than mine
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:19:29 Might be a different kind of gun
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:19:32 Who knows
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:20:12 He should take 3 blocks out the barrel at least
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:22:29 Im pretty sure this is the same version
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:25:59 Nah they're not the same gun
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 06:26:11 I guess guggi and puri are the only ones to know
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 07:29:49 Just need hull detail, threads, and paintjob
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 07:30:59 Dang :(
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 07:31:45 Yeah i took it as a joke

creations-chat 2020-09-27 00:50:38 > Tbh the turrent doesnt look on scale with the hull even with blueprints the pov on blueprint will be flat so if you use it as a fish scale the blueprint will make it look fat (repost)

general 2020-09-27 03:36:39 Wait nvm that would be like 1.5 plots long
general 2020-09-27 03:36:41 Too small
general 2020-09-27 03:37:46 Should i make it 1:1 scale?
general 2020-09-27 03:38:38 If i make it 1.1 it'll be the perfect size for a quad fold
general 2020-09-27 03:38:52 21 blocks wide
general 2020-09-27 03:39:01 183 blocks long
general 2020-09-27 03:39:16 Wait I'd have to make it a bit smaller
general 2020-09-27 03:39:18 So
general 2020-09-27 03:40:26 I'll make it 19 blocks wide and 165 blocks long<@163143541160148992>
general 2020-09-27 03:43:28 <@163143541160148992>  how does 16 blocks tall sound for the hull?

general 2020-09-28 16:44:35 > The more I play against Germany in War Thunder air matches, the more I think there is legit some bias for them. Their bombers are incredibly strong. Even unrealistically strong, whilst American bombers snap apart at the slightest touch, and yet IRL they could take beating that no other bombers could. German bombers can outspeed even Mustangs. Their defensive armament will chew up fighters. And I have set **3 fires** on a 264 just and all three were put out in a couple of seconds. Yet American fighters struggle to put out fires even when diving at 700+ km/h with self sealing tanks.
<@505835349889777685> fighting Italians is worse<:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>

general 2020-10-08 04:18:37 American prop planes are ass
general 2020-10-08 04:19:43 I just want 7-8.3
general 2020-10-08 04:20:03 Bro im talking about that
general 2020-10-08 04:20:15 I call them shit because of their climb rate
general 2020-10-08 04:20:17 And turn time
general 2020-10-08 04:20:27 "Side climb"
general 2020-10-08 04:20:30 That doesn't work
general 2020-10-08 04:20:38 That doesn't work
general 2020-10-08 04:20:48 Put it in a 3d graph
general 2020-10-08 04:22:38 Yeah I know
general 2020-10-08 04:22:41 But the thing
general 2020-10-08 04:22:46 You're not using your brain
general 2020-10-08 04:22:53 While your busy side climb
general 2020-10-08 04:23:00 Your enemy will be at 7-8k
general 2020-10-08 04:23:09 
general 2020-10-08 04:23:12 This one image explains it
general 2020-10-08 04:23:24 White is American side climbing
general 2020-10-08 04:23:33 Blue is German climb straight
general 2020-10-08 04:23:56 If the German plane never stops climbing it will always be at a higher alt till it reaches max alt
general 2020-10-08 04:24:15 You telling me I'm gonna side climb to 12k? Fuck that
general 2020-10-08 04:24:28 Legit the only times I win in air battles
general 2020-10-08 04:24:38 Is when someone baits all the enemies to low alt
general 2020-10-08 04:24:56 And they have to be pretty stupid to go for one plane
general 2020-10-08 04:25:23 <@505835349889777685>  you can't out run a bf109
general 2020-10-08 04:25:34 What?

general 2020-10-08 04:26:26 Dude you have to be stupid to be out turned in a bf109 or spitfire
general 2020-10-08 04:26:39 Yes, you do.
general 2020-10-08 04:26:51 I was testing the bf109 in the Americas tech tree
general 2020-10-08 04:26:58 And it legit turns way better
general 2020-10-08 04:27:13 Its the same thing??
general 2020-10-08 04:28:53 They literally have the same turn rate...
general 2020-10-08 04:29:00 20.7

general 2020-10-08 04:29:44 Even if I side climb
general 2020-10-08 04:29:52 The image i sent explains it
general 2020-10-08 04:29:58 Yes
general 2020-10-08 04:30:08 But they have more speed
general 2020-10-08 04:30:29 Jets actually have worse climb rate
general 2020-10-08 04:30:57 Bro what?
general 2020-10-08 04:31:04 The f-82 is a fucking brick

general 2020-10-08 04:40:21 He said he gets them to overshoot and gets behind them
general 2020-10-08 04:40:32 How tf do you get on zero tail
general 2020-10-08 04:40:38 It can easily reverse it
general 2020-10-08 04:40:46 Sped zeros?
general 2020-10-08 04:41:09 I don't think I've ever lost to Japanese

general 2020-10-11 23:56:03 Anyone here good with swashplates that dont use rockets or hover engines
general 2020-10-12 01:00:55 <@587459840255983616>  can you show me your rotor system
general 2020-10-12 01:01:12 <@467565971918422017>  funny tank barrel
general 2020-10-12 01:01:20 <@587459840255983616>  can you show me it.

general 2020-10-12 01:03:16 All the swashplates I see on YouTube are bad
general 2020-10-12 01:03:22 They either use rockets
general 2020-10-12 01:03:25 Or are too big
general 2020-10-12 01:03:42 Thats a furry
general 2020-10-12 01:06:12 Someone teach how to make rotor that works
general 2020-10-12 01:06:14 😎
general 2020-10-12 01:07:10 That's a stupid question <@527653676022628353>
general 2020-10-12 01:07:14 Of course they play pc
general 2020-10-12 01:07:22 How else would they find the server
general 2020-10-12 01:10:45 <@527653676022628353>  look at their roles noob
general 2020-10-12 01:19:17 Damn
general 2020-10-12 01:19:24 Life sucks
general 2020-10-12 01:19:31 Helicopter too complex
general 2020-10-12 01:19:52 Well
general 2020-10-12 01:19:56 A small single rotor
general 2020-10-12 01:19:58 One is
general 2020-10-12 01:20:12 I don't even think its possible
general 2020-10-12 02:58:46 Make motor spin faster😎
general 2020-10-12 03:58:13 Guys
general 2020-10-12 03:58:27 <@393679134779375616>  show me your rotor system
general 2020-10-12 03:58:51 How does one make a heli with a single rotor??
general 2020-10-12 03:58:58 Like bruh
general 2020-10-12 03:59:03 Eww jets
general 2020-10-12 03:59:07 Gross
general 2020-10-12 03:59:20 Doesn't work
general 2020-10-12 03:59:37 Doesn't work lol
general 2020-10-12 03:59:44 Main rotor too strong
general 2020-10-12 04:00:14 The hell are tip jets
general 2020-10-12 04:00:29 > Single rotor is simple 1 unpowered motor then angle the blades the add engines at the tip
<@393679134779375616>  you can't get heli role like that
general 2020-10-12 04:01:10 Okay so what you're saying is none of you guys know how to make a working rotor?
general 2020-10-12 04:02:11 Non coaxial
general 2020-10-12 04:02:19 > Like so u mean counter main prop with a tail prop
<@587459840255983616>  yes
general 2020-10-12 04:02:26 I don't think that's possible
general 2020-10-12 04:02:34 Unless you make tail rotor huge
general 2020-10-12 04:03:05 > turn down the speed of main rotor
<@460486763408785408>  doesn't work
general 2020-10-12 04:03:24 Yeah all I can think of is motorlocking wings into tail rotor
general 2020-10-12 04:03:30 > hmm
<@460486763408785408>  stfu with that
general 2020-10-12 04:03:45 > just use tip jets
<@460486763408785408>  shut
general 2020-10-12 04:04:15 You can't get heli role with rockets
general 2020-10-12 04:04:24 Also using rockets on a heli
general 2020-10-12 04:04:28 Thats not how helis work
general 2020-10-12 04:04:34 Chinook ugly
general 2020-10-12 04:04:56 I can't think of any American helis that use two main rotor
general 2020-10-12 04:05:01 Only russian
general 2020-10-12 04:05:28 If your main can't pitch, roll, or yaw you're poo
general 2020-10-12 04:05:55 Yeah I'm either just making a ka-52
general 2020-10-12 04:06:09 Or apache with motorlock tail rotor
general 2020-10-12 04:06:28 Thing is
general 2020-10-12 04:06:33 I only make American vehicles
general 2020-10-12 04:06:44 Russian poo
general 2020-10-12 04:07:01 Shut russian <@546223347025969164>

general 2020-10-12 04:08:41 Ugly <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-10-12 04:08:58 Only apache and ka-52 sexy
general 2020-10-12 04:09:43 We also suck at tank
general 2020-10-12 04:09:50 Abrams upper plate be like
general 2020-10-12 04:21:17 Funny broken heli
general 2020-10-12 04:25:03 <@456226577798135808>  how make fly within it yeeting itself
general 2020-10-12 04:26:21 No
general 2020-10-12 04:26:56 Heli with two main rotor=easy
general 2020-10-12 04:27:18 How single rotor <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-10-12 04:27:29 > Heli with one main rotor = easy
<@587459840255983616>  how
general 2020-10-12 04:27:49 Real
general 2020-10-12 04:27:54 Fake is easy
general 2020-10-12 04:28:26 I haven't seen a single small non coaxial tutorial <@430394898726780940>
general 2020-10-12 04:29:20 Funny
general 2020-10-12 04:29:45 When you use ropes to turn

general 2020-10-12 04:31:24 I don't know how to do with suspension
general 2020-10-12 04:32:04 How do you make it retract and extend tbo
general 2020-10-12 04:32:06 Tho
general 2020-10-12 04:32:18 Uh

general 2020-10-12 04:39:42 I wonder if its possible to make this in pc
general 2020-10-12 04:40:31 Probably not cause roblox physic poo
general 2020-10-12 04:41:41 <@722974995118162041>  stop
general 2020-10-12 04:41:42 Stop
general 2020-10-12 04:49:27 Man all I want to do is make a good heli that doesn't use rockets 😥
general 2020-10-12 04:50:00 Guess I'll just use double rotor
general 2020-10-12 04:50:25 
general 2020-10-12 04:50:37 Doesn't work
general 2020-10-12 04:50:48 Rotors cancer
general 2020-10-12 04:51:06 Either make them cringe with rockest on propeller blades
general 2020-10-12 04:51:09 Or make them huge
general 2020-10-12 04:51:26 @aeght
general 2020-10-12 04:51:50 > how do you activate outlines on builds btw?
<@569691841360953352> alt+f3
general 2020-10-12 04:52:13 If that don't work use alt+f4
general 2020-10-12 04:53:12 Tbh I just 0.75 and 0.5 cylinders
general 2020-10-12 04:53:38 And more round blocks
general 2020-10-12 04:53:41 Like
general 2020-10-12 04:53:46 Half ball
general 2020-10-12 04:53:48 But split
general 2020-10-12 04:53:54 Into 8 pieces
general 2020-10-12 04:57:18 https://youtu.be/gW59byeTHss only choice i have is using this
general 2020-10-12 04:57:24 But gross rockets
general 2020-10-12 04:57:31 🤢
general 2020-10-12 04:57:42 No.
general 2020-10-12 04:59:20 You know what rickje needs to add?
general 2020-10-12 04:59:23 Rotors
general 2020-10-12 04:59:28 And rotor shafts
general 2020-10-12 04:59:29 😎
general 2020-10-12 04:59:35 No
general 2020-10-12 04:59:37 Vip is my gf
general 2020-10-12 05:21:51 https://youtu.be/EBa-EKkAbwc how tf does this fly so smoothly without a tail rotor
general 2020-10-12 05:22:36 <@296280922771292170>  fake tail rotor
general 2020-10-12 05:23:03 In the body?
general 2020-10-12 05:23:57 Damn when am I gonna see a realistic heli that doesn't have a huge rotor system
general 2020-10-12 05:24:59 Its either rocket props or a whatever tf this is https://youtu.be/Fynwpj7XDrw
general 2020-10-12 05:25:28 Guess rocket prop is my best choice
general 2020-10-12 05:25:58 Swashplates are easy to make
general 2020-10-12 05:26:03 I just need a small one....
general 2020-10-12 05:26:06 Which is cancer
general 2020-10-12 05:26:27 Never seen a 3x3 swashplate that doesn't use rockets
general 2020-10-12 05:26:36 Bro motor lock on Swashplate?
general 2020-10-12 05:26:39 Are you dumb?
general 2020-10-12 05:27:03 We won't be able to make small swashpaltes till bearings are added
general 2020-10-12 05:27:33 Lol I've never seen a 3x3 swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:27:42 Where
general 2020-10-12 05:27:57 Funyy thing is
general 2020-10-12 05:27:59 You haven't
general 2020-10-12 05:28:10 > just make it longer : ^ )
<@296280922771292170>  wdym make it longer
general 2020-10-12 05:28:15 <@466793357318815744>  no, you haven't
general 2020-10-12 05:28:26 You probably think it's a swashplate but it isn't <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:28:40 I know what's possible in pc
general 2020-10-12 05:29:48 The poor kid is probably talking about this
general 2020-10-12 05:29:55 Which isn't a swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:29:58 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:30:36 Is that person in the discord?
general 2020-10-12 05:30:55 The smallest swashplate I've seen is 5x5 which is too big
general 2020-10-12 05:31:14 The guy better not pull up with some rocket rotor
general 2020-10-12 05:31:16 🤢
general 2020-10-12 05:31:37 <@287779983445721088>  night battle?

general 2020-10-12 05:33:33 <@163143541160148992> yroe'uo
general 2020-10-12 05:36:46 <@296280922771292170> still waiting for that 3x3 swashplates
general 2020-10-12 05:37:20 You said you were looking for an image of one?
general 2020-10-12 05:37:34 Yes
general 2020-10-12 05:37:36 😐
general 2020-10-12 05:38:23 Why'd you delete your message
general 2020-10-12 05:38:24 Smh
general 2020-10-12 05:38:46 None of them online
general 2020-10-12 05:38:47 Bruh
general 2020-10-12 05:39:33 > like swashplate can be simple if you know it well but either way it stills take up 90% of your heli so ruins the overall design
<@584325543172898826>  finally someone that understands
general 2020-10-12 05:39:44 <@466793357318815744>  send
general 2020-10-12 05:39:58 Let's see these "swashplates"
general 2020-10-12 05:40:22 They all use rockets man
general 2020-10-12 05:40:26 I already told you
general 2020-10-12 05:40:29 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:40:33 They do
general 2020-10-12 05:40:46 If it use rockets to turn
general 2020-10-12 05:40:48 Its not a swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:40:51 🤢
general 2020-10-12 05:41:32 <@466793357318815744>  4th one also isn't a swashplate cant turn right or left
general 2020-10-12 05:41:34 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:41:51 The 3rd one also uses rockets
general 2020-10-12 05:41:57 You failed<:pain:644301805534183464> <:pain:644301805534183464> <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-10-12 05:42:18 Bro I legit saw it on YouTube
general 2020-10-12 05:43:18 Yes, yes I did
general 2020-10-12 05:43:20 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:43:22 https://youtu.be/gW59byeTHss
general 2020-10-12 05:43:41 It is
general 2020-10-12 05:43:46 🤢
general 2020-10-12 05:43:55 Okay youre a sped
general 2020-10-12 05:44:16 I'm saying its the same "swashplate"
general 2020-10-12 05:44:45 Thing you kids aren't understanding is
general 2020-10-12 05:45:10 If it uses rockets, propeller, jets etc to turn its not a swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:45:35 Literally none of the images sent are swashplates
general 2020-10-12 05:45:52 Like I said sped
general 2020-10-12 05:45:59 Making a 3x3 swashplate isn't possible
general 2020-10-12 05:46:13 Making a swashplate is easy
general 2020-10-12 05:46:18 But making it 3x3?
general 2020-10-12 05:46:20 Not possible
general 2020-10-12 05:46:38 > Idk this guy calling me a sped after I tried to be helpful
<@466793357318815744>  because none of the images you sent are swashplates<:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2020-10-12 05:47:08 > swashplate hard to make compact and still retain all functions of irl swashplates
<@430394898726780940>  thats what I've been trying to say but they don't understand
general 2020-10-12 05:47:30 If it loses any function than its no longer a swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:47:50 Yeah let's just call it semi swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:47:53 Yes
general 2020-10-12 05:47:55 Thats the word
general 2020-10-12 05:47:59 I was about to type that
general 2020-10-12 05:48:28 Its not possible to make a 3x3 swashplate but a pseudo swashplate?
general 2020-10-12 05:48:37 Of coures!
general 2020-10-12 05:48:47 <@582834773773254656>  nah
general 2020-10-12 05:48:59 > a 3x3 swashplate would just be insanely tall
<@722974995118162041>  yes
general 2020-10-12 05:49:03 Making it
general 2020-10-12 05:49:05 No longer
general 2020-10-12 05:49:06 3x3
general 2020-10-12 05:49:18 The smallest swashplate I've seen was 5x5
general 2020-10-12 05:49:52 3x3 isn't possible,  it would just be a pseudo swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:50:07 Thats a pseudo swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:51:16 A 3x3 swashplate would be possible if a bearing like block was added
general 2020-10-12 05:51:52 1 blade rotor?? What is this monstrosity
general 2020-10-12 05:52:33 Ni
general 2020-10-12 05:52:35 No
general 2020-10-12 05:52:45 That would be pseudo swashplate
general 2020-10-12 05:52:52 Okay feel free to waste your time
general 2020-10-12 05:56:00 > but with only 2 rotorblades i could probably do 3x3
<@722974995118162041> thought we made it clear smallest you could go is 5x5
general 2020-10-12 05:56:04 But I mean
general 2020-10-12 05:56:13 Feel free to motorlock
general 2020-10-12 05:56:22 Let's see how glitch it gets
general 2020-10-12 05:56:39 <@347182144873037824>  how many rotors you have
general 2020-10-12 05:56:43 Send screenshot
general 2020-10-12 05:57:06 Add tail rotor <@347182144873037824>
general 2020-10-12 05:57:17 Okay
general 2020-10-12 05:57:23 Than you're fucked
general 2020-10-12 05:57:34 Cause rickje doesn't make motors spin faster
general 2020-10-12 05:57:35 😎
general 2020-10-12 06:00:06 <@347182144873037824>  send screenshot

general 2020-10-12 06:00:54 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-10-12 06:02:37 Until bearings are added
general 2020-10-12 06:02:44 3x3 swashplate isn't possible
general 2020-10-12 06:02:46 😎

general 2020-10-14 20:55:36 nope
general 2020-10-14 20:55:50 you need angled motor lock to make the m1a2 turret
general 2020-10-14 20:56:39 This is the most accurate m1a2 in pcc so far <@658140951273013248>

general 2020-10-26 06:48:00 > it would function better as an axe than a sword
<@163143541160148992> thats literally how he uses it
general 2020-10-26 06:48:18 Thats why they recommended an axe for him but he didn't want it
general 2020-10-26 06:49:12 Only skinny people could relate
general 2020-10-26 06:49:51 > and you would either need to have the strength to become your own trebuchet in order to cut a limb from a dragon off using that sword, or you would need to pin the dragon down and spend a couple of hours slowly decapitating it
<@163143541160148992>  the sword's size is questioned by every other character in the anime
general 2020-10-26 06:50:00 Only guts is able to use it
general 2020-10-26 06:50:07 He's just different i guess
general 2020-10-26 06:52:36 > if he can use that he might as well just wield a giant axe instead of a giant club that's short of sharp
<@163143541160148992>  I think its because the sword is the only thing that's able to damage the God hand
general 2020-10-26 06:53:55 > i dont want to discuss anime lore

general 2020-11-23 04:01:32 This doesn't work against smart players
general 2020-11-23 04:01:36 They turn away
general 2020-11-23 04:02:14 I don't know why people use the p47, p38 does the same thing but way better
general 2020-11-23 04:02:26 <@265819387498332160> sure, tomorrow good
general 2020-11-23 04:02:43 My kd with the p38 is above 2 but below 1 with every other plane
general 2020-11-23 04:02:47 P38 is insane
general 2020-11-23 04:03:25 P38 very op
general 2020-11-23 04:03:37 Who turns fight with p38?
general 2020-11-23 04:03:44 Youre not supposed to play it like that
general 2020-11-23 04:04:07 Lol its good with that wdym
general 2020-11-23 04:04:17 I can easily kill 109 in p38
general 2020-11-23 04:04:23 But I struggle in p51
general 2020-11-23 04:05:06 > planes can energy trap you, it is very vulnerable to energy traps
<@265819387498332160>  the only thing that has killed me 1 on 1 in the p38 is a yak
general 2020-11-23 04:05:45 Yak 9 fucking op, they can ram you and still survive
general 2020-11-23 04:06:30 Why would you scissor in p38??
general 2020-11-23 04:06:49 Play it like a p47 with more accuracy
general 2020-11-23 04:07:56 Best part of the p38 is its 20mm and tail
general 2020-11-23 04:08:24 I'll show video of how I play p38
general 2020-11-23 04:08:28 Tomorrow
general 2020-11-23 04:08:54 I never try to dogfight in it
general 2020-11-23 04:09:09 Its always a boom and zoom, get 3km away, turn back and repeat
general 2020-11-23 04:09:33 I get killed by aa more than fighters In the p38<:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-11-23 04:10:34 > this is the head on merge with ta-152H, notice the vertical turn at the merge

general 2020-11-23 20:26:20 f4u just has trash climb
general 2020-11-23 20:27:11 im pretty sure f4u has better roll than all p51
general 2020-11-23 20:27:36 so its just better roll, take off run, and guns

general 2020-11-26 08:58:36 The physics of the rockets is easily exploitable

<@311638025308209154> why does it matter? The tanks armor overall is shit
general 2020-11-26 17:06:14 Its only good because of stealth <@311638025308209154>
general 2020-11-26 17:06:32 And its not detected by thermals

general 2020-11-26 17:22:47 > heavy tank > light tank
<@538103285412921365> bro why is this even an argument
general 2020-11-26 17:22:57 It really doesn't matter who has armor anymore
general 2020-11-26 17:23:04 Its all about guns and atgms
general 2020-11-26 17:23:26 There's a weight limit to tanks
general 2020-11-26 17:23:40 I'd prefer light tank as you can equip it with more
general 2020-11-26 17:23:57 Tanks are all long rang in the modern age
general 2020-11-26 17:24:50 Armor has become useless in a way because the penetration of guns increases and armor doesn't seem to increase just as well because of weight limits
general 2020-11-26 17:25:13 > Every modern tank looks the same
<@456226577798135808>  of course they do
general 2020-11-26 17:25:32 Its the best design.Tanks are almost useless in the moderan age
general 2020-11-26 17:25:51 They can easily be  destroyed by an atgm
general 2020-11-26 17:26:18 Why have something slow amd heavy ver something with the same gun but faster?
general 2020-11-26 17:26:39 *close range*
general 2020-11-26 17:26:49 You need to do Research on modern tanks
general 2020-11-26 17:27:43 I dlnt think close range tanks exist
general 2020-11-26 17:27:59 Most encounters are over multiple kilometers
general 2020-11-26 17:28:24 Modern tanks are just snipers 😏
general 2020-11-26 17:29:53 Why tf are you talking about 20th century tanks?

<@389756407483990028> pretty good for its br
general 2020-11-26 18:21:43 Just boom and zoom
general 2020-11-26 18:21:47 Stay under 5k alt
general 2020-11-26 18:22:04 Do not dog fight in it
general 2020-11-26 18:22:38 Eventho they have the same model the p39 is nothing like a p63
general 2020-11-26 18:22:48 Even the p47 outturns it<:PogU:670373666164572172>
general 2020-11-26 18:23:20 But yeah just play it like a p47 that doesn't turn
general 2020-11-26 18:23:47 Itbdoes at hight alt <@659802570474258500>
general 2020-11-26 18:24:01 The p39 is low br p47
general 2020-11-26 18:24:26 The p39 is only good for its fuselage strength and firepower
general 2020-11-26 18:24:35 Pretty much you want to go head on it with it
general 2020-11-26 18:25:06 The p39 has six .50 cal?

general 2020-11-26 18:28:36 Thats good
general 2020-11-26 18:28:54 1 second of turn time makes a huge difference
general 2020-11-26 18:30:14 Turn times in plane stats aren't accurate because planes turn better at different speeds
general 2020-11-26 18:30:21 And alts

general 2020-11-26 18:33:14 I don't ever see myself losing to a p51 in it
general 2020-11-26 18:33:50 Shut up nerd the sb2c-4 is the best fighter
general 2020-11-26 18:33:58 > dude the Bf 109 G 2 has 23m/s climb rate

general 2020-11-26 18:34:02 Thats op af
general 2020-11-26 18:34:10 Thats half of 7.7 jets
general 2020-11-26 18:34:38 Germany is only good for 109
general 2020-11-26 18:34:48 And ta152
general 2020-11-26 18:34:55 Everything else is okay
general 2020-11-26 18:35:10 > I dont get why people say the 109 is op
<@437078588701933568> good turn and climb
general 2020-11-26 18:36:20 Bro the p38 is the best turn fighter

general 2020-11-26 18:36:58 I don't know how people die in the me 264
general 2020-11-26 18:37:06 It has cannons and good climb for a bomber
general 2020-11-26 18:37:14 Just go to 6.5k
general 2020-11-26 18:37:27 The p61 is the only viable counter
general 2020-11-26 18:38:12 I would say p38 andbp51 but it would already have bombed before they get to that alt
general 2020-11-26 18:38:27 P38 is good at everything but speed
general 2020-11-26 18:38:39 Yes
general 2020-11-26 18:38:42 P38 bad dive
general 2020-11-26 18:38:49 Its breaks at 750
general 2020-11-26 18:39:17 Its slower than russians and germans but faster than spitfires
general 2020-11-26 18:40:41 American attackers are eh
general 2020-11-26 18:40:51 They can hold their own but aren't good at high alts
general 2020-11-26 18:41:09 Only good attacker against fighters is p61 and maybe a26

general 2021-10-10 23:08:10 it happened to my Xbox controllers but I still had fun?
general 2021-10-10 23:08:11 lol
general 2021-10-10 23:08:27 none?
general 2021-10-10 23:08:34 I dont like cheated

general 2021-10-10 23:09:30 <@301734591717441547>  answer this, can you play switch games on. a phone?
general 2021-10-10 23:09:42 well its quite limited so still a win
general 2021-10-10 23:09:50 and a flex
general 2021-10-10 23:10:19 that died a couple weeks after releasing
general 2021-10-10 23:11:48 can't wait to play pokemon legends arceus on my birthday
general 2021-10-11 14:27:48 crazy, didn't ask chump<:trollpeter:763045071460237322>
creations-chat 2021-10-14 15:55:32 I never left and I was never negative but go on chump, I gave genuine feedback when people ask, you think im going to message every person that has a build downvoted by me? no they have to ask me first
also to add just because I have high standards doesn't mean I'm a "jerk" 
setting high standards makes the rest of the community want to improve and make pog builds. Irl is set high standards on myself which is why I improved so much physically and mentally.
I only get toxic when you get toxic first, if you genuinely want feedback dm and don't be a jerk about it
creations-chat 2021-10-14 16:06:59 also who is da hars, I see people mention me and him and him 24/7
creations-chat 2021-10-14 16:10:03 <@283029601645625354>  cool build poob
creations-chat 2021-10-14 16:13:00 I just realized da hars adopted my ideals but became corrupted and toxic😟
pretty sure he became toxic because a select few would bully him about his build's colors and excessive motorlock
general 2021-10-14 16:15:03 <@163143541160148992>  what's up stinky, missed me?

general 2021-12-05 02:49:55 hi stinky people
general 2021-12-06 15:15:06 LETS GO BATTLE BOT TOURNAMENT
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 15:15:54 no. its just gonna be more fun
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 15:15:57 no one shots
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 15:16:16 very cool plane but would be a pain to build in pc
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 15:16:59 I never made a bottle bot because they're obsolete in pc pvp cause everyone uses shredders and planes
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 15:17:11 but because of this tournament I'm looking forward to it
general 2021-12-06 15:18:31 stop leaking your bottle bots, people will find ways to counter
general 2021-12-06 15:19:33 wait so can we motors for wheels?
general 2021-12-06 15:28:41 look forward to this battle bot tournament
general 2021-12-06 15:29:02 watch some white name win with a pink car covered in spikes
general 2021-12-06 15:36:30 first battle bot already broke a rule💀
general 2021-12-06 15:36:35 only 15 cutters
general 2021-12-06 15:37:36 <#621452102618578964>
general 2021-12-06 15:44:03 no rockets
general 2021-12-06 15:44:46 they deleted your build because it has rockets!
general 2021-12-06 15:44:50 no rockets!
general 2021-12-06 15:44:54 can you read!
general 2021-12-06 15:44:56 <:nerddroid:823697821436870657>
general 2021-12-06 15:45:40 rockets
general 2021-12-06 15:47:08 use ballast blocks
general 2021-12-06 15:47:27 also I'm glass they banned a lot of stuff
general 2021-12-06 15:47:48 thats bad
general 2021-12-06 15:47:51 its gonna add lift
general 2021-12-06 15:48:09 if someone throws your build into the air its over
general 2021-12-06 15:48:21 no pistons tho?
general 2021-12-06 15:48:58 ballast blocks are better, wings do slow you down but they make it easier to fling you
general 2021-12-06 15:49:07 nah the rules are perfect
general 2021-12-06 15:49:25 yes but not nearly as much as wings
general 2021-12-06 15:49:44 this break cutter limit rule
general 2021-12-06 15:49:51 no buddy they dont
general 2021-12-06 15:50:06 you probably put max weight<:bruh:876908593243385897>
general 2021-12-06 15:50:36 oh so its saws are useless???
general 2021-12-06 15:50:48 LOL
general 2021-12-06 15:50:52 talk about useless weight
general 2021-12-06 15:51:01 breaking those would be eas
general 2021-12-06 15:53:39 I wonder how whips would work on battle bots😏
general 2021-12-06 15:54:33 Hella damage
general 2021-12-06 15:54:50 oh God
general 2021-12-06 15:54:54 I'm scared of those
general 2021-12-06 15:55:12 this is pretty much the best,way to win
general 2021-12-06 15:56:04 I can make one that one shots with 9 😏
general 2021-12-06 15:56:44 who said it was a hammer<:anger:816163020064423946>
general 2021-12-06 15:56:58 hammers are useless without rockets
general 2021-12-06 15:58:57 I know I'm not gonna win as I dont have time to experiment with Design but im definitely coming in top 10
general 2021-12-06 15:59:40 they should've never allowed motor lock
general 2021-12-06 15:59:46 that allows for some op builds
general 2021-12-06 16:02:08 <@314383347214319616>  hey I just wanna be clear.  I see that we can't use motorlock for layers armor but we can use it to extend past the build limit. does this mean we can use motor lock to make mechanisms on our build more compact for no?
general 2021-12-06 16:02:32 if I were you guys I would use very little motor lock
general 2021-12-06 16:02:38 they break one lock and it's over
general 2021-12-06 16:03:09 huh?
general 2021-12-06 16:03:52 can we use it to make weapons?
general 2021-12-06 16:04:35 bet<:chadmuslim:896802356887425095>
general 2021-12-06 16:04:46 time to one shot everyone's bot
general 2021-12-06 16:05:09 but sadly I have review motorlocking because I haven't played pc in months
general 2021-12-06 16:05:13 yea
general 2021-12-06 16:05:41 probably not allowed cause event robux item

general 2021-12-06 16:10:52 yes

general 2021-12-06 16:11:41 I'm saying bro
general 2021-12-06 16:11:58 throwing is allowed without using glitches
general 2021-12-06 16:12:05 I think its allowed
general 2021-12-06 16:12:10 they might wanna change that
general 2021-12-06 16:12:20 cause literally just make your build heavy and spin
general 2021-12-06 16:12:42 True
general 2021-12-06 16:13:19 this is a bery ineffective battlebot
general 2021-12-06 16:13:26 has literally no weapons
general 2021-12-06 17:03:06 <@718409831639154718>  cringe you

general 2021-12-06 19:00:13 <@314383347214319616>  ban wings for the tournament? ban flinging into space? (flipping vehicles should be allowed but shooting them 1000 meters into space shouldn't be allowed)
general 2021-12-06 19:05:43 90% of the battlebots gonna be a lil car with a giant spinning blade...

general 2021-12-11 00:42:13 <@393858481268064266>  dont get cocky kid
general 2021-12-11 00:42:19 we hate children like you
general 2021-12-11 00:46:26 <@393858481268064266>  and this is why you don't get cocky

general 2021-12-11 01:11:49 dont be cocky bro<:roar:856960143845228554>
general 2021-12-11 01:12:05 I know how to counter your bot
general 2021-12-11 01:12:16 but it'd be a waste of time
general 2021-12-11 01:12:31 horizontal switch in saws
general 2021-12-11 01:12:45 with big chassis
general 2021-12-11 01:12:58 they are tho
general 2021-12-11 01:13:17 you have a weapon the swings down, switch saws would trap the hammer and cut it off
general 2021-12-11 01:13:39 but it would only work if they made it the same size of your bot
general 2021-12-11 01:13:57 crushing pressure isn't a thing<:whatthe:508096211002064896>
general 2021-12-11 01:14:09 with switch in saws?
general 2021-12-11 01:14:11 no
general 2021-12-11 01:14:24 bro the blue one and zebra are 2 times smaller than you
general 2021-12-11 01:15:00 fat bot with switch in saws counters you <:roar:856960143845228554>
general 2021-12-11 01:15:19 if tall enough to be able to reach hammer
general 2021-12-11 01:15:21 easy win
general 2021-12-11 01:15:27 I said fat bot
general 2021-12-11 01:16:04 no?
general 2021-12-11 01:16:20 what are you saying yo<:bruh:876908593243385897>

general 2021-12-11 01:17:18 might make it to ruin this man's carrier
general 2021-12-11 01:17:44 they do the same thing tho
general 2021-12-11 01:17:50 thats why they're called switch in
general 2021-12-11 01:18:00 well of course

"Update note
I keep seeing this come up, you can only choose from 1 of the 3 classes listed, and you have to follow the restrictions in the class.

you can now use 2 propellers extra ONLY for lifting and descending" 
just use wings

events-chat 2022-02-22 20:52:33 <@603974932585644043> okay no more haha moment, you seriously need to reconsider making the torpedoes guided, they're extremely annoying to balance and make accurate. literally making it travel in a straight line is the most annoying thing ever, they're also so easy to dodge, this isn't fleet battles where you can only move horizontally, this is in the air where ships can move vertically. Unguided torpedoes are extremely obsolete in this kind of event, I doubt people would pick it over the gun ship or destroyer. 
if you think they'd be op if they were guided just add some restrictions,  2 unguided torpedoes is comparable to a baby when it comes to threat level in a sky battle
plane crazy physics are also stupid, yeah a cutter on the tip is cool but half the time it'll just bounce off with only destroying one block
events-chat 2022-02-22 20:57:38 oh I didn't know the dreadnought was slow, nvm<:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-23 00:59:59 <@!603974932585644043>  just to make things clear, if my build fills whole plot but when spawned its 5x5x5, is that not allowed?
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:00:29 is it allowed or not
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:01:07 isnt rbk black?
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:02:33 that still doesnt answr my question
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:03:23 my build is 30x26x13 in build mode, when i spawn its 30x17x13  the reason its 26 is cause of motorlock tower
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:04:10 why tho?
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:04:32 it fits the limits when spawned in, give me a good fucking reason why thats not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:05:32 dont give me some "people dont know how to motorlock bs" WHY EVEN ALLOWED MOTORLOCK THEN
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:06:03 please get in vc or some man holy shit you dont get what im saying
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:07:00 no its not
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:07:17 shep is giving a stupid excuse on why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:08:07 why does it matter if it exceeds in build mode IF IT FITS IN SPAWN MODE 
answer man
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:08:34 like wtf is this? this isnt even an answer
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:16:43 its all good  its just that i dont understand why it isnt allowed, i think youre confused on what we're talking about so ill send an image of what we mean
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:18:25 what channel
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:18:50 no dont
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:19:10 allow it cause its dumb to not allow it
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:19:49 this is what we're talking about
okay so jim made build that goes past 50 block  as seen in this image
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:11 but when he spawns it in its 2x3
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:32 shep told him its not allowed even tho it fits the limit when spawned
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:52 give me a valid reason why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:22:24 <@!603974932585644043>  what do you think about his build? would it be allowed or no
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:09 <@!466793357318815744>  why is my build not allowed<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:34 you still havent provided a reason on why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:57 no, you havent.
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:25:36 thats still not a reason on why its not allowed man
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:26:20 so its not allowed because its a more dense build? you know how stupid that sounds? thats legit what motorlock is my guy
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:27:54 then say no motorlock at all!
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:28:41 no because i could motorlock within the limit and make my build just as dense!! so your rule is stupid!1
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:29:45 yeah sorry because this legit has never been said in an event before
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:30:02 youre the only person to come up with that stupid ass rule

will you pick like 1-2 from each class or will it just be selected without caring about the airship class
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:02 so class doesn't matter?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:35 oh okay so for example 
2 gunship 
1 destroyer and 1 torpedo bomber per team?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:54 yeah thats probably the lowest chance of being selected cause everyone is making them
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:17:10 I'll probably be the only person with torpedo bomber💀
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:18:12 but i thought it was 4v4+cruiser and dreadnought

events-chat 2022-02-24 03:04:15 you can make them however you want just can't be guided
reason is the dreadnought goes like 75 speed
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:04:36 its a good thing they made is unguided as mime can literally one-shot it

events-chat 2022-02-24 03:13:48 <@603974932585644043>  are we allowed to use rocket or jet engine in torpedoes? it doesn't specify
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:15:24 its kind of impossible to make them go past 350 speed with only props
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:17:31 my missile could one-shot that
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:32:50 it does matter, you're gonna need accurate torpedoes for this battle, trust me
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:35:23 if your torpedo can't fly in a straight line across the map its harmless
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:35:41 sure
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:36:02 can it travel tho?
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:37:26 torpedoes can go at 500 speed, and again they're meant to target the dreadnought <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:37:53 I guess
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:38:18 shep hasn't answered, he said max speed they can go is 500 but only jet engine+ can go that fast
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:38:52 but anyways gl against cluster bomber
