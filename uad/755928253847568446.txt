[Timer Blocks for PC2]
[CONFIGURABLE]
The Timer Block would be a block that has 2 configurable keybinds and a time delay slider from 0.1 to 10 seconds and a button labeled hold. One of the keybinds is the input which activates the timer, then the block waits however long you put on the time delay slider, then it presses or holds (for 3 seconds) the other keybind depending if you pressed the button labled hold. This would help in non-pvp, ex: rocket stages breaking off at certain sections, auto decontamination chamber, ect. And it could be used in pvp, ex: auto delayed armor piercing bombs, motorlock the plane fold the wings out to prep for takeoff, etc.
[OTHER INFORMATION]
Would work well with previous idea submittion:
