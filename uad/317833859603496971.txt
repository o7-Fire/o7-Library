creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:26:47 i finally figured out that you need to turn on the lock option for motors to lock them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:27:03 it took me way too long
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:25:52 holy hell
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:26:22 So you were making toxic remarks and just acting all puffed up about slaughtering an entire lobby
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:26:42 like Jesus Christ man
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:27:12 you were going off on a kid about his build being trash

plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:29:00 and that one guy you literally hammered for having a weirdly shaped truck
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:30:31 no but I don‚Äôt expect for someone to get ridiculed for their builds or just being a general nousance for no reason at all from a sweat
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 04:32:25 ayo bet cause id rather not be in a server with another person who can‚Äôt take an insult

creations-chat 2020-10-12 01:54:03 <@!593882288954146836> u forgot to paint the back
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:00:51 pro tip for shredders:
get a bigger shredder
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:01:37 tiny mach 2 planes and shredders are the only things that suck in this game
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:21 no
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:44 its not the cutters, its the weird self controllable shredder design
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:03:02 **if cutters are removed people are just going to replace the cutters with rockets on shredders**
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:03:18 its not that hard to realise
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:03:33 its the design that needs to be removed
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:03:52 add more then come back
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:11:17 no the boat is too thin
general 2020-10-12 02:25:00 the raid
creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:06:49 ok im sorry
creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:07:05 but whose hand is that round to fit into a grip like that
creations-chat 2020-10-12 04:07:32 im the one guy who screwed up the poll
creations-chat 2020-10-12 04:11:25 bro what is that nose
creations-chat 2020-10-12 05:26:36 if you were to go from 60 to 0 in that thing it would do a front flip
creations-chat 2020-10-12 05:47:30 its not the graphics its the horrible paint job
creations-chat 2020-10-12 05:47:57 its trying to go for 3 different camos and it just ended up looking horrible
general 2020-10-12 17:27:12 you already banned him
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:12:54 imo those tracks are too wide
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:08:44 so this is the easiest way to make suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:09:00 ill send a pic
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:13:08 <@!261673812821671946>
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:13:51 so it works like a tank
but it has the function of suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:15:10 connect the boddy bit of suspension to the chassis and put 1x.9 pieces above it to encase the piston and connect the top of the piston to the chassis aswell
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:15:47 super compact, works good, and it gets rid of that wobbly stuff in those massive suspension builds that is easily avoidable
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:17:05 although it doesnt have the best suspension power since it can only go over a terrain with a height difference of 2 units before it starts to go airborne over hills
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:17:54 but imo its the best form of suspenesion because of how compact it is
just uh, set the pistons to toggle and make the activation key "W"
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:18:10 no generally its not
its too loose on its own
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:19:06 well because if the chassis is too heavy then the suspension doesnt work effectively
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:19:33 the pistons create a pull on the suspension so they work better, since they will almost never go to their full length or contraction
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:19:57 it makes the upward force the same if not more than the downward force, keeping it in the middle where it should be
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:20:15 just read what i said earlier
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:21:23 > connect the boddy bit of suspension to the chassis and put 1x.9 pieces above it to encase the piston and connect the top of the piston to the chassis aswell
specifically this part and the image
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:22:13 only use it for offroad vehicles though
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:22:32 since it greatly reduces the effectiveness of accuracy on flat surfaces
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:22:48 because of the force from the increase and decrease in acceleration
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:24:17 heres a better pic, orange bits are where you want to connect it to the chassis and only on the orange blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:25:04 suspension is too complicated in this game
this is easier
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:25:39 1.5 distance and 0 force
make it a toggle and set the toggle key to W
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:26:24 should look like this
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:26:41 dont make it 2 or else itll clip into the suspension and it gets wack
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:30:00 cause ur lambo looks like this
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:31:14 like you learned to motorlock good, but you havent learned how to build good with a motorlock
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:31:30 motorlock
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:32:17 ok then show me the build on the build plate
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:32:34 he had to have motorlocked
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:33:03 did you just delete all of the motors
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:33:51 lmaoooooo
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:34:18 now that i see it there are so many locked motors

creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:59:35 i want downvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:59:51 no
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:05:26 i left

creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:13 nerf gatling gun
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:36 that thing was so bad, it could get through 10 rounds in 20 seconds
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:26:04 youd pull out the rhino and people would actually run
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:26:20 the rhino was the better version of that since it rarely jammed and just ate bullets
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:26:52 if the rhino did jam aswell it was super easy to unjam it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:27:08 since the hatches just popped open
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:27:43 <@!488078218646257695> bigger catapiller wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:28:00 dude that thing was insane cause of the rpm
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:28:16 rhino
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:28:32 well actually
probably vuclan
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:28:59 since a belt fed gun would be easier than a drum fed
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:30:33 the only thing good about the vulcan were the bullets
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:30:49 since those things had the essense of a pvc dodgeball compacted into a nerf dart
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:34:02 the rhino, the zombie strike 2 shot pistol, and the modulus were my go-to nerf guns
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:35:00 we just outgrew nerf guns
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:35:40 the charm wore off and it wasnt fun anymore cause we were too big to make forts out of pillows and blankets cause we didnt have enough materials, not to mention we would always need to buy more nerf darts
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:37:34 everyone i know just gave away their nerf guns or sold them
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:48:15 ok but is that compatable with every nerf dart
no, no it is not

creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:20:25 cant
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:20:41 the dump is too heavy and the suspension will literally clip into the chassis
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:21:03 ive tried it and theres like 50 ballast beams at max density
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:22:22 i mean just visually wise
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:22:39 since it can offroad already
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:24:07 1) i dont have enough room for axels since theyd go right through the area where the motors are for the bucket and 2) why do i need suspension on a dump that can offroad already
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:41:55 <@!484529511468236802> cringe
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:44:19 ok but is it practical
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:44:43 bruh it can barely get over the railroad tracks
creations-chat 2020-10-13 19:46:50 isnt the whole point of a suspension build meant to get over rough terrain
its meant to look practical, not nice

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:53:30 motorlock is for vertical features
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:53:37 and even if you get it sideways
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:53:52 yes but heres my point
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:53:56 if you can motorlock sideways
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:54:01 why doesnt it compact all into 1 block

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:57:26 why
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:57:41 yes but if you motorlock it
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 01:57:44 it should be in 1 unit

creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:36:24 and a better pallet

creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:47:28 1) color pallet is ass
2) the front is wack, no lip on the sides its just a barrel of a nose
and 3) theres way too many wedges that just make it too round from the body to the wings
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:48:31 see this is why the slowmode is at 1 minute
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:49:32 <@!720751430595772418> make the lights round by using half cyllenders and supports on the back

creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:59:45 <@456226577798135808> cringe, use cutters
creations-chat 2020-10-17 20:00:51 cutters work better at higher velocities, plus there isnt any targetting system that can tell you where something will land based on its trajectory so id say use cutters

cutters > bombs
creations-chat 2020-10-17 20:01:55 plus that plane is just too much of an eye sore for the bombs to be showcased on
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 20:03:50 ayo is there a way to make this guy stop lagging the server other than blacklist cutting

help 2020-10-21 00:25:22 <@!720751430595772418> uhhhhh so just start off with a regular ship hull but make curves to a smooth base, i would suggets making the runway platform before you make the hull
help 2020-10-21 00:27:42 the only tips i have are dont use wedges with the flow of the hull, its a lot easier to get a nice shape when wedges are placed perpendicular to the front of the ship
help 2020-10-21 00:28:20 it makes the ship look better

creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:40:53 is there a way to make a motorlock tower lock all down into 1 block
general 2020-10-22 17:27:27 <@!730808827234091041> ok so let me explain this again since your thick skull doesnt understand, you straight up harassed a kid for like 10 minutes straight about how his builds were trash and then went on a power high and spawn killed everyone in the lobby and bragged about it saying everyone was trash because you were just camping
general 2020-10-22 17:28:44 yes because you were straight up going apeshit crazy over killing some people and saying "ur bad lmao" "stop playing ur bad"
general 2020-10-22 17:29:36 1) you said a lot more than that and 2) how is being toxic an advantage
general 2020-10-22 17:29:52 like you were the equivalent of the chernobyl meltdown in chat
general 2020-10-22 17:30:09 and then proceeded to act like you werent toxic
general 2020-10-22 17:31:07 no but harassing a kid for 10 minutes straight about how your builds are better than his and he should quit is another level of toxic
general 2020-10-22 17:31:35 bruh what rational person screenshots a chat
general 2020-10-22 17:31:45 like how insecure are you
general 2020-10-22 17:31:54 to screenshot a chat so you can argue about it on discord

general 2020-10-22 17:34:58 mfw this dude brings up chats about him being toxic over 3 weeks ago to feed his superiority complex
general 2020-10-22 17:35:44 you literally harassed a kid for 10 minutes straight about how his builds werent as good as yours
general 2020-10-22 17:36:00 and then went on a power high saying "youre bad, you should quit" to the rest of the server
general 2020-10-22 17:36:21 that doesnt mean you should blast a kid until they leave about how theyre not some basement dweller like you

creations-chat 2020-10-27 12:24:52 <@!527653676022628353> use blue and turquoise for highlights on the main deck and it will look a lot better, along with wood, why havent i said that

general 2020-10-28 14:05:50 war thunder is overrated change my mind
general 2020-10-28 14:07:30 yea especially that gaijin is p2w heavy that more than 90% of their players that have hit their 30 day retention mark have paid atleast $5 for a f2p game
general 2020-10-28 14:08:03 wt is more p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:08:06 by far
general 2020-10-28 14:08:29 the fact that you need to grind out like 80 hours of play time just to rank up for a high tier tank
general 2020-10-28 14:08:44 WoT was sort of p2w but its not nearly as bad a gaijin
general 2020-10-28 14:08:58 wt is p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:09:22 the fact that they give you stored xp that you can only get from buying currency
general 2020-10-28 14:09:37 or the fact they have a literal tree for p2w players for each branch of every vehicle type
general 2020-10-28 14:10:05 or that premium vehicles are significantly better than normal ones and they put you in lobbies with lower tiered players
general 2020-10-28 14:10:24 the fact some people can straight up skip grinding by buying the highest tier tank
general 2020-10-28 14:10:59 yes it is
general 2020-10-28 14:11:05 have you played games like robocraft
general 2020-10-28 14:11:07 thats not p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:11:11 thats the best example
general 2020-10-28 14:11:14 of a non-p2w game
general 2020-10-28 14:11:17 thats free to play
general 2020-10-28 14:11:58 wt is p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:12:03 look at every other game by gaijin
general 2020-10-28 14:12:05 crossout
general 2020-10-28 14:12:07 best example
general 2020-10-28 14:12:19 they have packages for blocks n stuff that costs $30+
general 2020-10-28 14:12:36 oh and the packages for war thunder that cost the same as an average award winning game
general 2020-10-28 14:14:42 wt is p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:15:16 p2w vehicles
general 2020-10-28 14:15:25 p2w currency that boosts your ability to compete
general 2020-10-28 14:15:47 the fact that gaijin shoves $60 deals down your throat every time you log in
general 2020-10-28 14:16:20 oh or the fact you can literally skip the entire tech tree to get a tank or plane or ship thats better than every other one in its class
general 2020-10-28 14:16:56 <@!505835349889777685> yes that is
general 2020-10-28 14:21:55 and that progression can be greatly boosted by guess how
general 2020-10-28 14:21:56 paying
general 2020-10-28 14:22:11 no game
general 2020-10-28 14:22:25 should make you dump 500+ hours just for a top tier line up
general 2020-10-28 14:22:39 making a good game
general 2020-10-28 14:22:56 the gameplay is good
general 2020-10-28 14:23:03 the mechanics being so p2w based
general 2020-10-28 14:23:07 is the problem
general 2020-10-28 14:23:54 you literally called a kids builds shit for 10 minutes straight until he left and then you went on a power high
general 2020-10-28 14:24:09 you literally just admitted
general 2020-10-28 14:24:12 also yea im done
general 2020-10-28 14:24:30 war thunder has some areas where its pay 2 win
general 2020-10-28 14:24:38 im not saying the entire top to bottom is pay to win
general 2020-10-28 14:24:55 but an unnerving amount for a p2w game is p2w
general 2020-10-28 14:25:16 a lot of people
general 2020-10-28 14:25:36 no cause then you just get shitfaced by some rich kid whos line up is all p2w vehicles
general 2020-10-28 14:25:50 i did
general 2020-10-28 14:26:09 no it doesnt
general 2020-10-28 14:26:16 no it does not in the slightest lmao
general 2020-10-28 14:26:37 i play with tanks
general 2020-10-28 14:26:58 air combat just takes some plane that can turn on a dot and you win

creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:07:35 heres why i dont like it: 1) there are no tracks, 2) there are no details providing different color to the build 3) the turret corners are in serious need of rework, 4) the entire bottom doesnt even look finished, theres nothing covering it, 4) the back looks empty as hell, 5) where the barrel meets the body is just a massive hole, and finally, just because i say i dont like it doesnt mean you guys need to go on the offensive

general 2021-02-05 07:19:19 tf?
general 2021-02-05 07:20:56 ive suggested 2 things in the past 2 days
general 2021-02-05 07:21:21 one was a 2 flat sided disconnector
and the other was an explosive mg for pvp
general 2021-02-05 07:21:27 how are those worthy of the blacklist
general 2021-02-05 07:23:00 for micro builds
general 2021-02-05 07:23:30 theres a flat part on each side, and the middle connection part falls out
general 2021-02-05 07:23:57 id like it cause you dont have those annoying ass rods sticking out everywhere you disconnected a part
general 2021-02-05 07:27:02 <@!403843930543882241> something like this
general 2021-02-05 07:27:07 middle part drops out
general 2021-02-05 07:27:14 and youre left with the 2 outside bits
general 2021-02-05 07:27:18 no more annoying rods
general 2021-02-05 07:27:48 im sorry is there not a whole ass broken motor locking system with motor 2s or is it patched now
general 2021-02-05 07:28:15 motor 2s
general 2021-02-05 07:28:21 on motorlocked builds
general 2021-02-05 07:28:44 are u guys not getting what im pointing at
general 2021-02-05 07:28:58 motorlocking causes motor 2s to break
general 2021-02-05 07:29:29 so back to micro builds
general 2021-02-05 07:29:33 because i have small stuff
general 2021-02-05 07:29:35 in small areas
general 2021-02-05 07:29:46 its veeeeery annoying to deal with those rods clogging up everything
general 2021-02-05 07:30:12 the missiles on this are a pain in the ass to use
general 2021-02-05 07:30:32 motor 2s completely broke during motorlock so my ejection for them is broken
general 2021-02-05 07:30:37 and i had to revert to disconnectors
general 2021-02-05 07:30:55 dog lmao we had to wait for an entire year for rickje to patch the last bug
general 2021-02-05 07:31:04 its grey
general 2021-02-05 07:31:07 yea
general 2021-02-05 07:32:18 no what im saying is that id rather see a minor addition and let rickje take his time while everything runs smoothly so bigger builds can come back from being broken
general 2021-02-05 07:32:42 like no way do i expect someone with 8k+ builds to fix that issue coming back
general 2021-02-05 07:32:49 doing that sub was one pain in the ass
general 2021-02-05 07:33:47 cool
general 2021-02-05 07:36:59 ay pepsi

creations-chat 2021-02-05 21:25:52 ^
and the fact theres a bunch of random stuff on it that adds nothing to the tank itself other than visuals
also it looks weird seeing the turret being moderately detailed and having the chassis of the tank a literal painted block with a bumped out turret base and thats all
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:40:21 i have yet to have this issue with any of my 5k+ builds with cutters
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:41:03 there is latency for them because of my builds' sizes but they cut
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:41:28 for my largest build the latency is 3 seconds max?
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:41:41 yea unless youre in non-pvp they work fine
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:42:57 also

bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:43:17 if youre doing duels
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:43:22 and you both have large builds
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:43:37 there might be a visual delay significant enough to where it doesnt actually look like youre cutting anything
bug-reports 2021-02-06 01:44:06 even though in reality your screen is visually delayed to what the game is at

creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:00:08 dude literally copied an entire ass jet, changed some minor details and reposted it
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:02:41 did u just literally take his pics and repost them, cause it looks like that, the only noticable difference is the creacks in the cylindrical fuselage and the canopy
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:04:49 theres so much in common, the use of armaments, the literal exact same livery camo, the same paint codes, the same emoji, the same wing angles, the same back wings, the same air scoops, the only differences are the canopies and the fuselage <@!617699741958144020>
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:08:53 im gonna check in photoshop if u used the same paint color as well
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:12:35 its literally the exact same fucking paint too <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
<@!718006867808485447>'s is 197 79 39 and <@!617699741958144020>'s is 195 82 40 +/- 5
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:16:03 <@!718006867808485447>'s color paint in photoshop
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:18:04 <@!617699741958144020> this is urs
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:20:20 the same jet, with a color hue with a less than a 3 count difference across the board, yea "coincidence"
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:23:45 ur trying to cover it up and lie that it was "random", like id let it slide if u gave credit to nam or something, not just "ohh hdur i totaly din copy him"

general 2021-02-12 22:41:48 ok
creations-chat 2021-02-12 22:51:33 which, they all look bad
creations-chat 2021-02-12 22:54:18 so i downvoted yours because, the rims were garbage and inconsistent, the paintjob was way too vibrant and it looked rushed, the trailer looks like it was squished, the trailer has a decidated white space on the side for a decal but there isnt one, this is just to list a few
creations-chat 2021-02-12 22:56:45 85% of creations is just rushed trash made by unranks, 5% is like god tier builds that look decent enough for hof and then the other like 15% is decent builds that need minor fixes but arent horrible
creations-chat 2021-02-12 22:58:51 my opinion that saying ur truck doesnt look good shouldnt mean you need be defensive
creations-chat 2021-02-12 23:01:32 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/809046538583277568
this is a good example of a build that should be appreciated, correct use of motorlock, good paint that fits the game, good overall design its a üëç 

a half baked truck with a squished trailer doesnt really look that good chief

also that rifle looks wack, it looks like it was dipped in üí©

creations-chat 2021-02-13 03:45:14 most of them have lives outside of moderating a cesspool of a discord server
creations-chat 2021-02-13 03:48:59 there would be no staff if all of them moderated these 2 channels 24/7, they all would have quit
creations-chat 2021-02-13 03:51:52 theres 2 staff online, both on do not disturb
plus its just a god damn joke post
creations-chat 2021-02-13 03:53:54 you guys live in a fantasy if you expect 2 staff members to be online every damn hour of the day

creations-chat 2021-02-13 04:50:45 honestly the entire voting system in <#384025409945337856> pretty much killed any chance for a half decent community
creations-chat 2021-02-13 04:53:05 honestly if staff just kinda judged hof creates with a vote from themselves rather than the community and got rid of these stupid roles the community wouldnt be utter shit

bug-reports 2021-02-19 01:49:50 your camera needs to be underwater for it to aim that low
bug-reports 2021-02-19 01:50:08 if it isnt its going to aim at where your curser meets the water
bug-reports 2021-02-19 01:51:20 yes they can

bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:05:17 ur really making my head hurt
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:05:24 its because the guns are pointed at the waters surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:05:29 aim it at the floor of the ocean
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:05:40 the bullets will go through the surface and to the floor
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:05:56 bro this community has some high iq

bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:06:37 no im in a public
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:07:37 is it this hard just to grasp the fact that water is a transparent surface and when you aim through it to another target the bullets wont break at the top
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:07:55 this is some rocket science isnt it
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:11:00 you guys are on some serious shit
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:14:52 try aiming underneath
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:14:53 the water
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:14:54 maybe
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:15:24 works fine
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:18:46 
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:18:49 seems high enough
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:19:03 works fine
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:20:03 that angle is literally like 50 studs
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:20:15 more than that
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:20:39 do u not understand
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:20:47 if the camera isnt beneath the waters surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:20:49 the guns dont work
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:21:11 works absolutely fine for me
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:21:28 even at 9 blocks up at like a 20 degree angle
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:21:36 works absolutely fine
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:23:47 ok i just ran the calculator
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:23:54 thats angle roughly is 25 blocks before reaching the waters surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 02:24:10 the one i was shooting at
creations-chat 2021-02-19 02:36:25 would be 20x if it could move

bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:06:39 loooook
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:06:42 it works
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:07:28 its
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:07:28 no
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:07:33 not that complicated
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:08:09 water is a transparent surface so if your camera is outside of it aiming at it itll act as if it was a hard surface, if your camera is beneath it itll do the same except the bullets will go under
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:08:46 because the linear points between the guns and his curser gave an incorrect angle that wasnt aiming at the car but instead where his curser was on the surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:08:49 this isnt rocket science
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:08:54 ive explained it twice now
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:09:06 its 2 damn sentences
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:09:35 sorry your reading level hasnt changed since the 3rd grade
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:10:00 yes thats why im explaining it
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:10:10 almost as if i have experience with it
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:10:46 yes if your camera is beneath the water itll aim at whatever is pointing at
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:11:06 thats why you see guns glitch out a lot when firing underwater
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:11:17 once the object youre firing at is destroyed the guns pan back to aiming at the waters surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:11:49 but in this case since pc's glass makes water invisible but its still there the guns still worked as normal
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:11:59 he just changed what was going on visually not functionally
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:12:38 its the same thing with firing from underwater to the surface
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:13:08 most people are confused about this because they dont know why it not the same thing with above water
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:13:22 its simply because boats sit on the surface of the water
bug-reports 2021-02-19 05:15:50 youll see this same concept with shooting at helis when your camera is above them and youre firing from underneath the water

help 2021-02-20 01:50:36 how do u build tank suspension backwards
help 2021-02-20 01:50:59 the wheels move on one axis
help 2021-02-20 01:52:54 just
help 2021-02-20 01:53:02 put a piston on some suspension
help 2021-02-20 01:53:15 connect it to a motor
help 2021-02-20 01:53:28 and you have tank suspension
help 2021-02-20 01:54:15 like uhhhhhhhhh
help 2021-02-20 01:54:40 
help 2021-02-20 01:54:41 that
help 2021-02-20 01:55:24 it gives the wheel 2 blocks of room to move up and down
help 2021-02-20 01:55:31 allowing for more traction
help 2021-02-20 01:55:45 it acts like glue to the suspension
help 2021-02-20 01:55:58 the piston head and the top of the suspension move around freely
help 2021-02-20 01:56:11 while the piston body and lower end of the suspension act as walls of it
help 2021-02-20 01:56:26 i use it on a lot of my builds
help 2021-02-20 01:56:44 just set the piston to unpowered and set the max distance to 4 im pretty sure
help 2021-02-20 01:58:11 just move that contraption up a few blocks
help 2021-02-20 01:58:24 plus im pretty sure the front and back wheels dont have suspension iirc
help 2021-02-20 01:59:07 i mean
help 2021-02-20 01:59:13 if you want that Y looking thing
help 2021-02-20 01:59:16 its gonna take more room
help 2021-02-20 02:00:24 actually
help 2021-02-20 02:03:22 yea
help 2021-02-20 02:05:31 yes
help 2021-02-20 02:05:38 ill have to check what my suspension is
help 2021-02-20 02:05:43 suspension is really sensitive
help 2021-02-20 02:06:04 it depends a lot on the weight of the build
help 2021-02-20 02:07:43 this is a far simpler type of tread
help 2021-02-20 02:07:52 much more compact
help 2021-02-20 02:13:45 so my suspension
help 2021-02-20 02:13:50 is 50 dampening
help 2021-02-20 02:13:53 100 stiffness
help 2021-02-20 02:13:58 and 1.5 free length
help 2021-02-20 02:15:27 also if you want to you can use this
help 2021-02-20 02:16:05 the back wall is .9 blocks
help 2021-02-20 02:16:24 the middle motor is unpowered and the outer 2 are normal steering w forward a/d backward
help 2021-02-20 02:17:49 its unpowered
help 2021-02-20 02:18:25 
help 2021-02-20 02:19:04 the maxforce pretty much just unlocks the piston
help 2021-02-20 02:19:10 yea
help 2021-02-20 02:21:54 also creator
help 2021-02-20 02:22:03 if ur gonna be using wheels smaller than the 5x5
help 2021-02-20 02:22:09 id suggest using that Y suspension

plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:22:04 how do i not get 4 fps on my 5k part sub
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:27:39 5k parts underwater
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:27:48 a shit ton of moving parts too
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:28:25 and its not even my end either, its literally the shitty code
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:28:45 like i can run gta and csgo at the same time and still get 60 fps in gta
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:30:44 roblox runs fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:30:55 its just the fact that rickje hasnt optimized the games preformance at all
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:31:22 like you know how minecraft and terraria have billions of blocks all spawned in at once
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:31:38 but plane crazy struggles to hit the 10k mark
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:31:48 the best solution is to clump parts together
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:31:51 like how robocraft does
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:32:12 so instead of it being 5k individual parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:32:21 its 1 big part made of thousands of smaller ones
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:32:52 yep
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:33:42 take robocraft
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:33:48 literally the better version of pc
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:33:55 except for the custom guns
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:34:02 you can build fucking megabots
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:34:10 up to 10k parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:34:15 and easily get 50fps
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:34:21 in a match of 8+ people
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 00:34:55 not to mention water is a fucking ass whooping for fps too

help 2021-02-25 23:45:35 another way to fix this is to add a second main propellor to counteract the torque the first one is causing
help 2021-02-25 23:50:18 just add a second one on top going the opposide direction of the first propellor
help 2021-02-25 23:52:56 people trying to build stuff 1:1 usually always ends up either being looks only or it just is bad
help 2021-02-25 23:53:53 yea but the people who do make it possible end up scaling the build up to 2-3 times its original size
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:54:53 theyre so ass tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 23:56:13 okay put it on the ground

help 2021-02-26 02:25:20 yes because you can make different calibers in plane crazy
