creations-chat 2022-06-03 04:25:25 Can anyone help me to stop my build from twitching when using motorlocks?
general 2022-07-29 17:28:54 I love how summer is a week from being over
general 2022-07-29 17:39:19 summer as in summer break
general 2022-07-29 17:39:28 perhaps
general 2022-07-29 17:39:48 ew
general 2022-07-29 17:39:48 like a week for me
general 2022-07-29 17:40:02 i didnt know summer break could be "unique" in different places
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:44:03 Pc2 won't come out till like 2027 lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:44:33 As it appears we've been lied to, twice
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:47:35 Your not being ResPecTfUl tO yoUr pIeRs
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:48:19 M
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:48:22 I see
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:48:28 Cool I guess
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:50:12 Though I've never thought of making shredders or lag machines, I will sa I've been a disturbance to the in game community by continously playing small potatoes theme song while harassing people with a ragdoll sus looking worm
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:50:39 So I can relate to your statement just there
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:51:09 Which means kn a way your 1/3 percent correct
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:51:21 Atleast in my standards
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:53:12 This here is also a joke, which I didn't understand summer exactly ended on the 22nd, and was meant to be taken as a laughing standard
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:53:45 Though it appears I have a abnormal sensibility of what I'd consider "a joke"
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:55:30 And to rebutt your statement, I highly doubt pc2 will be released within the week of the 22nd od September, considering we haven't heard much from development relevant to this time frame.
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:55:58 Unless they're secretly planing a surprise release date
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:56:31 But there is an announcement saying there will be alpha testing, which means a surprise is VERY un likely.
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:58:23 <@845147285121007626> I hope you take my paragraphs into consideration, (though nobody asked me to say these things) so we could no longer have a conflict with me proving my points with paragraphs while you use two sentences c:
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 02:58:32 Have a good day/night
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:02:02 People who don't have the urge to read, dosnt mean they don't ready anything.
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:02:55 Along with eyesight and the human mind one would only be able to know if a paragraph had a lot of words, If they atleast read two words in there.
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:03:08 This is impossible to avoid infact, unless your...
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:03:43 "Inhumane" logically speaking
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:05:13 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:05:34 A new assumed homo sapien has entered the channel
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:05:55 As it appears, another assumingly human has joined the channel
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:06:40 Like I said, the only way to know whether it's a lot or not, is if you're for one, not blind, and two, human.
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:07:16 It was only about 24 words along with 23 spaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:07:44 It wouldn't be considered "a lot" unless your just Learning how to read
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:08:34 And with your responses, you seem to be able to read and type just enough for me to compensate your exactly you're saying
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:09:13 You probably do t have the right mindset to understand what im currently saying, though. Also based off of your respo ses
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:10:11 And there is a higher chance your just annoyed of me trying too hard to make it seem like i have atleast a 80 in science
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:10:39 So you have inappropriate age group responses
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:12:48 I hope I jUsT cReaTed a LiFe ChangInG eVent fOr u
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:13:07 For the both of u*
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 03:13:29 Have a good day/night (fr this time)
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 15:23:36 Does anyone know how to stabilize a small ship when hyper driving? I've already tried internal wing panels but it dosnt appear to work
