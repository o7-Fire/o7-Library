plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:09:37 I have suggestion, but i don't have permission to do soooo
why plane crazy separate its lot from main island
And make like private **Islands** for player to build at Several hundred distance from main island
So you get big lots and relatively easy to make
Make an island and spam it around
Easy job

general 2023-04-10 10:08:32 and then lost
general 2023-04-10 10:08:49 yeah my mistake is turning off workshop then
general 2023-05-04 17:08:04 whomst hath summoned
general 2023-05-04 17:09:01 same.
general 2023-05-04 17:09:31 i mean could be Nagato, since theres no amidship turrets as found on fuso
general 2023-05-04 17:09:36 but that definitely is *not* bismarck
general 2023-05-04 17:09:58 ey that sounds like my little project
general 2023-05-04 17:11:34 6. same armament as Ise class, superfirin fore, aft, and two amidship facing in an awkward direction separated by funnel, as opposed to Ise class superfiring aft
general 2023-05-04 17:12:38 I mean the ship originally doesnt had pagoda mast. pagoda mast trend only started late in the war. so back then those ship had smaller draught i guess, before remodernisations /shrug
general 2023-05-04 17:12:56 man why do i always missed out the naval hat
general 2023-05-04 17:12:57 chat
general 2023-05-04 17:15:16 uh excuse me? the ship in the picture above is the sevastopol, which was the russian gangut class battleship.
general 2023-05-04 17:15:55 Well it was still a dreadnought battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:16:03 but russian barely have any meaningful navy at ww2 anyway
general 2023-05-04 17:16:14 so they just remodernized their three only active gangut battleships
general 2023-05-04 17:17:36 Yep, and also older design trend, where superfiring was still considered new. some believed superfiring turrets means you'd group the turret together which means if a shell hits in the vicinity it could damage both turrets or more
general 2023-05-04 17:18:12 Nope
general 2023-05-04 17:18:30 at the speed of 40-43 kph, it is barely fast enough to keep up with faster ships
general 2023-05-04 17:18:53 the russian tried to make battlecruiser, the Borodino class, Kronstadt class, and Stalingrad class. but none of these were completed.
general 2023-05-04 17:19:41 she had armor belt of about 289-305mm if my memory serves me right, and with a dozen of 12 inch guns
general 2023-05-04 17:19:59 i mean kind of i guess
general 2023-05-04 17:20:06 since the russian barely take those ships out to the sea
general 2023-05-04 17:20:26 and the kommuna sits really low after modernisation, rendering her incompatible to the heavy ocean waves
general 2023-05-04 17:21:27 Well shes still waaay larger than coastal defence ship
general 2023-05-04 17:21:55 and remember these ships sits low in the water after the modernisation
general 2023-05-04 17:22:05 before the modernisation, they were a good 2-3 decks above the water
general 2023-05-04 17:22:11 and were actually capable of going to the ocran
general 2023-05-04 17:22:12 ocean
general 2023-05-04 17:22:49 not neccesarily
general 2023-05-04 17:23:26 theoretically speaking, making your ship deeper in the water means your critical component such as engine and ammunition is even deeper and the thickness of the main armor is added with idk how much waters
general 2023-05-04 17:23:39 i guess so
general 2023-05-04 17:23:54 but hey when they're modernised their deck armor was further reinforced
general 2023-05-04 17:24:12 their turret roof thickness was increased from 76.2mm to about 152mm if my memory serves me right
general 2023-05-04 17:24:39 i forgot about the overall deck armor, but i think kommuna added one or two more layer of armor sheet
general 2023-05-04 17:24:53 the modernisation added a new deck to the bow and stern
general 2023-05-04 17:25:02 i guess they fit in some metal sheets there
general 2023-05-04 17:25:14 i mean its the russian navy anyway
general 2023-05-04 17:25:21 rusts in the dock
general 2023-05-04 17:25:33 the arkhalerhdwjd something i forgot the name
general 2023-05-04 17:25:36 british lent battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:25:42 wasnt used by the soviet for like 10 years
general 2023-05-04 17:25:48 when the ship was returned to the british navy
general 2023-05-04 17:25:58 the entire thing had rot that even the turret was jammed in place since its never been used at all
general 2023-05-04 17:26:36 russians mostly divided their resources to the army anyway
general 2023-05-04 17:26:57 and their plans for capital ships were . . . pretty large, too large for the industry to handle in the end
general 2023-05-04 17:27:31 their armor factory cant make plates higher than 203mm and then sovetsky soyuz is like
general 2023-05-04 17:27:34 350mm+ armor belt
general 2023-05-04 17:27:40 the factory : wtf
general 2023-05-04 17:27:59 *creates extraordinarily brittle metal sheets*
general 2023-05-04 17:28:20 so even if the sovetsky soyuz did, somehow, materialize, despite how shit her beam to weight ratio and her awkward machinery arrangement, it will be lacking in alot of places
general 2023-05-04 17:28:55 I happen to read naval engineering alot 💀

general 2023-05-04 17:29:57 oh dat
general 2023-05-04 17:30:33 well the russian still uses tripple

general 2023-05-04 17:31:03 or some older US 12 inchers
general 2023-05-04 17:31:12 the Wyoming class also had quite alot of turret lmao
general 2023-05-04 17:32:32 yep
general 2023-05-04 17:32:42 battlecruiser *kind of* evolves into fast battleship in the end
general 2023-05-04 17:32:52 but ye battlecruiser is obsolete near thr end
general 2023-05-04 17:33:06 since the technology had advanced enough to have battleship with high speeds
general 2023-05-04 17:33:31 fast battleship were fast capital ships that are still expected to fight on the front line leading the main charge
general 2023-05-04 17:33:51 original battlecruiser did not have this role in mind, they were just to hunt down slower older battleship or smaller ships
general 2023-05-04 17:34:04 you could say "outrun anything that outguns you and outguns anything that outruns you"
general 2023-05-04 17:34:29 now think of it
general 2023-05-04 17:34:36 is the HMS Hood a Battlecruiser or a Fast Battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:36:09 The HMS Hood, had a speed of 32kt, so shes as fast as a battlecruiser
Her armor while slightly thinner than her Queen Elizabeth class counterpart, at 12 inch, was angled inward so that at expected combat range her armor thickness is more or less the same to the Queen elizabeth class battleship armor
And the HMS Hood fought in the frontline alongside the main fleet

yet shes called a battlecruiser, not fast battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:36:29 some question that always bugs me lol
general 2023-05-04 17:36:51 you can say so
general 2023-05-04 17:36:57 but remember the old original battlecruisers
general 2023-05-04 17:37:02 Kongo class, or Colossus class, etc
general 2023-05-04 17:37:11 they had no armor, and was not expected to fight with the main fleet
general 2023-05-04 17:37:20 that, was the original classic term for battlecruiser
general 2023-05-04 17:37:47 which resulted quite badly
general 2023-05-04 17:37:49 but tbh
general 2023-05-04 17:37:52 that make sense
general 2023-05-04 17:38:06 alot of british BC exploded themselves on the battle of jutland
general 2023-05-04 17:38:16 and the Hood, a battlecruiser, also explodes to bismarck
general 2023-05-04 17:38:22 i think this all started making sense <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2023-05-04 17:38:56 While the Kongo class didnt end up as explodable as British BC but still funny how they sunk to cruisers
general 2023-05-04 17:40:58 they did a great job yeah
general 2023-05-04 17:41:09 because they're pretty advanced at the time
general 2023-05-04 17:41:26 8x 356 wasnt something the US could easily laugh off, and at 56kph speed they outruns any US Battleship at the time
general 2023-05-04 17:41:53 the Kongo class triggered the development of the Iowa class, although the Iowa class kind of Overdid it lmao
general 2023-05-04 17:42:29 maybe
general 2023-05-04 17:42:36 <@783146411843125248> what ya say

general 2023-06-20 12:17:59 43 what
general 2023-06-20 12:22:25 hmmm
general 2023-06-20 12:22:33 still looks a bit like a fat BC
general 2023-06-20 12:22:47 a bit
general 2023-06-20 12:22:49 just a tiny bit
general 2023-06-20 12:23:14 tbh
general 2023-06-20 12:23:18 imo its the shape
general 2023-06-20 12:23:24 not the L:B ratio
general 2023-06-20 12:23:36 Battleship shape isnt full curve
general 2023-06-20 12:24:02 Curved hull like that creates less resistance against the water
general 2023-06-20 12:24:15 but less tonnage and place to put guns i guess
general 2023-06-20 12:24:18 less stability too
general 2023-06-20 12:28:40 yes
general 2023-06-20 13:02:37 Now that is, a US Dreadnought
general 2023-06-20 13:03:07 Brit ships?
general 2023-06-20 13:03:08 hmmm
general 2023-06-20 13:03:10 be more round
general 2023-06-20 13:03:13 just a little bit
general 2023-06-20 13:03:18 and thinner too
general 2023-06-20 13:03:35 British battleships are rounder
general 2023-06-20 13:03:41 especially queen elizabeth class
general 2023-06-20 13:03:51 oh my 💀
general 2023-06-20 13:03:58 POV Arkansas hull twisted after the nuclear test :
general 2023-06-20 13:04:48 brit superstructure
general 2023-06-20 13:04:51 flat.
general 2023-06-20 13:05:28 Missouri :
general 2023-06-20 13:05:47 anyway reactivating and remodernising Iowa class will be a massive waste of resource
general 2023-06-20 13:05:52 althought it is appealing
general 2023-06-20 13:05:59 uh
**yes.**
