plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:40:28 should i use front or backwards swept wing for a high velocity supermanueverable jet fighter
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:40:57 oh thx
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:41:06 pvp
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:41:15 anti shredder
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:44:15 from my testing
front swept make it less maneuverable but more stable
backward swept make it more maneuverable and less stable
X-wing make it very stable till it hard to maneuver
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:45:16 rocket?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:46:27 yes if you could waste time figure out how to make it usable
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:46:36 and not stuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:48:41 it's your option
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:48:57 most likely depend on what you like
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:50:40 60 angle will cause a lot of speed loss
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 13:51:07 20 angle will take up a lot of space to turn
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:00:38 just vote-kick is enough
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:01:44 for earrape people we can just mute but shredder family indeed
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:02:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:05:17 up to how stable your cfa 44
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:05:40 i would recommend 30-50
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:07:57 arent it the same thing?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:09:09 he's prob mean some group of friend kick people and make they're server's owner
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:11:11 make some code to work is hard, making ai is harder
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:13:58 man... lua is cooking master about making spaghetti
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:15:41 poor pc taking 2 minute leaving the game
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:17:24 you mean unlocking AMD's cpu core to make ryzen 3 to ryzen 5?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:17:54 overclock?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:18:13 i recommend back up your file
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:20:27 not produce framerate drop just delay stuff
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:21:34 it's not crashing just disconnect due to roblox server
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 14:23:36 fun fact : if you mining eth you could cook your food while mining it
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:23:28 Eurofighter version of f22
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:23:48 With a little spice of su 33
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:25:43 Can I see? I want to improve my thrust vectoring mine was taking 3x3xL space and hard to compactable
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:27:20 A little disappointment but you did nothing wrong
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:29:02 I use 4 motor 2 ,4 control surface(not use),4 text 1x2, and 4-16 wing panel
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:29:43 It's under development
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:30:21 I'm figuring how I'm I going to make it more compatable
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:31:14 It's not that complicated
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:33:06 Just imagine motor 2 base connect on plane then control surface on the back to make it not connect then use text 1x2 to connect servo with control surface then put wing panel as long as you want
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:34:16 Welp, I use drag for my supermaneuver
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:35:19 <@619312093962829849> If you don't know I use metal as metarial for my plane
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:36:18 It can trick rocket pathfinding in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:37:46 I don't know how
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:38:00 Anyway I need to study tmr
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:39:39 My plane more like realisticness so supermanuever I mean just imagine cobra or kulbit
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:41:14 I hate vtol
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:41:32 They make me have headache
