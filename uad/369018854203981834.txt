plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:55:09 How do magnets work?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:55:30 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:55:35 I tried it and nothing happened
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:55:39 they were near each other
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:56:18 also do the magnets in plane crazy emit a magnetic field which attracts other magnets with electric fields of the different charge?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:56:20 I dont think so
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:58:23 ik what magnets do
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:58:26 I want to know how they do
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:58:33 well how you make them do what they should do
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:58:50 but it's confusing
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:58:54 I dont understand half the terms
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:59:28 i'm 14 almost 15
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:59:54 Are you asking cuz you think that I'm a kid since I don't know how magnets work?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:59:56 :c
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:00:14 like I know what the words mean I just dont get how they apply
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:00:23 like I dont know what 'magnets only' would do
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:00:28 like it only attracts magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:00:49 no on magnet only mode I mean
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:01:12 what would toggle even do? what does it toggle? its not specific at all
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:01:25 What would it toggle?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:01:36 ???
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:01:43 wait so you can just turn magnets off?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:01:51 whats the point of even having them in the first place then?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:00 if you're just gonna toggle em off
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:06 what does weld do?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:11 does it weld the parts to the magnet?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:17 what does lose parts only mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:22 does it mean the magnet can only lose parts?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:37 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:37 Idk how to refuel
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:44 I started this game like 5 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:45 don't judge
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:02:52 what's antilag
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:03:19 I'm used to bym where magnets would only attract to other magnets
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:03:28 but I still don't get what 'lose parts only' does
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:03:49 well its still confusing
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:03:51 >;c
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:04:08 I still don't know what antilag is
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:04:47 What is antilag?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:04:58 makes it not lag?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:05:03 but why would you need it to lag in the first place?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:05:30 like I dont think games should allow people to just lag the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:05:54 <@!486674992981999648> https://gyazo.com/5817177ac6e1d05322fd7494648e5879
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:06:27 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:06:31 but why would you need the game to lag?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:06:38 ???
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:06:46 yea and
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:07:10 then why not just force antilag on?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:07:39 ???
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:07:40 Wdym
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:11:36 I have another question from magnets
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:11:54 Why would there need to be an option to go forwards and backwards?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:11:59 with magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:12:01 and how does it work?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:12:16 yea ik
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:12:33 but wouldnt it be really hard to control?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:12:46 ok ok sorry jeez ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:09 my magnets aren't working
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:19 ohhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:21 that's a thing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:27 welp
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:34 Sorry I didn't see it
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:13:38 jeez its not like its common sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:00 How would I know unless I found it myself or someone told me
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:15 Do I really have to read everything on my screen?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:25 >;c
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:25 I don't automatically read everything that pops up you know
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:39 wow weirdo
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:43 ok bye im going to help
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:14:44 >;c
help 2019-04-02 05:14:57 How do magnets work?
help 2019-04-02 05:15:02 They're extremely confusing to me
help 2019-04-02 05:15:13 Wow helpful
help 2019-04-02 05:15:14 üòÑ
help 2019-04-02 05:16:39 oh I thought you were trying to be offensive to me
help 2019-04-02 05:16:44 what's a fuselage
help 2019-04-02 05:17:18 I was confused by magnets cuz I thought their range was a circle around em instead of just infront
help 2019-04-02 05:17:27 This game isn't proving to be very realistic.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:18:16 Yea
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:18:18 it was
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:18:32 sorry I was asking dumb questions before cuz I thought this game would be more realistic and make sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:18:46 like I thought magnets only attracted other magnets since thats how magnets work
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:18:57 same with the range thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:19:32 No I know they can but
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:19:39 before i thought they only could attract other magnets
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:20:03 since magnets dont just pick up random items that don't have a charge to them
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:20:11 ekk
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:22:37 mkay
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:22:57 are there hinges in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:23:13 dumb but ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:23:51 is there a way to make stuff non collide surface?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:23:59 so they don't weld together?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:29:31 argh my internet crashed when I was building

help 2019-09-23 05:01:14 so which blocks allow me to not weld
help 2019-09-23 05:02:12 is there any other way to activate a block other than keybind?
help 2019-09-23 05:02:26 like turn on a piston etc
help 2019-09-23 05:02:42 Hmm that's boring
help 2019-09-23 05:02:45 oh well ü§∑
