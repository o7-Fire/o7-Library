general 2023-03-28 06:36:49 i was gonna say
general 2023-03-28 06:36:54 that is just every server
general 2023-03-28 06:37:56 every server that is centered around a videogame
general 2023-03-28 06:38:14 g*mer moment
general 2023-03-28 06:39:22 i only know one
general 2023-03-28 06:39:54 it's a racial slur what are you talking about
general 2023-03-28 06:42:33 how do i get image perms in this place
general 2023-03-28 06:42:40 i want to post my mid planes
general 2023-03-28 06:42:52 and ask for advice
general 2023-03-28 06:42:54 i see
general 2023-03-28 06:43:06 okay yeet
general 2023-03-28 06:43:11 what do you want to talk about
general 2023-03-28 06:43:25 obviously
general 2023-03-28 06:43:31 we need to have a real conversation

bot-central 2023-03-28 06:44:42 crazy
general 2023-03-28 06:46:03 uhh
general 2023-03-28 06:46:11 a really bad p-40
general 2023-03-28 06:46:28 my friend's spitfire build which i am half sure he modified from a tutorial
general 2023-03-28 06:46:53 right now i am experimenting with controls on my me262
general 2023-03-28 06:47:03 and i also have no idea if i have it at the correct scale
general 2023-03-28 06:48:07 oh i am also trying to make a really huge wall
general 2023-03-28 06:48:21 because 2 of my friends have colossal titans
general 2023-03-28 06:48:25 (without arms)
general 2023-03-28 06:49:50 that's just a fancy shredder bug
general 2023-03-28 06:52:55 right now im just trying to figure out how to fit landing gear into the 1 block wide nose of my plane
general 2023-03-28 06:54:20 im losing sleep over this game
general 2023-03-28 06:54:37 it's too easy to lose track of time when building and testing a plane
general 2023-03-28 06:55:06 zamn
general 2023-03-28 06:56:31 why do we have small and tiny landing gear but no medium and large landing gear
general 2023-03-28 06:56:54 i only have like four days
general 2023-03-28 06:56:59 of playtime
general 2023-03-28 06:59:34 how fast is levelling anyway

general 2023-03-28 07:00:16 maybe it takes a while
general 2023-03-28 07:00:42 all i want is to get someone else's opinion on whether my plane is the right scale or not
general 2023-03-28 07:01:09 cool
general 2023-03-28 07:02:00 crazy
general 2023-03-28 07:02:17 charging up the racism
general 2023-03-28 07:03:04 bugged spawns in pvp mode server
general 2023-03-28 07:08:12 have people made mouse guided rockets yet
general 2023-03-28 07:08:27 that is crazy
general 2023-03-28 07:10:57 more like trying to tack on a new feature only to realize it wont work 2 hours later
general 2023-03-28 07:11:12 that is what emojis are for

general 2023-03-28 07:13:41 what block do people use to make the metal supports of the glass on cockpits
general 2023-03-28 07:14:42 plane crazy gameplay
general 2023-03-28 07:14:49 start new plane
general 2023-03-28 07:14:55 realize you are off scale so start again
general 2023-03-28 07:15:09 realize that the curvature is off or something so you have to redo a large portion
general 2023-03-28 07:15:19 motorlocking shenanigans
general 2023-03-28 07:15:45 one of your motorlocks break after you add something but you dont know what broke it
general 2023-03-28 07:15:54 now the wings are acting up
general 2023-03-28 07:16:07 you fix the wings but now the plane is wobbly
general 2023-03-28 07:16:15 30 minutes spent balancing the plane
general 2023-03-28 07:16:21 now the plane turns too slowly
general 2023-03-28 07:16:27 edit controls and motors again
general 2023-03-28 07:16:32 now it's wobbly

general 2023-03-28 07:23:20 can one of you go to creations and tell me if my me262 is too big
general 2023-03-28 07:24:59 it's joever
general 2023-03-28 07:26:42 dio pose
general 2023-03-28 07:27:39 why do you want to know
plane-crazy 2023-03-28 07:33:12 too big or is it fine?
general 2023-04-03 21:34:19 god i love it when my build starts functioning completely differently without me changing anything!
general 2023-04-03 21:34:27 i love it so much!!
general 2023-04-03 21:36:02 i want to eat a shotgun barrel
general 2023-04-03 21:36:16 i had a perfectly good and fun orbital strike system
general 2023-04-03 21:36:32 and now all of a sudden my steering on my missiles is getting stuck
general 2023-04-03 21:36:36 WITHOUT ME CHANGING ANYTHING
general 2023-04-03 21:36:48 I JUST SPAWNED IN AND NOW I DOESN'T WORK
general 2023-04-03 21:38:26 was it really a game update
general 2023-04-03 21:38:29 that broke everything
general 2023-04-03 21:38:31 will it be fixed
general 2023-04-03 21:38:34 please please please
general 2023-04-03 21:38:39 please tlel me
general 2023-04-03 21:38:42 that this will be fixed
general 2023-04-03 21:38:53 roblox update then
general 2023-04-03 21:39:12 ok so it's not just me
general 2023-04-03 21:39:14 thank god
general 2023-04-03 21:40:23 does it at the very least get fixed fast
general 2023-04-03 21:42:07 so are literally all motor 2s on servo mode
general 2023-04-03 21:42:09 broken
general 2023-04-03 21:42:21 i mean
general 2023-04-03 21:42:24 no not servo
general 2023-04-03 21:42:28 just in general
general 2023-04-03 21:42:35 they're just all broken now
general 2023-04-03 21:42:49 is that what you're saying
general 2023-04-03 21:43:24 WOW
general 2023-04-03 21:43:29 so specifically the type
general 2023-04-03 21:43:34 that i was just spending time on
general 2023-04-03 21:43:39 to use in my orbital strike system
general 2023-04-03 21:43:55 the exact type that i was using just so happens to break while im having fun with it
general 2023-04-03 21:44:03 are you kidding me???
general 2023-04-03 21:44:27 do i have to switch to control panels now??
general 2023-04-03 21:45:12 what is m2m
general 2023-04-03 21:45:53 what does m2m stand for
general 2023-04-03 21:46:04 oh
general 2023-04-03 21:46:16 and what's glitched mouse
general 2023-04-03 21:46:45 me and my 6 days of total playtiem
general 2023-04-03 21:46:46 time
general 2023-04-03 21:48:27 why do they work fine when anchored or moving slowly but when i go any faster than like
general 2023-04-03 21:48:29 walking speed
general 2023-04-03 21:48:34 they start bugging out
general 2023-04-03 21:51:24 am i supposed to just wait now
general 2023-04-03 21:51:29 and hope motor 2s get fixed
general 2023-04-03 21:51:37 within a month
general 2023-04-03 21:53:48 actually for now i think my mouth will be having very close relations with the barrel of a gun
general 2023-04-03 22:02:53 this is literally the only game i play on roblox now
general 2023-04-03 22:03:32 what am i supposed to do
general 2023-04-03 22:05:08 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-04-03 22:05:30 maybe i should use my really old p-40 that doesnt use any motor 2s
general 2023-04-03 22:05:38 and instead just has motor 1s on reset
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:06:50 motor 2s with wings specifically
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:06:54 so like
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:06:59 switch to control panels
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:07:13 because screw everyone i guess
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:07:50 either that or build a helicopter
general 2023-04-03 22:09:41 so has the roblox update affected any other games or just pc
general 2023-04-03 22:10:28 motor 2s are
general 2023-04-03 22:10:33 yes they are totally just fine
general 2023-04-03 22:11:13 are they connected to wings
general 2023-04-03 22:11:19 and moving
general 2023-04-03 22:11:26 but no wings
general 2023-04-03 22:11:41 try making a simple fast plane that uses motor 2s for steering
general 2023-04-03 22:11:48 maybe this just means
general 2023-04-03 22:11:52 that motor 2s are fixed now
general 2023-04-03 22:12:43 maybe it's over
general 2023-04-03 22:13:39 still broken for me
general 2023-04-03 22:13:44 yipee
general 2023-04-03 22:14:46 good idea
general 2023-04-03 22:14:52 i'll make a working oven
general 2023-04-03 22:15:03 that can cook stuff
general 2023-04-03 22:15:10 wait no i already have a microwave
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:23:45 this is my first time experience a pc game function being broken
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:23:48 so exciting
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:24:22 yipee
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:24:54 it's like a solar eclipse but you get a bonus catastrophic failure in your steering
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:25:26 actually if it's that common then more like a full moon
general 2023-04-03 22:26:54 im gonna build a huge flying motor
general 2023-04-03 22:27:49 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-04-03 22:27:58 it's not funny anymore
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:28:56 it's motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:29:00 that are broken
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:29:04 motor 2s with wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:29:17 i see
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:32:11 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486250928761208863/989907140368015480/unknown.gif
general 2023-04-03 22:33:02 safer than most selfie with a gun videos
general 2023-04-03 22:33:17 unless he like drops it on his foot
general 2023-04-03 22:35:59 the arabian remix is nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 09:45:48 are motor 2s still broken
help 2023-04-04 09:54:29 they have been broken for 12 hours now
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:30:04 they're not fixed yet?
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:30:44 it's only motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:30:59 try switching to control panels or motor 1 with brick built stoppers
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:31:34 me personally i will try building ground vehicles today
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:43:40 is it more than just plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 14:43:52 i thought everyone was experiencing it
general 2023-04-04 16:37:10 they're still broken?
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:42:04 ~2000 casual plane crazy players who are not informed of the motor 2 bug are going insane trying to find out why their planes are suddenly not working
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:42:21 (they will irreversibly break several of their builds trying to find the problem)
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:44:34 me when I lie
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:45:23 MY MOTORS ARE WORKING
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:45:25 IN MY PRIVATE SERVER
general 2023-04-04 16:45:45 my motors are working
general 2023-04-04 16:46:13 finally
general 2023-04-04 16:46:17 i can play the game again
general 2023-04-08 16:28:22 there are two people arguing in roblox chat right now over thin air
general 2023-04-08 16:28:45 one guy is repeatedly calling the other guy an ipad kid and now they're trading discord ids
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:55:21 simply dont build jets and return to propeller driven planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 13:30:05 does anyone know a way to put thrust vectoring into a plane that isnt just propeller spam or the nam one
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 13:30:21 i want to do post stall maneuvers in a plane that cannot do post stall maneuvers
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 13:30:33 but i cant fit anything inside cause it's like
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 13:30:36 2 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 13:31:37 😔
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:39:54 when you have your tnt set to impact explosion
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:01 there is a set speed at which it will be triggered
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:19 so basically impact speed changes how sensitive your impact bomb is
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:34 if it’s low it’ll explode at a light bump
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:40 and then what jeff said
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:45 now my turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:40:49 does text have weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:41:02 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:41:47 what do you mean by the speed it explodes
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:41:58 like how fast the blast radius expands?
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:42:03 i think that’s always constant
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:43:02 I’m not the end all be all of plane crazy info
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:43:07 maybe get a second opinion
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:44:07 have people shared working huds on this server
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 17:44:30 i really wanna try and make one that’s for 3rd person view
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:01:51 i already saw it
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:01:55 i searched
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:02:08 I’m talking about 3rd person
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:02:38 you would have to align it with your screen but it would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:11:01 have people made conjoined builds before
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:11:15 like you build two halves of something and then roll them together
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:11:21 then lock them in place somehow
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:13:23 yeah that’s what i was thinking
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:13:32 have people made stuff like that i wanna see
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:13:54 it would allow for parts of a build to be controlled by different people
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:15:21 i mean
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:15:41 ive flown with an entire b17 wing noclipped into my plane before
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:15:54 i didnt lag but it was so huge that the lift cancelled out my controls
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:15:57 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:16:14 i was stuck sideways cause it was stuck vertically
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:16:27 couldnt turn and stuff but it was funny
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:16:47 i cant even go under 100 ping
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:16:54 what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:17:17 the screenshot is on my laptop though so i cant show rn
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:17:53 the guy was also still flying with only one wing so i had to ask him to blow up the tnt in his wings so i could move again
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:11 it feels too rigid when i do that
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:27 i like it when the camera drifts a little when i fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:27:56 ill try to come up with something
plane-crazy 2023-04-11 18:28:08 no idea how I’m gonna fit it into a 2 block wide plane but i will try
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:43:35 pcc members when you can’t reinvent the wheel whenever you make something
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:50:04 that’s what I’m saying man
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:52:46 feels like I’m gonna get flamed for using a half cylinder and a motor for a wheel because it’s not original enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:57:40 when the exaggeration is exaggerated
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:58:37 whatever cylinder man
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 15:58:53 different sizes depending on your vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 22:23:20 i got a headache trying to follow what they were doing
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:03:58 the nam nam rocket pod
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:04:13 block for block
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:04:45 does it work
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:05:49 it looks to be exactly the same as in nam's tutorial
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:07:21 the one in the rocket pod thing is supposed to fall off after the tnt explodes
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:07:38 and then the single stack motor tower will keep the rockets together after the main tower falls off
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:08:23 i tried building the thing myself and it worked but you really cant stray away
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:08:26 from the design
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:10:06 honestly man i watched the video like twice i dont have it memorized
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:10:13 i cant tell if the guy in the pic messed up or not
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:11:59 as long as it isn't a tutorial for an entire vehicle i have no problem with it
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:12:29 there's no need to reinvent the wheel every time you have to make something
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:12:56 true
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:13:31 the way I see it
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:13:37 as long as you don't exclusively follow tutorials
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:13:46 you're gonna be okay
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:14:29 i use the two words interchangeably
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:14:36 but yeah actually they're two different things
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:15:21 did you set the single motor tower to both lock and powered
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:16:59 nam loves using trails to connect things together
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:17:21 also they're supposed to be connecting the tnt to the motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:17:46 let me try to build it
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:17:54 maybe i can join your server idk
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:18:31 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:21:55 my laptop is not having a good time right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:37:37 <@676596610947612703> you forgot to link the 3 wide motorlocks together in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:38:32 
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:39:10 there should be another trail/cylinder/wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:39:45 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:39:46 
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:39:49 here
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:40:06 I'm gonna be real with you dude
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:40:09 this is like
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:40:13 basic motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:41:33 come back
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:41:44 or wait no
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:41:45 ill join you
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:42:14 ok come back then
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:42:17 !!
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 23:51:04 color coded because i was trying to figure out where the other guy went wrong
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:03:36 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:03:38 and they do
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:03:43 then the motorlock tower falls off
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:04:18 it falls off and they stay together
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:04:28 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:06:12 they're all on different keybinds
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:07:20 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:10:48 i built it and it functioned for 10 minutes and when i checked again it stopped working properly
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:11:02 https://tenor.com/view/angy-bladerunner-blade-runner-2049-gif-16913771
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:13:22 i think it's partially dependant on how laggy you are
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:15:04 anyway i was able to finally get n1nja's to work
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:19:27 ok it looks like
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:19:32 anchor blocks are just very annoying
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:20:23 it bricks up when i turn off physics and it's inconsistent if i turn on physics
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:20:32 so i just built a block tower to support the build
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:27:25 plane crazy gameplay
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:27:35 game breaking bug every 4 days
bot-central 2023-04-14 00:30:41 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:52:14 propeller spam or that thing with hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:52:33 or just put actual thrust vectoring on it if you want to
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:53:00 as is usally the case
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:53:04 minor spelling mistake
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:56:01 just talk for like 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:56:05 zamn
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:56:40 does it fly well
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 00:57:10 what's the top speed like
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:01:30 there's a thing you can try with hover thrusters if you have at least a 3 block wide space
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:01:56 won't fit or don't want to because it's nam
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:02:00 or both
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:02:22 then just
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:02:26 spam propellers
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:03:40 then i dont know man
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:18:48 maybe you could like
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:04 have a hover thruster facing up and another one facing down
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:11 and there is a text box connected to a motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:14 on top of them
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:23 motor 2 on servo
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:42 and then when you press a key the text box goes in front of the hover thruster you want to activate
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:19:51 which pushes your plane in the direction you want
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:20:01 it could fit in a 1x2x2 space
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:20:09 well
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:20:12 one of the hovers
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:23:33 funny 180 degree turn in .1 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:24:05 i don't even really have a full jet right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:24:09 aside from my me 262
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:24:15 cannot be bothered to build one
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:24:42 i use a spitfire for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:25:19 i can kinda cobra in it even though i have no stall movement
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:27:34 i put like several weapons on mine but i dont ever get the chance to use them since im too laggy
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:27:51 + the cluster bomb loves getting stuck in my landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:29:04 i have to spin around and open and close the landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:29:07 every single time
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:29:43 anyway i plane on shrinking the gears soon so hopefully that fixes my cluster bomb problem
general 2023-04-14 01:35:05 the skin stays on even if you sell it
general 2023-04-14 01:35:20 you might as well just put it on and then get free money after
general 2023-04-14 01:35:44 fair enough
general 2023-04-14 01:35:56 me personally i just put different combinations of the skin on each loadout
general 2023-04-14 01:36:00 before selling it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:36:12 plane crazy brainrot

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:40:21 does text have weight and drag
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:41:07 i wanna try making a third person view hud
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:43:09 this is why tnt with 0 blast radius is better
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:44:32 time to do some weight testing
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:49:54 i use a combination of m2m and keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:50:01 made it so i can toggle between them too
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:51:04 all you have to do is fly straight for like 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:52:53 man why are motor 2s so weak
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:11 should torque on them be high or low
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:30 i have like 8 rockets motorlocked together
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:41 connected to a motor2
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:48 more like 6
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:54:50 doesn't change the fact that my rocket pod has epilepsy
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:55:26 m2m
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:55:31 but i guess
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:55:33 realistically
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:55:43 it would be on a vehicle that would just turn towards the target
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:55:48 instead of the pod itself
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:56:43 are wireless engines any good
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:03:00 like
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:03:15 the engine is completely separate from the flying part of the build
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:03:22 through anchor block and conveyor magic
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:03:31 so you can have really tiny flying builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:04:46 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evPtgPaLsnM
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:05:00 this is 1 of the 2 videos on yt about wireless engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:05:32 you can make a disconnector plate fly using it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:08:06 idk
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:08:56 his toggle hover engine thing is also pretty good imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:09:21 i use it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 02:14:14 i don't like shitting on people
general 2023-04-14 02:25:14 are you matthew patrick

creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:01:57 i think in that specific message he is referring to the general dislike for whitenames rather than what’s happening to him right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 07:06:58 people aren’t made of money
general 2023-04-15 07:11:51 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 03:52:29 is there a way to stop motor2s from flinging around uncontrollably after going too fast or do i just kill myself
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 04:17:39 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/497142796961054721/1081443820861919313/attachment.gif
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 04:30:57 OKAY never mind I want to live myself now
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 04:31:06 i had to split the control surfaces into two parts
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 04:31:11 but it was worth it
general 2023-04-18 02:39:45 cameras are weightless and invisible but have hitboxes right
general 2023-04-18 02:41:32 picture this
general 2023-04-18 02:41:44 huge folding box in front of your plane to capture planes in front of you
general 2023-04-18 02:41:53 extremely impractical
general 2023-04-18 02:42:01 but it's weightless so it wouldn't change anything
general 2023-04-18 02:43:39 it would be folded along the length of your plane at rest but then you press and hold a button that makes it fold forwards into a cage
general 2023-04-18 02:43:59 using motor 1 with lock on so it doesnt flop
general 2023-04-18 02:44:50 that is another thing i was thinking off
general 2023-04-18 02:45:07 since you could literally just cover your plane in them and they would be invisible armor
general 2023-04-18 02:45:35 that is crazy
general 2023-04-18 02:46:43 are kids really joining discord at 9 years old
general 2023-04-18 02:46:59 member since 2021

general 2023-04-18 02:47:26 wow my birthday
general 2023-04-18 02:49:22 no way
general 2023-04-18 02:49:23 no shot

general 2023-04-18 02:50:23 so glad my little brother wont even so much as comment on youtube 🙏
general 2023-04-18 02:51:36 are flares worth putting into a plane
general 2023-04-18 02:52:10 what are the odds of a single trail block attracting pc rockets
general 2023-04-18 02:52:15 but anyway
general 2023-04-18 02:52:17 i still did it
general 2023-04-18 02:52:20 because it looks cool
general 2023-04-18 03:06:12 interstellar
general 2023-04-18 03:13:06 can your shuttle spin horizontally
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:17:20 what do you mean by doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:17:39 you need to click from the back
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:17:43 to configure it properly
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:17:52 changing the text without using config is a roblox bug
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:06 click it from the back or sides
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:13 not from the front where the text is
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:31 or better yet just configure the sign before you place it
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:43 keep in mind that the bug will still happen even when you launch
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:50 if you click on the sign
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:18:53 and start typing
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:21:02 dont try to type single characters
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:21:25 i think there's a system in place/just roblox chat filter that prevents you from placing a bunch of single letters/numbers
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 03:21:30 since it lets you bypass the filter
general 2023-04-18 03:25:13 why do you say that with uncertainty
general 2023-04-18 03:25:23 it WILL be 1964 next year
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 12:57:03 what are the most lag inducing blocks so i know what to replace in my builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 13:08:10 wait for it to rain
general 2023-04-18 13:09:54 it sounded more like a humorous response to me
general 2023-04-18 13:10:42 yeah it sounded like “WT better L bozo 🥱”
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 13:11:57 fuck
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 13:12:03 the motorlock towers

general 2023-04-18 13:12:41 the failure to read tone in a joke message has now causes a heated debate that could have otherwise been avoided <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-04-18 13:18:53 which one will run better on a potato
general 2023-04-18 13:20:29 in terms of dramatic effect
general 2023-04-18 13:20:34 which one is more pronounced
general 2023-04-18 13:22:08 which fanbase hates itself and the game it’s about more
general 2023-04-18 13:22:22 like league
general 2023-04-19 08:21:57 how big is 1 block in meters
general 2023-04-19 08:22:14 are you sure
general 2023-04-19 08:23:06 isn't it a cubic meter and not a meter when in minecraft
general 2023-04-19 08:23:24 i want the length of one block in plane crazy
general 2023-04-19 08:23:46 just in meters
general 2023-04-19 08:23:51 real life meters
general 2023-04-19 08:25:10 i stacked 13 blocks and it does not look like 13 meters to me
general 2023-04-19 08:25:26 and yeah
general 2023-04-19 08:25:33 roblox characters are not to scale with humans
general 2023-04-19 08:25:38 they're like
general 2023-04-19 08:25:40 squished like lego characters
general 2023-04-19 08:27:21 if i were to build a 13.44 meter long plane how many blocks long would you suggest i make it
general 2023-04-19 08:27:29 in your expert opinion
general 2023-04-19 08:27:56 1:1 scale
general 2023-04-19 08:29:24 i would send an image of the plane here but haha whitename
general 2023-04-19 08:29:43 que 15 gifs of image perm flex
general 2023-04-19 08:30:20 13 blocks looks way too small
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:31:08 <@200793484053970944> this is what im building
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:31:27 i really dont think 13 blocks is gonna cut it
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:33:45 look man,
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:34:03 all im saying is
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:34:07 this doesnt look like 13 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:34:30 13 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:35:07 what are they gonna do with it
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:35:48 it's not even a new jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:35:56 and only like 4 countries use it
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:35:58 it's tiny
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:36:49 why would they not have intel on this plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:37:00 how would that image add to their database at all
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 08:37:38 it's literally a page 1 image from google
general 2023-04-19 08:45:39 that is crazy
general 2023-04-19 08:45:41 what did you say
general 2023-04-19 08:45:58 what did you say
general 2023-04-19 08:46:19 give an example
general 2023-04-19 08:46:31 surely you didnt actually say something racist
general 2023-04-19 08:46:35 right?
general 2023-04-19 08:47:38 extreme embed fail
general 2023-04-19 08:47:46 wait for 30 seconds
general 2023-04-19 08:48:21 burnt human
general 2023-04-19 08:48:39 justified ban
general 2023-04-19 08:48:42 smh
general 2023-04-19 08:49:07 roblox players when they say something racist and get banned for racism
general 2023-04-19 08:50:18 pcc trying to avoid the racism allegations:
general 2023-04-19 08:51:37 no way are you comparing black people to burnt steak
general 2023-04-19 08:51:42 no way
general 2023-04-19 08:52:07 sooty are you seeing what im seeing right now
general 2023-04-19 08:52:15 are you for real
general 2023-04-20 01:34:28 does anyone have a good picture of a mirage v's weapon pylons
general 2023-04-20 01:36:46 google doesnt wanna give me pictures of the mirage v
general 2023-04-20 01:36:50 only the iii
general 2023-04-20 01:36:52 and the iv
general 2023-04-20 01:36:56 and the 2000
general 2023-04-20 01:37:04 and every other mirage except for the one im making right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:33:00 this thing really looks like a space shuttle
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:33:45 too lazy to build a thruster
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:36:15 whoooosh
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:36:40 french plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:37:01 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:37:06 peak whitename plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:37:29 i didnt know how else i would make it super sharp like the actual mirage v
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:37:56 well i do know
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:38:05 motorlocking, piston locking and camera locking
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:38:08 but like
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:38:09 hell no
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:39:32 well maybe i could angle lock another set of 1x4 triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:39:39 but I'll do that another day
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:39:44 i just wanna fly right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:40:26 the entire thing is motorlocked
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:40:54 it's a combination of 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:41:05 so i had to motorlock everything to align properly
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 03:41:40 lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:42:01 can you be less sure
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:42:08 different materials have different weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:42:19 making things out of wood makes them lighter
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:42:34 but on certain blocks they become heavier when you make them out of wood
general 2023-04-20 10:46:56 he is smirking
general 2023-04-20 10:50:00 why is there always some argument going on it at least one channel in this server
general 2023-04-20 10:50:21 the <#504436696021204992> in question:
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:51:27 i am talking about ingame materials.
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:51:58 that i am not sure about
general 2023-04-20 10:52:43 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-04-20 10:54:01 ok actually,
general 2023-04-20 10:54:05 how does he manage to dance that well
general 2023-04-20 10:54:08 while weighing so much
general 2023-04-20 10:55:00 true
general 2023-04-20 10:55:30 im talking about weird al yankovic not your message
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:57:36 it doesn't show up on the ball thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:57:41 but try with suspension
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:57:53 very sensitive suspension
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 10:58:08 i think there are youtube videos covering material weight
general 2023-04-20 11:01:35 how old is that screenshot
help 2023-04-20 11:03:35 i think you just have too many wing panels
help 2023-04-20 11:03:51 too much lift
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:47:30 is this enough for a mega downvote
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 12:49:56 <@841601743480815637> dorito
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:52:51 yipee
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:55:52 this is the part where you tell me how badly i went wrong
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 13:10:27 in the imaginary new map for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 13:10:42 coming to roblox servers near you in the year 2394
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:44:43 i want to try and fix it by angle locking more 1x4 triangle wedges into it but idk how im gonna evenly spin something that's 2x2

does the slowmode really need to be two whole minutes
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:47:22 i'll give it a shot tomorrow (i have to move so much stuff out of the way in the motorlock tower)
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:49:24 how would you suggest i make a very sharp and long nose for my mirage v
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:51:52 <@467459282250629120> can we move here the slowmode is unbearable
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:52:34 this is one of my referene images
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:52:40 reference
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:52:45 minor spelling mistake
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:54:02 
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:54:18 (pretend for a moment that the philippines has a mirage v in their possession)
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:54:43 im still not super sure about the angle of the wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:55:40 im gonna go and make a separate plot to test nose designs i guess
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:56:57 wow for once someone gives regular and helpful feedback in pcc
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:58:46 do tell
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:59:13 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:59:13 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 15:59:19 when you have time
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:06:14 half motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:06:18 instead of two locked motors facing each other, you just have one motor that moves a block by half
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:15:08 yeah this isnt gonna work
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:15:16 unless i put in like 50 of them
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:15:23 custom angles it is
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:15:30 ...tomorrow
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:16:05 it would make for a good drill
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:17:58 nosejob
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:19:19 jittering how
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:19:21 in what way
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:19:27 like pieces are becoming misaligned or just
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:19:31 the whole thing is jittering
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:19:58 are you playing in public servers
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:20:18 someone could just be using one of those spinning things that spin small blocks really fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:20:29 they can fling you a little bit while you fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:21:07 either that or you have a motor2 locked inside of something else
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:21:27 they extend with magic
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:21:33 and by magic i mean i dont really know how they work
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:22:29 just make sure the retracting wing and any of the moving parts are not motorlocked inside of anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:22:38 cause well
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:22:47 you can't really move something when it's inside of another object
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:47:33 <@467459282250629120> something like this?
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:49:54 ok well im gonna go to sleep
plane-crazy 2023-04-20 16:49:57 and continue this tomorrow
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:18:16 god i love it when a random block i place goes completely invisible and i have to rejoin to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:18:51 plane crazy minor inconvenience compilation
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:29:19 do unpowered trail blocks still cause a lot of frame lag
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:30:03 like toggle off and set to an off key
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:30:13 wow thank you discord for the message delay
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:33:40 hey blues
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:33:43 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:33:45 is the nose better now
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:34:47 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:34:50 let me step out wait
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:35:14 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:35:47 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:35:55 average plane crazy nose missing the corners
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:37:23 you just need to spend 30 minutes adding and removing wing panels in the front and back
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:37:37 until plane crazy's physics engine decided you're now stable
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:40:14 how do you even tell where the actual lift and center of mass are in a build that's full of motorlocks before launch
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:40:23 augh
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:40:49 why cant rickje just make it so you can view lift and center of mass after launching
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:41:03 by toggling something
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:41:34 no I know
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:41:39 but come on
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:41:43 such a simple thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:45:17 half pyramid wedge when
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:45:23 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:47:03 can't wait for pc2 where they add g-forces and now turning 180 degrees will give you brain damage
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:47:47 you will just have to slow down and turn slower
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:48:11 why do control surfaces get more sensitive the faster you go
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:48:18 what happened to control lockup
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:48:49 im talking in general
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:49:03 shouldn't it be harder to move control surfaces the faster you're going
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:54:08 my spitfire that was working just 5 days ago is now super wobbly
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:55:00 not motor2
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:55:01 just
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:55:06 somehow the weight changed
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:55:14 and now it wobbles up and down
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:57:26 does it just spin your plane around something in the center
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:57:29 when you press wasd
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:57:57 explain the plane crazy tech to us
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:58:11 it sounds like cheating but whatever
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:59:44 it looks really unnatural
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 03:59:51 like your plane just snaps into position
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:00:03 no thank you
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:01:57 the blood rushing to my feet after you describe that:
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:06:07 on a scale of 1-10 how whitename is this thruster
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:06:37 should i change it
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:08:08 i made mine like that because the rocket thruster has effects already
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:08:13 so might as well
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:08:23 also the sound of the jet engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:09:49 it feels weird to be flying a jet while not hearing a jet engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:10:49 i put small jet engines inside my jets just for the sound
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:13:55 do air brakes work in pc
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:14:57 i feel like putting airbrakes on my mirage using backwards control panels
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:15:30 see the problem there is
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:15:40 the air brakes on the mirage 5 are right in the center of each wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:16:18 it's gonna make the wings look weird
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:18:03 i bike a lot
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:18:19 i live in a very empty subdivision with lots of roads
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:18:22 very windy
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:24:21 is there any way to get this type of wing control setup to not have a seizure when going fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:24:34 where one motor2 is m2m and the other is servo
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:24:43 i do not anymore
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:24:49 it wobbles all the time
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 04:25:28 my question goes unanswered
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:37:17 is this the beginnings of a namnam jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:37:33 the explosive balls look like the start of nam's magnet cannon things
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:37:39 +trapdoor wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:38:32 is he trying to copy the thumbnail or something
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:40:01 roblox players of any game try not be mean to each other challenge
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:40:06 (impossible)
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:40:09 (death threats sent)
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:40:30 what cases would that be
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:40:35 in a plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:41:28 simply power the hover drive with a textbox and motor 2 on servo
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:44:11 to be fair genuine advice almost never gets given
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:44:18 it's always just "you suck delete your build"
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:44:54 angle locking and half motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:45:33 it's just putting a powered motor with the lock function on, moving it slightly, and then collapsing the motorlock tower it's connected to
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:45:56 why is a 30 day player building a namnam jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:46:15 the mig
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:47:23 me when i turn in plane crazy

plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:48:24 timezone issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:49:02 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:49:05 why are you sleepy
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:49:07 in the afternoon
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:49:22 why
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:50:08 make a pvp plane that is also roscale
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:51:52 inside the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:51:54 clearly
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:52:31 time to share my mirage 5 here and get steamrolled
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:52:35 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:52:39 what is the verdict
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:53:21 i need to make space
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:53:28 those half balls are just placeholders for now
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:54:18 is this a jab or a genuine thought
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:55:07 it would have to be nearly inside the fuselage and maybe connected via textbox
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:55:27 also,
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:55:34 i did use angle locking on the intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:55:38 just not the balls
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:55:58 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:56:50 featuring the rocket thruster + jet engine exhaust
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:57:14 it has good handling
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 06:58:02 and no the philippines does not have mirage 5s in its inventory
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:01:06 we have exactly 12 jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:01:14 and 11 prop fighter planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:01:31 but like
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:01:36 the us has bases here
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:01:38 so who cares
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:02:55 this is false
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:03:01 see: all the times we got occupied before
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:03:14 very strategic location
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:06:11 <@792733005177028628> i think it might actually work
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:08:14 see the motor is hidden inside the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:08:32 but it is connected to the aileron via text boxes and cameras
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:08:37 so it doesnt get stuck on anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:08:57 same functionality but no exposed motor2 on the wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:09:03 anyway i will test it later
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 07:09:07 i need to go somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:20:41 gonna start testing
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:21:13 the whitename pc techs 🔥
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:23:21 not if you connect it using text boxes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:23:24 which have no hitbox
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:23:59 we will see
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:28:57 yes ok so there is still a gap
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:29:03 but like
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:29:07 the motor is no longer visible
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:29:09 and it still works
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:31:47 only problem is now your ailerons are more vulnerable to being shot off in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:31:49 but like
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:31:51 just dont get hit
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:31:54 smh my head
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:36:28 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:36:32 get real
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:36:35 hidden motor2s
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 10:36:51 goodbye bulky wings
help 2023-04-21 10:37:54 all you can do is do a better job of hiding them inside the build
creations-chat 2023-04-21 10:42:47 i hid the motor2s inside the fuselage and connected them to the control surface using text and cameras, now the wing doesnt have a motor2 on the tip
creations-chat 2023-04-21 10:53:41 cant, if i do, then the wings will rub against each other and get jammed
creations-chat 2023-04-21 11:20:03 control surfaces are less versatile and smaller
creations-chat 2023-04-21 11:29:58 moving parts give more dopamine 👍
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:43:27 no idea what that is
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:44:11 rip bozo
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:46:13 step 1: cover yourself in cameras
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:47:26 just go faster than like 600 studs
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:48:34 what is mach 2 in this game
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:48:37 2000 sps?
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:48:50 do you even need to go at 2000 sps
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:51:04 how
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:51:09 how are you lagging at 1k sps
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:51:33 even me with my beaten up laptop that cant run more than 2 chrome tabs can go that speed with a 1010 block build
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:52:21 do you have like a ton of deactivated trail blocks in your build
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:52:58 i have 6
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:53:07 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:54:00 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:54:13 i have like 1 motorlock tower with 7 branching off of it
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:56:25 i have another plane with more motors in it and it can also go fast without tanking my fps
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:56:36 are you using trail blocks in the motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:56:50 im not 100% sure but i think they contribute a lot to fps lag even if they're not on
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:59:09 are you using them like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:59:22 if so then maybe dont,
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 11:59:34 and instead replace with wings or cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:00:48 then idk
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:01:06 im a whitename go ask someone else
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:03:07 is there a roblox app shortcut that forces you out of a game
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:03:15 i keep randomly getting sent to the app homepage
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:03:34 also screw the desktop app why did they have to add it to the web version
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 12:56:18 this is why you make guided missiles and not kamikaze planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:29:19 on the mirage 5 wikipedia page

help 2023-04-28 05:28:09 if you have too much lift in the front of your plane/too much weight in the back, then it will wobble up and down at speeds past ~300. If you have too many horizontal wings near the front it will wobble side to side, and if you have too many of either in the back then controls will stiffen up and you will start wobbling too
help 2023-04-28 05:28:31 make space for adding or subtracting wing panels inside your plane so you can tune it
help 2023-04-28 05:28:40 and make sure your controls aren't super sensitive

creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:27:14 do you understand that if something is motorlocked inside of another block, you can’t make it move using motor 2s or it will break the angle lock?
creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:31:34 let’s use my mirage 5’s canopy as an example. It’s noclipped inside the nose because of angle locking. do you think this can be made to open?
creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:33:39 have you noticed that his canopy is also slightly noclipped into the body of the plane using motorlocks? how do you suppose he would make it open without breaking everything?

creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:24:49 gotta get the latest pc with the best specs just to get 5% less physics lag in plane crazy 👍 thank you rickje
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:27:12 i would build more pvp oriented builds but the current meta is just 360 maneuverability with instant turning and the ability to stop midair then proceed to go at 13k studs per second, which leads to all pvp getting dominated by those stupid fucking balls with guns and rockets on them


(and also i can’t even play pc anymore because my launch fps dropped to 10 a week ago out of nowhere 🤩)

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 06:07:03 i wasnt here in the winter event
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 06:07:11 event(s)
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 06:09:39 you have to forfeit your dollars to rickje now
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 06:16:21 should I add droptanks
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 07:06:18 good helicopters with good pilots are deadly
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 07:06:31 though they’re rare
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 07:06:47 most helicopter pilots just hover in place and die
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 07:07:14 thinking of making a working magazine for a tnt cannon
creations-chat 2023-05-14 08:42:28 they already are half cylinders

wait which ones are you talking about
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 08:56:33 you have to make sure you plan out where you put every motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 08:56:45 i always try to stuff them inside the fuselage as much as possible
help 2023-05-14 08:58:07 if you have motorlocks, try adding extra wing panels to the front end of the plane
help 2023-05-14 08:58:27 if that makes it worse then you need to remove them and instead add more wing panels in the back
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 08:59:40 just don’t put motorlocks on the outside of the plane it’s really quite simple <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:00:01 seriously though i don’t get how some people end up with like 8 motors just hovering outside their plane
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:11:35 it never is
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:11:42 there is always a way to put the lock somewhere else
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:12:20 look at this complete mess right here
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:12:41 all those motorlocks and angle locks fit inside the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:13:26 the closest things to exposed motors are the motor2s that move the control panels
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:13:58 which are also hidden somewhat
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:15:47 my point is: if someone like me can hide motorlocks then anyone can
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 09:39:54 just paint the motors and they wont clip through the paint of the body
help 2023-05-14 10:50:48 if you're tilting upwards then you either need to remove weight in the back or add weight in the front
help 2023-05-14 10:51:08 or if you want to fiddle with the wings and risk making it wobble again then you can remove some wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:01:29 have people made player tracking missiles using game glitches yet or is it all just hearsay
help 2023-05-14 12:02:50 you’ll have to suffer through trial and errol then. Just keep adding or subtracting wings in the rear and front until you’ve removed the wobble
help 2023-05-14 12:03:04 you’ll get there if you go at it long enough
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:03:49 hide the cheese grater wings and it might be salvageable
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:06:02 hi luca

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:06:50 why are you here
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:09:01 you can actually motorlock wing panels/trapdoors on top of control surfaces and they’ll still function fine

help 2023-05-14 12:14:53 if i can get a 1400~ block jet to go 1500 sps without wobbling then you can get your jet to not wobble too
help 2023-05-14 12:14:57 you can do it
help 2023-05-14 12:15:14 just
help 2023-05-14 12:15:17 it might take a while
help 2023-05-14 12:16:36 see if you can pull that off then surely the tiny one should be a piece of cake
help 2023-05-14 12:17:56 
help 2023-05-14 12:18:07 all the wing panels you can see there are for stabilization
help 2023-05-14 12:18:47 they don’t have to be on the actual wings of the plane you can just stuff them inside the nose or fuselage using motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:27:55 if you want you can just stack a rocket thruster and jet engine (size depending on you) on top of each other via motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:28:39 the other way is to angle lock some control panels/wing panels/trapdoors
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:28:44 into a circle
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:31:26 i just use the jet engine+rocket thruster method
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:31:48 because 1: no need to worry about drag lift and the wobble that causes
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:32:00 and 2: it’s always gonna be rounder than the wing panel method
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:37:05 move the jet engine back
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:37:11 i mean forwards
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:37:14 by a block
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 12:37:20 and maybe reverse it if you want
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 16:12:45 man the f-14 is huge
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 16:12:52 are any of the recent f-14 builds even to scale
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 16:13:02 look at the size of this thing
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 16:13:14 you could fit like 3 people in each intake
creations-chat 2023-05-15 05:06:14 aside from emilos’ fictional mirage has anyone made a good mirage in this server
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 07:55:56 i just wish tnt could be detonated in no pvp mode but without damaging anything so i can bring my builds out in public servers without getting blown up by 5 other people
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 08:26:42 kill me now
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 08:27:13 just blow my brains out with a shotgun
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 08:28:48 of course eskeline is the first person to downvote the latest suggestion
creations-chat 2023-05-15 08:30:59 what is that long stick of cameras


wait is that a motor in the middle? don’t tell me it just floats there once you’ve launched and folded everything 😦
creations-chat 2023-05-15 09:42:51 the skeleton appears
help 2023-05-15 09:48:08 just think of each motor block in the motorlock tower as a separate layer
help 2023-05-15 09:48:21 they all collapse together into one single layer when you launch
help 2023-05-15 09:48:49 but if you for example build something connected to one of the motors that is a block higher than the motor it is connected to
help 2023-05-15 09:48:59 then that will also be a block higher than all the other layers
help 2023-05-15 10:54:39 half motorlock a triangle wedge 1x4
help 2023-05-15 10:54:58 the part that sticks out should look like a half triangle wedge 1x2

bug-reports 2023-05-16 00:10:39 have plane crazy’s bugs gotten so bad to the point where paid items are now not working
bug-reports 2023-05-16 00:11:20 he has to *at least* fix this bug right
bug-reports 2023-05-16 00:11:33 this is affecting people who literally paid him money
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 00:11:58 is that on the inside or the outside
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 00:59:06 what am i looking at
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 01:51:45 anyone wanna help me try to hide rear landing gear inside of this
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 01:52:01 i had some before but it was all sticking out by one block
creations-chat 2023-05-16 01:59:47 how do i hide sideways folding landing gear under this thing

and no those aren’t exposed locks those are guns
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:05:27 clearly I have the best mirage 5 in the game (it's the only one)

someone please one up me so i can take notes
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:08:46 it's ever so slightly angle locked so i dont know how i would do that
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:09:10 it's a wing panel+trapdoor thick
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:09:14 
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:09:35 (no those aren't exposed locks those are guns)
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:01 not pro enough do do piston locking sorry
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:08 those are guns!!!
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:10 not locks
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:23 do you want me to remove them
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:33 maybe i should just move them up a bit actually
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:10:36 brb
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:11:09 (proof that they are guns)
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:19:43 <@619312093962829849> really quite shrimple
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:20:25 only visible motors on this plane are the ones for moving the control panels
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:20:52 you mean the droptanks?
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:20:54 yes do it
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:21:25 "downvoted cause the missiles are too chunky"
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:21:34 -said in reference to the fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:23:27 yummy heat signature/radar signature
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:23:46 i really just need good landing gear and maybe ideas for armaments for this
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:24:29 missiles are gonna be hard because i dont have sparklers
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:25:19 anyway what are your criticisms
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:26:02 what about mr expert over there
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:26:26 keep in mind i am missing rear landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:26:33 because i have no idea how to fit it inside
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:26:58 thinking of just making it a bunch of text panels
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:27:04 with circle emojis
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:27:13 so i can make it noclip through stuff
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:27:30 and then i'll add camera blocks to the tip so the wheels can have hitboxes
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 02:30:24 i wanna hear it
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:44:27 probably just the upvote count honestly

creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:57:15 the deteriorating state of plane crazy due to rickje’s seeming apathy towards the game, which has caused many game breaking bugs to arise: https://media.tenor.com/eE2OLGiBR-QAAAPo/transitions-kinemaster.mp4
creations-chat 2023-05-16 03:00:00 which was scheduled to be released a year ago, and since then we have not seen sneak peeks or any dev communication aside from a few offhand comments in general
creations-chat 2023-05-16 03:03:27 i just want to at least see a message from him, that’s all

communication is very important

and also jesus how long can it possible take, we’ve already seen chiseled cheese make flightpoint in a couple of months and yet rickje already has the base game to work iff of and he still isn’t done
creations-chat 2023-05-16 03:05:33 he should have just hired chiseled when flightpoint came about, hell i don’t know why he can’t just find people to help him develop the game
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 03:07:58 I’m gonna be real with you, I have no idea how wasdcore works
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 03:08:12 I’m not up to date with most new techs

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 04:00:55 remove the shovel and it will have 1/4th of the upvotes 💯

creations-chat 2023-05-16 05:08:00 at least when I see eskeline talking nonsense i know he’s not serious

also i recall nuclear linking his tomcat somewhere like 2 days after it was posted because he wanted to reach 180 upvotes

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 05:10:28 plane crazy pvpers when their motorlock gets hit 1 time
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 05:10:35 (the entire plane just exploded)
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 05:13:17 simple: one of your motor2s will randomly decide to fling across the map and your plane will stop working
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 05:13:29 it will do this for absolutely no reason aside from rickje told it to

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:39:19 it looks really jerky
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:45:00 why don’t you try pairing it with namnam’s hover thruster super maneuverability thing
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:45:09 and yes I know it’s namnam but like
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:45:12 it’s kinda cool
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:53:31 <#507673335816126509> yes clearly a very good idea to let every plane crazy player add audios to the game
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 12:53:42 i see absolutely no way this could backfire horribly
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 13:38:23 should i make the wings thicker by maybe a single trapdoor
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 13:39:14 actually no never mind
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 14:18:28 use trapdoors they’re several times lighter
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 14:19:00 just paint the black dots

sacrificed good looking gears for a clean underside when folded 💪

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:43:51 you gotta feed it more plane crazy info to work off of

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:48:48 just open the snipping tool app
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:48:51 then copy the image
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:48:53 then paste it here
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:49:08 watch I'll send a picture of my roblox character dying in a few seconds
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:49:22 
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:49:36 you do
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:49:40 you have image perms boy
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:49:58 one up me right now i need to see more mirages

^I'm not being serious lol chill out
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:53:27 what the heeeellll
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:55:31 oh damn you're the guy with the incomplete engine and tail fins that take up half of the plot, thought you looked familiar lol
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:02:04 your mig 29 looks spicy i dont know if i can come out on top

also you can apply for expert role because of the upvotes on that thing, just saying
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:08:24 also here's an older backup save i have of my mirage that had functioning landing gear (looked really clunky imo which is why im trying to hide it now but it had suspension and stuff) it was also really buggy sometimes and the suspension tended to noclip through the wings

honestly it only served to give me somewhat smoother landings than normal

(((also it stuck out a whole block under the plane which didnt look good)))
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:10:27 i think im gonna go ahead and overwrite that save slot now
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:13:04 this?
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:15:15 ohhhhh right yeah i've been meaning to do that for a while lol, i'll go do it now
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:24:11 should i spend the time to motorlock a ton of wedges into it so it's more rounded
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:26:22 delta wings too small for the job on this one i think i'll stick with wedges (also ew flight performance killer)

old version 

I SAID OLD VERSION RAHHH
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:31:00 ok it's less of them being too small and more of i dont want to kill my flight performance

also here's the sideview <@912065912658608190>
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:34:39 i already spent the effort to hide the motors that move them how in the world am i gonna hide the gaps
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:36:50 problem is they are connected to the same angle lock as the entire wing so they have to move with it (though i guess i could try to add more motorlock towers directly on the wing maybe)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:38:52 also this is the space that i have to work with pre-launch lol

anyway see you in 10 minutes ill try to move it in with motorlocks
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:51:30 <@912065912658608190> <@467459282250629120> alright that was way easier than i thought it would be now i just have to mirror it and hide the last gap
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:56:31 oh my goodness gracious why didnt i do this earlier
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:58:46 actually made such a huge difference lol what was i doing this whole time
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:00:16 should have hidden the gaps ages ago
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:00:23 night and day difference ong
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:00:54 yes it does! i actually thought friction might mess it up but turns out nope
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:03:01 picture of both flaps moving in opposite directions
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:32:35 <@912065912658608190> <@467459282250629120> these flaps good enough for the two of you?
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:42:11 surely if the f-62 whatever guy can have no motorlocks on his f-14 wings then you can too

also wow since when did he leave
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:44:21 <@912065912658608190> alright they're (the flaps) a bit stiff now
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 17:52:13 is that in the experts vip server or what
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:01:55 because there is now no gap between the wings and the flaps, they’ll sometimes stiffen up before moving properly
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:04:25 what do you mean inside or outside, also i tried the ice and it made my motor 2s freak out for some reason so i reverted it
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:06:51 both the ailerons and flaperons (if that’s what they’re called on delta wings) and the rudder started twitching like crazy when i made them ice
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:48:30 honestly i think you should go without the camo it makes it look like someone built it in minecraft
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:53:43 yes
creations-chat 2023-05-16 19:10:42 yes, why wouldnt they how else would i control it lol
creations-chat 2023-05-16 19:20:02 magic (text boxes and cameras that extend outside the plane as seen in this outdated photo)

bluesclues tells me that apparently everyone does this
creations-chat 2023-05-16 19:22:04 just ignore it 👍

bug-reports 2023-05-17 09:10:51 rickje issue
creations-chat 2023-05-17 09:52:35 why does the space fighter have ailerons and airbrakes
creations-chat 2023-05-17 10:28:11 removed the copium landing gear and instead tried to hide the motors better
creations-chat 2023-05-17 11:59:43 managed to stuff the wheels inside the fuselage yipee
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:01:58 it's for adding a separate color under the wings without killing my flight performance
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:07:32 yeah... what else would they be, disconnectors? anyway here's what both sides look like
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:09:38 amazing, now give me helpful criticism so i can do better and we can have a productive conversation
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:12:05 ok aside from the poopoo fart rocket thruster exhaust which i am fully aware of what exactly should i do here

and yes that fabric ball is a parachute
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:14:47 time to go stare at mirage 5 stock photos, 3d models and blueprints for a few minutes then, also is the color too flat?
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:34:04 ah the classic trapdoor copium (i tell this to myself everyday)
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 12:54:34 no you SUCK and you're GARBAGE!!1

bug-reports 2023-05-18 02:52:50 would this be a rick issue or a mattadak issue
bug-reports 2023-05-18 02:54:10 simply forfeit your money to rickje and buy a vip server 😃
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:26:54 use a trapdoor locking mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:27:13 or if you want it to be more secure then use powered motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:27:38 the latter will require more time spent aligning the two but it would be more secure
bug-reports 2023-05-18 03:29:41 truly a whitename moment for me
bug-reports 2023-05-18 03:30:18 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:34:30 i was able to make it work before
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:34:35 can i see what you tried
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:39:49 it’s kinda hard to say if i have no idea what your situation looks like
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:40:00 and also I’m a whitename go ask someone with a role
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:49:59 anyway why don't you try these
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:50:18 trapdoors highlighted in green open and close while the red ones stay static
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:50:37 build one on one vehicle and the other on the second vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:50:53 you can open and close the green trapdoors and then align them before closing them again
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:51:17 the only downside is that if you stop suddenly or turn super fast then it gets disconnected
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:54:21 as in i made the system shown above work before
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:54:34 i used it to make reloadable missiles
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:55:34 also, for this I suggest giving the trapdoors different keybinds so you can open them individually
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:55:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:55:58 it's not a perfect mechanism by any means
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:00:59 as in stop the turret from moving or what
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:01:23 just set it to toggle if it's m2m and have a dedicated toggle key for it
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:04:13 if you toggle the motor off then it will freeze and not follow the mouse
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:04:24 just make sure it isnt on servo mode
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:21:49 of course you can lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:21:54 you only need one key to change it
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:23:16 yeah you can rebind them
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 04:23:24 they dont have to be r and f
creations-chat 2023-05-18 05:24:52 the one that is right there in creations
creations-chat 2023-05-18 06:22:05 clearly you haven't seen peak f-16 intake before

it's gotta be wider than the plane by at least 1.5x as you can see
creations-chat 2023-05-18 08:01:47 good question maybe I should build it as my next plane
creations-chat 2023-05-18 08:21:41 skill issue (yeah I know it's fine lol)

help 2023-05-18 12:51:35 it’s just
help 2023-05-18 12:51:43 motor 1 with powered and lock options
help 2023-05-18 12:51:52 and then you attach it to a motorlock tower
help 2023-05-18 12:52:05 and then you attach the blocks you want to angle to the motor 1
help 2023-05-18 12:52:12 and then you move the motor 1
help 2023-05-18 12:52:19 then you collapse the motorlock tower
help 2023-05-18 12:52:33 and then the blocks you moved using the motor 1 are still in the same position
help 2023-05-18 12:52:38 so now you have a custom angle
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 12:54:44 it’s just two layers what
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 12:56:56 did it here with my mirage 5 with just trapdoors on the bottom
help 2023-05-18 13:06:04 1. motor has lock option but is still powered
2. motor is then attached onto a motorlock tower
3. put blocks onto motor
4. move motor
5. collapse motorlock tower
6. free angle!!!
help 2023-05-18 13:06:54 what in the what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 13:07:38 what exactly are you trying to do
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 13:07:47 is rocket right are you trying to put it on the flaps
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 13:08:16 this is out of my area of expertise

creations-chat 2023-05-18 15:40:31 yipee
help 2023-05-18 16:43:46 because it’s connected to the rest of the build
help 2023-05-18 16:47:43 isn’t this connected
help 2023-05-18 16:50:09 it doesn’t look that way but there is probably a teeny tiny part of a block connected to something
help 2023-05-18 16:50:14 100%
help 2023-05-18 16:50:28 almost always the case when a motorlock isn’t working
help 2023-05-18 16:50:43 also some blocks have deceptive welding points
help 2023-05-18 16:50:51 (connection points)
help 2023-05-18 16:50:56 like certain half blocks
help 2023-05-18 16:51:03 so just check again

creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:35:02 stubby wings
creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:37:08 ok now tell me if this is good or not (can’t give more angles right now I’m not at home)
creations-chat 2023-05-19 01:39:46 i need a big red circle with arrows pointing to the part you’re talking about (is it this)
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:47:37 hey blues is this still goober

should probably get more angles later
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:50:06 would this work
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:52:16 i sentence you to 500 angle locked trail blocks
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:54:30 anyway better version and round version (no idea what these could be used for but they look nice)
creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:57:13 anyway if it’s a 2 block wide plane you should try angle locking a bunch of 1x4 triangle wedges together for the sharp tip


“no spamming” it was just a gif stupid bot
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:16:14 you can’t do it with motor 2
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:18:42 what else do you think? these are the only motor 2s in the picture. you need to use regular motors with the lock function
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:21:16 you align it manually with blocks, then disconnect the blocks after you align them. Use tnt to delay the collapse of the motorlock tower
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:31:17 the camera is clogging the motorlock
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:36:01 me when the lack of understanding of motorlocks
creations-chat 2023-05-19 04:08:49 i just noticed now but is your tomcat like 3-4 blocks too short

plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:41:39 basically
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:41:45 you use single motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:41:53 (as in one motor with the lock function on)
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:42:05 to move the triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:42:08 by half a block
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 11:42:12 before you rotate it

maybe I need to get more pictures
creations-chat 2023-05-21 05:47:29 before and after

this would have been so much simpler if they would just add cones (how can you not have a cone block in A PLANE GAME???)

creations-chat 2023-05-24 06:59:43 ok my bad

DAILY 2 PIXELS OF TOMCAT PROGRESS
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:09:37 how do you have 4 expert roles
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:12:33 ok so you get a motorlock tower and put tnt on it first so you can choose when to lock the tower, get a powered motor with the lock function, place it on the motorlock tower, connect the blocks you want to angle lock to the powered motorlock, and then when you launch you move the powered motorlock before collapsing the motorlock tower

the blocks that were moved by the powered motorlock will stay at the position you angled them in even when you collapse the tower (if you do it correctly)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:16:12 do not hold the button you use for angling the blocks while you collapse the motorlock tower or it will break your build 👍

also, don’t use motor2 for angling blocks because it does not have a lock setting
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:26:32 photos courtesy of my iphone 7

blue motor is for angle locking, keep the “powered” setting and “lock” settings on

green blocks are the ones being angle locked
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:28:59 when you launch, move the motor and the blocks connected to it to your desired position and then collapse the motorlock tower using tnt/springs/disconnectors. if you do it correctly then the angled blocks should merge with the other blocks in the build and stay like in the third image

obviously this can also be used in situations where you don’t need the angled blocks to merge with other blocks
creations-chat 2023-05-24 09:36:28 the mig 21 is a delta wing, more specifically a tailed delta wing
creations-chat 2023-05-24 09:47:49 which mig21 variant are you trying to build anyway
creations-chat 2023-05-24 09:58:57 ok so do these real life pictures depict a romanian mig-21 with slightly angled wings
help 2023-05-24 09:59:56 paint the bottom or flat sides of the cutters
creations-chat 2023-05-24 10:03:35 also regardless of the wings your vertical stabilizers are just plain wrong
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:02:16 motorlocking:
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:05:34 well it’s the way you’re asking for
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:12:39 it’s only like that for you because you aren’t used to it

not even months, you’ll get used to it in just a few days if you work with it
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:14:59 that’s the spirit

general 2023-05-24 11:21:42 walter white falling gif
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:43:46 if the wheels function and actually make the tank move then I can understand that but if they’re also non-functional then he might as well have just added fake tracks as well

(accidentally uses “as well” twice in the same sentence)
help 2023-05-24 11:45:15 compact reloadable cannons are way too complicated and extremely unreliable
help 2023-05-24 11:45:24 + they are highly impractical
help 2023-05-24 11:46:09 tnt cannons in general as well as block-built missiles are mostly useless past certain speeds because of explosion delay
help 2023-05-24 11:46:26 (as in the explosion radius of the tnt lags behind the actual tnt block)
help 2023-05-24 11:47:52 your best option for a cannon type explosive is to wait 6 months for the winter event so you can get firework launchers
help 2023-05-24 11:48:04 (or just buy it, up to you)
help 2023-05-24 11:48:34 if you really want a tnt cannon your best option is to make a non-reloadable one
help 2023-05-24 11:49:12 also, magnets are the most reliable for propelling the tnt balls
help 2023-05-24 11:49:19 just make the barrel out of ice
help 2023-05-24 11:49:32 (use the paint tool and go to materials)
help 2023-05-24 11:49:45 ah
help 2023-05-24 11:49:59 that would be because you made the magnets too strong
help 2023-05-24 11:50:23 try putting one magnet at the start of the cannon to push the tnt out and then add magnets on the muzzle
help 2023-05-24 11:50:40 the magnets at the muzzle will be the ones doing the launching
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:52:03 can’t the sliding be solved using a bunch of maximum drag hover thrusters
help 2023-05-24 11:52:15 it depends
help 2023-05-24 11:52:28 i can’t go into the game to test right now so you might want to check youtube
help 2023-05-24 11:53:50 yes, mostly because if you make the cannon too big then it will be too heavy for the motors to move it without bugging out
help 2023-05-24 11:54:01 as for accuracy I’m not sure
help 2023-05-24 11:54:21 👍
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:55:16 flip some of the sparklers on the barrel so that you have less squares

no i don’t think it’s a working track it has a bunch of trails motorlocked into it
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:57:48 <@604636023141433365> honestly just paint it and move the fake wheels closer together (maybe make them smaller and then move them closer)

creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:37:40 i changed the hover engine in my mirage to a bunch of rocket thrusters and my fps increased by 10 👍

never using hover thrusters again ong
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:42:46 i can just use conveyors for that anyway
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:45:38 it's just one conveyor on a motor2 ill be fine 

(THE SOUND OF THE ROCKETS IS KILLING ME)

what is it (sorry i cant tell)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:53:55 either rotated wedge 1x2s, regular jet engine, or if you want more angle locking pain then the funny angled wing/control panel
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:59:42 personally i prefer control panels so you can have the nozzle contract when you use afterburner
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:01:49 still applies, just make it 2x2 👍 (angle locking it will be a pain)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:03:57 small on purpose because the moving part on the real thing doesnt stick out that much 👍
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:09:29 yeah i was just giving an example, probably should have said
help 2023-05-24 21:11:12 if you angle lock enough blocks together then you can make it but then you’ll have a bunch of super dense and heavy wheels
help 2023-05-24 21:11:38 it will take you a lot of blocks
help 2023-05-24 21:12:04 it’s like those custom nosecones you’ll see sometimes on builds
help 2023-05-24 21:12:24 they look nice but you just know they kill performance and take up tons of building space

plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:11:48 when i fly my mirage with landing gear stored i have 15-20 fps
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:11:59 but then when i deploy the gears it rises back to normal
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:17:29 flightpoint might as well be 3d modelling

plane-crazy 2023-05-31 08:18:30 g forces in plane crazy 🤯
creations-chat 2023-05-31 08:33:27 seriously answer: if you use motor2s for your control surfaces give them a bigger maximum angle, and put more wing panels in the front of your plane
help 2023-05-31 08:37:07 or just press escape or open roblox chat while holding it
creations-chat 2023-05-31 09:19:03 it is actually roscale (russia cant afford to build full scale su-57s so this demonstrator is all they can muster)

plane-crazy 2023-05-31 16:03:53 maybe a little more considering it can fit 4 people + two huge robots inside

plane-crazy 2023-05-31 17:52:40 right
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 17:55:01 I’m gonna try to make a functioning TARS when i wake up tomorrow
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:29:46 just use an eyedropper tool on a real image 👍
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:30:14 find better images then <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:54 if only plane crazy’s color picker had a slider
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:34:11 like the one in phantom forces
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:36:59 are the israeli factory colors for the mirage 5 (technically the iai nesher whatever same thing) a good look for mine
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:37:03 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:38:00 i am not
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:38:06 i am asking if i should
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:38:45 what do you think then
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:39:42 real stealth aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:41:15 i guess i already have the infrastructure in place to make proper plane camo so why not
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:41:19 i'll do it later
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:41:37 does anyone know how to make the french roundel in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:45:43 or i guess this one would be the greek roundel
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:46:52 i tried motorlocking text together but i got stopped in my tracks by the roblox filter
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:46:58 they really dont like blue circles
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:47:03 or red or black circles
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:47:09 a white circle is perfectly fine funnily enough
creations-chat 2023-06-01 02:05:31 me when i get mad over absolutely nothing (i am a pcc member it is in my blood)
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:06:36 left one looks too dark
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:06:58 try making the left one again but more faded
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:15:23 is the nose in general just too short or do i just need to make the top of the canopy have a larger flat part
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:16:40 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:18:57 then when i eventually post it to <#384025409945337856> people who are thinking of the mirage III or 2000 will say “why is the nose so long?? lmao <:Downvote:490311668556103700> “
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:20:02 ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:20:30 see the difference between us is that you have an expert role and i am a whitename
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:21:41 people will upvote a tutorial plane if it’s posted by someone with an expert role as long as the expert role posting it acts like it’s a joke build or says themselves that it looks bad
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:22:06 anyway i also have to do camo
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:22:17 so it will be a while before i post it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:23:01 later i have real life stuff to do
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:32:35 someone has to make these now
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:34:06 how small is your screen
creations-chat 2023-06-01 03:28:03 <@467459282250629120> 5 centimeters of exposed motorlock!!!
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:30:15 it would still be a lose lose situation because if he does that then everyone will go “BOOO IT’S A BUGGY MESS HOW COULD YOU RELEASE SUCH A BROKEN GAME”
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:11 i have a feeling chiseled cheese is a better developer than rickje
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:14 considering that
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:25 rickje is taking 5 billion years to make a rework of an existing game
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:43 while chiseled made a whole game from scratch on his own without a base game to work on
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:47 in a few months
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:32:11 while also being a teenager, by the way
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:32:16 eat your heart out rickje
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:32:49 i don’t see why he doesn’t just ask chiseled cheese to join the plane crazy dev team
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:33:01 what
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:33:39 was it even a justified lawsuit
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:09 he said that in reference to 2022 summer
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:12 it is now 2023
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:21 can we really trust him to deliver anything at all
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:37 actually wait
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:42 aren’t there devforum logs
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:52 from as recent as april
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:35:02 idk i saw it in one of chiseled cheese’s videos
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:37:38 ok yeah it's at the very start of this video https://youtu.be/ho54jDXlC3k
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:37:46 dev forum logs
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:38:59 maybe we should have been monitoring the dev forums instead of coping in discord
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:39:08 does anyone wanna sift through them and check right now
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:41:28 ah here we go https://devforum.roblox.com/u/rickje139/activity
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:41:36 most recent post is from may 20 i think
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:42:00 looks like he is having trouble making a nice looking ocean
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:42:04 for the new map
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:42:16 i think it's timezone dependant
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:42:25 may 20 for me would be may 19 for you
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:43:12 at least we know he's doing stuff
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:43:19 just wish he would say so in discord
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:44:48 yes live https://devforum.roblox.com/u/rickje139/activity
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:45:29 if he is currently struggling with the water then does that mean he is done with the rest of the game or he is struggling with the basic things
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:45:35 and has nothing else done yet
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:47:21 i wonder if madattak is still helping with plane crazy development
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:49:59 lag machine ocean
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:50:22 at least submarines will be able to have air in them
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:50:27 right
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:50:47 can roblox even handle stuff like this
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:50:49 at all
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:51:08 the "coming this summer" thing was supposed to be summer 2022
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:51:18 they will
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:51:20 supposedly
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:51:28 allegedly
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:02 copium theory: the reason we have no pc1 summer event right now is because rick is gearing up to release pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:06 🤯
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:38 what new tools are even planned for pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:44 i never really checked
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:57 is it just gonna be flightpoint but rickje made it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:53:32 i personally like how limited current pc is because it makes me have to think of how to make certain shapes
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:53:34 but also
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:53:37 quality of life sucks
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:08 they need to make the jetpack free
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:15 it should be a feature not a gamepass
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:16 i hate
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:23 having to maneuver my camera
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:29 into the nooks and crannies of my builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:55:32 question why aren't you currently dunking on the two of us for talking about pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:55:50 it goes against the behaviour of expert roles
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:57:14 also,
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:57:16 i hate
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:57:22 having to move my camera through this
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:57:37 but i don't wanna give up even more robux to buy the jetpack
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:58:09 obligatory "most organized whitename build"
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:58:33 you need to make gears
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 04:11:38 someone will send you a screenshot of rickje saying “Pc2 is cancelled guys”
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 04:11:52 just know that it’s actually this guy
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 04:12:27 if you want to see for yourself if rickje is still working on it go check his posts on roblox devforum
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 04:12:41 his most recent is from may 20
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 04:12:53 talking about mesh deformation oceans and stuff
general 2023-06-01 04:19:21 every time i open general at least 1 person is going on about lgbt people
general 2023-06-01 04:19:31 is that all you guys talk about
general 2023-06-01 04:19:42 on and on with each other about minorities
general 2023-06-01 04:22:21 why are you constantly talking about them then
general 2023-06-01 04:22:54 me omw to talk about a group of people 24/7 (i really don’t care about them)
general 2023-06-01 04:23:37 this is the pcc grindset
general 2023-06-01 04:24:09 say you do not care about something or someone or whatever and then proceed to angrily talk about the thing for 30 minutes
general 2023-06-01 04:24:14 rinse repeat every day
general 2023-06-01 04:25:12 i searched up the word tran and 156 of the results were the word “tranny” or “trannies”
general 2023-06-01 04:25:25 didnt know that you were allowed to just call people slurs in this server
general 2023-06-01 04:25:47 this roblox server about a plane building game
general 2023-06-01 04:27:03 what else are they supposed to do
general 2023-06-01 04:28:11 me when the protesting is protected by civil rights
general 2023-06-01 04:29:30 raaaahh!!! it’s affecting me i don’t like thinking about gay people stop them!!!
general 2023-06-01 04:29:52 shove the problem under the rug where i can’t see it
general 2023-06-01 04:29:56 now!
general 2023-06-01 04:34:06 yes as long as they aren’t racial apparently
general 2023-06-01 04:34:10 try it
general 2023-06-01 04:34:58 i think
general 2023-06-01 04:35:02 you can also say dyke
general 2023-06-01 04:35:07 very good job moderators
general 2023-06-01 04:37:50 also aren’t the police supposed to do something about it
general 2023-06-01 04:38:01 but i guess you can’t rely on police anywhere to do anything
general 2023-06-01 04:40:24 i live in the philippines
general 2023-06-01 04:40:37 the police just throw parties during work hours
general 2023-06-01 04:43:02 actually they are huh
general 2023-06-01 04:43:09 just like
general 2023-06-01 04:43:20 google “protesters blocking traffic” and go to the news section
general 2023-06-01 04:43:37 tons of articles about them getting arrested
general 2023-06-01 04:44:50 and all the articles are about climate protesters
general 2023-06-01 04:55:06 90% here are also violently homophobic
general 2023-06-01 04:55:29 at least that's how it feels every time i open general
general 2023-06-01 04:56:29 maybe it's just chance that every single time i have opened general in the past 2 months that i have stumbled upon a conversation about lgbt people being mentally ill
general 2023-06-01 04:56:38 but yeah it really feels like 90%
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 05:00:43 brain sees cylinder build

general 2023-06-01 05:03:27 10 second discord moderator interaction
general 2023-06-01 05:04:20 ok then: why are the words "tranny" and "dyke" not part of the server's filters
general 2023-06-01 05:06:15 the roblox game genre

general 2023-06-01 05:07:55 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/990261249910640680/1071064208998940672/IMG_5838.gif
general 2023-06-01 05:07:58 oh right
general 2023-06-01 05:08:01 haha embed fail
general 2023-06-01 05:08:34 only now
general 2023-06-01 05:08:51 it warned me for the bad wor
general 2023-06-01 05:08:54 the roblox game genre
general 2023-06-01 05:09:01 i said it one time 3 minutes ago
general 2023-06-01 05:09:49 ok but techmaster
general 2023-06-01 05:09:54 what slurs are filtered
general 2023-06-01 05:09:57 and what slurs are not
general 2023-06-01 05:10:20 i only know the two i mentioned earlier are not filtered
general 2023-06-01 05:11:09 why is dyno so slow in this server anyway
general 2023-06-01 05:11:15 pcc deterioration
general 2023-06-01 05:12:22 no but you can say dyke and tranny
general 2023-06-01 05:12:24 apparently
general 2023-06-01 05:12:40 can you add these two to the filter 🙏
general 2023-06-01 05:13:09 warning!!!
general 2023-06-01 05:14:42 when will pcc go through the "change into a hangout server and pretend it was never a plane crazy server" phase
general 2023-06-01 05:15:13 i was in a server that was almost exactly like this one before
general 2023-06-01 05:15:18 same situation
general 2023-06-01 05:15:22 absent developer
general 2023-06-01 05:15:26 game doesnt exist
general 2023-06-01 05:15:42 and then last year they changed it into a cafe server
general 2023-06-01 05:15:58 and shadow banned everyone who mentioned the game it was originally about
general 2023-06-01 05:16:06 roblox anime game
general 2023-06-01 05:16:11 the crappy jojo one
general 2023-06-01 05:16:14 stand upright
general 2023-06-01 05:16:30 used to be the biggest one and now it doesn't exist
general 2023-06-01 05:16:36 instead someone made a copy of it
general 2023-06-01 05:16:44 using an uncopylocked version
general 2023-06-01 05:17:43 i used to talk in that discord server but then at some point after they turned into a hangout server i decided to get myself shadow banned by mentioning the original game
general 2023-06-01 05:18:02 it's like
general 2023-06-01 05:18:05 eerily similar to pcc
general 2023-06-01 05:18:50 small collection of high ranking members make up the bulk of conversations (small chunk of it was also homophobic rants like in here)
general 2023-06-01 05:19:03 every now and then a whitename comes in and asks "when is stand upright rework coming"
general 2023-06-01 05:19:09 and then the high ranks get mad at them
general 2023-06-01 05:19:29 moderators either don't exist or don't do any moderation
general 2023-06-01 05:20:22 there's a bunch of channels that used to be used for stuff but now serve no purpose (like <#609381270237216768>  in here)
general 2023-06-01 05:20:45 and there were also the same amount of raids that happened in that server that happened here
general 2023-06-01 05:20:58 they're like identical copies of each other but with different games
general 2023-06-01 05:21:45 yeah but is it really
general 2023-06-01 05:22:08 oh also another similarity being that the developer of the game stopped talking after a december
general 2023-06-01 05:22:21 i think it was 2020 idk
general 2023-06-01 05:22:51 only difference being that there were two active devs and one was really talkative but got mad at people talking about the non existent game
general 2023-06-01 05:23:07 instead here we only have rickje since madattak is busy with other things
general 2023-06-01 05:23:25 i really feel like
general 2023-06-01 05:23:32 this server is gonna go down the exact same path that server went down
general 2023-06-01 05:24:43 hell there were even stereotypical discord users in that server that I can draw parallels to people here
general 2023-06-01 05:25:19 it's really like an alternate universe situation
general 2023-06-01 05:26:03 even the coding situation for the developer was that the game was spaghetti coded
general 2023-06-01 05:26:14 and they had to make a rework of the game from the ground up
general 2023-06-01 05:26:21 though
general 2023-06-01 05:26:29 in that server the game also shut down for maintennance
general 2023-06-01 05:26:32 which ended up never ending
general 2023-06-01 05:27:04 maybe plane crazy will also be like that
general 2023-06-01 05:28:17 rickje is working on pc2
general 2023-06-01 05:28:30 no this isn't copium he has devforum posts from as recent as may
general 2023-06-01 05:28:38 https://devforum.roblox.com/u/rickje139/summary
general 2023-06-01 05:28:42 embed fail but whatever
general 2023-06-01 05:29:31 talking about mesh deform oceans and stuff
general 2023-06-01 05:31:58 rickje tried to fight the ocean and lost
general 2023-06-01 05:32:07 now pc2 is delayed indefinitely
general 2023-06-01 05:33:04 did you take me seriously
general 2023-06-01 05:34:04 i think rickje might be having a bit of a priority mismanagement issue
general 2023-06-01 05:34:48 i get the feeling the game itself is done but rick is obsessing over other gameplay features like the mesh deform water
general 2023-06-01 05:34:57 and is unintentionally delaying the release
general 2023-06-01 05:35:27 and also he might be going through a mental crisis because of flightpoint existing
general 2023-06-01 05:35:47 because it was made within a few months
general 2023-06-01 05:35:52 with more features than pc
general 2023-06-01 05:35:55 by a teenager
general 2023-06-01 05:36:05 chiseled cheese made flightpoint in a cave with a box of scraps
general 2023-06-01 05:36:17 meanwhile rickje
general 2023-06-01 05:36:27 is taking 2 years to make a game based off of his already existing game
general 2023-06-01 05:36:32 and is not done yet
general 2023-06-01 05:36:47 i really don't get how he got beat by a teenager who had to start from scratch
general 2023-06-01 05:37:07 when was fp created again
general 2023-06-01 05:38:10 maybe if he ever comes online we should collectively ask him "hey so this teenager beat you by several months and made his game faster than you could make the rework for your existing game"
general 2023-06-01 05:38:31 is this not super funny though
general 2023-06-01 05:39:05 developer takes 2 years to rework game and some kid comes in and makes the rework from scratch within a few months
general 2023-06-01 05:39:15 if it were me i would just quit
general 2023-06-01 05:39:20 if someone told me that
general 2023-06-01 05:40:22 chiseled himself goes up to rickje after pc2 releases later this year and is like "wow hey dude big fan what do you think about my fan game"
general 2023-06-01 05:40:29 rickje looks at it and just leaves the server
general 2023-06-01 05:40:48 fp is just 3d modelling
general 2023-06-01 05:40:56 i dont come to plane crazy to learn 3d modelling
general 2023-06-01 05:42:25 it's more of i like plane crazy's building style more
general 2023-06-01 05:42:55 the triangle and rectangle thing in fp would have me slaving away for weeks trying to perfect every single nook and cranny
general 2023-06-01 05:43:26 meanwhile in plane crazy i see a super weird angle and go "well i mean it's not like i can realistically pull that off" then i go about my day
general 2023-06-01 05:43:44 the mere fact that they are there taunting me
general 2023-06-01 05:43:57 i just know that it wouldnt be good for my mental health if i started fp
general 2023-06-01 05:44:13 relatable
general 2023-06-01 05:44:31 also there's the part about having to start from nothing again
general 2023-06-01 05:44:34 i like my pc builds
general 2023-06-01 05:44:52 if i wanna have more building tools i will wait for pc2 no matter how copium it is
general 2023-06-01 05:45:01 because at least there my builds will (allegedly) carry over
general 2023-06-01 05:45:30 i have 16 days of playtime
general 2023-06-01 05:45:33 in plane crazy
general 2023-06-01 05:45:49 oh
general 2023-06-01 05:45:50 also
general 2023-06-01 05:45:58 fp has like 2 and a half people playing it at any given hour
general 2023-06-01 05:46:20 (slight exaggeration)
general 2023-06-01 05:46:56 if i could somehow port my builds over to fp and modify them with fp's building tools then maybe
general 2023-06-01 05:47:07 the sentimentality is holding me back
general 2023-06-01 05:47:25 anyway the communicator block
general 2023-06-01 05:47:27 how does it work
general 2023-06-01 05:47:34 is it just plane crazy rocket tracking
general 2023-06-01 05:47:41 me too
general 2023-06-01 05:48:05 radar block
general 2023-06-01 05:48:34 also i like how the only gun option is just straight up a gatling gun
general 2023-06-01 05:49:44 still feels like it might as well be pc2
general 2023-06-01 05:50:01 seriously how could rickje fall behind this badly
general 2023-06-01 05:50:52 is his mindset like "i have to finish absolutely every single feature of the game before it releases"
general 2023-06-01 05:51:04 and he ends up infinitely working on more and more things
general 2023-06-01 05:51:16 so he ends up never releasing an alpha test of the game
general 2023-06-01 05:51:40 weren't you talking about it lagging you to death before
general 2023-06-01 05:52:02 dyno moment
general 2023-06-01 05:53:23 since the most rickje dev forum post is about him fixing his mesh deform water
general 2023-06-01 05:53:29 there are two possibilities
general 2023-06-01 05:53:57 1: he is on the finish touches since mesh deform water is obviously not a core gameplay feature and is just a nice extra
general 2023-06-01 05:54:02 and
general 2023-06-01 05:54:16 2: he is struggling to create the basic features of the game and the water is an example
general 2023-06-01 05:55:44 why can't he just ask chiseled to join him in developing pc2
general 2023-06-01 05:56:02 the dude literally made it already
general 2023-06-01 05:56:50 plain crazy
general 2023-06-01 05:57:02 he plays genshin impact
general 2023-06-01 05:57:04 of course he is
general 2023-06-01 05:57:37 all the funds for pc2 are being funneled into his gacha grind
general 2023-06-01 05:58:26 i played it actively up until 2 months ago when the game became too big to fit on my 32gb storage phone
general 2023-06-01 05:59:03 i plan on coming back to it once the new country comes out but until then i think im gonna stay away
general 2023-06-01 05:59:30 also yeah it is
general 2023-06-01 05:59:36 im surprised it could fit on my phone at all
general 2023-06-01 05:59:44 and run at 60 fps
general 2023-06-01 05:59:59 iphone 7 from 2016 runing genshin impact
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:01:00 when will blues make a plane that is not 1 wide 🙏
general 2023-06-01 06:01:43 kid named tomorrow:
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:31 i am yet to run out of storage space
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:45 i only have 16 total days of ingame time
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:52 so naturally
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:02:58 i have a lot of slots left
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:03:35 great now i have to log in
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:03:50 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:03:52 ok nvm i found a picture
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:04:04 i still have to make the canopy slightly longer
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:04:08 and then do the camo
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:04:28 never gonna post it to creations 💪
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:04:35 whitename for life
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:05:23 pcc members when they see 5 text boxes on a plane (it's suddenly worthy of 600 upvotes)
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:05:32 lie down
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:06:26 it makes me want to blow my brains out because of one really stupid part about it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:06:34 for some reason if i retract the gears my fps drops to 15
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:06:52 so if i want to fly with regular fps i have to take them off
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:07:00 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:07:17 do i like
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:07:24 use a powered motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:07:32 and then align it using cameras
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:07:40 also do camera blocks cause fps drops
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:08:05 only on toggle right
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:08:14 cause
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:08:23 i use servo motors for my ailerons
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:03 control surface is so jerky
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:06 no what
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:07 ew
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:46 do camera blocks cause fps drops
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:51 i do
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:09:52 w
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:10:06 raaaaahhh
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:11:22 you have no idea how close i came to having an aneurysm whe i found out that all my fps lag was caused by my landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:12:45 anyway guh
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:13:37 prepare for more pictures
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:14:26 mirage my beloved
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:14:51 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:15:00 through pain
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:15:02 that's how
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:15:39 this angle right here was the cause of many headaches
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:16:21 it's not even something people would care about but for some reason i went through with making it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:16:30 it like goes upwards and inwards
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:16:39 so i had to make the angle lock move two ways
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:18:11 i only did it because i asked for feedback here and some guy pointed out my lack of angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:18:20 i thing it was bushnoises
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:19:27 because of the super specific angle i have it at there are a ton of blocks that fly away when i launch
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:20:38 also the drop tanks can be dropped
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:20:50 idk i thought it would be fun
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:21:30 bottom is also very flat
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:21:43 as it should be
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:21:49 if only motors could be made invisible
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:23:10 magnet lock...
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:23:22 is it worth it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 06:25:03 i have posted so many pictures of my mirage here that someone could probably take some and post it to <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-06-01 06:27:05 how many pings is that
general 2023-06-01 06:27:18 381
general 2023-06-01 06:27:59 this is my ping count whenever i say the words "plane crazy two" in pcc

general 2023-06-01 06:32:19 canda uses british english
general 2023-06-01 06:32:21 canda
general 2023-06-01 06:32:26 minor spelling mistake

general 2023-06-01 06:33:43 because you are a whitename
general 2023-06-01 06:33:45 whitename
general 2023-06-01 06:34:47 am i a stereotypical whitename
general 2023-06-01 06:35:36 whitename (derogatory)
general 2023-06-01 06:36:58 pcc lore
general 2023-06-01 06:37:02 but you didn't have to cut me off
general 2023-06-01 06:38:26 the escalation of events
general 2023-06-01 06:38:35 that is not what whitename means here at all
general 2023-06-01 06:38:41 what did you think they were saying
general 2023-06-01 06:39:02 he thinks that people are calling him whitename because his name is nate and it sounds like a white person name
general 2023-06-01 06:39:16 that is not
general 2023-06-01 06:39:18 what whitename means
general 2023-06-01 06:39:21 in this server
general 2023-06-01 06:39:43 people say whitename to refer to new members who have no server roles and act dumb
general 2023-06-01 06:39:48 or clueless
general 2023-06-01 06:40:07 okay but you have no server roles that have a color
general 2023-06-01 06:40:13 therefore your username is white
general 2023-06-01 06:40:17 therefore
general 2023-06-01 06:40:19 you are a whitename
general 2023-06-01 06:40:21 just like i am
general 2023-06-01 06:41:16 i started plane crazy last year and then stopped after 2 weeks
general 2023-06-01 06:41:20 then came back to it march this year
general 2023-06-01 06:41:24 and joined this server
general 2023-06-01 06:41:27 (hell)
general 2023-06-01 06:42:24 i remember seeing the whitename atat gif being used in so many other discord servers without knowing it came from here
general 2023-06-01 06:42:29 do you guys know that
general 2023-06-01 06:42:33 the whitename activity gif
general 2023-06-01 06:42:36 it's used everywhere
general 2023-06-01 06:42:43 in like the phantom forces discord server
general 2023-06-01 06:43:31 why are there so many helltaker reaction images in this server anyway
general 2023-06-01 06:44:33 it really is
general 2023-06-01 06:44:38 but it can be funny sometimes
general 2023-06-01 06:44:46 and also there is good feedback (sometimes)
general 2023-06-01 06:44:52 so i stay
general 2023-06-01 06:45:23 mostly what i find in <#497142796961054721> is someone ranting about lgbt people
general 2023-06-01 06:46:14 everyone here is either gay or homophobic or both
general 2023-06-01 06:46:28 yes

general 2023-06-01 06:57:22 crazy
general 2023-06-01 06:59:08 i remember
general 2023-06-01 06:59:13 one time i opened general
general 2023-06-01 06:59:33 and just like every other time i open general there is someone ranting about lgbt people
general 2023-06-01 06:59:52 but this time there was also a guy celebrating trans people having a higher suicide rate
general 2023-06-01 07:01:10 aren’t you also one of those people
general 2023-06-01 07:01:40 i remember seeing your builds and going “wow that guy has nice builds” and then i see you talking
general 2023-06-01 07:01:46 and then i go “wow that guy probably hates me”
general 2023-06-01 07:02:43 bot central
general 2023-06-01 07:02:45 what about it
general 2023-06-01 07:02:54 oh
general 2023-06-01 07:04:03 i play almost exclusively in my private server 👍
general 2023-06-01 07:05:12 is the key to making huge builds like that really just reverse motorlocking

general 2023-06-01 07:06:28 pollution
general 2023-06-01 07:07:15 ok but can it sink dramatically after being damaged
general 2023-06-01 07:07:47 right
general 2023-06-01 07:07:57 so im assuming almost every big build like that
general 2023-06-01 07:08:01 is hollow
general 2023-06-01 07:08:02 ys
general 2023-06-01 07:08:03 yes
general 2023-06-01 07:08:18 because the inner space would have been motors before launching
general 2023-06-01 07:08:54 would it be more efficient to build a cross-account build or a reverse motorlock build
general 2023-06-01 07:08:58 if you were to make something big
general 2023-06-01 07:09:36 i played war thunder because i wanted to fly in a mirage and now i am stuck in tier 4

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:41:45 ignore the weird texture inside it's just the half ball 2x2 acting weird
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:42:16 i just need to fix this
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:43:19 i didnt follow any roscaler guide things
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:43:25 just kinda eyeballed it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:43:27 so i have no clue
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:43:52 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:44:16 where do i even start
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:44:20 wanna just
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:44:21 hold on
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:44:55 wait i will build a block reference next to it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:47:34 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:47:37 wingtip covers 3 blocks but whatever
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:48:43 33~ ish blocks long i think
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:50:14 <:empty:794431705070174238> hold on
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:53:47 😍 it's right
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:54:33 just over 17 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:55:01 i see
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:55:34 like compared to the roblox character or what
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:55:40 i thought 1 wides were considered mini
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:56:18 though i guess you can't really use roblox characters as a scale refence since
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:56:25 they're not proportional to human bodies
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:56:52 i eyeball it based on pictures of people standing next to the plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:58:00 for example since in the case of the mirage if someone were to stand under it their head would pretty much bump the underside i made it like that
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:58:05 though roblox characters
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:58:07 are kinda short
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:58:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:58:41 not good for scaling kinda annoying
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:59:05 character too wide for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:59:13 sausage arms sticking out
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 15:59:22 (the one thing stopping me from making 1 wides)
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:02:25 also i compare how big the pilot looks in the cockpit to my roblox character
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:02:28 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:02:36 which reminds me
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:02:39 i have to like
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:02:43 move the pilot seat forwards
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:03:16 the most prestigious rank
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:03:38 watch out he's gonna come in and tell you to die

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:07:40 plus i have general muted
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:07:45 i only started talking there today
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:09:46 also,
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:10:08 right motor 2s cause fps drops because the game doesnt register that they arent moving objects even after they come to a stop
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:10:16 the same applies to parachute blocks right
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:10:35 since the physical parachute model is inside the box even when you haven't used it yet
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:10:52 man i really wanted to have a drag chute
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 16:11:04 i had it before but i removed it to try and reduce my frame drops

general 2023-06-02 05:32:39 someone post the info picture
general 2023-06-02 05:38:14 just don't use actual wing panels for your helicopter's lift
general 2023-06-02 05:38:40 it's better to just use a bunch of rocket thrusters/propeller engines hidden inside
general 2023-06-02 05:38:42 oh
general 2023-06-02 05:38:56 ok
general 2023-06-02 05:38:56 so the rotors are just made of signs
general 2023-06-02 05:38:59 uh
general 2023-06-02 05:39:09 what do you mean by wobbling btw
general 2023-06-02 05:40:11 i do both
general 2023-06-02 05:40:45 does it use locked motors to fold or motor 2
general 2023-06-02 05:41:04 if it's motor 2 then that's your problem
general 2023-06-02 05:41:15 yup
general 2023-06-02 05:41:18 there's your problem
general 2023-06-02 05:41:47 only rickje knows
general 2023-06-02 05:42:20 doesn't mean it's impossible to add things
general 2023-06-02 05:42:21 just
general 2023-06-02 05:42:25 not completely new features
general 2023-06-02 05:42:44 but im pretty sure adding a lock function to an existing block should be possible
general 2023-06-02 05:44:02 look;
general 2023-06-02 05:44:07 i hate helicopters
general 2023-06-02 05:44:21 making them at least
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 05:48:56 i didnt even realize how many exposed motorlocks there were on the bottom until these pictures
general 2023-06-02 05:59:34 just go faster than 300 sps
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:08:35 what scale are you building at
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:09:13 i technically did for my miragw
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:09:36 started with this
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:10:04 then kept improving it
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:20:05 <@467459282250629120> wait so your f-5 is roscale right
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:20:08 1:1
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:21:02 according to the 1 block = .70m
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:24:29 cause like
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:24:32 it feels small
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:25:08 every time someone shows me what 1:1 is according to roscale it looks too small
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:25:32 the guy in rhe pic can crawl into the intake if he tries
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:25:50 even if you scaled your roblox character
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:26:01 to be accurate to human proportions
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:26:27 that intake is a cylinder big
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:26:51 am i crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:26:59 i swear it’s too small
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:27:50 i explained
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:27:57 !!!
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:28:08 wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:28:15 so what is roscale based on
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:28:31 guh
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:29:19 in my head roblox characters are basically just really short
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:29:21 not fat
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:29:30 so i build based on that
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:30:49 look, heads look the same size in both pictures
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:30:56 though i need to move the seat forwards still
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:35:06 ok so 1:1 and roscale are two different things
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:35:07 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:35:14 ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 06:35:17 i get it now

plane-crazy 2023-06-05 19:47:50 you set the motor to powered and lock
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 19:49:06 (fake)

plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:17:04 this happens every now and then
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:17:10 sometimes plane crazy just decides
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:17:15 that im not allowed to spawn my mirage
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:17:20 because fuck me i guess
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 13:31:59 so what, because of rickje's apathy and incompetency as a game developer, I now can't spawn my best build, which I put a lot of time into?

general 2023-06-06 14:37:31 is he serious when he says all of that
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:42:09 that’s not practical
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:42:23 so you’re saying just let them send a million gore images so that you know to ban them?
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:42:33 it’s just level 3 lmao

plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:43:32 it’s a safety precaution
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:43:43 what happens if someone decides to raid the server

plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:46:47 which one
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:09 buster tell me now
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:10 you
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:14 are an expert yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:20 which nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:40 skull
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:52 regardless,
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:47:53 which one do you think is better
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:48:05 left looks more plane crazy right looks smoother
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:48:50 raaaahhh if only there was a 1/4th cylinder
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:48:58 i have to
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:49:03 half lock a half cylinder
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:49:06 to get this result
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:50:17 that's what ive been saying to myself aaauugggghhh how do i choose

problem with the cylinder is that i cant replicate it on the rest of the plane's curves because there's no space to build it
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:54:28 can't do that because of this, also <@814978152672657458> if i were to try and smooth out the tip i would have to angle lock 500 trail blocks into a cone

plane-crazy 2023-06-06 18:55:03 what?
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:56:30 can't do camera locking on top of motorlock and angle lock <:shock:1098116005252841503>
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:59:30 because most of us act dumb, either because of being a kid or because of not reading the <#925522972586967092> channel before asking a question

or because of getting really mad after receiving criticism (though sometimes the "criticism" is just bullying in which case it's kinda understandable to get mad)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:02:01 pcc mindset means that instead of correcting someone or helping them you yell at them and send the whitename activity gif (cue eskeline coming in to reply to me and send the whitename activity gif)
general 2023-06-06 19:06:46 stop asking people to rp with you pleas
general 2023-06-06 19:06:53 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:07:09 look who's talking
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:41:06 yes because rockets phasing through enemies and tracking the sun is very fun
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:43:21 anyway canopy frame should i go through with it (if i want to build the rest i will have a lot of angle locking in my future)
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:47:14 i think he mistook you for the other guy who was asking for rp
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:47:31 similar black and white pfp
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:49:38 why are you asking me

help 2023-06-06 20:53:17 what is this
help 2023-06-06 20:53:39 you gotta move in inwards
help 2023-06-06 20:54:01 are you sure
help 2023-06-06 20:54:08 let me join you are you in a public server
help 2023-06-06 20:54:39 by inwards i mean towards the fuselage
help 2023-06-06 20:55:22 yeah
help 2023-06-06 20:55:26 or or
help 2023-06-06 20:55:32 because i think what’s happening is that
help 2023-06-06 20:55:44 when the motorlock tower collapses
help 2023-06-06 20:56:00 the motor 2s for your vertical stabilizer twitch upwards a bit
help 2023-06-06 20:56:09 which causes the wing panels to clip into the motor
help 2023-06-06 20:56:37 you can prevent this by welding the stabilizer to another block to prevent it from twitching using tnt/springs
help 2023-06-06 20:56:53 then disconnect/explode the tnt/springs to unweld the stabilizer
help 2023-06-06 20:58:53 (wouldn’t be a problem if rickje would get around to fixing motor 2s from being incredible weak but oh well)
general 2023-06-06 20:59:14 what the draken
help 2023-06-06 20:59:48 just do what i mentioned
help 2023-06-06 21:00:11 stick the vertical stabilizer to another stationary block using tnt or springs and then disconnect them after the motorlock tower collapses
help 2023-06-06 21:00:15 see if it works
help 2023-06-06 21:00:29 cause i can see in the image that it’s forcefully tilted upwards by a bit
general 2023-06-06 21:02:15 every delta wing ever
general 2023-06-06 21:02:19 (i love delta wings)

help 2023-06-06 21:10:14 <@602922097513201676> something is still blocking it
help 2023-06-06 21:10:21 probably from somewhere higher in the motorlock tower
help 2023-06-06 21:10:57 yes
help 2023-06-06 21:10:58 text has no hitbox
help 2023-06-06 21:16:16 honestly the only way is to either move it a whole block or use pistons to move it .1 studs
help 2023-06-06 21:16:19 or
help 2023-06-06 21:16:22 if you want
help 2023-06-06 21:16:31 you could reconstruct it using angle locked disconnectors
help 2023-06-06 21:16:50 which would move it to the right slightly and give space for the vertical stabilizer
help 2023-06-06 21:16:58 yeah i know
help 2023-06-06 21:19:05 disconnectors/trapdoors whichever you prefer
help 2023-06-06 21:19:10 angled to look like wing panels

help 2023-06-06 21:37:50 just make sure the piston has both toggle and lock and make sure to wait a few seconds after extending it before collapsing the motorlock tower

help 2023-06-09 11:35:26 hmm
help 2023-06-09 11:37:41 i would say it needs angle locking but there should be a simpler answer than that
help 2023-06-09 11:38:23 what’s the wedge on top of the space
help 2023-06-09 11:38:34 is it 1x4
help 2023-06-09 11:39:19 what if you reduced it to 1x3 and used some triangle block wedges in combination with 1x3 or 1x4 triangle wedge

general 2023-06-10 00:59:12 clearly it’s neon brown
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:00:15 you should learn motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:00:39 next step would be to learn angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:02:04 also, tnt might seem more convenient than using springs or disconnectors (it is) but you will regret using it after realizing that you can’t use it in non pvp servers
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:02:32 what
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:02:57 why are they bending
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:05 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:20 wait what
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:26 no i meant the thing that delays
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:30 the tower
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:32 from collapsing
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:40 not the cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:03:50 if you want to use angle locks then yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:04:08 i think ive sent pictures of a demonstration here before let me look for them
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:06:03 ok here i found them
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:06:15 blue motor is angle/rotation lock motor
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:06:23 powered and lock settings on
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:06:33 green blocks are the blocks you want to angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:06:54 what you do is delay the motorlock tower from collapsing using tnt or springs or disconnectors like shown in the picture
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:07:10 you move the blocks you want to move using the powered motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:07:18 then you explode the tnt
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 01:07:21 and it sticks like that

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 05:59:34 because it looks bad
general 2023-06-10 08:16:20 this doesn't really apply when you remember that plane crazy is dysfunctional 70% of the time unless you have nasa wifi
general 2023-06-10 08:16:36 and a 10k dollar pc
general 2023-06-10 08:17:20 not very rewarding to see a build that you worked tirelessly on for days end up not working a week after you made it because another game feature stopped working properly
general 2023-06-10 08:19:00 half the time it's even the game servers themselves being completely non-functional
general 2023-06-10 08:19:14 where you spawn in the field unable to launch builds or open save slots for no apparent reason
general 2023-06-10 08:19:19 along with everyone else in the server
general 2023-06-10 08:20:17 even when they're awake they don't do anything aside from make fun of people asking for their tickets to be reviewed
general 2023-06-10 08:23:16 mine do too but i still recall fuzzy saying something about ignoring 18 open tickets
general 2023-06-10 08:26:02 stuff like rank request tickets
general 2023-06-10 08:26:13 you have a rank you would know
general 2023-06-10 09:51:20 how do i not instantly die with french vehicles
general 2023-06-10 09:53:20 i agree that there is fun to be had in successfully making something work
general 2023-06-10 09:53:30 yes
general 2023-06-10 09:53:33 you NEED to know it
general 2023-06-10 09:53:41 obtain the knowledge NOW!
general 2023-06-10 09:55:03 also is the grind to top tier faster if i jump ship to the israel tech tree after getting my first rank 4 vehicles
general 2023-06-10 09:55:37 cause like
general 2023-06-10 09:55:41 israel tech tree is tiny
general 2023-06-10 09:55:49 surely the grind to top tier would be faster right
general 2023-06-10 09:56:02 i am aware
general 2023-06-10 09:56:13 israel tech tree starts at rank 4
general 2023-06-10 09:56:28 not yet
general 2023-06-10 09:56:56 so i stick with france then
general 2023-06-10 09:57:24 i saw the stats it looks crazy
general 2023-06-10 09:58:01 for air someone told me the ad4 is the premier grinding plane for france rank 4
general 2023-06-10 09:58:40 why is it the heavy tank when the tank destroyer version has way more armor and a bigger gun
general 2023-06-10 09:59:03 is it just heavy because it's fard and not because it can take a lot of hits
general 2023-06-10 10:00:40 i have just enough to get my first rank 4 plane and crew it but if i bring it into rb im gonna instantly die and go broke
general 2023-06-10 10:12:32 chunky
general 2023-06-10 10:33:29 i am getting sick and tired of flying 10 kilometers just to get pilot sniped without being able to do anything
general 2023-06-10 10:35:16 what else
general 2023-06-10 10:35:30 no other game gives you an experience quite like war thunder's
general 2023-06-10 10:35:54 wow i sure do love driving/flying for 7 minutes and accomplishing absolutely nothing before being one shot killed
general 2023-06-10 10:39:19 forgot to mention

general 2023-06-12 13:18:41 he said it in reference to german engineers
general 2023-06-12 13:21:23 engineering irl: math, years of testing, more math 
plane crazy “engineering”: abusing broken physics engine, crash testing 18374619 times to get a working product
general 2023-06-12 13:22:28 pc needs to have less drag
general 2023-06-12 13:22:46 when i stall i want to fall to the floor not gently float down like a piece of paper
general 2023-06-12 13:23:23 pc logic makes everything with wing panels act like a paper plane
general 2023-06-12 13:23:33 can’t even glide
general 2023-06-12 13:24:11 that’s what I’m saying!!!
general 2023-06-12 13:24:22 i want pc to have g forces
general 2023-06-12 13:24:37 not because muh realism but because i hate
general 2023-06-12 13:24:45 namnam maneuverability jets
general 2023-06-12 13:25:56 i badly want pc2 to have g forces so that all those stupid pvp “jets” instantly crumble to pieces when they do mach 1 cobras
general 2023-06-12 13:26:23 jets in quotes because they’re really just helicopters that move at mach 1
general 2023-06-12 13:27:18 plane crazy pvp “pros” when i tell them to try and make a jet that doesnt use electric fabs to maneuver
general 2023-06-12 13:27:52 i want g forces that have an observable effect on builds
general 2023-06-12 13:30:39 true since most builds would probably have crazy mass since they’re compressed with motorlock
general 2023-06-12 13:31:40 which would cause them to crush themselves under their own weight under any high amount of g force
general 2023-06-12 13:33:25 fly by wire in plane crazy would be m2m
general 2023-06-12 13:33:57 how about just g forces on the player
general 2023-06-12 13:34:27 like just make stupid cobra fans instantly black out when they pull 1000 g turns
general 2023-06-12 13:35:38 they could nerf drones by making them have a reliance on proximity to the player
general 2023-06-12 13:36:27 i am aware
general 2023-06-12 13:36:37 so the solution
general 2023-06-12 13:36:44 turn the pilots into jelly
general 2023-06-12 13:37:10 things like mach 1 cobras are stupid though
general 2023-06-12 13:37:20 and then INSTANTLY recovering from the stall the cobra caused
general 2023-06-12 13:37:55 it angers me to see a guy go from post stall maneuver to transonic flight in like 2 seconds
general 2023-06-12 13:38:37 oh man if they made wing panels have less drag
general 2023-06-12 13:39:00 this thing I’m complaining about would be at least partially solved
general 2023-06-12 13:39:58 but they use wing panels
general 2023-06-12 13:39:59 do they not
general 2023-06-12 13:40:14 motorlocked inside the plane
general 2023-06-12 13:40:39 anything with at least one wing panel will glide to the ground like a piece of paper
general 2023-06-12 13:41:42 not even glide
general 2023-06-12 13:41:47 just float down
general 2023-06-12 13:42:04 because they have so much drag that all forwards movement bleeds off in just a few seconds
general 2023-06-12 13:42:49 now imagine if this wasnt the case
general 2023-06-12 13:42:55 we could have gliders
general 2023-06-12 13:43:21 cobra addicts would crash and burn every time they did their top gun maverick bs
general 2023-06-12 13:44:11 (can you tell i hate people who use post stall maneuvers over and over)
general 2023-06-12 13:45:42 this is now the 4th time i have seen you send a video of your b17
general 2023-06-12 13:45:46 it gets old

general 2023-06-12 13:47:11 😃
general 2023-06-12 13:47:45 the trails with helium on them are for angle locking
general 2023-06-12 13:48:07 (they fly off after I’m done👍)
general 2023-06-12 13:49:13 how do you get it to drift on the turns like that
general 2023-06-12 13:49:39 real
general 2023-06-12 13:50:11 i see
general 2023-06-12 13:51:06 hover drives make my fps drop to 15 on bigger builds so i can’t even use them if i want to
general 2023-06-12 13:51:31 rat helicopter
general 2023-06-12 13:52:20 how do i make this lighter
general 2023-06-12 13:53:37 all the trails you can see in that picture disconnect when i explode the tnt

general 2023-06-12 13:54:56 i am addicted to motor 2 control surfaces because they make flying feel more natural
general 2023-06-12 13:55:20 control surface blocks make movement (especially turning) feel robotic and weird
general 2023-06-12 13:56:18 i use mouse

general 2023-06-12 14:00:08 does this not look like a cow head

general 2023-06-13 05:28:30 crazy
creations-chat 2023-06-13 08:19:43 doesnt the f-14 do that when the wings are swept back
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:07:19 they do have those flap things that i don’t know the name of that are embedded in the wings though right?
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:43:55 just finished my new space shuttle guys what do you think
general 2023-06-13 09:46:41 they should have made the stuff on the right toggleable
general 2023-06-13 09:46:47 like every other game with a ui like that

general 2023-06-13 09:50:25 eager what are your thoughts on my
general 2023-06-13 09:50:26 brand new space shuttle
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 12:45:52 because you're connecting it wrong
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 12:46:17 trapdoors cant connect to other blocks from the bottom, only from the sides
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 12:46:23 except for the side with the dot on it
general 2023-06-14 03:02:09 war thunder economy changes 🥳
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 13:20:03 and the explosion itself also lags behind the actual explosive block/ball if it’s going at any useful speed so you can’t rely on impact detonation ever
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 13:20:47 plan craz my favorite game 😍
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:04:39 it’s as simple as this

blue motor is a powered motorlock, green blocks are the blocks you want to angle
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:06:42 no, motor2 cannot be used for angle locking because it has no lock setting. you need to use a regular motor with both lock and powered settings on, then move it to the position you want to angle the blocks in.
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:08:51 people get around this by having temporary blocks to stop the angled blocks from moving past the angle they want

it’s not rocket science it’s literally just moving blocks with a motor before you collapse the motorlock tower
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:11:54 it’s extremely useful but if you’re like me and really need to get every angle on a build to be just right then it’s gonna end up looking like this pre launch
general 2023-06-16 13:48:57 AMN
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:37:06 will it have a glass canopy or you’re just gonna paint it black to cover the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:38:02 still trying to wrap my head around rickje and madattak somehow forgetting to add a cone block in their plane building game
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:40:00 can you maybe try to replace the half wedges on the nose with motorlocked half cylinders
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:42:07 like this (outdated picture (didnt even keep it))
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:35:33 turn on both lock and powered on the motors so they don’t split after you fold it, and turn on physics on any anchor blocks in the build
general 2023-06-18 07:35:53 why is flightpoint
general 2023-06-18 07:36:01 the beam does not want to resize
general 2023-06-18 07:36:25 i pull the orb thing to resize it and it goes back to the original size

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 15:21:16 especially since it is wip
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 15:21:19 and not done yet
bug-reports 2023-06-18 15:22:40 the lock setting on motors in question:
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:22:31 why would it fire the whole round
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:23:05 the propellant is contained inside the casing how would it push the casing out
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:23:27 it does the complete opposite
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:23:40 it pushes the case back in when the bullet is shot
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:23:56 bullet gets pushed forwards case gets pushed backwards
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 00:24:06 which in the case of a pistol is how the slide gets pushed back
general 2023-06-19 00:32:53 someone will send you a picture of the info channel with 700 arrows pointing at it
general 2023-06-19 00:34:09 it’s just 10 minutes of talking
general 2023-06-19 00:34:12 or less
general 2023-06-19 00:34:34 also you don’t get image perms in general
general 2023-06-19 00:34:50 you need to be an “expert”
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 01:42:29 no they just leave them there
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 01:42:54 just like they leave all the other trash they bring
creations-chat 2023-06-19 02:53:55 put two trapdoors/disconnectors side by side
creations-chat 2023-06-19 04:19:07 then just use half blocks <:shock:1098116005252841503> it’ll take like two motors at most
creations-chat 2023-06-19 04:22:27 you center it with one motor and then angle lock it with the second motor

or use pistons idfk
help 2023-06-19 05:38:07 check your ping
help 2023-06-19 05:38:50 sometimes the game has a seizure if you
a) move too many motors with blocks on them at the same time
b) explode a lot of tnt (like in motorlock towers)
help 2023-06-19 05:39:22 if that happens then your best option is to go to a private server
help 2023-06-19 05:39:29 or keep reloading the build
help 2023-06-19 05:40:47 yes that would be an issue
help 2023-06-19 05:41:09 i would try binding some of them to a second key if they’re piston locks so that you’re not moving everything at the same time
help 2023-06-19 06:37:43 honestly too short but i guess you’re not building it to scale so it’s fine
creations-chat 2023-06-19 06:41:09 did you mean to say far off then

if you say far from off then that would mean very close
general 2023-06-19 06:57:33 where are you

plane-crazy 2023-06-19 08:58:48 shredder bug users when the half piston with lock setting:
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:01:21 have you tried shooting a missile with a bugged half piston at them
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:02:17 hit them with this
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:02:34 all components of their shredder expands and noclips under the map
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:02:41 forcing them to unlaunch
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:03:38 i already know how to make 1x1 landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:03:42 you just need text
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:03:57 and a 1x2 or 1x3 space in the nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:04:08 optional horn if you want
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:04:19 then you connect everything to the motor with a text box
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:04:54 this meanwhile took me forever because i did not plan to make custom gears when i started the plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:05:12 i had to excavate and move so many blocks to get it to fit
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:05:17 
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:05:41 i do that with every plane now
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:06:01 looks like a missile and can actually be used in pvp

general 2023-06-19 09:47:13 bad wor
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:48:17 just color it you’ll be fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 09:49:28 if you want to hide the motors then you need to put the angle lock inside the fuselage and connect it to the curved part of the wing using text or cameras

general 2023-06-20 13:01:50 ol,,,
general 2023-06-20 14:43:40 ok what if i put a nuclear bomb in the reactor
general 2023-06-20 14:43:44 and turn it on
general 2023-06-20 14:44:14 😭
general 2023-06-20 14:46:07 ok what if i remove all the water for the cooling rods
general 2023-06-20 14:46:29 i go in with a pump
general 2023-06-20 14:46:34 and remove the water
general 2023-06-20 14:47:09 why are you bringing the feds into this
general 2023-06-20 14:47:32 we are trying to decommission a nuclear reactor there’s no room for realism in this conversation
general 2023-06-20 14:47:55 ok what if uhh
general 2023-06-20 14:48:58 <@766369468347580437> what if I get a ton of people to become really scared of nuclear reactors to the point where they vote against them and force the nuclear reactor to be shut down, removing the need for aazo to blow it up
general 2023-06-20 14:49:59 b-b-but the chernobeel and the uhh the japanese one!!!
general 2023-06-20 14:50:07 turn off the nucler!!

general 2023-06-20 14:50:44 <:shock:1098116005252841503>
general 2023-06-20 14:51:31 wow look at mr nuclear reactor site manager over here with his nuclear reactor knowledge
general 2023-06-20 14:52:27 whar next is he gonna tell me that current nuclear fission processes are not even capable of exploding due to their nature, and instead of melting down or exploding when the fission process gets interrupted they just fizzle out harmlessly?
general 2023-06-20 14:52:39 wow that is honestly quite incredible
general 2023-06-20 14:52:49 thank you zielony
general 2023-06-20 14:53:30 uhhh umm uhhh
general 2023-06-20 14:53:32 the uhh
general 2023-06-20 14:53:57 what if we put a turbine near the sun
general 2023-06-20 14:54:04 instead of building nuclear reactors
general 2023-06-20 14:54:14 and used the sun to boil water to move the turbine
general 2023-06-20 14:54:19 😱
general 2023-06-20 14:56:22 wow i am laughing
general 2023-06-20 14:56:43 so much
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:57:12 the wasd core in question:
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:57:27 https://tenor.com/view/transitions-kinemaster-black-guy-suit-tiktok-gif-25279479
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:58:04 your solution sucks just make this and make them leave the server
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:59:31 the next lesson is how to make a anti shredder missile as shown in the picture
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:59:47 which i will not be giving
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:03:20 yes but it’s not practical because:
- cutters become fard at high speeds which means you need to slow down to do it
- because of that the shredder can just kill you
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:03:35 just shoot the anti shredder missile at it
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:03:37 not that hard
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:03:42 and it’s funny
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:07:35 ok but they stop becoming a problem with the anti shredder missile
general 2023-06-20 16:47:51 rickje taking my 399 robux and converting it through devex to use for genshin impact spendings
general 2023-06-20 16:48:42 https://tenor.com/view/dr-manhattan-gif-18899941
general 2023-06-20 16:48:46 die
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:50:08 so called “advanced shredders” when i hit them with the
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:50:43 🙂
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:51:07 it is my anti shredder missile
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:51:10 patent pending
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:51:29 even better
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:51:40 when you hit something that has motors on it
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:51:52 everything connected to the motors expands away from the center of the build
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:52:05 usually resulting in the entire build expanding and noclipping into the floor
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:52:13 so,
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:52:17 when you hit a shredder
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:52:28 which relies on motors to spin the cutters
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:52:36 it blows up violently
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:53:18 honestly you could probably just use the stuff on it and put it on a shredder template and it would work better
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:53:33 but i like the idea of it being a missile
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:53:45 also it flings regular builds too
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:54:26 launch from the sea for the best results
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:54:38 (can’t get blacklisted by the shredder if they don’t know who you are)
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:55:14 it would probably be very glitchy
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:55:23 probably
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:55:27 never bothered to try
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:55:48 mouse guided missiles are super hard to use anyway
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:55:57 might as well just become the missile
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 16:56:25 try it
general 2023-06-21 06:29:24 it is exactly the same as main pilot seat
general 2023-06-21 06:29:28 except you don’t spawn in it
general 2023-06-21 06:29:46 duh
general 2023-06-21 06:29:52 pc doesnt have coop
general 2023-06-21 06:30:00 no
general 2023-06-21 07:45:25 40+ degrees with humidity in the philippines:
plane-crazy 2023-06-22 16:31:36 it’s true
plane-crazy 2023-06-22 16:31:39 i killed him
plane-crazy 2023-06-22 16:31:44 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-06-22 19:21:49 ok more air kills now 👍
general 2023-06-22 19:22:33 grahhhh both assists were me firing the last shot but it didnt give me full credit
general 2023-06-22 19:23:06 does it matter how they died
general 2023-06-22 19:23:14 they are dead
general 2023-06-22 19:23:16 end of story
general 2023-06-22 19:23:54 i wonder what the conversation between the passengers and the ceo was like
general 2023-06-22 19:56:52 honestly quite incredible
general 2023-06-22 19:57:08 https://tenor.com/view/honestly-quite-incredible-drinking-water-underwater-cool-gif-22285702
general 2023-06-22 20:01:49 why can’t you just flood an infected area with neurotoxins and be done with it
general 2023-06-22 20:02:07 they’re still human bodies
general 2023-06-22 20:02:36 or if they’re walking dead zombies literally just get like
general 2023-06-22 20:02:38 10 guys
general 2023-06-22 20:02:43 in a few towers
general 2023-06-22 20:03:00 how did the walking dead even happen
general 2023-06-22 20:03:04 they’re so fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:03:27 now if it’s like the last of us then maybe
general 2023-06-22 20:03:29 because
general 2023-06-22 20:03:35 it spread through food at the start
general 2023-06-22 20:03:46 no but
general 2023-06-22 20:03:52 why did the military response fail
general 2023-06-22 20:04:07 twd zombies are so incredibly fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:04:22 at least in tlou right
general 2023-06-22 20:04:28 they’re really really aggressive
general 2023-06-22 20:04:45 and a ton of people got infected at the same time through food
general 2023-06-22 20:04:49 so it makes sense
general 2023-06-22 20:04:57 but in twd they just walk
general 2023-06-22 20:05:02 and only turn when they die
general 2023-06-22 20:05:36 zombie apocalypse fans when i introduce the military industrial complex to them
general 2023-06-22 20:05:49 they’re still so fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:06:06 i have to say fucking every time because they’re just that slow
general 2023-06-22 20:06:11 they’re so fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:06:14 and stupid
general 2023-06-22 20:06:37 you can’t defend twd zombies bruh
general 2023-06-22 20:07:32 why do they spray and pray into the zombies even when they’re in secure positions
general 2023-06-22 20:07:38 just take precise shots
general 2023-06-22 20:07:40 one by one
general 2023-06-22 20:07:43 they’re so fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:07:50 you can just aim for the head on each of them
general 2023-06-22 20:08:01 and if you have friends then all the zombies die
general 2023-06-22 20:08:10 or you run out of bullets
general 2023-06-22 20:08:18 literally though
general 2023-06-22 20:08:22 they’re so fucking slow
general 2023-06-22 20:08:29 i am talking about like the military
general 2023-06-22 20:08:34 why is the military always stupid
general 2023-06-22 20:08:57 they have like a million dudes just send a couple out and they’ll kill everything
general 2023-06-22 20:09:10 you don’t even need them on the floor you can just send a plane in
general 2023-06-22 20:09:24 a plane
general 2023-06-22 20:09:30 or planes plural
general 2023-06-22 20:09:36 literally just anything in the air
general 2023-06-22 20:09:56 you don’t even need to risk soldiers just send a fucking plane in
general 2023-06-22 20:10:06 fragmentation rocket pods
general 2023-06-22 20:10:09 napalm
general 2023-06-22 20:10:41 even the philippines could handle a zombie invasion if it was twd zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:10:45 or just in general
general 2023-06-22 20:10:52 just send a super tucano in
general 2023-06-22 20:11:12 if they are fast the planes are still faster
general 2023-06-22 20:11:28 the only way for a zombie apocalypse to work is if it spreads that fast
general 2023-06-22 20:11:32 like in the last of us
general 2023-06-22 20:11:53 why would you waste 30mm on zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:12:10 then just use another plane
general 2023-06-22 20:12:14 why the a-10
general 2023-06-22 20:12:26 you don’t need the a-10 to send napalm onto zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:12:29 or really anything
general 2023-06-22 20:13:00 because there are a gazillion other planes that can do its job better
general 2023-06-22 20:13:37 why would it be the a-10 being sent out though
general 2023-06-22 20:14:08 just send in literally anything else
general 2023-06-22 20:14:29 you don’t need to
general 2023-06-22 20:14:48 if it’s zombies you wouldnt even need a jet
general 2023-06-22 20:14:53 SHUT U
general 2023-06-22 20:15:25 yeah and the pilots are gonna be visually identifying zombies because the a-10 sucks
general 2023-06-22 20:15:31 they’re gonna have to fuckin
general 2023-06-22 20:15:34 look out the canopy
general 2023-06-22 20:15:46 and don’t tell me “oh but but the a-10c”
general 2023-06-22 20:15:55 that thing is more expensive than the f-35
general 2023-06-22 20:16:20 actually you know what
general 2023-06-22 20:16:24 you don’t even need a plane
general 2023-06-22 20:16:31 a helicopter would be better
general 2023-06-22 20:16:34 or a drone
general 2023-06-22 20:16:51 just anything that can fly in and kill everything
general 2023-06-22 20:17:22 https://tenor.com/view/angy-bladerunner-blade-runner-2049-gif-16913771
general 2023-06-22 20:17:34 SHUT UP ABOUT THE A-10
general 2023-06-22 20:17:39 🔥🔥🔥
general 2023-06-22 20:19:33 a-10 fans when i show them the f-111
general 2023-06-22 20:20:11 “big gun go brrrrrt” people when i remind them that almost all of the a-10s kills were with missiles or bombs
general 2023-06-22 20:20:35 “oh but see the a-10 can be used as a missile tru-“ YOU DONT NEED THE A-10 FOR THAT
general 2023-06-22 20:21:06 all of them except one
general 2023-06-22 20:21:15 just put it in a museum
general 2023-06-22 20:22:02 I’m not even talking about zombies anymor blud I’m just crapping on the a-10
general 2023-06-22 20:22:18 because it’s mid
general 2023-06-22 20:22:23 it’s cool but it’s mid
general 2023-06-22 20:23:02 built around a gun, but it can’t use the gun on anything so you put missiles and bombs on it, which you can accomplish with literally any other plane
general 2023-06-22 20:23:07 so why have the gun at all
general 2023-06-22 20:23:43 and then the upgrade package that makes it useable by the pilot (orange panels <:empty:794431705070174238> ) is more expensive than the fucking f-35 somehow
general 2023-06-22 20:25:10 how about a prop plane or a helicopter then if that’s what you need
general 2023-06-22 20:25:29 you only use the a-10 during total air dominance anyway
general 2023-06-22 20:25:36 so the other two become useable as well
general 2023-06-22 20:26:56 and is very expensive
general 2023-06-22 20:27:01 again
general 2023-06-22 20:27:03 f-35
general 2023-06-22 20:27:09 costs less
general 2023-06-22 20:28:02 what’s your rebuttal for helicopters then
general 2023-06-22 20:28:08 the ultimate loiter time
general 2023-06-22 20:31:03 yeah i have an old nokia it still works so i should use it
general 2023-06-22 20:31:25 and,
general 2023-06-22 20:31:33 does loiter time even matter?
general 2023-06-22 20:32:10 the f-35 can carry more ordinance in beast mode (again it’s also less expensive than the a-10c) so couldnt you just order a strike and have it zoom in
general 2023-06-22 20:32:16 send what it needs to send
general 2023-06-22 20:32:21 we are in 2023
general 2023-06-22 20:32:32 vietnam tactics do not apply anymore
general 2023-06-22 20:32:47 which is why you have more than one
general 2023-06-22 20:32:49 right
general 2023-06-22 20:33:03 even the a-10 is sent in pairs
general 2023-06-22 20:33:56 and also
general 2023-06-22 20:33:59 so is the a-10
general 2023-06-22 20:34:18 i don’t care about the fucking bathtub the rest of the plane is ripe for being shot at
general 2023-06-22 20:35:09 help me out here tail and suri
general 2023-06-22 20:35:28 the p-51 is faster innit
general 2023-06-22 20:35:34 ol
general 2023-06-22 20:35:48 the a-10 is slow
general 2023-06-22 20:36:02 super tucano
general 2023-06-22 20:37:13 if you need to saturate the place then why send the slow ass a-10 in instead of just getting a faster jet to drop everything in
general 2023-06-22 20:37:16 ahem
general 2023-06-22 20:37:20 like the f-35
general 2023-06-22 20:37:35 not talking about zombies anymor
general 2023-06-22 20:37:47 proven in wars from last century
general 2023-06-22 20:37:59 stop applying vietnam and ww2 to the 21st century
general 2023-06-22 20:38:55 the f-111:
general 2023-06-22 20:39:13 the f-111 was more effective than the a-10
general 2023-06-22 20:39:19 despite having less sorties
general 2023-06-22 20:39:43 and yet for some reason the aardvark got retired first like what the hell man
general 2023-06-22 20:40:00 we are just talking about the planes irl now
general 2023-06-22 20:40:03 forget the zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:40:43 ok fine then back to zombies if that’s what you want
general 2023-06-22 20:40:50 why use the a-10 for zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:40:53 super tucano
general 2023-06-22 20:40:59 helicopter
general 2023-06-22 20:41:38 that’s not even the point i was making
general 2023-06-22 20:41:48 i started suggesting slower things than the a-10
general 2023-06-22 20:42:47 why…??? you could use fragmentation rockets or napalm or neurotoxins
general 2023-06-22 20:42:54 why use the gun
general 2023-06-22 20:43:20 https://tenor.com/view/low-tier-god-gif-25175746
general 2023-06-22 20:43:36 what’s your point
general 2023-06-22 20:43:41 it’s zombies
general 2023-06-22 20:44:42 also
general 2023-06-22 20:44:44 you keep
general 2023-06-22 20:44:50 talking about loiter time
general 2023-06-22 20:45:01 how about the time it takes for the hog to even get there in the first place
general 2023-06-22 20:45:16 you could send an f-15ex or an f-16 and it would be over even faster
general 2023-06-22 20:45:23 zombies or not
general 2023-06-22 20:45:34 who cares about loiter time at that point
general 2023-06-22 20:46:40 ok to clarify first are we talking about real life right now or the zombies or both
general 2023-06-22 20:46:57 if it’s zombies then who cares about fuel bruh they drop everything and then go back
general 2023-06-22 20:47:06 same with not zombies honestly
general 2023-06-22 20:47:11 slow
general 2023-06-22 20:47:13 gets shot down
general 2023-06-22 20:47:16 noob
general 2023-06-22 20:47:37 why the fuck would it run out of fuel???
general 2023-06-22 20:47:45 did they take the 3 minute fuel option or something
general 2023-06-22 20:49:07 why am i even arguing with a-10 defenders at 4 am
general 2023-06-22 20:49:19 not you smh
general 2023-06-22 20:49:24 the other guy
general 2023-06-22 20:49:26 mildis
general 2023-06-22 20:50:24 the 40 foot splash radius in question:

help 2023-07-03 15:10:19 nose looks too long
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:13:00 build this
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:16:22 if you can hit the shredders with it directly yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:17:35 the regular effect is that it just flings other people/their builds in a random direction
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:17:57 with random distances
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:18:05 you can send people to the void if you’re lucky
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:18:07 but
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:18:17 if the build has anything connected with motors or motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:18:24 then it also makes the build explode
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:18:51 but not like a regular explosion it makes the entire thing expand and slowly come back together
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:19:12 so obviously, since shredders are practically built out of things spinning on motors
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:19:38 if they get hit by this they will instantly expand and become unusable for at least a few seconds
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:19:53 either that or get flung away
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:19:55 or both
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:20:29 so just build this missile, pilot it with a camera, hide your character somewhere and you can harass shredders as much as you want
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:22:58 i havent had that happen to me yet
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 09:23:52 the only problem i have with this missile is that if it gets damaged at all i have to instantly unlaunch or the game will freeze
help 2023-07-04 12:41:21 just spam a ton of blocks in the corner of your plot so it moves
plane-crazy 2023-07-04 12:44:27 you mean a truss right

general 2023-07-05 22:55:20 donald trump
general 2023-07-05 22:55:52 it’s the accidental eye
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:57:18 what no you gotta explode it in front of the target
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:32 or just be annoying and repurpose the anti-shredder missile for flinging people
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:52 (do not do this you will get blacklisted and everyone will hate you)
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:59:48 have a friend fly the anti-shredder missile into someone to bug out their build and then send in your regular missile to blow it up while it’s expanded
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:00:13 use it on shredders
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:00:30 and make sure the front has a ton of piston heads motorlocked together
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:00:41 yeah you need to react fast if you get hit

general 2023-07-05 23:32:17 rickje139 when his community asks him to talk about the game and when he basically does an interview with an entire group asking him questions some guy just nags him until he leaves:
general 2023-07-05 23:32:30 https://tenor.com/view/nothing-food-fridge-sad-gif-16804654
general 2023-07-05 23:34:39 does rickje even know it exists
general 2023-07-05 23:34:42 he never said
general 2023-07-05 23:35:38 is this like a yanderedev situation
general 2023-07-05 23:36:47 https://tenor.com/view/aneurysm-hhhhomeboyyyy-kings-dark-tidings-saga-by-kel-kade-reaperleviathan-head-explode-gif-21578105
general 2023-07-06 00:42:30 personal mute from rickje139 how could you take away such a gift
general 2023-07-06 00:44:13 you missed it completely
general 2023-07-06 00:44:29 like 20 of us pestered rickje with questions
general 2023-07-06 00:44:41 this is the most informative message
general 2023-07-06 00:44:54 it is in fact done but it keeps breaking so he keeps having to fix it
general 2023-07-06 00:46:05 and then okboomer7161 throughout the entire conversation kept saying stuff like “just quit” and “have you tried quitting?” and “are you too cheap to hire developers? is it because of your nationality?”
general 2023-07-06 00:46:08 verbatim
general 2023-07-06 00:46:29 so rickje then left and went to the contest winner channel or something idk it said no access
general 2023-07-06 00:46:59 he also personally muted 3 people who were making fun of him while he explained his situation
general 2023-07-06 00:47:40 anyway main takeaway: it’s done but it is repeatedly breaking so it’s not done
general 2023-07-06 00:48:10 it was like we were in a room with him and whenever someone ticked him off he just shot them
general 2023-07-06 00:48:47 then he just got tired and left
general 2023-07-06 00:51:40 he’s already gone mayn no more
general 2023-07-06 00:53:17 i can’t tell if rick has reached his breaking point or he got extremely motivated and is done listening to bs
general 2023-07-06 00:55:08 xamn
general 2023-07-06 00:55:39 rickje comes back and goes on a rampage then eskeline gets muted
general 2023-07-06 00:55:49 incredible start to the day

general 2023-07-06 01:08:32 do you want the truth
general 2023-07-06 01:09:22 this is the main takeaway
general 2023-07-06 01:10:44 he came in and told us his situation
general 2023-07-06 01:11:29 <@756778370376925255> basically; he is done for the most part but roblox studio keeps breaking and making him have to fix something he already finished

plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:41:14 if he wants to do the summer update he has to manually copy-paste each asset of the update by hand, which will obviously take forever so he wont be doing it
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:44:28 this is why he kept talking about spaghetti code making it impossible to update the game
