general 2022-06-06 14:10:30 The ranks are checklists if you can’t get a rank your not building good things
general 2022-06-06 14:10:46 Yeah
general 2022-06-06 14:11:04 Only reason I have yet to get a rank is lack of chat level lol
general 2022-06-06 14:12:08 Maybe read how to get a rank and you will understand
general 2022-06-06 14:12:24 Then stop complaining

general 2022-06-06 14:23:31 Tutorial on how to die: hey guys I just invented a new kind of shredder
general 2022-06-06 14:24:10 That’s the point
general 2022-06-06 14:24:14 I have no soul
general 2022-06-06 14:24:25 Honesty I’m just spouting random stuff to gain levels
general 2022-06-06 14:25:23 I once noticed someone was copying me so I made a few modifications that made the plane not work
general 2022-06-06 14:26:01 Lol
bot-central 2022-06-06 14:26:24 !rank
general 2022-06-06 14:27:32 The day I found out you can place 2k suspension with helium to make a tall rope is the first time I’ve had fun in a while
general 2022-06-06 14:27:49 Also the first time my cpu reached 90 degrees
general 2022-06-06 14:29:10 I have a genuine question who is developing all these shredders my defenses keep getting outdated
general 2022-06-06 14:30:00 Lol
general 2022-06-06 14:32:05 I have 1 last question. what the glitchiest item in the game
general 2022-06-06 14:33:40 Can it be weaponized to create anti everything missiles they patched my old ones
general 2022-06-06 14:35:05 That’s a shame rip my giant gun you will be missed
general 2022-06-06 14:36:30 I was fuming yesterday cause I logged on checked out my builds for half of my glitches to be gone and my builds to stop working
general 2022-06-06 14:38:11 They patched my forcefield I had to cry myself to sleep

bot-central 2022-06-06 14:51:37 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 14:53:36 Is this even worth trying for a rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 14:53:38 The reason it has so much is cuz it has a interior and is fully armored with layers of single blocks to incovinece gun users
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 14:55:00 By requirements it qualify for 4 unless upvotes then it would qualify for 5
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 14:58:26 It’s like 20 or 30 FPS
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:11:56 Yes fully however I’m not at home for video rn
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:24:22 It’s not that bad in actual game also it’s not based of anything  bruh <@738091123590824000> what part looks the worst I’ll change some of it if it’s reall that bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:33:40 Bro I don’t understand why people can’t just suggest issues with builds and not rant issues and immediately say creations blacklist :/
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:38:32 <@636996526878490624> can you dm me a picture of a steampunk city idk what it is
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:41:55 What’s a copy script by the way
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:42:20 That exists?
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:43:11 What if the other person says you can copy is it just game locked ban or theft ban
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:44:17 I was wondering cuz my friend wanted me to build a jet for him if it’s not aloud I’ll just design with him
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:45:36 Bro tbh I made this thing cuz I hate folding I might just stick with being a designer for my friends weapons lol
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:47:54 Alright but I’ll have to do research I usually try to make things unique and purposeful tbh that tank held me back cuz it was a fun little experiment to modernize one of my first  buildss
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 15:59:08 What does it defect
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:00:40 The only thing in good at is designing weapons and gadgets for actual people with skill
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:02:38 Important do you have a speaker with the brrrrrt
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:02:54 Respect threw the roof
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:04:07 I spent 2 hours on a icbm that doesn’t work cuz to many balls cause aim to waver
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:05:17 I made the strongest weapon it crashes who ever it hits but there’s no way you can hit it it takes 60 seconds and it’s helium powered
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:06:13 What’s it’s top speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:07:25 My best controllable jet is named scrap metal but it can teleport I don’t know what I did but all other jets that fight me just give up cuz of how glitchy my jet is
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:08:47 Bro the worst thing I’ve done is I accidentally deleted my second plane which turned out decent it looked bad but it carried all 300 tnts
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:08:58 Make bow sharper
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:09:50 I’m following my friends example and doing a big ship tutorial for a base ship bow I can use lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:10:53 I had to delete a building that I named lag factory due to being told by multipul people to delete it or mass report
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:11:28 Epic
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:12:30 Yes and no defence system it lagged so badly that I could deploy beacons s that stopped middle fire and shot down planes due to there speed being slowed
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:13:15 In short it was too broken and had to be removed last I check they fixed it tho so even if I rebuild it wouldn’t work no more
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:14:22 50% of my op glitches are gone and all of my WMDS are patched
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:14:38 Trial and error
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:15:01 *tactical lag machines
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:16:14 I might publicly post my bomb designs when I start up my lab again
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:16:40 Bro I made some crazy bombs in 2020
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:18:16 I made a picture perfect osprey but it would’ve t fly with just propellers so I scrapped it
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:18:45 They need to add cylinder tnt
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:20:48 Bro I spent 6 hours reaserching air to air systems just for a maximum range of 2000ish studs for a max armament of my planes of 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:21:27 I’ve had to scrap so many huge planes due to incompatibility with my weapons
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:05:58 What is a inventor role
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:14:22 I’m think about making a new missle design for a ship what would be better focus speed, damage, aoe
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:19:15 That’s not a issue for me I mean like what is good purpose for a new weapon I’m developing
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:19:33 Ight
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:21:19 Orbital or Sub orbital (sideways launch) or vertical
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:28:30 You think I can put missles on it for a twin impact or would it bug out and blow itself up
general 2022-06-06 18:39:14 I have 2 pings in probably a admin chat idk I can’t view them
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 20:18:40 i plan on making this capapult launch is it to sharp or should i leave it as
help 2022-06-06 20:20:26 should i even out with 1x2 or double it needs the bottom slant to launch of my platform
