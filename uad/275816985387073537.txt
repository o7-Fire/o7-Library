bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:04:45 I've tried rejoining ^
bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:13:46 I have the flaps set to mouse controls, however, any way I move the mouse, they **don't** follow. They just 'spaz out.'
bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:14:10 Or they don't move at all, which is especially evident in those top tail flaps.
bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:19:28 It hasn't always been broken like this.
bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:20:53 And the only plane it's affecting is the one I took a video of, all of the other flaps on my planes work fine; except for those, which don't move at all when I move the mouse even though they should.
bug-reports 2019-09-02 16:34:58 Idk. I'll figure it out.
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:07:22 Ik ik, I call them flaps. That's the issue, I was using mouse controls and they weren't moving at all.
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:07:34 But, they're fine now, it was just the build it looks like. Ty.
