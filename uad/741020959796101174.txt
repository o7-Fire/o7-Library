help 2022-12-27 20:07:37 Is this a good length for a jet? Or does it need to be longer?
creations-chat 2022-12-27 20:09:21 can someone help me out in <#478584971670454284> ?
creations-chat 2022-12-27 20:13:30 maybe not. A friend helped me make my first jet and only 2 months after did I watch one of their videos and go "hm... kinda seems like the exact same advice my old friend gave me..." lol
creations-chat 2022-12-27 20:16:22 Is my jet long enough or does the back need to be longer? ( <#478584971670454284> )
help 2022-12-27 20:26:49 It's an original jet. But my plan is to have dual-Verts and not canards.

creations-chat 2022-12-30 13:44:26 Make the intakes bigger and change the canopy ‚úÖÔ∏è

Thank you
creations-chat 2022-12-31 01:45:23 Could you please elaborate on "angular and bigger?" I would really appreciate it
creations-chat 2022-12-31 01:56:57 Thank you very much. I'm new to motor locking and I really want to get better lol
creations-chat 2022-12-31 02:03:53 <@718416920474288149> How would you recommend rotating/adding depth to the intakes? Wing panels like above? Or making it an actual hole? Or some other tactic perhaps?
creations-chat 2022-12-31 02:10:51 Just *one* more question; how would you recommend making the cockpit (based on F22/F35) if it is a two seater? Just make it longer?
creations-chat 2022-12-31 02:20:31 Do you mean like shorten the nose along with the canopy and keep the back seat as the main seat?

creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:16:26 Is there anything that I can do to improve my **Dark Crow** Ultralight?

help 2023-01-12 02:05:37 why is the bot telling me not to spam?? It would be the first time posting the build if it would let me post it. never posted it

creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:50:35 *Most* of the people here have some kind of vendetta against fighter jets. Probably because the are made ***so often***. Personally I really love a *good* fighter jet.

Edit: but I can understand why some of the people here's standards are very high
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:53:50 Your fighter jet did not impress me. Thus I did not up vote it. This does not say otherwise... in fact this is exact proof of my point. My standards are probably much lower than other "critics" here. But that does not mean that they do not exist

Edit: if you want to make it better, make the wings less blocky (you can camera lock, or angle lock... whatever is easiest), and make the front part thicker
creations-chat 2023-01-14 06:56:43 Fair point üëç

But with some of the standards of ***some*** (Notice that I am not even close to saying ***all***) people in this server, they definitely act like critics lol
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:02:08 Been playing since that same time, and mine do not lol üíÄ
help 2023-01-14 07:03:14 Do I need to close, and create another ticket to get a higher rank, or can I use the same ticket that I used for my previous ranks?
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:06:58 Quick question. 

In this image, the motor lock branches off into multiple directions. How do I do that? I know how to turn it and such but how do I split it like into 6 parts?
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:12:00 This is specifically what I said I already know how to do lol. I'm asking how it would split into to different directions from the same spot
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:20:02 Thank you. Is it possible to do this vertically?

Edit:<@410455661814480896>  how exactly would you do this since the motors would have to be rotated (for vertical lock)
creations-chat 2023-01-14 20:01:11 WIP destroyer
help 2023-01-15 23:15:57 are the mods supposed to close my ticket after I get the rank?
