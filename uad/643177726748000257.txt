general 2021-12-24 01:05:21 I found a glitch that rearranges your bodyparts
general 2021-12-24 01:05:39 oh ok
general 2021-12-24 01:06:52 Sometimes It makes it look like you are going at inf speed while in the air, but you can still see textbubbles and hear things as if you were on your building area, and no one can see you while this is going on
general 2021-12-24 01:07:08 :)
general 2021-12-24 01:07:18 It can basically do anything
