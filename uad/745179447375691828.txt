general 2021-11-16 10:55:53 are hover drives allowed in aeronautical engineer role?
general 2021-11-16 10:58:49 pog
general 2021-11-16 10:59:23 welp
general 2021-11-16 10:59:33 i wanna join just to watch the chaos
general 2021-11-16 11:00:27 RIP
general 2021-11-16 11:00:40 somebody pin this
general 2021-11-16 11:00:44 i wish tho
general 2021-11-16 11:02:35 do u think they will allow hover drives for aeronautics
general 2021-11-16 11:02:49 oh mk
general 2021-11-16 11:03:02 i didnt kno if it was liek it was facing down or not
general 2021-11-16 11:03:21 well my a10 is gonna be thruster powered now
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:42:21 so wat happen if we join the private server
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:43:08 eh I was wondering if it was like largely different to normal pc
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:43:45 oh ik that already
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:44:15 I just thought it would be like a new block or smth lol
general 2021-12-15 08:45:27 how good is a firework for interceptor aircraft
general 2021-12-15 08:46:13 is it useful for aircraft?
general 2021-12-15 08:47:05 I think I should put it on my aircraft but it‚Äôs gonna be impractical so idk
general 2021-12-15 08:47:23 how does it compare to rockets in terms of damage?
general 2021-12-15 08:48:05 .
general 2021-12-15 08:48:39 mk
general 2021-12-15 08:48:55 I think I should put it on my a10 tho
general 2021-12-15 08:49:06 bc it‚Äôs still more firepower
general 2021-12-15 08:49:22 I do heavy motor locking on all my vehicles
general 2021-12-15 08:51:11 I never worry abt space bc I literally build everything off of a giant motor lock tower

creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:11:04 can you give me an example of an rgb?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:17:18 mk
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:22:24 this a better color?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:33:28 alright i'll try
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:50:34 i cant get the back vert stabilizers to be flush w/o ruining the folding ability
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:55:18 i cant really fix this problem without sacrificing the shape of the plane, unlike giant bombers
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:00:31 So i fixed the outer blocky wing problem to an extent
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:10:20 should i use this wing type? or this type
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:12:51 i feel that might require me to restart so the question is
is it worth restarting
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:17:36 the problem comes from practicality, plane crazy doesnt have angles like 1.2 x1 eg and to make it yourself means sacrificing alot of function just for looks, i like making my jets atleast recogniseable to the real plane but also still be good at pvp at the same time
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:21:09 this is an example of a TU-4 that i built a while back and its primary flaw is that i used angle locking but it still ended up looking quirky (PM) forgot to add image (PPM) game crashed bc went too fast with it
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:23:25 you could technically use the b29 as reference for the chaos that i did
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:25:56 Fair enough, just one issue for me
i only build pvp builds
Welp
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:28:00 obs studio?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:34:48 bc its not entirely style, thats just the pc community, they dont like pvp as much as style
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:36:50 u said it to me yourself
(PM) should i annoy the <#384025409945337856> channel by posting a ptfs plane?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:40:47 oh alright then
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:44:50 my potato sucks but it can run this
the-dump 2021-12-27 02:53:43 
the-dump 2021-12-29 00:54:35 
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:57:07 Another issue is ppl find builds personal and relate it to what they build eg, if somebody is building an f16 and they see a good looking f16 they would probably downvote it out of spite or bc they think theirs is better
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:01:04 The thing is some people will respect that and incorporate things into future builds, (like you just said) but there is always going to be that one person out there that will downvote it simply for the sake of doing so
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:04:44 Same, it‚Äôs kinda sad that people favor builds sometimes not because of detail or the effort put into it, but because of what it is supposed to resemble
creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:50:59 I critique my own builds compared to other builds eg and set my standards using good builds as the lower limit to try and improve my building

general 2022-03-12 02:53:09 * cri *
general 2022-03-12 02:53:31 making all sounds that aren‚Äôt owned by developer silent
general 2022-03-12 02:53:42 for example games like ptfs and plane crazy should be safe
general 2022-03-12 02:53:50 but games like piggy will be mute
general 2022-03-12 02:55:09 I think they should‚Äôve introduced smth like the YouTube algorithm where it copyright strikes the things that the bot thinks is a copyrighted audio
general 2022-03-12 02:55:30 idk that much abt the system but I think it might‚Äôve been feasible
general 2022-03-12 02:55:37 yea
general 2022-03-12 02:56:21 Well I have one idea?
general 2022-03-12 02:56:27 idk if it‚Äôs gonna work
general 2022-03-12 02:56:37 but u can try uploading it on ur acc
general 2022-03-12 02:57:05 Like make the audio and upload it urself, might work idk
general 2022-03-12 02:57:17 oh alr
general 2022-03-12 02:58:18 for example with ptfs it‚Äôs owned by orange 12345 and he owns all the audios so it shouldn‚Äôt be affected at all
general 2022-03-12 02:58:30 under his user
general 2022-03-12 02:58:54 pretty sure it was 1.7mil their top
general 2022-03-12 03:01:33 I made a joke on a vid abt roblox making all games private to prevent inappropriate content
general 2022-03-12 03:02:18 rippp
general 2022-03-12 03:02:33 There is this old game I play a bit every now and then
general 2022-03-12 03:02:40 rip robeats

general 2022-05-18 09:34:55 pl√¶n crzya
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:49:47 should I build a yf23 with an actually accurate square pyramid to hex nose?
and also if so if u can, can someone suggest a way for me to make a 0.5 wide 1 tall and 2 long triangle wedge?
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:54:04 bad drawing on wat I mean (first is side view second is front view and last one is top view
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:56:32 I have tried 1x4 wedges but they don‚Äôt work very well and they overrun the nose , they look kinda like this
(Responding to comment below) A bad drawing that‚Äôs supposed to be a triangle wedge
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:58:58 a bad drawing that‚Äôs supposed to be a triangle wedge (blueprint format)
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:01:02 do u atleast understand this?
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:04:36 Currently in plane crazy the only 0.5 block triangle wedge is a 1x1x0.5 and the only 2 block triangle wedge is a 2x1x1 when I need a 2x0.5x1
And I don‚Äôt wanna wait until the rewrite to finish my yf23 nose
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:08:27 The light gray bit is the part that I need it for
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:11:24 Yes but I am very worried about the top being visible through the bottom plus I can‚Äôt just use 1x4 bc it‚Äôs 2 block long
creations-chat 2022-06-14 05:19:00 I think they mean like activated on launch, you can‚Äôt do that but you can use piston lock and toggle to motor lock it into the place when you spawn
general 2022-07-01 07:48:20 Do u think pc2 is still scheduled for  summer?
general 2022-07-01 12:59:01 real (really real)
general 2022-07-01 13:08:11 no scale tool? :megamind:
general 2022-07-01 13:09:04 why u not playing pc2 ||joke||
general 2022-07-01 13:12:49 k now we need pc3
general 2022-07-01 13:13:04 pc2 was cool while it was
general 2022-07-01 13:13:12 we need pc4 too
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:13:41 What does weld do on a magnet
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:17:09 ‚ÄúWeld: unknown‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:22:40 what even is the purpose of magnet lock other than just hiding motor lock
(since it would theoretically be easier just to hide it in a place where it won‚Äôt be seen)
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:27:19 I was gonna make my yf23 nose a similar concept to accomodate for the lack of the correct angle but then decided to change it for practicality plus it would have a bunch of gaps at the lvl I was gonna have to do it at
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:30:28 <#925563336500871268> read wat it says
general 2022-08-01 07:35:36 Summer ends in 30 days
general 2022-08-01 07:36:11 That means that if we are lucky, <#529858892075761694>
general 2022-08-01 12:53:33 Should I just post a plane for a rank
general 2022-08-01 12:53:51 But again idk I feel like pcc will give me pcc treatment if so
general 2022-08-02 05:38:13 How many blocks can a piston push without becoming a detriment towards extending speed?
general 2022-08-02 05:39:31 I‚Äôm building a catapult using pistons bc they should be the most reliable and least game breaking method there is, testing showed with simple stacking that it launched a modded in game plane crazy tutorial plane at 180 sps
general 2022-08-02 05:40:38 U sure? I can‚Äôt think of an efficient way to rearm the catapult without roblox physics getting in the way
general 2022-08-02 05:40:56 I put long landing gear on it and 2 rear landing gear
general 2022-08-02 05:44:48 I don‚Äôt really think this would be a very efficient solution to a catapult simply because roblox physics means that these springs can be unpredictable and I feel like with the wifi I have it might just make the game have a seizure https://youtu.be/152Lpwd11js
general 2022-08-02 05:48:41 It‚Äôs the parusu catapult tut btw, first example I could find
general 2022-08-03 06:55:36 Will the aerodynamics be optional?
general 2022-08-03 07:08:54 If we are lucky, it might be this month (because of the this summer thing and that it‚Äôs the last month of summer) but as rickje said that there is a lot happening behind the scenes that we don‚Äôt know about, it is not a guarantee that pc2 will come out this month. It‚Äôs better to wait for a good polished update instead of instantly get an unpolished one in my opinion
general 2022-08-03 07:10:28 That was in 2020-
general 2022-08-03 07:14:54 It might be possible that‚Äôs it‚Äôs because he keeps adding to what he plans to add in the update but issues with roblox not being the most sophisticated game engine out there, I am a very amateur programmer and I personally encounter a lot of optimisation issues with my projects and finding workarounds can be challenging, with this much coming in the update I can only imagine all the optimisations that must happen to make the game run smoothly
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 12:15:15 Someone make a 2022 of this gif

plane-crazy 2022-08-03 12:16:49 dam
creations-chat 2022-08-11 06:26:03 is it a bad sign when ur plane isn‚Äôt even half done and ur already starting to run out of plot space

bc it‚Äôs happening to me
creations-chat 2022-08-11 06:28:16 ok, btw the amt of piston locking it has so far and the amount it will have is also probs way too much for the game to handle, ends 20 realities while tryna spawn it rn bc of roblox physics
creations-chat 2022-08-11 08:05:28 alr
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 06:17:21 Should I try to make a bp accurate b1? Just got the measurements to one however it will be a lot bigger than realistic roscale, being 10 or 20 blocks longer and wider than real roscale (real roscale can be calculated several ways but the most reliable way of getting accurate size is irl meters/0.7 and for gods sake n o t. 1. b l o c k. t h i c k.
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 06:18:38 Another way of getting roscale btw is just converting meter to a block if you are building large stuff that is grid reliant for accuracy
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 06:19:05 It‚Äôs a lot less complicated but can cause grid issues
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 06:27:39 Btw if u don‚Äôt believe me abt the not 1 block thick look at this thing

creations-chat 2023-03-05 07:05:01 I built an AAM
However I used some shredder bug principles to make it work, which makes it funny that it‚Äôs main target will most likely be shredder bugs
In defence, shredder bugs were originally guided missiles tho which got given cutters instead of warheads which separates the missile from a pure shredder bug
