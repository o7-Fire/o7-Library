creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:24:13 its a build made for speed and speed only
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:26:02 it has a conveyer engine and lots of super rockets and is about 30 degrees in the upwards direction
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:32:32 dude im being downvoted on my anoying pvp plane
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:34:38 for me its creations and not just looks
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:39:13 meh if i get upvotes i might decide that its a good build
general 2020-11-25 14:40:20 no
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:41:41 yeah i was wondering if i could just scale up this to like a cargo boat that is heavily fortified or something lol
guess the ppl of plane crazy only care for looks
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:43:26 true ive tried to pvp on water its just not so good on the other hand my air vehicles are good in pvp
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:44:58 sounds like a plan to drain a week into
creations-chat 2020-11-25 14:46:46 also i found some tutorial boy with his tutorial followed ufo that he found on yt tryna photo bomb my trash. also yeah sending vids with an 8MB LIMIT is a bit little discord but if you want 100 you can bUy nItRo

bot-central 2020-12-04 00:24:24 =skip
creations-chat 2021-07-20 15:25:58 the creations are cool, i just hate to see some people be regected becuase they dont have a build that has 1.2 million parts or doesnt have enough moving parts and is not a realistic build
