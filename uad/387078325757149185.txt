The Tale of _b17 (387078325757149185)
general 2018-10-05 13:47:05 Oof
the-dump 2018-10-20 20:45:56 Save naval 1918
the-dump 2018-10-20 20:46:03 Movement of 2018
the-dump 2018-10-20 20:46:04 reee
the-dump 2018-10-20 20:46:23 I don't have a screen shot of naval 1918
the-dump 2018-10-20 20:46:24 Oof
the-dump 2018-10-21 00:55:41 Illuminati confirmed there is a eye  near the corner of it
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:15:57 the weight of a wegde is 0.5 using blocks as units im assuming, right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:16:35 I need to know because im uhh building  a balance system for something im creating
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:17:14 Yeah im using ballasts, so then in that case
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:18:01 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:18:05 Yeah, alright.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:18:24 I can test your theory actually using normal blocks lockheed
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:18:27 ill be back in a sec
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:22:48 apparently the ballast measurement affects bouyancy, either that or you were wrong, i rounded to 4 when the calculations said 1 density ballasts would equal 3.57 blocks, too, So i dont know man.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:23:06 Cuz the uhh blocks floated.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:25:41 1 regular block? alright
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:27:40 Nope, ballast sunk to a certain point, regular block stayed ontop of the water.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:29:13 the ballast didn't float back up or submerge further which is pretty interesting, i might be able to calculate how much 1 density is by simply adding blocks till they submerge as far as the ballast did.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:30:56 Im trying to figure out the weight of a single block.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:31:31 which i actually just realized,
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:31:36 would work better with a scale.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:32:21 Lol. nice, ill make one too though so we can fact check each others work
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:32:52 well, again, might as well test first
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:37:15 wait what
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:37:27 i swear to you cameras are not weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:37:50 i swear to god unless my eyes are decieving me the centre of mass on my UAV changed when i placed a camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:38:54 wait you can attach cameras to other cameras?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:38:58 i didn't know that
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:39:19 well i got my answer so
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:23 banana, they arent weightless.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:39 They are simply so light the movement is barely noticable.
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:15:24 The beams weigh the same amount as the amount of blocks they  contain, i tested with 3 block wegde
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:17:18 Am i the only one who realized half blocks and half wegde 2's can be used to make your airplane's hull half the weight or was that already discovered
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:19:44 yes finally cultured person
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:19:46 tell me how it turns
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:05 i do not know how a tank turns
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:28 How does it turn? like a normal car or what im confused
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:45 i need to know for epic tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:39:14 Yo, anybody able to tell me the weight of a jet engine? i can test it on my own right now but i wanna see if anybody knows it first since it would be much simpler.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:40:18 Yeah fair point, im trying to make  a uhh plane and i need to know the exact force it gives off so i can tell how many ill need
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:40:22 ill just test
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:42:03 Hoverdrives  feels like cheating, plus i want a certain acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:42:54 I mean i want a specific speed for the plane.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:38 Again, hover drives feel like cheating, and i don't want to go mach 1.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:00 well i do but thats not the point
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:40 I don't want to motorlock super rockets either.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:45 Nor have i ever done so.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:08 I already said, jet engines.
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:27 Nevermind, i already found their weight anyway.
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:22:51 What the heck does the reset thing on motor2 do?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:23:14 My bad i meant motor 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:24:16 so it just..
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:24:25 does a 360 degree turn?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:26:01 Oh, alright
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:26:26 So its basically just motor2's servo mode but without the servo part
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:26:34 i mean without the max angle sorry
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:33:31 Both my second helicopter and my first recreation so im wondering how i can improve [Blackhawk]
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:38:07 Oh yeah the cockpit doors aren't non existant, they are just opened trap doors
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:58:27 I know about the blackhawk doors and such, Sadly i couldn't think of a way to keep the heli stable enough or allow exiting in the air without using pistons which make it pretty ugly, For the stabilizors i would use them except i didn't really want to build them, for the tail your absolutely correct but i didn't want to oversize it + i might bring this thing into pvp and big tails dont work well for pvp, thanks for the uhh constructive criticism though
creations-chat 2021-01-18 23:01:19 Looks good, If i learned anything from KSP though adding wing panels means your going to have to make that thing super balanced lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 02:22:11 What does restitution do on rope?
creations-chat 2021-01-20 15:18:55 So uh he removed the downvote apparently.
creations-chat 2021-01-20 15:57:10 You could make the front better using triangle wegdes and triangle wegde blocks in a specific pattern
creations-chat 2021-01-20 16:03:59 Yo vmp i can show you, mind if i dm you though since this is creations feedback?

help 2021-08-08 01:53:24 how many blocks do i need per block of helium to have the helium cause hovering?
help 2021-08-08 01:54:01 ^at the very least near hovering
creations-chat 2021-11-18 03:23:22 I upsized  a patrol boat i made's hull to make a cruiser hull i guess
creations-chat 2021-11-18 03:25:37 thats just plane crazy limitations
creations-chat 2021-11-18 03:44:22 I mean, the man do be acting a bit disrespectful while giving feedback
creations-chat 2021-11-18 03:48:10 woulnt halfblocks cause a imbalance in things disconnectors are needed for such as bombs
