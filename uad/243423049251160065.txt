plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:08:45 A question, has anyone tried doing a two legged walker?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:16:28 the walker KV is from an aprils joke
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:16:49 and mostly vehicles were uncovered, there's really nothing "secret" out there anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:17:27 if you see anything that looks a tad bit weird there's a chance that it's like a model
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:17:46 search for the grotte heavy tank concept
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:22:47 No, that's the E-100 hull
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:23:33 It looks cool and all but it's nowhere practical
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:24:02 The elevation on that thing and the turning rate pretty much suck
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:24:45 You drive it up, if you're lucky to not run into anything with a cannon caliber higher than 100mm you're fine and dandy
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:25:15 Anti concrete shells
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:25:39 Rocket launchers fall under 100mm
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:26:27 The main gun usually does the job
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:26:55 Even so, strapping two 88's together is going to be a fun time for the team of loaders inside the cramped turret.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:27:16 Oh yeah planes would get rid of that as soon as it leaves factory
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:27:32 That is if a bomb does not make the factory just collapse ontop of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:28:21 Also the fact that germany never had enough fuel to keep all of it's big tanks running
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:28:41 and the fact that their transmissions would break after a very short distance
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:29:15 Crews would straight up abandon those if they could not be fixed or refueled
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:29:44 Might be the reason why you could find so many abandoned tigers around the roads in belgium after the war
creations-chat 2018-12-20 16:41:32 Has anyone managed to make tank tracks that actually work?
creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:35:14 Right so, I need to find a way to make somenthing like
creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:35:18 Slide out
creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:35:46 Like a window, y'know how you're able to slide some like up and down
creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:37:31 alright
