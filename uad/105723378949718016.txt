plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:52:53 Hello
creations-chat 2019-01-11 17:57:18 Modified Lancaster bomber used for dambusting http://prntscr.com/m5y7ug
creations-chat 2019-01-11 17:57:57 The bouncing bomb has functionality but I've tried hard enough to comply with roblox's water physics..
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:58:40 I'll say
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:59:09 I've made a steamship that can waddle on land which wasn't intentionally designed
creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:02:39 Also, this steamship was primarily used as an experiment on buoyancy and paddle propulsion. Somehow can waddle on land which isn't intentionally designed! http://prntscr.com/m5y9yi
creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:02:54 I codenamed it the Windbag
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:03:26 It's too far gone sadly
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:03:46 If there needs to be any massive improvement, they would need to remake it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:06:02 Not even C++?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:07:03 What I'm basically saying is that a complete remake will get the codes straight, instead of trying to untangle spaghetti code
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:07:49 You know what spaghetti looks like
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:08:24 Then why is it not doing good at it's job?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:08:58 Just as I figured
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:09:41 It's been existing for more than a decade now
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:10:10 And boy I miss the times when you freebuild
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:10:18 Oh, right.
general 2019-01-11 18:10:56 Anyway, as I was saying
general 2019-01-11 18:12:00 I miss the times when Tickets was the go-to currency for starting players, freebuild in the mountains which is made out of blocks and wedges... and places that allow the gears you bought from the catalog
general 2019-01-11 18:12:18 And safechat. I miss that thing
creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:16:24 I forgot to mention that the Lancaster bomber contains at least 700 blocks and the Windbag containing just about 1000 blocks
general 2019-01-11 18:16:40 Yep

creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:32:17 With the use of a motor rotating the wheel and on top of a motor is another one doing the steering
general 2019-01-11 18:39:52 how can you rotate your character
general 2019-01-11 18:40:39 I meant changing direction instead of moving your head
general 2019-01-11 18:41:05 Does nothing
general 2019-01-11 18:41:32 My line of fire is stuck in one position
creations-chat 2019-01-11 20:01:42 Eh I just use wheels for the tanks
creations-chat 2019-01-11 20:02:00 Problem is that my physics is throttled to 12% when I try to drive it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:02:47 Apparently you can lag the server with magets
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:03:37 Also I've once seen someone made an anti-rocket tower that embraces lag to deflect rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:35:32 You know what's the most annoying thing about roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:35:44 meshes that doesn't have an outline
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:22:23 Would be nice if we had a surface tool to stop adjacent blocks from welding each other
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:32:01 I wish I can submit a suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:33:05 Where is that carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:36:27 Did some carbon based lifeform just say "Rick"
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:36:33 *Rickrolled*
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:37:04 It existed in 2015?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:37:17 Boy I wished I noticed it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:38:24 I'm challenging myself to get Master Replicator
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:39:33 All I need to do is get a large plane from some special detachment and replicate it using limited resources and processing power, while keeping core functionality
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:02:53 Is Light Speed possible?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:03:39 Well I have to do something that physics says "It's impossible"
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:15:35 Any more information about light speed before I convert my Lancaster SD bomber into a exosphere climber
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:26:41 Requesting Master rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:16:58 Not really
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:17:20 Only when I start driving
general 2019-01-11 23:18:33 
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:20:21 I just realised that one plane will be impossible to build in the game cos of how weight is distributed
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:20:39 Avro Vulcan
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:21:20 That's the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:21:33 Ballasts don't do much either
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:22:03 I knew it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:22:29 Also for some strange reason my planes now start buffeting near 600 spd
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:22:45 Or fishtailing
help 2019-01-12 10:10:03 For some reason the deHavilland Comet Racer I have built ingame has a very low stall speed, but also doesn't manage energy well]
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 10:12:50 Anyone noticed that the colour picker is broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 10:13:22 For example colour code 327 is conflicted with 200 0 0 and uh.. I might need to check again ingame
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 10:16:01 Oh gosh I can't remember what the one colour was
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 10:43:37 That guy must be jealous that they can't build like them

help 2019-01-13 14:59:39 Aileron roll is a move that you solely use the ailerons to roll the aircraft. In other words, Ailerons are the  control surfaces on your wings

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 17:14:15 Noice
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:46:46 The reason why it's slow at a high speed is due to the physics engine throttling

plane-crazy 2019-01-14 18:18:40 Too bad

**Comment:** *Yes, it is rather blocky, but that is how I build my models. Trying to find a compromise between design and practical use, while retaining simplicity.* Complete with 3 functioning turrets with a top speed of 334 at level flight.
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:35:26 In case someone recognises this from before, this is a remodelled version, to include turrets and swapping back to conventional bomb bay.
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:39:42 I'm well aware
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:40:08 I specified the rank because of the block count.
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:49:24 HMS Windbag | Galaxy_Boy | Block count: 2131 | Rank requested: Master Engineer
**Comment:** This was originally a prototype ship to test water physics using motor-driven paddles and wing rudders. Pleased with the results of the speed and handling, I went on to fashion this into a pirate ship. Eventually by accident and against it's original intents, it could waddle on relatively flat land! So it could conquer sea and land... but what about the air? That's when I decided to slap on a massive balloon and it flew... badly. It can fly, just not steer very well.
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:53:53 **Continued**
Nonetheless, it has been my largest and most adaptive build I have ever done. Unfortunately the time has come to throw anchor on it. With the physics engine throttling to 12% on large builds and being outcompeted by more advanced builds and the short save space means I cannot work on it any longer.

*The Matilda is a heavy cruiser designed by me. It sports 2 main calibre Mk IV turrets and one auxiliary Mk I turret capable of dishing out tremendous firepower with good accuracy. The powerhouse of this cruiser remains classified but can give a great top speed of 96 on full  speed astern.*
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:27:15 I called it a heavy cruiser cos of the large turrets
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:27:23 Normally it's just a cruiser
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:27:47 And for some godforsaken reason "gunboat" doesn't exist. All I can find is MTB
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:46:59 Yeah but it's massive on my plot, mainly cos I don't like folding builds
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:48:57 Also I updated it to have cameras for more accuracy, giving a total amount of blocks in the build of ***LEET***
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 12:55:17 Are you stacking motors?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 12:56:21 Maybe max out the torque?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 12:59:04 Also if you spam the locking, the prismatic will then trail away from it's original position when the vehicle is moving

help 2019-09-03 07:59:05 Please explain
help 2019-09-03 08:04:22 I can not hear other players after joining as well
help 2019-09-03 08:05:52 I've listed what made sounds and those that dont earlier
Other games aren't affected, just Plane Crazy
help 2019-09-03 08:06:53 I even tried reinstalling roblox but that only worked *once*
help 2019-09-03 08:09:13 The other day when the update came out, props weren't playing sound and the sounds of other engines like rockets stuttered when you increase or decrease the throttle
help 2019-09-03 08:10:25 This is as far as I know and I don't have any clues linking to it
help 2019-09-03 08:21:49 Apparently it's not just me cos some other people in the server can't either

help 2019-09-03 09:31:11 For creations where it is not possible to relocate the landing gears, I would suggest making a small pair of wings with a motor near the front of the plane to act as flaps. Due to the physics ingame, real life flaps would behave the opposite

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:03:23 How much practicality can you put into a torpedo before it becomes unpractical
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:04:37 Like, 2 plane steering, under surface guiding, wire controlled

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:10:49 What would help with anti-rolling, 100 stiffness or 50 stiffness on the suspension? My car has a low center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:11:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:11:43 Unfortunately my car is only 1 block high
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:12:25 And I've already put the ride height so low I would scrape the marmalade off the toast
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:13:06 I would do that, but that would strip its ability to keep all wheels on the uneven ground
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:13:55 Downforce helps significantly but it drastically decreases max speed and still has a critical speed where downforce doesn't prevent a roll-over
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:17:30 I glorified about my car's height a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:17:43 It's actually 2.5 blocks tall, counting the rear spoiler
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:18:15 More weight...
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:18:29 I'll just paint the entire bottom part metal

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:22:07 Like how would it balance
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:23:38 I kinda want to design it around the classic rotor and propeller system

plane-crazy 2019-09-21 08:56:47 Is good
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:03:04 I wish there are taller suspensions in build mode so I don't have to put down as many ropes which can potentially spazz out when I tension the springs
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:04:00 Or as many suspensions so the catapult can actually reach near the edge...
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:26:28 *In build mode*
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:33:14 You can't change the shape of the suspension in build mode?

plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:09 Let's be clear
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:16 That is *ironic*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:37 How? Take roblox's motto which is "Powering Imagination"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:06:05 And their website theme which is nothing but a slapped on two-tone office theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:06:40 Even ROBLOX+ finally pulled the plug on the OBC theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:07:41 Or ROBLOX+ if you paid premium for dark theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:07:58 *Quite frankly, I've became increasingly disappointed in the last few months*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:08:17 Although it comes with limited notifier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:09:03 But who cares to a person who has a robux cash flow of a ditch in the drought season
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:09:41 That's been fixed though?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:10:49 I did have a look with BTRoblox but their custom themes were only half-baked
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:12:29 I see. I can't stand getting an eyesore so intense that it would hurt less staring at a television that my mother used to complain

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:50:56 It's crazy world
general 2019-09-27 15:53:02 If only roblox made the settings more advanced in a way you can benefit from not having unnecessary frame drops
general 2019-09-27 15:53:19 Like extending render distances without an increase in graphics quality
general 2019-09-27 15:53:42 But instead of that
general 2019-09-27 15:53:53 They go faffing with the website themes
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:54:52 So I did a swashplate experiment and it has promising results
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:55:51 Only issue is that the propeller which counters the torque twisting of the main rotor is causing the helicopter to drift horizontally
general 2019-09-27 15:56:16 Not everyone can use high graphics
general 2019-09-27 15:56:36 I used to be able to run roblox comfortably at 80% 3 years ago

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:51:25 I wish the gear wheels have more friction
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:51:58 Cos I have to apply downforce to my plane in order to steer sufficiently enough
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:52:09 Those gear wheels just slide all over the place
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:40:42 I hate how the spring becomes either stupidly weak or not work at all when it activates with *break weld*
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:41:04 I have to wait until it retracts and then activate again for the full strength
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:41:21 Suspension too big in build mode
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:12 I got a number of ejector seats prototypes built
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:23 And only one works reliably
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:59 Spring is basically suspension except pre-tensioned
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:51:28 Eh?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:51:31 I thought it's released
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:53:55 Oh for goodness sake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:05 Suspension is more reliable than springs but
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:14 I can't fit it inside a jet because of how big suspension is
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:34 In motor2?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:46 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:56 Turn off servo for mouse aiming
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:59:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:59:37 Whitelist has been suggested a lot but is not planned atm
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 17:02:53 Or by the amount of hashtags they are spewing out
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 17:33:28 I kinda ashamed that I won't be roleplaying in the badlands anytime soon

plane-crazy 2019-09-30 22:00:35 They have a mafia?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:25:55 Is it me or people started to expect higher expectations in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:07 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:42 Like the latest creation which last year might be expected 2 dislikes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:50 Now it's tripled
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 17:52:49 Hmmst
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 17:53:30 TFW you try to make the EE Lightning ingame but 1x1 and 3x3 engines are too large/small
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:28:36 Would be nice if the strength of pistons would be buffed or rope have an acceleration slider
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:37:15 What does it mean if my aircraft fishtails left to right at speed?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:41:31 What does it mean when my aircraft fishtails at high speeds / near large builds?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:42:34 Left to right yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:43:36 Welp there goes my plans to make a high speed interceptor
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:44:08 It's impossible for me to go past 550 spd without experiencing loss of controls
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:37:50 *Do you like anime?*
That's a complicated question.
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:03:54 What's superstrength on magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:04:36 Either I'm using it wrong or it's just not strong enough compared to half-pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:20:01 What is superstrength on the magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:21:20 Seriously though
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:21:24 It did nothing what I expected
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:22:24 Absolutely nothing except trying to lag the server
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:22:37 I was trying to replace the pistons which are too weak
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:39:46 Magnets with "superstrength"
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:39:59 They aren't exactly superheroes though
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 15:26:03 I'm not complaining or anything but magnets and their "superstrength" is just far weaker than I expected
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:12:56 Well.. the Peel P55
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:13:17 It isn't? Clarkson design it didn't he?
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:13:43 Ah beg your pardon
creations-chat 2019-10-05 19:59:20 Bruh a flying brick taken literally
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 19:18:34 Ironically speaking, nothing is stronger than pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:08:14 How does one build a rocket with engines at the bottom instead of being at the top where it is more stable
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:09:19 Isn't this plane crazy channel designated for plane crazy discussions only?
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:44:41 Building the perfect fighter jet is more complicated than I thought
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:45:20 Because of physics lag, I can't build it so small that physics can't keep up, nor build it so big that physics starts throttling back
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:20:23 I just realised that I have my own "physical barrier" similar to the sonic boom
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:20:57 Except it doesn't stabilise the aircraft when it exceeds the barrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:35 Quite frankly, in order to fly faster than that barrier, I need to build an aircraft big enough to not buffet to oblivion past 450 speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:23:14 So I've accidentally made my replication of the *Javelin* which is a subsonic FAW, a supersonic FB ingame
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:10 Although I'm throttled to 33% physics speed so I wasn't actually doing 662 speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:35 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:46 I wanna go on a cruise flight
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:25:11 Actually that'll be fun, flying from airport to other airports
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:25:18 Across the sea
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:15 I'm pretty sure "bigger map" was already suggested
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:38 So how do I make roblox think that my pc is faster than it is
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:47 Cos 12% physics speed is anything but fun

plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:11:48 How compact are retractable custom landing gears?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:15:33 I'm working on a prototype helicopter, and no matter what I do, it always tries to pitch up, even the COM is center of the main rotor's motor
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:51:38 My heli requests super strong pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:51:44 Even ice just won't cut it
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:52:36 At least I switched over to motor2 but I still have another problem
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:04 I don't have a computer to control the heli to stop it from falling out of the sky
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:28 I need to test it with my biplane later - it's prone to spazzing out from physics lag
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:54:40 I just realised my bulldozer can't make it into the battlebots arena ;(

plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:55:17 Cos the entire blade is made entirely of cutters
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:58:43 What are the requirements for battlebots, aside the cutter limit?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:26:46 Does the battlebot have to be within 10x10x10 space?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:30:38 No ballast blocks either?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:30:49 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:31:03 I'm just about to be finished with my first battlebot

creations-chat 2019-10-25 20:02:31 Cos I rarely use magnets and I never designed a railgun before
creations-chat 2019-10-25 20:03:28 Like, how is it set out, does the projectile also need magnets, what does the barrel look like, etc
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 20:43:37 I wish I can materialise the magnets into ice
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:18:32 Which way on the magnets is forwards and backwards?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:21:48 Which way on the magnets is forwards and backwards?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:22:30 They should have just named it attract and repel
help 2019-10-25 23:39:35 My railgun features a magazine feed system with a spring, but it frequently fails to feed a projectile into the chamber. What could it be? (occasionally tries to flip projectile 90 degrees while attempting to feed into chamber / gets stuck halfway in the barrel)
help 2019-10-25 23:51:04 Well this is typical every time I try get help.
I'll just go to sleep then...
help 2019-10-25 23:51:32 Yeah I'll do that tomorrow
help 2019-10-26 10:56:36 Okay I've fixed the feeding issue so it's less of a problem
Now I've got another problem..
Every time I fire a 1x4 projectile, it has a chance of getting questionably stuck between the blocks that make up the barrel. The gun runs on 10 super magnets in front of the projectile chamber where reloading takes place

general 2019-10-26 14:39:31 How does one make a hoverboard ingame
general 2019-10-26 14:45:52 So you're dropping from a standstill?
general 2019-10-26 14:47:14 Either way, don't use wing panels cos they will severely reduce speed and possibly cause the bomb to spin erratically, especially at high speeds
general 2019-10-26 14:50:41 Bombing from an altitude that high... It's more effective to just carpet bomb

plane-crazy 2019-10-26 18:54:14 I think this next creation of mine will give me the inventor rank :)
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:19:12 (Requesting Inventor rank)
Build name: Python Turboprop
Part count: 145 (Including test rig)

Comment: Behold! The Armstrong Siddeley Python turboprop engine that features contra-rotating propellers!
In game, there are no need for extra motors to counter the 1st set of motors speed for the second set! It has been tuned to be relatively stable from physical shocks. The test rig carries 8 ballast beams set to 40 due to the sheer acceleration it dishes out.
https://streamable.com/4behq
The engine will be fitted into my upcoming Westland Wyvern aircraft soon.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:20:22 I think I went a *little* overboard with the description. Oh well..

creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:26:58 Never seen anybody make a motor engine that contra-rotates without extra motors to neutralise the speed on the first set of motors
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:28:53 Bruh. I suppose I made a swashplate helicopter but I guess somebody *already did that?*
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:29:04 Eh?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:29:20 That's not exactly fashionable is it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:30:06 Also why is one propeller spinning faster than the other?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:31:10 *visible confusion* How is that considered something that has put effort in it
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:31:59 So is mine, but it will be used for another build

plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:43:36 Ark Royal? Sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:43:59 Ah yes. She's a beast.
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:44:49 Although I liked the HMS *Illustrious* cos it carried Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:46:17 Oh well, it's cool. How does it handle?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:47:56 Same to one of my cars when it kept flipping over when I try to turn at 300 spd
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:49:03 Yeah except mine goes to 400 cos of the spoilers required for me to drive better offroad
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:49:22 Funny I used control surfaces instead
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:50:20 wydm many ships are NSFW?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:51:20 Because we are so good that we have to always give our enemies a sporting chance
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:52:01 Problem with that is you're trading max speed for increased control
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:53:31 If you're thinking about the Bismarck, just remember the time that all it took was a squadron of swordfish to cripple her
creations-chat 2019-10-26 20:54:27 I think about speed to evade predators in the arena
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:54:58 No that's the Lancaster with their Tallboy bombs
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:55:42 Wait you're thinking about the Taranto raid?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:58:57 Anyway I'm gonna go play WT with the Wyvern
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:00:24 Lmao I'm upvoting that suggestion just because it's funny to add a quote
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:01:11 Wow. Weird that I'm seeing quite a few of similar builds to that lately
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:01:30 Not a lot, just a few
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:02:32 I feel you
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:03:15 I can relate to that - Trying to come up with a radical thing just to get a rank takes ages and when you post it, people claim that it's already been done before
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:03:46 *Just why does the inventor rank have to be that hard?* 😦
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:05:55 Working gearbox? Done before. Swashplate helicopter? Not on your nelly. 90% Efficiency contra-rotating turboprop engine that replicates the model from Armstrong Siddeley's Python? Yeah... no.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:06:24 Plus a few others
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:06:44 Cylinders, pistons and motors
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:06:58 Although their grip is a bit weak
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:08:11 I tried using magnets as a way of making propellers contra-rotate, but their efficiency is appalling
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:08:40 Oh wait, that's not it, I was making a clutch system
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:09:44 I don't know what is with magnets, but they keep making my railgun projectiles fling out before they reached halfway out of the barrel
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:10:32 I can do that
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:10:44 Just give me two months to get the curves right
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:11:07 And you'll see the naval strike fighter
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:11:58 Quite frankly your jet is better looking than my best jet rn
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:13:03 I made a steam-rolling battle bot, but it was so front-heavy with the cutters that it wasn't practical to continue developing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:14:23 Servo disables the motor2 from moving by mouse movement
Instead becomes more or less like a motorised hinge
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:14:51 Ideal for restricting angle to prevent builds from glitching out
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:15:36 Anyone want to see my version of the swashplate helicopter?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:16:18 Mind you, it's an ugly piece of hardware
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:16:28 Looks like a dog's breakfast to me
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:16:52 It's the satisfaction that makes them look beautiful

creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:27 Oh my god were they stupidly weak
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:45 So I switched over to using motor2s and levers

creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:06:31 Although if you think it's "basic", at least give some construction criticism instead of leaving creators in the dark
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:08:44 Some ships can be like that, usually interceptors or blockade runners
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 08:09:54 I wonder when we'll receive double-sided motors? Y'know, act as ball bearings or 2-n-1
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:12:38 Instead of wedges, maybe use half-blocks?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:13:19 I can relate - I intend to make most of my builds simple
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:13:51 But at the end of the day, I just have to keep experimenting
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:14:44 Anyway I'm gonna go install a bearing on that turboprop engine to make it more stable at higher torques
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 08:22:35 Why does adding a few propeller blades cause the entire build to spazz out?

plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:03:29 <@!435864400235200522> Yes they can at red fuel stations, even those that aren't connected to the vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:04:02 Funnyingly enough, people complain that this game isn't realistic
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:04:25 But they probably didn't notice that fuel blocks change their weight based on the amount of fuel inside
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:05:17 The weight different isn't that significant though
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:06:41 If you don't know if you're going to get warned for saying something, don't say it
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:07:12 Indeed. It had a bad history

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:57:17 Not easy trying to make a build that everyone will like
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:58:15 I have another plane in the works but I'm not motivated to build it cos nobody gives me constructive critism on my older builds

creations-chat 2019-11-17 11:08:36 Best way to avoid the chance of being outdone is to build something that is not popular irl
creations-chat 2019-11-17 11:08:47 Like the dreaded Blackburn Firebrand

general 2019-11-24 19:59:03 If god exists, why is there evil and suffering in the world
general 2019-11-24 19:59:23 So in clarification, roblox is ignorant
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:01:12 Next time sing along the number line all the way to infinity
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:04:15 Are those hands?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:04:46 Well that's handy
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:05:04 Not saying I could use a hand here
general 2019-11-24 22:26:14 Well if you're concerned, don't do it
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 22:30:00 Y'know I've seen a mending book being traded for 7 emeralds and a book
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:21:49 What's with the bot that randomly posts an image of a dice
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:22:32 A die is nice and all, but I respect the 8-Ball more than the fair-sided die
general 2019-11-25 20:23:43 You could say
general 2019-11-25 20:23:50 ***...Cool.***
the-dump 2019-11-25 20:24:23 Let's face it
the-dump 2019-11-25 20:25:00 The electric truck thing
the-dump 2019-11-25 20:25:12 Is worse than I thought because I realised

the-dump 2019-11-25 20:32:17 You can't warn another mod without minimodding
the-dump 2019-11-25 20:33:10 Well actually it's possible if you justify against them
general 2019-11-25 21:33:22 When your ship doesn't know how to ship http://prntscr.com/q1zjls
general 2019-11-25 21:33:53 I wonder if listening to *Drunken Sea Sailor* has anything to do with this
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:42:57 I did have a plane that had a tighter turn circle of less than 1s
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:04 But it was useless because... well
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:16 When I spawn it in, it spazzes the moment it touches the ground
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:52 PvP is great because I can durability test my aircraft and effectiveness of my AAA against fast targets
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:05 But at the same time, those *bloody killboxes* ruin the fun
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:27 They make a box on wheels, slapped some guns and stuff on it and called it a day
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:33 Where's the art in that?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:45:35 Speaking of design, I always wanted to build a replica of a fighter-bomber from the 40's
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:46:07 But I can't because every time I go build it, I immediately get depressed because I keep thinking about <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:48:58 I *had* a rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:49:06 But it was made obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:49:48 Cos everyone was like
*Hey let's go ask Clang to send us twice the speed of light!*
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:50:05 And so that rank was gone
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:50:57 Now if you excuse me
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:51:12 I need to go upload some images to get the two ranks I should have gotten several months ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:17 Wait a minute
Didn't I apply for a mod several months ago?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:29 Oh well...
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:56 That's a shame cos I had potential
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:53:31 I'm in no position to hate or like furries
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:53:55 In fact they're all the same
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:54:18 What I mean by that, is the frequency of content
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:54:37 If you like try take over the entire text channel then I would be bothered about it very much
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:26 It's about equality
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:34 Everyone should get their fair share
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:45 Otherwise get the heccin outta here
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:56:21 Good point because I don't have faith in humanity
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:56:34 I just don't trust anyone anymore
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:57:59 I'm gonna check my 8-ball to see if my foresight is true
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:58:48 I foresee that in the next decade there will be another world war
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:00 You have my word
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:26 Well that's up to you
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:32 Ignore it or accept it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:00:34 Bruh a suicide mission is just an excuse to distract the opponent
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:00:52 Well anyone heard of Build & Race
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:16 Last one went dead because roblox changed their save system
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:40 No you're right
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:49 Just like in the Great war
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:02:22 Why is it even called the Great war when the Battle of the Somme slaughtered hundred thousands?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:10:52 Also what's with the anchored block?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:11:24 I use the old anchor block so my creation doesn't lag when it's stationary

general 2019-12-05 20:27:18 Is it some sort of under 12's slang
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 21:24:20 Discord API was failing
general 2019-12-12 20:10:31 wtf is that roblox's new playerlist gui thing
general 2019-12-12 20:10:40 It's so obstructive
general 2020-01-01 13:59:55 I wonder how few people know about this proposal to replace the "oof" sound
general 2020-01-01 14:10:36 To avoid legal troubles
general 2020-01-01 14:10:50 Ironically the "oof" sound didn't originate from roblox
general 2020-01-01 14:11:25 They claim that removing the "oof" will avoid legal trouble, but that's just jumping to conclusions
general 2020-01-01 14:12:01 It's been confirmed that the original creator of that "oof" states that it was an honour to see it used and didn't mind it
general 2020-01-01 14:13:12 By the decree of roblox's past, it's a felony to die
general 2020-01-01 14:14:57 I was in the same boat but in a different game
general 2020-01-01 14:15:16 When roblox introduced FE, save data fell apart in old games
general 2020-01-01 14:15:24 So there goes +40 hours of work
general 2020-01-01 14:16:06 I believe that's because you joined a server you previously was in
general 2020-01-01 14:16:55 Old servers don't tend to recognise changes made
general 2020-01-01 14:18:14 Same yesterday but I only spawned in the middle of nowhere
general 2020-01-01 14:18:28 With no owned base
general 2020-01-01 14:19:46 It's doo doo because roblox tries too hard and makes things worse
general 2020-01-01 14:19:53 Like Rthro packages
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:00:42 Firework rockets make excellent flak... if only the range was significantly increased
bot-central 2020-01-01 22:02:20 ?whois <@!105723378949718016>
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:04 What do people mean that pvp rockets were obsolete?
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:28 Well yes but that's not what I mean
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:35 What made them obsolete
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:16 I generally still use rockets because fireworks just don't have the range
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:32 I thought I could use them as flak but it's pitiful
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:59 And somehow rockets no longer self-detonate
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:12 I have built a heli based on the swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:31 But due to the nature of roblox, I can't fly it properly
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:43 Physics throttling is the main issue
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:01:46 People keep telling me to get a new pc but that's easier said than done
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:11:38 in terms of combat effectiveness, how effective is strapping a load of guns onto a rotating 3x3 cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:11:46 Say, against air targets
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:13:17 Cos apparently it causes the rounds to scatter depending on the speed of the spin
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:17:44 This is gonna be interesting when I strap a rudimentary GAU gun to a Javelin
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 18:29:39 I just noticed the hammer emoji on the game name - Does that mean the map expansion is currently underway?
general 2020-01-15 22:48:32 I was spam hovering my mouse over that nitro notification icon thing and this popped up http://prntscr.com/qo9umk
general 2020-02-02 09:16:52 That ship reminds me of the book *Illuminae*
general 2020-02-02 09:20:45 I think the related ship is called the Alexander-78V, a heavy Battlecarrier
general 2020-02-20 09:28:33 Apparently roblox has a web threat on their website
general 2020-02-20 09:28:53 Well, two even though they look identically similar
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:29:50 I fear the hover blocks will be overshadowing the wheels because of their excellent ability to traverse terrain
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:30:33 You have a decent point, although wheels are really underpowered when it comes to inclines
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:31:35 It reminds me of the book *Hover Car Racer*

general 2020-02-29 11:13:28 I'd wouldn't be sure about that
general 2020-02-29 11:14:02 Some script platforms like Java suffer considerably if given too much ram than the program needs
general 2020-02-29 11:14:32 So you can crash programs if you, say allocate them 8 gigs of excessive ram

plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:21:06 What does most engaging mean?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:21:18 Does it mean by overall playtime of players?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:25:22 I guess it makes sense cos most people join with ideas but their dedication drains extremely quickly
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:46:32 I just noticed that you can now shut off the rocket engines from emitting particles

general 2020-03-20 08:24:03 If I have better understanding of how to detail builds, I could make a ship larger than what I currently have in my possession
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:32:18 I'm surprised you use engines instead of harnessing roblox's water physics
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:34:41 It's not really fun when 75% of the pvp servers always contain at least one killbox

the-dump 2020-03-20 08:38:07 Dear youtube, please add repeat once for mobile on playlists
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:41:20 I've got 2 working turrets which includes the tail gunner
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:43:37 Kinda awkward to get a good camera angle but here it is: http://prntscr.com/rjhjyp
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:45:45 It was a lengthy process of figuring out how to get as much horizontal angle out of it without damaging the looks too much
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:48:06 I can't
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:49:21 If I go any bigger, my frames will drop significantly
Also the physics is throttled down to 12% cos of how big it already is
general 2020-03-20 08:50:46 Never had that issue before
general 2020-03-20 08:51:09 But that's coming from the guy who plays the outdated offline GtaV on 360
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:51:44 Already have that
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:52:43 Also physics is very weird on me
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:53:24 I build something big but it gets throttled back
I build a small aircraft and the top speed is harshly impoverished by the severe buffeting
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:54:20 I build something else that's big-ish and it starts buffeting madly past 100
general 2020-03-20 08:54:52 Don't think so
general 2020-03-20 08:55:09 Last time I updated it was early 2019 I think
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:56:37 I hate an engine that has tight tolerances which is next-to-impossible to iron out

plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:07:24 I have a mouse-guided missile
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:07:44 But for some reason it likes to wobble uncontrollably at medium speeds
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:08:31 And it's a pretty big missile as well
I even need to give it a ramp to take off
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:08:42 And in most cases... it just gets stuck on the ramp
creations-chat 2020-03-20 10:09:18 Perhaps I am worse

plane-crazy 2020-03-22 13:28:05 Cos I'm having trouble keeping 1x1 tubes compact
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 13:30:21 nvm the propeller engine seems to magically weld to the block in front that isn't supposed to touch
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:21 My god what's wrong with the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:45 My torpedo tube worked fine until I added disconnectors to improve framerate
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:58 Now it won't move out of the tube
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:18:22 It's connected to nothing except the disconnector
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:18:49 I have problems with ice
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:19:12 Most of the time it won't work
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:13:28 So roblox is racist?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:16:04 Roblox: Goes out of their way to make their website more accessible for other languages
Also roblox: Slaps the censor on almost every foreign word on chat.
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:17:14 Somehow in the catalog, badass isn't censored despite the word in part of that word
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:17:44 Cos crap isn't actually strong enough to be a swear word
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:19:31 Other letters?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:20:04 It's weird that any word that relates to the LGBT was censored but it's mostly lifted 2-3 years ago
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:20:51 I don't think you can say "Beavis and Butthead"
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:22:07 so quad j's confuse the filter?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:23:04 I remember the time I was so into a roblox game that I actually subconsciously swore in the chat when I screwed something up quite badly
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:23:54 likewise

general 2020-03-22 19:51:47 First and foremost, are on you pc or mobile? And do they have "Automatic Controls" ticked or not?
general 2020-03-22 19:52:51 What automatic controls does is that they will try follow your mouse although not always have intended behaviour
general 2020-03-22 19:53:54 A lot of people untick auto controls altogether and use key controls instead because it's more reliable
general 2020-03-22 19:55:36 Aircraft with a short fuselage can turn quite well and the more control surfaces you have instead of panels, the more sensitive the controls will be
general 2020-03-22 20:01:56 When the aircraft with motor2 control surfaces wobbles, is it because the motors are overcompensating?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 19:09:49 Do anyone use some sort of arrestor wire or catapult on their carriers?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 19:10:30 I've built and tested an arrestor hook on the train station roof and seems to work quite well

plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:22:37 That's funny cos I see no difference
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:23:18 I originally thought fixed would be like smoke particles would be static

plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:31:46 I could only get up to 720 speed before I reached the end of the plots baseplate :T
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:32:08 10 5x5 fabric cylinder wheels aren't good enough to gain acceleration

plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:39:18 http://prntscr.com/rxhp1f
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:39:41 If I add any more, it'll start to sag from the weight
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:40:00 Believe me I tried
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:45:32 If I remove the ballasts and add 5 more pairs of 5x5 fabric cylinders, it won't sag as much, but the effect of acceleration is less
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:47:06 It makes the effect worse
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:48:06 The point of adding ballast between the wheels and the motors is to increase the wheel's weight, forcing the wheel down onto the ground more to gain more traction

bug-reports 2020-04-13 12:55:57 Motor block appears to occasionally reset to the opposite of the original angle when spun over. Possibly due to the script reading 180 degrees as 0.
Test this by attaching a marker block (to indicate angle) to a 3x3 or 5x5 cylinder, that's attached to a motor and spin it over.
Note: I did not use the "Toggle" option.

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:42:04 Motors are bloody weird cos half of my creations work fine with them, while some just spazzes out
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:43:55 And a minute ago, the motor responsible for the gun elevation was just seesawing the entire thing, while the horizontal drive motor would spazz the whole creation by the slight]est touch
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:44:28 And I lost connection before I saved...
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:45:16 It shouldn't be
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:45:58 For instance, my tennis ball serving machine has a lot more stress on physics and lags a lot more than my prototype fullauto gun

help 2020-04-13 13:49:01 What's the RPM of the motor at say, speed of 1?
help 2020-04-13 13:49:52 In general so I can have a vague idea of the RPMs my autoloader could do
help 2020-04-13 13:51:12 Only the motor
help 2020-04-13 13:52:03 Or the degrees per second with the speed of 1
help 2020-04-13 14:01:53 Okay so it did roughly 16 revolutions in 10 seconds with 10 speed...
help 2020-04-13 14:03:25 So in 1 minute, it'd do roughly 9.1 revolutions per minute
help 2020-04-13 14:03:29 At 1 speed
help 2020-04-13 14:04:10 Regardless of where you place them, it'll have the same performance
help 2020-04-13 14:04:54 There's no "air" in roblox so basically indoors is the same as outdoors
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:05:36 Apparently the RPM of the motor at 1 speed is 9.6
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:06:54 Although not measured accurately cos I was only using my eyes to lap each revolution for roughly 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:08:00 So at maximum speed, the motor could chug out roughly 480 rpm
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:25 I expect it to do so as it's rather dense irl
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:41 But in PC... material is just a texture change
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:54 With the exception of ice and fabric of course
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:11:53 Shame ballast blocks can't use different materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:12:10 I'll test that theory rn

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:25:54 I'm gonna reduce the strength of the suspension to 0.5
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:26:52 http://prntscr.com/ryhjsf
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:27:41 Apparently roblox tagged "Ice" so I used the words "Frozen Water" instead
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:28:02 Yes, and the left-most suspension is just air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:28:58 Apparently foil and ice weigh nothing compared to air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:29:48 Diamond plate surprisingly weighs the same as fabric
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:30:09 I even checked if the physics were sleeping
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:33:11 Fascinating... Diamond plate, fabric, foil and ice weighs the same as air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:33:53 The rest weigh the same as plastic
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:34:54 Wait, what?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:35:11 So is that the source of the spazzing my biplane had?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:35:19 Cos it was covered in fabric

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:41:06 Want to see it? It might shatter your mirrors though
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:41:50 I'm not ingame but I have an old video demostrating the prototype https://streamable.com/srh45
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:42:48 It doesn't have conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:43:36 There's no flare block
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:44:02 If you meant the fireworks then you just missed the winter event
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:46:14 The only build I've used conveyors on is my tennis ball serving machine
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:46:26 They work great in unjamming the hopper
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:47:47 Alright

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:01 Before conveyors, there were magnet drives
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:27 It's a compromise for lots of speed and acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:51 Er, my biplane has it but it wasn't necessary

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:58:00 Are there any magazine-type systems that don't require the ammo to be gravity fed?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:05 It is what it is: Ammo is fed into the gun breech using gravity
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:28 Although wouldn't work if the gun's sideways or upside down
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:10 I fire out explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:37 Although one of my deleted guns used cutters and 4 blocks as rails
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:01:24 Turned out to be horribly inaccurate and often times the rail gets stuck inside the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:20 Can't really see what I'm looking at tbf
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:48 I see
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:03:52 Seem to fly like a boomerang
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:30 Also my javelin jet is surprisingly too small to fit a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:06:38 My javelin seems to be smaller than that aircraft above http://prntscr.com/ryq9w1
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:07:48 But whereabouts?

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:16:58 Fabric isn't friendly on laggy computers
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:17:14 A bit of lag actually causes you to spazz out, speaking from experience
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:21:21 Oh god my control surfaces rip off very easily
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:00 Apparently I had to reintroduce my javelin to the cobra in order to considerably slow down when using the jump drive

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:25:51 I'm like *Bruh, torpedoes are relatively easy to build*
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:26:29 I've reached up to 12000 before my control surfaces started to fly away
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:26:52 Other than that, I've reached near infinity when the *Speed of light* role existed
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:28:53 I'm trying to remember what contraption I used to reach the speed of light before
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:29:17 It involved glitching through the base plot with ropes I can't remember anything else

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:19:08 In simple terms of what a gyroscope is, it's a heavy mass, spinning really fast
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:21:08 Actually on second thoughts, I haven't really designed a gyroscope that is actually useful

creations-chat 2020-04-29 17:31:42 Racing Jet Aircraft, Blizzard Mark III
Top speed: 602 (642 w/ T-Booster, 694 at 90' Dive)
Block count: 78
Max fuel consumption rate: 13/s (Capacity: 2700)
Design inspired by the book *Hover Car Racer* and the game *Jet Ion GP*. 

The mark I had large rear wings and used regular control surfaces. Unimpressed by the unnecessary drag caused by the rear wings, The mark II introduced an overhaul to the control system and wing design, with elevation trimming and movable horizontal stabilisers, achieving 500 speed.
Mark III was introduced to resolve the loss of control at speeds greater than 450. Better stability increased max speed to excess of 600.
*(There was an experimental mark IV featuring stylised wings. Flight performance concludes that it had an negative impact of top speed and roll rate. Turn rate however, improved marginally.)*
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:03 Something tells me that the majority of the community prefer large builds over micros

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:45:39 I don't think anybody can exceed the 700 speed barrier with wing panels and reasonable stability
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:46:16 I forgot to add the lines of *In level flight*
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:46:48 Cos I did so in a steep dive and I got up to 1100 speed before hitting -4800
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:47:13 Must be using a drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:47:45 Eh, I use 5 or 6 super rockets to get up to 642
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:03 Wew
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:11 Must be a lot of lag and a fuel guzzler
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:35 I've built a jet designed for endurance, speed and agility

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:07 Wait, not what
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:12 But why a specific price tag
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:23 Why not round to 300?
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:10:01 You can mute individual user's speakers

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:16:57 I can see how *terribly infuriating* the underage chat filter is
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:17:33 Oh, and roblox now moderates the game coding and scripts the devs wrote
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:17:55 Ironically speaking
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:18:07 I would prefer safechat over that unde chat filter
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:18:44 What?
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:02 I'm talking about the deprecated safechat
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:08 *I can only see menu chats*
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:50 So now roblox's studio is a hostile workspace
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:21:09 It's like school dealing with bullies all over again
general 2020-05-11 09:22:17 If we speak while exhaling, can we speak while inhaling?
general 2020-05-11 09:27:31 What does it mean to be British?
general 2020-05-11 09:28:09 Cos honestly, the most I've seen out of my people is complain about politics and yet they still watch it
general 2020-05-11 09:28:15 If you don't like it, stop watching

general 2020-05-11 20:12:39 I'm using compact mode
the-dump 2020-05-11 20:14:17 gg
the-dump 2020-05-11 20:14:17 I just got warned for reposting the video that was reposted 3 times on here
the-dump 2020-05-12 12:13:39 Uh I think Phantom Forces have already taken a step ahead
general 2020-05-12 12:14:32 Use something like Lightshot or Gayzo(?)
general 2020-05-12 15:13:57 Why is roblox removing outlines?
general 2020-05-12 15:14:33 If people don't like outlines, just disable it. It's not hard
general 2020-05-12 15:14:53 But for veterans like me I'd prefer to see outlines
general 2020-05-12 15:17:01 One dev says "gpu-friendly update"
general 2020-05-12 15:17:06 I'll tell you whats GPU friendly
general 2020-05-12 15:17:18 Actual advanced graphics options
general 2020-05-12 15:17:38 Seriously, all I want is render distance
general 2020-05-12 15:17:44 Not shadows
general 2020-05-12 15:18:52 So when it's broken, what's gonna replace it?
general 2020-05-12 15:20:36 Same
general 2020-05-12 15:20:56 I get mouse lag beyond quality 4 because of shadows and lighting
general 2020-05-12 15:21:31 How am I supposed to fly in plane crazy if I can't see the bloody terrain from 100m up?
general 2020-05-12 15:22:21 Yes
general 2020-05-12 15:22:28 But where to make money at this point in time? Hmm?
general 2020-05-12 15:23:17 Lol it took 3 seconds for my camera to respond to mouse movement in quality 10
general 2020-05-12 15:23:44 Also I hate the idea of lowballing people with that kind of idea
general 2020-05-12 15:24:07 Roblox is a nice platform and all, but I just wish they can actually be more considerate
general 2020-05-12 15:34:46 Imagine playing hardcore mode server and someone holds your life for ransom
general 2020-05-12 15:35:32 F
general 2020-05-12 15:36:47 Cos it's a big build
general 2020-05-12 15:36:51 People tend to like big builds
general 2020-05-12 15:36:57 Regardless of detail
general 2020-05-12 15:37:26 And here I am making and carefully finetuning my microbuilds for best performance and I just get crapped on
creations-chat 2020-05-12 15:38:51 What if someone self-downvotes?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:03:14 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:03:25 My creation vanished and then the playerlist vanished
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:04:05 What pistons?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:04:54 I think roblox went out to patch a leak or something
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:09 uwot
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:37 Hold up a sec rickje I'm still updating
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:56 Starting now
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:06:05 And then I get ID-17
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:06:46 3 updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:02 Okay the creations are loaded
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:19 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:26 It has to be mid to late June
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:30:26 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:30:33 I accidentally made an X-Wing
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:34:55 Er guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:35:01 I think the save button broke
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:36:50 Most likely low effort build
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:37:19 And the creations upload requires you to take a full screenshot, not cropped
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:37:50 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:38:19 Also I'm working on a new fighter and I just realised the save button isn't working
bug-reports 2020-05-13 14:41:16 **Game breaking bug**
Non-functioning save system
My console is spamming error messages which relates to the issue regardless if I pressed save or not http://prntscr.com/sg2xhj
general 2020-05-13 14:45:13 Imagine fixing a bug only to find 3 more bugs later
general 2020-05-13 14:45:34 But in this case, roblox updated and now bugs increased tenfold
general 2020-05-13 14:46:05 We get it mate
general 2020-05-13 14:46:18 There's no need to go overboard

plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:40 Welp... there goes my work
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:44 The save system failed
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:56:24 I can load
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:57:04 My guess is that the loading system is trying to load something empty which answers back as invalid and breaks itself
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:57:49 God damn it save system... now I can't remember how I built my fighter
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:03:08 I have this annoying urge to show the chat every time it has this red marker on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:03:26 But it always annoys me when people speak in a language I can't read
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:06:49 Seriously, roblox really needs a built-in translator
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:07:58 I don't have the patience though
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:31 Jesus Christ roblox
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:51 If it keeps up, I won't be able to play roblox anymore cos it's so unoptimised
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 16:31:40 Tbf I think the roblox update negated the performance improvement update
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 16:31:56 Cos I'm now getting frame drops

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:13:02 What peeves me is that you have to make the variable-pitch propellers large because the motors can't handle the rpm
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:14:02 Well, come to think of it I think I can double-stack propellers by salvaging the technology I used for my contra-rotating turboprop engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:02:45 Is there a way to change the propeller pitch without the motors going out of sync?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:06 I mean, there's servo for that, but it limits to just 2 positions
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:33 It's for a flying aircraft carrier where weight changes are frequent
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:45 Control panel?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:07:51 What control panel?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:09:22 I don't have it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:10:31 Was it an event item cos I'm sure I obtained all the seasonal items
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:12:12 ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:09 You can ask the same question to every game
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:15 That gets updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:15 Blame roblox for negating it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:35 Which coincidentally updated the client the second the update went live
help 2020-05-17 19:16:28 I'm hearing about this so-called control panel block
help 2020-05-17 19:16:46 Where is it? I looked everywhere in my build menu and I don't have it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:48 Servo is basically motor except you're limited to a set angle it can travel to
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:59 Great for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:06 Sounds like it was deleted or made private by the owner
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:30 Anyway, what's this control panel I hear about?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:38 I don't seem to have it
general 2020-05-17 19:23:46 How come I don't have a control panel block?
general 2020-05-17 19:24:36 ...bloody hell
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:04 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:14 Actually no
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:28 I kept calling motor2 as servos
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:59 You can only swap between mouse aim mode and servo mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:27:01 What? Motor2 is capable of following the mouse when servo is unticked
general 2020-05-17 19:27:52 I had a working fully automatic autoloader :P
general 2020-05-17 19:28:14 But uh I deleted the save cos I ran out of save slots

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:31:18 I see now
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:31:34 This is something I could look into
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:32:27 I need to see how it behaves
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:33:14 Motor doesn't seem to respond
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:35:02 Are you in fullscreen?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:35:14 Cos it seem to detect mouse movement when it goes out of the window
help 2020-05-17 19:43:25 Someone made a ridiculous mistake by calling control surfaces a control panel

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:39:49 Most bombs use TNT or Amatol
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:40:39 Anyway I doubt they'd add bombshells

plane-crazy 2020-05-25 05:28:33 ...so I've made a working breech and barrel although I had to use a piston to correct the height offset by the rocket launcher so it lines up with the barrel. That's fine on paper.. Reality though is that the piston never stays in position and locked mode causes the piston head to freeze and not want to follow the bottom part

plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:15:25 How about treat 5 studs as 1m
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:16:50 In comparison, a jog/near running pace is 12 kph
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:17:56 So the speed of sound is 1234 irl
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:18:18 To put that into roblox universe, guess I divide 1234 by 4.48
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:20:40 The speed of sound irl is 20566 m/s
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:20:42 *I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:21:15 Eh I've rusted
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:21:24 It's 343 m/s according to google
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:22:52 So 16 walkspeed is 4.48 m/s but must find the value of 1 walkspeed
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:22:55 Aye
general 2020-05-25 20:23:21 So 1 walkspeed is roughly 0.28 m/s
general 2020-05-25 20:23:50 And then take the speed of sound in m/s
general 2020-05-25 20:24:03 Divide the two and should get the result
general 2020-05-25 20:24:31 And so in roblox's universe
general 2020-05-25 20:24:37 The speed of sound is 1225 walkspeed
general 2020-05-25 20:26:02 Autism made me specialise in some things at the cost of not specialising in other things

general 2020-05-25 20:36:23 Okay
general 2020-05-25 20:36:40 Which direction is the camera travelling?
general 2020-05-25 20:37:35 I have some theories
general 2020-05-25 20:41:26 If the camera is following the object's flight path from *behind*, it'll capture the movement with no problems
If the camera is *adjacent* to the object, flying parallel to the left, right, up or down, then the image will be blurry or distorted. Maybe appear to be squashed.
If the camera is *ahead* of the object, it may not be able to pick up movement as light cannot move faster than the speed it normally travels.
general 2020-05-25 20:42:15 At least that's what my brain thinks
general 2020-05-25 20:43:16 There's still resistance in space
general 2020-05-25 20:43:46 So light can't really go on forever and eventually slows down from passing through multiple rays and atoms
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:44:52 In theory for Plane Crazy, the speed of sound ingame is 1225 walkspeed
general 2020-05-25 20:47:47 Unless you're in a dive, it's difficult to fly supersonic in plane crazy with wing panels and engines

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 16:53:29 Not using conveyor drives because it's really laggy when they're not being used
general 2020-05-27 11:06:21 I want to know how do people know these claims in <#490306593242611742>, just a reality check
general 2020-05-27 11:09:57 If I'm not to get a legitimate answer within 1 hour, I will believe that the trojan claim in announcements is false
the-dump 2020-05-28 09:18:24 That shotgun would have a lot of kick
the-dump 2020-05-28 09:18:42 Better invest in a good dampening shoulder stock
general 2020-05-28 09:20:32 Ever heard of torque?
general 2020-05-28 09:20:58 This is the same problem with piston engined aircraft in the 20th century irl
general 2020-05-28 09:21:47 One way is to add an aileron trim, another way is to make contrarotating propellers
general 2020-05-28 09:23:03 Essentially, aileron trim can be used to to keep and airplane from responding to a situation where one side of an airplane is significantly heavier than the other side. Or in this case, prevent the torque from twisting the aircraft
general 2020-05-28 09:24:47 You could make a custom control surface using wing panels and a motor. The way it works that the motor is set to a very low speed for fine adjustment
general 2020-05-28 09:25:53 Quite frankly, I never used aileron trimming because I never made aircraft with a single engine
general 2020-05-28 09:29:15 The most simple contrarotating propeller engine is to have 2 motors - the rear motor is set to a max of 25 speed and built as you would with a normal prop motor. The front motor, however is attached to the front of the rear motor, spinning in the other direction at double the speed of the rear motor (max 50 speed)
general 2020-05-28 09:30:29 Because one of the propellers is facing the opposite direction
general 2020-05-28 09:30:50 So you have one pair trying to move the aircraft forwards, while the other is trying to push the aircraft back
the-dump 2020-05-28 09:32:44 So it's basically the MAG-7 except uses a belt instead of a magazine
the-dump 2020-05-28 09:33:38 Bruh just get an AA-12 or XM1011 (name might be wrong) and belt feed em
general 2020-05-28 09:34:27 I'm gonna be ingame to check the physics
general 2020-05-28 09:35:27 How significant is it?
general 2020-05-28 09:42:34 Sorry but I can't really help you with that one. Roblox's physics is just bad
general 2020-05-28 09:43:31 Although I do know that heavier aircraft tend to drift less on the horizontal axis
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:48:14 Ballast blocks are basically almost weightless at their minimal spec
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:02:39 "Fabric material has no weight"
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:03:24 Let me check here
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:03:47 
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:04:13 Yeah fabric makes normal blocks weightless apparently
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:28 That's not the case
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:37 All of the parts moved when I spawned them in
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:49 I'm definitely sure
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:06:44 Problem is that this image was made months ago and I don't have the save anymore
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:07:35 Even it struck me as odd because even when I jumped on the blocks just to be sure, they all appeared similar
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:08:11 And I never had an issue with sleeping parts once
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:10:17 But what's interesting is that I tried to give my biplane a fabric skin and the physics went haywire
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:11:15 Not only the fabric made it lighter, but it made it extremely prone to the slightest bit of general lag

the-dump 2020-07-27 20:55:49 I miss that game in roblox that simulates russian roulette
the-dump 2020-07-27 20:56:00 I think it was called One in the Chamber
the-dump 2020-07-27 20:56:43 It was pretty funny until roblox called the fun police
the-dump 2020-07-27 20:57:30 This game https://youtu.be/dWQeiiOjscM

the-dump 2020-07-27 21:05:29 I wonder if I could fire a sea urchin or stonefish
the-dump 2020-07-27 21:06:17 Imagine casually strolling around and then you get spiked by a supersonic stonefish

general 2020-08-12 22:08:57 I'm sittin here listening to Golden Wind
general 2020-08-12 22:09:11 Which makes roblox's situation a bit more ironic
general 2020-08-12 22:10:48 Your message also reminds me of that handshake in the sub scene
general 2020-08-12 22:11:36 👏 ✌️ 👌 🖐️

general 2020-09-03 07:42:10 Now I gotta climb much higher just so I don't get jumped by a phantom
general 2020-09-03 07:42:22 Ideally 12km
general 2020-09-03 07:43:47 ?
general 2020-09-03 07:44:20 Isn't that the place where everyone got meningitis some decades ago?
general 2020-09-03 07:45:05 It's easy
general 2020-09-03 07:45:21 Start a conversation with something controversial
general 2020-09-03 07:45:56 Ideally something along the lines of *Lightning is balanced*
general 2020-09-03 07:47:57 I have the ability to freeze time
general 2020-09-03 07:48:06 But only on myself
the-dump 2020-09-03 07:51:53 At least you never skip leg day
general 2020-11-28 10:38:38 I'm going to bid everybody farewell as I leave roblox indefinitely
