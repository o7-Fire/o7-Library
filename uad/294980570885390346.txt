general 2020-05-13 14:15:13 I rejoined and it works now
general 2020-05-13 14:17:58 How the hell make a Bt-7 turrot
general 2020-05-13 14:18:10 Is like just half wedge
general 2020-05-13 14:18:36 Rejoining appears to work
creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:31:32 Is not that hard
creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:32:36 The barrel can't be attached to anywhere but a spring, the spring is attached to the turret wich means since the tank and turret are heavier they wont get pushed, now that means that the spring is pushing the barrel backwards
creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:32:54 Imma try to get a screenshot
creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:34:01

creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:35:56 I was planing building a T-62 with breech shell ejecting system that launches the shell outside the turret (through that small hatch it has on the top)
creations-chat 2020-05-13 14:36:02 but

help 2020-05-27 15:27:46 Yes is an autoloader
help 2020-05-27 15:28:06 And theres 2 pistons pushing the shell up, then it gets pushed from the side into the chamber by other two pistons
help 2020-05-27 15:28:35 And lastly the spring in the barrel pushes it out with a great force, bouncing in a 45° deegre angle
help 2020-05-27 16:16:11 Working on a B-17 but idk

general 2020-06-10 13:10:39 FALLSCHIRMPANZER
general 2020-06-10 13:13:24 My tanks are oftenly like
general 2020-06-10 13:13:27 7 blocks wide
general 2020-06-10 13:13:40 So i believe using half blocks and wedge 2 should help it
general 2020-06-10 13:14:02 I once saw a guy making it 7 blocks wide and i was like
general 2020-06-10 13:14:11 *theres no middle  to put the turret*
general 2020-06-10 13:14:16 it was impair
general 2020-06-10 13:14:26 and he did an internal scream
general 2020-06-10 13:15:26 The only problem is would like to figure out os that there's wood planks that helps the tanks go from the front
general 2020-06-10 13:18:31 what
general 2020-06-10 13:18:34 ._____.
general 2020-06-10 13:18:44 why i cant make long face
general 2020-06-10 13:19:31 <@!548958475389108227> Is that for landing gear?
general 2020-06-10 13:19:56 There's many wood planes that where made
general 2020-06-10 13:20:02 that one is the
general 2020-06-10 13:20:06 me 323 gigant
general 2020-06-10 13:20:16 YYEESS
general 2020-06-10 13:20:42 we shall put wings in the ratte and drop them with the paratroopers for INFANTRY SUPPORT
general 2020-06-10 13:20:51 big german brain
general 2020-06-10 13:21:12 But wood cheap
general 2020-06-10 13:21:20 unless no foress
general 2020-06-10 13:22:29 Nice
general 2020-06-10 13:22:38 They perform great for landing with heavy aircraft
general 2020-06-10 13:22:50 I used  the same idea in my me 262
general 2020-06-10 13:22:58 Yup
general 2020-06-10 13:23:08 And also they are so insanly compact
general 2020-06-10 13:23:36 Literally can make a 8 block landing gear with like 2-3 pistons
general 2020-06-10 13:23:43 with suspension
general 2020-06-10 13:24:31 Imagine using jet enginie has a landing egar
general 2020-06-10 13:24:33 gear*
general 2020-06-10 13:24:53 *y e s*
general 2020-06-10 13:25:00 It doesnt even make sense it will just work

general 2020-06-10 13:25:15 put wheels on them
general 2020-06-10 13:25:23 and just hope they dont blow up from impact
general 2020-06-10 13:26:02 Seems legit
general 2020-06-10 13:26:25 I like when people think that ww2 engines can go super fast at full throttle
general 2020-06-10 13:26:34 even though if you do that the engines would set on fire

general 2020-06-11 22:18:25 i need
general 2020-06-11 22:18:34 to know if you can replicate something
general 2020-06-11 22:19:32 is posible to put this in a tank, cause when i did it only feed 4 rounds
general 2020-06-11 22:20:02 i did once
general 2020-06-11 22:20:10 and it almost worked properly
general 2020-06-11 22:20:27 that's the problem
general 2020-06-11 22:20:38 it has to be small of medium
general 2020-06-11 22:22:02 on of the problems is
general 2020-06-11 22:22:38 ejecting the shell off the roof of the tank
general 2020-06-11 22:52:22 Ye
general 2020-06-11 22:52:36 I actually designed something similar
general 2020-06-11 22:52:55 it was a rectangunlar box that pushed the rounds to the left and forward
general 2020-06-11 22:53:21 when it went forward it gets dragged into the breech wich would have a spring
general 2020-06-11 22:53:38 that spring would bounce it off a wedge next to the other wedge
general 2020-06-11 23:10:04 Yeah you gotta make those
general 2020-06-11 23:10:14 and then fit 2 seats
general 2020-06-11 23:10:15 for cew
general 2020-06-11 23:10:29 I forgot the leclerc one

general 2020-06-12 16:11:44 is a really fun game
general 2020-06-12 16:11:49 what i did was
general 2020-06-12 16:11:56 stack rockets and fuels each other
general 2020-06-12 16:12:09 to get a ton of speed
general 2020-06-12 16:12:24 i think i can get a picture of mine

general 2020-06-12 16:15:59 yes
general 2020-06-12 16:17:07 You basically gotta gather a ton of speed by going around earth and try to get lucky
general 2020-06-12 16:17:11 and hit the moon
general 2020-06-12 16:19:53 The thing is that
general 2020-06-12 16:20:04 if you do that tactic you could go to other planets
general 2020-06-12 16:20:09 i was really close to mars once
general 2020-06-12 16:20:52 and lastly if you go directly to the moon you might miss and lossing speed in space is really hard

creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:49:36 actually the fuselage of jets are weaker than ww2 ones
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:49:48 because they are lighter and also require better angle
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:52:01 <@!572411935669354528> is this ww2? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/719528542987354122/719530380033785906/152824755e8f16be95ff3da864a5f9de.jpg

creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:56:27 fun fact
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:56:33 i could say the future is better than modern jets

creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:56:54 because is the future
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:57:07 yeah but after 6th generation jets
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:57:37 from the perspective if you looked it has a guy in 1930 you would say bi planes bad and mono planes epic

creations-chat 2020-11-19 15:42:45 > yeah and tbh tutorials are just a cheap way of getting free builds, that doesnt help people, it takes the aspect of learning in the game and crap and then tutorial channels **(some of them like thrizet that are actually good ones that help people arent included in this)** just spam tutorials for the clout then just leave youtube, while they are still making money from little brain dead 1 year olds joining and not learning anything
<@!658318819248570381> thats pretty true and i am actually hoping the people who build my stuff learn from them because i dont wanna just build everything in existance
creations-chat 2020-11-19 15:44:21 I only made mines since i used to get my stuff copied and send to youtube without credit, i remember the guy had a foxy from fnaf shirt and stole my stuka ( and i didnt know you could blacklist and make the builds invisible at that time so big oofe)

creations-chat 2021-02-04 14:54:48 should i keep it like this lol or the thin version
creations-chat 2021-02-04 14:56:49 lets just assume is the 10.5 cm version ok

creations-chat 2021-02-04 15:07:18 I mean i could just motor lock it a half block down, the problem is that doing that will break the turret and start to wobble like some kind of spaghetti
creations-chat 2021-02-04 15:09:30 I am trying to keep it to realistic scale lmao, i already got a large version of it
creations-chat 2021-02-04 15:11:31 What? i am confused

the-dump 2021-06-29 15:04:46 yes
the-dump 2021-06-29 15:05:09 Then inside the dream i woke up in a scp looking room where i had to write with my "hands" on the walls about something and i then i woke up

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:37:20 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:37:28 i have like 2 planned
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:38:04 true but some people actually struggle to shoot them down, like the b-17 somehow takes like 600 shoots to the wing yet its still flying
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:38:12 i had that idea on my tu-95
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:38:35 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:08 Do you guys think delta wing is better for manoeuvrability in plane crazy or its all propaganda
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:18 sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:33 But then the tomcat has all of that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:39:59 i think the tomcat can be one of the most op jets to build if done properly as you can get the wing sweep of the hornet, speed of an f-15 and idk what else
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:40:49 basically delta wing if it wasn't because the elevator is sitting too low
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:41:16 yes you can?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:41:37 they are mounted in the fixed wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:41:49 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:42:08 the russians solve that issue with mounting weapons on the wings, which the weapons would rotate together
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:42:24 on the su-24
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:42:39 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:42:18 I honestly would like if plane crazy 2 was a diff game or else new users will be overwhelmed with the tools and options and possibly leave, which i did the first time i got in the game lol and then rejoined like 2 months later

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:12:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:13:44 its struggling
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:13:51 a lot of wobble

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:14:54 good
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:16:04 i am trying to
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:17:11 make ur own
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:17:13 and see
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:17:29 it flies perfectly without the plane spawning in
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:20:54 wow i clearly didnt know
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:07 you know i cant technically do that
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:12 i tried before
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:16 but this is 5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:18 and
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:21 3 blocks ofr motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:35 meaning i cant shove a delta 1x3 as i tried before
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:53 you think i didnt tried
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:21:57 theres no space for delta 1x3
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:22:52 you make it smaller then it has less surface to grip
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:22:58 meaning i cant reach the high speeds demanding
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:23:05 consider that the real thing could go like mach 5
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:23:38 https://youtu.be/xqtkJDCHJmw
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:23:51 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:24:01 i need to place motor's 2 to control the back surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:24:07 also i know the size issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:24:13 the smaller the missile the harder to control
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:24:21 thats why making a sam missile its like 10 times easier
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:25:04 did you see the build or no
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:25:15 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/884413095232028692
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:25:21 it already has those
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:25:29 and for a small surface they dont work as good
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 12:25:33 logically i tried it before

general 2021-09-08 15:29:31 helicopters are also plane technically
general 2021-09-08 15:29:40 yes really
general 2021-09-08 15:29:52 they have wings and propeller, just pointing other way
general 2021-09-08 15:30:06 there are planes which where designed to do that
general 2021-09-08 15:30:28 
general 2021-09-08 15:30:32 then whats this
general 2021-09-08 15:30:47 ok that is irrelevant for this context
general 2021-09-08 15:30:50 it was
general 2021-09-08 15:30:59 they lost like 12 pilots trying to make it work
general 2021-09-08 15:31:13 do you even read the reports
general 2021-09-08 15:31:49 
general 2021-09-08 15:31:58 what is an airplane?
general 2021-09-08 15:32:14 yes we know
general 2021-09-08 15:32:18 but they are both aircraft
general 2021-09-08 15:32:22 air craft
general 2021-09-08 15:32:26 do you not understand
general 2021-09-08 15:32:39 that is literally irrelevant for this conversation
general 2021-09-08 15:32:53 lift is a property of all aircraft
general 2021-09-08 15:33:07 bruh you are asking for specific values
general 2021-09-08 15:33:10 saying 100mph
general 2021-09-08 15:33:13 what is that for
general 2021-09-08 15:33:47 i am telling you that helis are basically planes
general 2021-09-08 15:34:09 bruh you dont call aircraft like, wow he has vtol and this one is turbo jet plane so it isnt a plane its a turbo jet plane
general 2021-09-08 15:34:17 they are inside the concept of planes
general 2021-09-08 15:34:40 ok so you are telling me that a osprey isnt a plane or a helicopter its vtol
general 2021-09-08 15:34:47 from where do you claim that
general 2021-09-08 15:34:57 BRUH
general 2021-09-08 15:35:29 Vtol is a property of an aircraft not an aircraft itself
general 2021-09-08 15:35:51 yeah but you dont remove the term of being a plane and dragging it into only vtol
general 2021-09-08 15:36:11 see
general 2021-09-08 15:36:39 yes it does
general 2021-09-08 15:36:45 do you not understand the basics of a plane
general 2021-09-08 15:36:47 
general 2021-09-08 15:37:02 bruh dont say it must be 100mph to be a plane
general 2021-09-08 15:37:19 battleship is like the smoothest brain here
general 2021-09-08 15:37:29 planes can fly slower
general 2021-09-08 15:37:38 Good
general 2021-09-08 15:37:43 He clearly doesnt even research
general 2021-09-08 15:38:10 you know how helis move forward then?
general 2021-09-08 15:38:26 They tilt the rotor ***forward***
general 2021-09-08 15:38:34 so they move ***forward***
general 2021-09-08 15:38:36 then
general 2021-09-08 15:38:55 you dont even know the concepts of planes and helis
general 2021-09-08 15:39:26 who told you that?
general 2021-09-08 15:39:35 you dont even look it up
general 2021-09-08 15:39:41 you are just assuming all <@!435946988559925248>
general 2021-09-08 15:39:54 That is literally an egocentric though
general 2021-09-08 15:40:59 helicopters have this too
general 2021-09-08 15:41:13 omg
general 2021-09-08 15:41:16 what are wings for??????
general 2021-09-08 15:41:22 do they create black magic to fly
general 2021-09-08 15:41:55 Helicopters have wings which allow to generate lift and thus go faster
general 2021-09-08 15:42:20 they dont need it due to size of the rotors dealing with most of the stress
general 2021-09-08 15:42:48 WHERE
general 2021-09-08 15:43:03 You are just putting words on my mouth that i never said
general 2021-09-08 15:43:10 
general 2021-09-08 15:43:16 YES
general 2021-09-08 15:43:31 Bruh this isnt even about the rank
general 2021-09-08 15:43:47 ah yes i can tell since you are clearly a helicopter pilot
general 2021-09-08 15:44:15 you know what let me ask my dad since he actually flown both plane and helicopter unlike you
general 2021-09-08 15:44:55 being in a helicopter or a plane doesnt mean you are flying them
general 2021-09-08 15:45:40 he was
general 2021-09-08 15:46:11 He flew, hueys, mirage, A-37, T-37
general 2021-09-08 15:46:17 and other trainers
general 2021-09-08 15:46:59 bruh wdym only trainers
general 2021-09-08 15:47:07 i literally put the T-37 and A-37
general 2021-09-08 15:47:22 literally T stands for trainer and A for combat variants
general 2021-09-08 15:47:33 holy crap
general 2021-09-08 15:49:25 <@!435946988559925248> Until he comes back i say we both stay within our different perception of the concepts
general 2021-09-08 15:49:49 Not really
general 2021-09-08 15:50:59 <@!280020722431295488> can you get vtol rank with a heli considering that is able to fullfil the requirements, since idk how you got yours
general 2021-09-08 15:51:35 Do it
general 2021-09-08 15:52:03 i agree
general 2021-09-08 15:52:35 Why should i
general 2021-09-08 15:52:46 Not really
general 2021-09-08 15:54:53 <@!447221768520859659> also it never specifies a plane
general 2021-09-08 15:55:05 Anything within Vtol
general 2021-09-08 15:55:09 should work
general 2021-09-08 15:55:16 yes
general 2021-09-08 15:55:23 because it would have the vtol ability
general 2021-09-08 15:56:26 Vtol is basically vertical take off which is what helicopters do
general 2021-09-08 15:56:59 They carry a grenade launcher
general 2021-09-08 15:58:09 https://youtu.be/zygf16fBMmg 4:09
general 2021-09-08 15:59:11 if it moves horizontally
general 2021-09-08 15:59:18 at any speed
general 2021-09-08 15:59:25 that means is flying horizontally
general 2021-09-08 15:59:38 theres never an specification of the speed
general 2021-09-08 16:04:08 you
general 2021-09-08 16:54:33 epic

plane-crazy 2021-09-09 17:33:15 soviet f-15
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 17:41:46 its an airbrake

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:57:22 that makes it worse
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 01:57:51 it generates more drag than control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:00:54 you are slowing yourself vertically harder than with the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:01:45 LMAO
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:02:37 you just stated
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:27 bruh it causes more drag
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:36 you dont even need motor surfaces for the main wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:04:43 when the roll is caused by the elevators
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:05:22 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:08 do you even know that most fighter jets use tailerons?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:06:43 ok i won then
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:07 motor surfaces on the main wings as ailerons cause more drag than using control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:12 nobody cares
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:20 you almost sound like an unde
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:07:48

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:08 he tries to prove a point but doesnt have actual values to prove
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:31 so he doesnt even know what he is talking about if he hasnt tested any of that to win the argument
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 02:08:47 then he is being egocentric as he just claims anyone is bad who doesnt use his methods

plane-crazy 2021-09-21 15:42:52 
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 15:43:54 on this angle it looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 15:50:31

plane-crazy 2021-09-21 15:51:01 WHAT
general 2021-09-21 16:55:55 il-28 is like designed so your bases get stolen
general 2021-09-22 00:06:32 lmao
general 2021-09-22 00:07:01 mad cuz bad
general 2021-09-22 00:07:53 i am pretty sure you have to record it all for the rank tho
general 2021-09-22 00:08:02 so you show it is whitin the specifics
general 2021-09-22 00:08:23 i always record it for all ranks
general 2021-09-22 00:09:49 thats an uboot with an f-22 on top
general 2021-09-22 00:10:27 i like how the game lags more using 5 wing pannels than making the entire planet with over 500k blocks
general 2021-09-22 00:10:43 sorry a super pershing
general 2021-09-22 00:11:16 ok its time to make a mini bismark and call it scaled
general 2021-09-22 00:11:27 but every single block is a custom angle
general 2021-09-22 00:12:54 i mean he is speaking facts
general 2021-09-22 00:18:13 the unde
general 2021-09-22 00:20:25 good now i have to blind myself

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:38:32 make it self guided
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:39:01 this gives me mig-29 vibes
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:41:06 this is painful to look at
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:41:34 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:43:18 kinda sus
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:44:20 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:44:25 f-4 competitor
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:44:36 <@!739369649971527720> you know how this thing existed
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:44:44 well
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:44:58 NO
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:45:53 it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:48:21 mig-37 what
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:53:29 those engines tho...
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:53:37 its not
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:54:06 to build right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:54:19 WHAT
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:54:25 its not
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:54:33 they are big
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:55:06 https://youtu.be/WM6BxTxzoPI
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:55:16 dont tell him
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:55:48 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:56:14 they are huge
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:56:22 how do you think they eat so much fuel
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:56:53 scaled next to a person
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:57:20 how so
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:57:48 but the su-75 isnt meant to fight the f-22
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:58:04 its mostly agaisnt mig-29's and f-16, f-15's etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:58:06 even the gripen
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:58:47 yeah but they use diff engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:58:54 russian engines are a lot rougher
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:59:36 yeah but they wouldnt send a single one against an s-500
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 14:59:56 then you wouldnt have it operating as often you would like
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:00:01 no?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:00:30 i think you arent considering the doctrine of aircraft that would be applied to counter those systems
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:00:46 like they would prob send a ton of kamikaze uav's like how they killed tanks before
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:01:38 anti-missiles have a limited capacity to destroy multiple targets so if they send multiple cruise missiles at some point one would get through
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:01:58 its similar to what happens in naval doctrines
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:02:09 ships have anti missile systems
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:02:21 motorlock them
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:02:37 yeah and they wont launch a single missile that would obviously get countered
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:03:02 up to you
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:03:13 by the anti missile system?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:04:15 https://youtu.be/JB56n7NxpOU?t=1189 19:49 just to give you an idea, ik this isnt real life but the best sim explanation i could find
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:04:52 yes they track it with radars, the patriot uses like a million diff systems
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:05:00 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:05:15 not really
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:05:41 first the plane needs to maintain lock and requires a good missile like a phoenix to get it
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:05:58 as what they carry are often for air to air combat
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:06:41 because they are there that doesnt meant a missile will get through
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:06:54 some missiles dont do the dumb and go in a straight line into their target
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:07:15 they do have counter measures agaisnt CIWS for example some maneuver in zig-zag
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:07:57 that is literally the iron dome
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:08:58 that place is literally filled with radars, ciws and specialised missiles which are firing at a bunch of old rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:09:12 its too specific of an scenario to compare it with russian S-500
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:09:43 dont change the context of now "it still works"
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:10:08 we are talking that they dont have a 100% efficiency and will always be able to shoot down every target
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:10:21 have you seen actual footage of a missile getting through then
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:11:17 now because youtube doesnt allow those videos i will have to send another sim
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:11:35 logically they wouldnt allow it as they did in vietnam with the soldiers that were lost
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:11:39 it would get censored
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:12:18 then where do you want me to find highly censored footage that isnt allowed in most sites of hte internet
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:12:39 like which????
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:14:04 
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:14:15 see they dont always shoot all the missiles and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:14:22 find it yourself cause i wont
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:14:41 https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/iron-dome-missile-defense-israel.html
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:14:41 then you are the one living the fantasy
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:15:32 even they claim that dont shoot down 100% of the stuff they intercept yet you seem biased because the systems look advanced enough to do everything at full potential
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:17:02 lmao we all know missiles are more expensive that rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:17:07 thats mostly why they get through
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:17:44 the israel defence minister (i think) stated that was the main issue of sustaining the iron dome
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:18:23 if you arent able to keep up the iron dome mainentance  then theres no missiles to fire and rockets will get throug
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:18:46 because people try to be smart about their equipment instead of collapsing their economy buying more stuff they will even use
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:19:30 you seem pretty ignorant
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:19:59 i am being realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:21:42 you claim things without researching, for example you said the s-500 would shoot an f-22 easy even though both are classified, then the iron dome shoots down everything because YOU stated that and that doesnt mean its true. even israeli defence minister knows that it doesnt shoot down everything though its highly effective
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:22:13 also you seem very demanding for the information that you ask me yet you dont research anything by yourself but hit with subjectivism again
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:22:45 and i explained the reasons, i claimed that they arent realistic but its the closest thing i could give, and you took that as realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:22:52 ikr he is doing that rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:23:48 
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:23:51 i am not
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:24:21 we cant send it here because it would count as political and mods dont like political
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:25:05 You claimed how good missiles system are during the whole conversation logically we can all infer that, thats the point you were searching
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:25:21 i mean from all this conversation you havent brought anything more valid
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:25:48 Good then you can actually speak facts instead of what you want
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:26:08 see to win this argument you are focusing ONLY on the sim even though i spoke about other things
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:26:24 is "fantasies" the only thing you know to say?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:27:10 watching youtube videos of iron dome shooting down rockets isnt a valid argumment if you dont even know the systems being used
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:27:28 atleast i dont repeat the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:27:41 you were asking for a video before to it can be "valid"
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:27:54 See you are doing it again
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:28:11 And you lost the point of the conversation
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:28:38 If you try to keep it into a bubble tbh i dont see much point of repeating the same facts i been giving over and over
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:28:47 you didn't even have a solid point
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:28:50 from the start
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:29:43 Yes i have it and gave it multiple times, its not my issue that you are just rejecting it
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:30:27 Again read your own messages to remind yourself of the context
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:30:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:30:56 move to the <#495286269459300364>

the-dump 2021-09-23 15:31:30 i told him
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 15:31:46 and you want to annoy people in general?
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:32:04 good idea
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:32:43 tbh theres no point talking with him as he doesnt even reseach and when he looses he bring back a point that i already clarified like 20 times
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:33:45 to be honest you dont seem that mature to take a decent converstion without being an hypocrit
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:34:03 hypocrit again
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:34:16 and again
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:35:17 This is what i mean, every time i get into a conversation with him he gets mad and goes back with his mr.angry vocabulary of "noob, cry harder, childish, fantasies, inmature, etc"
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:35:23 as i been trying to be rational
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:35:29 hi gamma
the-dump 2021-09-23 15:35:42 ok bye

general 2021-09-23 15:58:32 again?
general 2021-09-23 15:59:14 you never vc every time we host an event where you must
general 2021-09-23 16:01:37 you said your mic was working the last time
general 2021-09-23 16:01:44 you joined and said you would speak this time
general 2021-09-23 16:01:46 bruh

general 2021-09-23 16:04:05 nobody lives forever so what would you loose
general 2021-09-23 16:04:17 well its up to you
general 2021-09-23 16:04:39 its not like we can force but if you promise to join and use mic for a collab then you kinda gotta do it
general 2021-09-23 16:05:00 last time rodusk got dissapointed when i was the only one speaking with my friend and we had other 3 yt's that never spoke
general 2021-09-23 16:06:08 yes
general 2021-09-23 16:06:45 Probably?
general 2021-09-23 16:12:47 i got this one which has electric recoil
general 2021-09-23 16:13:00 also in evike theres an AK grenade launcher you can attach below
general 2021-09-23 16:13:35 some have a small lever that apply preasure
general 2021-09-23 16:13:44 which is kinda how install my optics
general 2021-09-23 16:13:57 
general 2021-09-23 16:14:06 you got a damn rail
general 2021-09-23 16:14:07 lmao
general 2021-09-23 16:14:14 that makes it 20 times easier
general 2021-09-23 16:14:19 wait show
general 2021-09-23 16:14:31 the issue with the optics mounting device its that its quite heavy
general 2021-09-23 16:14:46 this
general 2021-09-23 16:16:06 ohhhh
general 2021-09-23 16:16:07 that
general 2021-09-23 16:16:34 you see this small rod? its pushed back since its spring loaded and you roll the mussle out like a supressor
general 2021-09-23 16:16:48 since it has strings
general 2021-09-23 16:17:44 tbh i would rather had the Ak-74s
general 2021-09-23 16:18:05 wait no i mean ak-74u
general 2021-09-23 16:18:19 this thing is so short lmao
general 2021-09-23 16:18:31 you better hope the gearbox doesnt break
general 2021-09-23 16:19:10 now planning to get this
general 2021-09-23 16:19:39 one of the places we go play airsoft has trenches so it should work grea there
general 2021-09-23 16:19:44 theres one for around 499
general 2021-09-23 16:19:50 but needs to restock
general 2021-09-23 16:21:24 
general 2021-09-23 16:22:02 i was once gonna get a beretta but i though about getting the ww2 version instead which is out of stock
general 2021-09-23 16:22:13 close to a beretta
general 2021-09-23 16:22:30 also lighter barrel which is realy nice for handling
general 2021-09-23 16:22:42 i do have a luger
general 2021-09-23 16:22:44 with a drum mag
general 2021-09-23 16:22:52 but it just eats a ton of  gas
general 2021-09-23 16:22:53 gas
general 2021-09-23 16:23:16 the other one i got is a makarov and a modernized cz-75

general 2021-09-23 16:24:03 though with the orange mussle
general 2021-09-23 16:24:21 i wanted to get one of those so badly
general 2021-09-23 16:25:06 i had to pic between pp-bizon (somenome showed it to me in a game and it just carries a heck ton of ammo) or the as-val but i didnt get them in time
general 2021-09-23 16:25:34 ikr its basically a mini ak
general 2021-09-23 16:25:40 but we got a p-90 instead
general 2021-09-23 16:25:44 which is kinda bad
general 2021-09-23 16:25:52 carries like no ammo and breaks my wrist
general 2021-09-23 16:26:01 not as comfortable to handle as i though for a long time
general 2021-09-23 16:26:44 oh yeah this is the smallest electric gun i got
general 2021-09-23 16:26:52 i got 2 drums with it so it plays as a support
general 2021-09-23 16:27:18 this one looks good
general 2021-09-23 16:27:27 for CQB
general 2021-09-23 16:28:34 Ok which one is better, AUG or FAMAS
general 2021-09-23 16:28:38 for airsoft

general 2021-09-23 16:30:20 he posted nsfw
general 2021-09-23 16:31:56 i heard that one of the issues of trying to use the as-val as a sniper is that it doesnt perform as good
general 2021-09-23 16:32:16 excuses
general 2021-09-23 16:32:20 airsoft
general 2021-09-23 16:32:42 i had some issues with my mosin where some rounds would fire better depending on the magazine
general 2021-09-23 16:33:08 irl the as-val ammo was so deadly that it was banned to being sold or something
general 2021-09-23 16:33:22 how
general 2021-09-23 16:33:26 ik thats why
general 2021-09-23 16:34:14 i really wanted to modify my ak-74m into something like what the spetnaz carries
general 2021-09-23 16:34:26 prob very heavy
general 2021-09-23 16:35:35 and doesnt slide off or is too large
general 2021-09-23 16:35:35 the main issue is finding a working top cover that fits properly

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:52:42 just you
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:22:05 i am getting close to finishing my f-14 project that has been going for so many months
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:23:07 probably a D variant but no idea
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:23:41 use signs because if you use texts they will glitch and sometimes turn invisible
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:23:46 disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:24:20 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:24:33 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:24:41 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:24:45 thx
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:25:01 did you know that not all f-14's noses are the same
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:25:30 not really
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:25:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:25:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:26:07 i wouldnt bother piston locking it since its 2.1k blocks already
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:26:15 why would i bother lagging it even more
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:26:23 and yes i tried double control surfaces design and was ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:26:43 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/879747225012547644/903407137831665744/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:27:20 if i bring that higher up then it will block the piston that helps me jumping out of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:27:29 be more specific
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:28:18 both
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:28:25 but i also want to run it

general 2021-11-02 02:49:38 not really just ingame
general 2021-11-02 14:03:32 i have an extreme suspicion that berilaco is an alt of k1mon
general 2021-11-02 14:05:05 bruh he is defending k1mon for not copying my tomcat and taking him 10 weeks to build it
general 2021-11-02 14:05:14 and instantly has i am winning he appears on the phone
general 2021-11-02 14:05:24 also look at k1mon and berilaco messages
general 2021-11-02 14:05:30 they are barely active in any server
general 2021-11-02 14:08:02 this is the stupidest lie ever
general 2021-11-02 14:09:38 wdym
general 2021-11-02 14:10:25 no idea then
general 2021-11-02 14:11:19 he said that he managed to copy it being on my personal private server that no one has access to
general 2021-11-02 14:11:32 and i am like bruh do you think i was born yesterday
general 2021-11-02 14:13:15 bruh he used exploits to take my tomcat
general 2021-11-02 14:13:51 no
general 2021-11-02 14:18:26 Berilaco is an alt of k1mon be aware if you see his alt join any servers he will use exploits to steal builds
general 2021-11-02 14:18:41 this bastard got into my server stole my tomcat and ran away
general 2021-11-02 14:18:50 then how does he have my updated tomcat
general 2021-11-02 14:19:19 he thinks i am stupid
general 2021-11-02 14:19:47 well for you to know he has an updated version of that
general 2021-11-02 14:19:50 which i never showed up
general 2021-11-02 14:20:10 i have been building it in my private server (personal one) and he somehow has it
general 2021-11-02 14:20:40 its in my discord
general 2021-11-02 14:21:03 my account has the max security so its imposible he could have gotten in
general 2021-11-02 14:21:07 no notifications
general 2021-11-02 14:21:14 and he is logically a child
general 2021-11-02 14:22:15 but they never took my accounts
general 2021-11-02 14:22:20 because i didnt save passwords
general 2021-11-02 14:23:09 no and logical that he has the copy script
general 2021-11-02 14:23:23 not only that but he ran away
general 2021-11-02 14:23:26 out of the server
general 2021-11-02 14:23:34 and as soon that happened barilaco started defending him
general 2021-11-02 14:23:57 i did
general 2021-11-02 14:26:18 lmao that grammar
general 2021-11-02 14:35:27 not my roblox
general 2021-11-02 14:37:16 ok but they look both extremely sus
general 2021-11-02 14:37:32 like as soon i talked to him then k1mon instantly left my roblox server
general 2021-11-02 14:38:49 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/905093936505307156/905096943640936448/unknown.png
general 2021-11-02 14:38:59 and when i looked before talking to him he was on my server
general 2021-11-02 14:39:04 probably using the priv link
general 2021-11-02 23:10:23 cringe

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:04:24 its hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:04:46 mostly because these control surfaces overlap on top
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:04:49 and mess up the design
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:05:24 no i use control surfaces for the blakc trails

plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:08:36 A
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:08:38 probably
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:09:12 the entire reason i have this pfp is because i hate furries
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:09:18 hate the furry culture not you
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:09:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:09:39 its real chonky now
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:09:45 because f-14 is origininally chonky

plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:12:52 depends

plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:14:36 nope
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:14:41 it was a miss perspective
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:14:47 its just that the engines are angled
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:14:56 
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:15:15 which means if you put the engines angled horizontally the nose looks angled
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:15:26 but originally isnt
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:15:38 true
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:15:59 its something that bothers me a lot each time i had to spawn my old tomcat

creations-chat 2021-12-26 03:39:07 couldnt you find a way to hide the seat cause in my opinion it does more damage to the looks of the plane than the rest, also the motorlocks and the awkward cut which i mean you could piston lock it. though i personally dont like mini planes that much with those few things out of the way i would think its nice

plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:02:04 i know unless its it requires pistonlocking which is annoying

plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:02:51 i mean for the stabilizers for example
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:04:00 its the third tomcat
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:04:10 basically like the first one but with components of the second one
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:04:19 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:04:24 worries me that it glitches out
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:04:43 and disappears at a certain distance
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:06:44 my biggest worry is making this
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:06:52 cause its pretty difficult
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:06:57 and annoying
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:13:39 for scale context
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:14:08 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:14:26 https://youtu.be/FKP9SI_D1lM i remember
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:14:35 those engines sure were ugly
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:14:55 WHAT
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:15:12 i know that i atleast did a good job in the landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:15:15 lo
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:15:40 i remember having to find a way to fit this gear within the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:15:42 it was neat
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:16:14 you could just make sure to place the motorlock somewhere not annoying if you are using
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:21:14 long gone
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:21:18 more like Horten 18
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 21:23:24

plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:01:57 i am aware it wont fully fit perfectly over a blueprint just whatever i get to look the best it good enough for me <@!345527706340818944>
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:03:06 aside from the decal and the motor looks really good in the under belly
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:03:23

plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:04:12 one sec
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:04:53 they had to be longer so thats why the exposed motorlock on the right
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:05:00 i had to lower it half a block
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:05:20 
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:05:26 better than having them exposed
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:06:18 yeah i am aware of the frontal nose gear
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:06:46 but like rn
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:06:54 the elevators turns into spaghetti at some speeds
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:07:00 no idea how to really fix that
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:07:53 around 600 it happens
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:09:36 thrust vectoring maybe idk
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:57:04 <@!345527706340818944> so

plane-crazy 2022-02-03 04:47:12 or
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 04:47:29 i found like 60 images like this
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 04:47:45 
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 04:47:56 this one?
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 18:58:03 kinda like k1lmon when he was on this discord and posted my tomcat
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 19:00:11 tell him to watch is tone
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:17:40 question which fixed wing should i use, (first one being larger than the second one, also the wings are moved slightly forward)
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:18:06 first or second one
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:19:09 ok but
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:19:22 consider where it starts
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:19:38 and this is pretty hard to move around
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:20:05 
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:20:08 ok now again
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:20:13 you said the second one twice
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:20:52 ok main issue i find with the second one is that the wings feel too far back
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:22:31 first one again
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:22:45 
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:29:01 <@456226577798135808><@!619312093962829849> <@!683847069890510887> ok so here is why i think i am keeping the first one rather than the second one
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:29:26 i do find something odd about the first one but the second one just feels like too skinny for me
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 20:52:22 ok gotta fix more stuff bruh

plane-crazy 2022-02-04 19:29:00 and he played only 6 games on the abrams
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 19:29:09 from the 12k games he played
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 19:29:49 definition of dementia
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:40:25 it has a bit
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:40:33 its missing the fuel tanks, decals, small details
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:40:38 few things to fix around
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:40:48 but i am pretty happy with it so far
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:41:14 after the things i just said get implemented i will attempt
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:46:17 imposible
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:46:31 i could though the motorlock would break the wing swing
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:47:09 i know how
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:47:30 just motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:50:22 yes ik how to
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:50:39 theres two ways
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:51:08 you can either duplicate the layer of wing and hope they fill the gaps in
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:51:14 or use a motorlock tower in a motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:54:20 i didnt want to leak this idea but here it is
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:54:33 it is kinda obvious
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:54:49 havent seen anyone use it
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:55:00 this is just the simplified context
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:55:20 you can just put more motors 2
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:29 arent you using delta wings
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:45 for camouflage
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:56 then use
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:05:10 add more thrust then

creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:03:17 WHAT
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 14:08:45 and then what

plane-crazy 2022-03-18 17:27:09 where
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:02:37 could be better
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:03:35 decrease the back custom angle and make the tip of the wing a bit rounder
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:03:43 you can do this with delta control surface 1x2

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:21:36 like the one of the f-117
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:22:07 man its a pain
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:22:16 i can tell from the time i built a su-75
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:22:22 you will mostly rely on propellers
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:23:22 but man it was good at striking targets
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:23:30 atleast back in dessert storm
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:23:44 doing 5% of the sorties and hitting 40% of the total targets
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:24:35 basically my fanbase
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:24:44 turning the SR-71 into a hercules
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:25:19 i agree
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:25:22 strike sr-71

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:25:46 what an unit
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:26:06 he is probably an inch away from becoming the seat
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:26:37 due to how fast would it be going i cant imagine firing that reliably

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:29:39 mig-31 competitor
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:31:30 soviet competitor of the f-117 i think
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:32:21 
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:33:05 i hate the fact that it looks something that could have been built to compete agains the f-117 which was already built by a soviet physicists
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:33:38 wow
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 01:34:39 probably i will make the rafale as theres already too many eurofighters out there

general 2022-04-24 17:50:17 Me 262 thrust sucks, turn rate sucks too. But decent guns
general 2022-04-24 17:50:43 Yeah but better than 50 cals
general 2022-04-24 17:50:49 If you gonna shred
general 2022-04-24 17:50:59 It is
general 2022-04-24 17:51:35 900
general 2022-04-24 17:52:06 Already got all the me-262's
general 2022-04-24 17:52:31 Hi
general 2022-04-24 17:52:43 You were the guy that
general 2022-04-24 17:52:51 Amazing plane
general 2022-04-24 17:53:08 Its not
general 2022-04-24 17:53:22 Actually i been using and it has shockingly good
general 2022-04-24 17:53:28 The la 200
general 2022-04-24 17:53:49 La 200 also turns surprinsingly well
general 2022-04-24 17:54:04 Hello
general 2022-04-24 17:54:11 Brb
general 2022-04-24 17:56:11 la-200 beats mostly everything at its br
general 2022-04-24 17:56:20 mig-15 though amazing it isnt as competitive as before
general 2022-04-24 17:56:27 do a backflip
general 2022-04-24 17:56:36 not that bad
general 2022-04-24 17:56:49 just a bit of training and really easily you can get them onto target
general 2022-04-24 17:56:57 and man do those gun shred
general 2022-04-24 17:57:00 also la-200 has a radar
general 2022-04-24 17:57:09 it can at proper speeds
general 2022-04-24 17:57:35 compared to most jets at its br has really good sustained turn rate, meaning you can make them fall out of the sky compared to other aircraft
general 2022-04-24 17:57:43 two engines
general 2022-04-24 17:58:06 they would mostly break their wings
general 2022-04-24 17:58:12 cause that thing is surely super fast
general 2022-04-24 17:58:23 and turning at those speeds the wings just snap off
general 2022-04-24 17:58:50 <@315262125113081856> you can pretty much outturn a p-51 on a mig-15
general 2022-04-24 17:59:13 i got the german sabre
general 2022-04-24 17:59:16 surprisingly bad
general 2022-04-24 17:59:21 mostly works at cas
general 2022-04-24 17:59:33 i got a bit of every other nation
general 2022-04-24 17:59:41 i dont fully rush a tech tree and die
general 2022-04-24 17:59:51 i play a bit of every nation to keep up
general 2022-04-24 17:59:57 yes
general 2022-04-24 18:00:04 exactly
general 2022-04-24 18:00:23 i am not gonna kill myself grinding all the other top tiers if i dont enjoy it at the moment
general 2022-04-24 18:00:31 even more that i been busy these days
general 2022-04-24 18:00:36 he said
general 2022-04-24 18:00:39 WHAT
general 2022-04-24 18:00:52 top tier sucks on most matches
general 2022-04-24 18:01:04 ground is full of ka-50's killing everything
general 2022-04-24 18:01:12 air either has a ton of f-4's or mig-23's
general 2022-04-24 18:01:36 i mostly enjoy grabbing the brummbar and trying to use it as an artillery piece at top tier
general 2022-04-24 18:01:56 i killed a centurion once from 600 meters through the roof
general 2022-04-24 18:02:02 i do have it
general 2022-04-24 18:02:08 here
general 2022-04-24 18:02:25 }
general 2022-04-24 18:03:00 i really just grinded the vehicles that i liked by design
general 2022-04-24 18:03:07 many german players are just braindead
general 2022-04-24 18:03:14 like complaining the tiger 1 doesnt have 300mm of frontal armor
general 2022-04-24 18:03:24 or that the 88 is underperforming
general 2022-04-24 18:03:48 boats are now practically being gifted at this point
general 2022-04-24 18:04:01 i love the T-44
general 2022-04-24 18:04:08 god SL making vehicle
general 2022-04-24 18:04:31 i like the p-51 as the bubble canopy but overall doesnt feel as competitive
general 2022-04-24 18:04:48 
general 2022-04-24 18:05:09 yeah but you actually gotta put a hell ton of effort compared to the spitfires and bf-109's
general 2022-04-24 18:06:09 they climb too well
general 2022-04-24 18:06:17 like the second best climber in-game
general 2022-04-24 18:07:26 i used to try playing with the mustang a lot
general 2022-04-24 18:07:34 but either had really bad games
general 2022-04-24 18:07:38 or simply no
general 2022-04-24 18:07:43 no
general 2022-04-24 18:08:13 if i havent played that many games then why i got most of them spaded?
general 2022-04-24 18:08:30 do a backflip
general 2022-04-24 18:09:05 then gaijin being broken

plane-crazy 2022-05-14 22:44:56 I just want to give them a base to work with, post a neat showcase of the build but my own version and since they can only get it is by them improving at such level they are forced to learn anf get better or do nothing

general 2022-05-26 16:13:24 might be stupidly overpowered
general 2022-05-26 16:13:45 early f-14's easily beat the early f-15's and f-16's because AIM-54
general 2022-05-26 16:14:04 at best the f-15's and f-16's had like sparrows and sidewinders
general 2022-05-26 16:14:58 idk up for them, its just too good
general 2022-05-26 16:17:08 i havent even watched the first one

general 2022-05-26 16:20:06 f-14 will out-turn and out-range everything
general 2022-05-26 16:20:47 mig-25 to have chance of somewhat bvr against the f-14
general 2022-05-26 16:21:12 but thats what the AIM-54 does
general 2022-05-26 16:21:57 meanwhile germany with an F-4 that doesnt even have sparrows or amraams
general 2022-05-26 16:22:15 the mig-23
general 2022-05-26 16:23:03

general 2022-05-26 16:23:50 must have something to counter it
general 2022-05-26 16:24:16 like 90% of the people at top tier dont know how to notch a missile
general 2022-05-26 16:24:48 i hope f-14 players dont know how to use the aim-54 as you got to climb for it to be fast
general 2022-05-26 16:24:53 or else is slow as a rock

plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:45:21 i like how some people call me the best builder of plane crazy until i send people making things like this https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneCrazyCommunity/comments/vfauh0/new_wip_tomcat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:49:44 its not that hard, you have an entire section of a tower of locks for the top cockpit which tilts entirely, the other is just piston spam and angles
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:50:07 i get it how its done but i personally never built it like that or else pc dies
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:50:26 i done interiors before but again same deal

plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:55:48 
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:56:01 he tried to do a top custom angle
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 16:56:09 good concept but needs polishment
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 17:48:34 he's in my server btw

creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:56:28 sadly no because it has a really sharp nose from top down. <@491272361589342208> well if you want an answer, again i am not, i dislike the anthropomorphic culture of people adding human hair, eyes or whatever to animals
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:58:40 if you are really going to go this way then you should fix your mirage, yours is too short, wings are skinny too and proportions are falling off slightly
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:00:42 if you are willing to talk about this then head to the general, this is to discuss about builds, also you been claiming i am for over a year probably, if you wanna talk about it so badly then why is that lmao

plane-crazy 2022-08-02 15:42:15 Fly-by-wire is a digital control of the aircraft. Used in modern planes, some planes got legacy controls too, older planes that used this were mig 21's, f-15 me-262 etc
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 15:42:54 When you disable it the plane no longer is being automatically corrected to fly properly but you can do crazy stuff

general 2022-08-10 01:28:01 exactly
general 2022-08-10 01:28:18 imagine shooting at the headon
general 2022-08-10 01:29:06 calls me bad. also you
general 2022-08-10 01:29:45 brb
general 2022-08-10 04:41:35 its interesting, f-16 will probs have aim-9l's and sparrows maybe, but i think the mig-29 would get the r-27
general 2022-08-10 04:42:32 its actually worse on turning than the mig-29, but carries more missiles
general 2022-08-10 04:43:06 exactly
general 2022-08-10 04:43:12 thats basically what all russians do
general 2022-08-10 04:43:16 first turn and boom
general 2022-08-10 04:43:17 like a mirage
general 2022-08-10 04:43:27 
general 2022-08-10 04:43:34 
general 2022-08-10 04:44:22 
general 2022-08-10 04:44:44 f-16a its actually better at turning than the c variant, just poop radar
general 2022-08-10 04:45:28 we still need the frogfoot
general 2022-08-10 04:45:41 i think they could add the mirage 2000
general 2022-08-10 04:46:06 faster than that
general 2022-08-10 04:46:11 but not of much use
general 2022-08-10 04:46:17 i bet it will turn into a squad vehicle
general 2022-08-10 04:46:30 laser bombs
general 2022-08-10 04:47:13 they add things depending on demand
general 2022-08-10 04:47:17 or else game dies

creations-chat 2022-09-20 21:56:40 <@706717603258957864> he is making the newer F-15, it has these different nozzle. but the 3D model he is using its the older F-15 with different ones
creations-chat 2022-09-20 21:58:44 you suggest things to improve the build when in practice we, the people making that already are aware of it and it simply looks horrible
creations-chat 2022-09-20 22:01:04 thats the F-15C, like one of the earliest F-15's. you may be thinking of the F-15SE which is a stealth f-15 project that got cancelled or something

general 2022-09-25 02:23:16 i am gonna play like 3 more games and go
general 2022-09-25 02:25:21 a year ago people though i was a woman
general 2022-09-25 02:26:53 idk but was just weird
general 2022-09-25 02:27:18 people would say he does he/she like to build "something bomber"?
general 2022-09-25 02:27:22 and then walk up to me
general 2022-09-25 02:27:32 and then say hey idk are you male or female
general 2022-09-25 02:27:34 and i was like bruh
general 2022-09-25 02:28:28 i mean no one is born a god builder
general 2022-09-25 02:28:41 good for you
general 2022-09-25 02:30:04 he has to write letter by letter
general 2022-09-25 02:32:22 soon
general 2022-09-25 02:32:47 literally the plane known by like almost no one
general 2022-09-25 02:38:23 lots of people know the ka-50
general 2022-09-25 02:46:00 its the fact i could name you helis you dont even know
general 2022-09-25 02:46:21 
general 2022-09-25 02:47:06 they dont have the budget of the US so what what did you expect
general 2022-09-25 02:48:02 i mean it worked with the mig-25
general 2022-09-25 02:49:16 these days the west isnt that insane
general 2022-09-25 02:49:56 the abrams is hell out of an expensive tank to maintain, then you have the leclerc which got its expensive systems and the germans still missing parts for their eurofighters and leopards
general 2022-09-25 02:50:55 <@287454032250011649> if you consider what they made was meant for offensive warfare, which in those terms you need a lot of equipment and you would have lost lots of equipment i dont see them with much of a choice
general 2022-09-25 02:51:16 its just that today's equipment isnt up for the cheap advanced antitank guns you can get
general 2022-09-25 02:51:35 ka-50?
general 2022-09-25 02:52:30 awacs are very expensive to maintain, just imagine the ammount of electric components that are constantly melting as you are scanning hundreds of kilometers
general 2022-09-25 02:52:43 and its not like you got lots of electronics these days
general 2022-09-25 02:52:55 its what the russians lack the most
general 2022-09-25 02:53:00 ironically the chinese got a hell ton of
general 2022-09-25 02:53:12 the Tu-156?
general 2022-09-25 02:53:58 because its expensive, you already got a working plane so just use that. making a newer one takes lots of money, testing, etc etc
general 2022-09-25 02:54:08 then after its in service you got to polish it for more years
general 2022-09-25 02:54:18 and just puts more stress on the production chain
general 2022-09-25 02:54:59 thank you
general 2022-09-25 02:55:42 <@1004207882784489472> if you think about its like an armata
general 2022-09-25 02:55:45 looks cool and modern
general 2022-09-25 02:55:52 and burns money
general 2022-09-25 02:57:24 ik but so do their other bombers
general 2022-09-25 02:57:55 you got lots of them, then really atleast its a bit cheaper considering you can use the parts of decommissioned ones
general 2022-09-25 02:58:11 get on ravenfield
general 2022-09-25 02:58:34 make a priv game
general 2022-09-25 02:59:41 but my tu-22 can eject downwards
general 2022-09-25 03:00:27 isnt that the tiger tank mod that you can easily kill with small arms

general 2023-01-27 00:18:59 STOP CHANGED BAD
general 2023-01-27 00:19:13 do not look it up
general 2023-01-27 02:29:09 BRUH
general 2023-01-27 02:30:36 half of my team are subsonic
general 2023-01-27 02:31:21 fun fact, wonder the plane i am playing and what sidewinder i am using
general 2023-01-27 02:32:07 so
general 2023-01-27 02:32:31 rear aspect btw
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 01:39:09 my jet is "aight"
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 01:40:00 thx i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 01:40:06 i mean this thing is like a year old build
general 2023-01-28 20:49:30 monthly battlepass
general 2023-01-28 22:45:56 smaller chassis = lighter and less places to put armor
general 2023-01-28 22:46:15 you can put a lot more armor in a smaller frontal plate than a larger one
general 2023-01-28 22:55:34 why is that
general 2023-01-28 23:06:21 got no money for better ones
general 2023-01-28 23:06:42 and the ones such as the armata series seem expensive
general 2023-01-28 23:14:39 but to be fair any tank can now be easily destroyed by a javelin
general 2023-01-28 23:15:19 what if you need to shoot fortifications
general 2023-01-28 23:15:36 tanks carry a lot of HE shells
general 2023-01-28 23:16:20 its harder to get a plane and a heli to do that + less accuracy
general 2023-01-28 23:17:32 how
general 2023-01-28 23:17:45 the sky is full of radars looking up
general 2023-01-28 23:17:53 small arms fire from everywhere
general 2023-01-28 23:17:58 and helis are loud as hell
general 2023-01-28 23:20:09 pilots takes years to train
general 2023-01-28 23:20:24 you are not gonna waste them on bombing a trenchline
general 2023-01-28 23:20:37 both sides have filled with AA
general 2023-01-28 23:22:58 reclaiming land doesnt equal pushing in every part of the front
general 2023-01-28 23:23:06 some weak points they obviously will
general 2023-01-28 23:25:07 during the 6 day war M48's (i think) and T-54/T-55's had to fight each other, on which both sides would hit each other without a pen

plane-crazy 2023-02-04 00:27:59 You gotta maintain a low RCS during combat not before by just looking at a flat airframe
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 00:28:17 low observability
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 00:28:33 you said it was lacking in everything else, explain
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 00:29:33 you were to one claiming it was bad in every other aspect but at the same time dont know anything but the RCS

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:12:41 not really
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:12:50 😎
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:13:08 they developed it with the su-27
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:13:41 they used the su-27 as a testing aircraft for those
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:13:54 they are one circle fighters
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:14:02 they pull a lot of AOA in a few seconds
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:14:10 bleeding lots of airspeed
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:14:22 US fighters are meant for 2 circle, a long term dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:14:52 The SU-35 which has thrust vectoring and a lot of other massive changes, is insanely good at both
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:16:14 he wants YOU to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:16:32 Patriot
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:16:35 NASAMS
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:16:52 Maybe S-300 variant

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:31:24 yoo
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:32:25 insane
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:48:19 BUT
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:48:23 you dont even need the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:50:09 doesnt

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:50:48 when you make long enough missiles then you dont run through a lot of issues
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:51:14 joe and i did a test, where his ran with motor 2 control surfaces and mines simple non motor ones
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:51:24 he ran through a lot more stability problems
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:51:32 its not
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:51:34 the issue is
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:52:04 depending of where you place the weight and lift on your build (the circle things) the missiles may have their surfaces inverted or working properly
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:52:23 i ran through this issue when i placed the turret backwards (as of how it would originally store)
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:52:37 then goodluck
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:52:41 just travel fast
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:52:48 my SAM can practically fly
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:53:02 missiles can go up to 600 speed too
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:54:26 its just war thunder
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:55:16 smh if you try to shoot down something faster than 500 speed its really hard, not because missile bad or plane too good. theres like a 1-2 second explosion delay
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:55:30 meaning you gotta explode it incredibly far forward for it to impact
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:55:56 if you are going to kill tanks then you dont need more than 150 speed honestly
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:56:04 just anchor
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:56:06 which server btw
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:56:30 so many helis
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:56:53 it doesnt work bumping into a plane going faster than 500 sped
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:57:01 if that would even exist smh
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:57:10 both your missile and the target would need 0 ping
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:57:27 my missiles do have a decent impact fuse
