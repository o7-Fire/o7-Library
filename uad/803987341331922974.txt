general 2021-03-03 08:56:09 I like to use my PvP car

general 2021-03-03 08:58:58 Actually I would show my PvP car
general 2021-03-03 08:59:02 But it's low effort
general 2021-10-10 14:56:27 hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:15 Guys I'm in a PvP server with a shredder ball
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:21 Should I use my jet or car to kill it
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:29 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:33 Lemme load my hand build
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:57:55 If I'm gonna be honest, shredders are good
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:58:02 At being target practice
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 14:59:41 Like seriously
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:00:07 Why would you want to be a Plane Crazy YouTuber if people know you use a shredder ball
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:00:21 I saw that guy kill a tank cause his friend told him too
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:01:32 It feels sad knowing the grind who told his friend to shredder ball a tank is a donator
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:01:50 And I just had a chunk of my planes left wing shot off
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:02:27 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:02:34 It was a mini plane that shot the wing off
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:02:56 Still can fly tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:03:11 I had chunks of my jet shot off and yet it flies
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:05:29 Bruh I can't send pics

general 2021-10-11 14:36:32 Time to test if PvP works
general 2021-10-11 14:37:00 Nope it was just a random glitch
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:34:36 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:34:49 Stuck in a server with a motorlock shredder noob
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:07 Snow wheels have more grip
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:11 Problem is
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:17 If you turn at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:24 Your car can do a barrel roll
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:30 Or its for only my car idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:39:55 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:40:01 No but seriously
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:40:17 The funny thing is that the motorlock shredder doesn't even know how to motorlock correctly
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:40:22 She doesn't even know
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:40:47 Ah great, a shredder noob, death sphere and ground drones all in one server
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:00 I'm coping
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:10 I crash landed my jet into the shredder noobs plot
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:12 Oh no
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:21 She knows how to motorlock it
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:34 Wait awac
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:41:38 Lemme send a pic in dms
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:43:50 To be honest
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:43:56 I really want a good shredder user
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:44:02 Like imagine a shredder bug airshow
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:44:13 That's it
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:44:50 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:44:58 I just want good guy shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:45:06 Ikr
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:45:22 That's why I want a shredder bug airshow
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:45:27 To rate how trash they are
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:45:33 Much better
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:46:03 Have I ever mentioned my jet can still fly when like the entire left wing is cut off?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:46:17 Yeah it might stal
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:46:28 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:47:15 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:47:21 I got a shredder sphere on my tail
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:47:34 How does a jet
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:47:44 I'm faster than it
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:55:00 You could try to make it light or add helium
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:55:11 Ballast tanks can make it both surface and sink
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:55:15 Like a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 03:55:55 Isn't that one of the Iowas?

plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:35:40 Go to the gears
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:35:46 Scroll for a while
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:36:27 probably
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:36:54 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:37:41 Brb imma watch some squire
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:37:56 Good ol' If Fury was a German film
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:38:13 Man the original film was an American bias monstrosity
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:58:59 Yo I like what you did with the trails
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:14 Bet I can spot you
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:19 Once winter update is over
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:23 Man the fog is annoying
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:35 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:40 Lemme rephrase that
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:42 *cough*
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 04:59:56 Yo I like what the original creator did with the trails
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:00:02 I play on high quality
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:00:22 It's heavily annoying when you can't see where the enemy is
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:00:33 I might paint my jet in a full on white
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:00:49 Cause who flies a black jet in a white environment
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:25:31 At high speeds yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:25:50 Pretty much sword bug
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:25:54 They anchor themselves
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:26:02 And swing their sword at god knows how much speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:26:08 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:26:56 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:27:00 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:27:06 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 06:01:42 Noicr
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 06:01:43 Nocie
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 06:01:44 Noice
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:40:49 Question
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:41:05 Is outspeeding a good tactic for destroying shredders and Omni bugs?
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:42:14 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:42:23 I wanna show them true speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:43:54 I think he just isn't experienced
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:44:17 But I did see an Omni bug managing to chase me when I was going 1137
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:46:47 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:46:56 What were you doing?
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:46:59 Like sharp turns?
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:47:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:47:25 I use glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:48:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:48:39 Usually I reduce speed to get the enemy plane in my gun sights
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:49:08 Then hold Left Mouse
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:50:20 Well I do ambush
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:50:26 Usually from the top
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:50:58 I do need to reduce speed before my jet hits 1400
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:51:32 Have you tried motorlocking?
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 08:51:38 Still not good at it
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 09:02:18 Is that a flying boat?
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 10:40:14 Man I wish more people use jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 10:40:16 Ya know
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 10:40:24 Dogfights and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 10:44:05 Ik
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 10:44:16 Most PvP servers I see have ships and weird cars
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:50:53 Hey guy's
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:51:00 How fast does an average SAM missile fly at?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:51:15 As in the anti air missile
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:51:35 Is 1.1k fast enough to outrun it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:52:22 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:52:26 Sorry I mean in game
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:52:27 Not irl
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:52:33 Should have mentioned that earlier
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:52:58 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:00:32 Thoughts on the firefly?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:00:48 In war thunder
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:01:03 Heard the speed is decent and the armour is trash for the tier
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:01:26 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:42 ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:45 Anyways
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:52 How fast does the average plane crazy missile go
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:59 I've seen some go 400
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:04 And then there's the hover engine
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:07 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:17 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:42 I had to reduce the speed from 1200+ to 1100 because it kept shaking in laggy PvP servers
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:48 Still goes 1400+ when diving
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:04:04 Welcome to hover engine + glitch mouse
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:04:49 Not sure
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:04:54 I didn't make an ejector with that model
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:13 That hover engine jet is literally a mod for another normal jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:53 I only use it for maneuverability
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:06:20 That and my rocket boosters and hovers are already set to WS
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:05 I haven't tried WASD
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:18 Glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:44 Also the main purpose was to get shredder bugs to chase me and proceed to laugh as they
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:45 Uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:51 Not being able to chase
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:08:29 ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:08:49 Ikr
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:08:58 My normal jet uses canards
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:11 Because it just wouldn't maneuver well without it
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:29 If my jet goes too slow, it literally just won't turn
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:32 Or pull up
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:00 Might be stall speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:05 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:26 Yeah I was going about 200+ that time
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:32 Not sure about the weight
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:41 Cruise speed is around 500
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:11:32 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:12:25 I also don't know why my jet can still fly when there's a massive hole in the wings and fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:13:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:13:54 Only starts to go bad turning when an entire wing is gone
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:18:54 Ever seen a jet doing crazy stunts near your base?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:18:59 Like flying between builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:59:33 Not to mention that's the current version of the iron cross
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 04:00:01 That the Bundeswehr uses
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:44:10 Question
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:44:32 Is one gun on the nose or two guns near the cockpit better in a jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:46:08 As in is the part highlighted in red or blue better
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:46:24 My jet currently uses the part in red
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:48:37 Basically when the time I use both
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:48:54 The red is better at focusing on a single target
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:49:00 The blue is better are wider stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:51:47 I
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:51:51 Is this even a real thing?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:52:04 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:52:19 Lemme check YouTube
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:54:23 Oh god it's real
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:55:44 Lemme find a good emoji
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:56:05 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:56:08 This will do
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:25:38 So which is a better placement for the guns?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:25:41 In plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:46:21 Wait how fast is speed calculated
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 04:46:27 Is it like studs for second?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 05:17:52 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:35:15 Random question
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:35:40 What are your thoughts on shredders that attack lag machines/toxic users?
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:36:13 Honestly I feel like shredders are the oppressor mk2 of Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:36:34 Like both are op vehicles that can easily ruin people's days
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:36:48 Both have earned a bad reputation from the majority of people using them
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:38:03 I don't kill shredders
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:38:07 I simply can't get a good aim
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:38:22 All I can do is just bait them to chase me
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:38:31 I use glitch mouse
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:39:01 Honestly most shredders are around 400-500 speed according to my research and testing
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:40:25 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:40:32 Honestly my own shredder is just made for testing
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:40:45 I want to test something? Cool just slap the thing onto it and see what happens
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:41:05 I rarely bring my shredder out since watching them chase you in a jet is more funny
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:41:33 I did build and modify it to destroy other shredders but now it's just collecting dust
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:44:02 This and high chance the whole server will gang up on you even if you have good intentions
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:46:17 I think I even made the thing into a rocket because the tail managed to keep it still
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:46:34 I mean I wouldn't count that as a shredder if I saw one
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:47:52 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 05:55:36 Looks like something from a Sci-Fi movie
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:06:33 Will Plane Crazy 2 have tunnels and massive canyons?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:06:49 Sorry for the weird question, I just feel bored flying my jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:12:07 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:13:12 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:13:28 Ace Combat intensifies
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:16:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:16:47 Nice A-10 btw
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:21:09 Isn't the whole point of a tutorial to be copied?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:21:29 Saying "you copied a tutorial" is like idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:23:49 I mean I technically modded my own jet once
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:24:09 To a hover engine monstrosity that can't fly in laggy servers
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:24:22 Good thing it's in another save
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:24:28 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:24:34 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:33:42 Is a glitch mouse and WASD hybrid a good idea?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:33:57 As in alternating between both
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 13:40:14 Also imagine driving your car on the highway (or bridge) as shown in the teaser and suddenly a jet starts chasing you
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:23:55 Of what
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:24:10 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:24:11 Motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:24:23 Motor 2 Mobile?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:24:52 You shall remember this day as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:30:04 So is it actually Motor 2 Mobile?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:30:16 If so then how is it?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:31:23 Is it the worst idea ever to come to Plane Crazy or an idea so good that Lockheed Martin should hire you?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:38:28 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:38:37 I have no idea what m2m is and literally just heard of it today
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:40:15 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:40:24 That's the purpose of my shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:40:40 Too bad it's collecting dust since watching enemy shredders struggle to chase you is funnier
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:41:38 So is it better than normal control surfaces/glitch mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:42:56 Basically using explosive blocks as armour
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:43:03 Guns can't pass through them
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:43:10 Iirc
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:43:41 Put it in strategic locations I would say
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:01 Cover it with other blocks to hide the exposed parts (at least before they blow up the disguise)
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:15 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:34 Only thing that would destroy you is immobilizing your wheels or pushing you off the map
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:37 Ye
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:40 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 14:44:46 Idk I don't use TNT armour
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:11:17 Welp
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:11:28 Just added a WASD and glitch mouse hybrid to my jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:11:49 I mean the wings like to shake when turning
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:13:14 Ok forget this the motor 2s go up and down only
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:17:16 What's the best motor 2 speed for a WASD jet?
plane-crazy 2022-07-24 15:30:45 Ight
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:39:37 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:39:52 Where is the best spot to place my fireworks on my jet?
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:40:09 On the wing tips, near the rockets or near the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:40:22 Like the nose?
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:40:47 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:13:37 Random question
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:13:45 What's the fastest vehicle you own?
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:14:15 Amogus
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:16:21 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:20:52 What like glitch mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:34:22 Would Plane Crazy 2 have better train tracks?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:34:33 I really wanna go full Shinkansen with my bullet train
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:35:58 It's not that great
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:36:06 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:36:10 Forgot
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:36:14 Been ages since I used it
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:39:34 
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:39:50 Added the stairs to make getting off and on stations (for me) easier
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:40:29 267-268
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:40:46 Only limited due to the turns
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:42:22 Could theoretically go much faster without the turns limiting it
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 14:45:15 Might fuse car 1-2 and 3-4
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 15:49:37 *sniff*
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 15:49:39 It's beautiful
plane-crazy 2022-08-27 15:49:53 Especially the Shinkansen
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:30:02 Random question
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:30:27 Is there any other way to stop jet shaking other than removing engines/getting a better PC/going slower
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:34:30 Huh
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:35:38 Imma try that
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:38:44 Just goes
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:38:47 Left right left right
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:39:14 I think the fabric wings are working
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:42:24 Yup they work
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:44:49 Now only shakes when high speed turns
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:52:33 Wait nvm
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 09:52:41 It's just the server isn't laggy and FPS is green
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:03:37 *shrug*
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:03:41 Might as well modify the thing for higher speed
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:03:47 Noice
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:05:44 Man FPS drops when high speeds
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:06:48 I know
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:08:41 Wait really?
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:08:43 Ight imma just
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:09:34 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:10:37 Ight changed it
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:10:56 Yup it's definitely faster from the auto
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:11:20 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:11:22 1700
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:11:45 Welp time to add the wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:13:29 Thanks for telling me that btw
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:14:56 Basing the wings on the Su-57 lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:14:59 Moment
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:27:29 Added carpet wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:27:31 It's gone insane
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:35:01 Yeah no it glitches it
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:35:03 Goes shaky
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:36:59 I got flung out of it
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:38:17 Ok decreased some hover thrusters and works better
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:40:59 Mkay can do 1280 before shaking
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 14:41:05 Also when are they gonna change to winter update
