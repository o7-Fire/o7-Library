general 2022-06-20 18:10:39 bro what is he saying üíÄ
general 2022-06-20 18:11:07 only takes me 2 seconds
general 2022-06-20 18:11:53 bros living in opposite day
general 2022-06-20 18:12:14 yes and no
general 2022-06-20 18:12:18 they barely last
general 2022-06-20 18:12:25 but they have better quality
general 2022-06-20 18:12:29 and proccesors
general 2022-06-21 12:20:23 i build airships
general 2022-06-21 12:20:33 zeppelins to be exact
general 2022-06-21 12:20:40 i got 2 of em
general 2022-06-21 12:20:45 custom ones
general 2022-06-21 12:20:55 moonchild, a passenger zeppelin
general 2022-06-21 12:21:08 and voyage, the outdated one i still need to update
general 2022-06-21 12:21:14 voyage is a bomber
general 2022-06-21 12:22:12 well i made it when i thought all zeppelins looked the same
general 2022-06-21 12:22:25 so its a passenger with bombs in it
general 2022-06-21 12:22:26 lel
general 2022-06-21 12:22:32 BRO THAT LOOKS AMAZING
general 2022-06-21 12:22:48 its a bit blocky
general 2022-06-21 12:23:19 i need to make some sort of huge war zeppelin soon
general 2022-06-21 12:24:04 hm, seems i could do that
general 2022-06-21 12:24:50 i got my airship style from one of my friends
general 2022-06-21 12:24:56 gas bag*
general 2022-06-21 12:25:36 thats a blimp
general 2022-06-21 12:25:52 oh i thought u said airship
general 2022-06-21 12:26:09 heres the difference betweeen blimps and airships
general 2022-06-21 12:26:20 airships have rigid structure
general 2022-06-21 12:26:24 blimps inflate
general 2022-06-21 12:26:46 then that isnt an airship
general 2022-06-21 12:26:52 thats a blimp
general 2022-06-21 12:26:55 all it is
general 2022-06-21 12:26:57 a blimp
general 2022-06-21 12:27:07 imo
general 2022-06-21 12:27:15 blimps are ugly
general 2022-06-21 12:27:23 same with modernized zeppelins
general 2022-06-21 12:27:30 looks good
general 2022-06-21 12:27:49 good for nothing but advertising
general 2022-06-21 12:27:51 thing is
general 2022-06-21 12:28:03 notice how we havent seen any around for a while?
general 2022-06-21 12:28:24 2018
general 2022-06-21 12:28:38 then they jit vanished
general 2022-06-21 12:29:12 "just a few patches to get it flying"
general 2022-06-21 12:29:28 sure, zeppelins are more unsafe
general 2022-06-21 12:29:35 but with todays economy
general 2022-06-21 12:29:44 we can use helium in zeppelins
general 2022-06-21 12:29:57 just bring back the old zeppelin designs
general 2022-06-21 12:30:38 petition to bring back old airships but use helium instead
general 2022-06-21 12:30:47 old airships were gorgeous
general 2022-06-21 12:30:57 modernized airships look horrible
general 2022-06-21 12:31:56 if i could go back in time, i would go back to zeppelins with a whole lotta helium
general 2022-06-21 12:31:59 so they can use it
general 2022-06-21 12:33:13 but they decided to stop with the hindenburg
general 2022-06-21 12:34:29 yo, how bout we hop on roblox and check out eachothers airships
general 2022-06-21 12:34:34 i got a private server
