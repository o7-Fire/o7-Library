general 2021-09-10 10:53:32 and sometimes it doesn't do that

general 2021-09-10 11:03:46 how tf do i fix this on off engine bs
general 2021-09-10 11:04:11 its easier to explain with on/off engine
general 2021-09-10 11:04:16 than with motor
general 2021-09-10 11:04:21 but it happens on both pieces
general 2021-09-10 11:04:27 so its the same problem
