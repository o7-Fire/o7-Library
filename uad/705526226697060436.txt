bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:21:52 its a centipede that has a little mouth with cutters inside of it, and it was working fine until the cutters just stopped working, i was in pvp mode and spawn protection wasn't the issue, they just didn't work
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:21:55 maybe its a bug
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:21:58 or glitch
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:22:25 no that is a good idea
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:22:27 ill try
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:26:30 nope
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:26:46 and its only that specific builds that the cutters dont work
bug-reports 2022-05-24 23:26:56 i have other cutter-based builds that work fine
bug-reports 2022-05-25 00:05:42 **has anyone made any progress on finding out information on the glitch i presented to this chat a while ago**
bug-reports 2022-05-25 00:17:34 OMG
bug-reports 2022-05-25 00:17:37 YOU WERE RIGHT
bug-reports 2022-05-25 00:17:46 I HAD ONE AT THE CORNER OF MY PLOT
bug-reports 2022-05-25 01:29:12 rick we fixed it
bug-reports 2022-05-25 01:29:43 i had an anchor block on my plot and it was preventing the cutters from damaging
bug-reports 2022-05-25 19:32:13 ;-;
bug-reports 2022-05-25 19:32:54 i had accidentaly placed one there and i forgor ðŸ’€
general 2022-05-26 00:00:37 maybe they will fix tnt lag in plane crazy 2, because missiles become useless with tnt lag
general 2022-05-26 00:00:46 seems like a good fix
general 2022-05-26 00:00:51 not sure how easy it would be tho
general 2022-05-26 00:03:16 s m a r t
general 2022-05-26 00:03:32 thats smart
general 2022-05-26 00:04:34 yea
general 2022-05-26 00:04:42 maybe ill play around with that idea
general 2022-05-26 00:04:46 and find a cool design
general 2022-05-27 00:50:31 why the hell do i have to input my credit card for a FREE month of nitro, and why does it say Line_1 when i do
general 2022-05-27 00:50:32 ???

general 2022-05-30 00:19:19 what setting do you have to put on a ballast block to counter a helium block
general 2022-05-30 00:19:20 ?
creations-chat 2022-05-30 02:48:42 
creations-chat 2022-05-30 02:58:02 why did i get so many downvotes for my escape pod ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:11:10 orb what is going on
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:21:39 its an escape pod
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:24:12 its inspired by star wars and i spent so long making it ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:27:59 A Star Wars inspired escape pod, used for escaping dumb shredders lol.  I am still working on interior, and it works in 0 gravity
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:30:14 here was my inspiration
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:32:22 here are my images
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:48:14 people have such high expectations in <#384025409945337856> and **murder** anyone who doesn't meet them
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:50:31 its not a bullet bill knockoff lol
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:52:56 THANK YOU, FINALLY SOMEONE LIKES SOMETHING I MAKE
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:55:49 hm well the pod is kinda big. BUT the minigun has 3 weapons, the main gun having an accurate and spread mode. and the entire thing has a tnt core making it almost insestructable
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:58:43 yea well the pod was kinda supposed to be big. A lot of the features people hate are a regular implement in my builds
creations-chat 2022-05-30 21:04:59 i need some pro builder's help here. What is the EXACT counter to a helium block with a ballast block
creations-chat 2022-05-30 21:07:01 lol i have been trying for 30 minutes
