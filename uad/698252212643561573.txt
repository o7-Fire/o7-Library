The Tale of dreamerdier (698252212643561573)
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 03:07:06 SOOOO I'm making a backrooms map. I use this weird glitch to make players phase through my build and then click a button and it appears on their screen. Basically, one moment they are minding their business, and the next moment, they hear buzzing everywhere and it is just yellow wallpaper. I have 3 levels so far. In my first level (lvl 0) you have to find a sign that unlocks the door for level 1. In the second level (Lvl 1) you need to type a code in chat that you could find in lvl 0 (Which you can still go back to). After that is the third level (level 2), which is the creepiest one that a absolutely poured my ideas into. It is the electrical hallways but darker and cave themed. There are many puzzles and some things I don't really want to spoil. **I want ideas for my fourth level, can someone give me some pls?** I'm thinking of staying mostly lore accurate as with my previous levels but I'm not sure if I should make my own or make an alternate version of the actual fourth level on the wikidot (Level 3). I made a horror map previous to this that is completely original and it is pretty big (tbh) so I already have experience if I want to be original, what do you think?
