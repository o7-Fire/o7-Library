plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:45:37 yo guys do you know why my plane is ascending without me pressing anything?
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:47:19 is helium really making my plane go up without pressing anything
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 04:21:52 yo guys why is my plane diving down or going up without me touching it at all
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 00:32:46 how do you stop your plane from shaking? when you do a hard turn
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 00:34:34 <@!707991071476547745>  whats the average speed do i need so i stop shaking in a hard turn
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 00:36:13 ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 00:38:53 i did that and its still shaking
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:18:23 ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:02:23 why do slow downs happen when you drive a vehicle in this game?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:02:54 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:03:07 is their a way to reduce it?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:03:24 bruh'
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:04:04 i only have motors and rockets and thats about it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:04:13 i drive a plane and i have custom landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:04:24 
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:04:33 
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:06:33 i have 25 rockets inside this plane and im getting physics lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:06:39 and 8 motors used only
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:08:46 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:08:53 is that too much or
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:10:01 uhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:10:05 to reach high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:10:11 how much do i need only
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:11:28 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:14:35 <@!396200986386890762> i place my  super rockets on the sides not at the back
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:16:42 is super rocket placements making my plane lag or no>
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:17:08 da heck
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:18:31 thats strange
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:19:12 my other jets have more blocks than my small build aircraft and they dont have physics laf
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:30:31 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:30:34 im mad and sad
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:56:58 do motors cause physical lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:19:05 do on and off super rocket engines create physical lag as well
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 07:59:34 where do you find vip links in this server?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:37:49 can you fly a jet without a vertical wing?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:38:10 how
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:39:04

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:56:48 so no more adversity yaw for me?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 23:06:24 what creats physical lag in this game
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 23:06:28 creates?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 09:04:55 everytime i motor lock my rudder and put it inside my plane why does it spazz out?

plane-crazy 2020-10-12 21:55:58 but what kind of good builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 21:56:15 i like making concept builds not irl vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:07:20 how do you anchor toggable motors?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:27:57 yo guys does cameras make you lag if you put allot of them
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 20:16:40 yo what do you think of this spaceship design?

plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:17:38 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:21:11 yo guys, how do you anchor toggable motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:23:38 like anchoring tilted vertical stavs
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:23:40 stabsd
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:34:52 wdym gyro
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:38:36 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 09:00:45 does the vertical stabs fit the design in this jet?
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 09:03:03 idk
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 09:19:09 <@!289930922655088640> does the vertical stabs placement fit in this design?

plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:54:17 do yall got any ideas how to make a aircraft have smooth handling?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:56:13 whats the stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:57:43 give me an example
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:58:20 i need help stabilizing vtol actually
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:58:29 give me ideas how to make a very stable vtol
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:58:35 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 00:40:35 guys everytime i roll on my plane it descends very slowly why is that the case?
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:17:12 guys what blocks make you lag the most in this game???
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:18:57 my jet lags at 851 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:18:59 what?
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:20:02 i mean what blocks makes you drop fps
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:20:06 the most
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:20:09 ghjhjhjhj
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:20:51 <@!453015366281723905>  its not that easy\
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:22:22 springs.... hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 09:23:05 are motors and wing pannels make you drop fps too?
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 09:30:50 what do box intakes do?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 03:42:00 aircraft (XVM2 Star Fighter) has been updated it
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:52:30 Is this plane blocky or no, and is it good enough to be a tutorial plane
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:54:35 has vtol, can reverse (only for 100 S.T.U.D.S and advanced controls for vtol also can pitch and roll sharply as an option by pressing a certain button
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:56:51 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 02:10:40 guys does anybody know how to make stable vtol
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 02:26:27 i did but for some reason when i decrease the power on the vtol to land it nose dives how do i stabilize it when i need to land without adjusting it?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:41:20 what are hover thrusters and what are they used for
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:42:12 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:43:44 huh? i thought they can help me stabilize my vtol on planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:46:26 i have another question, when im using vtol and i decrease its power to land for some reason it nose dives and its left in an akward position 
how do i fix it and yes all rockets are equaled out i think
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:54:55 yikes
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:30:02 what do yall thing about this weird plane i just built recently

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 06:31:36 can anyone give me tips how to replicate an existing design
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 06:31:53 im struggling to replicate an existing aircraft or spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 01:03:51 Anybody knows why my plane is going left? nothing is misplaced btw so is it a bug or something?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:29:20 why is my tank turret spinning uncontrollably
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:30:40 its only set to 1
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:32:01 <@!714878625484243101> wdym by mass?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:33:37 HMMM
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:33:39 caps
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:34:36 <@!714878625484243101> so you mean i need to balance out the weight to stop spinning unctrollably?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 18:37:49 ok lets see if i can fix it
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 19:18:14 <@!714878625484243101> ye for some reason my tank is still spinning uncontrollably even though i put ballast blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 19:29:27 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 19:29:29 no
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 19:29:33 im using motor 2

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 05:23:25 ?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 22:14:53 anybody knows how to make flat cockpits for your jets (no angles)
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 22:18:52 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:48:07 what yall think of this build and dont mind the rockets below the wings because im still doing the detail and vtol balances
can yall give me feedback on this so i can make better builds next time
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:48:54 i did use materials
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:49:51 working on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:50:28 thanks, im making 2 versions of it a civilian and militarized
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:50:58 sorta
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:52:41 hmmm, i dont know how to use them yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:53:39 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:54:49 i see
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:55:52 anyways, the build will be possibly be done by tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:57:30 ik but im estimating that it will be done tommorow because i only need to work on 2 times, details with purpose and vtol balances <@!581412939223924767>
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 10:02:46 dam
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 10:24:17 can you make text 3 fonts bigger
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 10:24:19 ?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 01:47:33 how do you add image details within your build?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 01:49:14 whats the website that gives you diverse detailed emoji?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 01:51:13 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:13:48 ye guys this build is literally trying to go right in vtol mode even though both aerodynamic, vtol allignment and material placement is in the right spot and it only happens in vtol mode
however the plane is balanced in flight mode anybody know why my build is literally tilting right even though i think everything is alligned
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:14:52 <@!723940197456281640> explain?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:16:01 its balanced
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:17:47 <@!723940197456281640> have any ideas how to fix it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:21:05 <@!723940197456281640> one of the vtol placement is angled however thats only the back but the front is not angled
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:22:28 btw this problem only happened soon after i put winglights on the build and thats when the spinning obstacle started idk how but thats when it started doing it's magic
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 05:17:41 is ice heavier than default material or no?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 11:47:29 Ya guys how do you add images in the texts within your build?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 11:48:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 11:48:40 i see
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 11:53:32 huh
creations-chat 2021-11-27 22:56:02 should i do anything with the flat surfaced areas in this build or something

i recently got back from taking a break from this game
general 2023-05-23 03:07:03 <@715148402022678608> you can actually, i dont know how the mechanics work

general 2023-05-23 03:09:49 no

plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:56:45 im making this, is this possible to like not have 0 sharp edges or 99% no sharp edges
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:56:48 
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:57:09 
creations-chat 2023-05-27 23:05:52 its like a spaceship  but i want feedback on if i can reduce the sharp edges
creations-chat 2023-05-27 23:14:16 its possible
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 00:02:03 nice
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:15 yo progress report
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:34 
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:37:43 take a guess
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:39:27 i dare someone to make this
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:40:07 their just minimalistic thats why you think nothing is going on with it
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:41:38 <@463591189220687873> its in space and plus its futuristic who knows whats it made off <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:44:31 well<@463591189220687873> space is cold, so space must have nitrogen, even though there isnt air, molecules still exist in space, therefore the air intake is to intake nitrogen mostly
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:45:07 
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:46:35 <@463591189220687873> it is true,  but if the fuel is hydrogen nothing can combust it
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:46:38 it needs water to do so
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:48:56 its possible to build it in plane crazy, it just doesnt have to be realistic, thats why we can build those halo planes in this game
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:49:35 could be
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:49:51 we can say its impossible but someone is gonna build it in the next 50 years or 500 years
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:50:07 science was meant to be questioned
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:50:43 <@463591189220687873> well this ships lore was made in 2953 so who knows
plane-crazy 2023-05-28 03:51:09 are you gonna build it

plane-crazy 2023-05-29 06:52:58 other wise it will block intake
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 06:53:01 like half

creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:41:06 i did, it was more effective to send it to creations chat to see how people react to it, since barely anyone does in any of the chats thats meant to showcase wip builds, i just happened to wake yall up
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:43:30 https://tenor.com/view/surprise-mysterious-gif-25134076
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:46:44 dam its a work in progress, it doesn't hurt to look at something unpolished for once, dam either some incident happened that considered it a cardinal sin or you guys got nothing to do in your lives
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:49:59 now im genuinely curious why the response it's such a big deal  or yall just  dont go outside
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:52:43 hey you, made a mockery out of it, you can't just say im the one who made the big deal
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:54:57 I was just trying to find out the greater picture of this rule but its literally just the rule, dam, i don't know why its a rule but its just a rule, shut up and conform is the name of the game huh
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:57:22 <@814978152672657458> you just compared a crime that disrupt the flow of economy to an unexplained uproar of a wip
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:59:28 so no one knows why this rule was made in the first place huh?
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:11:34 show me your best builds so i can shut up now, because i am tired of seeing modern already made builds, i want to see something new for once
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:15:48 this is mine, it was made a year ago got 170 upvotes, where those new locking techniques wasnt founded yet

<@447854978103640075>  he said it was so bad but haven't provided atleast one of his builds except look up this which i dont know
@Deleted User d1eecf54#9243 to see his builds
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:18:54 <@814978152672657458> i dont care if its a wip just show im genuinely curious, i want to see the new era of builds unless its at home on a laptop

creations-chat 2023-05-31 05:44:37 you must understand the demand and profitability is not worth it
especially when roblox corp take 80% of your profits from your game
<@782711868179480656>
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:46:19 <@782711868179480656>  its time for rick to freelance new devs for his game
creations-chat 2023-05-31 05:47:09 talk in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:47:53 <@509543597398425601>i looked at the abrams tank, and its excellent, fair enough to criticize on the simple build
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:48:23 <@782711868179480656>who is working on plane crazy two
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:49:14 <@509543597398425601> gives me motivation to make those scifi ships but im busy in the week days

plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:50:39 <@467459282250629120> is rick the only person working on pc2
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:50:45 if so he needs to hire developers
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:51:26 <@782711868179480656> you can't work an individual if the pay is not good
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:51:55 its easier to play than to work
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:53:09 <@782711868179480656>well lets see, whats the difference between the current game and the new pc, what changes will he bring
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:53:41 i just got back
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:54:47 how long did it take you
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:54:56 because this build was beyond its time
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:55:26 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:55:35 dam you played for a long time
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:56:48 well so umm what does pc2 that rick will add that this game does not have <@509543597398425601>
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:57:50 why cant he add it in this game
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:57:54 its the same
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:57:59 but updated features
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:58:22 <@509543597398425601>
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:59:21 so your telling me ricky is the only one building this game
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 05:59:49 zaegw tslk;jnezo;lznetg
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:02:48 well we really only got 3 choices guys 
One we elongate build meta of this game by making those advance as detailed builds
We offer him developers to actually finish the game
Wait or do a little funny
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:03:08 cant really do much especially if the profits for roblox game like this is low
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:04:34 so his offer was shit
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:06:29 what happened to flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:06:40 that one game someone made for a potential plane crazy gamer
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:07:05 why is their only 27 people playing
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:07:06 umm
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:14:39 <@509543597398425601> Umm why cant i turn the flaps in flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 06:23:52 <@509543597398425601>its a weird one to transition to
creations-chat 2023-05-31 06:32:22 how
creations-chat 2023-06-03 01:17:54 hey were the spacehips at
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:01:06 Someone should make this, test your building skills I want someone to actually build it for real with great 70% accuracy
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:03:22 
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 21:05:10 Someone should make this. Don't care that it's unrealistic or so something just try building it and see what happens, can you replicate it or not. That's what I'm asking
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:06:43 
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:09:05 Here is blueprint and better quality
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:15:26 Send me those 30 when I build it first
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:41:55 <@743080739972710492>  I know that ship design
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:44:44 <@743080739972710492>  well this is what I'm making
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:50:27 Almost but it's very sleek
creations-chat 2023-06-03 21:53:23 <@692512634028818555>  the nose is angled locked 45 degree down but the front is wedges
<@734179928559321248>  the image I sent is a week ago I just got back and I made a few changes not big though
creations-chat 2023-06-03 22:51:52 This is what my ship design was based of
creations-chat 2023-06-03 22:54:06 This I mean
creations-chat 2023-06-03 23:15:30 I can redesign it again  that's still the old
creations-chat 2023-06-03 23:20:53 I'm nit done yet don't worry
creations-chat 2023-06-03 23:51:19 <@375281006091173890>  what happened
creations-chat 2023-06-04 00:01:47 How did the good turn bad how, but I just notice the nose was too big
creations-chat 2023-06-04 03:31:18 this better or worse
creations-chat 2023-06-04 03:33:58 
creations-chat 2023-06-04 03:36:13 i guess
creations-chat 2023-06-04 06:38:29 new look
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 06:51:19 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-04 06:51:24 make sure all of them has a purpose
creations-chat 2023-06-04 16:21:05 <@814978152672657458> yes i aint the only one
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:06:26 Do you guys get compounding ping when you assemble your builds wihen using motorlocks and other locks etc
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:08:28 also whats the point of plane crazy 2 when the whole concept of the game doesnt change and it only features 2 major changes that isn't mandatory for a sequel?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:09:03 <@448677698773057547> you can do that in pc1
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:09:09 the concept is the same
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:10:24 well that is true,  but if the major update is a new map and custom angles, etc. woudln't just be another easy update?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:10:30 like
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:10:32 get pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:10:33 now
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:10:47 dam
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:11:23 gets banned
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:11:44 @<@448677698773057547>well lets take into account the profit for roblox games
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:11:55 how much is he making for it to be worth
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:12:34 i heard they don't get paid shit, most of the income roblox game devs make goes to roblox
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:12:56 <@448677698773057547> also he can just freelance new devs
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:13:03 if he wants to be that lazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:14:02 <@780574146919792700> at this point yeah, im getting 10k ping and more trying to assemble a spaceship which i haven't added anything to move it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:14:30 <@448677698773057547> i don't know if i can say thats allot or not
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:15:18 there is a thing called developer trials, and if someone messes up the code, he still can retreat to first game and still make money and just recode it the mistakes right?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:16:15 <@448677698773057547> well thats the first thing you have to go through as devs, you are gonna need a team to make the game big
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:16:23 <@448677698773057547> your either stagnant or progressing
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:16:49 being complacent stalls profit, and kills the game in the long run
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:17:12 ye but if you want to make the game big then a team is needed
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:18:31 @<@448677698773057547> the profit aint good enough for a sequel huh time to move on to the next game
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:18:38 there is flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:18:53 idk why people arent playing that, same thing but has the pc2 features
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:19:20 probably its on alpha stage
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:19:23 hence alpha
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:21:37 <@448677698773057547> ye its just not allot of profit thats why so you have these instances, the money aint worth the risk
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:22:53 <@448677698773057547> the playerbase of roblox are kids, and modeling is not an easy talent, it takes skill, and making your own designs takes more skill, thats why people replicate models instead of designing
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:23:49 is it categorize that their young, and with the age level of kids?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:24:09 what is considered a kid, before 18 or less than 13?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:24:30 well ok if its teens, still not an easy skill to get into with modeling and what i said on the previous point
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:24:38 ye
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:25:35 ye the creations are proving me otherwise, yes there is still good builders but idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:26:07 <@448677698773057547> what happened
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:26:29 why don't they post anymore?
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:27:30 <@448677698773057547> ye but if one leaves another replaces,

plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:28:17 <@448677698773057547> well the good players used to be bad that became good took months and years to get good
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:29:44 <@448677698773057547> well if they build things that already exist and so many has built it before such as tomcats and hornets but made it better
then your literally just making the same thing but increasing quality
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:29:48 its time to make something new

plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:47:38 ultimate big man  my own design
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:48:52 <@780574146919792700> what does that mean
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:49:01 <@456226577798135808> exposed motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:49:23 <@456226577798135808> nah
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:50:54 anyways what should i improve on this one, except nose cause its old

plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:52:23 <@448677698773057547> its 2018 moment
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:52:48 you get the point
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:53:17 but for real though, what should be the improvement on this one, except nose since its an old one and its gaps are already filled

plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:54:57 <@456226577798135808> give me a sec of side view
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:56:33 still relevant to why
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:56:47 <@572167760394584075> if its pvp then it dont matter for looks
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:59:06 <@456226577798135808>  i want to show side but this BUILD is giving me 10k ping for just assembling
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:01:51 ignore that beam
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:02:37 <@456226577798135808> nose is already small
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:03:12 
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:04:00 
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:04:12 
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:04:14 my design
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:06:08 it already is but its simplified because there is no lines and its 15 degrees, so it will look worse if attempted
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:06:11 we will see
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:07:48 <@780574146919792700> 7
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:07:51 idk what it is rn
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:52 ALSO
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:09:57 WHATS WITH THIS GAMES LATENCY
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:07 I can't even just assemble a big ship with getting 10k
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:10:52 thats lighting
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:54 BRUH
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:11:59 im not even on the seat
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:02 8k
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:12:04 ping
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:16:54 also
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:16:59 learn how to magnet
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:17:00 lock
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:17:14 you can discard motorlock once your done the process
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:18:17 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91BrZ9F-7_o&pp=ygUdbWFnbmV0aWMgbG9ja2luZyBwbGFuZSBjcmF6eSA%3D
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:18:34 dont kinda need to but basics
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:19:10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLmHns90XMA&t=313s&pp=ygUdbWFnbmV0aWMgbG9ja2luZyBwbGFuZSBjcmF6eSA%3D
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:19:46 when activating magnet it will leave big  gap, use pistons to fill gap
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:23:49 <@780574146919792700> only downside when using this, there might be chance you can't use this on non pvp servers, you need to use pvp blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:24:08 <@495210490172014612>  how so
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:24:35 probably you didnt have the right settings
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:24:47 
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:25:07 huh
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:25:35 what is it not working on
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:25:39 if its too far
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:25:45 like 5 block or more it wont attract
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:26:50 show me problem

creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:00:54 That is true  but oh well, teach em the ways
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:03:13 Thus the whitenames can't learn and the game can't grow
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:20:26 <@814978152672657458>  well the 50% who don't got an ego needs help the most should still be assisted instead of made fun of
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:24:06 <@814978152672657458> we also gotta bring back actual pvp combat
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:26:27 Time to evolve bitches do we want this game to die or to become evolve the Era of building <@823296173426081862>

plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:53:38 I<@889982629124927508>  I can look at it
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:54:19 On discord
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 19:54:46 Can you send picture it's easier I can't play in the weekdays
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 20:23:22 <@889982629124927508> i see
creations-chat 2023-06-06 23:27:54 what is happening
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 23:36:23 <@790836402102730752> How can i help you? to get better
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:14:49 what are you guys arguing about, is it about who can build better or something else?
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:29:55 really? well ok, anyways can you show the su 57 now?
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:55:24 hey guys i have an idea to ressurect the game,
we make tutorial builds for noobs
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:00:16 <@912065912658608190> idk about those,  they are surface level builds, but a very good design tutorial build, that is either custom or made from a game, a design no one has built and seen before but normally when you do that you get a video like this 
which is very time consuminghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddy_ARC75JM&t=14s&pp=ygUVcGxhbmUgY3JhenkgdHV0b3JpYWxz
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:04:30 they include all locking techniques that makes a design look good, but here is my proposition what if we make a tutorial that lasts 10 minutes, and its a playlist of parts where it builds the different parts, how they work and why they work<@1001565219828543538>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:08:03 There is more, this helps the whitenames and noobs to actually learn how all great detailed builds are built and assembled, thus giving them hope to get good at the game. Furthermore, since pc2 is not being developed for its low return of investment, if everything goes to plan, the playerbase goes up because we gave the noobs a path follow to get good, rick will notice this and actually has a reason to continue development, for its fan base is growing again <@1001565219828543538>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:10:14 im telling the people who sees this, as a chance to actually respark the playerbase, you can take this idea and do it however you guys do with it, but i need your help when doing so.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:17:40 how you do that, and if you read the idea your a great candidate. if you agree, well you can do whatever you want with the idea.
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 03:19:32 oh sh.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:20:48 <@467459282250629120> if you guys want to actually get this idea in motion, just let me copy your builds, and ill do the rest of the work or we can work together to get it in motion.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:22:50 if you want to part of it, ill credit you, your discord and roblox username or whatever that you build it, and i just show the noobs and whitenames how your build works and how its going to get built <@467459282250629120>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:25:29 if you me let copy your build and use it for the tutorial and not any of the work to proceed with this idea, then thats the plan
actually i have experience on doing it, <@375281006091173890>  but if we want to get it in motion right away then thats the plan
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:28:18 i can do it myself, but im giving you an idea that can spark the player base again because the biggest common factor of the game dying is the new players not learning how the game works
and 
1. you dont play the game anymore so you dont matter
2. you don't see the vision i have.
3. if it works, your left with no profits with working with me
but if you insist on not being part of the plan then your loss kid <@375281006091173890>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:32:11 <@467459282250629120>  if you haven't realized we post it on youtube, because the biggest demographic of kids are there 
<@375281006091173890>  Your experienced won't be needed since you dont play the game anymore, i gave you an idea and if your too lazy ill do it for you, if your not, use it. Im giving you an oppurtunity to actually use your skills to respark plane crazys playerbase, this is not
an argument, stand down i am making a discussion of how we can get rick to respark his reason to make pc2. Thats what most wants
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:35:04 pls scroll down i've already explained it <@467459282250629120> 
and <@375281006091173890>  even though your better, i am not a shit builder
the numbers dont lie
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:37:11 <@778018583686021180> envision the idea and then talk about your opinion
<@467459282250629120>  if you don't want to proceed thats fine i have enough experience to do it myself
why does the responses look like i committed a crime
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:39:50 OK let me break it down, make a tutorial, a whitename and noobs can build, that looks really good, learn how it works by the instructions of tutorial, each video lasts 10 minutes and its a playlist to build each part. Give them an understanding how great builds are built. IF IT WORKS, rick will actually continue development of pc2, thus we get what we want.
<@467459282250629120>  well lets be professionals and not use emotions, how is that working. Creations chat are littered with basic builds
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:42:28 <@467459282250629120> that is true, however making A design, is the complicated park, where do they start
<@375281006091173890>  you just proved my point, The game is dead, this idea resparks it, he signed a contract to make better profits elsewhere.
If you don't understand roblox takes 90% of your profits from your game, furthermore the learning curve of the game is VERY difficult and im offering a solution
<@778018583686021180>  i digress what the creations chat presents
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 03:44:28 guys were having a discussion of how we can revive the game go to <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:48:55 now lets anylize why the idea is bad and how we can make it better, <@467459282250629120>  its not the locking its the foundation of the design, where do they start, not everyone is jet enthusiast,
<@375281006091173890>  developing a game is a job, and since its not worth it to make profit here its gone, 
2. everyone is lazy nothing has been done, if you want a testimonial then i will agree to do it
3. You cannot be part of it if your being very uninformative to improve the idea, i have experienced in video editing and design spaceships myself for some time, and a starter 3d modeler, i have merit.
this discussion wasnt designed to be offensive, if you really want to go down that path, many of the 5th level designers are REPLICATORS, NOT DESIGNERS
in short words, most of yall haven''t envisioned a design and replicated pre existing builds
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:05:06 we can discuss it on the the hangar but you left and plus you arugements are literally trying to put holes on an idea not build on it <@375281006091173890>  come on man,
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:08:34 who is that, but please enlighten, if you want to troll
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:10:37 <@738979597323862048>  check your dms i can give you that or we can vc on why its not good
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:20:00 because the profits of pc1 is ASS, 70% of your profits go to roblox not them
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:30:54

creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:23:51 guys, are yall whitenames by choice?
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:41:00 do you put materials on it
creations-chat 2023-06-10 01:17:36 im back
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:42:38 something is wrong with this game
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:48:32 I cant assemble my ship without getting 10k ping and more
my pc is high end
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:50:57 well supposedly, it would be my first tutorial build im gonna upload  but idk about user friendliness now
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:53:04 its a tutorial build where they learn, ship consists of storing a car, has vtol, improvised hover system, has 2 bedrooms, can reverse, has quantum drive, 
includes, most of locking systems
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:56:00 its a chance to start something new in this era on this game, ill make how to design guide, cause thats hard, except if your replicating
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:59:15 well thats already been tried, plus give the kids its an inspiration to use their own mind,  give em a physical model, that they can interact, so they can replicate the tutorial build on their next design but this time they design it their own
<@690931622345834527>  you got better ideas, we aint getting pc2 unless we respark the game again
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:03:42 well, you got a better idea <@690931622345834527>
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:05:45 So then, how do we grow the fanbase if no one thinks of something new, anything is viable at this point
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:08:32 yep im having that problem too, gives me 10k ping or more when using it in big builds
<@690931622345834527>  thats the problem, we can't get plane crazy 2, it seems rick has halted all development because the profits aren't worth it rn
freelancing devs isnt an option either, hence first reason
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:10:49 well being sitting ducks aint gonna help either, theres gotta be a way
<@523003901075521536>  whats the issue though, is it the lag part or something else
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:13:04 <@523003901075521536> show build?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:17:39 <@523003901075521536> which one out of the two has biggest block count
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:20:38 oh shii, the plane, if that thing has 50 piston i wonder how am gonna make this thing
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:22:50 if his is lagging, yours will crash and will be unplayable
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:28:06 cant use hoverdrives on my dropship for clean lift no more, this is my largest build so far, only has 6 pistons and it lags like crazy
not done
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:31:04 @<@775918490146177024> i believe we can still fly them, but no one can ride along with us.
creations-chat 2023-06-10 05:29:41 <@839668493602652182>  show build
creations-chat 2023-06-10 05:32:07 doesn't look like an su57, thats why 
you have to smoothen things out, so it actually looks like one, also more pictures help it view all sides, with orthographic view
mainly the pertruding sides of the thrusters
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:56:24 <@443752316240265226> Materials is key to making your builds look good,
do it right, and it will look like this 
also you not need to change building style to get more upvotes,
the new era demands, fluid, detailed, and sleek designs
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 08:57:45 practice
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:00:00 experiment and practice, use all locking systems also this ship you might like since its blocky
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:00:01 
creations-chat 2023-06-10 09:00:26 <@443752316240265226>you can do both unless its pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:03:00 <@443752316240265226> you only scratched the beginning part of it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:03:09 there are 4 more locking systems you have to learn
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:04:11 There are, camera locking, angled locking, motor 2 locking, magnet locking, and offset locking
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:04:16 time to evolve
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:04:23 search em up in yt
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:05:15 your beliefs is stopping you from being good

plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:16:08 Well, time to get a job or find a way to make online
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:16:36 You have 168 hours and sleep 56 hours a week
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:18:32 Then you have 112 hours  left in the week
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:19:25 <@782273655802429470>
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:21:00 Yes

plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:21:24 Left in the week
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:21:44 If you take 5 hours of doing other things
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:22:06 You have 35 hours left in a week
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 18:22:18 You have 35 hours of extra time per week

Hide the rockets inside the turret so the the gun doesn't look ugly, also give the tank more depth and give every details a purpose on how this tank is it going to be used. Is it a mbt that provides all needs for the crew and soldiers it supports or is it an undercover stealth tank?
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:14:03 <@811206250561273907>  well time to make it more reliable
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:14:58 More than that
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:15:03 Depends on your PC specks
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:15:09 Game is poorly optimized
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:15:20 So you need a high end PC to use that ship properly
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:15:43 Like gtx or rtx type of beat
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:25:28 <@694267776637861999>  why?
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 20:25:45 You know what I mean when I say high end pc right?
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:46:42 Well, try make the cannons look good while having the weapons at the same time, your gonna be forced to put the weapons inside so the gun looks good, 
details is important so it gives the build depth and purpose for its use
creations-chat 2023-06-13 01:04:26 <@937119057042358322> WHAT HE DO

plane-crazy 2023-06-13 19:58:00 <@761354294859005962> do you know what they do?
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 19:58:18 .
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:00:39 Very nice I give upvote
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:06:14 <@761354294859005962> how do you make material blocks look like that? What do you use
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:06:45 Oh what materials did they use to make it look like that
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:07:05 Look at the colors
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:07:11 They looked tarnished
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:07:14 And grayish
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:07:19 Not smooth like plastic
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:09:43 Ye
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:10:16 <@489806344388345857>  oh yeah how would we replicate that glitch in pc2 again?
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:10:26 <@489806344388345857>  magnet locking is great
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:10:41 You don't need the morlock tower once your done
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:11:16 <@489806344388345857>  yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:12:25 Too many sharp edges
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:14:11 <@1099529803792666637> if your going to make a jet, which is mostly circular. Has about 150 sides to make a full round circle if you take it in a designing software.
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:14:23 Making it without motorcycling only has the sides of 4
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:14:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:16:34 No
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:16:38 Still good
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:17:26 <@761354294859005962> creations is bad because it's all new players now, we need to wait
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:17:30 For them to get good
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:19:17 We might do that one day
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:19:36 We just either need hold off the meta until flight point gets better of pc2 comes out
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:19:55 <@761354294859005962> also now piston locking makes thing gives you 200k ping
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:29 <@1099529803792666637> nope
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:01 <@747972175440511106> 
New locking systems
The game hasn't been updated 
Rick is making pc2 but no updates
Most of everyone is toxic when critiquing builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:39 <@761354294859005962> how did it become so laggy
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:04 <@761354294859005962> so we need a new games
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:11 But at this point it shouldn't take 3 years
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:49 <@761354294859005962> shouldn't take 3 years
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:24:47 <@1099529803792666637>  Rick is either stuck on so etching he can't solve
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:25:02 Something
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:25:14 He is not hiring people
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:25:30 That is true
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:26:31 That is true
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:27:24 Well
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:27:29 So what we do until he comes back
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:27:53 <@450079852922404864>  time to make our own designs
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:28:46 just make it 70% accurate
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:28:49 and should be good
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:29:01 <@956349407484321833>  problem is lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:29:11 i looks good but you cant use it
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:29:17 now it just looks like were modeling
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:42:23 <@807746821467930684> yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:47:10 <@807746821467930684> i also realized something
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:47:29 if 70% are taken out of your profits on your game
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 21:47:31 money wose

creations-chat 2023-06-14 19:35:05 What happened guys
help 2023-06-14 19:36:18 <@610446020018700289>  ok now put materials that would fit the ship pretty well, cause right now it's all 1 material and it's smooth plastic
help 2023-06-15 05:10:09 <@963513431045046323> its doing that because when accelerating it, it generates force of whereever is thrusting, that is because the thrusters is located in the very top, i believe the fix for this, use hover thrusters and put them to 15 drag set them to control 0 and no speed, so you can give more balance to ship
help 2023-06-15 05:10:37 so you now need to distribute the ballast blocks, helium and hover thrusters until it gives you the desired balance
help 2023-06-15 05:29:19 <@793829260347310090> yes
help 2023-06-15 05:29:23 or what problem you having now
help 2023-06-15 05:31:50 <@793829260347310090>  helicopter is thrusting down because there is no counterweight on the back
help 2023-06-15 05:32:54 more ballast on the back
help 2023-06-15 05:33:45 if you added the ballast blocks now
help 2023-06-15 05:33:47 try flying again
help 2023-06-15 05:33:55 if not
help 2023-06-15 05:34:03 add more hover thrusters and wing pannels on the front
help 2023-06-15 05:37:27 i believe you added too much
creations-chat 2023-06-15 23:02:06 <@912065912658608190> what's wrong either copying, you should be grateful that your work is very reliable with everything and they can use that to make their own builds
creations-chat 2023-06-16 00:13:45 <@912065912658608190> copying, doesn't mean bad thing, it means people like what you built and want to have your reliable work, they want to copy because they want the model for themselves and use it for fun, and soon use it to make their own builds.
If were gonna talk about copying, lets take into account that 80% of good builders do that in this game.
creations-chat 2023-06-17 22:59:30 I discontinued that big ship i was making 2 weeks ago because it literally gives me 200k per assembly

plane-crazy 2023-06-17 23:04:20 yes
