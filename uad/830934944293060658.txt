general 2021-12-10 23:59:17 Like when I go into fly mode they don’t work
general 2021-12-10 23:59:36 Like the rocket engines specifically
general 2021-12-11 00:00:12 They just won’t work
general 2021-12-11 00:00:19 So annoying

events-chat 2022-01-09 02:38:50 Am I allowed to make turrets on my boat
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:39:15 Ok noice I’ll start building
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:41:38 I was thinking a pirate ship or a destroyer
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:43:02 Lol I’m picturing a pirate ship with turrets on it
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:44:13 I can’t make missiles tho
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:44:39 You can’t use explosive blocks unless they are mines or torpedoes
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:45:04 Unless you can get by saying “they’re air torpedoes lol”
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:46:06 I wanna make a guided missile like the ones in cod but I haven’t  figured out how to make the steering part
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:47:21 True
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:47:39 Mini destroyer lol
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:48:09 Yea you can’t have any amour
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:49:27 ?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:50:46 I was referring to motor locked armor and tnt armor
creations-chat 2022-01-11 03:13:04 Pretty good but maybe try hiding the exposed motor lock?

general 2022-05-30 01:35:47 Game where you shoot your teammates ass as they try to peak on the enemy’s
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:00:02 Is the roscaler method/formula A•0.7•2  accurate enough?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:00:30 Yeah I saw it on a yt video
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:00:37 They said it was accurate
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:01:16 A=length/height/width in meters of the vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:02:33 Can I see a better image of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:02:44 Like a front view or something
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:04:09 conveyer engine unless that’s what you mean by conveyer drives
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:05:22 I’d say maybe three blocks wide for the body using regular wedges bc it looks quite chonky in the images
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:13:58 I got ≈26 blocks (rounded up from 25.7) for an f/a-18e super hornet which is 18.3 meters
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:14:06 Or 60.3 feet
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:15:24 The one I said earlier (A•0.7•2)
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:17:36 A is the length/height/width in meters, 0.7 is the amount of meters per block, and the 2 is to make it make it more accurate as you are multiplying by a decimal so it will be a smaller value.
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:20:33 honestly I think it’s just taking an image showing the size comparison between a human and the vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:22:48 Like how they do the side by side comparisons between a human and a dinosaur
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:24:06 Prolly ice

plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:05:36 What
creations-chat 2022-06-22 16:12:52 ugh circular intakes are such a pain
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:30:32 Rip heli that fell in lava and sucks bc it’s not finished
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:31:33 And tips for stabilizing single rotor helis tho?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:31:59 Is it motorlocked?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:32:13 That’s prolly why lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:33:18 Is it normally for people behind you to start break dancing after seeing that video?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:35:01 P-57? If so I think the intake thing on the bottom might need to be more square shaped
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:35:15 But I need more pov’s
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:38:19 Yea irl it’s more of a rectangle before a more parabolic shape under it
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 00:40:20 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 21:28:43 Any tips to improve? (Note: I am not that good at the game <:nooo:787097964946259978>)
creations-chat 2022-07-09 21:31:13 How can I improve of if this (it is still work in progress)

plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:48:46 Bro said it was roscaled
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:49:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:49:43 It’s not mine though
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:50:12 He said it was tri folded to build limit
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:50:31 You just make something scaled to your character
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:50:40 Makes it more realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:51:22 There’s like a formula or sum
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:51:56 But you need to know the irl measurements of what ur making
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:52:39 Huh
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:54:00 No senpai
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 00:54:06 Jk
