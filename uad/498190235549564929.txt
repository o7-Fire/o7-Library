The Tale of EnterTest (498190235549564929)
general 2021-01-09 00:52:25 i'm just wondering this is widely discussed
general 2021-01-09 00:52:35 is it acceptable to use shredders against shredders or people abusing them
general 2021-01-09 00:53:27 thats why people use them against shredders
general 2021-01-09 00:54:22 rockets like the rocket you press f to send?
general 2021-01-09 00:55:11 what is it called those swarm of army things on the floor
general 2021-01-09 00:55:16 there is a gun on each one
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 00:56:25 what is the most effective way to destroy fast moving shredders / armies other than using shredders
general 2021-01-09 00:58:21 what is the most effective way to destroy fast moving shredders / armies other than using shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:03:59 mostly
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:04:02 like between 1-10
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:04:07 and why is it called shredder bugs again
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:05:55 what is a missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:06:30 what tf is a missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:06:33 i never heard of that
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:06:45 unless you are the tutorial maker
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:06:58 i saw shredders go 2500 speed once
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:00 estimate
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:07 it zoomed across the map in a few seconds
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:21 imagine a army of that
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:50 i saw some plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:53 it turns like a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:07:56 and bends like one
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:08:03 i think its a shredder disguised as a plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:08:27 it sure did
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:08:31 and it destroyed my mech
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:08:53 i made some simple r6 avatar mech
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:08:56 with hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:09:00 it hovers very way
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:09:01 well
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:09:02 and has rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:09:08 so it can fly to stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:11:13 i'm just wondering
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:11:16 what is a missile again
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:11:39 so its a shredder with a sword
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:13:25 hm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:13:30 i saw thingsl ike that
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:14:18 I think its Barack
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:18:24 our map is so small
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:18:45 theres just not so much possiblity in the map
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:20:14 do you guys think a bigger  and newer map would be best to focus on or something else
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:20:36 the map we have is just so boring
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:20:38 theres not much to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:21:04 they could atleast like modify the map
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:21:14 there isn't so much room for fighting and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:21:26 though i still think game mechanics would be better
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:22:17 they could atleast just make the flat space (the space on the plots that is black)
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:22:19 bigger
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:22:28 Activate the
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:22:30 T U R R E T
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:37 If you guys are bored in plane crazy I found something perfect to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:43 Get something like a mech or big plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:45 And while in mid air
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:46 Reset
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:51 All of the parts fall and bounce on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:53 It looks so nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:23:59 and satisfying
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:26:07 Tbh I think making space around the plots bigger would be a very good suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:29:05 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:29:26 why is it called shredder "bug"
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:29:28 i'm just wondering
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:30:57 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:31:04 i thought it was because they thought it was a bug
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 01:31:06 like game bug
