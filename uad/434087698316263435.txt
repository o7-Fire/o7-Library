creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:32:03 it's a simple subjective dislike
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:34:35 i'm obviously the minority so that doesn't matter much
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:47:10 what did you even post? i can't see any of yours to even downvote them
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:51:46 wow thanks...his latest post was Sep 30 and i didn't touch those
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:17:38 do i have to? and it's not about standards, it's preferences
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:25:21 >not standards, preferences
"oh no high standards!"
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:27:23 yes and? i'm not good at motor lock, that's obvious 
you guys are the ones butthurt about me downvoting, yet the people in this channel said it's "just some fake internet points" a while ago, so why does it matter?


Good thing most of the things i downvoted, were also downvoted a bit by other users (even if it's less than upvotes)
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:31:07 ????


ahaha now you're accusing me of using an alt?

no i didn't, and you have no proof i did
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:33:27 smh imagine lying just to get your point across, i did not touch that post
creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:35:43 yes so what? that build looks weird and barebones 

"photo proof , if i want to caught you in 4k i can do it anytime "

creations-chat 2021-10-02 18:40:33 that's not what i referred to but okay.

creations-chat 2021-10-25 06:26:59 White name bad, okay?
If I don't have a rank, then why even care if I downvote? Not like you would listen to a white rank opinion
creations-chat 2021-10-25 06:29:25 Damn casual images in casual channel, scary
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:35:47 Yeah the whole rear area
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:38:41 I don't see how that's related, i already know my builds don't belong there
creations-chat 2021-10-25 11:47:10 No one told you to care
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:06:06 >is white name
>Downvote anything I don't like
>Make everyone cry about it
>They don't care about my opinion either way so I don't care either 
>Leaves
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:08:20 No
<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:13:05 reported for having a negative opinion lel, 
you people said "they're just fake internet points so don't care about them" when i asked why some decent builds got mass downvoted before, so it's fine for me to do the same if i want
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:15:10 go cry to the mods about it and don't cry to me, k? thanks < 3
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:19:07 i'm doing fine here tbh
creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:31:53 who are you even? "kid" <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2021-10-25 12:58:58 "he already started an arguement in creations feedback"
i didn't start shit lmao, maybe tell people to stop pinging me because i downvoted something
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:01:00 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> 
How about you stop caring so much
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:04:02 Cya bye
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:06:30 How nice, he's visiting her grave 
<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:19:34 "and says his are good while the rest are trash " 
HAHAH NICE LYING
what an actual loser


and you're gonna keep lying lmao?
<@!721103577380159490> they're all mad i downvote stuff they liked, i didn't get downvoted
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:22:05 ban the liar instead
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:25:13 "says his builds are good while the rest are trash "
"he got downvoted, and thinks he is bullied by us?" -> "Yes"
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:27:32 okay ? don't care, i don't downvote everything, i downvote what i don't like.
SO, stop spreading complete lies.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:30:53 sure, i didn't start this anyway
creations-chat 2021-10-25 13:56:33 keep breathing that copium lmao, "ridiculing" you're not doing shit
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:03:00 always a joke when it's convenient for you, of course.
and the usual "offended" when you can't find another comeback
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:09:31 """you always bring out your degree in psychology on why everyone else is wrong and it's "your opinion" """

yes, everyone ridiculing me for downvoting is wrong, but i never NEVER said their opinion on the build was wrong, it's a VOTING system for a reason, not everyone is going to have the same opinion.
so, stop getting offended about me defending myself 

"lmao, pipe down kid" weak insults
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:14:13 is that really the best response you got? i just happened to make an actual response instead of typing random insults like a monkey
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:20:39 "he doesn't like anything"
not that you know the stuff i upvoted.

"the tiniest ugly part will make him downvote"
complete random statement
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:25:37 "you also don't look at most of the build and just start finding the bad parts"
and you know that how?

<@!552343549572677632> i upvoted all those big detailed trucks, like the one with the opening sides in the trailer, also the F-2 viper, and the MiG-41 and the Latest Katyusha with the rockets
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:28:37 >Makes completely random statement
>gets asked how but doesn't answer
>"it's true"

<@!376049059695165440> i just prefer doing it, gets the point across
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:35:29 >doesn't have a rank or build in creations 
doesn't matter to me, i'm sure most people who upvote don't have builds or ranks either. 

>down votes almost everything
already proved not true

>"its just some points"
what the channel said, including people like you
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:45:07 "have to stop mass downvotes cool build and do downvotes with a better conclusion?"
why am i the one actually losing something here?

<@!715148402022678608> "i said almost you dingleberry handpump" 
not even almost lol
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:49:25 a good percentage of the builds i downvote already have a few other downvotes btw
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:53:04 why not? i'm replying to specific points, and to multiple people , it helps
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:00:20 I'd say change the colors here
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:04:11 yknow, the purple (that's purple behind the white wedge in triangle, right?), grey and white overlapping
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:18:56 Yeah this is what I thinking of, show the whole plane now
creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:25:10 It's kinda hard to see the edges with the colors, so maybe if you make that grey wedge shorter?
Of course you can keep it if you want
creations-chat 2021-10-25 17:41:44 Oh yeah
creations-chat 2021-10-25 19:30:20 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
