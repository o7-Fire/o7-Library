plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:14:42 idk why i didnt just use that in the first place lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:15:21 its nice and round where the body is though so thats nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:16:37 better than anything ive built lol id give it a 9/10
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:17:06 all i would add is a flatter bottom i guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:17:24 the ballon shape is on point though
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:17:33 on the bottom of the deck
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:17:44 id like round the cockpit in more
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:18:17 oh ok i didnt know lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:18:22 is good yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:18:47 oooh nice f4 tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:19:16 my f4 is pretty garbage lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:20:32 f4 phantom but bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:21:47 yeaah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:22:17 yours is very clean too lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:22:42 eh all of my builds are pretty garbage
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:23:33 id say maybe my cleanest build is an airwolf i built
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:25:03 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:25:22 even then its pretty blocky looking
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:27:13 and maybe my b2 that barely turns
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:28:21 yeah i couldnt find a place of the guns lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:28:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:30:10 yeah that is definitely better
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:32:49 i also tried to make the intakes *a bit* less weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:33:03 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 08:35:13 damn that very nice doe ðŸ‘€
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:19:57 wait nvm what do you mean
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:23:38 it does use some basic motorlock but it does reach the height limit due to its wingspan. i still made the damn thing though it took days. granted i did build it around early 2020 so its been sitting in my saves
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:28:36 idk my building has always been pretty shotty but motorlock is used in alot of the rest of my stuff because i ususally build small. but since this is big it uses like i think 4 actual locking motors. all the others rotate the pannels to make it nice and smooth
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:32:47 damn dude thats better than my ornithopter i never finished. it creates the same motion in a space thats way more compact. i hope it doestn bug out as much as mine
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:35:07 plus yours seems to work as intended too whereas mine acts more like a glider somehow.
