general 2018-12-16 22:50:42 So like, logging in and out fixes the fact I clicked the link?
general 2018-12-16 22:50:51 That's all?
general 2018-12-16 22:51:12 I don't need to like, clear my cache or restart my computer or change all of my passwords or anything?
general 2018-12-16 22:51:33 Love it üëå‚ô•Ô∏è
general 2018-12-16 22:51:44 In announcements
general 2018-12-16 22:52:02 Oh shoot
general 2018-12-16 22:52:04 Wrong server
general 2018-12-16 22:52:13 Well like there was this robux Christmas link
general 2018-12-16 22:52:28 Everyone has been pasting it around and apparently it steals your cookies or something
general 2018-12-16 22:52:43 It can get into your account without you giving the password
general 2018-12-16 22:52:51 Supposedly the way to fix it is to log in and out
general 2018-12-16 22:53:13 I was in another airplane kinda group and thought this was the one that announced it lmao
