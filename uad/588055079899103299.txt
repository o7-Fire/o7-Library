creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:19:17 how are single rotor swashplates balanced
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:19:39 o
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:19:58 that's still unbalanced as ||what||
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:21:08 ***E***
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:21:43 oof
creations-chat 2020-05-19 22:23:43 uh oh
general 2020-05-21 20:16:18 the number is the amount of mines around the square in the 3x3 around it
general 2020-05-21 20:16:26 everything revolves around that
general 2020-05-21 20:23:21 no
general 2020-05-21 20:24:00 that would cancel everything out
general 2020-05-21 20:24:28 idk but it's a weird way that each panel rotates individually to produce more thrust in certain parts
general 2020-05-21 20:24:38 like a hellish swashplate
general 2020-05-21 20:24:47 but idk how it actually works
general 2020-05-21 20:26:08 not many people have tried making it for good reason tho
general 2020-05-21 20:29:44 you have to be able to change it only on certain points
general 2020-05-21 20:29:58 so you have to divide into sections
general 2020-05-21 20:30:10 but idk how you're supposed to do that on this
general 2020-05-21 20:30:29 you can't change all of them to the same thing
general 2020-05-21 20:30:45 you have to only change the part where you want more thrust
general 2020-05-21 20:31:13 <@!587459840255983616>  why do you wanna do this anyway
general 2020-05-21 20:31:24 nice
general 2020-05-21 20:32:00 those would have to be huge wheels tho
general 2020-05-21 20:32:19 you can't make traditional ones in plane crazy
general 2020-05-21 20:32:32 ye
general 2020-05-21 20:32:54 you'll have to divide the panels into sections tho
general 2020-05-21 20:32:59 it calls for a redesign
general 2020-05-21 20:33:04 idK
general 2020-05-21 20:34:06 WAIT
general 2020-05-21 20:34:13 I have an idea
general 2020-05-21 20:34:28 idk why nobody has thought of this for swashplates
general 2020-05-21 20:34:54 make the blades independent on an powered motor
general 2020-05-21 20:35:19 and use pistons to change directions in certain parts
general 2020-05-21 20:35:28 wait
general 2020-05-21 20:35:48 the ones without pistons would work tho ;-;
general 2020-05-21 20:35:52 oh well
general 2020-05-21 20:35:57 I'm out of ideas
creations-chat 2020-05-21 22:00:35 isn't that a norm?
creations-chat 2020-05-21 22:00:46 ok
creations-chat 2020-05-21 22:00:50 nice going tho
creations-chat 2020-05-21 23:13:22 how are you supposed to spwan the train
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:01:32 plane crazy just makes you appreciate how efficient engines are in real life
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:01:50 IMAGINE IF THIS WOULD WORK IN THE GAME
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:01:55 no like
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:01:57 ouY DOuAWTd 7iAWdi6aW D6ADu
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:02:09 these tiny engines carry that thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:02:19 what if we could do that in the game
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:02:41 ye
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:50 ah
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:54 bog bren

creations-chat 2020-05-22 21:07:35 oh it's from self upvote
creations-chat 2020-05-22 21:07:43 *that's even worse*
creations-chat 2020-05-22 22:03:52 oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 06:20:18 ropes are really great for realistic heli mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 06:22:42 is this an original idea or has someone else thought of it already
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 06:26:23 it's great if ur too smol brain for swashplates
general 2020-05-25 06:27:00 ropes are great for realistic heli mechanics
general 2020-05-25 06:27:03 great if ur too smol brain for swashplates
general 2020-05-25 06:27:21 is this an original idea or has someone thought of this already
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:44:12 no I don't think that's why
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:44:26 from that view it seems like a noob jet
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:44:33 but it's not
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:44:41 damn outlines
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:44:55 that's why I didn't like that at first
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:45:03 but I changed my mind
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:47:14 try a view from the bottom and paint the intake a distinct color so people can see the f16
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:48:19 I think it would look cool on a jet not a car
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:48:26 is that what you're going for?
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:48:42 oof
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:48:57 looking good tho
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:49:21 that would be hard to fit inside of anything tho
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:49:57 probably wouldn't fit tho
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:50:01 am I wrong?

creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:01:51 (uses ropes for control)
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:02:01 (realistic heli mechanics)
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:15:33 post it directly
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:52:42 you need at least 40 upvotes
general 2020-05-29 06:17:35 why was the contest removed
creations-chat 2020-05-30 03:57:27 If you haven't noticed, my apache is controled by ropes with no external thrust. Please use it! A pet peeve of mine in the game has always been how unrealistically helicopters fly. I've found a simple solution!
creations-chat 2020-05-30 03:59:02 hey man it's just an option
creations-chat 2020-05-30 03:59:09 you can use it if you want to

plane-crazy 2020-06-21 23:14:57 > Because you cant make mouse guided ailerons
<@!311996873650995200>  you can make mouse guided ailerons with inverted motor 2s
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 23:15:18 or you can do what everyone else does and just fill the wing to the brim with control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:56:43 it uses hover engines
creations-chat 2020-06-24 06:05:36 you do realize
creations-chat 2020-06-24 06:05:51 you can make a delorean without the parachutes right?

creations-chat 2020-12-18 23:42:29 kinda peak mediocrity seemingly rushed
creations-chat 2020-12-18 23:46:12 try building bigger as a crutch (as you can see I can't stop building big) so you have more space to experiment with techniques, and don't leave out little quirks in the design. if you feel comfortable start building smaller
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:47:46 help this was supposed to be small

plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:10 if someone else posted it
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:26 this isn't torb's system
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:31 this is pcc's system
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:41 it doesn't only apply to you
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:55 I'm not
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:21:59 **mmm**
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:08 I'm not standing up specifically for you
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:15 if someone were to post that
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:22 they would get designer 3
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:33 alright
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:35 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:36 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:39 I'm saying
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:47 the build itself is worth designer 3
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:22:52 but I don't think it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:08 the build itself is worth designer 3 to the new standard
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:22 alright
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:24 picture this
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:36 *picture this*
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:41 listen
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:43 if you dropped in
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:45 new to pcc
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:51 but huge experience
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:54 very good builder
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:23:59 and you posted the a10
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:24:18 normally you would get easy designer V
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:24:22 you earned it
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:24:33 designer 3 isn't impressive
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:24:39 but there's a new standard
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:24:49 that a10 is worth designer 3
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:25:13 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:25:15 wait a second
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:25:28 think about the people who have designer 3
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:25:35 and who had it for a long time
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:25:54 because people are **still applying for roles**
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:26:03 and some builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:26:09 are not getting rated properly
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:26:24 ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:26:45 I check my downvote lists like the stressed asswipe I am lmao
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:27:19 because you already have designer V
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:27:43 imagine not overdosing on ketamine

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 15:59:17 I prefer having a longer load time for a better game

creations-chat 2022-03-24 03:22:34 ahmed stop complaining about people pinging you it's not like anyone actually wants to talk to you
creations-chat 2022-03-24 03:29:46 it's a bit under roscale it looks off because it's using the smallest blocks available but they aren't small enough (turret is disproportionately tall)
imo
haven't built in a year though idk
creations-chat 2022-03-24 03:33:54 yeah I wouldn't be able to come up with a solution
the turret is just a little too tall for the rest

<@456226577798135808> mb just me being dumb
creations-chat 2022-03-24 03:36:27 around 1:2.5 turret to hull or something

I recognize that it's very difficult thanks for putting that out there
I just wanted to explain why it looks a little off to other people
personally I like the build
creations-chat 2022-03-31 02:36:33 it's just blocks with signs nobody really cares

but use dull colors
and a color picker anyway

creations-chat 2022-06-22 21:33:51 flex those cheeks for me please I played plane crazy once I am so lonely
creations-chat 2022-07-05 18:33:59 honestly choose another jet
f35 doesn't really work without ungodly angle lock
creations-chat 2022-07-05 18:36:18 he is built 🥶

<@693234235380727860> just don't I honestly don't trust that you can pull it off
do an f/a-18c or mig 29
creations-chat 2022-07-05 18:39:01 I don't want to watch you fail
creations-chat 2022-07-06 19:27:19 ok

it's alright I still think you shouldn't be doing an f35

dozens have people have tried and failed
over the past 2 years I saw one that I thought was cool and the rest of the server didn't like it
creations-chat 2022-07-06 19:34:20 I'm not being petty I'm telling you that I seriously doubt that you have the skill to make a change

I never even built an f-35 I've just watched way too many people try
creations-chat 2022-07-06 19:36:56 another one bites the dust ig
tried to tell him
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:14:06 I don't even care about the post
how
what game is that
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:17:48 it's not funny when you defend it 💀
insulting the crowd doesn't flatter anyone
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:20:36 seriously how did he pull this off
it has roblox engine shadow limitations this is IN ENGINE
and the builds properly light the carrier wtf

<@559568621312147476> but how
how did he get models of pc builds
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:23:49 I'm just curious what exploits he used
I am well aware that something is off
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:25:54 roblox definitely safegaurds you from importing full fucking models into any game let alone one on the front page
most people can't even do that in games with modding support

pc builds as models is pretty likely
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:29:43 holy shit
honestly impressed
I thought it was a roblox studio game this shithead actually did it
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:33:13 there's tens of rebuilds if you search for them but I've never seen somebody import models into existing games
contest-chat 2022-07-16 01:15:52 nice pixel art
