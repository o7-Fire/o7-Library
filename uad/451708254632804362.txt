general 2022-10-08 06:49:27 The newest hof build was half a year ago
general 2022-10-08 06:49:54 You do realise hof isn’t decided by mods
general 2022-10-08 06:50:49 The mods don’t even make up half of the votes
general 2022-10-08 06:51:05 There are more people in vip lounge than you think

general 2022-10-08 06:54:16 I think you just have skill issue
general 2022-10-08 06:55:01 Standards change, doesn’t mean the standard for being “at the top” changes
general 2022-10-08 06:55:38 Does hars still exist or is he a myth now

general 2022-10-08 07:03:40 Could be both
general 2022-10-08 07:04:31 I thought leaving this place would do something to my life since I spent most of my time being a discord rat but i just used the time I spent on discord playing games so it did nothing
general 2022-10-08 07:04:34 Agh
general 2022-10-08 07:05:00 Honestly disappointed in myself
general 2022-10-08 07:05:18 It wasn’t even an addiction, I just don’t like doing work at all
general 2022-10-08 07:05:23 I think you call that laziness
general 2022-10-08 07:05:48 Like I can have sudden bursts of motivation that dies out after 15 minutes

general 2022-10-08 07:19:16 Building skill hasn’t went up in forever as well though
general 2022-10-08 07:20:41 Mans learning
general 2022-10-08 07:21:41 Shaders make it look hot, take them off and it’ll only look like a decent roscale build
general 2022-10-08 07:22:11 But man did a good job hiding the lock

general 2022-10-08 10:28:33 According to my brain I should stop making it at 80% completion
general 2022-10-08 10:28:51 All that’s left is the track guard, tracks and random detail
general 2022-10-08 10:29:00 The main shape is done
general 2022-10-08 10:29:10 Without the track guards it look kinda off
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:29:34 Outdated
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:29:36 I made a few changes already
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:29:39 But it’s generally like this
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:29:58 What do you expect
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:30:00 It’s been a year
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 10:30:25 It degraded to end 2020

general 2022-10-08 10:59:43 The only use for it now is to communicate with gamma
general 2022-10-08 10:59:58 Since I need him to teach me a few techniques
general 2022-10-08 11:00:24 His art of making 7x7 plot builds has been lost
general 2022-10-08 11:00:27 Which is disappointing
general 2022-10-08 11:00:43 True
general 2022-10-08 11:00:57 ~~he’s still going to make then 7x7 plots (the new plots)~~

general 2022-10-08 11:20:45 It was a good balance
general 2022-10-08 11:21:00 That tank struck a good balance between detail and addition
general 2022-10-08 11:21:03 Yes
general 2022-10-08 11:21:08 Feel like it’s still the best

general 2022-10-08 13:33:59 Idk man
general 2022-10-08 13:34:01 Unnatural
general 2022-10-08 13:34:26 Notice the shadows of the plane and the bomb
general 2022-10-08 13:34:30 The whole illusion falls apart
general 2022-10-08 13:34:48 Roblox problem
general 2022-10-08 13:34:58 Just edit the base image probably
general 2022-10-08 13:35:21 Lower the contrast, lower the saturation a small bit and lower the exposure as well
general 2022-10-08 13:35:25 Yea I can
general 2022-10-08 13:35:27 I can tell
general 2022-10-08 13:35:28 Lol

general 2022-10-08 13:36:29 So you can edit the plane
general 2022-10-08 13:36:34 Unique taste
general 2022-10-08 13:36:41 Hm

general 2022-10-08 13:37:29 Ik
general 2022-10-08 13:37:52 You should do separate edits to the plane first before overlaying it over the picture
general 2022-10-08 13:38:30 Change hues contrast exposure
general 2022-10-08 13:42:06 I get those 2k ping spikes
general 2022-10-08 13:43:36 Bismarck roscale 
References for you:
0.7 meters = 1 block
general 2022-10-08 13:44:19 Roscale Bismarck harder to make
general 2022-10-08 13:46:03 Roscale Bismarck is 345 blocks long at the waterline and 358.5 blocks long overall, now make it
general 2022-10-08 13:46:45 It is 50 blocks wide and 13 blocks tall from waterline to deck
general 2022-10-08 13:47:15 I’d you can’t make it you have skill issue
general 2022-10-08 13:47:38 You also <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-10-08 13:47:59 We tried to make roscale ships but it wouldn’t even fit in the plot
general 2022-10-08 13:48:05 So it was quite a failure
general 2022-10-08 13:48:31 0.7 meters is 1 block, use that reference t make something
general 2022-10-08 13:48:44 Yea precisely
general 2022-10-08 13:48:54 Why don’t you make it if you’re so smart
general 2022-10-08 13:49:18 I know

general 2022-10-08 13:50:24 We need to bring back hars to scare a few people
general 2022-10-08 13:50:50 Unneeded
general 2022-10-08 13:50:52 Unnecessary
general 2022-10-08 13:51:06 Unnecessary until someone like you starts a riot amirite
general 2022-10-08 13:51:23 Eh high standards are good
general 2022-10-08 13:51:32 Weeding out the weak
general 2022-10-08 13:51:57 He needs to show them 9 year olds what an actual build is
general 2022-10-08 13:52:16 I can go hars mode, but my skill degraded past my standards I think
general 2022-10-08 13:52:59 If there’s anyone who makes roscale Bismarck it’s gammarad
general 2022-10-08 13:53:22 We go together
general 2022-10-08 13:54:16 Get past me first, my skill probably hitting its lowest point soon if I don’t push myself to make something good
