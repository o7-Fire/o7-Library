help 2018-11-25 14:23:39 You use propeller blades and motors
help 2018-11-25 14:29:09 these are unaligned
help 2018-11-25 14:29:16 your aircraft is too heavy on its front
help 2018-11-25 14:29:47 either place more blocks behind it, or delete some of those panels
help 2018-11-25 14:30:49 well, its basically that, I don't think the ballasts are doing much, you will have to delete some of those flaps
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:02:59 you need to convince it to atleast become centrist
the-dump 2018-11-26 22:02:35 you have been decieved
