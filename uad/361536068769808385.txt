plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:15:58 hey I'm quite new to the game and I cant seem to get my plane to turn. Is there a special material that lets me turn my plane?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:17:06 control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:17:39 I have a bunch of those on my wings but they only let me go up and down
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:27:01 <@!408782856274575370> thank you for all the help!
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:27:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 10:36:26 my plane seems to always start tilting to the back and start going straight up when I fly it, is there some sort of material that's super heavy in order to get my center of mass in a good position?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 10:38:20 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 10:38:36 ballast tanks or just blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 10:38:50 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 11:18:16 is there a block in the game which looks like this tip
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 11:18:17 
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 11:18:20 kinda just the shape

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:48:27 my plane is turning VERY slowly, is there any way to make it turn faster?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:48:43 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:50:01 uh what are those?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:53:07 I am having trouble with both yaw and roll
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:53:11 *
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:55:02 basically my plane is stuck on one side after turning
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:55:19 and its very hard to turn the opposite way
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:55:48 hold on let me use pictures
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:56:56 its ugly but
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:56:58 
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:57:08 after turning to the right like that
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:57:13 it gets stuck
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:58:08 I played since 3 days ago ðŸ˜Ž
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:01:25 guys pls tell me how to make sharper turns happen ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:46:36 how do I make my plane turn better
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:48:06 what do you mean by motor 2 flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:51:55 I placed a motor 2 with servo enabled but It doesn't seem to make too big of a difference
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:52:53 my plane tends to stay leaning to one side after turning
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:54:20 
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:54:29 it kinda just stays like this
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:55:55 its not black but yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 12:31:22 my plane is having trouble turning, what should I place?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 12:33:06 nvm I fixed it
