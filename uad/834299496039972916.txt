plane-crazy 2023-02-28 13:44:40 smoother then normal unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 13:45:19 no uuh not for steering
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 13:45:25 for the suspension it self
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 13:45:59 people say its smoother then normal suspension
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 13:46:05 and you can use it like a shock
