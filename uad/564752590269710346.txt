Panzer III with working tracks (realistic ish size)
creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:54:08 good length for a panzer?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:57:29 i recommend using a normal motor at a slow speed like .1 or .075, lock the motors and keep them powered (this should stop them moving on their own), and maybe try to have the rotor systems attached to each other on one beam, then have that beam connected to the main body.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 04:00:25 yes it can cause bugs, but if done right, it can make it more stable. ( for the panzer, its a 1 - 1.25 scale | panzer III / IV
creations-chat 2021-12-19 04:03:04 good internet or try lower the graphics (im good with the physics and the rotors of helicopters, but im trash at making them look good)

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:50:37 Very sus ww2 German uniforms
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:51:58 The black uniforms arenât panzer uniforms
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:19 They are the âsusâ division uniforms
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:37 Indeed
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:52:53 You are aware of what the ss did right?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:53:21 **itâs against roblox tos**
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:53:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:53:58 So is all the other bypassed swas shirts
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:20 The ss is the division that rounded up the Jews and operated the camps
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:54:27 Thatâs why Iâm mentioning it
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:55:19 The waffen ss is the field branch
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:55:28 They went out into combat zones and took the Jews
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:56:04 No
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:56:31 Im saying those uniforms will attract a lot of unwanted attention
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:56:54 You know that Iâm quite literally an expert on ww2 Germany
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:57:47 Yea because I know what they are
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:58:09 And your literally defending wearing ss uniforms
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 09:58:50 Not you
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:00:07 Itâs literally the ss
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:00:45 You would understand if you knew how they operate and how they traveled
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:01:00 Their only goal as ss
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:01:25 Is to specifically do moustache mans personal bidding
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:04:17 What next, your going to argue that moustache man is worse than Stalin, even though Stalin killed more people
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:04:46 Im not
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:05:00 Your just saying that the waffen ss uniforms are ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:06:01 So if I went out in public without nsdap symbols on a ss uniform it wouldnât be frowned upon
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:16 But people do
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:07:43 No they do
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:00 But you said
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:14 I never said itâs the norm
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:26 Now your assuming things
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:46 Besides
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:52 Doesnât matter the context
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:57 Wearing ss uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:08:59 Isnât ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:09:58 Itâs ss
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:10:14 Yâknow
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:10:29 Doesnât matter
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:10:41 Itâs frowned upon irl why should it be ok in roblox
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:11:37 And besides
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:12 Ss uniforms or anything that represents ss uniforms is against roblox terms of service
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:35 They do get taken down
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:12:55 Latvian ss
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:13:19 The ss is the loyalty league
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:14:00 I do
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:14:21 Y know the conscripts were used as cannon fodder
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:15:08 90% of the people who were ss were war criminals
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:15:46 Shooting civilians
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:15:59 Operating the camps
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:12 Itâs common senses
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:34 Itâs the damn ss
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:16:51 Why were so many of them tried as war criminals
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:24 People do
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:17:49 The lack of brain cells you idiots have is giving me a stroke
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:19:31 You are literally arguing in favour of ss uniforms
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:19:49 Just think about that
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:20:33 And a single insult isnât insulting everyone every 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:24:25 I said the uniform stands for something bad
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:25:05 Thatâs like saying, âim from New York, not Americaâ
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:27:31 The waffen ss, all their videos of them banned from youtube, their uniforms deleted daily from roblox.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:27:56 And they itâs still ok to say the waffen ss uniform doesnât stand for something bad
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:28:14 Maybe there is a reason that they mock the devil in their anthem
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:19 Even if that is the case
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 10:29:34 You still defended the waffen ss uniform
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 11:59:47 The reichsmatch (itâs a nickname for a plane that caught fire a lot, canât remember the actual name)
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:00:21 Typically German bomber
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:05:19 Better than any tank I could make
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:05:54 One of the two
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:06:12 And add a cool feature where it catches fire
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:06:30 Or u would be missing the most important ability of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:07:57 Spaceship, how does it look?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:09:17 Kinda
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 12:09:39 Loosely based from some picture on the internet that I canât find anymore
